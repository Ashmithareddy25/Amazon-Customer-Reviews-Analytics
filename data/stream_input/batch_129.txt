B00003CXE7|5.0|While there are many historical &quot;stretches&quot; I enjoyed this movie for what it really is:  entertainment.  The scenery, set and costuming is excellent and well worth the money.  Russell Crowe is the up and coming action hero and he lives up to it in this movie.  If you enjoy action films, period pieces or your a history buff you'll find something to enjoy in the viewing!

B00004XONN|5.0|In the past, Radiohead has offered music that I wouldn't exactly call rock, more like alterna-rock. Their music was good but, I got bored with the same old stuff after a while. When I got this album, I fell in love! I just loved their new style, the songs gave way to a broader imagination. The one thing that distracts people from the greatness of this album, is that because it is new to them and they don't understand it, they simply do not like it. People start to label it as a techie cd, but is really not. It's not like anything else out there. This album has so much creativity in it. It is beyond anything else, I hope that it paves way for future albums alike.
6304698658|5.0|My husband and I watch this movie several times each year. Its one of our favorites. We always get lots of laughs even though we have seen the movie over and over. Its priceless and there should have been another Holiday sequel to it. I recommend it highly as well as &quot;One Magic Christmas&quot; for a good family evenings entertainment.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a good  book for all ages.  It is full of good lessons and morals. I teaches you to follow your conscience and be a person of compassion.  The setting is a sleepy town in 1930's alabama.  It is mostly about two children growing up in this town and learning about the evil in the human heart and losing their inocence. They also learn to be children of compassion and conscience. They learn this mostly through the character of Boo Radley their next door neighbor.  The town treats him as a disgrace and blames him for most of the problems. The children finally learn of his situation and realize they should have compassion for him. It also centers on racism in a way through the case of Tom Robinson it show how hunams can be cruel and unfair to one another.  Overall this was a good book and i recomend it to all ages of readers. ....
B000003BDJ|5.0|This is a great compilation album of the Stones' best music.  Sure, they have made some good albums since, however this was  their best period, by far.  <br />The first CD is incredible with songs such as the laid back &quot;Time after Time&quot;, the fulfilling &quot;Can't get no Satisfaction&quot;, the remarkable and dark &quot;Paint it Black&quot;, the fun &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;, and the seductive &quot;Let's spend some time together&quot;.<br />The second CD is less sensational: however still has some great tracks.<br />If you, like me, enjoy some of the Stones' music, but would not call yourself a true Stones fan - then this &quot;BEST OF&quot; album will suffice as many of the songs that you have heard and love are featured.  <br />A brilliant addition to your collection.
0684853523|5.0|For a guy who has scared the daylights out of the reading public for the last twenty five years, Stephen King sure knows how to take the fear out of the art of writing.  With this volume, part biography and part how to manual, he imparts his secrets not just about writing but about living, and doing both with courage and honesty.<br />    The first biographical section is downright hysterical at times, as King describes his hardscrabble youth using anecdotes about his fatally flagellant nanny and his unfortunate accidental use of poison ivy as toilet paper.  He makes the drudgery of lower middle class life sound like kind of a blast, filled with squalid adventures and endowed with the wisdom of the insane characters around him.  At the same the pain of that life comes through the laughter with a poignancy that oozes with truth.  The daily struggles of his mother as a laundress and single mother raising two boys, the petty cruelties of children, the sadism of underpaid doctors--these things hint at why he's so fascinated by the dark, while keeping faith with the light.<br />It's a credit to King's funny, self-effacing style that when he describes his reaction to the life-changing success of his novel &quot;Carrie&quot;, no aspiring writer could ever feel the slightest jelousy or resentment.  It's impossible not to share his thrill, and the delight of the possibilities ahead. King is so generous with his thoughts that we're really taking the ride with him when we read &quot;On Writing&quot;.<br />The instruction part of the book is rife with common sense, specific stylistic guideslines, and some of the funniest bad writing examples to be found anywhere. Some of these are sure to make a writing student cringe at himself, but he'll be laughing too hard to take it too much to heart.  And there are plenty of examples of fine writing on offer as well.<br />Stay concise, don't use adverbs, less is better, read a ton, work hard, be persistent,write with honesty.  These are some of the many golden nuggets any aspiring writer will take away from this book. All of them teach a little something about the best way to live and express yourself, for writer and non-writer alike.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I thought this movie was great-I laughed my head off-and I have never seen &quot;scream&quot; or &quot;I know what you did..&quot;. I loved the little dick jokes-it's about time they came though for women. (they always show women-but never men) But to see this movie-you do have to be a little open minded-or it will be offensive.
B00004XQP4|3.0|this is an ok green day cd. i give them credit that they made it different, but in my opinion, some songs just aren't doing it for me. its their 4th best cd out of their 6 made. minority made me think &quot;yeh man it's green day&quot; but when i bought the cd there was crappy meaningless acoustic songs. the songs i do like are warning, church on sunday, misery (this is good), jackass, waiting, and of course minority. the best is a toss-up between minority and waiting. misery has never been played before by anyone except mystery movies. so some songs are good, all the other ones are bad.
0399146253|3.0|I've been a fan of the Kay Scarpetta series since the beginning, but it's become more and more difficult to justify my enthusiasm for Cornwell with Scarpetta's last few outings. The series has become less and less about forensic medicine and suspense and more about the characters' psyches. Unfortunately, while Cornwell's talents in creating suspense and intriguing forensic cases are beyond doubt, her skill as a writer of introspective psycho-prose is shaky. Scarpetta, Marino and Lucy have all become less and less interesting as we've purportedly learned more about them. Marino used to be a classic gruff-but-lovable cop. Now he's just gruff. At best. And while I sympathize with Cornwell's desire to present a strong, intelligent lesbian character in Lucy, the constant references to Lucy's sexuality and to her amazing capabilities (is there anything she CAN'T do??) make her a less interesting figure. Cornwell would do greater justice to this issue simply by toning the character down and making her real, interesting, and appealing. All of that said, I think TLP is a step, albeit a tentative one, back toward the old-style Scarpetta novels. Although there's still plenty of psychologizing and still plenty of emotional tedium, there's also some solid suspense and somewhat of a return to the forensic elements of the &quot;classic&quot; novels earlier in the series. I felt just a little bit vindicated for the the time and energy I spent on &quot;Black Notice&quot; since it formed the backdrop for a more interesting story this time around.  (&quot;Black Notice&quot; is the only Scarpetta book I've ever seriously considered putting down halfway through.) It seems inevitable that we'll have at least one more story centered around Le Loup Garou, Berger, Talley, et al. Here's hoping Cornwell will then draw this line to close and get back to basics. I think most of her fans would be grateful.
6305776326|3.0|This wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't the worst. Some of the jokes are downright stupid, but I like when she makes out with the tree. The ending is pretty dumb considering all the details, and then it gets even dumber just after...but who's idea was it to tell a kid their parents got ripped apart viciously by hammerhead sharks?
0140283587|4.0|William Sutcliffe's cynical approach fits the generation he describes perfectly, and Dave, the lead character could be a spokesperson for doomed youth. Bored in his gap year, Dave undertakes the trip of a lifetime- into his newfound friend and co-traveller Liz's pants. Unfortunately to get there Dave has to follow Liz to hot, frightening India with all it's menacing beggars, indigestable food, dysentry and worst of all, a plethora of hippie travellers all mith mind-crushingly dull &quot;India Theories&quot;. Unlike his fellow travellers looking for spiritual epiphany and life-changing experiences, Dave is perfectly honest about what he wants to get out of his trip to India- as much sex as possible with Liz and a cute little paragraph for his CV.  Unfortunately it's clear from the start that Liz and Dave have a clear conflict of interest, as Liz begins to reach Nirvana precisely at the time Dave discovers the best thing about India is the quality cheap dope. But as Sutcliffe's darkly humorous story evolves, it's clear that neither one of them has any real interest in &quot;challenging their cultural assumptions&quot; as we learn about Liz's seedy encounter with Yoga and Dave's wretched but hilarous experience with a lamb burger. Whats clearest of all is the ethnocentric attitudes of the main characters- Sutcliffe paints a picture of the youth of Britain abroad perfectly. And the scene with the Reuters journalist is priceless, I'd buy the book for this alone!
6304341849|5.0|...just a wonderful film on all counts... certainly one of Merchant/Ivory's lesser known films...more than likely because of its' theme of homosexuality but certainly one of their best! James Wilby is splendid in the lead and even Hugh Grant, who I sometimes find rather wooden is quite good but Rupert Graves is electifying as the gamekeeper! This role should have made him a superstar on par with Olivier! He is touching, heartbreaking and utterly believable in such a demanding role. NOTE: you simply must read the E. M. Forster novel on which this film was based. The man is a true literary giant!
B000009PNY|4.0|Depeche Mode aren't usually a band you see or hear much glorification about. But a career that has lasted almost 20 years speaks for itself, as the contributers to this tribute album certainly know. Having survived critical indifference (until Violator shut the critics up, then made them talk in 1990), numerous band member desertions and clinical death in the case of the magnificently gaunt frontman Dave Gahan, it's a small wonder Depeche Mode are still here. So it's pleasing to see that this tribute album doesn't just go for the well known tracks (thank God nobody's tried to improve upon Personal Jesus), but includes some choice cuts from their extensive back catalogue.  Highlights of which are Gus Gus's \\"Monument\\", a darker version than DM's and in my opinion the better for it; Rabbit In The Moon's version of \\"Waiting for the Night\\" is pure delight, updating the trancey 1990 dark synth-pop to late 90's breakbeat, with heartbreaking vocals easily rivaling Martin Gore. The best track for me is God Lives Underwater's reworking of \\"Fly on the Windscreen\\", giving the track a harder, more rock edge compared to it's former keyboard-led incarnation. Surprisingly the tracks that let this album down are the ones covered by the more well known bands. Smashing Pumpkins version of \\"Never Let Me Down\\" is, frankly, at best a soothing mediocre pastiche, and at worst a lifeless stroll through the motions. Apollo Four-forty's rehash of \\"I Feel You\\" lacks the relentless pounding rhythm and intense vocal performance of the original, and surprisingly none of the tongue-in-cheek humour of Apollo Four-forty's other work shines through in this either. I can't decide whether Rammstein's version of \\"Stripped\\" is merely naively hysterical or plain trash- I just know it's stripped the original version of all it's sinister subtlety and replaced it with harsh grinding metal.  Many of the tracks however have managed to encapsulate, if not emulate the sense of humour and spirit of experimentation in all of Depeche Modes work; Hooverphonic's \\"Shake The Disease\\" and Locust's \\"Master and Servant\\" are good examples. I'm not sure whether this is an album for hardcore Depeche Mode fans: you may not appreciate the different takes on your favourite songs. But for alternative music fans it is a must, if only for the sheer breadth of style represented here by artists such as The Cure, Monster Magnet and Meat Beat Manifesto.
B000000WA4|5.0|All to few bands even attempt to branch out in to other generes, and even fewer are able to do them well. The Smashing Pumpkins have done both. From psychedelic electronica (1979), to heavy metal (XYU), to industrial (Tales of Schorched Earth), to somber ballads (Galapigos), to completely original, Pumpkins style (Jelly Belly, Bullet with Butterfly Wings) they create a hauntingly beutiful esthetic masterpiece. Somehow they are able to retain both the innocence of a garage band with the knowledge of superstars. I recomend this CD to anyone who's already an fan of the Pumpkins or rock; its equal enjoyable to a 45 year old raised on the Beattles as it is to a 25 year old Nirvana-lover and everyone between.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I clearly remember how I first heard Lenny Kravitz songs - I had driven to Toronto to spend a weekend with my boyfriend, and he made me up a tape of songs to listen to. They played all weekend, and in the car on my way home again, and I listened to them many, many times in the years since. Each one was different, speaking to a different part of me.<br />Sure, they're not deep social commentary, but they're great to listen to, cover a wide range of emotions, and this CD packs them all into one neat collection. Enjoy!
0425170349|1.0|I thought I'd give Clancy a try - after all, so many people read his books on the train that I am taking to work.  What a disappointment!  The writing is poor, the characters are 2 dimensional.  I suppose &quot;Rainbow 6&quot; could be a comic book.
B00003CXBK|4.0|Look, I notice for all the detracters of this movie, they've hyped up the plot to a point where it's impossible to meet their bloated standards. People who have not watched the movie with a neutral eye should kindly stfu. That being said:<br />Animation was great, action was great, but as for plot and storyline progression, it felt a little slow to me. The movie could be better if it was 20 minutes or so shorter. The english dub version is great (for anime dubs, that is), and the quality of the dub is hard to find in any anime anywhere. It is a far cry from the traditional hyper 12-year old sounding no-namer voices. The DVD (last I checked) provided a Japanese and English language track for those of you die hard sub fans.<br />This is a great movie.
B000002NC4|5.0|This is by far one of the best bands that I know of at the moment.  I picked up this album a few years back and it was a great decision.  Hurt a Fly is my favorite song, but the others all come in at a close second.  For anyone who likes melodic and semi-psychedelic sounding music, this is the album for you.
0671004107|5.0|I have read numerous science fiction novels and this is by far the best I have ever found. I have read several of Carl Sagans other fact-based scientific books and am not surprised that he could make this story so believable. The story is based on radio astronomy and the SETI (search for extra-terrestrial intelligence) program.<br />The main character, scientist Dr. Ellie Arroway, finally receives a radio message from space that turns out to be the instructions for building a machine. The story revolves around the machine and what happens when it is built and used. A truly gripping tale that will keep you spellbound till the end.<br />This is the best science fiction tale ever written, Thanks Carl.
0140067477|5.0|I'm 52 now....but when I was a kid I knew that Pooh knew the way.  He was the greatest then (and now), and, thanks to this book, I now know why.  This book is not only a wonderful intro to Taoism, it is also a confirmation of what every child hopes for and secretly knows.  Because in the western world, Pooh is more well known than the Tao and he is known to the child within us, he is the perfect prophet.<br />Bravo...this book captures all the awards...it is profound yet so simple that even a child can see the truth in it.<br />A Must Read for People who have or want to have a soul.
630575067X|1.0|For anyone who has seen the other star wars movies, this movie was a huge disappointment. It felt more like a  made for tv movie than the most anticipated Movie ever.<br />I lost a lot of respect for George Lucas for using [poor] computer generated special effects instead of using  miniatures as they had done in the past. He probably saw  'the matrix' and said, yea I can do that. But he could not.<br />The plot was thin, the characters not even close to being engaging. Darth Maul (only exciting character) did not have enough presence to be anything close to Darth Vader.<br />George please let someone else direct the next episodes.  Don't let your ego destroy this legacy.
B000002NE4|5.0|&quot;The Boatman's Call&quot; is an amazing record. If anyone has their doubts about Nick Cave as I did, they need to hear this record. Nick Cave the God of sorrowful music explores God, Love and of course sadness but instead this time we are offered a record that tries to move forward from the bitter past and looks for hope in religion and love. <br />My first impression of Nick Cave was buying the &quot;Best Of Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds&quot; album which left me confused and a bit frightened. There were no doubt, some glorious songs but I had trouble taking in Nick Cave's early work. I thought perhaps it was because of the selection of the compilation and that I needed a full album to enjoy his work. I bought &quot;The Boatman's Call&quot; which made me realize Nick Cave's greatness and spawned an interest in him.<br />Most of the songs on this album are piano-solo slow jazz based. It opens with Nick Cave's best single &quot;Into My Arms&quot; and my personal favorite on the album, &quot;Lime-Tree Arbour&quot;. &quot;People 'Aint No Good&quot; is a bit redundant and boring at first but after a few listens becomes enjoyable. &quot;Brompton Oratory&quot; is another strong song that has a Church organ infuelnce. &quot;There Is A Kingdom&quot; which brings to mind, a church hymn. &quot;(Are You) The One That I've Been Looking For?&quot; reminds me of material from the album, &quot;The Good Son&quot;. Songs that are a little short of masterpieces. &quot;West Country Girl&quot; sets the mood into an Irish Celtic and shifts from the piano-jazz style throughout the beginning of the record. The album ends with the poetry reciting &quot;Green Eyes&quot; and the listener is hopefully left breathless.<br />&quot;The Boatman's Call&quot; is an album for empty souls yearning for joy and happiness; that have too longed suffered in a big mean world.
B000002GQK|4.0|Every Good Boy Deserves Favour is the first Moody's album since prior to Days Of Future Passed (when the future Wings member Denny Laine led the group) that is not a concept album.  Each band member wrote songs that appear on the album and it was a refreshing break as the band was threatening to become pretentious.  Despite the lack of a common theme, the songs still retain that classic Moody's sound, symphonic mixed with rock.  &quot;The Story In Your Eyes&quot; is one of their all time best songs and &quot;Emily's Song&quot; is also quite good.  &quot;You Can Never Go Home&quot; is a sweet and pretty tune as is &quot;One More Time To Live&quot;.  The album was their most popular to date and it set the stage for the re-release of Days Of Future Passed.
0671015206|3.0|This book is a fascinating read. <br />Before you read this book (or maybe after) - you must ask yourself - why would I want to be a millionaire? I may have missed something - but the only reason the authors seem to stress was that you could survive x number of years without having to draw a paycheck. The higher the value of x - the better. While that maybe a goal for some people, it certainly is not my cup of tea. <br />Also, this book is definitely an afterthought from some research study and hence is chock full of statistics. One of the statistics that the authors tend to dwell on (and on and on) is dollar amount per poundage of car weight. Bizzare. I am not sure what this means, but seems like an interesting byproduct of stastical analysis. So if I buy the heaviest car for the least price - I am ....? Also, as another reviewer correctly points out - it does focus on a specific group of individuals and hence does not address other groups who may aspire to be millionaires someday.<br />But the book through many examples does illustrate the concept of thrift. I just hope everyone does not start practicing thrift - the golf and tennis clubs would go bankrupt and Marshalls and TJ Maxx would rule!!
0679879269|5.0|I have just finished reading The Amber Spyglass after listening to the Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife. This trilogy is a masterpiece. Just as the Christmas story is a metaphor about the coming of Spirit into our world, these three stories describe the struggle between Religion and its concept of a God that inspires inquisitions and holy wars where the innocent are killed and tortured and the concept of a God that is Spirit, that is not anthropomorphized, that is Love, Truth and Beauty. &quot;Dust&quot; is a concept of a God that is everywhere, that is an indwelling Spirit. These books are beautifully written with a cast of characters that inspire or repel. They hold our interest.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Another album from a talentless band.  One chord, the f-word, and a whiny voice.  Very complex song writing wouldnt you say.  If I were you dont waste your money on this crap.  If you are into rock.  There are plenty of good rock bands with good albums to spend your money on.  Or if rap is your thing, the same thing applies.  Please do not support this band.  If we don't support, the sooner they will go away.  And by the way Scott.  Why are you helping this band out?  Keep making great records with STP.
B0000524E5|1.0|Like the few ADULT reviewers here, my 30-something GF and I decided to sit through this to its bitter end just to see if the dialog could get worse... It did!  It was like the staged MTV &quot;real world&quot; shows... Adults are stupid.... You can survive being dewey eyed in NYC?  GAG!  When the heroine opened her mouth the first time, my GF and I both cringed at her voice.  Her name needed to be &quot;Bambi&quot;.  Then there was the hapless daddy.  Then there was everything else.  About the time the heroine and hero are doing the teen aged ga-ga thing and uttering mind numbing trivia to each other, and my GF is making motions like she is going to heave into her popcorn, I glanced over at the row of teenaged girls next to us - they were enraptured!<br />As I said.... Great film if you're under 16 !<br />Unlike one of the other reviewers who noted all the idiocy going on in the bar (like the overpouring which is both illegal and irresponsible), I will dismiss this as aimed directly at a teenaged audience without a shred of real world experience (I owned a large bar and saloon), and thus literary license. <br />I gave it ONE star for TWO reasons:  The first is ...  rate it with negative stars..... and the second is that there was some genuine stompin' music....  Interrupted only occasionally by the shrill screeching of the heroine and the other mindless dialog.
0553106635|5.0|GRRM has set THE NEW BENCHMARK by which any and all other fantasy books must strive to attain. After reading these books, no longer will the consumate fantasy reader have to endure another &quot;downtrodden boy discovers magic powers and must go north to defeat the evil lord&quot; (aka Shannara) or &quot;downtrodden boy discovers magic power and becomes near-godlike, but must still travel north and defeat evil lord&quot; (aka Wheel of Time and Sword of Truth). Fantasy authors will now HAVE to change that tried and true formula that Tolkien began oh so many years ago. GRRM has breathed total and absolute new life into our stagnant genre. NOTHING I have read before has even come close in terms of character development, intricate storytelling, and ultimately, grand scope and plotting of his mythical world. Just by reading the first book, you KNOW that GRRM has every detail of his story planned out waaaay ahead of time - things vaguely mentioned in Book 1, become suddenly clear in Book 3. Unlike the pitiful Wheel of Time series where you can tell jordan has absolutely NO idea where he is going (at least, that's the impression I still get reading the reviews. I personally quit WoT at book 5 - reading 1000 page tomes where nothing happens annoys me.) But jordan is content to keep on rambling as long as maroons keep putting his books at #1. Why people? But believe me, it really won't be long before GRRM usurps and takes his rightful place at the TOP where he truly belongs! I treasure these books - I just ordered A Game of Thrones in hardback from the man himself, (signing included) and have also ordered Books 2 &amp; 3 in hardback as well. AND these books are so good, I am now reading Book 1 out loud every evening to my wife during our newly discovered &quot;storytime&quot; - she loves for me to read it to her, and I love reading it again so I can soak up all the minute details and apply them to my better understanding of this unspeakably intricate plot. I can't wait for us to get to Book 3 and read &quot;The Red Wedding&quot; scene. Anybody who has read these books should understand my utter reverance for them, and if you haven't read them, soak your jordan &amp; goodkind books in lighter fluid, start a big bonfire in the dark of night, and dance around it naked while you revel in the ectasy that is A Song of Ice &amp; Fire.
B000050XEI|2.0|This album would get 3 stars on its own, but it gets 2 for a few reasons. It doesn't really seem to go anywhere for one. Don't get me wrong, I love Enya's music, but sometimes I wish she would make an album that wasn't &quot;Watermark...part whatever.&quot; The songs are well crafted and beautifully sung, but they all sound like they could belong on any of her previous albums. If you like Enya and don't want her to change or evolve, then you'll love this album, but if you want to see a new direction or more influences, you might be disappointed.
0395759242|5.0|The recordings in this book finely epitomize the greed and terror wielded by the ghosts of those greedy and grey white men of the past. All done in the name of &quot;honey&quot;! <br />The book plainly shows how these deeds of evil can actually be interpreted as having [had] a direct bearing on the crumbling status quo of today's vast Congo, even of today's Africa. And since Leopold's ruthless tactics are just one European example, among many, there were other white men like him -- hungry, greedy and grey; who were &quot;restless&quot;, it seems, and always hunting for treasure, scrounging for a living in Africa! <br />The book boldly unmasks famous names like Henry Morton Stanley and the reader is shown just how brutal and low the human conscience can sink, and yet we know and read about all these adventurous men today as &quot;heroes&quot; or &quot;pioneers&quot; or something similar to that. Wow! ... ???<br />I very much enjoyed reading this book, although the brutality in it didn't really surprise me. There are still many people in our world today who would openly brag about this evil. A good reading!
0944379044|4.0|I became interested in Hitler greatly in high school history class, and should've bought the book then. No complaint other than it drags. I like politics also, because out of reason rather than genuinely wanting to be different, I differ greatly in political stance. What he says in some ways has bearing in real life. It's so funny, too. Most people view anything they deem deviant with bias. This is real world history- not just some racist talking. Hitler is an icon- the media made him one just like Charles Manson. Manson was a scapegoat for the love generation, Hitler was a scapegoat for the melting pot generation. Imagine what a swell world we would live in instead of a mixed world resulting in all these problems.

630339406X|4.0|Honestly, has Tom Hanks ever been better than he was here?  Could anyone have pulled off what he accomplished?  What an extraordinary job he did of conveying childhood as an adult.  There are too many moments of brilliance (of both hilarity and poignance) in this performance to pinpoint; I'll just say instead that the shot of the boy in a man's clothes near the end brought tears to my eyes when I first saw it (not to Hanks' credit but director Penny Marshall's).<br />Spoiler:<br />I like this movie enough, though, to be disturbed by what I felt was a bit of post-production tinkering in an attempt to soften the melancholy ending.  I'm convinced that when Hanks and Perkins are walking away from the camera on the boardwalk, what we hear them say as he puts his arm around her was dubbed afterwards; it only served to assure us that she would &quot;be OK&quot; in the end.  The moment itself would have felt right played without dialogue.  Likewise, the voices of the boy and his mother in the house at the end felt a bit contrived.  And -- this is what I've heard from others as well -- the lovely shot of Perkins' car driving off into the distance over the &quot;School Crossing&quot; sign on the road should have been the fadeout; the two boys walking away together felt anticlimactic.  Whenever I watch it, I always either stop the tape or change the channel before that image appears.  It just feels better that way.

I expected the sort of criticism I saw in a post about &quot;American Beauty,&quot; in which the writer said that people who couldn't appreciate that one would probably like dreck like &quot;Die Hard.&quot;  Well, &quot;Die Hard&quot; is the better film, because (1) it sets out to do something more admirable and (2) it achieves it.  It sets out to be not just an action thriller, but a generous and original one.  (&quot;American Beauty&quot; was anything but original, and now enough said about that.)  Look at all of the genuine humor laced throughout the dialogue.  Look at how so many scenes appear to have been written, then written again and again, as if the screenwriter said, &quot;OK, we've moved the plot along here; now, how can we make this moment even more complex and hair-raising?&quot;<br />This is the one Hollywood action movie that has been truly well thought out.  Every seemingly inconsequential thing -- including McClane's fear of flying (&quot;fists with your toes&quot;) to Holly slamming his photo face-down on the credenza -- turns out to be crucial to the plot!  That was so impressive.<br />And has there ever been an action twist as delicious as Gruber confronting McClane when the latter doesn't know who Gruber really is (or does he?).  The theater audiences almost giggled with delight and tension.  Not to mention the leap off the roof -- the pivotal moment by which all other Big Action Scenes need to be judged.  And right there is an example of the generous filmmakers giving us more than we might ordinarily expect -- moments after the leap, we get (1) the possibility of his being stuck dangling there, and (2) the absolutely sweat-inducing moments immediately following his solution to the dangling situation (I'm not giving too much away).  (My only complaint about the leap is that McClane would have been gripping that hose for dear life, not throwing his hands over his head.  That, and the fact that his double had longer hair that was slicked back.)<br />The whole terrorists vs. common thieves element also adds to our pure enjoyment -- instead of being thrust into a contemporary plot, the sort of which we usually go to the movies to escape, we get a story as elemental as a Roy Rogers western.  So it's appropriate that McClane's signature expression should be -- well, I can't say here.<br />See this one, but see it in widescreen: there's at least one moment -- in the lobby of the tower -- when the suspense in pan-and-scan is non-existent because you literally can't see that one of the protagonists is unknowingly walking within a few feet of one of the bad guys.that his double had longer hair that was slicked back.)<br />The whole terrorists vs. common thieves element also adds to our pure enjoyment -- instead of being thrust into a contemporary plot, the sort of which we usually go to the movies to escape, we get a story as elemental as a Roy Rogers western.

B000003TBP|5.0|I bought Odelay after hear him preform on some kind of late show (Jay Leno?).  He played devil's haircut to promote his new album.  Like alot of other people, I went and bought this. <br /> Odelay is a great collection of songs.  Not one of them really drags.  Try to get the one with the international tracks on them if you are going to purchase it.  The bonus track fits perfectly with the rest of the cd. <br /> Beck's music is a combination of hip hop, pop, and blues.  I am not a big fan of hip hop, but this is alot different than reg. hip hop music.  If you don't like hip hop, don't think that this is a cd with alot of swearing and no rhythm, Beck plays many, many instruments. This is def. worth buying.  It will be remembered as an essential cd for future cd buyers.  BUY IT NOW!
630289915X|5.0|The best thing about this movie is Stewart's intensity in conveying George Bailey's despair.  The moment in the bar when he prays for help ranks with his breakdown in &quot;Vertigo&quot; and his barroom(!) rage in &quot;Winchester 76.&quot;<br />The worst thing about this movie, the thing I laughed out loud over without even meaning to the first time I saw it, is Clarence's revelation about Bailey's wife never marrying -- not only is she an &quot;old maid&quot; (that went with the times), but &quot;she's just about to close the library!&quot;
0800128052|5.0|It is unbelieveable that one man could have such heart and ambition in somthing he really truly loves. This movie makes you want to go out and do something meaningful in your life. You are right there with Rudy; hurting, fighting, winning. And all that ambition actually leads to something good. This is the perfect tale about having the courage to follow your dreams and do whatever it takes to make that dream happen.
B00004U30D|3.0|For the first time, another contributor to these blurbs has echoed exactly what I feel about a product.  &quot;pacebm&quot; nailed my conflicting feelings about &quot;American Beauty&quot; in that it was riveting to watch because of the acting and the visual style, and yet basically the story was one big cliche populated by a cast of cliched characters.  Go ahead and scroll down to &quot;pacebm's&quot; review for more details; he or she did a nice job of analyzing all the weaknesses.  The one thing I didn't catch anyone mentioning was how one-dimensional the gay couple is (and how they also happen to be the only people in the neighborhood who aren't dysfunctional).
B000050FEN|3.0|The plot mechanisms of  *Seven*  are undoubtedly clever:  a maniac somewhere out there is murdering people, one by one, in order to illustrate some pithy points about the good ole Seven Sins  (Gluttony, etc., etc.).  This surprisingly old-fashioned mystery device is imbued by director David Fincher with some of the most ghastly palettes I've ever seen in a movie:  lowering grays of the sky, horrible rusts of the buildings of the inner city, cavernous greens of barely lighted interiors, et al.  The photography contributes to make  *Seven*  one of the most morose movies ever filmed.  Another contributing factor is Morgan Freeman's stunning performance as the head detective on the case, seven days from retirement, and deeply depressed.  The fact that Freeman makes this character, which is really a cliche, so compelling speaks volumes about his talent.  (Is this guy EVER going to get an Academy Award?  Talk about a Deadly Sin!)  Brad Pitt is -- for once -- perfectly cast as his cocky partner, providing a nice shallow contrast to Freeman's gloomy depths.<br />The movie loses ground, I think, after it prematurely reveals to the audience who the killer is  (Kevin Spacey, doing his  &quot;Kevin Spacey&quot;  thing; in other words, Phoning It In).  Most of the second and third acts involve a rather tiresome cat-and-mouse game.  Nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before -- although, granted, the STYLE in which this is done keeps us morbidly watching.  And the ending succeeds in its aim, which is apparently to leave a very bad taste in your mouth.  (One removes the DVD from the player as if it's a dead wolf spider or something.)<br />Not the  &quot;classic&quot;  some make it out to be, *Seven*  is nonetheless recommendable work by a director who really knows how to put grand muck on film.  Definitely recommended over his later film, the execrable  *Fight Club*.
0767903854|5.0|I picked this book up intending only to glance through a few pages. I ended up putting other books I was reading on hold, finishing it a few days later. <br />Australia is a big country to attempt to travel over, especially in a short time. Geographically, it is nearly the size of the USA. You are never going to fit everything in in a book with the scope of this one. Bryson does extremely well to cover as much as he does. He does so with erudition, grace and wit. There were a few times when I laughed out loud.<br />I have lived in Australia for most of my life and been to a fair amount of the places mentioned in the text. However, I must admit to not knowing a large proportion of the facts Bryson gives us (and that's after I've studied 4 years of Australian history at university as well.) I found the information on plants and animals fascinating.<br />I appreciated the graciousness with which this book is written.  Difficult issues such as reconciliation are handled with tact. Bryson seems like the sort of person who would be a good man to have a beer with. Perhaps another of the reasons he found the country so congenial!<br />Highly recommended.
B00004XONN|1.0|Radiohead's Kid A has been critically lauded and all the critics think it is the cat's pajamas, but ultimately, for sheer entertainment value, it fails. The entire album is slow, muffled and just plain boring, such as the pervasive, synthesised drone of `Idioteque' or the weird instrumental misfire of `Kid A' (the song). Ultimately, Kid A is an album that may well be a triumph of art-house and avant-garde music - a revisiting of David Bowie's Berlin Trilogy days - but if you're in the market for something entertaining, Kid A is not the way to go.    <br />  Radiohead's previous album, OK Computer, was excellent. They had wavered just enough from the contemporary musical scene to produce something unique, entertaining and melodic; however, with Kid A, they have bitten off a little more than they can chew. This is one of those `indulge me' albums that a band puts out to try something new and offbeat, like `Fear of Music' for the Talking Heads, or `Frank's Wild Years' for Tom Waits. The aforementioned albums, however, are both excellent: the artists succeeded in making their new sound not just unique and individual, but also compelling and entertaining for the listener. In contrast, Kid A does not succeed in achieving this. The album is just a series of droning, slow `pieces' (they can't really be called songs) that ostensibly have some hidden meaning, and probably do (the critics seem to love it), but it's just not something you can hum or tap along to. It doesn't even feel like music. <br />  Which is fine. All of this is my opinion, and nobody else's. All I'm saying is that it didn't entertain me - the majority of people out there seem to love it, just like some people love Finnegans Wake, and others don't. Therefore, Kid A is a very subjective album, like English Literature - it can mean a number of things to a number of people. Yet, like English Literature, if one doesn't look for the subtext and the hidden themes, it's just plain boring (see: Middlemarch). Listening to Kid A, I have searched for a subtext but I haven't found one, which probably just boils down to my fledgling perspicacity. As Beth Massa said: \\"The band's future-perfect musical grammar may be hard to decipher, and the melody is even more subliminal,\\" but I, like many people, don't have the patience to sit and listen to something that fails to at least get my toes tapping or me singing along. So many people may love subliminal melodies and indecipherable grammar, but not this cowboy.

052594527X|5.0|Girl With A Pearl is an amazing book!  Art, romance and history all wrapped up in beautiful little package.  Read it and weep.
0446310786|4.0|My first memory of the book To Kill a Mockingbird came in the eighth grade.  We had to bring a book to school to show to our teacher.  Well, I forgot my book.  I knew we were reading To Kill a Mockingbird in ninth grade and it looked really boring but she didn't know that i knew.  My teacher said it was an honest mistake.  I was relieved because I had gotten away with it and I sure didn't want to read it.  Then came the day we had to start reading it and I found out that it wasn't as bad as I thought, but it was actually good.      The main character in this book is Jean Louise Finch, otherwise known as Scout.  She is young, stubborn, and a tom boy.  Her older brother, Jem, grows up and matures in this book.  They have a friend named Dill who spends the summer with them and loves to exagerate.  Atticus, Jem and Scout's father, is a hard working and honest man.  His sister, Aunt Alexandra, comes to live with them to help raise the children and she is very tough to live with.     There are two themes in this book.  The first one is the Need for Compassion and Understanding.  Atticus tells his children that they should get into the other person's skin and walk around in it.  This means that they would see things from the other person's view and they would be more compassionate and would understand what the other person is going through.  One important character in this book is Author (Boo) Radley.  Author stays in his house all the time and the kids are scared of him.  They realize what he has to go through and are more compassionate towards him.      The other theme is the Need for Conscience and Courage.  Atticus is a man of conscience and courage.  He takes a case where there seems like he has no chance of winning.  This case is for Tom Robinson, a black man, who was charged for rape on a white woman.  Atticus can't turn down the case because he feels he can't live with himself if he does. This took a lot of courage and shows what kind of man Atticus is.
B000003TBP|5.0|Beck is the modern times version of Frank Zappa except he makes more sense to people (no offense to Zappa fans). He mixes things so well of electronic, country, old jazz like a music a blender. Highly recommened.
6300271145|3.0|Yes, it's annoying that the plot hadda have some idealistic and passionate white French guy offer salvation to the tortured and irresponsible Negro jazz musician, but the movie is an enjoyable character study.  Dexter Gordon gives an undeniably riveting portrayal of the quintissential jazz cat and the climactic outdoor memorial concert is great.
B00000IAU3|5.0|If you are looking for a surpisingly good new artist, look no futher than dido and her new album.  I was blown away.
B00004X01U|5.0|After 2.5 months of debating wether I should buy the album, I finally bought &quot;MUSIC&quot;. As soon as I heard Madonna's current single &quot;Don't tell me&quot; I decided I had to check it out. I was very surprised at how simplistic yet electronically charged this album is. Her lyrics are simply amazing and the arrangements in some of the songs are simply breathtaking. I will recommend this album to everyone who is tired of the pop fluff that has been dominating the music industry. &quot;Music&quot; not a conventional pop album. It is funky, cutting edge, 21st century music that has a message. In short, this is a breathtaking album by an artist who does not get the recognition she deserves for bettering the music that's out there.
6305910103|4.0|STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN-  This is one of the most action packed Treks in the series.  Nearly breaking the PG/PG-13 barrier with its violent sequences and nature. Khan [Ricardo Maltobaun} is ruthless in his attempts on seeking revenge on Admiral James T. Kirk.  Based the the television episode &quot;Space Seed&quot; Khan and his people were left marooned on a desolate planet years ago by Kirk, for trying to kill him and the Enterprise crew. Now years later, a Federation starship lands on the planet, only to discover Khan and his malevolent men.  Khan takes over their ship and the plot to take revenge on Kirk begins.  The plot involves a new project the federation is working on called GENESIS, which creates life on planets that do not have it.  It is described as a devise that will help overpopulation, and put life on lifeless planets.  We also learn that this could be converted to a terrible weapon.  Once Khan takes control of his new starship, he goes after Kirk in a deadly showdown, that is bloody and violent.  There are awesome  cat and mouse space battle sceenes.  The sound and picture are commendable, however bare in mind this movie was made in the early 80's, so a little distortion may be seen.  As far as special features go, we only get a theatrical trailer.  Im assuming once they release all the film individually on DVD they will assembal a nice STAR TREK PAK involving more Special Features.  Im sure it will be worth the wait, and that's all we can do right now.. so sit tight.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is the granddaddy of them all! My favorite album of all time! Limp Bizkit scared me for a minuet. I thought he would have another album like significant other! I was wrong!!! &quot;Choclate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water&quot; has shown great improvement and skill from the band, Limp Bizkit. I am going to review every song as I usually do. Before I do, I have to say something. There is not one song on this album that I don't like! It will have you jumping around all night! I HIGHLY recommend that you buy this. It's well worth your money.<br />1. Intro: Very good intro from them. Comming in at over a minuet, this is the best inro they've put out yet!<br />2. Hotdog: WICKED GOOD SONG!!!! It's the &quot;swear song&quot; on this album. If you buy it, you'll find out why! Wiced good gutairs in this song. Good lyrics, drums, and vocals from fred. Just an awesome song!<br />3. My Generation: Everybody knows this song and that its good! Good riffs and drums. Good vocals. The lyrics are kinda awkward. But it's still a good song!<br />4. Full Nelson: AWESOME! Good drums and riffs. Really good screaming from fred. Good drums too. Hey, did you know that after fred sung to this whole album, he lost his voice for a while?<br />5. My way: Good song. Kinda related to Rearanged. Good song because it has some hard rock parts in it.<br />6. Rollin [air raid veichle]: You all know this song too right. It's the one that you hear on the radio. It's just good. Peroid.<br />7. Livin' it Up: Possibaly the best song on the album! Really messed up lyrics. But really good gutairs and drums. This song gets you REALLY pumped up after a while! Good song!<br />8. The one: Really good mellow song. Some hard parts in it. <br />9. Getcha groove on: Good rap song with Xhibit. They make a good team for raping.<br />10. Take a look around: this is the one. the MI2 song. Really good lyrics. Good Drums. Good job Wes Borland!!!<br />11. It'll be ok: At first I thought this song was a slow andbad song. But now I listen to it all the time. It has many hard rock parts in it that I never knew about! Goods listen!<br />12. Boilier: Good refrain!!!!!! The other parts of the song are okay but they did a really good job on the refrain!<br />13. Hold on: Ugh! Man what was he thinking? He needs some improvment on this song, BAD!!!<br />14. Rollin [urban assult veichle]: Good remix of rollin [air raid veichle.] Has DMX, Red Man, Method man and someone else in it. This song is probally the longes song on the album. [not including outro which is about 10 minutes.] This song clocks in at about 6 minutes!<br />15. Outro: Ok outro except it says on the cover that this song is about 2 minutes. It's really about 10 minutes! It's all talking that's kinda annoying. Pretty good listen.<br />So this album earns a 5 star rating for it's excellence in all of the songs except for one. This album is the longest one I have, comming in at 75 minutes! <br />Well worth your money! Trust me!!!
B000051VWW|3.0|I've always loved Sade and have all of her albumns.  On this release she is exactly where she left off eight years ago, wonderful.  My disdain for this albumn is with the recording engineer.  Didn't he/she listen to the songs?  Eggad, have you heard of nylon strings?  The guitar screehes were shrill and although not on every song, they definitely destroyed the romantic mood one would expect from a Sade albumn.  I know the majority of reviewers are pleased with this albumn, but I really disliked everything except her singing.  I also fault the recording engineer for not dubbing down the back ground noise of the drum machine(?)and again guitar as mentioned above.  She's great, the albumn is not.  Old fans and new alike may be in awe of this albumn, but it is not my favorite Sade through no fault of her own.
0688152023|3.0|When I ordered the book I was enthusiastic. I had taken 7 years of ballet when I was younger, and now at the age of 24 thought about ballet again for the wonderful workout it can provide.  I was disappointed in the exercises as they all take place laying down.  The best part of the book was all the instructions on strengthening the abs. I noticed a difference there after just 1 week of the exercises.  A great book for beginners, although somewhat lacking in explanations.
B000001E7T|5.0|I listened to this CD for the first time 5 years ago, around when it came out.  Though i was into &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;scary&quot; music at the time, i listened to this CD and thought &quot;dear god what is this?&quot;  It was weird, it was frightening.  I wrote it off. Unfortunately.  It was just too out there for me even then.<br />Well, needless to say i have changed alot since then.  A friend of mine whose music tastes can usually be trusted nudged me in the direction of PJ, and i must say, it is fantastic.  It is dark and full of raw and writhing power.  It is twisted in a world that is hypocritical and dangerous, it makes so much sense.  It is disturbing like an toothy kiss.  I love this album now, it is introverted, extroverted, it strikes me as both sarcastic and sincere.  A journey into falling apart....and building the world together into a place of situations and ideas gone wrong.  The shadows are a good place to scream.
0684853523|5.0|I don't plan on having a future in writing, yet I loved this book. Sure, the autobiographical stuff is typical, but is somewhat interesting and it is much more casual than other autobiographies. What I loved about this book was the description of basically &quot;How to tell a good book from a bad book&quot;. I've always known those novels on stands in the grocery store are trash, but I've never gripped why exactly Hemmingway was so amazing. On Writing clarifies both of these points. My favorite line is something along the lines of... &quot;Knowing my luck, I will go to Hell, which will be a library of Danielle Steel novels&quot;. For such a mainstream author, that takes guts! In addition, the &quot;Ideal Reader&quot; theory (that whenever you write, you are writing with an ideal reader in mind who would enjoy what you are writing) is beautifully expressed. Even if you don't like writing, you should read this. When you put it down, you will feel like a smarter human being. I am guessing one who reads The Plant can't say the same.
B00004ZEQX|3.0|My rating reflects my affinity for \\"B\\" movies.  The three stars are \\"B\\" movie stars, not \\"normal\\" movie stars.  I am being a little generous since this is only my first review, and there was a very little bit of skin during the opening credits.  If I could I'd give it 2 ½ stars, but I rounded up.  If you aren't into 70's and 80's \\"B\\" movies, if you only watch \\"good\\" movies, then you can consider this movie a zero.<br />The DVD video quality is very good, and as others have mentioned, it is in wide screen format.  The audio quality is clean; however, there is poor volume control.  At times the characters are so quiet, they can not be heard; at other times the volume goes high and well past the pain threshold.  I understand this was most likely done for effect, but it is so badly done I almost wonder if it wasn't caused by an error in the transfer process, which appears to have come directly from laser disc.  As the price would suggest, there are no frills or extras with this DVD.  The movie is adequately dubbed.<br />There are the expected plot problems; in fact, the plot gets down right confused at points.  In my opinion, Fulci failed to fully utilize the creepy Librarian character.  While the gore is pretty cheesy, it was ample, and managed to make me squirm more than once.  The \\"Bat scene\\" was a laugh riot, and there is some hilarious dialogue in the film.  The husband is tasked with consoling his nervous wife saying things like, \\"This is New England, everybody has a tomb in their house\\".  Lucio Fulci nailed my childhood fears of the basement, and I believe many people will appreciate this as well.  I wish there had been more development on how Dr. Freudstein used his victim's to stay alive.  Any demonstration is notably absent though it is mentioned on the back cover, as well as once in the last 10 minutes of the movie.  This is not Lucio Fulci best work, but it had its moments, and in between the obligatory confusion, managed to scare me.  If you're a fan of the genre, then by all means, rent it.  If you are a hard core Fulci fan, and already own better titles like Zombie, then you can't beet the price of adding it to your collection.e genre, then by all means, rent it.

B000002JPA|2.0|Well this was their second album, a little improvement in the vocal department as the guy who looked like a middle aged reject from a Styx audition got the boot in favor of another younger specimen with long flowing hair. Production seems better also but the overall package is still as annoying as ever. Once again ,too silly 80's hair metal(still gets those easy redneck chicks that think they're hip) to be taken seriously as progressive rock (which some people actually believe they are). They play a lot of notes(oooh I think they went to school for this or read too many issues of Guitar Player and took it seriously or something). This stuff is mainly for mullett hairdo wearing,Camaro cruisin' 20-30 something males who are looking to replace their worn out copies of Rush -Moving Pictures (but hey that's way more intelligent than this)and Styx - Grand Illusion (also better,but alas a silly watered down Americanization of Yes)with something new,but not committed enough to make the move to King Crimson.The excuse is probably something like,&quot;they can play and they look cool and my girlfriend will probably say they're cute&quot;. Rumor has it that later in the decade this band didn't shave for a few days for a photo shoot to update (toughen)their image (5 years post Nirvana).
0399146253|2.0|Why did she bother writing Black Notice?  It's practically re-written in this book.  I want the old Kay back. The independent, self-assured, intelligent medical examiner.  Not this whiny, irrational being.  Sorry PC but I agree with other readers, you're too caught up on your popularity, trying to fulfill book writing obligations and losing creativity and you're too hook on your own AC/DC persona.
6301871944|4.0|If you want to make a good sequel, make a different film, in a different genre. »Gremlins was mainly a thriller - »Gremlins 2« is more of a comedy, really. And this is exactly what makes »Gremlins 2« much more than just a sequel!<br />The characters are the same, you know the three rules, but the scenery is different. This time, these disgusting (but entertaining) little monsters take over a high-tech building in New York. And they do so from a gene research laboratory in the sky scraper's top floor.<br />THIS is the genius of »Gremlins 2«, the best way to avoid making a sequel already doomed not to be as successful as the first film: The fact that the monsters fool around in this lab creates new possibilities to exploit! Now, the monsters come in all shapes... which does not only make »Gremlins 2« VERY funny (rather than scary) but also seals their own fate, eventually.<br />Worthwhile!
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Like the topic says, you get to see some of the best cars in the world in action. The star of the movie is a beautiful '67 Shelby GT500 Mustang. Getting to see some great chase scenes absolutly makes this movie worth while for me. The movie isn't that bad, but it has a wierd storyline, which is unrealistic, but I could careless. This movie is all about action, and theres tons of it. The DVD holds up admirably. Theres probably close to an hour of supplimental features. A Making of addon was interesting to watch, as well as some interviews with some of the various actors in the film. I was hoping it would have a little more indepth information about how some of the stunts were done, but this will have to do. Definetly anyone with a dvd player would love to get this in their Christmas stocking! :)

And this is exactly what makes »Gremlins 2« much more than just a sequel!<br />The characters are the same, you know the three rules, but the scenery is different. This time, these disgusting (but entertaining) little monsters take over a high-tech building in New York. And they do so from a gene research laboratory in the sky scraper's top floor.<br />THIS is the genius of »Gremlins 2«, the best way to avoid making a sequel already doomed not to be as successful as the first film: The fact that the monsters fool around in this lab creates new possibilities to exploit! Now, the monsters come in all shapes... which does not only make »Gremlins 2« VERY funny (rather than scary) but also seals their own fate, eventually.<br />Worthwhile!
0783227272|2.0|Superbly crafted, wonderfully acted, powerful, real, heartfelt, and impeccable. These are all adjectives that correctly describe this film. Here's a movie that had so much going for it. I really wanted to like this film. I sat down and was amazed with pleasure by some scenes and with other scenes sat in disgust and boredom. &quot;Amistad&quot; starts out with a battle scene that reminds me of another Spielberg movie, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. The opening scene is done in a way that carries all the intensity that could make it seem real. The camera sways back and forth, in a way fighthing to get the actor in frame. It's as if the camera is an extra actor in the movie. It's scenes like this, that make me have some aprreciation for this film. The screenplay by David Franzoni is done with a lot of care and does try to offer a accurate description, but it remains uneven. Some scenes aren't as well polished as other scenes. This is all due to the directing by Steven Spielberg. On the surface he may seem to be the right man for this film, after making &quot;Schindler's List&quot;, which this movie may remind some of, in it's style rather than content. The performances by Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Matthew McConaughey, Djimon Housou, Nigel Hawthorne, and Anna Paquin are wonderful to watch. But that's not the problem with this movie. The problem lies in the screenplay. The viewer switches their moods toward the film too often. One moment a scene grabs all your attention and the next one leaves you asking for more. You actually get bored with the movie. And then a great scene will appear now and then again. But after a while, you just can't take it anymore. And your left to say that you don't enjoy this movie. The problem remains it's just way too uneven! ** 1\2 out of *****
0517122707|5.0|Excellently and very intelligently written.  Hysterical and constantly entertaining.  I cannot help but be struck by many similarities to what I believe to be the best written T.V. show of all time....If John Kennedy Toole was alive today, I have to wonder if he would be writing for the Simpsons.<br />After having read numerous reviews at this site, I am also aware of what I feel to be an inaccuracy which I would like to point out to potential future readers.  Does anyone else notice that while the positive to negative reviews of this book seem to something like 5 or 10 to 1, the percentage of people that found the positive reviews helpful seems in comparison to be dramatically lower...obviously I am not drawing a logically deductive conclusion here, but it seems to me that those few who did not like the book vindictively went through and polluted the good reviews by finding them not helpful.  While certainly this is their right, I think it helpful to note this, and suggest that the book is even better than many of these reviews and percentages of reviews found helpful would suggest.  It seems like a very basic fact that not everyone will like the same books, but at the same, tearing down the work of others is immensely easier than establishing a creative work of one´s own.  This is a fantastic book; creative, intelligent, captivating, and certainly well worth the read.  Don´t let a few vindictive individuals who cannot appreciate the true depth of this novel keep you from reading it.
B000009M5E|5.0|Surely there are aspects of other Boheme recordings that one might find preferable, but it is hard to beat the sheer beauty and Italian glow offered here.  Tebaldi and Bergonzi, who performed regularly together in the 1950s and 1960s, are presented here at the height of their vocal prime.  Serafin, who conducted Callas on many occasions, conducts here with gorgeous warmth of tone so that each scene is truly touching and alive.  There are surely newer Bohemes in the catalogue but I have to admit I never tire of this recording...I suspect Puccini would have given two thumbs up!!!
B000001FY9|5.0|I decided that, rather than review individual Marley records and extol his praises over and over again, I'd do one review of his music as a whole.<br />I'm not gonna pretend to understand why Bob Marley wrote what he wrote. I haven't done any kind of study into the politics surrounding his music. What I do know is that it is some of the best music I have ever heard. I listen to all kinds of Jamican music, from dancehall to Toots &amp; the Maytals, but Bob Marley, simply put, IS reggae. His name will forever be tied to the bass-heavy, rhythm-chases-melody sounds that defines the islands.<br />This album is the absolute essential. It will give you a good idea of Marley's music once he was in his heyday. But by all means, do not simply buy this album and stop. Start from the very beginning, and listen to his early work. Early classics like &quot;Soul Rebel,&quot; &quot;Small Axe&quot; and &quot;My Cup&quot; are masterworks in their own right.<br />His later work would become more refined as he adopted the Wailers and honed his sound down a tight cohesive unit. Albums like the brilliant &quot;Exodus&quot; and &quot;Survival&quot; will forever be remembered as reggae classics. Some of my personal favorite Marley songs are &quot;Blackman Redemption,&quot; whose groove just makes my neck bob until I hurt, &quot;Screwface,&quot; and most of the songs found here on &quot;Legend.&quot;<br />Bob Marley will forever be immortalized as probably the most important reggae artist, and the best. And he certainly deserves it. This wasn't exactly a review of &quot;Legend,&quot; and it was not meant to be, because chances are, you will be satisfied no matter WHICH Marley album you choose to purchase first. This is just a great place to start.
B00004XOWM|5.0|i didnt know what to expect from this cd.  3 dollar bill yalls was on of my favorite cd's ever adn then significant other sucked bad so i didnt think it would be that good..  but i was very suprised. it is a great cd.  it is  a lot diferent than their first cd but i like it anyway..the best song by far is &quot;rollin&quot; urban asault vehicle.  and getcha groove on is wicked phat too w/ xzibit.  this cd had more thought put into it i think so thats why i like it.  if you just listen to white trash rock and heavy metal and crap like that you mihg tno like it .. well thast what i gotta say.  peace
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Scary Movie is really funny and entertaining.  What I like most about this movie is, though, the fact that this movie follows the main story line of Wes Craven's Scream.  For those who don't know, Kevin Williams, the screenplay writer of the original Scream, originally chose its title as Scary Movie.  Later they decided to change the title to Scream.  so, Scary Movie is like a twin sister of Scream.  If Scream was intense, scary, and screamy, Scary Movie shows how the same story line can be made as a hilarious comedy.  It just as entertaining and fun.
B00003CXFV|5.0|This has got to be one of the best roles that julia has ever had to play.  Julia plays an out of work mother of three who manages to worm her way into a law firm as a secetary, and starts off doing demining office work.  Erin being her usual self doesnt really fit in with the rest of the office staff, so she goes off and does her own stuff, and stumbles across an interesting case, that is to change her life for ever.  What follows is a serious film with a clever plot and a lot of humour which makes this film a must have.
B000001FRY|5.0|To truly appreciate this album, you have to take yourself back, and remember what the music scene was like prior to U2's debut release \\"BOY\\". The punk scene was still fresh, and hard rock had begun to dominate the music scene. Eddie VanHalen was a god to most aspiring guitar players.<br />I remember walking into my local record store, and my friend who worked there saying, \\"you've got to listen to this\\"! He began playing \\"I will follow\\". The first thing that struck me was the extremely unusual mix (Steve Lillywhite). It seemed more open and airy (if that's a word). No heavy kick-drum, no super-distorted-guitar etc. Admittedly, I didn't like it at first. It was such a radical departure from what I was used to. He then played \\"Out of Control\\" which at the time I seem to have liked better. \\"Trust me, just buy it\\" He said. \\"If you don't like it, I'll let you return it.\\"<br />Little did I know the impact that album would ultimately have in my life. As I took it home and listened to it over and over, I began to realize that U2 was no ordinary band. <br />The genius of The Edges guitar playing can only compared (in my opinion) to the impact that Jimmy Hendrix had on my older brothers generation. It was such a radical departure from anything that I had heard before. No super fast lead-guitar solos. Just smart melodic, droning, full guitar sounds. It sounded like so much more than a three-piece band, even when there were no overdubs. I believe the Edge literally changed the way rock guitar players look at the world.<br />Bono's unique vocal style (which we all take for granted now) was also unlike anything I had ever heard. The only thing that it slightly resembled to me was that of Jim Morrison, and I had never been a huge Doors fan. Lots of feeling, smart lyrics, subtle messages etc. A true departure from singers of the day.<br />Larry. His drums even sounded different than other bands of the day - thinner, and kind of distant - but somehow it worked. Simple little thingsthe up-beats in \\"I will Follow\\" were different than other drummers. Nothing too flashy, but solid and inventive.<br />Adams bass playing was unique as well. He didn't simply follow the chord changes an octave lower. At times he almost sounded like a frustrated guitar player who felt that four-strings weren't enough to express what he really wanted to say. Nevertheless, he was a solid partner (with Larry) that formed an incredible rhythm section. One of the things that has made U2 great, is that Larry and Adam have let U2 kind of be the Edge and Bono show. The more you listen however, the more you realize the great contributors that Larry and Adam are.<br />I truly like every song on the album. It flows kind of like the backside of Abby Road, though it's totally different. The obvious stand outs are: I Will Follow, Out of Controll, Stories for Boys, Electric Co., Twilight & A Day Without Me. Though \\"An Cat Dubh\\" is some of the best guitar work ever!<br />This album changed everything! It really is a must-own for anyone who appreciates bands that dare to break new ground.
630575067X|4.0|I saw this movie the day it was releaseed. (Had to be there all Star Wars fans were)  It was a pretty good movie but not one of the best in the Star Wars saga.  I think what threw it off the worst was Jar-Jar Binks!!  He has got to be one of the most irratating characters in entire saga, half of the time you could not unerstand what he said and he acts like a idiot.  I heard that he is going to somehow make his way to Episode II.  Personally I think that they should bring in Chewie and let him slap him around for awhile.  The 2 best scenes in this movie have got to be the Jedi duel and the pod racing scene.  The dogfight in space is alright but I still say that Return of the Jedi has the best space dogfight. You do get to see a little bit more of the Star Wars universe in this one but not much.  All and all this was a good movie but if you are not into Star Wars that much then you may not like it at all.
B00004U45G|4.0|All right, it's not Zepllin's BBC Sessions, but it still kicks! If you're a die hard Zeppeling fan, then you may you might have shed a tear at No Quarter. Great creative minds still, but man, what happened to Plant? This CD has Jimmy Paige's brilliant mind mixed with new blood and a fresh voice. If you have ever heard an interview looking back at Led Zepllelin, you hear some reference to blending of the different styles of the various musicians. Jimmy Paige did the same here, the CD has definite ties to the Zeppelin style, but it encorporates the Black Crowe style nicely. Great CD for any Zeppelin fan, or just anyone with good musical taste.
6305169187|5.0|This is one of the wildest movies I've ever seen! It has everything you would want to see: colossal action, eye-popping special effects, stirring emotion, and wicked comedy! Bruce Willis is a great actor. He should've won an Oscar for his performance. Ben Affleck is great as well. Liv Tyler, what a woman. But what's at the heart of the story is one that is very stirring: eight men willing to risk their lives &quot;For All Mankind.&quot; This is what made INDEPENDENCE DAY so awesome, it's story of Humanity united as one in a time of disaster. A science fiction film that should also be counted among the great epics of our time. I recommend this film to everybody. Trust me, you'll love it! Grade: A+.
0393316041|5.0|This book is so entertaining, so wonderfully written, and so full of inspiration that I read all 300-odd pages of it in two sittings. Each story has a character of its own, and has at least two GREAT, truly memorable lines.<br />The most redeeming quality (and there are many!) of this book is Feynman's humility. Not once does he come off as arrogant, full of himself, or even really aware of his own genius.<br />An absolutely fantastic book. I'll be reading it again.
B00003CWPR|5.0|To feel as though you are seeing through the eyes of Stanley Kubrick is an experience we can be so fortunate as to have.  The goal is to be able to put yourself there. The characters portrayed in Eyes Wide Shut have brilliantly put themselves directly into the characters they represent.  I can see Kubrick explaining to the casting director the explicit details of a Nick Nightingale background.  The lounge player with a family, a great guy but not quite upper class.  He has some trouble with the family thing so he doesn't mind being away.  This is where the casting directors make their money. Throughout the movie we are gripped with the reality of the situation taking place.  The aristcratic elegance of NYC, along with the common streets.  The color in many of the backgrounds produces a beautiful and lasting image, and the musical score may be unforgetable.  As the viewer takes on the thoughts of its reality, the principle characters baffle with dreams and reality in a touching manner.  What may be the finest underlying tone in the movie involves Kubrick's attempt to show his enlightened path towards the power of energy forming a connection.  In an interesting change of events the reality of Dr.Hartford entered Mrs.Hartford in the form of a dream at the same time.  She also saves his life in an unusual manner. These are the finer qualities of a genius.  2001, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick has entered the minds of each character ensuring us the authenticity of each and every film.  We seldom get to see perfection attained by so so many actors in one film.  To see the involvement is to see the genius.
B00003CXIY|5.0|This movie is very funny and well worth your time. I took my Mother to see this film and we laughed so hard we cried. Seriously. The jokes are pretty universal, and appeal to a wide audience. But, be forewarned this is adult humor though, and it's not for children.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Sick of teeny boppers?  Want pop music that actually shows talent?  This album's for you.  Idealistic or not, Affirmation is truly incredible.  If you love Savage Garden's debut CD and their distinctive sound, you'll love this one.  Heartfelt lyrics, hauntingly beautiful ballads, incredible drum beats, and the most amazingly smooth vocals you'll ever hear... this album has got it all.  Savage Garden puts so much emotion into their music, and it really shows.  Definitely one of my favorite CDs.
0553211374|5.0|A wonderfully clever novel. This was my first Jane Austen novel,and I wasn't disappointed - although a bit surprised that it wasn't boring as I feared. This is the story of Anne who loses her chance at first love. When she has a second chance at love with the same man,  we fear she will fail again, but Austen keeps the reader on the edge of the chair in suspense and (sometimes frustration). What a master at turning the phrase, of creating so vividly the class conflict, and the tension inherent in Victorian manners. A definitive exploration in the art of persuasion. Now I'll have to read some others, but I chose Persuasion as my first, because it got the best Amazon.com reviews. Sounds like a poor reason I know, but I was afraid that I might find Austen's work too far away from our own times to find compelling.  I need not worry.
0553208845|5.0|Don't be fooled by the title: this book isn't about Siddhartha Gotama (Buddha); although Buddha is in the book, he serves a supporting role. The star role belongs to Siddhartha, a Brahmin's son who feels empty, a need to find himself. His Brahimn priests fail to appease his insatiable craving for the answers to myriad questions. The book chronicles his journies in search of masters that can guide him to edification, to the answers of the questions that have been plaguing and haranguing his soul.  The book is written in simple sentances and uses an austere yet precise vocabulary to convey its simple message. This translation captures the simple language Hesse used in his original German edition. It is very well written and is an engaging story. We can all relate to the Siddhartha whitin all of us, the nagging spirit that questions all. We may make hasty assumptions and feel that we have the answers but after reading this book you will realize where the true answers lie...
B000050XEI|4.0|Ah, Enya, where would the planet be without you?<br />Having waited five years for a CD full of new tracks, I was mesmerised by the beauty of all the tracks. (Well, nearly all... the phrase &quot;Wild Child&quot; sounded a little too pill-popping to hear from Enya, so now I just skip that one.)<br />This new album seems to have some sort of sadness or sense of isolation to it; it is almost a desparate sound in some tracks (the enchanting &quot;Pilgrim&quot; is particularly reminiscent of this). However, the CD is by no means one of total hurt; several of the tracks - and here I refer especially to &quot;The First of Autumn&quot; and &quot;Flora's Secret&quot; - have a vigour which has been missing since &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;. With an increased emphasis on vocal work and a limited amount of layering (which makes the music less pure in places yet somehow more ethereal in others), Enya has created a work which contains her best yet. I was delighted when I first heard this CD, and I am sure any new age music fan - especially of Celtic new age - will find a similar joy and satisfaction at the music.<br />Oh, but after all that celebratory, commendatory comment, I'd best explain why it's a four rather than five star performance: 37 minutes after *five years*? That's about 40 seconds a month! Oh, well, I suppose I'd rather have a medium amount of God-given music than an anthology of garbage. I just hope we needn't wait another half a decade to get the next CD!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I'm like most people- I have all of these songs on the &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; albums.  But to have it all on one cd that I can just load in the player and faze out for an hour and a half is an absoulute blessing.  I also agree that a lot of Beatles masterpieces are missing, but I'm hoping for Beatles &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, and on and on and on until all of their top tens are packaged and remastered.  Nothing beats the original albums, since it puts the Beatles work in a coherent story and layout, but this is excellent--27 songs for the same price as 14 or 15.
B00004SCX6|5.0|First off, lets get one thing straight. Britney Spears is one of the most talented and colorful personalities of our generation, and she isn't going anywhere in a hurry! ....  Anyway, if you like Britney at all or even like pop music in general, this album will blow you away! It has some finely crafted songs like Oops, Stronger, What U See, Lucky, Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know, and my fav, Can't Make You Love Me.  Brintey's voice sounds great on all of the tracks. Although she may not have the highest voice, she still has a fabulous voice. ya hear that, she has a great voice! She is an alto, not a soprano, so don't think she is a bad singer if she can't hit the highest notes in the world ... Ever since this album came out, it has become more and more popular. Lots of my friends who orignially dismissed Britney as an ephermeral pop fad were amazed by this album, and I constatly hear rave reviews from people about the album who have the dignity not to pass judgment on Britney right away.  one track in particular (What U See is What U Get) has everyone talking, and is sure to be a hit.  Anyway, if you are even remotely considering buying this album, I strongly suggest you do. .... In conclusion, all the bad reviews on this site are just from insecure people who don't realize how sweet and talented Britney truly is. [I love this album!]
B000002KIE|5.0|A lot of people like to argue if this is the first punk album or not. Who started it? The Ramones, Iggy, or the Sex Pistols? Are the Sex Pistols even really a band, or were they just something made up, constructed and put together? Does it matter? Probably not. Actually, if they are contrived, then all the better. Since no one band created punk the Ramones / Sex Pistols argument pretty much goes out the window. The Sex Pistols were one of the first and one of the best.<br />Never Mind the Bullocks is really their only album, and that's a shame. The songs are great. Very aggressive, with all the attitude and angst you could ever hope from a punk album. Aside from the classic tunes that everyone already knows like \\"God Save The Queen\\" and \\"Anarchy In The U.K.\\" there are many great songs on this album, in fact there are no bad songs. The highlights are \\"Liar\\", \\"Bodies\\", \\"Problems\\", \\"EMI\\", and \\"Sub-mission\\". From beginning to end this album just kicks... . Johnny Rotten's snide attitude comes through in every word, and its outstanding. It's everything punk should be. Steve Jones is probably the best punk guitarist ever and Paul Cook is just a cool drummer, so to pretend that these were a bunch of no talented fools who just got up on stage screaming would be totally inaccurate. .... . These guys wrote (including Matlock on Bass) and played great songs. Not just great punk songs, but historic rock and roll. Not only did they inspire a generation of punk music, they defined the punk attitude. And that's what punk is all about, the attitude. Their influence is felt, not only in modern punk, but also throughout rock and roll, even non-punk bands like Motley Crue, Motorhead and Megadeth have covered Sex Pistols songs. .... <br />Nevermind the Bullocks is a punk rock classic, and possibly one of the most important albums ever made. The Sex Pistols are raw, harsh, nasty and abrasive. Their sense of humor is second to none and their irreverence is the standard by which all others are measured. Other punk bands may have put out more music or arguably better music but no other punk album is as import to the music as Nevermind The Bullocks. It really did change everything. It changed the way the world looked at what could be done, and it made punk rock a term that actually meant something.  This album is the real thing. And it is an album that everyone should hear. I hate to think what the modern music scene would look like if it were not for the Sex Pistols and this album.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|I read some of the critics posted on this site and I could not disagree more. This album is great, like everything christina does. She is a very talented artist and she would never get involved in a christmas CD project if she was not sure about its quality.<br />&quot;My kind of christmas&quot; is different from the other albums, since it combines pop, R&amp;B, traditional christmas carols, and even some blues. &quot;Christmas time&quot;, the first track, is a pop song with christmas bells, very fine to be listened, even if it is not christmas. &quot;Have yourself a merry little christmas&quot; e &quot;Oh Holy night&quot; are performed in their original version,with christina's powerful vocals. <br />The most surprising song in this CD is Merry Christmas, baby&quot;, featuring Dr. John. It's a blues track, which is perfect for christina, who surely appreciates good music, unlike other teen divas (did you listen to her performing At Last? Simply amazing!). <br />Perhaps, the worst track in this collection is &quot;Xtina's Xmas&quot;, since it is very repetitive and does not catch the holiday spirit. But this does not make the album worst than others.<br />If you like holiday albums, and even if you are not a fan of christina, you should give this album a try.<br />Best wishes, Rodrigo
B00000JTB2|5.0|...4 for SRV and 1 for AK<br />What a &quot;weird&quot; CD this one is! This a studio session between Stevie Ray Vaughn and the man form the old school of Blues that influenced him more than anyone else, early in his younger years, Albert King.  There is one problem though. SRV became, in all aspects, a better blues performer, better songwriter and better signer than AK, and far more famous. And by listening to this CD it will become apparent that AK is aware of all that. This recording includes 9 tracks, 8 from AK and one from SRV (you guessed right &quot;Pride 'n Joy&quot;- which to my opinion is the best version that Stevie has ever played) and a few dialogues between the two recorded in the studio. From the dialogues is easy to pick-up the mood of these two, to my ears AK sounds nervous and fake, partly due to the fact that he realized the kind of level that SRV had reached and felt that he was coming up short?. Going back to the music, SRV delivers again a magnificent performance, its easy to pick up who is who in the solos form the start, and once you done that you can't wait till AK finishes a boring, uninspired solo that drugs, so SRV can take on. Maybe part of AK' s disappointing &quot;sound&quot; is his persistence in using the V shaped Gibson, probably the most unsuitable model to play blues with, ending up with an annoying &quot;dingly&quot; sound -I doubt that this model was ever ment to be handled without 5 tones of heavy overdrive, distortion, xtortion, faz, wa-wa and phazer, that just doesn't fit in.  None the less this CD is an experience worth while for both the initiated blues afficionado and the young newcomer 'cause it grasps one of the greatest moments of Blues history
B000053VAF|5.0|Dogma has to be one of the most in-depth comedies I have seen. The Director, Kevin Smith has made a comedy that not only makes you laugh but also question what modern Religon is all about. The begining of Dogma states that you the viewer should not base your beleif in a higher bieng simply on a movie. Dogma also states in the opening sequence that people shouldn't be so serious about religon, that God has a sense of humor, look at the Platypus. This is just my opion on a movie that I have recently seen so if this helps you great, if it does not oh well.
B000050XEI|2.0|While I have always been a huge fan of Enya's beautiful music, my long wait for her 2000 release, after a gap of 5 years...ended...dare I say it?...in disappointment. Was I expecting anything different? Perhaps lovelier melodies, as heard in the timeless &quot;Storms in Africa&quot; or &quot;Faerie Tale&quot;, &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;, &quot;Ebudae&quot; &quot;On my way home&quot;.....frankly, somehing was missing. I will however mention the one notable exception to my ears: the lovely and enchanting &quot;Lazy Days&quot; , which makes you hum along instantly, in its simplicity and melodic melancholy. While people rave about Enya's &quot;New Age&quot; (I wonder what that is?) music, few people bother to acknowledge the beautiful and mystical lyrics of Roma Ryan, who is, very aptly, half Enya. Her lovely poetic talents shine briefly again in &quot;Lazy Days&quot; and &quot;Wild Child&quot;. Perhaps what ruined the mystical experience of enjoying Enya's music was the music itself...or lack of it. Though one could argue that any of these songs could be lifted out of a previous Enya album, to my ears, the music is lacking..in vibrancy...emotiveness...and the spiritual beckoning that was so blissfully present in her earlier works. Perhaps it is time for Enya to try something different...maybe use some different instruments! Having said such a mouthful, I will also venture to say that I would still buy her new music, which is, after all, infintely better than having to listen to bawling boy bands and untalented puerile pre-teens sing insipid tunes to a generation bred on MTV.
B00000J6AG|2.0|What a disappointment!  I had high hopes for this CD after I heard 'Ambient', which was my first introduction to Moby and was sonically and compositionally very satisfying.  I had downloaded some tracks from 'Play' such as 'Porcelain' and 'Down Slow' (from the big bad Napster) and was very exited about getting the entire CD. Sonically, this CD is a nuclear waste zone.  <br />This is one of the worst recorded albums I have heard since the 70's. It is as though it was done on a home computer with a Sound Blaster sound card in the basement of a suburban home (maybe it was!) or a cheap 4 track mixer onto a two track cassette deck. What a waste of wonderful, talented compositions by one of the most talented musician/composer of our times, which, unfortunately, is filled with virtual pop/techno overload.  But this is unacceptably in a period where there is such a great amount of high-resolution recording techniques and experienced recording engineers are available to all musicians. I listen with high-resolution sound reproduction equipment and expect no less from the signal encoded on the media.  <br />This recording has a vast assortment of annoying imperfections that spoil the entire listening experience.  Most of the low frequency is distorted. Some tracks have very noticeable HSSSSSSS...in the background. (I could accept this if I though it was an effect that was intended to enhance the recording in some way, but on three or four tracks?). There is also some sort of machine running in the background on several tracks that remind me of a cooling fan on a rack mounted amplifier...Ambience?  Please don't take me wrong, this is some of the most innovative music I have heard in quite some time, but lets face it, both the composition and the recording quality have to fit together to make a satisfying and truly great statement to the listening public.  <br />There is no substitute for the use of all the modern recording engineer's bag of tricks and sophisticated equipment onoffer in their studios that's specifically designed to take advantage of the wonderful digital technology available today.  I should have just kept the compressed mp3 versions and not wasted $14 on the CD because there's not much difference.
B00004SCX6|2.0|I borrowed this cd from my sister to listen to it and i did not really care for it.I thought the reason why is because i am 27 years old and not a teenybopper until i got on here and read reviews from real teenagers who disliked this album alot more than me.<br />1)Oops!...I did it again Their was always something about this song that bothered me but after reading reviews i realized what it was. Britney is singin about being a player and most importantly talking about &quot;how  she isn't that innocent at all&quot;.Britney  has been painting herself as being sweet and innocent all along.It is a bad song for little girls and teen girls to listen to.<br />2).Stronger I like the song because it has a real life meaning behind it but that's about all<br />3)Don't Go Knockin on my door I have listened to the song once or twice and i still don't like at all<br />4)I Can't Get No Satisfaction I have never heard the Rolling Stones version of this song but i have listened to this and it is not great but it's not  as bad as alot of people say it is.<br />5)Don't Let Me Be The Last to Know The song is good but her voice is so good it made me wonder if she was the one really singing it and not someone else or her voice inhanced by computers to make the song sound good<br />6).What You See Is What You Get Don't like this song at all as much as i try to<br />7).Lucky I like this song because of track #2 it has a real life meaning behind it but that's all.i think the video is alot better than the song.<br />8).One Kiss From You I like this song to some extent but could have been alot better with writing and singing.<br />9).Where are You Now This song like track #8 has potential but the writing and singing could be alot better than it was<br />10).Can't Make You Love Me I feel this song could have been stronger if it was a slow ballad, better writing and sung maybe by Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson.<br />11).When Your Eyes Say It I don't get the meaning of this song? If i understood from the lyrics what this song is suppose to be about maybe i could  have come around to liking it a little more<br />12).Dear Diary the song is ok but i think i would have like it alot more if i were between the ages of 8 to 14.This album is suppose to be mature but this song is more immature but nice try at song writing for a beginner
1567184855|1.0|I bought this book several months ago after seeing all the positive online reviews. I am *still* trying to finish it. It starts out promising, but quickly became not only disturbing and depressing, but a rather boring read. Buy at your own risk.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is one of the best films that I've seen in a long time. It has all of the criteria for a great epic film, betrayal, revenge, romance... well, not so much romance unless you have an appetite for incest as did the Prince in the film... but more importantly, the majestically depicted never tiring story of the struggle between good versus evil. Of course, there's a fair share of gore in the film, but the emotions brought on by the film far outweighs the Hollywood \\"Terminator\\" style of photography. In short, this was a film that brought my family and I to a standing ovation in front of our living room television set!!! Surely, it will do the same for you.
B000000W5L|1.0|I'm always amazed how much praise is heaped on the Stones for rehashing the same Blues/Rock/Country music formula. While it is true that some great rock bands started with this &quot;Roots Music&quot; formula, they were able to build, expand and eventually create something totally unique. Bands like Led Zeppelin, Cream and Jimi Hendrix were all great Blues bands , but had the talent and imagination to create something original and different from the standard Blues/Rock formula. The Stones, on the other hand, never had the imagination or talent to evolve from their glorified familiar 3-Chord/R&amp;B/Chuck Berry/Country songs. &quot;Exile&quot; is a good little album but it's a perfect example of the Stones inability to grow. <br />Unlike truly great creative band like the Beatles, the Door, the Who and the previously mentioned bands, the Stones are out-classed. Give a listen to any Hendrix, Beatles or Zeppelin album to hear truly groundbreaking and creative work. I like the Stones but I take them for what they are - a good bar band.
B00004VXF2|5.0|Judging from the reviews on this site, you either love this album (5 stars) or loathe it (1 star). I, of course, fall in the former of the two, but not because I enjoy listening to this album over and over...but because I appreciate the artistry and psychology that went into creating it. <br />What is music? What is noise? Music is no doubt comprised of noise, so is the inverse true? Can music (harmony, melody, etc) be found in the everyday noise of the world which surrounds day in and day out? Fans of &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; are likely to hear harmony and rhythm in the sounds of a busy freeway, while critics of this album can only find these things in their favorite Beatles tune. <br />As with all forms of art, music is subjective. The most beautiful thing about art is that it has no boundaries and no preconceived expectations, except to move us in some way. We all know art when we see it, that is how we define it personally. But to say &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; is purely noise and not music would be to restrict the very soul of its artistic construction. If you understand that, you probably like this album. <br />So give me &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;, and my favorite Beatles tune, anyday.
B000050IMG|1.0|This movie should of been rated NC-17. Because of all the sex in it. There was only a few funny parts in this movie.
0316777722|4.0|Every one of David Sedaris' books has given me moments of pure joy.  Humor like his is wonderful.  With only words, it is very difficult to be funny.  But, Sedaris does it.<br />His is a rare gift.<br />This book stands out among his others in that most of the last half deals with his encounters with French language and culture. In this group of essays, he explores various related themes -- the difficulty of being unable to master the language, feeling insecure in an unfamiliar country, etc.<br />Sedaris isn't afraid to let us know who he is.  By opening up to us, we get to see the world his way.  And find the humor in situations which he tells us about.<br />The best thing about this book is that by allowing us to see things his way, we experience something like what he tells us he dealt with in regard to French encounters.  And, this opportunity to see from a new perspective is great!<br />Keep in mind though -- this is not a boring World Cultures book of essays.  This is first rate, intelligent humor.

B000002J1S|5.0|A classic album of epic proportion.No other piece of music has ever effected me the way The Lamb has.The twisted tale of our hero Rael is accompanied by some of the most creative and intricate music ever produced. Each member of Genesis shines brightly here. Without a doubt, this is Genesis at it's height. Quite fitting that Peter Gabriel sees fit to leave after this one. How could you top such a masterpiece? You don't. Gems like this only come along once in a band's carreer and probably only once in a human lifespan. I sometimes wonder if I think too highly of this album because I discovered at a very impressionable age. It's very hard to judge that. All I know is that I see all music now in the shadow of this album. Let all who wish to string notes together refer to the Bible of progressive music... The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|This movie made fun of movies that scared some people but I'm one who would really prefer to laugh...and that is exactly what 'Scary Movie' did for me.  I laughed from about the first thirty seconds until the end and that's not to say that there weren't parts where it lagged, but what movie doesn't(besides the Matrix).  I loved Keneen's little part although Shawn's part was a little unbecoming and I think that Marlon's part could have been a little deeper.  I watched this movie twice and I was going to go back again but I couldn't afford to go three times in one week...and that is my opinion.
6304383177|5.0|Number 19 on AFI's Top 100 Comedies??  Are you joking?  This is the best screwball comedy in the history of film.  The dialogue is amazingly fast; the movie demands multiple viewings to get all of the jokes.  Of course, Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn are very nice to look at and play their parts perfectly (Hepburn's voice and LAUGH did annoy me the first time I watched it, but she grows on you).  The supporting characters are hilarious - they're all old pros, and you can tell.  Walter Catlett, who taught Hepburn slapstick timing, especially stands out as Constable Slocum.<br />Buy or rent this movie to experience the perfect screwball comedy.
B00002MZ2C|1.0|Rage Against the Machine are an absolute joke. They rail against and advocate the downfall of a system that has made them rich and famous, choosing to peddle their muddy politics to adolescents who can't even spell their name, much less carry out a revolution. This album sounds like everything else they've ever done, and Zack de la Cockroach still sounds about as menacing as a little boy with messy diapers. If they'd get off their high horse for one second and realize that music will NEVER change the world, they might have something to offer. The problem with Rage, who are thankfully defunct now, is that they have nothing to offer but destruction. That's easy- ask any punk band. A great band, like Tool, offers its fans a vision of what things could be like once the walls have been dismantled; they're far more more brutal than Rage yet constructive in their nihilism. And Zack Cucaracha, real revolutionaries don't sit on their hands and make millions- they grab a gun and go to war.
6301955595|4.0|I am giving the MOVIE 5 stars but I am giving this VHS release only 4 stars due to the fact that certin scenes were edited out for some apparent reason.  The original theatrical release was rated NC-17 but the VHS version is rated R.  The edited scenes are brief and have no affect the continuity of the movie's storyline, it is just the fact that they were edited that bothers me.

0441172717|4.0|It's not that this book doesn't have a plot. It does, and an exciting one too. It's just that the writing, the setting, the side issues, the little tidbits can obscure it easily. The first time I read this book I hated it, because I couldn't figure out what the heck was going on. I bogged down less than halfway through. Then I saw the movie (not very good as a movie, but a darned good plot synopsis for the book). Then I reread the book, now nowing where things were going, and I was able to appreciate the intricacies of Herbert's world-building without getting bogged down in it. He does have a tendancy to overdo, to make his world a little too intricate and obscure, but this is one of the perennial classic SF books with good reason.<br />As a side note, if you find yourself getting too bogged down in Herbert's prose, take a breather and go read the Lampoon's version DOON - the dessert planet. You'll howl!

B00001MXXG|5.0|I've seen this film several times before, but a friend of mine was nice enough to let me view it on dvd.  BUEllER was shot at the aspect ratio of 2.35:1, giving it an elequent appearance.  The film is hilarious with no doubt, but most tend to overlook the creative aspect of the film.  Nice editing and wonderful dramatic dialogue as well, mainly surfacing from Cameron's character.  This truely is John Hughes's masterpeice, never again has he made a film as rich and spontaneous as this.  What makes this story so effective is the fact that their's a little bit of Ferris in all of us. He is more of an idea than a character really, and it makes the film even more interesting.  John Hughe's commentary is very informative, and it sounds like he enjoys giving it.  The dvd looks marvelous, picture is excellent, but one wishes a few more extras made it to the disk.  A preview would have been nice.  All in all, FERRIS is filled with great laughs thruout, and still remains timeless after fourteen years.  HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!
B00003CXE7|1.0|You could get the same effect of watching this movie by playing Enya at full volume all the while stabbing your leg with a fork.  This movie falls way short of Braveheart by focusing too much on wooing the audience with digital effects. The soundtrack mimics Titanic by pulling at the heartstrings with cheesy vocal sonets that overlap every interesting part in the movie.  It doesn't get anymore melodramatic than Gladiator.
B000002I25|5.0|I can't say enough for this album, it was made in six days, so you can see that The Doors were masters of the music realm, I don't think I'll ever get out of the trance-formation of &quot;The End&quot; or ever lose drive on &quot;Break on Through&quot;. This album has so many different elements that work on it, you can definitely get lost in all of them. Which is how the Doors work. I would check it out, as stated elsewhere, the music isn't really lovey-dovey, it's wielded like a thunderous sword of darkness. A 10!
6304474652|5.0|After seeing &quot;Fools Rush In&quot;, I definitely feel the above caption would make for a better title. But, nonetheless, this is one of those romantic love stories with a touch of comedy and a whole lot of drama, like a soap opera, but only better. The plot centers around a consultant of an architectural firm, Alex (Matthew Perry), who, by fate, meets a single Mexican woman named Isabel (Salma Hayek). After spending the night together, Isabel becomes pregnant with Alex's child, but is quite shocked about the news at first, and isn't sure whether or not she wants to continue their relationship. As time progresses, the couple get to know each other better and Isabel introduces Alex to her family, the Fuenteses (including an angry chihuahua named Che, who, at first, displays an intense dislike for Alex, but softens up to him later), and, likewise, Isabel later meets Alex's parents. At first, their parents don't agree with the idea of Alex and Isabel going steady, because of the cultural differences of both families. But what the heck, it all makes for a very interesting, and rather potent, love story. In fact, it is a love story (as mentioned above)! Rather than saying anything further, I suggest you pick up a copy of &quot;Fools Rush In&quot;. The chihuahua alone is worth the price of this movie! Approved by the SPCA/American Humane Society and Lover's Anonymous.&quot;
0553106635|4.0|Martin writes brilliantly, and I actually broke down and bought the hardback, but I have a couple of concerns. (1) Is this going to be an interminable type series?  It is superb, but if it drags on to a dozen books, that is really too much.  5 would be OK, 4 ideal, to my mind. (2) I can't see any rhyme or reason to which character will die each chapter, or which will be miraculously brought back to life.  I supect that Martin rolls dice to decide it, and then writes the story to fit.<br />However, Martin writes so well, and brings the characters to life so magnificently, that I certainly suggest you read it.  I look forward to the next installment, but I'll buy it in paperback or share the hardback cost with friends.
B000002IP1|5.0|&quot;But Seriously...&quot; is definitely Phil Collins' best solo album, and features good pop-music material in songs like &quot;Do You Remember?&quot;, &quot;I Wish It Would Rain Down&quot;, &quot;Something Happened On The Way To Heaven&quot;, &quot;Heat On The Street&quot; and &quot;Another Day In Paradise&quot;, with the latter track emphasizing PC's humanitarian side in aiding the homeless. This side of Phil is also heard in &quot;Colours&quot;, which deals with the famine in Africa. In fact, during Collins' 1990 American Tour, which was sponsored by Sears, he donated a portion of the proceeds from his concerts to agencies and charities that support the homeless. There are also some positive, feel-good vibes generated in &quot;Hang In Long Enough&quot; and in the jazzy &quot;Saturday Night And Sunday Morning&quot;. You will find much thought-provoking insight displayed in the tracks &quot;That's Just The Way It Is&quot; and &quot;Find A Way To My Heart&quot;, with its zenith, space-age-like opening and closing. Equally touching is the heartfelt joy and melancholy side found in &quot;Father To Son&quot;. An added bonus to this CD are the wonderful musical talents of David Crosby, who sings backing vocals on &quot;Paradise&quot;, and provides some guitar work on the CD as well, and Stephen Bishop, who also sings backing vocals on this CD, as well as on other Phil Collins albums/CD's. Bishop also sang on his own hit songs &quot;On And On&quot;, &quot;Save It For A Rainy Day&quot; and &quot;It Might Be You&quot;, from the motion picture &quot;Tootsie&quot; starring Dustin Hoffman. &quot;But Seriously...&quot; is a socially conscious statement in and of itself, which makes it a must-have CD. Phil Collins would re-emerge two years later with Genesis, with what would appear to be his final album with that legendary rock group. He left Genesis in 1996 after a quarter of a century with the group. But, according to the latest news out of the Genesis camp, PC has apparently re-joined with Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford. What would be even better is if Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett joined them and harkened back to the &quot;original&quot; classic Genesis lineup. Oh, would that just make my day! Let's keep our fingers crossed, and hope all this comes to fruition. Stay Tuned!tly re-joined with Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford.

B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is both one of the finest mainstream movies and finest DVDs ever.  The action of Ben Hur and fine writing of a great epic film screenplay combined with up-to-date, understated digital technology and a wonderful ensemble cast - this film is a   visually spectacular and sonically intoxicating.  Ridley Scott manages to put the viewer in the middle of the Roman Empire the way George Lucas hurled his viewers through outer space - but with Gladiator I didn't even suspect half of what I was seeing was digitally generated background scenery and backdrops until I saw the &quot;making of&quot; featurettes on the DVD.<br />In addition to Russell Crowe's great performance, both Richard Harris (Camelot) as Marcus Aurelius and Joaquin Phoenix (Parenthood, 8mm) as Commodus, his son and heir to the empire, turn in Oscar worthy performances.  The late Oliver Reed (Oliver, Tommy) also does a wonderful job.  The costumes, the special effects, the cinematography, and the sound are something to be experienced at home, in DTS, on a good surround sound system.  <br />This 2 DVD set is PACKED with special features, including quite a few &quot;Making of&quot; featurettes and an interview with Hans Zimmer, the soundtrack composer.  <br />My only criticism of the film - and I am a Lone Ranger on this point - is the musical soundtrack to the film sounds to my ears like other soundtracks (Bram Stoker's Dracula, for instance) and classical pieces (Mars from the Planets by Gustav Holst) that have been thinly disguised and re-arranged by the composer.  I honestly don't know if this is coincidence or intentional, but only devout ST and classical music fans will notice this.  Thank God it doesn't detract from the film, and in some places the ST is quite effective.  It is a shoe-in for an Oscar nomination.  Sonically - the film is superb.<br />Congratulations to the studio on the common sense to release with several different audio options - Dolby 5.1, Dolby 6.1 EX, and DTS - all on the same DVD.  Nothing more a consumer could ask for at this or any price.  Thanks.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|While the selection of songs here can't be beat, I have to share the complaint of a previous reviewer regarding the choice of album (stereo) mixes over the original 45 (mono) versions. The latter were the ones that topped the charts, and should have been used.  Not only for the sake of historical accuracy, but because they usually sound better as well (the rhythm tracks were always more prominent in single mixes, which were intended for AM radio; on songs like &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;, the sonic difference is significant, with the mono mixes sounding more &quot;punchy&quot; and dynamic.<br />I realize that most contemporary listeners are used to stereo sound, but those versions are readily available on most of the original album CDs and the &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; compilations. So the audiophile in me is docking one star from &quot;Beatles 1&quot; for failing to use the proper mixes.<br />That complaint aside, this is a wonderful compilation and a perfect &quot;starter kit&quot; to introduce younger listeners to the Fab Four.
B00001NFCY|4.0|This is my first CD by this group but they have captured my heart. Their lyrics are as thought they are looking into my soul to see what I'm feeling and telling a story about it.

0395645662|4.0|I read The Giver by Lois Lowery. It was a good book, but very confusing. It you are a person who likes to read difficult books and like science fiction this is a book for you.  The main character is a twelve year old boy named Jonas. He lives in a town that is basically perfect where there is no pain and no color.  Jonas gets to become Reciever of Memory where he receives memory of snow, war, the ocean, ect. He is getting memories of the world before it turned perfect.  It is a very compelling story. I think it was a very good book. You might need to read it a second time to fully get it.
6305350205|1.0|Well I got the DVD as a gift from a relative who thought that it would be a welcome addition to my collection. I think not... so I come here to see what others say and what do I see... an average of 3 stars. My God, or is that just My slightly evolved being...<br />Let's go over what is wrong with this picture:<br />1. The acting; sub par and everyone can see it 2. The story; I mean there's not supposed to be spoilers here, but an implied romance between two characters, a strip scene with a 50+ year old woman. (Let's be honest here folks, I don't care how desperate you are, seeing Uhura doing a fan dance is something that gives most sane people the willies.) Spock's ½ heretofore unmentioned brother.  3. The story; Sorry, but for all of those other reviewers who thought that this was a wonderful flashback to the 60's; every character except Kirk is made a fool of. Every one. From the flying Spock, to the lost Sulu, Checkov, and Scotty, to the fan dancing Uhura. Even the Enterprise is made to be a fool. 4. The special fx; it's been covered but they are extremely cheesy.<br />What's right:  1. The music. Jerry Goldsmith is once again at the top of his game 2. The interpersonal scenes with Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Okay, even I have to admit that Shatner understood this very well, perhaps better than any of the other writers and directors of previous Star Treks. Those approximately 5 minutes of scenes worked really well for me. <br />The DVD: No real extras, and just an okay transfer.<br />The verdict: No wonder Paramount treats it's fans like dog poo... with people out there who give this movie 4 or 5 stars being the ones who go back to see the movies over and over again, there is no reason for Paramount to ever produce a decent movie or show for that matter. Please don't waste your money on this DVD.
0767853636|1.0|This is such a hideous musical.  One of the most embarrassing musicals of the 1970s should have remained there.  To keep this tripe alive, the amazing talents of director John Huston (seeing the rushes for this film must have been humiliating) Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Bernadette Peters and Tim Curry were shamefully wasted. Luckily, the lead, Aileen Quinn was never heard from again.  Little wonder!  Everything about this movie is heavy handed and &quot;creepy&quot;, from the clumsy and boorish musical numbers to the depressingly grim sets to the worst finale in musical film history. We won't even go into the tacky use of FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt for a rousing rendition of &quot;Tomorrow&quot; (a song that should have been left in a time capsule and never removed).  Some may look at this movie with dewey-eyed sentiment.  But I think many people will not be afraid to simply say &quot;This is really, really bad.&quot; To the folks at Columbia Tristar responsible for immortalizing this tripe on DVD, thanks a bunch.  Why don't you dig deeper in your film vaults?

B00004ZEQX|5.0|I love this movie! What a great transfer, the sound kind of bites but at least this classic is available on dvd. The same people behind this disc brought us &quot;Pieces&quot;, another classic in it's own right. Back to this Fulci flick, House has some great gore, a 10 on the Splatter Ladder in my books. With City of Living Dead and The Beyond on dvd now, I'm loving life. For those who don't know, the director of House, Lucio Fulci, passed away a couple of years back, his memory lives on in digital. R.I.P.
B000002J20|5.0|Make no mistake: this is Jon Anderson's masterpiece.<br />The ambition of the Topographic project may seem ridiculously high-minded -- naive, even.  (How many faiths really want a rock composer with little experience of the religion to write a vocal symphony about its core beliefs?!)<br />Before this album came out on LP, there was much rumour.  (I had it on pre-order from Simon's, a UK mail order company, when they believed it was a single-disc offering called 'Tobergraphic Oceans'.)  When it came out, the Yes bubble burst. Most critics just weren't prepared to put in the effort required to get into this record -- Yes's melodies are rarely catchy, and appreciation  usually comes with familiarity.  The New Musical Express wrote about 'Cosmic Underpants' to deride Anderson's vision.<br />For Wakeman, the album was the final straw.  Superb musician though he was, he couldn't break into the core Anderson-Howe writing team.  Though he would later write his own religious epics (several times!), he chose to return to sessioning, bizarrely for 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath', and his own solo career, already launched with 'The Sixth Wives'.<br />Alan White was no Bill Bruford.  But strangely, it doesn't matter.  For the rock fan unfamiliar with Yes, track #1 on CD2 is the best entry point, and here Alan White's drumming is more than adequate.  But really the rock fan unfamiliar with Yes should avoid this album entirely, and start with a compilation such as 'Classic Yes'.<br />In the 27 years I have owned this album, I cannot recall ever listening to this intently, giving it my 100% attention.  Life is too short not to be doing something else at the same time.  Maybe that was the problem the critics had with this album -- they needed to devote at least five hours to give it the listening it deserved.<br />But in the end, this album repays multiple listens.  Bruckner never wrote the 4th movement of his religious masterwork -- the unfinished 9th symphony.  This album is Anderson's equivalent, and all four movements are here.quivalent, and all four movements are here.
B000001ESP|5.0|I'm constantly amazed by this album.  It combines incredible musicianship with an economy of expression.  It feels like every note is there for a reason, nothing is gratuitous.  While so much music from that time period now sounds dated, this album still sounds fresh.  If you play drums you already own this album, if you play bass you already own this album, if you play guitar you already own this album.  It's impossible to provide any other band as a point of reference because there's nobody else like them.
B00001OH7V|4.0|Eno said this was really Bowie's baby and that he didn't have much to do with it, unlike Low.  But his influence can be seen throughout the album, especially the instrumental tracks on side 2.  Tony Visconti explained how they got the vocal sound on &quot;Heroes&quot; by setting up three mics at different distances with gates on them.  When Bowie let loose, the mics kicked in with a new sound.  It may be technical but on record it's amazing.  The German version from Sound and Vision is chilling.  The second side has nice instrumentals and perhaps we can say Bowie discovered New Age music, predating it's popularity by a full decade.  &quot;Moss Garden&quot; stands out as especially beautiful.  This is one of the more experimental albums and contains only one hit, but is really worth the effort.
B000021XR5|2.0|As a huge STP fan I was definitely disappointed with this album, I've tried and tried but I just can't get into it.  I've always thought of STP as a modern day LED ZEPPELIN, but this one falls quite a bit short of their 4th album!  If you're new to STP start with Purple, if you're a fan wait and hope...
B000002ADT|5.0|I already had 'Kind of Blue' and it was also a remastered edition. So why, you may ask, did I buy another one? Well, when I saw it in the music store, there was no hesitation on my part to fork out the money for it, after I read the back of the cd case. For one thing, there is an alternate take of 'Flamenco Sketches', never before released. Well that was enough there, to get me to buy. But add to that the much-improved sound. As it states on the cover, the earlier remasterings sounded thin. This reissue was remixed on an all-tube three-track machine. Now the instruments sound rich and full, like they were meant to. And finally, there was a problem with the earlier versions of this album, and that is, that 3 tunes, 'So What', 'Freddie Freeloader' and 'Blue in Green', were in the wrong key, as one of the three-track machines used to record them was running slightly slow, and the master takes used on the LP were pulled from the reels recorded on that machine, which meant that the original album and all subsequent reissues were recorded at the wrong speed, which made all the pitches slighty sharper than they should be. So this reissue now has the album sounding rich and true to life and right on key. So right there are 3 perfectly good reasons to re-buy this masterpiece even if you already own an older copy. Oh...and did I also mention the wonderful booklet packed with photos and 2 essays? One by Bill Evans and one by Robert Palmer. 'Nuff said!
B000051VWW|5.0|Thank God for Sade.  After a long absence, we have been rewarded for our patience with this lush album.  After repeated listenings at home and in the car, I have found this album to be only better after each listening.  Sade and her band have allowed this new project to be influenced--not dominated--by hip hop, gospel, jazz and reggae tones, all to wonderful effect.  The opening single, &quot;By Your Side,&quot; is an excellent blend of Sade's voice and the band's instrumentalism.  Each song afterward fails to disappont. If you don't have this CD, buy it NOW.
0395389496|5.0|I can remember being in Elementary school and our librarian reading us this book, now I am buying it for my own son!  This is truly a wonderful book and it definitely deserves that Caldecott medal.
B00003CXC7|5.0|If this isn't a Hitchcock classic then I'll start to call myself Madonna! This is my favorite movie and is a noted role to James Stewart and the fabulous Raymond Burr. I am digusted that it isn't in VHS. BUY THIS!!! IT IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!
1573226521|4.0|This book appealed to me on two levels:  as a reader, and as a traveler.  The premise sucked me in right away:  a longing for the ultimate vacation spot, the ultimate beach.  And before I knew it I was addicted to and facinated by it.  It was like nothing I had read before, and this too appealed to me.  The main character's manic trains of thought and the author's vivid style of writing were what kept me addicted.  I highly recommend this book to anyone unhappily suck in an Oprah's book club rut.  It is one of the freshest books I've read in the last few years.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|As I become more and more familiar with this band, this album continues to emerge as a personal favorite.  There is a mix of sound here which seems to epitomize Dire Straits as a band and Mark Knopfler as a guitarist.  This is a happy 'in-between' album; it presents a clear development and refinement of the self-titled debut, and it captures the brilliance of the band before they put out a few pop sucesses with &quot;Brothers in Arms.&quot;  That album is indeed a classic pop piece, but it is a significant departure from what many fans feel the band does best- that mysterious blues/rock/jazz swing that is so distinctive.  It is, by comparison, a weak album.     Here, Dire Straits fans and first-time listeners alike should find the height of what the band does best.  See the title track, a nifty rocker called &quot;Angel of Mercy,&quot; and the beautiful &quot;Portobello Belle&quot; for evidence.      In my opinion, the single must-have Dire Straits album for any serious listener.
B000009QO6|5.0|Danzig was great with the Misfits and now he is great in his own group Danzig. He is one of the all time greatest musicians and he has never created a bad song in his life. This is Glenn Danzig's first Cd is his new found metal group and they rock. He is still creating catchy tunes with his metal band like he did with the Misfits. This has to be one of my all time favorite heavy metal albums of all time. Danzig rocks and some of the best songs on this Cd are &quot; Twist of Cain &quot;, &quot; Am I Demon &quot;, and the all time classic &quot; Mother &quot;. Buy this Cd it is worth the money and danzig's other Cds are great too.
0780626966|5.0|Alright, I'll freely admit that some (alright most) of the movies in this set lacks any kind of actual plot, or direction - but who really cares? When I watch a movie, I want to be entertained, I want to escape reality and enjoy it. The experience is just plain ruined if you decide to nitpick everything that's wrong with a movie. I managed to get this set for $70 and frankly, I consider it well spent. It's the best way to escape something for hours.
6302906636|5.0|I'm not talking about the DVD when i am reviewing this movie i am talking about the original VHS non-director's cut version. This is one of the coolest movies with one of the greatest plots of all time, great acting from Lambert and Connery, great action sequences, great soundtrack which Queen rocked on, and i think it is cool the way the story can go to any point in time and it still stays well balanced. Buy the normal original version of this movies on VHS and u will be very pleased. Also check out Highlander: Endgame because it rocked when i saw it in theaters.
0525945636|4.0|GREAT SPY STORY BUT HE MISSED THE DATE OF NEIL ARMSTRONG'S MOON WALK BY A FULL YEAR.1969 NOT 1968 AS REPORTED IN THE BOOK
0399146253|2.0|As an avid Kay Scarpetta fan, I eagerly dove into this latest book.  But from the start, I found it hard to get through.  In the first place, I had not reread &quot;Black Notice&quot; recently, so I was confused about what was going on.  Secondly, so much psychobabble and introspection gets boring (and I'm a psychotherapist!).  Further, Cornwell did more telling than showing in this book and so it dragged.  Finally, it didn't quite make sense.  Tying up these &quot;loose ends&quot; didn't quite work.<br />In most of her books, the mystery is foremost, but Kay's personal life and friends/family are intimately involved.  In this one, the mystery seemed to be an afterthought and it was a stretch to tie it all in together.  We feel confusion just as Kay does;  it just isn't the same confusion.<br />Part way through, I thought maybe that &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; was a double-entendre--that this might be the last book in the series and it seemed that Kay's life was changing dramatically.  At the end, though, I'm not so sure, and, it seems, it might continue pretty much as it has been (her job, her hometown, etc.).  And, please, enough of this Loup-Garou--don't focus the next book on him.<br />Books written in the present tense are are hard to do, and, if I recall, this is a shift in tense for Cornwell;  go back to the past tense.  It works better.  Bring back the gory details of the murders, not of Kay's mind!
B00001U0DP|5.0|the first time i saw this movie i had no idea what to expect. when the movie was over, i was blown away. roberto benigni just stole my heart. it was the first movie in over 15 years that moved me like it did. i highly recomend this movie to every one.
B00001NFCY|1.0|Listening to nothing would be better than listening to such horribly derivative, bland music that Creed churns out. The first time I heard \\"With Wide Open Arms\\", I originally thought it was by Pearl Jam. This is just bland, middle of the road, average, insipid rock that makes me nauseous to know that this is stuff is popular with millions of people.
B0000013G9|5.0|This has to be one of the top 5 albums of the 90's. This album also shows the three sides to TLC: Crazy(Left Eye) Sexy (Chilli) Cool (T-Boz). <br />INTRO-LUDE This song is awesome, although it's an intro, but it has a rap by Phife from A Tribe Called Quest, and it's really good.<br />CREEP One of the big hits off of the album, this song ties in where 'Intro-lude' left off, with horns playing and T-Boz's breathy, deep &quot;oh i&quot;'s starting the song off.<br />KICK YOUR GAME Very good song, with very sexy lyrics (&quot;i been watching you/watching me/and i know you want it.&quot;)<br />DIGGIN' THE SCENE This is a good song, as all of them are. It has kind of a mellow feel to it, and i think TLC are the only people that could make the line &quot;i was chillin' with my kool-aid&quot; sound sexy.<br />CASE OF THE FAKE PEOPLE Really good song, most likely about people who only wanna be friends with them because of their money and fame. (&quot;they smile in your face/when all the time they wanna take your place/them backstabbers.&quot;)<br />CRAZYSEXYCOOL - INTERLUDE Good for an interlude, with T-Boz talkin' about &quot;the flyest kinda ... to get with in '94.&quot; Puffy is in the background, giving us a dismal 'yeah' every once in a while.<br />RED LIGHT SPECIAL Good song, probably one of the sexiest ones on the album. <br />WATERFALLS Probably TLC's biggest hit to date. If you haven't heard it, you've been living under a rock somewhere.<br />INTERMISSION-LUDE Very, very good interlude - it's just the background music to 'Intro-lude', but it's very good.<br />LET'S DO IT AGAIN Pretty good song, with T-Boz's deep, breathy vocals, and Chilli's verses only make the song better.<br />IF I WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND A remake of a Prince song, but it's probably better than the original (i haven't heard the 1st one.)<br />SEXY - INTERLUDE This isn't really a song, but more of an acted out kinda thing. It's just something you have to hear...can't really explain it much without giving away the ending.<br />TAKE OUR TIME This is probably the only song i don't really listen to that much. It's just too...slow and sappy.<br />CAN I GET A WITNESS? - INTERLUDE  This is another great interlude with Busta Rhymes.<br />SWITCH Very, very good song with the music to 'Mr. Big Stuff.&quot;<br />SUMTHIN' WICKED THIS WAY COMES Very good song, with a rap by Dre of Outkast at the beginning. TLC's vocals really shine on this track.<br />If you don't already have this album, you are musically deprived and you need it. No music collection is complete without it.
0767903854|4.0|Another excellent Bryson offering.
B000002UAR|5.0|it is better than Pepper.  I can't say why, it just is.  I love the Beatles.  Ever since I was about 7 I've been a huge fan.  The song that typifies this album is &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; because it has that sitar-like sound mixed with an upbeat tempo, the harmonies that MADE the Beatles and lyrics that suggested the path John would take in the future: &quot;When your prize possesions start to weigh you down . . .&quot; isn't too far from &quot;All you need is love.&quot;<br />Buy it, NOW!
B000050HTO|4.0|This new 2-CD collection spanning Dylan's entire career up to the present (ending with &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; from the film THE WONDER BOYS), but it gets off cheap by not filling out each CD a bit more. For instance, as other reviewers have clearly noted, one of his biggest hits and greatest songs &quot;I Want You&quot; is missing. I noticed that this was the one song from his GREATEST HITS VOL. 1 that was omitted on this collection, which makes me think that Columbia deliberately omitted it so that GHV1 wouldn't become obsolete. (Is a fully remastered back-catalog in the works?) The 2nd disc nicely fills in the gaps following Bob Dylan's debatable musical decline in the late 70's in which the hits and AOR airplay began to dry up. In short, this is a good place to start, but plan on buying several of his hopefully remastered albums in the near future.
B00003CXAY|5.0|I would echo the other reviews that sing the praises of a remarkable film and score. It's time this captivating audiovisual experience was made available on DVD, because videotape sound and picture quality doesn't do it justice. I wouldn't rank powaqatsi as highly as the original, but eagerly await the third in the series.
6305657947|5.0|This is the ultimate escapism movie.  Ir's really slick and still manage to surprise you.  Brilliant acting too.  It's funny how you think James Bond is crude after seeing the same guy play Thomas Crown.
B00004Z459|5.0|Great mix of sound rythm and lyrics, these guys are going to be on the map soon... watch for them.  Rarely does a CD come along that you like... no... LOVE every song on it, here it is.  If you like 311/Korn/LimpBizkit/etc... this is a nice sound mixture of all of them, but a copy of none.  buy it, you'll thank me.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|this is a movie about a German ship that is carrying a typewriter that the Germans where using for codes in world war 2. Usa sent a ship to steal the typerwriter but not have the Germans know. So the Americans took an old ship and made it look like one of hitlers u boats. when they were getting on the Germans noticed something and then they started shooting each other. this movie is very realistic with great affects this is a highly recomended movie.
B000050XEI|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of Enya. I own 4 of her other albums. She is one of the few artists that I will just go out and buy her album because she is a favorite of mine.<br />Many of her song on this album sound alot like many of her past songs. I was slightly disappointed. The greatest song on this album is &quot;Wild Child&quot; It is a bit different from her other songs from other albums.<br />Don't get me wrong though, when you need a CD to relax to Enya CDs are the ones to reach for!
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|this movie has got terrible reports and reviews . it isnt funny it could have been better but its not the worst. its about a killer trying to kill people . it kind of has the same story line of scream but it tries to make fun of it in the making .
020161622X|1.0|this book sat on my &quot;to read&quot; list for months and i finally picked it up based on the strength of reviews here on Amazon. what a disappointment!! the world really doesn't need another book extolling the virtues of thorough upfront design and intense testing without any specific (or even vague) plans for overcoming the traditional difficulties in realizing both those objectives. yeah yeah we know, if we dont design enough up front, we will pay in the long term anyway. enough, already. i was hoping for some creative and interesting ideas and was utterly disappointed. this book is no more than a crude compilation of half-baked ideas from any number of other similar books.<br />if you're looking for something interesting, &quot;the mythical man month&quot; is a lot better, even though its dated. &quot;inmates are running the asylum&quot; by alan cooper is also great in that it creatively and productively challenges many of the old saws that books like &quot;pragmatic programmer&quot; trot out time and time again (i particularly like Cooper's rant against letting customers dictate design decisions and product paths).
B00004X01U|5.0|This CD includes a mixed bag of &quot;Music.&quot;  Includes futuristic dance songs, pop songs and sit back and relax ballads.  The lyrics in which Madonna co-wrote on each song are unique and excellent.  I certainly appreciate an artist that writes their own music and/or has some artistic say in that.  Some of these songs have a positive message especially &quot;Gone&quot; in which she sings &quot;..nothing equals nothing.&quot;  Which is entirely ture.  While some might find this song a downturn, to me it is a work of art.  I appreciate each song on this CD and it grows on me the more I listen to it.  As of now, this is the only CD I am currently listening to.
B00003CXE6|5.0|For a while I thought the &quot;Sword and Sandal&quot; movies were over, until I saw &quot;Gladiator&quot;. The movie changed how I see great epics.  A little bloody, but after all that was the way of the world back then, right?  Ridley Scott again amazes the audience with great scenes, excellent plot, script, and acting, and dazzling special effects.  Like the movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; the main character is a man that is not normally violent, but has a killer instinct, and isn't afraid to use it, that to me, is a true man, and Maximus, is a man.
0783217048|5.0|By far, the best gay film ever produced, but also will be well liked by straight peeps.  It is a very funny movie, from beginning to end.  From the first time Snipes puts on a pump till the last &quot;Girlfriend&quot; this movie is a non-stop laugh-fest.  It had me rolling on the floor in tears.  I would highly recommend this movie over Priscilla.  That is a movie you do not need to see.  But you have to see this movie.
6305903182|2.0|High gloss, beautiful people, action, witty back talk. I thought horror movies were supposed to horrify. Same old jump out of nowhere and orchestra hits and Dolby Surround stabbing sounds with fresh faces tossing their hair around and looking cool.
B00004X0Q0|4.0|Nahh... and besides, aren't you tired of reviews that consist wholly of band chemistry comparisons, as if that took any real insight beyond that which is trivial.<br />But I digress and this album does not.  The music is hard, well-produced, and angular; the guitars pound and screech in a harmony that is both invasive and evasive, hitting an eclectic assortment of notes; the puncturing rhythm is full-bodied, if you will, with lots of stops and starts.  The vocals, while certainly reminiscent of the rantings from RATM's Zach de la Rocha, use a different sort of polish and actually deviate into song every now and then.<br />The lyrics are less didactic than RATM's, exposing little, if anything at all, on the surface level. But this band is quite political, actually, dealing with the grotesque and the horribly visceral features of life gone awry in the 20th century (and, er, the 21st century) in a method similar to that utilized by another rockin' band: Slayer.  Here, I will plainly state however that with At the Drive In the portrayal of a collective reality through a maelstrom of images and rock music functions more as a motive than it does actually manifest.  Sure, I take ATDI seriously, but they're just having too much fun, it seems, to be making such poignantly ugly and beatific statements.  Slayer (of the late 80's, early 90's to be exact) is in many ways what this band portends to be except with unlistenable guitar solos and without the pretention of genius, which ATDI seems to have and frequently lives up to.<br />The lyrics are puzzling at first.  The caustic images invoked are unrelenting, and the references - though varied, non sequitur and vague by nature - are anecdotally honest. If the lyrics were published elsewhere, they might be smeared on a wall somewhere. The shape of the lines is nonlinear, each consisting of one image, sharp and clean - like one frame of a movie (see: band name) - and is part of a horrific whole that combines riveting riffs and changes with these images, all of which has the potential to leave the listener/viewer either mesmerized or nonplussed.  (Choose the former)<br />More than any of this, ATDI is stimulating (think: a double shot of espresso).  They do appear to be having fun, and despite what I said earlier, I appreciate that. They are talented and have the right ideas about music and the world, I take one star because there are some unreconcilable gaps between the truly great songs.  This album is not a masterpiece, but it is close. It is easily one of the better albums to come out this year, and possibly the bestest, hard rockinus album of 2000, along with Automatic Midnight by Hot Snakes.
B00000J2KX|1.0|Ug. This and the other Kubrick DVDs are probably the worst DVDs produced by major studios. And considering that the Shining is one of the best horror films of all time in terms of popularity and in content quality, one would wonder why Shining would get such a crap treatment on DVD. The fact that it's fullscreen doesn't bother me because this is relatively the aspect ratio Kubrick shot the film in, it's the abyssmal picture quality the lack of supplements. The transfer Warner used here looks to be the same transfer they used for the very first VHS release around 18 years ago. The compression job is just a gasp. Even in broad daylight the compression artifacts are very apparent. I guess this is my cry for help to get Warner to re-release the movie in it's deserved Special Edition mode. I thought that this was an easy candidate for special edition treatment.
B00003CX6P|1.0|This movie was HORRIBLE!!  You know when you sit thru a movie waiting for something... anything to happen... well, you'll be waiting a LONG time w/this movie.  I was HIGHLY disappointed!  Matt Damon was spectacular as usual.  The man has a million faces and emotions.... brilliant.  However, why he chose to do a piece of trash movie as this is beyond me.  Oh and as a shocker &lt;a touch of sarcasm there&gt; Gwenyth Paltrow played a nieve, fragile, &quot;so-called&quot; victim.  PLEASE!!!!  How virtuous can one be in a scummy, sadistic, twisted plot.  Moreover... this movie lacked humor, action, drama, dynamics, characters w/depth and basically a plot.  HOW did this flick get made????  Every time I here the name ripley I shutter... what a waste of TIME!!!  I wish someone would have warned me before I sat down and wasted 120 minutes of my life... which consequently felt like an eternity!!
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd just frickin rocks period! Every song is awesome, even number 11, which everyone seems to hate. Listening to this cd, I don't think they should have used &quot;One Step Closer&quot; as their first single off the album. I think they should have used &quot;Papercut&quot; or &quot;By Myself&quot;, but either way, there isn't one bad song on this album. It's not like Limp Bizkit which you get tired of after 2 days. I have been listening to this cd forever and it's still not getting old. I can listen to the whole thing all the way through without having to skip around because every song rocks. I have a feeling this group will be around for a long time. So if I were you, I'd go get this cd and see for yourself.
0684874350|4.0|Angela's Ashes is definitely a story of a young boy who overcame many obstacles and misfortunes to fulfill his plan of making it to America. Young Frank McCourt tells his story of his Irish catholic Childhood from his early years to age nineteen. The book focuses on many issues in McCourt's life. For instance, he makes many references about the church, his inhumane poverty, Irish stereotypes, and Irish folklore. Each piece not only represents Ireland, but also effects the decisions in McCourt's childhood. The story almost immediately begins to seem depressing and sad. But, Frankie's knack for telling stories is definitely highlighted in his book Angela's Ashes. Frank McCourt gives great detail to his story which makes for some pretty sad times. His life is one with discomfort, constant hunger, an absent father and an adulterous mother who sleeps with a man to house her children. But, the story is not a tragedy, for the protagonist, Frankie, achieves his desire in the end. What makes the story a success is McCourt's progression into young adulthood. People and teens alike enjoy it because it seems more of a coming of age and a drama. I personally enjoyed it for this reason.  Angela's Ashes is a wonderful, yet sad story. Readers enjoy McCourt's style of first person narration, as well as learning about the Irish traditions. Four Stars for asngela's Ashes and a thumbs up for Mr McCourt.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Without Hugh Jackman; the actor who portrays Wolverine, this film might have fallen flat.  The sequel should be called Wolverine. This is what the audience paid to see.  The other X-Men; are just window dressing.  If a TV series is ever made with the character of Wolvie; it would not have to contain the super-hero material some non-sci-fi fans scoff at.  Concentrating on the Logan character; especially his interaction with Rogue,set this one apart from all the other adaptions of comics.
B000003S2O|5.0|An extraordinary set of atmospheres/soundscapes,and a monumental contribution to electronic music. At once soothing, and disturbing, this is a work I return to often. Defying categorization, each piece evokes a real sense of place, and I think I've been to some of these places! Brooding, dark, remote...these are adjectives that spring to mind, but the album as a whole is quite uplifting and refreshing. 'On Land' really seems to defy adequate description, but I invite intrigued readers to purchase this and listen in its entirety. The final track, 'Dunwich Beach, Autumn 1960' features Michael Brook, guitar, and is like no other piece I have heard, but I know exactly what that beach is like. Highly recommended.
6302491940|5.0|This is the movie that defined the word, 'Classic'.<br />Michael Caine plays Charlie who's just been released from prison. Rather than trying to keep on the straight and narrow, he immediately embarks on trying to steal gold bullion from the Italian's.  He gets the backing of Mr. Bridger, London's head of crime, who's in prison himself.  <br />To help him carry out the plan, he gathers together an array of colourful people including Benny Hill as the clever professor who has a penchant for big women.<br />Add to the mix three Mini Cooper's as the unlikely get away cars and you're in for a fun filled, action packed film that sees Charlie and his gang trying to outrun both the police and the Mafia.<br />The build up to the heist is interesting and funny but the unique get away at the end is the scene stealer.  Through underground sewers and subways, down church steps, through rivers and up to the very rooftops, it's gripping and highly entertaining.  I think anyone that watches the film will just yearn to have a Mini Cooper afterwards.<br />Of course, the cliff hanger of an ending just fits so perfectly too.<br />To add; I also think the soundtrack is great and the film produced one of the most, if not THE, memorable quote of all time from Michael Caine when he sees the truck explode into thousands of pieces during a practice run and then turns to the unfortunate explosives 'expert' and says, &quot;You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off.&quot;<br />Mr. Caine has said that he still has people come up to him in the street and say that to him, even now!<br />To conlcude, The Italian Job is very patriotic, even the cars are red, white and blue, and I think it's the masterpiece for all British classic's.<br />So, &quot;get your skates on, mate&quot; and buy it now - your collection is lacking if this film isn't a part of it.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park has one of the best debut albums of all time with Hybrid Theory, not the best this year (see Glassjaw) but is right there with the best albums of 2000 with Deftones White Pony, Glassjaws EYWTKAS, and (Hed)pe's Broke.  I'll just review the songs each.<br />Paper Cut- 9.5/10 A great opener for the album, heavy with some great vocals. NICE guitar work. <br />One Step Closer-  9/10  Their single and rightfully so.  It's definatly the most radio friendly song.  Again great guitar work.<br />With You- 9/10  In my opinion the most up beat song on the album. Crunchy guitar work with some cool as ice DJ work.  Their DJ is probably the best in the Nu metal genre.<br />Points of Authority- 9.5/10 Great opening and their DJ just simply shines in this song.  Nice lyrics too.<br />Crawling- 9/10 A little slower than the rest of the album, but their DJ once again adds so much atmosphere to the song.<br />Runaway- 8.5/10 Slowest song on the album, but even with that it's still very upbeat.  Again it doesn't even need to be said now but their DJ just blows everyone else away.<br />By Myself- 10/10 Screaming, rapping, singing, very impressive guitars, mind blowing DJ work what else could you ask for?<br />In the End- 9.5/10 Very rap influenced but the lyrics are so true.  The sampling fits the music perfectly.<br />A Place For My Head- 10/10 Very different than the rest of the cd.  Another rap influenced song but the lyrics and vocals are great.<br />Forgotten- 10/10 Heavy but has alot of rapping in it, the DJ work is great again.  So is the guitar.<br />Cure For the Itch- 9/10 Well he is the best DJ I've heard in a while and his song shows he knows his stuff.<br />Pushing Me Away- 9/10 A fitting end for a great cd, everything fits together.
B000021XS0|4.0|This record is excellent, just as Dream Theater could could do it. There is only one thing ,that James La'Brie has lost the aggression in his voice on this record. This was much better in their previous records. His soft singing doesn't fit the heavy playing, I think. But the music is so close to perfect as you could come, so this is just a minor critisism.I warmly recommend this record to everyone.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I'm 14, and have been listening to The Beatles...well, forever.  When I heard they'd be releasing a new greatest-hits like compilation, I eagerly rushed to the store to get my hands on it, after all, The Beatles are probably my favorite band.  Basically, I've been listening to this since the day I got it- it's wonderful.  I can listen to so many of my favorite songs without having to change the CD :)  'Let It Be', 'The Long and Winding Road', and 'Hey Jude' are just a few of the highlights on this wonderful album.  It's perfect- for the Beatles novice, to the seasoned fan.  I'm planning to buy a few copies for my new-Beatle-fan friends this holiday season :)
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I have all these tracks on other releases, but this one is still special to me. To hear these hits played together, one after the other, hammers home just how amazing this music was back then --- and still is. I agree with others who lament that a few tracks --- &quot;Please Please Me,&quot; &quot;Yes, It Is,&quot; &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and possibly &quot;Rain&quot; --- should have been included, but this is still a dynamic representation of the Beatles' mark on the hits charts. One can't go wrong with it.
0671027344|5.0|I, myself, am a freshman in high school.  (I'm nowhere as cool as Charlie, but this isn't a place for that...)  I've read this book a countless number of times, and whenever I finish it, I wish it could go on for another hundred or so pages.  Chbosky's fine and involving writing draws you into Charlie's turbulent world- to the point where you feel that *you* could be the one in the front seat of the truck, when that special song comes on and makes you feel infinite.  The Perks of Being a Wallflower takes you through Charlie's world- from starting off mourning the loss of his best friend, to his senior friends leaving for college, and all of the sex, drugs, and Rocky Horror that finds its way in the months between.  Definately one of the finest pieces of literature to find its way into the 'young adult' genre in the past 10 years or so.  Bottom line: read it.  You will not be disappointed.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is as good as the original, and while the alternate take of &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; is not dramatically different from the original, I'm not going to complain because this is my favorite track on the album, and hearing it twice in a row is like a bonus to me. A good acquisition for people who are into remasters of truly classic works of musical art; the &quot;do no harm&quot; caveat is closely observed.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|A few days ago, someone asked me what my favorite album at the moment was.  And I answered, &quot;When The Pawn&quot; by Fiona Apple.  Why?  Fiona is one of the last of the somewhat-indie girl artists who can truly still create original material, while penning incredible lyrics.  The first time I heard this album, I was 13, sitting in the dark, and thought &quot;maybe I'm not so alone after all&quot;.  'Paper Bag' is certainly the grand eclipse of this album, with Fiona's almost-jazz esque voice (reminscent of an early Joni Mitchell) singing lyrics like &quot;i know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up&quot;.  Simply put, Fiona is a girl who knows how to rock.
B00003CXE7|1.0|I bet it's a great movie, but it won't play on my new Asus DVD ROM drive which other DVD's I've rented play on just fine. This uses some &quot;PC Friendly&quot; branded software front end that my DVD couldn't negotiate, it did not see a disc in the drive. I'm looking for technical info to explain this problem so I can avoid renting or buying such DVD's in the future.
0871359448|5.0|Upon reading this incredible book again, I realized that this book is timeless. It has a style that does not require a reader to know anything about comics prior to reading this book. If you are looking to get a young person into comics this is an excellent way to start. Jim Starlin is in rare form and paints an excellent picture of angst and despair, and finally joy and astonishment. The book shows you the majestic quality of the Marvel heroes, and their epic struggle to safe guard their world against even the most impossible odds. This book displays the greatest show of courage and strength ever seen in comics. As the reader, you are given a chance to cheer, cry, and stand in total awe of all the visual magnificence dilivered in rare form by both George Perez (The Teen Titans, Avengers) and Ron Lim (X-Men 2099, Mutant X). If you want to see Marvel at its best, The Infinity Gaunlet is the best possible example.
B000006YXV|5.0|Marvin is the man, there is no doubt about it. If you're looking for some lovin' then this is the CD you need to pop in the player on those cold lonely nights and the women will flock. Many a' nights this CD has warmed my home with sweet, sweet noises. I highly, HIGHLY recomend this CD for your collection.
6304383827|2.0|I was so disappointed with this - I should declare my interest right from the start - I am a Janeite and I don't like to see people fiddling around with the divine Austen - and that is the main reason why I really don't like this movie. Bearing in mind that other's don't mind things being fiddled around with then I have to say that this movie is exceptionally pretty - the costumes and cinematography are undeniably beautiful. It is also paced well and I have probably thought it quite funny if didn't know that Austen was actually both a lot more subtle and a hell of a lot funnier. <br />Also, try as I might I just can't see Paltrow is right in the lead role of Emma. She is too skinny, and pouty - not at all the vision of Regency beauty depicted in contemporary portraits. Paltrow does do a fine job with the accent being America's favourite faux Brit-girl. But her role isn't helped by they script writers who have messed with book too much in my opinon and thus changed Emma to someone a lot more mean-minded.. <br />On the plus side I just loved the two actors who played Mr and Mrs Elton (Juliet Stevenson and Alan Cummings). They have hit the characters off to a T. Mr Weston is also pretty good as is Frank Churchill (played by Ewan McGregor)  - but couldn't they have given him a more convincing haircut?<br />Perhaps it is the nature of the script but I found Mr Woodhouse completely out of character. The subtlety of Austen's portrayal of this character in the novel is completely lost to the script writers. In her book Mr Woodhouse is an ailing invalidish sort with poor understanding - by all acccounts he should fade into the background, yet Austen allows him to dominate many scenes, with his lack of understanding, repeated comments. The ultimate in overwhelming sickness. In this filmed version Mr Woodhouse strides around manfully full of ruddy good health, but little influence - a complete turn around and he lacks the influence he holds in the book over Emma and Mr Knightley.<br />Emma is also changed in character. In the novel the subtelty of how Emma interprets events around her - and how they actually appear is almost lost. In the novel, Emma never completes anything - except the portrait of Harriet - and that is quite important to the plot.<br />The gradual build up in her frustration and that she is led astray by Frank Churchill's lack of social graces is also a necessary plot element in the novel. In this film we see quite a petulant and not particularly nice Emma right from the start - someone who is prepared to gossip meanly to Harriet about the Miss Bateses. I just didn't think a pouty, truculent portrayal of Emma was necessary - nor a rather sulky portrayal of Mr Knightly<br />As to Harriet Smith she is supposed to be stunningly beautiful. Not taking anything away from Toni Collette who I do think is very pretty - they didn't do a good job in fitting her out with flattering costumes - or hairstyles, and I don't think she rates as stunningly beautiful at all. Its quite a key point to the book really - and it was something that would have been pretty easy to do. <br />I realise, in the interest of the length of the film it is necessary to cut down scenes, and cut out elements, but very often they completely rewrote lines which altered the scene's meaning completely (Mr Elton's comments on Emma's portrait of Harriet, The first meeting of Frank Churchill and Emma, even the opening wedding scene) All unnecessary. The fact that Austen's perfect words have been read with great enjoyment for hundreds of years leaves me wondering why script writers are so determined to improve them to so little evident result.<br />If you want to see movies where Austen characters are allowed (for the most part) to speak and Look as they should I felt the Colin Firth 'Pride and Prejudice' or Amanda Root's 'Persuasion' were wonderful
B000001Y2U|5.0|This is THE marylin Manson cd to buy. It is unreal the amount of great songs on this cd. &quot; The man that you fear &quot; is one song that is ART ( what a song !). The sounds/songwriting/and words make this one of the greatest cd in the world. It is dark ..... but a good dark. There is enough rage and hate in this cd to set the world on fire.... and that exactly what it did. Manson will be one of the biggest stars in the world , just give him time. He's to talented not to be. BUY IT NOW !!!
044100590X|5.0|Dune is one of the few books I have read numerous times. The tale is believable once one allows for the place. Herbert's sense of time, ecology, heroes and the impact one has on society and the power of the human collective ego is phenomenal.<br />The new SciFi movie is much better than the original, which focused on the absurd rather than the tightly written story line.  Read the book upon which two movie have attempted to tell the immense story
B00004Z1MN|4.0|The plot of Frequency is terrific.  Everybody wants to go back and talk to loved ones that have passed on.  It would be a dream come true.  That's why this movie is so effective.  You put yourself into the shoes of the characters.  This movie makes you think a lot about things and where you are in life.  You keep saying to yourself &quot;If only I would have done that differently.&quot;  You start wondering what the effect of your past has made on the present and the future.  Frequency is a good family movie.  The characters are believable and the acting is great.  The movie is a little unbelievable at times but of course the whole premise is pretty unique.  I was afraid at the end that is was going to turn into something that we tend to see in a lot of action movies with the chase schenes and all of that.  But it didn't.  I can't say that Frequency is one of the years best movies but it does deserve a recommendation from me. 4 stars
B000002KLP|3.0|Remember the Days when Prince was Prince only, and he was showing up on non-cable TV? When the drummer \\"Dr. Matt Fink\\" wore a surgical mask while Wendy and Lisa sang backups? This CD (though Doctor Fink and Lisa collaborate only on \\"Dirty Mind\\" and \\"Head\\"; all other instruments by you-know-who-boy-wonder) hearkens back to those days of singles and (purple) roses, and is a nostalgic trip through Prince's earlier days. But, just a few years later, he would really show his range on albums that better display his compositional, instrumental, lyrical, and vocal talent.<br />Two mega-hits here: \\"Dirty Mind\\" and \\"When You were Mine\\"(the latter song even predates his Purple Majesty's use of \\"U\\" for \\"you! --we're REALLY talking nostalgia here!)  Both have Prince's usual engaging hooks (especially on such singles) and copious amounts of wonderful cheesy organ. The first is a backseat tribute to women, and the second, a slightly defiant song of heartbreak.<br />\\"Do It All Night\\" probably should have been released on another CD...it's too similar lyrically similar to the preceding songs. There's some nice rhythm guitar on the funky side in the background, though.<br />I liked the easy ballad \\"Gotta Broken Heart Again\\" more than \\"Do It.\\" Nothing exceptional, just a good, tightly constructed number.  \\"Uptown\\" is an alright funk song with synth. and Prince's falsetto wrapping around the beat.  It needed more solo guitar, but Prince focuses on the lyrics, the beat, and some interesting tempo changes. But it doesn't expand much musically and needs about 90 seconds trimmed off.<br />Prince hits his stride again with \\"Head,\\" about, well, head. He pours on the funk bass and guitar accents, and it's a more danceable, memorable song.  Prince's cries, whispers, and falsettos fill out in a funk-fest. He's a little over-indulgent on the synth., but so what? - - it's fun and tight.  \\"Sister\\" at 93 seconds is more rock than funk; some interesting dissonance but not much else.  Finally, \\"PartyUp\\" is another average effort (of course, Prince's average is at a higher level than that of his contemporary musicians!). And what are the anti-war lyrics doing here?  A mish-mosh.<br />Bottom line. . .This is a good album with three great songs but it does not show Prince's versatility. There's some good songs here, but Prince outdid this by FAR in other early albums like \\"Controversy (1981) and 1999(1982).\\"tyUp\\" is another average effort (of course, Prince's average is at a higher level than that of his contemporary musicians!).

B00003CXE7|2.0|Here's the way I see it: all movies get at least one star, because that's the lowest rating. Gladiator gets two stars: one for existing, and the other for being nice to look at. The cinematography is excellent, the CGI effects are amazing, and the action is good. The problem is, Gladiator is nothing but a loosely strung together series of money shots. The plot and dialogue fail to hold interest for more than a few minutes at a time. You can sleep through all but ten scenes or so, and you won't be missing anything.
630305904X|4.0|This film has a few things going for it. 1)Tilda Swinton-She manages to be believable as a man as well as a women and I love her direct glances into the camera. 2)The story-It may not have enough plot for some but I love the story- a person goes through 400 years of English history and changes sexes. 3)The Music- I love the last song by Jimmie Sommerville and the piano pieces are wonderful.  This is not a film for everyone. Only watch it if you have a sese of humor that looks for subtlety or you have a sense of adventure.
6305014140|4.0|In this epic anime we follow the lone ninja Jubei as he tries to destroy the leader of an evil ninja group.  The martial arts animation is incredible, the battles are spectacular.  This film includess many classic anime themes...  martial arts, demons, outrageous powers... and it remains fun throughout.  It does get graphic at times (lots of killing, some nudity, sexual situations), so this is not at all for kids.  But for the mature anime fan this is a must see!!!<br />The only reason I gave 4 stars was because of the compression of the DVD.  At times, you could easily see the gradients breaking up into separate colors, almost like stripes.  It doesn't really take much away from the movie, but it was there nonetheless.  Overall, this DVD is definitly worth seeing.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Ok, the number one issue that started to get this DVD bad reviews was that there would be no format on the Princess Mononoke disk that would allow the viewer to see the film in its original Japanese form complete with Japanese audio.  Well, guess what, it actually does.  I wish people would wait to get the FULL details about the special features of a DVD before they bad mouth it all over the internet!  It even comes with English subtitles for those who want to hear it in Japanese but still want to read along (an example of that would be me).  Next, is there too much violence in the movie or is it too weak?  The only true violent scenes are at the beginning of the movie or close to the end.  While there are much more gruesome movies, why would anyone want more?  Is that how sick society has become.  Frankly, I think there is just enough amount of violence to make this movie truely interesting (although, I wouldn't show this to young children, just to protect their own innocence).  What is this nonsense about Princess Mononoke being called a &quot;chick flick&quot;?  Yeah, sure, you can go see it with your girlfriend, but I wouldn't call it a chick flick.  I first saw it with a lot of my friends and we all loved it (for your own information, I am a guy)!  This movie is full of action, which I would think any guy would like.  The animation is amazing.  The plot is well thought out.  Plus, it's a little educational.  I learned a little about acient Japanese beliefs.  I'll admit, the English dubbing could have been better, but then, you always have the original track on the DVD.  So I bid the reader of this review &quot;Enjoy!  This is a great movie!&quot;
B00004VXF2|5.0|...but also deeply interesting. Here Lou Reed recorded guitar distortion, and the rest is history. There has probably never been a more divisive record issued by a pop star than &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;; a good number of people love it, a good number hate it, and the vast majority have never heard it. This is always going to be the destiny for this album. It is not rock music, it is barely music at all, rather an experimental aural experience. The tracks are  divided into four sections (or 'pieces' if you will) that are NOT identical, the very nature of such an experiment guarantees no logical repetition. But they are different only in literal content. Since there is no real discernible structure to these recordings, they DO sound alike if you're not closely paying attention. It's all been said here before: no melodies, no riffs, no hooks. Well, there are melodies, riffs and hooks, but they're best heard on headphones and they are fleeting (at best), and certainly they do not adhere to any accepted norms. &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; is not a cd for everyone, in fact it is for very few. Just don't expect music, though, and I think you'll find some in here. This is art, like it or not. I suspect after many close listenings that much more care and effort went into the making of this album than anyone but Reed knows. It is in all honesty an avant garde influenced experiment filtered through a contemporary classical mindset. And yes, it is quite indicative of Reed's genius, as &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; has indeed become one of the most influential and provocative albums of the rock era. All in all, I love this cd, and I still can't actually recommend it to anyone. It is THAT different.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|I'm a big fan of Marlon Wayans. Specially my favorite movies Don't be a Meanace and Senseless but this movie is stupid. Some parts are funny, maybe. The jokes are stupid, you don't even understand them. I know this movie relates to Scream 1, 2, and 3, aslo I know what you did last summer and I still know what you did last summer coz I watch them all. But at the end the movie is really stupid! ...
630575067X|4.0|Like the bulk of those out there I patiently awaited the next installment to the Star Wars Universe ever since I first learned that there were going to possibly be additional films to the original Episodes 4, 5 &amp; 6 (I think I learned about this sometime between the release of 'Empire' and 'Jedi').  I wasn't a fanatic who waited in line for days or even weeks like some, but I WAS fortunate enough to see it the day before release and as I sat through it, I couldn't help but wonder: 'What is WRONG with the critics?!  I LOVE this movie!'  I really DID.  I think the MAJOR problem that most people had with Episode I was after having waited for so long, many had come up with their OWN ideas of HOW the movie should go, so much so that by the time the movie came out there was NOTHING that could have possibly made them satisfied.<br />With that said, I DID however find one very MAJOR and GLARING error with Episode I:  From the earlier movies we discover that Obi Wan was trained as a Jedi BY YODA but for some odd reason George Lucas has decided to alter this established course by having Obi Wan trained by Qui Gon Jin.  Now while I enjoyed the character played by Liam Neeson (one of my favorite parts of the entire movie, in fact) I found that deep down I just could not find it in my heart to forgive Lucas for taking such a HUGE departure from his OWN story!  Now that being a small (but significant) complaint, I still found the movie visually stunning (how could it NOT be?) but I also feel deep down that the starships of the original trilogy were way more cool than the ones featured in Episode I (did anyone else notice that Princess Amidala's ship looked suspiciously like a silver suped-up version of the SR-71 spy plane?).  I am finding myself anxiously waiting for Episode II (due the latter part of May 2002) and I don't CARE what Lucas has in store for us, I am just excited to SEE it.
B0000062GK|5.0|Crystal Planet to me is the best Satriani album to date and my  all time personal favorite album by any artist.  The entire album is filled to the brim with mindblowing guitar work but there are two songs that really strike a chord with me &quot;Rasberry Jam Delta-V&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; are total guitar gems in my book.  If you buy only one Joe Satriani album get Crystal Planet.  Also keep an eye out for a live DVD from the Fillmore SF being released during the middle of '01.
1577311523|5.0|This book is so filled with truth, so powerful, so crystal clear that I was compelled to write this review and share it with other people. THE POWER OF NOW and WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK by Ariel and Shya Kane are the two most powerful and insightful books on self-awareness I've ever had the pleasure to read. Reading both of these books is like working with Zen masters, compassionate spiritual teachers who can free us from the torture that our minds and our judgments inflict on us constantly. I am not exaggerating when I say that THE POWER OF NOW was like a breath of fresh air. Tolle gets right to the point and explains so much about inner peace and how our minds actually work that I found myself wanting to share what he and the Kanes have discovered. If THE POWER OF NOW is the technical manual for reaching fulfillment (because it is mostly explanations about awareness rather than illustrative examples), then WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK is the practical guide with real world examples and insights that describe exactly how satisfaction is possible in everyday life. You'll want both of these books. I've found what I was looking for thanks to these wonderful authors.
B00004ZELJ|4.0|I'm really annoyed to see some of the reviews. They pointed out that the vocal of the bsb is poor. The vocal of any band n artists should not be judge through juz listening to the dvd. Maybe the problem lies on the quality of the dvd n not the artists! Anyway there is no doubt that the vocals of the BSB is the strongest and most beautiful one!Those that does not believe should listen to more music before being able to judge who vocals r weak or strong!
B00004Z459|5.0|Whenever I'm with my friend in his car, he listens to Linkin Park and I finally asked him what cd it was. He told me and when I got home I downloaded every song on Napster and the next day I went out and bought the cd. I love it--It's great!! It's def worth it!
B00003CX7L|5.0|This has GOT to be on the short list of movie sequels that are superior to the originals.  First off I felt that an entirely digitally animated movie was incredible to begin with, and when I finally saw the original 'Toy Story' I was in awe of not just how technologically incredible it was, but how GOOD it was as well.  Forget for a moment we are talking about ANIMATION...I think too many people believe that just because it wasn't live-action it simply wasn't worth an adults time.  Thank heavens I have little children who want me to take them to these kinds of films so I won't feel embarassed as an adult walking into a so-called 'Children's movie'...but it just DOESN'T matter in the case of 'Toy Story' and this particularly amazing sequel.  I have to hand it to the producers and writers for coming up with such a great story!  First off you have to put yourself into the role of a toy, and think to yourself, &quot;IF it WAS true that toys were alive, what kinds of problems might they encounter?&quot;  They certainly did come up with a plot that seems a perfect natural for this scenario.  All of the voices do a superb job of giving life to these animated toys we see, so good in fact that I watched the entire film without once thinking to myself, &quot;Hey, that's Tom Hanks and Tim Allen talking there!&quot;  You find very quickly that you are enveloped in this creative and might I add VERY FUNNY story which moves along at a great pace and well, even if you have seen it before, it is definitely worth another look...and if you have put off seeing this because its a 'kids film' get OVER it and see it.  Good stuff no matter HOW old you are.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This film is one of the greatest of it's kind.The acting is superb, particularly the brooding intensity we see in Joaquin Phoenix's Character, Commodus.He will become highly regarded and sought after as a leading and supporting man after this film..  The Dvd offers spectacular bonus features and a host of interesting deleted scenes.Ridley Scott has succeded, once again, in bedazzling moviegoers with his vision and flair for effects. This is the best movie he has directed since Blade Runner back in the 80's. He has seen to it that the DVD is as special as possible. Further, this movie is also priced quite reasonably. It could easily have been the type of new release that one could have found priced at 35.00 or more - and people would likely have paid. This is a film not to be missed.
067088278X|5.0|I hardly ever read as a child but I loved reading Each Peach Pear Plum.  This book gives children a chance to use more than just their reading skills.  Most children should already be familiar with the characters in the book and with the information they already know about the characters they can expand the story with their imaginations.  This book may help them think outside of the book and they may ask questions about why the character might be where they are and why?  This book may be very simple but it is a terrific book for young children.
B00003CWL6|4.0|American Beauty is a great movie that discovers how twisted America can be And what a beauty this is. Spacey is excellent    as Lester Burnham, a disillusioned hack writer who embarks on a reckless quest for self-discovery. While alienating his        control-freak wife (Annette Bening) and confused teenage daughter  (Thora Birch), he jumps headfirst into his midlife crisis, befriending the drug dealer next door (Wes Bentley) and lusting after his daughter's best friend (Mena Suvari), among other things. Director Mendes' uncommon approach to common realities is wonderful, and the script is full of pessimism and hilarity, with not a word wasted. Add to that the film's electric visual style, and what emerges is a terrific film about troubled souls.      Musical score is just great with along with the theme and the thoughts of Lester Cunningham (Kevin Spacey). I would recommend it for anyone to se the realities of the American Beauty
B000000I3O|5.0|Misfits are the all time greatest punk band. They have no bad songs and while they are not the most talented group they still make some of the greatest songs with the greatest beats, lyrics, guitar, bass, drums, and everything is good about them. Every song is good on this album and Glenn Danzig is one of my all time favorite singers( also rulz in Danzig ). Even though every song on this Cd rocks some of my well reccomended favorites are &quot; She &quot;, &quot; Hollywood Babylon &quot;, &quot; Earth A.D. &quot;, &quot; London Dungeon &quot;, &quot; Skulls &quot;, &quot; Where Eagles Dare &quot;, and &quot; Horror Buisness &quot;. Buy it it is one of the greatest Cds of all time and Collection II by the Misfits is right up there as well.
0312958455|4.0|As a just-retired police officer (25 yrs.) I related to Mr. Bosch.  I liked him.  Connelly has &quot;the job&quot; down pat.  He has really done his homework . . . on everything from the department shrink to the fishing trip.  He thinks like a police officer would in Bosch's situation.  Bosch was so . . . real.  This is the kind of book a cop would read and not roll her/his eyes in disbelief.<br />Thanks Mr. Connelly!
0790729628|4.0|Before director's cuts became a mainstream phenomenon and every other movie being released starting carrying that label for leaving in five extra seconds of unneeded footage, Blade Runner was rereleased as Ridley Scott's original and far superiour vision. A cult following bloomed into a not-just-cult following and fans everywhere rejoiced.<br />Blade Runner was filmed in the early eighties, before Return of the Jedi was released, and with effects that play just as well today as they did back in the heyday of the sci-fi special effects revolution. Scott's portrayal of a dark, often-raining, overcrowded LA is a thrill to watch as the scenes, blessedly free from the distracting narrative of the first theater release, pan slowly across the bizarre archetechture of the near future. The storyline is good, and gives the characters time to develop with the help of some brilliant acting, but it's the visual magic that puts Blade Runner in the much-deserved spot of &quot;Best Science Fiction Movie Ever.&quot;<br />This is one movie that should ONLY be seen in it's director's cut. Only then can you truly appreciate the dark hopelessness of the world where synthetic beings are hunted down just for trying to live. It's dirty, it's dark, it's unkind, and it needs to be seen without the studio's unwelcome brightening up and spoonfed explanations. Much better to spend your attention and energy trying to figure out whether or not Decker is a replicant, or if the rogue band of replicants can survive.<br />As has been pointed out, the DVD itself is short on extras. That's unfortunate. But maybe that's because the focus is supposed to be on the movie itself.<br />Some behind-the-scenes stuff or a good interview for the fans would have been nice, though.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Unlike &quot;the Patriot&quot;, this movie at least kept me interested during it's epic length.  While this movie is not good enough to add to my personal collection, I think it certainly earned 4 stars for pure entertainment value.  This movie had one of the strongest cast of actors I have seen in quite some time.  I also liked that it did not have a sugar-coated hollywood ending.  The only annoying thing was that some of the action scenes seemed really &quot;choppy&quot;, and were nearly impossible to see what was happening.  This is a &quot;fun&quot; movie to watch, it has a little something for everyone.
B000002O4S|4.0|this isn't the best movie soundtrack, but it's the first one i really got into. everytime i listen to it i think &quot;wow what a great movie and what a great soundtrack!&quot; remember when huey lewis was one of the judges for marty's band and he was like &quot;too loud&quot; that part gets me everytime. man--the power of love is such a great song. get this album if you like music that was made for movies but still rocks.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|Regardless of what the movie critics said, &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; was by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen with the soundtrack by Bjork the only redeeming feature.
B00003CXDF|4.0|i was dissapointed seeing mi:2 in the cinema but the 2nd time on video its a lot better. tom cruise is really cool in mi:2 and it really suits him to do action movies and he should do more of them.  the action scenes are some of the best iv'e seen and iv'e seen a lot! of action movies. john woo uses the double guns so! cool its his trademark and they make the best action 'hench' face/off.  i also hope arnie might do a john woo movie!
B0000214F2|1.0|I usually dont write reviews, but when I came across this movie I could not resist.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through.  The way this story is put forth is just way too far fetched and almost insulting.  There is a very one sided view of Patch's &quot;battle&quot; against the hospital put forth here as well.  <br />What I really dont know is how one of the previous reviewers was able to watch the movie THREE times.<br />This is pure garbage.
0440219078|4.0|Jonas's community is perfect.  Everyone knows what to do and how to help the community.  Only one person can suffer from the knowledge of the past.  That one and only person is the Giver.  He has memories of the past containing true love and all the pleasures of life.  But with this responsibility comes memories and of true pain and death.  What will happen when Jonas is selected to receive the true knowledge of pleasure and pain?    It was a good book, but it was hard to read.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction.
B00004XMVL|5.0|I did not listen to the critics. I rented this movie with an open mind and got a great thrill ride for it. I loved the concept, the crash scene was fantastic and all the acting was top notch.<br />I loved the religious Moslems, the little boy who was a girl (I thought he/she was) the bad scary but hulky gorgeous caramel crimnal and the whiny scheming antiquities dealer. The woman lead was good as so was that 'cop'.<br />I loved how three suns affected how the world itself appeared.  Glaringly hot white and then a strange sort of bluish gray. I loved the creatures, loved the machinary left behind by the previous occupants of the planet. I loved the eclipse, how those big planetary rings rose up over the horizon.<br />BUT MOSTLY I LOVED WHO SURVIVED! MY GOD THAT TOOK COURAGE! Like I said this review contains a spoiler and here it is: a boy who was really a girl, the old black moslem and the bad criminal black guy. Not a white anglo saxton protesant hetero in the whole bunch! That took guts and I applaud the screen writer to taking me there. <br />After waiting for something good to happen with &quot;Mission From Mars&quot; and nothing ever did; after be unwilling to invest my time and money into The Red Planet, Pitch Black was a fresh of visually and emotionally and scientific fresh air...
630528069X|5.0|Okay, so maybe there isn't an overflow of action movies set around Christmas...or maybe there are, but the only one really worth watching is the 1988 blockbuster, and still the original, &quot;Die Hard.&quot; It's the film that made Bruce Willis a career and John McTiernan a director.<br />New York Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) is headed to L.A. for the Christmas holiday to meet up with his wife and kids. Meeting up with his wife at her company's Christmas party at the fabulous, yet still unfinished Nakatomi Tower, where the mayhem ensues. Hans Gruber and his band of terrorists crash the party, take everyone hostage, and are ready to see their plans go smoothly, except for the one fly in the ointment....John McClane. The action picks up from there and doesn't end until the credits begin to roll.<br />&quot;Die Hard&quot; is a terrific action movie. It's got the endless amounts of bullets, the witty dialogue, the insurmountable confrontations, male bonding, and the damsel in distress that needs to be rescued. If you're looking for a classic action flick now on DVD that looks and sounds sharper than ever that will have you laughing and cheering, then get yourself a copy of &quot;Die Hard.&quot;<br />And when you're done with the first one, go and check out the sequels, which are equally entertaining. Welcome to the party, pal.
0679777547|4.0|As a passionate bibliophile, I found &quot;The Club Dumas&quot; highly entertaining and surprisingly educational. Perez-Reverte takes the reader to many exciting locations throughout Europe as his main character, book detective Lucus Corso, attempts to authenticate a rare copy of a 17th century book that instructs how to summon Lucifer himself. Corso has another challenge to authenticate a handwritten manuscript chapter of Alexander Dumas' &quot;The Three Musketeers.&quot; <br />While the plot and subplot are somewhat complex, Perez-Reverte writes in a very straightforward manner that makes the book accessible to all. As Corso digs deeper and deeper into the mysteries surrounding the two books, he meets with a variety of devilish characters determined to see him fail at his task. <br />I was very impressed with Perez-Reverte's attention to detail. He even provides bibliographic entries and sketches from &quot;The Nine Gates&quot; book. I liked these additions because while reading them, I felt like I was right by Corso's side, helping him untangle the mystery. <br />My only criticism is the weak character development. Corso lacks depth. He only has about two mannerisms that are repeated so often I got tired of hearing about them. Also, the ending was rather anti-climatic. Corso's chase for the truth is much more intriguing than the truth itself.
0812589041|5.0|This book was very well written.  It keeps you hooked from the beggining by giving you enough information to make you curious, but not enough for you to figure out what's happening.  The ending is a huge shock, that leaves you dazed and wondering like young Ender how it could have happened.  I recomend it to anyone of any age, because it is easy to follow, but interesting, and the older you are, the more you get out of it, so even adults enjoy it.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|I don't agree with much of their politics, but their musical creativity is too great for politics to matter.  And at the very least, I admire Rage for their passion and commitment to their beliefs.  It's more than anyone can say about their cheap two-bit imitators.  RATM really set the standard for the rap-rock-funk style, and they're the only ones who do it well.  Here on Amazon I see the list - \\"people who bought this also bought...\\" - and I see Limp Bizkut, Korn, Kid Rock... UGH.  What is wrong with you?  Those bands are mere poseurs... cheap imitations of a true original.  They have all the passion of a drunken frat party, all the creativity of a Las Vegas Elvis act, and all the integrity of a Jerry Springer guest.      I'm curious where Rage will go from here now that Zack is leaving the band.  I hope they don't lose the passion and energy.  Buy this CD.    I wrote that review in 2000.  It's now August 2004.  What happened to RATM without Zack?  Let's see...     On paper, if you take Rage minus Zack and add Chris Cornell from Soundgarden, you should have one great freakin band.  Instead, you have the polar opposite.  Ladies and Gentlemen: Audioslave.  I wish I was deaf.
6302878527|5.0|Stanley Donen, after making some of the most delightful musicals of the 1950s (Singin' in the Rain, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers), followed up with some of the brightest, most sophisticated comedies of the 1960s (Charade, Indiscreet, Bedazzled). Two for the Road is one of his very best, a deft and occasionally acid comedy aided immeasurably by Frederic Raphael's witty, elegantly structured screenplay. The story follows a well-heeled English couple on the verge of divorce on a motoring trip through France; through flashbacks, it follows the same couple through several previous French excursions, including their impoverished but happy honeymoon and an ill-advised journey with the husband's brainless old girlfriend, her pompous husband and their toxic brat of a daughter. The screenplay is supremely astute in depicting how love can change--and sometimes die--through the vagaries of time and human nature; but it is also supremely romantic in allowing love to triumph in the end. The film's structure is graceful and fluid, if sometimes tricky. Audrey Hepburn, that most exquisite of actresses, was never more radiant than she was here, and Albert Finney displays his bull-in-a-china-shop charm at full force. Eleanor Bron and William Daniels are a scream as the loathsome, proto-yuppie traveling companions of Hepburn and Finney.  Henry Mancini's lovely theme music and Saul Bass's imaginative title sequence add the finishing touches to a movie that is as delightfully bittersweet as a Tobler bar.
B000001ESF|5.0|In my 39 years of life I have never come across another album equal to the musical genious of rush.  I believe that 2112 is the greatest album ever produced.  As a person who is very versed in music I have strong belief that this world would not survive without music.  We need to have something to hope for,  and music is the place in the soul that hope lives.  We have a different kind of music for every mood that we're in, and in  2112 we see a young man who has been subjected to the confines of someone else's world, to live as he was told until he found something to live for in the past.  We all have that little waterfall that we would like to hide behind every now and then, and music is what conforts us there, and we all have that side of us that just want's to stand on top of a chair and tell everyone off.  So to stand in the Temple Hall and perform in front of Father Brown was the greatest triumph to this man's spirit, he believed he found something to bring joy and peace back to the people, but Father Brown thought differently.  It's just like the society that we live in today, the people who have valid dreams and goals get pushed aside by the confines of our own government.  When you close your eye's and listen with your heart to the music throughout the 2112 Overture you can't help but feel the joy, and the fear, and the loneleness and the victory of this young man.  To remember where he came from, to remember his childhood, to remember how life used to be are all dreams that each and everyone of us has.  We all long for that peace but sometimes it's not there and we want to be comforted and there's no one there. In the end when faced with the choice of living in a silent elevator music world where we all run and hide from our fears, too afraid of standing up what we believe in, or a world where you can smell the cotton candy again and climb in the trees, or listen to your music on a porch swing, to be free again.  I think we would fight tooth and nail to live in the past.  It was a peaceful time.  2112 is a magical album gives us all hope that no matter what, through it all music will never die.
B00004XONN|4.0|it's a nice album and is worth owning if your tastes vary at least a little off the mainstream, but some things need to be made clear. radiohead are not the greatest band ever. ok computer was a good album. it is definitely not the greatest album in the world ever. mogwai, the verve, teenage fanclub, primal scream and geneva all released equal if not better &quot;rock&quot; albums in the same year (1997). i still don't see how people thought it was so groundbreaking and super influential. <br />same goes for kid a. this is not such a groundbreaking/innovative/experimental album at all. the saviour of rock? oh please! the saviour of slightly off the mainstream rock? maybe. there are distinct nods to aphex twin (deliberate or not), and the electronic-laden-but-still-rock is definitely not anything new. ever heard of labradford? give them a try! they've been releasing similar but better albums for the bulk of the 90s! if you like &quot;idioteque&quot;, do yourself a favour and try out some aphex twin.<br />i don't want to keep babbling on, so i leave you with this. kid a is a really good album. leave it at that. don't overrate either it, or the band. it's not going to change music as we know it.<br />take a huge chance and risk listening to: labradford, aphex twin, mogwai, pan american, low, godspeed you black emperor!, flying saucer attack. those could start you off on a beautiful musical trip. go on, live a little. there's more to life than radiohead, although they are a good start.
B0000025DD|2.0|Were David Gilmour not a member of Pink Floyd, there's no way this album would still be in print after 22 years.  Gilmour's an excellent guitarist and a fine singer, but he has none of the songwriting vision of his former bandmate, Roger Waters.  It was Waters warped worldview that gave classic Pink Floyd its edge.  Gilmour's undeniable talent may have added to Floyd's sound, but on his own he has nothing much to say.  The songs on his debut album are mostly interchangeable.  They are also pleasent enough, but dissipate before they can make an impression on your frontal lobe.  That Gilmour could release an album of lumbering dinosuar rock in the midst of the punk explosion and not be ridiculed is some kind of testament.  But its no reason to indulge him these many years later.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Don't get me wrong this album is damn good except for the fact that you get pretty tired of the lyrics after a while.The music by Wes,Sam,Otto and Lethal is the best but Fred screwed up with the way he wrote the lyrics.Every other word in the songs is F--. I hope that in the next album Fred gets his act straight and writes some better stuff and doesn't just swear every other word.If you are new to Limp Bizkit and want to buy one of their albums buy Significant Other beacuse that is definitely better and you can't get bored with that.
B0000025ZK|2.0|Gilmour's second solo album is about as much of a snore as the later albums he would record with Pink Floyd sans Roger Waters, proving once and for all that Waters was the driving force behind the band.  Gilmour is an excellent guitarist and a decent singer, but his solo songwriting is fairly pedestrian.  Without Waters' vision, however warped it may have been, he's just another aging veteran rocker without a whole lot to say.  The same blandness that would permeate Floyd albums starting with &quot;Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; reigns here.  Ardent fans may love it, but casual fans should forget about it.
1558908358|5.0|No doubt you came here because you already like TRON. Well, enought cant be said about this masterpiece by Disney. In fact, I would call it Disney's ONLY modern masterpiece, beating out such sickeningly dated and trendy films as The Lion King. TRON exhibits all of the rare qualities that make a computer film good. <br />1) Timeless special effects. No Matrix video-game poop here. These effects were done the hard way, using b&amp;w film, color tinting, and blue-screen....NOT a silicon graphics hub and an overpaid monkey. <br />2) Illustrative plot metaphorically comparing the real world with the non-tangible &quot;virtual world&quot;. No, they are not inside the computer physically...really!<br />3) Computer as villan/hero. See Godzilla. Its a duality...its an undecidable. <br />If this review doesnt convince you, read the others. TRON is not for everyone, however. End of transmission....
B000002OX7|5.0|Need anymore be said...if you are not familiar with this album and its contributions to R&amp;R...you should be buying Kristina Aguillera's new album.
B000002J2B|4.0|One of the most overlooked Genesis albums, Wind and Wuthering is a fitting bridge between the first Phil Collins-led album A Trick of the Tail and the more familiar Genesis line-up on And Then There Were Three.  W &amp; W still offers the lofty, imaginative songs of the early Genesis albums, but one begins to spot traces of things to come.  The single, &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; is a rather sappy and uncharacteristically direct love song that seems out of place on the record. It may have foreshadowed &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot; on the next album (a much better track and far less insipid than &quot;Special Way&quot;).  W &amp; W opens with the powerful track &quot;Eleventh Earl of Mar,&quot; much like &quot;Down and Out&quot; opened And Then There Were Three.  &quot;One for the Vine&quot; and &quot;All in a Mouse's Night&quot; provides the Genesis-brand of imaginative story-telling, the latter sporting the humor that made many of the early Genesis works so enjoyable.<br />&quot;Blood on the Rooftops&quot; is a particularly wonderful ballad.  In my opinion, this track would have been a better single than &quot;Special Way.&quot;  Whereas, Tony Banks' keyboards really dominate most of this album, the drums and bass are the highlight of &quot;Rooftops,&quot; especially during the beautiful chorus. This song had a deep emotional effect on me the first few times I heard it. It's that good!<br />The album includes two instrumentals.  &quot;Wot Gorilla?&quot; isn't one of their better ones.  &quot;Unquiet for the Sleepers,&quot; on the other hand, is excellent.  It's very powerful. Steve Hackett's flawless guitar, Tony Banks' dominating keyboards, and Phil Collins' pounding drums make this track a real rollercoaster ride.  It includes riffs from the first track, bringing the album full circle as Genesis often did.  The album ends with the sad but beautiful Banks-penned ballad &quot;Afterglow,&quot; which is included on Three Sides Live.  To my knowledge, this track is the only one off W &amp; W that Genesis continued to play in later years.  The haunting vocals at the end of the studio version of &quot;Afterglow&quot; are wonderful!<br />If you have some of Genesis' later works, and enjoy the less &quot;pop&quot; tracks like &quot;Duchess,&quot; &quot;Guide Vocal,&quot; &quot;Heathaze,&quot; (off of Duke), much of And Then There Were Three, etc, give this CD a try.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  It may also prove an appealing introduction to Genesis' early works for those who may only be familiar with the more mainstream albums of the band's trio era.
B00004XONN|1.0|This album is the predictable jump to electronic texturing that has already been mastered by Aphex Twin.  Any music fanatic knows that this album is not an album at all. It should be labeled as Radiohead's experimental b-sides that dont break any new ground.  This is far more unoriginal than Ok, and too repetitive for Radiohead's true songwriting capabilities.
6304806426|1.0|Rarely have I been so bored with a movie that I sat all the way through.  Absolutely nothing happened in the movie.  But the music and cinematography were great...
B00004YA66|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I have seen a lot of what Hollywood had to offer this year and for the most part find it dull and dry. However, this movie is truly an exception! The plot is fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The relationship between father and son is heartwarming and VERY believable. The second serial killer plot is heart pounding exciting! Where many movies are over the top with sugar sweet dialogue and story, this movie offers true to life emotion. Just when you think you have the film figured out there comes the wildest plot twist! It is a extremely well done film that was sadly underrated at the box office!
B000001ESJ|5.0|This album is classic Rush. Yes, &quot;2112&quot; is as well, but to me nothing Rush has ever done represents what the band should be remembered as as &quot;A Farewell To Kings&quot;. Any one who can't get into this one is probably some bubble gum chewing blonde chick who probably can't even say such tough one syllable words as Rush anyway. The title track has my favorite Rush lyrics ever (I know, I'm a geek), and &quot;Closer To The Heart&quot; is up there to. Any musician who doesn't instantly get the desire to learn &quot;Xanadu&quot; on their guitars, basses, or drums is brain dead. Geddy's screams at the end of &quot;Cygnus&quot; were more than likely the reason he was never able to sing that high again after &quot;Hemispheres&quot;. That song is worth the price of the album alone, but this is one of those albums you have to listen to from top to bottom in one sitting. I was pleasantly surprised to see &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; on the recent live release &quot;Different Stages&quot; too. This is a must buy for even the casual Rush listener. When you get it, you can thank me later. Enjoy.
B00000K2SC|5.0|The Matrix = The Bible<br />Extraordinary special effects make the this 1999 film well known.  As the modern Lamborghini is to the Model T, so The Matrix is to movies of the past.  The Matrix is also well known for its complex plot.  In order to understand this movie, the average person must watch it twice.  Because of its complexly intriguing plot and outstanding special effects, the allusions or parallels can go unnoticed by the common person.  The Bible and the 1999 film The Matrix have incredible parallels.    The most recognizable parallels linking the Bible and the film together are the names. There are names given to people, a place, and a ship that make Biblical names.  The name of the ship the humans live on is called the Nebuchadnezzar.  This is no coincidence that Nebuchadnezzar was the name of the ship (it is not like it is a frequently used name these days).  This is the name of a king written about in the Bible.  The awkwardness of the name of this ship is the fact that king Nebuchadnezzar was an evil king in the Bible, when in the film Nebuchadnezzar is the name of the humans' ship and they are the \\"good guys.\\"  The name of the last human city in the film is called Zion, while Zion is also a Biblical city.  In this parallel, the author uses a holy city from the Bible to allude to the \\"good guys'\\" city in the film, as the Bible refers to the final city as well being Zion.  The most frequently alluded to names are the names of a few of the key characters in the film.  The most obvious parallel is the one of the key  \\"good guy\\" characters is named Trinity.  Those who consider themselves Christians would/should know that the Bible refers to The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as one called the Trinity.    In the film, two characters seem to constantly parallel two characters in the Bible.  The more noticeable character that parallels someone in the Bible is Neo.  Neo clearly parallels Jesus.  Neo is constantly called \\"the chosen one,\\" and is called, at leastonce, \\"The Savior\\" (not counting the party guy who came to him before he came out of the Matrix).  Throughout the entire film, Neo seems like the Jesus in his world.  He is the only one who can save the world, just like Jesus was the only one who could save the world in the Bible.  Towards the end of the film, Neo does things that no other human could ever do, in other words, miracles.  The word \\"miracle\\" sounds awfully familiar when one is on the subject of the Bible.  Jesus performed many miracles in the Bible, just as Neo does in the film.  Another very interesting incident in the film was when Neo, \\"the Savior,\\" comes back to life.  This is no coincidence!  Jesus did the exact same thing in the Bible.  Both Jesus and Neo died and came back to life to save the world from the enemy.   John the Baptist was the primary forerunner to Jesus in the Bible.  Many of Morphias's actions seem to allude to John the Baptist's role in the Bible.  In the film, Morphias says to Neo that he had spent his life looking for the \\"chosen one.\\"   In the same way, in the Bible, John the Baptist spent his entire life looking to find the chosen one, who was Jesus.  Morphias also stated that Neo was \\"unplugged\\" (taken out of the Matrix) to save the world.  Morphias even stated this before Neo was unplugged, just like a prophet would in the Bible.  While John the Baptist did not do anything to set Jesus free, he still preached (like Morphias did) that Jesus was the Savior that came to save the world.    A more hidden parallel in The Matrix is the incident in which the Centium Programmers (the bad guys) catch Neo.  The Centium Programmers offered to let Neo go if he agreed to work for them, and not for the good side.  This particular scene parallels an incident in the Bible when Jesus was tempted by the devil and told that if He would bow down to the devil, He could have everything in the world.  The devil wanted Jesus to work for him, just as did the Centium Programmers want Neo to work for them.
B000002IOW|3.0|Being a HUGE Rush fan, I must first state that I am an objective one as well. &quot;Presto&quot; was a hard one for me to swallow at first. The conundrum rises from the fact that, from &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; through the present, I have noticed that Rush albums went from every track being killer, to what we have from &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; on. The tracks that are good are REAL good, but the weaker tracks rear their ugly heads a little more than before. &quot;Presto&quot;, when good, is as strong as any other Rush record. But- when it's bad, it's pretty sub par. To qualify, I love &quot;Show Don't Tell&quot;, &quot;Scars&quot;, and &quot;Presto&quot;(which, by the way, has one of Lifeson's best guitar solos ever. Short, but sweet.) On the next tier is &quot;The Pass&quot; (great lyrics on this one), and &quot;Available Light&quot;. The rest I don't care for much at all. &quot;Superconductor&quot; is dull, and &quot;Hand Over Fist&quot; is the first Rush song I can honestly say I can't stand. The raw effect the band went for in lieu of the keyboard dominated material of the previous albums works for the most part, but it lacks in spots. Unlike others, I am a fan of huge production. &quot;Power Windows&quot; and &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; are perfect examples of what I consider downright exciting production. This one didn't treat me as well in the old headphones. &quot;Roll The Bones&quot; and &quot;Counterparts&quot; had their weak moments as well, but the production of both of those records sort of made up for that fact. &quot;Presto&quot;, to me, was at best a project album for a band in transition. But, the true Rush fan in me wants to speak now. It still doesn't suck. Even mediocre Rush kicks the tar out of great material from other bands. Get the album, but be warned: It's not my favorite.
B00003CXDG|1.0|C'mon John Woo, what's that ? The movie opens with a 15 minutes cheesy romance between Agent Hunt (Cruise) and Nyah (Newton), with a lot of slow-mo sequences where the two lovers look at each other in the eyes... Unbearable and absolutly not credible !  <br />Then you have the usual fight between the bad-guy-who-wants-to-kill-everyone-and-become-the-richest-man-on-the-planet and the good-guy-who-wants-to-stop-the-bad-guy. And guess what ? In the end, the good guy beats the bad guy ! Been there a 1000 times. Done that. Bought the t-shirt, thank you very much.<br />I thought that the De Palma movie sucked big time but this one is even worse. Where has the magic of the original serie gone ? Poor screenplay. Poor acting.<br />Really can't wait to see MI3, MI4 and MI12 !<br />What an incredible lost of time and money.
B00003CXDG|4.0|Looks like everyone has an opinion of MI:2 which boils down to either &quot;hate&quot; or &quot;great&quot;.  However, what about actual quality of the DVD?  For those of you who DID like the movie (and I did enjoy it) and are wondering if they should get the DVD I would say 'YES'.  Unlike so many other DVD's that are suppose to be packed with extras (*cough* X-Men *cough*) MI:2 has a nice variety of extras that I actually found interesting and enjoyable.  Especially interesting are the behind the scene looks at how they filmed the numerous action sequences (some of which were much more dangerous than some of these reviews have given the actors credit for).  The addition of the MTV skit with Ben Stiller is great.  Picture and sound quality is top notch (check out the review from 'Widescreen Review').  Despite the number of bad reviews I know people liked the film (it did gross over $200 million domestically) so for those people I say this high quality DVD is one to add to your collection.<br />BTW, I'm not dissing the X-Men movie, just the quality of extras on the 'Special Edition' DVD.  The movie is top notch and there is no question it is far better a movie than MI:2.
0440178002|5.0|This is a great book with a little bit of everything.  There is the person out of his element, politics and intrigue, romance, action... I reread this at least once a year!
0767903854|4.0|As a Canadian who's been in Australia for a couple of years now I really enjoyed this book.  Bryson captures the eccentricities of Australia and Australians very well.  The book is a very easy, light hearted read with some good laughs. The main drawback of the book is that (with a couple of exceptions) he doesn't actually make me want to see any of the places he praises -- even though I've seen a few of them myself!  He does spend far too much time in cafes and hotel rooms and not enough time talking to local people.  He also doesn't even visit many of Australia's greatest sights.  Do not read this book expecting some sort of tourism brochure. The book's success is that it manages to capture so many of the intangible aspects of Australia, and for that reason I recommend it.  If you want to get a &quot;big picture&quot; overview seen through the lens of one particularly entertaining writer, you could do a lot worse than this.  Just don't expect it to &quot;sell&quot; you on Oz.  Come down for a visit and check it out yourself.
0375703764|1.0|This book is a very contrived attempt to get the reader lost in the various levels of narritive.  While the structure of the book is interesting, and it's great fun to tell others about what you're reading, one is unable to loose oneself in Danielewski's labrynth of leaves.  It's not that the book is too complex, although for some readers this will undoubtedly and issue, but the book is needlessly complex. As a matter of fact, the idea behind the book is too push the limits of one's ability to withstand complexity and 'lose' oneself in the text.  I really cannot stress this term 'lost' too much in relation to Leaves.  In relation to this work, the term becomes some what of a double entendre, as far as the term is broadly understood, anyway.  That is, the author's intent is for the reader to get 'lost' in the book, as in to be absorbed by the book.  However, the reader becomes so innundated with tangents that they become 'lost' in the sense that they cannot remeber what is going on in the multi-layered narrative that may or may not be a 'plot' (certainly not in the strict sense of 'plot'). While 'plotless' works are the epitome of the post-modern narritive structure (i.e. Seinfeild, Mark Leyner's work), Danieleski simulataniously embraces this technique and attempts to circumvent the ubiquitous question 'what was the point?' by layering meta-narrative in Leaves like layers of rust-proffing on your grandfather's old pick-up truck.  And like your grandfather's old pick-up truck, Leaves is going to fall apart before your able to haul that last load home.
B000021Y77|5.0|I must admit that I am the kind of person who NEVER watches foreign films. However, I was convinced by others to watch this movie... thank goodness for them.<br />This movie, although shorter then most, manages to pack pure excitemnet into almost every second. The basic premise is that Lola has 20 minutes to get some money to save her boyfriend from his mobster boss. What unfolds is pure genius. However, it would be impossible to explain the concept without giving away any of the fun, so I will keep quiet. But I can guarentee that it is nothing like yo have ever seen before and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. The concept and the direction in which the movie goes is fairly ingenious and the combination of the soundtrack and the visuals makes for a fast paced roller coaster ride. Lola is as brilliant as her bright red hair and the turn of events will leave you shocked. Watch this movie, because I liked it so much, I wound up owning it. And trust me, if you like to go clubbing, you will love the music.
B00004YMVC|5.0|This is a great cd and a very interesting one at that. The reason is, as a career retrospective, the listener gets to see how Sylvian wants to revisit his past work. The song selection and order is extremely revealing and extremely tasteful. A fine cd and a great package all the way through.
B00003CXFG|1.0|People actually get PAID to make this stuff?? Bad plot, bad acting, bad directing and utterly abysmal cinematography made this movie go straight to the top of my list--of the WORST movies of all time. Not even worth the [money] to RENT, much less any price you'd pay to buy it. Too bad [I can't] assign 0 stars, that's still more than this picture deserves.
0783246641|5.0|I remember reading Ellis' &quot;American Psycho&quot; during the early 1990s.  At that time, and in my circle, only a few of us a) liked the book, b) understood its message/s, or c) identified with the characters.  When I learned of the cinematic aspirations, I was very skeptical.  Especially after finding out that the director/s were female.  I was convinced that their gender would erase some important filters which Ellis illustrated in fine literary form.  As reluctant as I was, I attended a pre-opening day screening in order to put all my worst fears to rest.  However, from the initial scene I was enthralled and impressed; almost proud of the fact that I (and a select few) had discovered this masterpiece in its purest form almost a decade earlier.  The sleek and seductive surroundings and camera angles proved to be almost as descriptive as my own imagination during that first reading.  Though, I've read countless reviews and analysis of this film, I feel compelled for the American audience to fully understand what its nature is;  what the rhetoric means, and possible states of inspiration.  O.K., most reviewers mention the comic aspects of the film/book.  From a purely characteristic perception, there is no comedy involved.  For example, Patrick Bateman (played brilliantly by Christian Bale) seemingly can't fathom a cohort attaining better looking business cards than he.  When he perceives this to happen, he goes into an obvious meltdown.  To the audience, this seems inane and comical, almost a harmless light-hearted look into the pretentiousness of the 1980s.  However, to Mr. Bateman his world is crashing down.  His ego is shattering.  And there's nothing he can do at the time except internalize his psychosis.  There's really nothing funny about that from the main character's perspective.  There isn't time or room for all of the other examples of mispercieved &quot;dark&quot; humour, so I shall continue with the meaning of Patrick Bateman's murderous rampage.  He collects bodies like sports coats, and thrives on the seedier aspects of urban life.  He doesn't walk-the-talk of the classic yuppie and is prone to manic breakdowns.  Herein lies the key to the film:  Patrick Bateman's fragile, eggshell mental state.  During the film, the successful audience member must ask himself, &quot;Has Patrick Bateman actually slashed these people in his life?  Or is he freeing himself (his mind) to do so later?&quot;  This is where Ellis truly retrieves his &quot;psycho&quot; in the title.  Viewed from this standpoint, the movie shall transcend its own platonic acetate, and the viewer can seemingly watch two movies simultaneously.  I won't allow myself to uncover too terribly much, as several readers probably haven't seen the film, but the final scene opens up many new possibilities for the main character.  This film sets a new standard in American cinematography, and to miss it can only leave a large hole in your entertainment life. In a word:  CLASSIC!
B000050XEI|4.0|There was a great temptation to use a weather pun in the title but I resisted. :)<br />I have rated this as four stars but in reality I would more give it a 3.5.  For me it loses marks because of it's length (or lack of!) and because I'm not sure I can see a progression in Enya's music with this album (something I have always seen in previous titles)<br />I have been a listener of Enya's music since 1988 (when I first saw The Celts on television).  With each album I have seen movement even within the confines of her scope of music.  <br />The Celts had a wondeful newness and raw edge.  Watermark was far more crafted and gave us the full range of Enya's music. Shepherd Moons was the most introspective and musically complex of her albums.  In The Memory of Trees (my favourite) Enya seemed to move back from over-complexity to a rounder, lighter and more complete style.<br />This time I don't see where the movement is.  The touch is light again and well polished but for the first time I don't see any newness.<br />There are some beautiful songs on this album. The sequence of Wild Child/Only Time/Tempus Vernum is excellent and Flora's Secret is wonderfully uplifting, but sadly I come away from this album feeling slightly unfulfilled.  <br />It will stay in my collection but I don't know how much I will listen to it when I have better from the artist.
0140288503|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read. This book shows that war is not just glory. It showes the bound between men in combat. I loved this book and it captured my imagination. I would recomend the book to anyone who is intersted in military history or who just wants a good book to sink thier teeth into!
B00003CWTI|5.0|PT Anderson has done it again!  After Hard Eight and Boogie Nights, he has again pulled off one of the best dramas I've seen.  The characters are real, the story is compelling and the acting is out of this world.  To anybody who likes a good story, this is your movie.  Clocking in at over 3 hours this is perfect to watch on a rainy day or cuddled up in bed at night.
B00004W510|5.0|One of the few albums I own that I would never, EVER get rid of (the others: &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, &quot;White Album&quot;, and George Harrison &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;).  Most of the cuts on this album are excellent, the remaining few are above average.  The Band shows a great musical flexability on this album; going from uptempo rock (&quot;Look Out Cleveland&quot;, &quot;Up On Cripple Creek&quot;) to ballads (&quot;Unfaithful Servant&quot;, &quot; Rockin' Chair&quot;) to country-Byrds &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; country-(&quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot;, &quot;The Night They Drove Ole Dixie Down&quot;), and everything in between.  A monumental album and definitely worthwhile to add to anyone's music collection.
6301969251|3.0|I find it amazing that this film was orginally 4 1/3 hours.  Even at it's current 3 1/3 hours, it's still too long.<br />I hate to rag on movies that protray our Lord in a good light, but...<br />While the scenery and backdrops are excellent (the scene where the Magi are following the star is breathtaking) and worthy of an epic, the movie suffers from an abundance of blandness.<br />With the exception of Charlton Heston's energetic performance as John the Baptist, and (believe it or not) Telly Savalas' very respectable and believeable protrayal of Pilate, the rest of the cast comes off flat and uninspired.  Max von Sydow's way of playing the part of Jesus comes off somewhat sterile.  The only time he seemed to display any emotion is when he was clearing out the money-changers at the Temple.<br />There were a few liberties taken with the story and plot.  Not enough to call it irreverent or anything, but definately annoying.  The most egregious one was Judas killing himself by falling into the fire on the Temple's altar.  Excuse me, but Judas died by hanging himself.  Or were the writers absent from Sunday School that day?<br />As mentioned, Charlton Heston put in the most memorable performance of the movie as John the Baptist, and, at least to me, is most in line with how I think the real John actually was.<br />As far as the cameos go, the only ones I recognized were (I wasn't even born when this film was released) Pat Boone, Sidney Poitier, and of course, John Wayne, whose delivery of his single line was flatter than Kansas in the wintertime.<br />Overall, this is a decent picture, but certainly not on the scale of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; or even &quot;King of Kings&quot;.  However, I will catch it again the next time it's on AMC and see if it is any better the 2nd time around.
B000002518|5.0|Odd how many of the collection-fillers purchased recently have been from the mid-1970's.  One thing about really good music is that it is not tied tightly to a particular time.  My vinyl record (remember those?) is one big scratch at this point, so it was time for a CD.<br />Peckinpah's film is infamous in its own way for showing up at different theaters in different versions - quite literally edited with different scenes in different places.  Now this has settled to a director's cut (103 minutes with everything in the order Sam Peckinpah wanted), a chopped and sanitzed version for broadcast, and the random versions still floating around of alternative cuttings.  So it was left to Bob Dylan, along with Byron Berline and Sundance, to provide a consistent and thematic assurance to the audiences of varying versions.  In Berline's &quot;Turkey Run&quot;, the music tells you the gang is racing around on horses, chasing wild turkeys.  In the hit &quot;Knockin' On Heaven's Door&quot; one knows there is a noble death impending; on the screen this understated scene is amplified mightily in emotional impact by Dylan's song.  Even the recurrent simple guitar riffs are pleasant.  <br />This is also one of the great rush-hour albums.  Pop it on during that horrendous hour-long commute on the 405, and spend the time on a dusty ranch in the Old West; the gritty and realistic old West as portrayed in the film.  Good schtuff!
B000002WPI|5.0|A friend of mine recently told me &quot;If you have their first, you have their best.&quot;  True enough, Enter the Wu Tang is their best album as a whole.  The others are good too, but this one stands out.  <br />There is just something about the &quot;Wu Tang Style&quot; that grabs me.  The inclusion of dubbed movie clips, the raw beats and gruff vocals... RZA really knows what he's doing.  <br />Some might think that they aren't as interesting as the &quot;Jigga Who/Bling Bling/Back That Thang Up&quot; noise that is being passed off as rap these days.  I say the Wu Tang Clan are more interesting and more credible than all of those acts combined.  So if you havent already, check out the Wu Tang Clan.  This is the place to start.  And if you like what you hear, check out their solo albums as well.
B00003CXIY|5.0|Ok this movie is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. If u liked American Pie I guarantee u, that u will like this movie. I'm 14 and my friend and I went to see this movie not sure what to expect, we came out of the theatre asking when it would be out on video so we could watch it again again.  If your in the mood for a laugh out loud comedy, buy this movie.
B00003CX8I|4.0|My husband is a huge X-Men fan, so when a local video store put the movie out to rent a few days before you could buy it, he snapped it up and brought it home. We had already seen it in the theater, and I thoroughly enjoyed the film itself, but the rental copy was plagued by sound problems which made the bass much louder than the treble and rendered much of the dialogue unintelligible. Be cautious, because other copies with this problem may be out there. The tape that we bought for our own collection, however, has no sound problems, so the defect is apparently not universal.
B000003CMC|5.0|A great album on all levels.  If this one isn't in your collection, it should be.  I still get chills when I pop this one in and &quot;Ain't Wasting Time No More&quot; comes on.  Sounds fresh as the day it was recorded.  The album is actually a mix of stuido and live material (recorded at the Fillmore East), and each provide their own unique rewards.  The playing is phenomenal, and the songs are beautiful.  Duane Allman, one of the great slide players, is featured mostly on the live material, with the exception of &quot;Blue Sky&quot; (YES!!) and &quot;Little Martha&quot; (a sweet 2-guitar instrumental with Dicky Betts).  The live material, where the Allman's really opened it up, has the feel of improvisational jazz (not surprising, as Duane was listening to Miles' &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; at the time).  Throw in the laid-back &quot;Melissa&quot; and what else can you say.  Even the artwork by Jim Flournoy Holmes and W. David Powell is classic.  Folks, they don't make many like this, and when they do, we can just sit back, listen, and be forever grateful.
B000050XEI|1.0|This album was vintage Enya - no breakthrough here.  While Ishould have waited and ordered it through Amazon, I was hasty and paid(much more) at a local store.  The jacket revealed no data on the length, so I was shocked to learn after playing it that it is only 34 minutes long! Who in this day and age cuts cds as short as this!  It was like listening to a 45 RPM.  What a ripoff - don,t waste your money.
B00004STPT|5.0|The soundtrack is one of the finest movie soundtracks ever.  Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard created a fine variety of music, from the adrenaline-packed battle pieces to the wistful, homesick songs, each linked to the other with the melodic theme.  A definite must-buy.
B000003CKH|5.0|hi, i very like this album and i want to know about  lyrics and kord in this album so please give me information about that thanks
B0000507R2|3.0|Well the music gets 4 stars since Tigerlily was already a classic album before this release. Like what some of you have mentioned, this format has a contradictory name Digital VIDEO disc (DVD)-audio. Basically, just static images plus on-screen lyrics but no actual videos. What the record company should have done to make this format better (besides the obvious improvement in sound quality) is to include all the videos from this record. This is one of the emerging new techniques/technologies in digital music, Sony has unveiled several catalog titles under its new technology Super Audio CD (SACD) which reproduces digital sound at even higher rates. Like DVD-audio, there's no videos, not even images yet, although the SACD can hold up to 8X more info, including video in addition to sounds and images. But as both these two formats cost the price of a DVD and require either the DVD player or the super-expensive SACD player (which plays CD and DVD), it's definitely not worth it. Besides, there may not emerge to be popular formats as yet. Even the DVD is not up for mass adoption yet.
B0000026DJ|5.0|Midnight Oil are one of the most politically conscious bands in rock, singing about the political climate in their native Australia.  In fact, lead singer Peter Garrett was an elected member of his country's government.  Diesel &amp; Dust was their breakthrough album in the US and it spurred on by the driving single and lead track &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot;.  That song, propelled by its powerful horn section, is about the plight of the Aboriginal people of their homeland.  The other nine tracks all take on some sort of political bent.  They show that one can make good music, make a statement and not come off as preachy or pretentious.  &quot;Put Down That Weapon&quot; is a track that simmers along while &quot;Dreamworld&quot; is a frenetic rocker.  &quot;Whoah&quot; &amp; &quot;Bullroarer&quot; are calls for change.  The album's centerpiece and one of the best songs to be released in the last twenty years is &quot;The Dead Heart&quot;.  The song has a majestical sound with kettledrums pounding through and a riveting doo-doo chorus, it is an unforgettable and powerful song.  Midnight Oil sings about subjects that we in America may not fully understand, but they convey the true power that music can be, because you find yourself pausing to think and hoping for change.
0399143904|5.0|After the very good series of books about Jack Ryan, I didn't think Tom Clancy had it in him to produce something different on the same level. He just proved me wrong. This one is GOOD. It has all the right elements of suspense. There are few enough casualties, so that it looks (barely) believable, but doesn't depress. The good guys win, of course. International terrorism (and this time the arch-villain is, believe it or not, an American !) is defeated once again. The world is saved by the efforts of a few good people, with Clancy, Clark and Chavez orchestrating it all.
B000001E7T|4.0|PJ Harvey came into her own of her third release, the guttural To Bring You My Love.  The title track starts the album off with a reverberated, fuzz guitar attack that sets the tone for the album.  It is a personal, fierce song and is brilliant. &quot;Meet Ze Monster&quot; follows with the same piercing effect.  &quot;C'mon Billy&quot; and &quot;Long Snake Moan&quot; are top-notch tracks as well.  Ms. Harvey summons up the ghosts of Marianne Faithful &amp; Patti Smith with deeply personal and feral songs that rage with an underbelly of understanding &amp; softness.
B00001O2GN|4.0|ROBOCOP is now available in a DVD BOX set.YES all three. All movies are presented in DOBLY DIGITAL STEREO(NOT SURROUND,Or 5.1). With some Discrete Audio Sound on rear speakers. Robocop 1,2,and 3 are Presented in a 1.85 (NON ANAPMORPHIC) MATTED Widescreen,The Way the movies was presented in Theaters.Actualy ROBOCOP is original prints is 1.66 as shown on the CRITERION Edition,The original Aspect Ratio. It Contains Chapter Search and Animated Menus, and noting more. NO TRAILERS,Image gallery nore a Making Of.Even the Criterion doesent. But I know this Box set is a Collectors Item since ORION is now called MGM.And they should make a Special EDITION box set because ROBOCOP does have deleted scenes and I know that personally.Also ROBOCOP need to be presented in a 5.1 EX surround instead of STEREO Suround,ED-209's &quot;Whump&quot; has no bass. ROBOCOP WILL ALWAYS LIVE AS A TV SERIES AFTER THE LAST 2 FAILURE MOVIES.ROBOCOP 1 WILL REMAIN THE BEST.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I have been a Creed fan for a long while but I just got the CD. I love there music so much! You can not help but feel their songs. My favorite on the CD is track 9 &quot;Higher&quot;. Now that song is one for the record books, it is that good. Now do not get me wrong the whole CD is good. Some other songs I like on this album are tracks 1,3,8, and 11. This is a definite must buy!
0380018179|5.0|Colleen McCullough certainly knows how to weave an exceptional and intricate story of a true but frustrating love; in this instance we read about a classic example of the torture and tragedy two people have to endure due to the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church.  This is a very telling tale, and the reader needs to look beyond the physical and emotional attraction between Father Ralph and Megan and straight into a stiff-necked Roman institution that prevents normal men from expressing themselves sexually while married to the woman they love.  Of course, the book didn't end the way I wanted it to; how could it?  I wanted them to get married and live happily ever after, but, instead, both of their lives were unnecessarily destroyed.
B0000029LG|5.0|This is simply one the greatest record ever made.The first CD contains nothing but number one hits,but just too bad 'Smooth Criminal' isn't on it.And the second CD is also fantastic.I don't agree with the official review saying that MJ time is up.He has just begun.Just listen to 'They don't care about us' ,this song makes you wanna jump up and dance on the tables.Not to mention the other songs.Each track of this CD is worth your money.He still is and always will be The King of Pop,no matter what anyone says.
B00004U2A1|5.0|....I love Sam Raimi. Evil Dead 2 has got to be simply one of the  best Horror/Comedies out there. Bruce Cambell is a great actor and I'm still wondering why he hasn't gotten a decent flick after this Trilogy of not so much Terror, but more of Gore. Although Evil Dead 2 can seem very stupid and full of over acting, it's not. The camera work is simply amazing. Not for all tastes definately. But, if you like a fun, entertaining, laugh a minute, thrill a minute roller coaster ride in to your imagination, Evil Dead 2 is the movie to watch. Also recommended, the hilarious follow up, Army of Darkness.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|I was extreamly disapointed. Even the action couldn't justify the lame script and poor acting. Watching this movie was about as exciting or entertaining as driving in bumper to bumper traffic during rush hour, with a broken radio. I was gone in 60 seconds.. to see another movie. Surprisingly poor film for Bruckheimer and Cage.
B00003CX8J|5.0|If you are the type who only watches old Benny Hill videos on your dying VCR, don't buy this movie.  However, if you are the type who watches movies to be entertained, and bought your DVD player with &quot;Intent to Enjoy,&quot; by all means, whip out your credit card.  This movie is good clean fun.  Dark (yet not depressing), witty (yet not dopey), sit back and enjoy this ride.  To those who think there is too much character development in the beginning, I say &quot;Pshaw, it was durn interesting.&quot;  Think there was not enough fighting?  Geez, just watch the news if that is what you are looking for.  And to those who thought that Anna Paquin wasn't so hot, i challenge you to do better.  All in all, if you watch movies to be interested in the story and characters while simultaneously being dazzled by special effects, this is for you.
0375420525|3.0|Sections of House of Leaves are absolutely brilliant. Danielewski is obviously whip-smart, but for me, a good book doesn't strut about, asserting its author's intelligence. While the journeys through the impossible house are often thrilling, the Johnny Truant narrative rarely rises above the level of decent graduate student writing. <br />If the writer believes all the hype he's garnered, his next book will be worse.

6304711905|5.0|Kurt Russell can play a tough yet romantic guy better than any action star in Hollywood.  He and Val Kilmer are fabulous in Tombstone.  The plot was refreshing, new, interesting.  Don't bother with Wyatt Earp w. Kevin Costner, just see Tombstone!  Again and again and again...
B000006ZGF|5.0|This is the Holy Grail!! Find it and the music will give you life eternal. Rings Around The Moon is a rare treat. Robin has never been better. The rest of the album is just pure heaven. Even Maurice sounds great and should get 1 or 2 solos on the next album, &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; due out in March or April. &quot;I Will&quot; is as good as any boy group product out there today, showing the real talent behind the Gibbs, writing and arranging.&quot;Alone&quot; is worth the price of the album all by itself.
0395324416|5.0|The Silmarillion raised so many questions that Tolkien fans almost felt cheated when the book came out in 1977.  Fortunately, Christopher Tolkien foresaw the readers' hunger for more material about Middle-earth would not be quenched and he promised in the foreword to publish some related material when time permitted.<br />What came next was Unfinished Tales, a less-than-satisfying collection of stories and notes about the heroes and kings of the three Ages.  But the disappointment didn't lay in the quality of the stories.  Rather, it was only their various states of incompleteness, even though some tales (like &quot;The Disaster of the Gladden Fields&quot;) were truly fully formed.<br />The book is most valuable to people who want to know more about the histories and heroes of Middle-earth.  People looking for Hobbit-lore will be disappointed.  The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien reveals more about Hobbits than Unfinished Tales.  But there are exciting moments and awesome scenes, such as when Ulmo rises out of the sea before Tuor, and when Isildur realizes that the One Ring has betrayed him to his doom, which stand alongside the most memorable passages of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion.<br />Unfinished Tales shows us Tolkien at his best when he was doing nothing more than just writing out his thoughts concerning various peoples and events only mentioned in The Lord of the Rings.
B0000566KK|5.0|No one but no one cand nor will they ever top the singing of Francis Albert Sinatra.  The ease in which he sang, the  controlled editing of songs that he did while on stage, will never be topped by any other singer.  He could take a no-nothing song and like magic turn it into something that everyone would like.  He is, and always will  be the best all-around singer to have came.  I am glad he came during my generation.  I was lucky to have been there during those great Paramount Theatre days. He like Leanordo di Vinci will live forever....Eddie 'B'
0345345061|4.0|Not really planned by Tolkien himself, A Tolkien Reader is more properly a Tolkien Sampler.  It combines two of his shorter books (The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Farmer Giles of Ham) with other material Tolkien wrote through the years, including the dark and autobiographical allegory &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot;.<br />Tolkien commentators usually hold out this book as a resource for his &quot;On Fairy-stories&quot; essay (actually the transcript of a lecture Tolkien delivered in the 1930s) and &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son&quot;.  Both works are of narrow appeal, however, as they require a minimal knowledge of some scholarly details on the reader's part.<br />&quot;On Fairy-stories&quot; and &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; were originally published as Tree and Leaf in 1964, but they don't really explain how Tolkien achieved The Lord of the Rings.  He admitted that the story took on a life of its own, and he ended up incorporating several disparate works into the new mythology he was creating.  LoTR fans who want to know more about Middle-earth will find the only relevant material is in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, a collection of several poems (of which only the first two actually deal with Tom).  Tolkien included some explanatory notes.<br />The Bombadil book was originally composed and produced so Tolkien could present his beloved aging aunt with a special volume in the last year of her life.  She died only a few months after it was published.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Dream Works really hit it big this time. This is their best movie yet. And, the best DVD movie I own so far (I know, I know, there is no Episode I on DVD to compare with).  I really enjoyed this movie when it came out on the big screen. Now, Gladiator's DVD version is movie heaven. Really good, well composed menus and the kind of features you'll spect for a movie like this. That is: a historical documentary, production story boards, interviews, comentaries, etc. All in the best artistic! menus I've seen.<br /> Gladiator is a great epic with a great story, cool photography and ,even ,superb special effects. And, it is from Ridley Scott the guy who directed Blade Runner (I loved him for that, now I love him even more) The story telling is magnificent. Music from Hans Zimmer (the guy from Rainman, Mission Impossible 2 and The Lion King); I'm about to buy the soundtrack as I write this. The overall experience of the DVD movie will probably keep you at the edge of your seat, believe me.
B00004Z459|4.0|Hanging out with a few friends a couple of weeks ago someone mentioned they heard a band named Linkin Park was doing a show at a club called Fletchers in Baltimore that evening. I hadn't heard of the band previously so I really didn't expect much from the show but having nothing to do that night I figured why not just go for the hell of it... boy was I wrong. The guys are really great to see live, they put on quite an intense show for such a small venue. I actually went out and picked up the CD the very next day. Lets just say this CD has yet to leave my player for over a month...<br />Having read just about all the other reviews on this board though I really feel the need to point something out that's bugging me. Quite a few times people have said something to the effect of, &quot;Great CD, every song is good except for number 11, that track just doesn't fit.&quot; If you haven't noticed already, Linkin Park does not have a Bass player. The only way they are able to really keep their sound together without one is Joseph Hahn on the turntables. <br />You can argue all you want that Chester and Mike's vocals complementing each other are what sets this band apart, and to an extent you'd be correct. Both of those guys are amazing... but a large part of what makes them sound so good is Joe spinning away in the background. Anyways, lets just give a little credit where the credit is due.<br />About the CD itself though, rarely do you find such a piece of music that you can listen to from start to finish and never feel the urge to skip around. The flow from one song to next is incredible. If you don't believe me, just listen to the transition from 'A Place For My Head' into 'Forgotten', the entire mood of the music changes yet unless you're actually paying attention you won't even notice the switch from one to the other... simply amazing. This CD is definitely worthy of a purchase.
B00004YA66|5.0|As a fan of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, I found &quot;Frequency&quot; to be one of the most enjoyable movies ever. The story and script are both well written. It's something that you can't imagine could happen, but makes you wonder &quot;what if you can communicate with your own self, in the past or future?&quot;. What I like the most is you cannot (or don't want to) guess what comes next. And the ending is most satisfying. This movie is worth wathcing a few more times. Again, who needs bad languages to make a movie works? 2 thumbs up for the producers and directors.
B00003CXIY|3.0|I hate Tom Green.  Let's get that established right away.  But, suprisingly I enjoyed this movie.  There was a lot of humor and a lot of grossness.  It portrayed typical college dudes.  A lot of new faces in this film and some old, but not seasoned ones.  This movie is in the same category as films like Animal House and the new one, &quot;Dude, Where's my car?&quot;  Although it doesn't live up to the standard that Animal House does, &quot;Road Trip&quot; is still funny and entertaing.  Even for people that have never experienced a &quot;Road Trip&quot;.
B00003CWL6|3.0|American Beauty is about an over privileged society wallowing in self pity and neurosis in a way that could only be of interest to the wallowers themselves.
0399103422|5.0|&quot;The Godfather&quot; is a staggering triumph, an incredible work of art, and (in my opinion) the greatest work of fiction ever written.  The movie was also great, but it doesn't compare to the book or even come close (if you enjoyed the movie, PLEASE do yourself a favor and read the book).<br />Claiming this as my favorite (fictional) book is an amazing thing, given that I've been reading since I was a young child, and have read many of the classics as well as popular literature.  &quot;The Godfather&quot; truly outshines them all.  But don't take my word for it, buy the book and read it for yourself.  It's a book that can be read again and again... in fact, it can be read immediately after the first reading, and it all seems fresh every single time.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I became a Maiden fan at age 13 with Piece of Mind, but lost track of them at the end of the eighties. I drifted more into Pink Floyd, Zappa, later into blues and jazz, and left heavy metal behind. Heard some tracks of the X Factor a few years ago, but they couldn't convince me. But a few days back, I picked up this album in the public library. WOW! What a surprise! The eighties line-up, that made me a fan back then, strengthened with Gers, what a sound! Bruce Dickinson's voice has grown, became more solid, Steve Harris' songwriting capabilities are stronger than ever, not to mention his virtuoso playing.  My enthousiasm is not just the nostalgia of a 30 year old to his teens (if it were so I'd better put on some eighties records). No, my friends, this is a sountrack for the 21st Century. Hey, you Irons, forgive my more than a decade-long mutiny, and count me in again! Maiden's back!
B000002X2B|5.0|The other side, of course, is horrible.  Oh well, no matter.  Yes, the piano is Grace, Paul is playing the ever-present acoustic guitar, also superb work on his part.  But Jerry Garcia does his finest guitar work of his career.  Jack Cassidy's bass work on the opening cut is essential.  Someone once described his bass playing as being appropriate to the coronation of a pharaoh.
B000001IPL|3.0|this cd is not a favorite of mine.  the offspring have always been able to draw the metal listeners (bands like Korn, i dont listen to it), and still keep the punk rock crowd interested.  I don't like this cd much though, mainly because they're songs are boring and uninspired, but thats just me... i like &quot;what happened to you?&quot; a bit.  for all you korn fans, i'd suggest you listen to &quot;i fell asleep on my arm&quot; by the Aquabats off their new b-side cd.. and that includes all you ratm and limp bizkit people too.
B000001Y5J|5.0|I could have happiness in slavery if I had this cd with me...  This is one of my favorite NIN cds to date (I have 14 so far) along with TDS and The Fragile. Pinion is a great opener for the CD, as well as most NIN concerts. Wish is plain great, and who wouldn't like a song that is [so honest]? Last is a great song as well... Help me I am in hell is very moody and makes me think of a person sulking and seething when I hear it. Happiness in Slavery is perhaps my favorite NIN song of all time, and it's video may make your stomach turn! Gave Up makes me want to...listen to it. ....  But so is all NIN. Tracks 7-97 are average I guess you can say. Physical is interesting, the only not really heavy song on their, although Suck is arguably not as heavy either. .... This album is very angry and is the heaviest NIN. It is best to listen to this very loud. ...
B00004T37H|5.0|Princess Mononoke is one of the best anime films I've ever seen. Each scene is breathtaking. When I saw this for the first time, I hadn't heard anything about anime. I was introduced to a whole new world of filmmaking, one that I didn't know existed. I would recommend this to anyone, and if you liked it try movies like &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; or &quot;Nausicaa.&quot;
B0000027RL|4.0|This is one of Pearl Jam's best albums, in my opinion. It has great lyrics and the music is something I just don't get sick of. It's not the best of all the albums they have made over the years, but it's pretty... close. The little tracks at the beginning and end [aren't my favs], but they tie the whole thing together. I recommend it for anyone who is a fan of Pearl Jam and real rock music.
B000002LAC|5.0|So I grew up with this album, my mother playing it all the time.  It is so moving that it cannot be described in words.
0804106304|5.0|The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan is an extraordinary book that exhibits the spirit of the heart through about ten short stories. Although the setup of the book can be a bit confusing, it really does add to the ambiance and feeling of the story. Having the book split up also makes it a very easy read.   I really enjoyed this story because it has to do with different types of mother-daughter relationships. The novel acts as an insight into a world that the reader would normally never get to see. You get to read all about what the mothers know about life and what the daughters think they know about life. In a sense the reader becomes involved in the story because we get to find out secretes at the same time the characters in the book discover them.  This is also a very good book because it has a very personal and unique style. Not many writers can have so many different little stories in one book and still keep a sense of congruity flowing through it. Tan uses a mix of Asian and American terminology to give the story a feeling of authenticity and realness.   However this book is not for everyone. Men would definitely not enjoy it because they would have trouble relating to it. Since this story is all about what women feel men would not be able to understand and comprehend many of the view's Tan relates in her stories.   Overall this is a wonderful book because of the sense of realness it possesses. I was able to really picture the events that are described really happening to someone. It is an extraordinary story that can be understood by many people no matter their age or race.<br />P.S. The move does not give the book justice, but it still does a very good job. So if you have seen the movie and have not read the book you really need to read it because you don't know what you are missing!

0812589041|4.0|Ender's Game is a great book. I really enjoy reading it. I don't like to read science fiction book but this was not all that bad as I thought it would be. It began with a boy name Ender whose real name is Andrew. He is a third in family meaning he is a third child and it was against the law to have third child. A family could only have two children but Ender was special case. Ender had great mind. He was very clever boy. The military needed that. They needed Ender to fight war again buggers (buggers are alien like creatures). Ender was six years old when the military took him to outer space. Their idea was to train Ender and make him eligible to be a commander. The people in military put too much pressure on Ender. When Ender became commander of an army in battle school, he was forced to battle everyday. He was given untrained army but still he won all the games. He had the mind and intelligent to out smart this enemy and because of that he fought a war at age of 11. The little boy had courage and intelligent to do anything. The book gives so much details. It concentrates on what's most important. Ender was smart kid but he wouldn't be able to go without love. He had a sister name Valentine. She was older than him and loved him very much. Valentine's love kept Ender together in most difficult situations. There were times when Ender just wanted to quite but thinking that Valentine loved him and waiting for her little brother to come home gave courage to fight on. It is a great story. I enjoyed it very much and I hope others will enjoy it as much as I did.
B000002MY3|5.0|This has got to be my favourite album of all time.  Featuring the UK hit singles One Hand In My Pocket, You Learn,  Head Over Feet Ironic and All I Really Want this album has hit written all over it.  Alanis has one of the best voices about at the moment and her ability to write such excellent lyrics is astounding.  This album has now sold over 28 million copies so i cant be the only one who thinks this.

B00004VWAF|4.0|This is not music, this is a soundscape. Although it may sound a little bit old fashioned to today's ears, I think it's a great soundscape after all.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|If you see the VCD version, you will notice that its not the same movie, most scenes were added and modified, in this DVD release , some scenes were modified and cuted from the original version that passed in theaters in America. ( they were added in the deleted scenes, in the bonus )
B0000013GT|5.0|This album is just too hype, but cool and smooth. I mean hype as in how good it is, but it wasn't until Stankonia until u could truly say Outkast was Hype as in hyperactive and really good. But this album stands out alone as probably the best (though I  haven't heard no more than 3 tracks of their first album). The album shows that Outkast is wise(Intro, 13th Floor/Growing old, Babylon and others), as well as people who can rock a party. <br />My fav. tracks are Two Dope Boyz(in a Cadillac), Elevators, Wheelz of Steel, Atliens, Jazzy Belle, Mainstream, and E.T. But the others are just short of perfection. And im glad someone mentioned of how wheelz of steel is so addictive because i feel the same as along with half of this album. <br />Another thing is this album was made with REAL instruments and they would do so pushing the envelope a little more with each album. I really have a thing with hiphop groups that have real music backing them up (The Roots, Freestyle fellowship).
B000002C1V|5.0|An amazing album is one that positively flows from song-to-song. Reference Abbey Road or the un-released (yet well known to fans) Gamehendge by Phish. Pink Floyd was notorious for this in their latter years (Animals, Wall, Final Cut). Despite many claims that Pros/Cons was a lackluster album, it shared the same trait (personally, it's my fav). My bottom line is that Roger Waters, while a paranoid and unforgiving stage performer, is an incredible song writer and singer with soul. Final Cut embodies this soul, and interpret it anyway you like, it's a heartbreaking, honest, and wonderful album.
0684853523|5.0|I have a deep desire to write and I enjoy reading Stephen King's novels.  So this book seemed like a dream come true.  Stephen King uses his style throughout the book of growing up amid terrors and trials with the baby-sitter, straight from &quot;Misery.&quot; His way with words astounds me and makes me aware that I need to read more.<br />Stephen King talks about his near fatal accident and describes it with the same clarity and horror that he uses in his story-telling.  You can almost feel the troubled breathing and the pain that he experienced when he was life-flighted in a helicopter for his emergency treatment.  Thank heavens that he made it through this experience!<br />I like the way that he guides us through his writing techniques: write 4 to 6 hours daily; use your intuition; the story comes before any plot; stay away from adverbs; watch that grammar and write 3 drafts before you finish your story.  So now all I have to do is start to read the 3 pages of recommended books that King lists at the end of his memoir and begin to write.  Now I know that writing can't be that easy; and his talent can't be imitated.  But I agree with Stephen, writing can be therapeutic!
B00004SCX6|2.0|\\"Oops!... I did it again\\" is a good try by Britney. This is not the best CD in the world but it is Extemely better than the  album \\"Baby One More Time.\\" There are many good songs on here Like the title track, \\"What U See Is What U Get\\", \\"Cant Make You Love Me\\", and \\"Stronger\\". There are the annoying songs like the ballads \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know,\\" \\"When Your Eyes Say It\\" and the extremely horrendous \\"One Kiss From You\\" which is what many people call filler space. All together it was a good try by Ms. Spears. So If your a Britney Fan than this CD is For you.
B00004W55E|5.0|Where in heaven's name did this voice come from?! As a vocalist myself, I have listened to and been inspired by many an amazing voice; talents that shine and awe me by either their creative, technical or lyrical standard. Artistes like Aretha, Stevie, Elton, Patti, Ella, Frank, Whitney and even the more current debutantes like Lauryn, Erykah, Mariah, and Yolanda are examples of this musical excellence and consistency. It is a rare occurrence however, to experience an artiste whose instrument seemingly encompasses ALL the qualities that are facets of the aforementioned performers! An incredible range, very pleasing tone and vocal quality, a well mastered jazz/soul technique, really wonderful and creative instrumentation and arrangements, and a definite lyrical standard. This album is SO much, it's almost overwhelming. Hats off to Ms. Farrell. THIS project is pure INSPIRATION.
B00004W5UA|5.0|Excellent bit of postmodern stitching. Shows that holywood can actually throw around a bit of literature when they put themselves to task. Love that self-referential, yeah, we are telling you a story, and we're fully aware of that fact, not just as actors, but as characters. Puts things in a slightly different light. &quot;I want you to hit me as hard as you can.&quot;
6304602979|3.0|The actual camera work and acting in this film is well done. it is entertaining, however not very original. this movie is much too similar to Terrence Mallicks Badlands. The score is exactly the same. If you are going to re-make a film, make it better. The problem I have with Terrentino, is he  borrowes ideas and does not change them. it is one thing to borrow ideas, but at least use them to accent  your own style. He has done nothing that really sets him apart from others. The films he has made have all  been done, and done better i might add.  His trade marks were all stolen from earlier film makers. this film is over rated, however it should be enjoyed if you are purely looking to be entertained.
B000002UV9|5.0|This is my second favorite cd in my collection...and it would be my first if Queensryche hadn't released Operation:  Mindcrime two years before this one.  The songs are all good.  The only weak one is &quot;Hand on Heart&quot; which is a little lame and 80'Sish.  Other than that every song is just truly excellent.  &quot;Jet City Woman&quot; is my favorite song of all time.  &quot;Anybody Listening&quot; is one of the best metal ballads ever.  &quot;Empire&quot; is the best anti-government song not on Mindcrime ever.  &quot;Another Rainy Night&quot; was one of my least favorite songs when I first got it, but it grew on me and is now one of my favorites.  And all the others are similarly amazing.  If you ever wondered how great metal could be, listen to this album.
B000002AGN|4.0|&quot;it was never supposed to be a hit&quot; says Paul Desmond of &quot;Take five&quot;, the number penned by himself on this album. His statement was perhaps representative of this album.<br />Recorded by the Dave Brubeck quartet in 1959, consisting of Dave Brubeck (piano), Paul Desmond (alto sax), Eugene Wright (bass) and Joe Morello (drums), this aptly titled album explores the use of odd time signatures not commonly used in jazz, much less western music. Influenced by music from their travels in the Middle East and India, the quartet attempts to incorporate much of the rhythms into this album. Their effort resulted in this landmark work.<br />&quot;Blue Rondo a la Turk&quot;, with its 9/8 transitioning to 4/4 straight ahead blues in block chords and back again to 9/8 starts off with the frenzied feel of a whirling dervish with a rather odd bridge into a laid back blues and back again.<br />&quot;Take Five&quot; by Paul Desmond swings with such ease that the 5/4 feel is barely felt. Witness people tapping their fingers to the odd time signature as though they have been hearing it all their lives. Joe Morello throws down some virtusotic solos in this challenging 5/4 time.<br />Unfortunately, the popularity of these two songs eclipses the beauty of the experimental feel of the rest of the album. &quot;Kathy's waltz&quot; in 4/4 transitioning to 6/4, while not odd time signatures by jazz standards certainly is unusual for its transition in those days.<br />The album has stood the test of time and curiously enough, it is the 2 songs which were stylistically the most adventurous which are remembered. <br />The body of work seems somewhat constrained to the swing jazz idiom. Perhaps this is understandable with the emergence of west coast cool and the era of Miles Davis, and Stan Kenton et al. It is only with the advent of electric instruments and the Mahavishnu Orchestra which were able to further push the envelope of the odd time signature a notch further. <br />Allin all, a Jazz album must have.
B0000029DD|5.0|This is on David Bowie's &quot;Top Ten Albums of All Time&quot; list.  I bought it recently out of curiosity, having never heard of Jeff Buckley.  My conclusion:  Bowie was right.  This record is so tremendous, I am in awe of this work of art.  One random thing that really grasps me is the tremendous sound of the drums and high-hat, which I usually don't even notice.   Buckley's voice will make you cry.  Furthermore, the guitars are my life.  My writing is so futile and worthless, compared to the beauty, excellence, and power of this remarkable album.
6300163423|5.0|Eventhough the performances of Mickey Rourke, Rober De Niro and Charlotte Rampling earned a lot of praise and are mostly talked about when this film is discussed, its greatest value is its ultimate noir quality. As Raymond Chandler once put it, every detective in a real good mystery is really in search of himself, simultaneously trying to evade his personal hell. Harry Angel, the detective in this film, is epitome of that kind of detective.  I also liked the New Orleans-style blues.
0553106635|5.0|A Storm of Swords is easily the best fantasy novel of 2000 and, quite possibly, the best fantasy novel EVER written.  The first two in the series, A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, were both excellent but A Storm of Swords takes the series and the whole fantasy genre to the next level.<br />I don't know whether to love or hate Martin for this amazing novel.  Should I love him for his brilliant writing or hate him for making me wait another 12+ months for A Dance with Dragons to figure out is going to happen next?<br />As a fellow writer, I am in awe of Martin's deep, alomost convoluted, plots and twists.  I am certain that A Storm of Swords will make my next novel that much better for having read it.  Either that or I'll quit writing out of frustration...<br />Kenneth A. Baumbach Author, The Heretics' Power
6305807086|2.0|Ok.. I didn't enjoy this film. May be I do not have an appreciation for &quot;creative&quot; edges, maybe I was tired at the time and I need to watch it again. It just reminded me of fiction books I use to read when I was 8 (With the exception of the Adult content). But in all seriousness, I think the &quot;originality&quot; angle is severely overhyped. Its original... BIG DEAL, its boring!!
B00004Z459|1.0|Linkin Park is just another rap-metal band in a scene flooded with bands that are no different from themselves. Apparantely they think that, since they have not one, but TWO singers and they didn't have a bass player as a full time member on the cd, then they are &quot;different&quot; and therefore don't fit in with all the copycats. Well, sorry to say, but they do. It's so sad to see how watered down and commercialized rap-metal has become because of bands like this. It actually used to be a respected and interesting style of music, but now only Rage Against the Machine can claim to be any of those things. I can't wait until the day this whole thing dies out and all these bands are gone so we can get some REAL music back on MTV and radio.
B00004BZ0V|5.0|This CD does have a reason to exist. As abuttons points out, sadly, this is the only CD where you can find the original versions of &quot;Bankrobber&quot; and &quot;This is Radio Clash&quot;. That alone makes it worth the purchase price for hardcore Clash fans and collectors. For others, yes, there are far better places to start; but these two recordings are apparently becoming rare so get them while you have the chance.
B000002BVN|5.0|The album's title &quot;Blood On The Dance Floor - HIStory In The Mix&quot; is that way for a reason...'in the MIX' ..MIX..get it? This album is not really considered an actual full album.  It was simply made to promote his HIStory tour, and some of the songs were recorded earlier but have not been released until this album.    For those who criticize the album because of it's remixes, I note that it IS a REMIX album, as the title says.  This is not some kinda 'hey! he released a new album! kinda thing.    Anyways, this album sends a message of his part in the media's criticism, tabloids, and false rumors and canards.    The 5 new songs on the album are absolutely fantastic and genius in a way..  Blood On The Dance Floor is about meeting Susie who does not appear to be the LOVEable romantic kinda girl she is, and she stabs him.  It's a moral of choosing the right person and 'not judging a book by it's cover'.  Morphine, now that goes under a category of it's own.  A very awesome rock song the with Michael singing hard in an angry manner; sings about drug addiction and such.  Superfly Sister, a great and long R&amp;B that is enjoyable to listen to.  I don't know what he's singing about here, but if someone knows, I'd appreciate telling me.  Ghosts, which is the main song in his Ghosts short movie, can be considered to some as the best song on the album, where he sings about the media and tabloids that critize him,  'tell me are you the ghost of jealousy'..    Is It Scary is the song that'll keep you hypnotized under it's cool loud rythm, and MJ sings that he is not the so called eccentric person the media makes him look like.    Now for the remixes.  Most of the remixes are very well made. The best one is Scream Louder, which is the remix for Scream.  The next best ones are 2 Bad, Money, and HIStory.  As for the rest, they're pretty cool if you get used to them, but not as good as the previous mentioned ones.  But again, it is and would not be right to judge the album negatively by its remixes, because the album was made especially for its remixes, as the title says already.    This ablum proves Michael Jackson is the greatest, very hard working, and surely the King Of Pop.  He is a hard worker, as that is seen especially in his Morphine song.  If you buy the album, look at the cover 'pamphlet', open to the Morphine sectioin, and you'll see that he has put way too much effort onto this song especially.    Overall, this album deserves 5 stars and more, as the remixes are nice to listen to, and the new songs are one of his best to date.

079213690X|4.0|I personally enjoyed this movie very much. It could have had a little less nudity, but other than that its was a masterpiece. It was set in the times of the Scottish wars where feuding kingdoms battled each other for honor. Mel Gibson plays a man who is a fierce warrior who finds the love of a woman that is very special to him. I don't want to tell you the end ( i forgot it! ) but this is a vey good movie and i would  reccommend it to anybody who likes these knids of movies.

0679721037|5.0|I found this book to be very interesting and insightful. I had never read any books on the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan but had been curious about it for some time. This book answers some of the questions that I had and revealed things that I had no knowledge of. The book follows the lives of five people who were in Hiroshima at the time of the bomb dropping. It chronicles the people, places and horrors that they were witness to after the bomb had devasted there homes and lives in Hiroshima. The book was written shortly after these events took place so the stories and feelings that are related in the book are fresh and vivid. Not since Hiroshima and Nagasaki has mankind been subjected to such devastating destruction. This story should never be forgotten for fear of repeating this sad time in history.
B00000JH09|5.0|When I bought this track I was expecting live garbage.  But when I popped this bad mamma jamma into my CD player I was blown away.

B00000612P|5.0|This 1971 album is far and away the best Rod Stewart album and one of the Top 10 albums of that decade.  This was only his third album and it went to the top of the album charts both in the U.S. and the U.K., whereas \\"Gasoline Alley,\\" released the previous year had only made it to #27 on the Billboard chart (it would not be until 1979 that Stewart would have another album reach #1, with \\"Blondes Have More Fun\\").  In the early part of his career Stewart managed to find interesting ways of mixing folk, rock, blues and country, both in his single career and as the front man for the Faces, who released both their second (\\"Long Player\\") and third albums (\\"A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...To a Blind Horse Faces\\") that year as well (\\"Stay With Me\\" was the big hit off of the later).  So for Rod Stewart 1971 was a very good year.<br /><br />The big single off of this album, of course, is \\"Maggie May,\\" hit #1 for several weeks (this was the first song we played for our daughter Maggie, the day after she was born).  This is one of the great songs about being seduced by an older woman.  Two other singles charted, the rockin' cover of \\"(I Know) I'm Losing You\\" originally done by the Temptations, which made it to #24, and Stewart's poignant cover of Tim Hardin's \\"Reason to Believe,\\" which ends the album on a quiet note and made it to #62.  Then there is the exquisite \\"Mandolin Wind\\" (played by some guy Rod forgot the name of) and the frenetic energy of the title track, which lulls you into a false sense of security by beginning with an acoustic guitar part before the drums start drivin' this one hard and fast.  Surprisingly, most of the songs on this one are covers, the exceptions between \\"Mandolin Wind\\" and the title track, the latter co-written by Stewart with lead guitarist Ron Wood.<br /><br />Stewart exhibits a lot of range on this album and for me the only that could possible qualify as a misfire would be the cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Tomorrow Is Such a Long Time,\\" which is a bit ironic because you would think that would work.  \\"Seems Like a Long Time\\" is pretty good, as is the rollickin' \\"That's All Right\\" by \\"Big Boy\\" Crudup.  I even love the sheet music on the \\"back cover\\" (\\"It's Full of Good Things and Loads of Suggestions\\"). As far as I am concerned if your choice is between this and a Rod Stewart \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD, get this one because it is all downhill for Stewart from this point on.you would think that would work.  \\"Seems Like a Long Time\\" is pretty good, as is the rollickin' \\"That's All Right\\" by \\"Big Boy\\" Crudup.

B00004SZWD|5.0|If I could only own one album, this would be it! Stevie worked far beyond his original deadline to provide us with a diverse collection of songs. His humanity and spirituality are revealed in powerful lyrics, and very moving melodies. The variety of styles and messages are unprecedented. The feel of the songs range from classical, to soul, to R&amp;B, and some styles which are uniquely Stevie's. Just listening is a great experience, but I highly recommend reading the lyrics, as they have great impact even without the music.

Plath's main character, Esther Greenwood, a talented writer living in NYC and working for a fashion magazine, finds life as a female to be a terrific struggle of choosing between and conforming to the cookie-cutter &quot;good girl&quot; or &quot;bad girl&quot; roles of society.  Consequently, Esther continuously references her inability to pick from the world's &quot;fig tree&quot; of female roles; she does not want to conform to ONE single role because she is diverse in both her thoughts and abilities.  Plagued by her &quot;abnormal&quot; (as seen by society) desires for female equality, Plath loses her sense of identity and ends up in a mental institute attempting to overcome oppression from the conformity that she cannot defeat.<br />Will Esther conquer or succumb to the pressures of life's &quot;bell jar&quot;?  Only by reading this symbolic novel of self-discovery can one uncover Esther's true fate.  Down-to-earth with real-life characters who suffer real-life problems, this novel proves to be a great read for anyone who is looking for lessons on how to prevent and/or overcome personal trials in life.  Learning from the examples/mistakes of Esther, the reader grasps insight into life lessons throughout the novel.  Skillfully incorporating various symbols and themes into the text, Plath engenders a literary masterpiece as well as work of art.<br />  Indeed, I am convinced that if a reader is willing to open up both his heart and his mind to the sensitive issues of this novel, he will not be let down.
B00004XONN|5.0|Hey guys! do you think he really woke up sucking a lemon, or is it me? My boyfriend(yes, i am gay)told me that it must have been from a drink the night before like a gin an tonic, let's say.Well, anyhoo i just love it, it cheers me up
B00000G3PA|4.0|Yes, Deep impact had a more coherent story line. Yes Deep Impact was more realistic. But come on...did anyone really believe John Mclain was such a super cop in Die Hard? No, we went to be entertained. I like watching movies to escape reality, not live it. I can pick up the newspaper or watch the news anytime I want a reality check. Being a guy, I absorbed as much of the bass and sound effects that I possibly could and loved every minute of it. Excellent movie if you want action. Looking for romance? Get Pretty Woman or something, this movie isn't for you.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|Affirmation is a good follow up CD.  It's really hard to make a CD better than their first.  In an interview with them, Savage Garden said that they felt guilty that they didn't express their feelings enough in their first album.  One would think after selling over eleven million records of their last album that they wouldn't change their format, but they did.  Most artists don't care how their music sounds and just write what other people want to hear.  Savage Garden is awesome for standing up for themselves and playing music that they can call their own.  Because of this, their CD is a little softer than the other, but is still really good.  Crash and Burn, The Animal Song, You Can Still be Free, and Gunning Down a Romance are my favorite songs.  I Knew I Loved You is pretty good too, and spent at least a month at number one on both the adult conteporary charts and the pop charts.  Buy this and their first self-titled album.
B000002OR4|5.0|I downloaded a few of these songs on Napster and it was one of the first cds I've bought in years.  That kind of work deserves to be supported.  I'm 16 years old and I honestly think that even the punks / racists at my school would be moved by this soundtrack.  Even the coldest person can not keep the butterflys from their stomache, or the tears from their eyes while listening to it.
B00003CXDD|5.0|The first time i saw this excellent movie must have been about 10 or more years ago...at the time I was 9 years of age. I havent seen it since, I live in sweden so I seem to be the only one here that know the movie even existed =). A dvd release would sure bring back alot of good childhood memories and that would be awesome... Therefore i ll call george tomorrow and ask him to release it... dont thank me - im just so damn nice.=). // ciao
6300213668|5.0|This movie is probably one of the most enduring movies of all time, and no surprise either. With sharp, witty dialogue, and fabulous songs that you will continue to sing for weeks, it is a constant joy to watch over and over again. None of the characters are two-dimensional, not even the members of the supporting cast. Instead, each has his or her own individuality, and each clamours for attention from the audience. This movie is a lot of fun, but it isn't meant to be taken too seriously, as it doesn't possess much moral fibre. A great movie. If you haven't seen it, see it.
B00004W55E|5.0|no conocia a rachelle ferrell. Hace poco en USA encontre su album y lo escuche  por curiosidad, pensando que solo seria otra voz mas, de la media. Mi sorpresa y mi alegria como amante dela musica,fueron grandes al encontrarme con una personalidad , una voz, un tratamiento de las canciones como pocas veces se da. Darle un lugar favorito entre mis cd fue obligatorio y muy placentero. Creo que este cd es una gran adquisicion para cualquier persona que guste de la musica.No me imagino a quien puede no atraparlo.
B000002MTR|3.0|I was excited when I first heard that Dave Navarro was joining the Chili Peppers.  It seemed like a dream-team fusion of two of my favourite bands.  I hoped that this new entity would be 3/4 Chili and 1/4 Jane.  Unfortunately what surfaced was more 3/4 Jane and 1/4 Chili.  Now, this compound was wonderful when Flea joined Perry, Dave, and Stephen for a late-'90's Jane's reunion.  His funky bass was a great addition to that mix.  But it doesn't work here, for several reasons.<br />First, the Chili rhythm section is wasted as a quasi-metal outfit.  Jane's was great at that, deconstructing the power-chord to the point where it resembled art.  But Flea and (drummer) Chad Smith, while occasionally high energy and hard hitting, are at their best in plush polyrhythms.  Former (and now current) guitarist John Frusciante fit in perfectly in this regard.  But Navarro, a great textural guitarist, is not usually counted on to carry a groove (&quot;Stop!&quot; notwithstanding).  I should have known trouble was a-brewing when in pre-release publicity interviews, Dave professed a profound distaste for funk.  Oh no!  He does give it the old college try.  Listen to his laid back staccato rhythms on &quot;Aeroplane&quot;, or the jazzy wah-wah work in the addictive &quot;Walkabout&quot;.  But for the rest of the record, he just doesn't seem willing to try any more of these compromises.<br />Second, Anthony Kiedis is no Perry Farrell.  That's not a slight, mind you.  Anthony does what he does better than anyone else.  He can deliver simple soulful singing on one song, and credible party rapping on others.  But he doesn't have the vocal chops to do what Perry Farrell does.  Perry's voice is an ethereal instrument, and his melodic phrasing is always unexpected.  Anthony tries to emulate those qualities here (&quot;Warped&quot;, &quot;Deep Kick&quot;, &quot;Shallow Be Thy Game&quot;), but it's just not in him.  This even leaks into the songs of conventional melody.  There are specific points in both &quot;Tearjerker&quot; and &quot;Transcending&quot; where he's unsure of how to phrase his lyrics.  He seems uncomfortable throughout the whole record.<br />There are some great moments here, though.  &quot;Aeroplane&quot; is an ecstatic song, held together by a wicked Flea groove.  The acoustic guitar from 'BloodSugarSexMagik's &quot;Breaking the Girl&quot; makes a welcome return on &quot;My Friends&quot;.  &quot;Tearjerker&quot; is a touching profession of love (to Kurt Cobain, I believe).  As I said before, &quot;Walkabout&quot; is an interesting, funky workout for all involved.  It's probably my favourite track here.  And &quot;Transcending&quot; is mostly beautiful.  It begins with a spiraling bass line, and has some nice overlapping vocals in the middle section.  But it breaks down during the coda; an off-putting right turn into metal riffing.<br />I love the Chilis.  I'm glad John is back with the band.  I now know that the Dave experiment was a tad misguided, a case of friends not meshing musically.  However, I do enjoy most of this album.  If anything, it's an interesting experiment.  One that produces some fine moments, but others that just don't work.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is one of the best Pink Floyd albums,the sax and keyboards strings was replaced by hard guitars (Gilmour and White) the lyrics are real and acid,all the humans are identificated with the dogs,pigs or sheeps. The track 1 and 5 were a surprise to me (romantic songs of Waters!),but dogs is the best song,Gilmour attack and waters defense is the most beautiful lyric
B000001GBJ|5.0|This CD is definitely targeting a certain audience which appreciates gorgeous intrumental music. &quot;Nocturne&quot; is by far the best piece in this wonderful compilation and it won the Grand Prix back in 1995 representing Norway in the annual Eurovision Song Contest.  This was the first time Norway had ever won in this 40 year-old contest and the first time that a predominantly instrumental song claimed the victory.
B000051VWW|4.0|A friend of mine just gave me this CD as a gift, knowing that I am a die-hard Sade fan.  I have never met anyone who has not liked her music; either you love her stuff, or you don't because you have never heard of her.  I have been waiting for years for Sade to come out with a new album, and so I just couldn't wait to pop the CD into my player. Sade's CD is not bad; she can sing &quot;row your boat&quot; and I would never tire of hearing her voice, but I miss the sensual punch she dealt in her other CDs.  I have every single one of her albums, and her music always makes me think of sandy beaches, nighttime tropical breezes, dancing barefoot in an evening gown at an emptied out jazz club at 5 am...but Lovers Rock failed to conjure up any of these images for me. It didn't have that exotic/jazzy originality from her older music. Some of the songs are even downright folky, a characteristic I don't associate with Sade. Her voice and style are definitely inimitable, but I can already tell this won't be my favorite Sade CD.
B000051VWW|5.0|Sade has become one of those artists whose recordings I will by without having heard them, resting assured that I won't be disatisfied with my purchase.  I happened to be in a record store a few weeks ago, and this cd was playing.  Though I only stayed long enough to hear one chorus of the title track &quot;Lover's Rock&quot;, the hook of the chorus stuck in my head until I finally, inevitably bought a copy.  I was not disappointed, and considered the cd a promise fulfilled.  Sade basically picks up where she left off with some of her later recordings, straying from her initial sound (which counered her voice wonderfully against saxaphone) to a more subdued, acoustic sound which puts her unique voice and evocative lyrics in the spotlight they deserve.  The featured instrument here is her voice, harmonized with itself  through the magic of over-dubbing.  This is grown-up music in that it bypasses the trends of celebrity-producer-rapper cameos and endless melismas and focuses on honest, straightfoward music.  Stand-out tracks include &quot;By Your Side&quot;, &quot;King of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;All About Our Love&quot;, &quot;and &quot;Lover's Rock&quot;, not to say that the rest of the cd is filler.  Every song here stands on it's own quite well.  It all satisfies.  In the end, more of the same from Sade is more than enough.
B00000JJQK|5.0|&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; has become one of my all time favorite records.I can't stop playing this  newer  version.The first 14 songs are recorded in Mono,then repeats in Stereo.When Paul McCartney and George Martin heard &quot;Pet Sounds,&quot; they were amazed.This Album was the Blueprint for the Classic,&quot;Sgt.Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band,&quot;and The Beatles,&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was the blueprint for this record.Brian Wilson was Blown away after hearing the album.He stopped touring with The Beach Boys,and just wanted to work in the studio.&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is more of a solo record by Brian,and his partner,Tony Asher.When the single,&quot;Caroline No,&quot;came out,The Beach Boys name wasn't even on the record.The cut bearly made the top 40.No one knew who Brian Wilson was.This is my Second favorite cut from the album.&quot;God only Knows,&quot; with Carl Wilson on lead,is  unreal,The vocal arangments  are perfection, and its one of the first songs to have God in it.This has got to be one of the greatest records ever made. My other favorite cuts are &quot;You still Believe in me,&quot;I'm Waiting for the day,&quot;and&quot; I know there's an answer.The CD comes with a 31 page booklet that tells you all about the recording of the album.I've been playing this CD for two weeks,and I can't get these songs out of my head at night.The Harmonies,the weird sounds,This record is a Classic.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is a wonderful retelling of the timeless story of good versus evil - of the hero who acts not for his own advantage but for the good of all.<br />Maximus is a WARRIOR - a brilliant example of this hero archetype, a man who wants nothing more than to live happily with his own family, but is called by destiny to serve the good of the nation.<br />When his emperor calls upon him to take the helm of the government, Maximus is reluctant and refuses, but then villain makes the choice for him, by destroying all Maximus held dear.  He is lost for a time, but his Warrior spirit will not let him succumb tot eh temptation to join in family in the Elysian fields.  He has a job to do, an empire to serve.  Only when the job is done will he have earned his rest.<br />In short -- it's a great movie.  See it today!
B000002UDB|5.0|Though the Beatles didn't intend for it to be an album (CD)Magical Mystery Tour has got to be one of their greatest.Despite the fact that the film was not a critical success, the album &quot;soundtrack&quot; was an enormous hit at the time of its original 1967 release.Coming hot on the heels of Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, this album quite possibly rivals it.Just look at the songs.Some of Lennon's best psychedelia &quot;Strawberry Field's Forever&quot; &quot;I am the Walrus&quot; and the eternal flower power anthem &quot;All You Need is Love&quot; are represented here, as well as McCartney's exquisite&quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; and the mini-symphonic &quot;Penny Lane.&quot; Not to mention the cunningly complex but highly commercial&quot;Hello Goodbye.&quot; Even the&quot;minor songs&quot; like the title cut and &quot;Baby, You're a Rich Man&quot; give today's dreck a run for it's money.Seven of these songs are represented on the Beatles Blue 1967-70.This is Lennon's personal favorite because &quot;it's crazy and weird.&quot; Absolutely a creative peak.
0780623134|5.0|I am always moved by movies that have perfect endings, and this defines &quot;Perfect Ending&quot;.  I have always loved Steven King, and this movie was based on his best novella ever.  I was so surprised, because all of the movies that my mom recommends to me out romantic-comedies, and I hate those movies.  This movie was one that I decided to watch for the first time by myself.  The last thing my mom told me before I escaped to my room to watch it was &quot;Enjoy&quot;, and then a pleasant smile.  Ever since, it has been my all-time favorite movie, by far, and one that has no flaws.  Words cannot do justice to this film, but I just think that it is a true pleasure to be totally satisfied after watching a movie.  The acting was great, the cinematography was outstanding, the musical score was perfect, the direction was awesome, and the movie straight out ruled.  I will never like another movie more than I like this one.  It is just too bad that the critics are too cynical and have no real feelings for movies, otherwise this would have swept the 1994 Oscars.  I believe that it should have won all of the major awards.  When a friend asks me to recommend a good movie, I always just reply with three words, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;
B00004YKUX|5.0|certainly there is a pathos attached to this cd, a degenerative disease attacking Cash, and many of the songs dealing with the idea of dying, being alone, hanging tough, etc.  But certainly this is an irony that Cash can play with.  Here is one of the nations toughest performers, a mixture of religion,violence, and love that just is so uniquely him.  And after one listen I was sold. The first two cuts set the tone for a spare,solitary production...but the treats for me hang with I see a darkness...a truly dark and fabulous work, and the mercy seat.  I don't do analytical reviews.  I know what I like.  This is a cd to cherish for the songs.  In the liner notes Johnny says the song is everything.  I would agree.  This is a cd to listen to and respect.  Much like the artist himself.

B00002R0MC|5.0|Disc #2, Track #6...enough said.  That acoustic medley of Bob teaching tunes to Johnny Nash is the finest piece of music I have ever heard recorded.
B000000993|5.0|I'm a huge tool fan and i can't even put into words how much their music means to me.  They are by far the best band out there right now a lot better than all of those rapmetal and numetal bands which I used to like but after hearing tool all of that stuff plain sucks.  I'm also a guitarist and i have to say that Adam Jones is one of the best out there because he uses a very unique style much like Tom Morello of Rage.  They also have one the best drummers around in Danny Carey and no doubt the best vocalist in Maynard.  This albulm is probably their best because it combines the raw emotion of their first albulm opiate with the complexness of aenima.  The best songs on the albulm even though they are all great are Flood, 4 degrees, bottom, prison sex, and sober.  My favorites are flood and bottom because both have great emotion to them.  If you want a band that only cares about making great music and isn't just a bunch of phonies up on stage rapping then definetly check out tool.  Also check out Pink Floyd, Rush, Alice in chains, Nirvana, Rage, and Metallica.
B0000508U6|2.0|Bought the CD because I liked &quot;Yellow&quot;.  Listened to the other tracks and was surprisingly disappointed.  The short songs with depressing lyrics are not worth the expense.
0140177396|5.0|&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; will always stick out in my mind as a one of a kind book.  It is unfogettable in so many ways.  I first read this book in 8th grade and loved it.  I then read it again in 9th grade and loved it twice as much the second time around.             The characters in the book, George and Lenny are complete opposites, yet at the same time they are a pair.  They are both outsiders who need eachother in their hard times and good times.  Lenny, being not quite as intellegent as George, goes through a lot.  He depends on his friend George to back him up whenever he does something wrong.  George on the otherhand is independent.  As said before they are completly different people, but in a sense the same.       The main story line is very interesting.  It has many twists and turns that are completly unexpected.  There are some times in the story you will need to pick up a box of tissues and others when you will just laugh.  It is an all around great book.  I could not put it down, it took me only but a few hours to read the whole thing.  And even after you are finished reading you could sit there thinking about what the book actually means for hours at a time.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is in the mood to enjoy an easy read, but yet at the same time a book that has meaning.
0684853523|3.0|I've been reading Stephen King's books for years...as, I guess has almost everyone else! So I couldn't pass up this book, with the intriguing title &quot;on writing&quot;: a chance to take a peak into the mind of the writer whose books I've followed for so long! A chance --maybe!-- to get an answer to the question: where the hell does he get all his ideas? <br />Of course, after finishing the book, I still don't know where he gets his ideas, or why...I don't get equally interesting ideas! The fact remains: talent has a lot to do with it, &amp; many people have tried to explain talent, to translate it into other things, like hard work, having read a lot or whatever. Talent remains a great mystery, &amp; if you've got it, you've got it. If not...well, however many books about writing you read, tough: you won't be able to get this gift, this mysterious ability that is talent.<br />On the other hand, one thing I found very interesting in Stephen King's book, is that there exists an equation, sort of. Here's how it goes: people who write badly will never be able to write well. People who write well will never be able to write beautifully. BUT (&amp; that's a big but!)people who are competent in writing, who can write fairly well, will probably be able to learn how to write well, with a lot of hard work. And of course if they develop a style, follow some rules, not fall into traps, whatever. Stephen King gives some pointers, some ideas &amp; rules about writing in this book, which seemed mostly sensible to me. Although some of them seemed a little obvious, &amp; those were the parts of the book I didn't enjoy so much.<br />But what I found most interesting about &quot;On writing&quot; were the autobiographical parts, the parts that show us how King started writing, a little about his family life, a little about his character &amp; his weaknesses &amp; strengths...this all explained a lot to me about the writer of books I've loved such as &quot;Four past midnight&quot; or&quot;The dead Zone&quot; or &quot;Misery&quot;. Especially &quot;Misery&quot;...he tells us quite a lot about the writing process of that one, &amp; it's all very interesting. In the end, I felt very sad reading about Stephen King's accident, &amp; also --once again-- I felt amazed by the way he can take us right to the exact location of whatever he's describing...in this case, the scene of his almost-fatal accident. <br />In a nutshell, this book is good for long-time readers of Stephen King. I'm not sure it's quite as good for people who want to read / learn about writing, as it says mostly things that have been said before. But in no way is this book uninteresting, or not worth reading. Even these things that you've heard before are well written, well explained &amp; all in all worth taking a look at.
B000002J1Y|4.0|Frankly, Yes's symphonic style of music was never going to be best recorded live.  It depended on precise, virtuoso performances, and the occasional overdub, and the clarity of Jon Anderson's voice.  This is not to deny that a Yes concert was a visually and musically thrilling evening.  It's just that if you weren't there, you'd prefer the immaculate studio recording to the grubby concert sound.<br />This is no 'Made in Japan', another major live album of the time.  On the basis of this recording, Jon Anderson doesn't interact with the audience to anything like the extent that Ian Gillan manipulates his Japanese fans.  Some of the tracks, particularly of the then-more-recent tunes such as 'Siberian Khatru' are virtually identical, note-for-note, to the studio versions.<br />Jon Anderson's voice stands up remarkably well.  Alan White, who had only just joined, did a great job in learning so many songs so quickly.  (His predecessor Bill Bruford appears on only three tracks here.)<br />The packaging reproduces all the original Roger Dean art, but again neglects to say where these concerts were recorded.<br />'Yessongs' originally appeared on 3 LPs, which meant it needed six interventions to listen to the entire performance.  On 2 CDs, I only need get get up to my CD player twice!  Although quite a desirable package, it never got to the top of the UK album charts.  In those days, there were few 'greatest hits' albums, and live albums plugged that gap.  But Yessongs was priced at £4.99, which seemed a slightly expensive way of buying sub-studio quality recordings from the three albums from which these tracks are taken -- 'Yes Album', 'Fragile' and 'Close to the Edge' -- each of which retailed at £2.45.<br />'Yessongs' is really quite good, but I would point the Yes novice first at 'Close to the Edge' or the ensemble tunes on 'Fragile'.
B00004XONN|3.0|I put this review off for a while, hoping I would develop some kind of concrete opinion on this album in time. I kept waiting for something in the music to hit me, and tell me, &quot;This is brilliant music that is way ahead of its time!&quot;. Alas, it never happened, and I now don't expect it to happen. If it does, though, I'll be sure to write another review. My only concrete opinion on the album at this point is that its different, and perhaps strange. I'll try to sort out my feelings on the album.<br />First, as an avid listener of electronic artists of varying fame, I would like to address the use of electronic instruments in this music. I don't feel like this resembles &quot;techno&quot;, or at least what I consider to be techno. What I hear in &quot;Kid A&quot; is the integration of electronic instruments into alternative rock. This integration is probably more prevalent than most bands that have adopted this &quot;fad&quot;. The song structures are generally still traditional. Its the presentation and instrumentation that has changed. Some will disagree with me because of the strange rhythms and other different elements. I can only say that this does not resemble any electronic music that i listen to or have heard before. Maybe this will explain it better: If I had a craving for electronic music, I would not pull out &quot;Kid A&quot;. I would pull out FSOL or Autechre. I would pull out &quot;Kid A&quot; if I had a craving for creative rock. Of the ten tracks, I only feel comfortable calling seven of them songs. The opener, I thought, was very disappointing, compared to past albums (Airbag, Planet Telex). There's no real driving rhythm or pleasant melody. The title track is a little better, but still perplexing. The vocal effects are goofy and annoying to me. If you're gonna use vocals, give 'em to me straight up, not messed up beyond recognition. Its kind of a waste of a voice, I guess. Track 3 is a little more traditional sounding, but after a while it gets repetative and boring.  Track 4 is subdued and enjoyable, while track 5 is pure ambience. 6 is my favorite, and the climax of the album if there is one. The melodies and rhythms keep me interested here. 7, though repetative, is strangely fascinating. 8 is the one people are labeling as &quot;techno&quot;. If you listen to it and think, though, any of the sounds could be replaced by traditional instruments, and it would sound like a fairly normal song. Its not techno. Its a good song though. 9 is remeniscent of 7 in its repetition, but not quite as attractive. 10 is confusing, and lacks finality. I don't like when artists do this. Overall, the album lacks the unification of their past albums. When I listen to it, I feel like I'm missing something. Sometimes when I listen to my less favorite songs, I'll think, &quot;What were you trying to say when you made this song? What makes this song enjoyable?&quot;. This album leaves me feeling desolate and excluded. I guess Radiohead learned a new language that I don't understand.
B000002J1H|4.0|Hipgnosis really pushed the boat out for this cover, featuring probably the best male bottom to appear on a 1970s rock album.  It almost ranked with the female article appearing on Robert Palmer's 'Pressure Drop'.  The only question it raised was: where was Roger Dean?<br />Music-wise, this album had enough on it to keep happy the fans who chose to ignore what was really energising popular music at the time, i.e. punk and US disco.  'Parallels' was the stand-out track, featuring the returned beer-swilling Rick Wakeman on a great church organ.  In fact, this is probably Rick's finest album for Yes.  Maybe Moraz had opened up a few new possibilities for keyboards with Yes.  It was clear that Wakeman hadn't learned some lessons.  It wasn't as if his 'King Arthur on Ice' solo project had failed dismally.<br />Over half the people who buy this CD have already owned it in some format -- cassette, LP or unremastered CD -- so it matters little what I write about it.  It's a good-ish album, but it will win few new converts.
0812589041|5.0|While Ender's Game is set in a futuristic world, I honestly feel that the essence of the book lies not in science fiction. The story works because of its focus on the characters. Whether you care for science fiction or not, you will care for (or, in some cases, despise) every character in the book. <br />For younger readers, they may feel as if they 'are' Ender. The novel has incredible power when read from that perspective. Yet this is not a novel just for the young. For others, this can offer a window into a gifted child's life. You will be able to see the joys, and personal hells that gifted children experience.<br />In short, this novel is for almost anyone. Whether a sci-fi fan or not, and whether you are young or old; this novel can be enjoyed by all.

Apparently, they got heat for doing a &quot;rock&quot; version of it by some purists.  This follows &quot;Toccota&quot;, a variation on a piano concerto by Alberto Ginastera.  Their rendition features lots of eerie sounds from Keith's keyboards and Carl playing drums with computerized gadgetry.  ELP were way ahead of their times back in 1973!  This cut almost didn't make the album, as they had to pay a personal visit to the composer Ginastera who complimented this piece by declaring it &quot;diabolic&quot;!  &quot;Still You Turn Me On&quot; is a nice acoustic track by Greg and features him on a wah-wah pedal.  &quot;Benny the Bouncer&quot; is a cute vaudevillian number about a big bully who messes with the wrong guy and features some fine honkey tonk piano by Keith.  <br />&quot;Karn Evil 9&quot; is a 3 part suite which features some lyrical help from Peter Sinfield (a King Cimson alumnist).  The 1st Impression Part 1 starts out with promise (&quot;I will be there, to heal your sorrow, to beg and borrow&quot;) and winds up in spectacle (moving onto Part 2, which many of you know as &quot;Welcome Back My Friends to the Show that Never Ends&quot;).  The 2nd Impression is a Latino jazz piece (piano and steel drums).  In the 3rd Impression, computers have taken over society (&quot;Load your program, I am yourself&quot;) and are seen as Big Brother.  It's funny how true their prophecy has become! <br />If you've never heard this masterpiece in its entirety, you're in for a big surprise!
B00004XONN|5.0|OK- i've read all the reviews and Im sick of all the bitching that comes with being a radiohead fan, either your defending their influence- knocking it down- or going on about the hidden meaning of the albums!   All i have to say is that I am NOT a radiohead fan and this album BLEW MY MIND AWAY.  Its is the most incredible album to come out now and.. well i believe that it will make its way into rock and roll history.  This is deffinately the most completely incredible in everyway album i have heard in a long time.  Its up there with the Beatles White album (though better becuase even the white album has lacking tracks), Iggy Pop's The Idiot, Lou Reeds Coney Island Baby, The Stones Let it Bleed, Richard Hells Bank Generation and more!      When i put this album on i can't shut it off!  I recommend it to everyone- its making music history.
6300215512|5.0|When you start the movie and the good guy is face down in the pool, well you now this ain't no Disney movie.  This movie starts dark and ends with a chill.  Pay attention to the naration.  Usually naration is bad thing, hear it will make the story.  A crazy, desparate woman trying to maintain her youth and her hopes of being a star again clings on to a man years her younger.  Holden playing a roten dirty man looking for a bcuk play the part of &quot;boy toy&quot; well, till his own desire for self respect gets in the way.  Then Bam, Bam face down in the pool. When Norma Desmond comes down the stairs &quot;I'm ready for my close up Mr. Demil.&quot; the hair will stand up on your neck.  This one is a keeper.
B00004R99I|3.0|Pocahontas is a more serious Disney, that is good in the first viewing.
0380788624|4.0|A combination of &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot;-lite and a Tom Clancy thriller, Stephenson's Cryptonomicon succeeds on several levels.  First, the book is simply fun to read.  Stephenson has his own quirky style, which may put off some readers, but which I found enjoyable.  Spending a couple of pages reading about the proper way to eat Captain Crunch was not a waste of time!  For me, this book was a page turner.  Second, I found this book to actually be reasonably informative.  I came out of it with a better understanding of both cryptography (historically and modern), and a little more knowledge about WWII.  Third, the characters, while a bit stereotypical, were generally quite likable.<br />The book wasn't perfect - the moral issues were a bit too black and white, and the book was longer than necessary.  I found these flaws to be minor, and would recommend this book to any sci-fi fan.
0553278398|4.0|I remember as a kid reading the Foundation trilogy and being *so angry* about Asimov's literary &quot;dirty trick&quot; of revealing at the end that two characters that have previously been introduced in the book are actually the *same person*!  When I read a book, I play a &quot;movie&quot; in my mind, so I could actually &quot;see&quot; those two characters, and they were clearly two different people, so to claim at the end that they were the same person seemed SO UNFAIR to me!  Now as a (much older) reader, I read Prelude, and unsuspectingly DARNED IF HE DIDN'T PULL THE SAME TRICK ON ME!  This is probably childish, and I should get over it, but now I've got it off my chest, and I feel so much better!  :)   Yes, I do recommend this book, the series, and anything by Asimov.
B00003CWL6|5.0|If you haven't yet had a chance to see Amercian Beauty, get it today.<br />This is clearly the best movie out of Hollywood in years, and was absolutely worthy of its Best Picture win at the Oscars.<br />While almost everyone I know who saw this movie loved it, there were a few women who had mixed feelings.<br />I think this is because many women don't like being depicted at the &quot;bad guy&quot;.<br />Throughout much of this movie, the Kevin Spacey character seems to be the one to blame, but he turns out the hero, while his wife, played superbly by Annette Benning, shows us her true nature.<br />The music is great, the acting is top-notch, the story is original, the cinematography is stunning.<br />Take my advice: this movie is WELL worth your time.
B000009CEM|5.0|A society of decay and chaos, ruled by machines, constantly undermined by  human resistance. Sounds familiar? Sure is....almost Terminator, the movie, with a slight change in plans. This is a good concept album, a journey of a rebel discovering his fear and strength in a never ending battle against his mechanical tormentors, and finally discovering a neglected saviour in his hour of defeat. This is no happy ending saga. &quot;Timelessness&quot; is a brooding song...slow and melancholic, like a bleeding heart. It's a story of woe in itself, as Edgecrusher (the central character in this concept CD), laments in despair over the wastrel loss of humanity he has seen with his own eyes. This album has its brutal and numbing moments in songs like &quot;Shock&quot;, &quot;Edgecrusher&quot;, &quot;Securitron-Police State 2000&quot;, &quot;Freedom or Fire&quot;, &quot;Smasher/Devourer&quot;, and the best song of this CD &quot;Resurrection&quot;. Another thing that does not go unnoticeable is the splendid futuristic artwork...a glimpse of a futuristic hell. Read along the sleeve as you play this CD....you may wake up 50 years in the future.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|OK war flick about a mythical spy mission. Nothing that great but serviceable
B000001DV2|5.0|No matter what anyone thinks, Andrenalize is Def Leppards best album. Not only because it contain some of Steve (Steamin) Clarks last material before his January 1991 death but also because its just one of those albums where the words are stuck in your head after only one time through. The next best album to Adrenalize would have to be the album that broke through the best band in the world,and that album is Pyromania, Yeah Hysteria was good but that was like the appetizer to the full course which is called Adrenalize
B00003CXE7|3.0|It was quite a spectacle; I'll give it that.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is an excellent movie to have in anyone's DVD collection.  I have X-Men on DVD as well and I like Gladiator over X-Men because of the terrific storyline.  Be warned:  I wouldn't let young children watch this movie because it has some very gory scenes (like Saving Private Ryan) but this makes the movie very realistic.  Also, if your DVD player and receiver have DTS decoding, watch (and hear) this movie in DTS surround (especially the scene where Maximus is fighting the other gladiator with the tigers coming from the ground).  All hail Maximus!!
6305127697|5.0|Excellent court flick. Gere is great as the smug, know it all attorney. Ed Norton is fantastic, and the whole cast is excellent. Plenty of surprises! I loved it!
B00003CXGP|4.0|This was a wonderful film that satirized rich, white, republican life in the late 80's, and accomplished it's goal with gusto! The film itself is very dark and well, psychotic. But there is something about the dialogue that makes you laugh. There are many lines in this movie that are downright hysterical. Most of them I can't say in this review because they are too adult-oriented. But I will say &quot;Don't just stare at it, Eat it!&quot;      The performances in this film were very memorable. Christian Bale is an actor whose career I will watch with great interest. Reese Witherspoon is funny and sarcastic as ever. Jared Leto did okay but his most memorable scene was his death scene. The rest of the cast was fine but the true star of this film is Christian Bale.      The film is great and worthy of 5 stars. But it does not have enough special features to make it a 5 star DVD. If youre looking for something to rent at the video store than pick this up. But don't buy it unless you are a big movie collector.
B00003CXE7|4.0|To play DVD with Computer, you can use PowerDVD. It's small, easy and powerfull. You don't need &quot;PC Friendly&quot; software. You can even play DVD with other Region too.

B00002Z88D|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME C-D! I WANTED TO GO TO THIS CONCERT SO BAD! BUT I COULDEN'T GET MONEY! BUT I WENT AND GOT THE ALBUM AND IT ROCKS! IT STARTS OUT WITH A NICE LITTLE NUMBER FROM THE SYMPHONY AND GOES INTO AN AWESOME SONG FROM  METALLICA AND RIGHT INTO &quot;MASTER OF PUPPETS&quot;!! THEY HOLD NOTHING BACK. IF YOUR A METALLIFAN YOU GOTTA OWN THIS.
B00004X01U|3.0|Madonna's new Album is another notch down from her previous albums.  I love Madonna's true voice, and not a techno replacement. I felt Ray of light was acceptable, but Music just went too far.  No more albums like this Madonna, Please! I continue to listen to all her old albums, and wish she could go back and produce those type.  If any of you seen her on the Live Internet Concert on MSN, you will quickly observe how much more enjoyable her old songs were when she privledged the audience with those songs.
B000050FEN|5.0|&quot;Seven&quot; is a great film, a true masterpiece. The film really has 3 plots.  The 1st being 2 cops tracking down a serial killer who has killed his victims according to the 7 deadly sins.  The second plot is about the growth of the relationship between the 2 officers who do not trust each other or like each other, yet are connected by their devotion for the capture of the killer.  Now, the 2 know that this is no ordinary case, and they know it is going to take a lot more than guns and fingerprints to track down this killer.  The third plot is how they know that the killer is more than just the average Joe, that this guy picks his victims with no remorse and no sense.  The cops know that the person they are tracking is not someone wo will leave a fingerprint at the scene, but they know that this person truly is evil, and they know that they can't win.  They know that in order to capture this guy, they must dive into his mind, and try to figure out what makes this guy click.           Besides the above information, this is a very tough, gory, brutal, and violent film.  This film exceeds the violent content of &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; and the very shocking, horrifing conclusion will leave you breatheless and exhausted.  A great film with outstanding performances
0399146253|1.0|I have read every Patricia Cornwell/Kay Scarpetta novel and each one has gotten increasingly worse.  Last Precinct never got better from start to finish.  There is little plot or character development.  Disappointment in Ms. Cornwell's efforts is only surpassed by a feeling of disappointment that this author's work has so deteriorated that she does not feel the need to give her readers a fair return for their dollar.  Shame on you Ms. Cornwell.  This will be the last book of yours that I purchase.  You are cerainly resting on your laurels and they have run out!
0671578855|5.0|My favorite of all the Vorkosigan novels, in this installment Miles focuses his strategems on the wooing of a lovely young widow. Who else but Bujold could endow a dinner party with the excitment and panash of interstellar conflict? Witty and enjoyable from cover to cover!
B00000IAU3|4.0|I can't believe that alot of people like this album, I thought that it would be completely overlooked. I am glad to see that I was wrong. Its not perfect but it comes close.
0880793589|5.0|<BR>    The Creative Wack Pack consists of 64 cards each focusing on a different creativity principle. The 64 cards are divided into four sixteen card suits: Explorer, Artist, Judge, and Warrior. These represent the four roles or types of thinking of the creative process. <BR> <BR>     The Explorer is your role for discovering the resources you'll use to create new ideas. The cards in the Explorer suit highlight places and ways to find new information. <BR> <BR>     The Artist is your role for transforming your resources into new ideas. The cards in the Artist suit provide you with idea-generating techniques. <BR> <BR>     The Judge is your role for evaluating an idea and deciding what to do with it. The cards in the Judge suit lend decision making advice. <BR> <BR>     The Warrior is your role for implementing your idea. The cards in the Warrior suit give you the &quot;kick&quot; you need to get your ideas into action. <BR> <BR>    There are several ways the cards can be used. One of the best is the &quot;Creative Licencing at Meetings&quot;. At the beginning of a meeting, deal out five cards to each participant. The cards give each person permission to make a point related to that card as you work though the meeting agenda. A participant may play a card at any time if he or she feels thtat its message will help the meeting. <BR> <BR>    Some examples of cards:<BR> <BR> Card #27 - CHANGE ITS NAME - If a architect looks at an opening between two rooms and thinks &quot;door&quot; that's what she will design. But if she thinks &quot;passageway&quot;, she may design something much different like a &quot;hallway&quot;, &quot;air curtain&quot;, &quot;tunnel&quot;, or perhaps a &quot;courtyard&quot;. Different words bring in different assumptions and lead your thinking in different directions. What else can you call your idea? <BR> <BR> Card #9 - USE A RANDOM IDEA - Open your mind up to things that have nothing to do with the idea you're developing. Pick out the third word on p.134 of your dictionary - &quot;broom&quot;. How does it relate to what you are doing? What similiarities does it have with your idea?  Can you use it as a metaphor? Look out your window and find the first thing that has blue in it - &quot;mailbox&quot;. How does it shed light on your idea? What random idea can you use to stimulate your thinking? <BR>
B00004XONN|4.0|I like it. It is very different from their other CDs but in some ways but it still sounds very much like Radiohead. I'm glad some musicians try to do something innovative rather than &quot;go for the cash&quot;.
B00004NRWH|5.0|I never took a notice or care in foreign artists before, but Nickelback (a farely popular Canadian band just entering into the US) has persuaded me to start noticing. If their are any other foreign artists HALF as good as Nickelback is, I'll buy them! This album is superb. It's alternative rock with a very clear acoustic/electric sound. Nickelback has a mix of Fuel, A Perfect Circle, and Three Doors Down but still doesn't carry one recycled quality in its bones. It is an alternative rock band with a VERY original sound. Although there are only 11 tracks to this album, every one is a GREAT song. I have had this album for a couple months now and I still jam to it almost every day, beginning to end. Nickelback will always be one of my favorite bands whether they make it big here in the states or not (it would be a CRYING shame if they didn't). GET THIS ALBUM. You WON'T regret it. Tell your friends about it.
B000050XEI|5.0|How can I possibly describe it?  I grew up listening to Enya.  You're probably wondering how, as her first cd came out in 1988.  Well, I'm twelve.  So that answers your question.  But, anyway, I love her music.  Enya makes the kind of music where, when you listen to it, with no distractions, and close your eyes, everything else kind of dissolves and you're caught in this silken web of ecstasy.  Okay, you prabably think i'm insane.  If you've listened to it, you understand.  If you haven't, listen to it and you will.  That's enough for now. (look out for siver inches and wild child.)
1569382603|5.0|I watched this series on public television recently and it totally blew me away. How did certain ancient cultures have mathematical knowledge that we didn't have until the 20th century? What's going on with the astronomical alignment of the Egyptian monuments? Why do the mathematical configurations of the pyramids EXACTLY match monuments in South America? And the most freaky question: why did all of these ancient cultures claim they learned this astronomical and mathematical knowledge from the Winged Dragon? I'm telling you, I started calling friends while I was watching. Believe me, it was one of the most entrancing television series I have EVER watched. I don't often feel like I need to own a video but this one I feel I'll watch over and over again. This guy is a genius. You will learn stuff that will blow your mind.

0783226152|4.0|This film has a little bit of everything in it.  The acting is  great - Richard Dreyfus is superb.  The cars are fantastic and the soundtrack is practically unbeatable.<br />The story is about how four school friends spend their last night in town before going off (or not as the case may be) to live the rest of the their lives.<br />Often funny, sometimes sad, but always very watchable.  If you love class acting, the film's a must; if you love classic American cars, the film's a must and if you love rock n'roll why are you still reading this - you should be watching the film!<br />Any Harrison Ford fans out there should keep an eye out for him as the man in the cowboy hat who's out to beat one of the four guys in a road race.
0553106635|5.0|In my humble opinion, Martin is the best author of fantasy going today.<br />For those who haven't started this series yet: &quot;Public Service Announcment: The first book is Game of Thrones&quot;.<br />I cannot recommend this book more strongly. Martin's writting style is so fresh compared to the cliched plots and storylines that are out there. Each chapter is told from a different engaging point of view. Each character is both heroic and villainous--following their own logical motivations. In fact, these are the most believable characters that I have ever read in a fantasy novel. As for the plot, it is unpredictable. Martin kept me guessing throughout the entire book. My only regret is that the book wasn't longer. I could have easily read another 1000 pages.
6304535570|4.0|First off, I have to disagree with the 'official' critic in regards to this story.  It's a wonderful piece of escapism, pure and simple and as such, it's a great film.<br />Although the Simon Templar we see in the film isn't the one we've come to recognise through the literature and other movies, he is still a very likeable character in his own right.<br />A master of disguise, thief and all round ladies man, Simon Templar takes a job to steal the formula for cold fusion from a  professor so that he can retire on the money that he'll make from the job.<br />All goes well until he meets the professor and finds her to be a young beautiful woman.  He falls for her and decides not to steal the formula from her but the person who hired him threatens to kill her if he doesn't complete the job as planned.<br />So, he takes the formula and from then on he does his best to keep one jump ahead of everyone using high tech equipment and pure good luck as well as trying to stop the cold fusion formula getting into the wrong hands.<br />Does he get the girl?  The ending will not disappoint.<br />There are three steps to becoming a saint - he may falter along the way but eventually he takes them.  Great piece of evening's entertainment after a hard at work when you just want relax.
0679879269|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books of this series, and while there were some nice moments in &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; there were also some extremely poor choices made by the author.<br />The major flaw with these books was not the War in Heaven struggling against the Authority (I actually thought the use of the subtle knife in this scene was clever and well done).<br />The problem was the sudden change in Lyra's parents. Their 180 degree turn from the previous books was extremely bad characterization. Sadly, the author chose to make his plot hinge on the unrealistic motivations of these characters.<br />Despite that, I found the ending very moving.<br />I have mixed feelings about &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;. If Pullman would have made the change in his antagonists believable this would be a 5 star reccomendation. Unfortunately, he didn't. The series thus has failed to reach its true potential.
B00001ODHF|4.0|This third part of the Evil Dead trilogy moves further away from the scare factor of the first and leans more towards comedy - it doesn't miss out on it's fair share of blood, guts and Deadites though!<br />Ash is back, meaner, more sarcastic and even more ticked off than ever.  Thrown back in time to the Medieval ages, he soon becomes embroiled in a war with the Deadites and has to deal once again with the Necronemicon, the Book of the Dead.<br />Add to that the fact that he ends up fighting his evil self, who leads the Deaite forces and you've got yourself a fun filled, sometimes scarey but very funny film which ends on a twist.<br />You don't need to have watched the other two films either as this stands well on it's own.<br />So, if like to have a good night's entertainment but want to watch something a little out of the ordinary then choose this - you won't go wrong.
B000002W5J|5.0|JEFFERSON AIRPLANE'S second album is a classic rock album ,that started the second wave of CALIFORNIAN rock that melts itself in psychadelic delights.Like THE DOORS, that group had a great start, but managed somehow to let things go later on.The drug scene was one of the reason-WHITE RABBIT is of course a LSD trip-but the whole record has a coherent approach showing original writing in terms of word and music that is truely rewarding.It would be a great mistake to listen to this record only once ,because repeated listenings make it better.One tune is clearly showing a SIMON AND GARFUNKEL influence.Find out by yourself
0525945636|4.0|Follett regains his footing with this taut hard-to-put down thriller. He sets the pace at breakneck speed and doesn't pull back. The only regret about the Cold War ending is the lack of a great subject for thriller writers such as Follet, Forsythe and Le Carre.  Follett reaches back to that time period to create one of his better novels in recent years.
B000002I25|5.0|Although MORRISSON HOTEL is worth checking out,their first album was by far their best.LIGHT MY FIRE and THE END are so well known they don't need presentation;BACK DOOR MAN is perfect for JIM;TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX is a good satirist song that makes fun of movie moguls.THE DOORS were JIM MORRISSON'S group all the way;when he ended up in all kinds of excesses ,the group felt apart and sadly declined.In their last album,JIM'S voice was simply unrecognizable.One of rock's true quick downfall, but at that time, he was not the only one.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  While haveing hints of romance, it doesn't distract from the action or story of the movie.  Great special effects, but you've probably already heard that.  Just too many good points to list here.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy this one.  You'll enjoy it over and over.
B00004XONN|3.0|This latest album is good, but not great.  Aphex Twin already has produced this music already, time and time again- especially songs like Treefingers.  OK Computer was far more original than this.  That said, this is still a good CD, haunting and ghostlike in it's approach.  It kind of dances around you like a phantom, instead of punishing you like &quot;The Bends&quot;.  It surrounds you like a lingering echo instead of poking you like &quot;OK Computer&quot;.<br />OK Computer is one of the top ten best CD's in the 1990's.  Lets leave it at that.  If you are just getting into Radiohead, try Computer before this one.
B00003CX7L|4.0|Where this movie has a good story and is enjoyable to watch, I was expecting more humor that an adult could enjoy too.  I liked it, it just was TOO much for children.  Maybe my memory is a little rusty, but I remembered the first Toy Story to have more humor for adults.  But, if you have kids, this is the one for you.  They'll love it.
B00004XPP0|2.0|I recently got the Trilogy and first thing I wanted to see was the preview of Episode 2 in which was so I thoght gonna be good. Boy was I wrong. It showed a quick inerview of Gorge Lucus and a C-3PO's voice Anthony Daniels. That was It. It was so bad I could have puked. Man I'm the sucker for buying it. Please forgive me when I say that it was poor. For as rich as Geroge Lucus is I would have thought that he would make the preview better then this
B000002GB6|5.0|The Grammy winning title cut &quot;Feels so Good&quot; is what turned me on to Chuck Mangione's music.  But this CD goes much further than that.  ALL of the recordings here are excellent.  And they are arranged alternating the fast and slow pieces in a pleasing way.  &quot;Maui Waui&quot; and &quot;Last Dance&quot; are nice and relaxing.  &quot;Theme from Side Street&quot; is short but meaningful.  &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; is a catchy piece that will have you tapping to it.  And &quot;The XIth Commandment&quot; is a brilliant end to this great CD.  <br />This is by far Chuck's best recording.  If you're in a qundary about which Chuck Mangione CD to buy, THIS IS THE ONE!
0375703764|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read, and I have read alot.  This is a complicated book that requires complex thoughts, thus making this a book that is not for everybody.  However, the way it is written makes it one of the best horror books ever written.<br />The plot, about an ever-growing house, seems mundane, but with his tricks, and words, the becomes better than what it generally would be.  But, the words will get to you to affect you.  It will get under your skin, and make you second guess realit, for a little while.  But, isn't that what a good book should do?  Yhis is a great example of how books should be.
B000001G16|5.0|Despite an awkward opener called &quot;Rest In Peace&quot; Richie Sambora's first solo record showed as much depth and personality as his co-horts higher profile solo effort. Sambora's as good a tunesmith as JBJ and &quot;Stranger&quot; is full of great songs like the title track and &quot;One Light Burning.&quot; The songs walk that line between what Bon Jovi was perceived as being and what Richie Sambora was trying to become as a musician, A little bit more bluesy and a bit more heartfelt.<br />The last two numbers, a sort of epic called &quot;Father Time&quot; and an acoustic piece called &quot;The Answer&quot; are equal to any songs on any Bon Jovi records. One can't help but wonder if Jon ever wished Richie had saved them for him. <br />Anyone who enjoys good rock and roll will love this album.
078062999X|5.0|This is the definitive version of the Bard's great play.  Branaugh as Hamlet is a little over the top but only fuddy-duddy scholars will tell you that Shakesphere was supposed to be subtle.  The man wrote melodrama!  It was magnificent, insightful melodrama, of course, but that's what it was.  Willy Shakes should be performed at a higher pitch than, say, a Tom Stoppard play.<br />Jacobi brings a depth to Claudius lacking in most productions (the man is brilliant when playing characters by that name).  Winslet is heartbreaking in this role (far better than that ship movie she was in a year later).  Richard Briers is perfect as Polonious, the Prime Minister out his depth.  Heston's performance reminds you that they didn't hand out Oscars for *Ben Hur* just for perfect attendance.<br />I will not buy this movie on VHS, however.  The idea of watching this beautiful 70mm production on tape is almost sacreligious.  I will just have to wait for the DVD version (Henry V is out, so get it going, Ken!).  It's either that or buy a new laserdisc player just to watch the copy I already own...
B000002AH7|4.0|Anyone interested in Miles but wary of classical music doesn't have to worry about this album.  Of all the Davis / Evans collaborations, &quot;Sketches Of Spain&quot; is certainly the most realized.  The combination of Evans' orchestra, incessant latin percussion, and Miles' bright trumpet make for an album of light, fancy Spanish styles appropriated into a classical manner.  The strong melodies give way to emotions &amp; ideas that are never vague - sadness, fear, discovery, melancholy and happiness.  Miles' horn is much brighter and high in pitch (in many places) than normally found on his albums.  His playing is constant, yet Miles never seems to be over-taking the orchestra behind him.  The orchestra itself never gives into full-blown theatrics, Evans mostly makes use of sharp horns while the strings lay down a gentle background.  This record is equal parts classical and Spanish; the only true trace of jazz is Miles' himself, who never strays far from the orchestra's arrangement.  In the long career of Miles Davis, this album is another strong reminder that Miles' was a musician who welcomed change and was NEVER afraid to experiment.<br />A funny thing about this album is how much it resembles film scores of 60's musicals.  Many of the different marches &amp; vamps on this album resemble bits of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, which can be expected given both have latin roots to them.  For Miles' classical work, this isn't as headstrong as &quot;Porgy &amp; Bess&quot; or as introspective as &quot;Quiet Nights&quot;.  If you're ready to sample Miles' orchestral efforts, this is the simplest &amp; most engaging place to start.
B00004XONN|2.0|I know everyone likes a little experimental rock now and then, but this album was experimental for eperimental's sake. Radiohead has forgotten that it's all about good music, not just being rock pioneers.  I was disappointed with the album as a whole, although there are some good tracks (motion picture soundtrack,everything in its right place).  I like radiohead just as much as anyone, but the credit they are given as &quot;rock saviors&quot; and best band ever is just hopping on the radiohead bandwagon.  I will hop on as soon as they remember how to make good music like i know they can.
6303921248|5.0|I can't help myself - I just love this version of Pride and Prejudice. It has stunningly beautiful sets and scenes, it just seems to glow with vitality and vigour.<br />I love most of the actors in their character parts - Mrs Bennet and Mr Collins are just stand-outs with Lady Catherine de Bourgh taking honours also. I was disappointed in Wickham though, he is supposed to be so charming - like all good con-men are, and yet I found him unattractive and rather sly looking. Jennifer Ehle seems to enjoy herself as Lizzie and while I felt that Colin Firth was a bit more Heathcliff than Mr Darcy at times - I found I didn't mind at all. <br />The music in this movie adaptation is also beautiful - and if you are interested there is a great book which has been published about the making of this movie - you can look up the locations, the music and find out all the background on it generally.<br />There have been some changes to Austen's words and scenes - most noticeably good old Darcy's infamous dive in the lake - but I didn't find at all off-putting. It has a good flow and the interference in the story is minimal. This version does run for some 6 hours (it was telly series) - so it isn't something you can necessarily expect to be able to sit in front of and watch non-stop. I guess it depends on your family though.
B000002JEV|5.0|Before I begin, let me first say that I have never really been a big fan of quote-unquote &quot;hard rock&quot; or &quot;metal&quot;.  To risk sounding like my grandfather, it all sounds like noise to me.  With that in mind, let me also say that the rock/metal bands I do enjoy are those with heavy blues influence, i.e. Jimi Hendrix, Rolling Stones, etc. Enter the BBC Sessions.  With a heady combination of heavy blues riffs, soaring guitar work, and Robert Plant's planitive, wailing voice, this CD has the crunch of a rock band and the soul of a Mississippi roadhouse.  As a Zepplin novice, I would recommend the BBC Sessions to anyone who may have been turned off by visions of just another &quot;hair&quot; band or one of those of those classic rock compilation CD commercials.<br />Of the two discs, CD1 is the most blues heavy.  It opens with a classic blues riff--wailing guitar over a deliciously deliberate bassline.  Track 2, &quot;I Can't Quit You&quot;  Opens with Robert Plant's distinctive pleading voice, and includes part of a Muddy Waters classic.  Robert Johnson is also directly represented on track 8, but the spirit of the great Delta blusemen is alive through the whole CD.<br />Disc 2 strays away from the blues a bit more, and includes some of the better known songs, such as &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; (even I had heard that one).  Although the opening track &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;  is hard-driving and throbs with energy, the blues begin creeping back in with &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, and by the time you get to &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot;, you have to wonder if these guys were in England or the Deep South.  &quot;...Loving You&quot;, track 3, is arguably the most soulful, sexy song on the CD, and stands out, even among classic rock standards such as &quot;Black Dog&quot; and &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, which stands as the zenith of disc 2.  Tracks 7 &amp; 8 are much more mellow, and the &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; medley plays like the band hadn't recovered from the earlier songs of the set.  Nevertheless, the CD as a whole is a testament to the strange but fruitful union of American blues and British rock in the 1960's, and is a worthwhile purchase for any music lover.
B00004XOWM|3.0|I was expecting much more, but over all it's not a horrible album, but it's not amazing either. &quot;Rollin&quot; is probably the best, most energized track on the record; it really gets you in the mood to mosh. &quot;My Way&quot; is also an excellent, yet slower song. I don't understand why people hate &quot;Getcha groove on&quot; I think it's cool. Anyway.. many of the songs are pretty boring...like hot dog. What a horrible horrible waste of space. If you're a bizkit fan i guess you should check it out, otherwise go for their first album.
0140074317|5.0|When I asked one of my German friends about their classical literature, she pointed me to &quot;Die unendliche Geschichte&quot; by Michael Ende.  First of all, I would recommend anyone fluent in German to read &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; in its original German version.  The story revolves around a young boy, Bastian, who feels himself an outcast of the real world.  He steals a book -- surprise, surprise -- called &quot;The Neverending Story.&quot;  What Bastian discovers is a land created through the power of imagination and fantasy.  To save Fantasia from destruction by the Nothing, Bastian must enter the world of his own fantasy.  The price of creation, however, is high.  For each wish grants Fantasia new life and takes from Bastian his memories of reality.  Bastian is reluctant to seek a way back home but must travel through Fantasia in search of the Child Empress.  Along the way, Bastian must learn to bridge the gap between reality and Fantasia or risk losing all of his memories forever.  Only by bridging this gap is Bastian able to make reality and Fantasia fit for human compassion, dreams, and hope.  Humanity is indeed defined by man's ability to perceive with idealism and practicality.
6303965415|5.0|Funnily enough Persuasion, Austen's final completed work, and the only one really linked to the Napoleonic Wars, was the only book she wrote in peacetime. Just a snippet of odd gossip which has nothing to do with this movie adaptation - which I loved.<br />Amanda Root was just perfect as Anne Elliot, the woman who had followed the good advice of her friend some seven years before and refused to marry a suitor without many prospects - Captain Wentworth. By sheer coincidence he returns to the neighbourhood with his sister and her husband. Partly to show Anne what a fool she has been in the past he starts seriously flirting with her two sisters-in-law (the sisters of her wife's brother) however it takes a near disaster to show that their feelings for one another haven't changed. Root plays Anne in beautifully - she is quiet, subdued, yet there is an elegance to her, and slowly her bloom returns. <br />I also really liked the production - the cinematography struck me as less colourful and bouyant than other recent Austen films (Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility) - in fact the skies often feel low, or crowded with clouds, the costumes dark and rooms not quite so brightly lit. Well until Anne gets to Bath that is where her father's extravagance seems to be shown in endlessly bright rooms. I really liked the production but I know that some people found them too authentic to be really enjoyable - things like hair being not quite clean or the small dark and rather claustrophobic rooms at Lyme. It is definitely a matter of taste.<br />A nicely unfolding film.
0790737345|3.0|Nicolas Cage deserves an Oscar for some of the funniest facial expressions you will EVER see.  City of Angels is a beautiful story about an Angel who'd rather live an isolated existence with a gorgeous doctor (Meg Ryan) than stand on Skyscrapers with a nerdy sidekick and consulate people's souls.  His self-indulging unholy fantasy is mine too.  He meets her at the hospital after  taking someone's soul to heaven.  Soon after the stalking begins.  He follows her wherever she goes and just stares at her with these intense looks of desperation and envy- as if he would do anything to be with her.  His expressions capture exactly how I feel when I meet a loving, intelligent, and sexy woman.  Meg even gets better with age.  However, his plan is worth nothing without her love in return.  One special moment occurs when she's begs him to show himself to talk to her.  She is very distraught and he just remains invisible, staring at her in this poignant condition.  Until, that is, she disrobes, when he magically appears.  It's beautiful.  He skips all the makeup junk and still gets her love.  Only an Angel could pull that one off.  Now in order to live with Meg, he must give up his wings.  His sidekick pleas for him to stay an Angel by showing him that he'd give up music every morning along the beach with other Angels.  But who wouldn't rather wake up every morning with Meg next to you?  I'd rather be human than Angel too, if I could have that.  If a guy as goofy looking as Nick gets a chance like this, he won't pass on it.  Finally the action in the cabin mimics my expressions too, if that could happen to me.  This is a funny impression of afterlife that can win most men sensitivity points if they watch it with a girlfriend or date.  However, you must hold back the laughter and talk very seriously about it.  And don't think because an Angel sees a woman as an object that you should too.  Rent this one it's not worth buying.
B0000024IE|4.0|I really dont know what to say. This album is just so tense, funky and it strikes both the heart and the mind. And not to forget the soul! Bursting with purpose and emotion. First time I heard it I broke down and cried like a baby, big me crying like a baby, I had just seen the movie Missisippi`s Burning and that movie together with this record just reminded me about what black people have gone thru. Make me feel ashamed of being white. Just put on &quot;Fight the Power&quot; and make Public Enemy`s mission your mission. Fight the power and blow the face of racism of off this earth once and for all. Everything is always up to yourself and dont you forget it, and dont you dare to look the other way.
B00001OH7P|1.0|This is one very overrated album. It was the trendy thing in late 1972, but now it sounds dated &amp; silly. Yes, I used to be a Bowie fan, saw the first three tours. But I don't care to relive this stuff. It's old &amp; unnecessary, boring &amp; bloated. Listen to Mott the Hoople's &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; instead. They did his song like he wished he had. And he still can't get over it.

B00000099Y|5.0|They proved this time around that they are not to be taken lightly, every song pleases the ears and gives me goosebumps.  Maynard is by far the best singer out of every other band that is currently active.  Highlights are Stinkfist, Eulogy, actually just listen to them all, every song is a masterpiece in itself.  You will not regret buying this CD, and whoever doesn't like Tool just doesn't understand their music.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I have always loved the X-MEN.Even i was a little disappointed when i saw my man GAMBIT was missing on the movie it was fabulous .I got to admit that i almost fell in love with STORM even she was nearly the weakest (on the contrary most beautiiful) mutant in the movie. I dont want to tell more things about the movie 'cos if like X-MEN and if you like action movies no way!! You somehow should see it.. What i am gonna say is you must see it on DVD.It is the best DVD i have ever purchased.If you like special features on DVDs just as i do get ready for the visual feast about everything of X-MEN...
6304083769|5.0|This is one of the finest examples of Japanese animation I have ever seen. From the complex and fascinating story-line to the beautiful art, Ghost in the Shell provides 90 minutes of pure excellence. This is the true cream of anime, it is an absolute must-see for any true anime fan.
B000050XEI|2.0|I have been an Enya fan now for 7 years, and his is quite possibly her least musically creative album to date.  Many of the songs on her album echo of songs on her other album Memory of Trees.  The wide varity of musical instrument just isn't there like in her past albums.  One song starts off pretty much the same as Tea House Moon, that track is # 7.  Track number #4 echos of Pax Decorum on the Memory of Trees also.  I respect her as an artist, but I would have much rather waited another year for a more postive outcome of this album.  This CD I payed $20, I felt like the album is worth only $10 because the feeling of repetiveness I got from listening to it.  Collectively the album lenght is only 34 minutes 20 seconds long.  It's rather short for $20.  Personally after listening to this album I would have taken it back to the store where I purchased it, but this is Enya and I feel like I can't do that.  As for variety of music on this album again, I think many of the harder rock/alternitive groups do better in this catagory, even though the lyrics are rather screamed and whispered than actually sung.  I do have to give her credit on Flora's Secret and Wild Child in which the lyrics are well writen.  The instramental aspect is repetive in peaks and lows.  I would rather anyday listen to her Memory of Trees or Shepherd Moons albums for the variety and quality.  Save yourself the money buying this album or ask someone to get it for you as a stocking stuffer for the Holidays.  The money out of my own wallet wasn't worth it. I look forward to her next album because no matter what it will be an improvement over this piece of art.
B000005RFQ|5.0|I bought the the cassette when it first came out, and really liked it then.  After 6 years of not listening to it at all, I was at friends house and he through it into the 100 disc CD changer.  Once I heard it, I begged him to play it over and over again.  I forgot how great it was.  I really think this is a masterpiece and should be listened to by all metal fans.  Ian Gillian's vocals are strong, heavy and loud.  Tony is in rare form on guitar, playing some of the darkest riffs ever played.  I just hope my three young children never listen to it...they may turn evil on me.
B000000993|4.0|..But still excellent.  Tool never cease to amaze me, with their strong and emotional songwriting abilities every song is a hit.  One of the only bands still worth listening to.
B00004Z459|1.0|Just another attempt by a band to embrace anger and pain, and yet again the result is irrelevent whining.  Angst has become something of a money-making machine these days. Those bands who do have lyrical content that implies they have read a book or two get buried.  From beginning to end this cd may actually cause one two bury there head into the ground and suffocate.  Presently I am looking into cryogenics to wait for a few bands to come out with something to say.  Eight years ago youth were yelling against injustice, and plight. Now they seem to be yelling because there car only has aluminum alloy wheels instead of Chrome.  Im not one to waist my time reviewing new bands that are so incredibly bad.  But Linkin Park just had fallen further into the hole caused by musical audacities.
6302860253|4.0|I enjoyed watchin this.... I was a bit miffed thought when I found that the beautiful recitateves had been replaced with rather weak diologue.  This video was billed as an opera and I felt a bit...well...cheated.  Julia Migenes' performance is amazing.  She mixes the sexy and serious side of Carmen beautifully, and I find her performance of &quot;L'amor est un oiseau rebelle&quot; to be the best recording available.  Placido Domingo's performance as Don Jose is also wonderful.  The best thing about this film is that it IS a film.  There is no cutain going up and down between acts and now bowing afterwards, allowing the audience to suspend there disbelief.  I usually enjoy live theater recorded versions to be more exciting but it is refreshing to see a classic put on the big screen...even with the various cuts and changes.  Good as the performances are, I kept thinking to myself, &quot;Where are Bizet's recitatives?&quot;  I strongly suggest this for someone who does not want to swan dive right into a full blown opera, or an opera buff looking for a change.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Lennon &amp; McCartney the best pop song writers period.  Harrison and Starr also the great personalities and additions to the Beatles.<br />Not more to say but &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, &quot;Penny Lane&quot;.......classics.<br />All classics, and a class act, if only &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; hit #1, this collection would be complete.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Jethro Tull's &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot; is an epic about life set to music.  Ian Anderson uses medieval history, comic book drama, and his own views on life in one long satire.  This is a &quot;poem&quot; that I can relate to since it reminds me of childhood fantasies and combines them with reality of today.  It is a vivid play in my mind every time I listen to it.  Much better than &quot;A Passion Play&quot; to me.
B00004XONN|5.0|KID A proved to me once and for all, that no matter how different Radiohead try to be they still wind up with that same old, awe-inspiring ability to make great music.  Come to think of it, I find it absolutely amazing that I've yet to hear an LP from Radiohead that I consider to be less than brilliant.<br />More specifically, KID A contains so many new styles, sounds, departures from the \\"norm\\" and instant classics that it feels more like a greatest hits compilation with entries taken over several years work.  In a way, I guess it is, considering they've recorded a lot more than 10 songs since 97's OK Computer.  Just try comparing Optimistic with Kid A, or Motion Picture Soundtrack with The National Anthem.<br />The only tip: give it time to sink in - it takes a while before you can truly appreciate what you're listening to - and once you're there, you'll listen to it another million times trying to explore every nuance of it.
006092988X|5.0|this book is a must read for anyone working with children. both heartwarming and heartbreaking, this compelling novel will encourage empathy in the most indifferent reader.
B000051VWW|4.0|I still play Sades &quot;Love Deluxe&quot; after 7 years it is still one of my most played CDs unlike most that get lost in the back bin in the closet somewhere, and then you find it 3 years later saying to yourself &quot;I bought this?&quot;.<br />&quot;Love Deluxe&quot; was a classic with &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot;, &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, etc.  &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; is a great effort but not to the standards of &quot;Love Deluxe&quot;....or maybe my sights were set to high when this album came out.  I really like it, but doesn't have the edge...The first single &quot;By Your Side&quot; is good, but not the punch I was hoping for.<br />I love Sade, I really do and all her albums are great, I just guess I am partial to &quot;Love Deluxe&quot;, and this album is growing on me day by day....I do have to say the album is wonderful throughout, not one bad song, but it just doesn't live up to my expectations of the 5 star &quot;Love Deluxe&quot;....maybe a year from now I will change my mind...However I still recommend it fully.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Very funny, talented, and smart is the words that come to mind when you think of blink. This cd is all of these things and more. No matter what music you like, there is no way can't like this cd.<br />Number three under the best punk albums of all time. Number 1 being Green Day's Dookie and Number 2 being the Offspring's smash cd.
B00004TDTO|2.0|First off, I really didn't care for how Universal decided to alter the sound effects of this classic movie, especially when there was no need for it. They could've just enhanced the original sounds for the DVD format, but no. Instead, there are completley new sounds replacing your old favorites throughout the entire movie.<br />The changes that really got to me in paticular were the ones during the movie's climactic showdown between Brody and the shark. The new sound effects of Brody blasting his gun at the toothy terror, hoping to hit the air tank, that he lodged down its throat, sounded ridiculously weak, like a child fireing a cap gun. And the sound of the shark exploding when Brody administered that one final shot either made you laugh or want to cry. It sounded like someone dropped a coffee mug and it shattered into two peices. Now how climactic is that!? <br />I also didn't care for the way this movie was presented visually. Though there was little grain and artifacts, this DVD was too dark! I already owned a copy of Jaws on VHS before I got a DVD player. So, I decided to run the same movie, on those two different formats at the same time, and on the same t.v., and the difference was staggering. You wouldn't believe how dramatic the difference was unless you saw it with your own eyes. The more I compared, switching my t.v.'s setting between t.v. and video, with just the click of a button, the more I wished I hadn't bought the dvd.  <br />All in all, this DVD proved to be a great dissapointment, and a movie this good deserves better treatment. It doesn't even have a commentary! All I can say is I hope Universal comes to their senses, and releases a definitive version of Jaws on dvd.  As it stands, Jaws 2 is a far better DVD than the original.  It wasn't a watered down laserdisc version. The deleted scenes were superior, the production photos were arranged better, showing all the shots of the shark first. I thought everything right down to the packaging of the Jaws 2 DVD was better than the first, and that shouldn't be.  <br />I'm not sure who was behind the making of the Jaws DVD, but I think they should re-release this title, and let the ones who did such a good job on the Jaws 2 DVD handle it.
0780018664|4.0|I had heard &quot;M&quot; spoken of for many years as a masterpiece of German Expressionism, as an early psychological thriller, as the first portrait of a serial killer. For these &amp; other reasons, I had been interested in seeing it for a long time. Now that I have, I feel it is an  important movie, but for reasons totally ignored by most film buffs: it is an amazing document of early Hitler Germany, made in the very first years of his taking power. As a time capsule of German values &amp; beliefs it couldn't be more revealing!<br />As &quot;M&quot; opens, we see some extremely dispirited looking children playing a singing game. In every scene of the movie that features a child, the children seem sedated, little zombies. Was this typical of German children of the period? Were they so benumbed by the economic disasters their parents endured that they had ceased to show any personality whatsoever? Or is this an example of the grinding propaganda they encountered in all aspects of their daily routine? <br />The &quot;Who is the Murderer?&quot; posters Fritz Lang depicts posted in the town feature the following text: &quot;It is every mother's highest duty to guard her child at all times.&quot; Whew!! Somehow I can't imagine an Wanted poster in the US of 1931 preaching quite so blatantly! The police are shown to be fat &amp; lazy, the criminal underworld organized into unions, &amp; at all turns, the ugly apparatus of a police-state are exhibited. For instance, in one scene, the police decide to raid a &quot;known underworld hang-out&quot;. The people drinking there are herded together, run thru the gauntlet individually &amp; anyone who doesn't have full paperwork on them is arrested. <br />Also on display in 3 scenes are examples of mob behavior, anonymous people gaining strength in numbers to gang up on an individual (whether guilty or innocent).<br />The most disturbing subtext runs thruout the entire film. A whole city is in an uproar over the murders of 8 children. Yet within a decade these same people would be accomplices in the murders of millions of children. <br />Yes, Fritz Lang's &quot;M&quot; is a classic, but not for any of the reasons usually given. If you have any knowledge of 20th Century German history, you will find it a fascinating time capsule &amp; a filmic explanation for the rise of the Nazi's. It is chilling &amp; very disturbing to watch.
B000002NBY|5.0|I was a freshman in college when this album came out.  I spent an entire semester with this cassette in &quot;heavy rotation&quot; in my dorm room.  To this day, I can put the CD in and be transported through time back to those days.  I honestly have never grown tired of it and the opening accordian strains are guaranteed to bring a smile to my face and a chill to my spine as I check out of the here and now to visit the there and then.<br />Moreover, the album transports the listener to a distant yet strangely familiar land.  Paul Simon masterfully blends South African rhythms with his own quirky New York outlook.  <br />Simon did so at considerable risk.  The mid 80's marked the time when the world was growning increasingly tired of the practice of Apartheid.  Musicians took up the cause and released one of the worst collaborative songs ever recorded, singing with all the false bravado they could muster &quot;I ain't gonna play Sun City&quot; thereby announcing a boycott of South Africa.  Imagine how saddened those poor South Afrikaaners must have been when they realized that they were going to be deprived of the hair and makeup bands of the 80s.  Tragic.   <br />Our hero, however was undaunted by the celebrity cause du jour and enlisted the support of a series of South African street musicians to record the songs that became this album.  Rather than being preachy and condemning the South African Government, Simon simply let the music speak for itself.  His own lyrics sit atop the fascinating music allowing all of us to see a truly unique perspective.  He did more in these forty five minutes to raise awareness than any collection of heavy-handed pop stars ever could have.  <br />In short, this album deserves to be listed among the 25 best of the rock era.  Period.  &quot;Exile on Main Street.&quot;  &quot;Blonde on Blonde.&quot;  &quot;Graceland.&quot;  &quot;Abbey Road.&quot;  It's a natural.  Buy this, put on the headphones, close your eyes and you'll be carriedaway.
0767802470|5.0|I (as a German) always wondered what I would have been like if I was born 50-60 years earlier. &quot;Das Boot&quot; showed me: Perhaps I would have been one of these young soldiers. When they enter their submarine, they just want to get to the battle, as they belive in Hitler and his promises. For them, the Allies are the &quot;bad guys&quot;. But as the battle starts, they begin to learn that there's no glory and honor, but just pain and suffering on both sides.<br />&quot;Das Boot&quot; does not try to find an excusion for the crimes that where caused by the Nazis during WWII - it only shows the true face of war. And it shows real, normal and &quot;small&quot; people being in the war and trying to survive.   But the movie is still entertaining - you won't see too much blood in it, you won't become sick because of a detailed view of exploding bodies. Because of this, you are able to keep on watching, and it's important to watch until the end. It is thrilling, yet realistic. You really feel like being inside. Not much to say about the weak points. The Special Effects are relatively poor sometimes, but that's not too important.<br />BTW: If You like the film because of its message, try to get the second-best German anti-war movie called &quot;Die Brücke&quot;. I saw it as a teenager and never even wanted to TOUCH a gun afterwards. <br />And please excuse my terrible English... ;-)
B00000G3Q4|5.0|If you own any of the Evil Dead movies on DVD, then you know that Raimi and Campbell are the absolute best at the DVD Commentary.<br />Like Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, Raimi and Campbell (along with Tapert) give you all the information, history, anecdotes, and stories behind just about every facet of the movie in the commentary.  In this DVD, Raimi and Tapert are on 1 commentary while Campbell is by himself on the other (with each pointing out how the other would probably tell a different story or hit on things a little bit better).  And typical of Raimi and Campbell, they seem to enjoy making fun of themselves and about how bad their movie was.<br />At any rate, Evil Dead is everything you would want if you are familiar with the series, and a pretty darn good horror flick nonetheless.<br />Get all the DVD's and enjoy the narratives that these great guys have given us.  No higher recommendation can be given on this or the other two movies for the DVD owner.<br />Also....The insert was also missing from my DVD, and an email to Elite Entertainment quickly and politely solved that problem.<br />Hail to the King Baby!
B00000DHR0|5.0|I also received this CD as a Xtmas gift last year and it's one of the most wonderful gifts I have ever received. Celine is increadible, she sings every song with such a feeling!

B00004XPPK|5.0|I don't care what initials follow your name, JD, MD, PhD.  This movie will hit you right in the solar plexus no matter how PC and \\"with it\\" you are.  It was made in the '40s, starring Rita Hayworth and Glen Ford, of all people, who normally I like in nothing!  I also usually despise movies where the hero and heroine hate one another until the last few minutes of the movie or book.  Well, just throw the rule books out with \\"Gilda.\\"  This film has chemistry with a capital \\"C\\".  Sex appeal and the fate of those couples \\"meant to be\\" exudes from every frame of it.  Rita Hayworth as Gilda is utterly gorgeous and desirable while Glen Ford as Johnny makes all other men pale in comparison.  She's married to his boss who owns a casino-nightclub in South America.  However, there will be no Gilda disappearing in the night skies with her husband as there was in \\"Casablanca.\\" These two lovers aren't that noble.  Instead, they verge on being outright scoundrels! Frankly, I never even thought Hayworth was much of a singer and dancer until I saw her perform \\"Put The Blame On Mame\\" in this film. Wow! I ate humble pie on that one.  I have this on video and I've lost count of how many times I've seen it, starting in my viewing as a pre-teenager.  Now I'm seriously thinking about getting it in DVD.  You can never have too much \\"Gilda.\\"  My advice: don't even fight it; trash out tonight in total pleasure with \\"Gilda.\\"  You might as well buy it as once will never be enough.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000002H5I|5.0|Listening to this music is as good as it gets. Chapman's lyrics are hard-hitting poetry that hits the heart. Her talent for shaping a song and leaving a lasting image is unparralled in today's cookie-cutter lyrics. It takes guts to stick out like Chapman does--and her fans love her for it. The only problem I have with Chapman is that she doesn't have a new CD out. Erin
B00004TJLD|4.0|Once I got it to work it was a great listening experience.<br />However please do note this DVD is designed for the new DVD AUDIO players.  If you have a DVD VIDEO player (which is what most of us have) you could need to make a change to your DVD Players setup.<br />If you play the disc and get NO SOUND, you need to change the PCM Linear audio setting in your DVD VIDEO players setup.  I had to change ours from 96mghz to 48 mghz to get the DVD to play on a DVD AUDIO player.
B00004VWAF|1.0|This issue of 'On the Corner' contains a mistake in the credits. Not a single percussionist is mentioned, although at least half of the music consists of percussion. The German issue of the Miles Davis autobiography (which includes an elaborate discography) lists three percussionists: Billy Hart (who is mentioned in the credits for drums, but not for percussion), Don Alias and M'tume. (P.S.: The single star is NOT for the music, but for the credits!)
0151003084|5.0|It's morbid and sick, but you have to love anything that rhyms the word ennui.<br />Everyone should own this book!
B000002LQR|5.0|Ok first of all this is the best cd ever made.  I think the best song on this cd is Breaking the Girl.  Its a great ballad that shows they have a soft side along with under the Bridge.  The best Chili song on this cd is probably suck my kiss.  What energy...wow that song is amazing.  Give it away is a great single.  Funky monks has great guitars.  I think that the best funny lyrics on the cd have to be Sir Psycho Sexy.  I have never heard such bad lyrics on a music cd.  Wow.  great ending with short but sweet there red hot.  flea definitely gets a bigger presence on this cd than the other ones.  And j. frusciante is awesome.  You can definitely tell that this band  is maturing.  U should be ashamed if u dont have this already. Peace
B00001NFCY|1.0|creed blows.it's that simple.this is the worst pile of garbage i've ever listened to!&quot;what if&quot; is pretty good, but if creed is a hard rock band, what the hell is &quot;arms wide open&quot;?this album could've been good if it was never recorded and if all the band members left to pursue other career interests, like sweeping up a mall, or taking orders via drive-thru.this is a terrible, brutal, attempt at making music.
014028009X|2.0|Bridget Jones's Diary fluxuates between being a critique of the superficiality of women's obsessions and a clever depiction of the growing pains of our late-twenties/early-thirties. Funny discussions with her flighty mother, overbearing friends, horrid boss, and stereotypical lovers do not make up for the disturbing simplification of intelligent women who seem introspective until they think about food, fat, self image, or clothing. <br />Disappointing as clever read, disappointing as expose of late-twentieth century women. Not worth buying, but worth reading a couple of chapters if you find it abandoned by someone tired with the repetition.
B000001E8P|5.0|Pulp is one of the most underappreciated bands around.  Different Class is a great example of how you can make intelligent music with catchy beats.  Jarvis Cocker has a sharp pen and no one is beneath his satirical insights.  He also has a silky smooth voice that masks the biting lyrics.  Great songs include &quot;Underwear&quot;, &quot;Live Bed Show&quot;, &quot;Common People&quot; &amp; &quot;Bar Italia&quot;. &quot;Disco 2000&quot; is the standout track with its poignant lyrics and shimmering sound it is a song that deserved to be a major hit in this country.  A true highlight and top-notch album from the 90's.
B00000163G|5.0|This is by far one of the best &quot;rap&quot; albums of all time. It is am ust have for any hip hoppers record collection....On par with owning zeppy 4. Tupac was at his lyrical peak during production of this album. I STILL listen to this cd even though I have owned it close to 4 yrs....It does not get boring. Highly recommend this cd.
B000002L82|4.0|Power, Corruption &amp; Lies is the best overall album New Order has released.  The album is basically dance music , but done in an artful and understated manner.  You get airy grooves as opposed to thumping beats with the sound flowing along effortlessly.  &quot;Blue Monday&quot; is the band's signature song and was the biggest selling 12 incher in UK history.  &quot;Your Silent Face&quot; is a great track as is &quot;Age Of Consent&quot;.  If you want intelligent and expertly crafted songs you can get up and move to, this is your album.
B00004Y2QT|5.0|Color me purple...a long time Prince admirer, even when he was mining for Gold, so perhaps I'm a judge.  Rave finally captures Prince in a concert setting, interactive, emotive, energetic, a consummate entertainer and a stunning guitarist, what the Sign-o-the-Times seemed unable to do with heavy laden vignettes.  I'm no audiophile but when he mimicks Lenny Kravitz's voice with his guitar on American Woman , it resonated in the middle of my head and I realized I was clenching my fists.  It's clear why Prince will only perform &quot;nothing compares 2 u&quot; with Rosie Gaines; she's spectacular.  Prince &quot;moshes&quot; during this concert, pretending he's swimming through the crowd leaving no viewer uninterested.  This is a concert where Prince showcases his greatest gift, the guitar solo, with enough close ups for you to taste.  He shares some of his yearning spirituality with &quot;The Christ&quot;, formerly known as &quot;The Cross&quot; from Sign-o-the-Times.  Terrifically balanced and followed by the most fun to hear and watch blues medley I've ever heard.
B00004UEDR|5.0|Sandra Bullock, with a few exceptions, has a tendency to star in movies that don't quite make it.  And this is one of them.<br />BUT, I was immediately and strangely moved by the story.  Maybe I was just in the right mood at the time.  I cannot remotely identify with the situation - alcohol and drug addict confined in rehab - and cannot vouch for the reality of what takes place.  But it seemed real, even that I might think and act like her in that situation.  Her feelings felt like feelings I have had.<br />To her character, Gwen, the counselors and her fellow addicts in in-patient rehab are weird.  I thought so, too.  She complains about &quot;romper room philosophy&quot; attempting to address very real, adult struggles.  I detested it as well.  She thinks her family doesn't understand.  They don't.  She resents being treated like a child by the employees.  I would, too.  But if this is an example, addicts need to be treated like adults with childish behaviors.  I wondered if such an artificial setting could help an addict overcome a problem that might very well still exist in the &quot;real world.&quot;<br />By the end of the movie, Gwen is on a path that can lead to sobriety, almost, it seems, in spite of these weird people and inane platitudes.  I'm not even sure what the turning point for her was, and perhaps there was no single turning point.  It isn't usually that easy.  She has learned to care about the people and care for their struggles, and thus care for her own.  She begins to see beyond the simplistic chants into truths about her lovability, capability, and strength.  She has turned her back on her destructive past and embraced a sober future that seems possible and desirable.<br />No excuses for addiction are proffered in this film, even though the presumed origin of the character's addiction is presented.  It is demonstrated that a person in the same situation did not resort to drugs and alcohol to drift through life.  The movie's premise is very simple: one person's handling of her self-destruction and renewal.<br />Kudos and thanks for a great movie.
B00000IAU3|5.0|After hearing Stan from the eminem cd i went and got this one. It was outstanding with many stand out tracks. She has a great voice and the tracks flow nicely. My only complaint was the lack of material. For instance Thank you starts off with a 30 second intro then she sings the chrous to Stan. Followed by that she sings a altered version of the Stan chorus and then she goes into the thank you part. The second part is another short variation of Stan and the thank you part again. I think the second part should've had two Stan variations instead of 1 and there should of been a third part.
B0000067X1|5.0|Just when Yes and ELP were starting to make art rock REALLY tacky, along came Can to deliver a shock to the system.<br />Most art-rock up until Tago Mago was based on Europian classical music. The name of the game?: How much uneeded orinmentation can you pack onto a piece of vinyl? After all, a guitar solo based on six Bach differant inventions needs to be 16 minutes long, doesn't it?<br />Can stuck a machete into this bloated balloon. Tago Mago has its roots in African-American funk and Stockhausan's minimalist experiments: Songs like &quot;Mushroom&quot; and &quot;Aumgn&quot; find a basic  groove, strip it to its bare essentials, and repeat it until it is drained of all possibilities. Hypnotic, driving, bold and artful.  Centuries ahead of anything Beetoven (or the Moody Blues) ever dreamed of.<br />This appraoch liberated art rock. The main line &quot;progressive&quot; bands embalmed themselves on FM radio, so highly ashamed of  rock and roll that they tried to dress it in 19th century classical drag. Can, meanwhile, explored all the possibillites of modern Europian movments that these Mozart Flesh Eaters didn't even begin to understand. Simultanioualy, they embraced Stax and James Brown, just as Miles Davis did during this period. In the procress, any percived wall between rock and art was blown apart.<br />Tago Mago also bore many musical offspring. Bands from Stereolab to the Talking Heads learned about the power of repetition and grove from Can.<br />Tricky. Cul-du-Sac. Bark Psychosis. The Stone Roeses. A dancing, grooving cast of 1000s. It all goes back to Can's art.<br />Art that rocks.
B000002KBU|5.0|This is one of the must-have albums of all time. I have known it since it was released and have come back to it time and time again. It holds up. The only tragedy is that Mitchell never did anything better. When Robert Downey's character on Ally McBeal played &quot;The River&quot; it was the perfect note. How better to say you're a sensitive guy than to play an obscure, 30 year old &quot;Christmas song&quot; by Joni Mitchell? Of course I have the vinyl, but now I gotta have the disc. Gotta love 1-click.
B00000DD1S|4.0|This might be a place for fearers of free-jazz to get started- each track starts out nicely structured, with beautiful, haunting melodies and marches repeated throughout the track.  I found the melody-lines sticking around with me as I went about my day.  But with virtually every track there's a point when one of the Ayler brothers loses patience with structure, exploding either into Albert's ineffable squealing or Don's skittery, initally overpowering trumpet attack.  I appreciated Ayler's approach, displaying a summation of joy in the structure of the songs, and then displaying it in another form with the soloists' abstract approach.  The solos are, as the liner notes say, however &quot;virtually indistinguishable&quot; from track to track, and I think, at least as far as saxophonal squealing and shrieking go (and how far does it go- there's a question), other contemporaries of Ayler had a more nuanced sound, though the purity and novelty of Ayler's saxophone, as I believe he basically &quot;invented&quot; abstract squealing, deserve credit.  As I repeatedly listen to the two CD's in this collection, I better appreciate each of the soloists approaches, and, as I alluded to previously, there are several tracks, most notably Ayler's tribute to Coltrane, that are purely melodical, despite the near cacophony of his rhythm section. These CD's are definetely worth checking out, and a nice introduction to Ayler.
0375501851|5.0|It is impressive enough, let's be honest, that a 24-year-old can have the maturity and diligence to complete a novel of any sort. But to complete one that is deep on so many levels, so funny, so pertinent to how we live today, balances so many different plotlines without ever losing control of any of them, speaks in so many different voices (from a conflicted Bengali Muslim to a hardcore animal rights activist to a 85-year-old Jehovah's Witness, and many others in between) without ever sounding less than authentic, is so rare that one almost considers it a miracle. <br />Forget all those, &quot;all white people are bad, everyone else is good&quot; multiculturalism books they made you read in college that were universally lame. This is by far the most pertinent book about mutliculturalism that I've ever read, because it is based on real life as it is currently lived, not on guilt for the sins of our ancestors. It is about the difficulty in staying true to ones roots, but at the same time being a part of the present and future. This novel goes so much deeper than that though, because ultimately, it is not just about culture as a whole, but about the individual. About the desperate need of the individual to feel that his or her existence is important. I hope I'm not making this book sound too serious. Zadie Smith has an incredibly hilarious writing style, that keeps you laughing and smiling even as the more important messages of the novel seep into your mind. This novel isn't perfect (what is?), some characters that we come to care about early in the book fade into secondary characters a bit too quickly (Clara, for example) and some of the novels morals are not quite as subtle as the author probably intends. Still, this novel is so good I can't bring myself to give is anything less than five stars. Not to get too strung up in hyperbole, but reading a novel like this, by such a young writer who one hopes will only get better with time, makes one feel more comfortable about the future of literature.
0393317552|3.0|More on GG&amp;S : I have just read the 99 most recent customers reviews on this book - Nobody has remarked that for J.Diamond the allotment of territories between peoples works like the attribution of seats in a movie theatre : who comes first gets the good seats, who comes later gets the bad ones and ( at least in our indecently civilized countries)everybody accepts the rule. Carthaginians had the better seat and Byzantines too.
6304779607|5.0|It's no wonder people who care for rights of criminals more than the rights of victims hate this movie. Imagine that - here's a cop who not only says openly what he thinks of criminals and &quot;civilized judges&quot; but even puts his words into action. The &quot;human rights&quot; (criminal rights, that is) people called this movie &quot;fascist&quot; (it's their favorite epiteth for anything that's not compatible with their way of &quot;thinking&quot;). Don't listen to that babble - the same people hate &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and don't bash it only because it's a classic that they, being cowards, don't dare attack. &quot;Cobra&quot; isn't a classic yet (hopefully it will be), so it's a great object for an attack.<br />I'm not sure about USA these days, but boy, my country could sure use a few Cobras! Buy the movie, buy &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and don't forget Heinlein's &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (not the dreadful film by Verhoeven) for a grim - though, admittedly, in &quot;Cobra's&quot; case, often too simplistic and too direct - comment on today's world... One more thing - &quot;Cobra&quot; has a superb soundtrack! A true fantastic voyage to the 1980s... I normally prefer orchestral scores, but Cobra's soundtrack, consisting mostly of songs (and the excellent orchestral opening theme) is one of  few so great compilations of such music. Don't forget to get the soundtrack in addition to the DVD!
B00004Y7SF|5.0|I have never liked Christmas music from any artist.  Something about the overall mood never appealed to me.  This is the first Christmas CD that I actually love to listen to all night.  She gives Christmas a more modern beat, that finally gets us away from the senior boom 50's feel.  Its about time.
6303168507|5.0|Stephen Spielberg's extraordinary epic retelling of German war profiteer Oskar Schindler, a superb Liam Neeson, risking all that he has to save over 1,000 Jews amidst the awful genocide of World War II. This is quite simply the most vivid, powerful, and unforgetable cinematic experience I had in 1993. Spielberg's labour of love is truely destined to be a classic, desevedly so, because by refusing to spare us the horrific pain and death of the Holocaust, Spielberg has made a film that will forever remind all who view it of the wonder and importance of Life.
B00003CXE7|4.0|I was very impressed with the production values of both the original film and the DVD. The movie is rendered with excellent skill on virtually all levels: camera work, lighting, musical score, sets... everything. It stands as a stunning tour-de-force of the cinematic arts. <br />The actual screenplay and the rendering of it are a little less impressive. While it certainly makes for enthralling viewing, there are several instances where the story drags, becomes unnecessarily complex, or leaves leaves plot complications dangling unresolved. For these minor sins I rate the movie four stars instead of five.
0679879269|5.0|This was a truly breathtaking work; I read it unable to stop turning the pages yet unwilling to finish.  The Amber Spyglass is intellectually challenging, theologically shocking, extraordinarily beautiful in its prose and tells a great story besides.  Don't read it without reading the other books in the trilogy first; this is a story in three books and Pullman is very light on the exposition by this installment.  I won't give much away; most of the characters we met in earlier instalments reappear, including some you might not expect, and an awful lot of people die, but if you've read the first two books you will be used to that.  In fact, my one complaint about this trilogy is that pretty much as soon as someone is described as brave or valiant, you know they're going to be killed within a chapter or two (I exaggerate: of course there are many exceptions to this rule).  I wouldn't have guessed that 12-year-olds would like this book; certainly it is entirely satisfying to an adult reader.  The book is an exquisitely crafted, brilliantly conceived novel that I expect to enjoy for the rest of my life.
B000002C4J|1.0|This is what's wrong with people.
B000002BHE|5.0|Celine Dion is my all-time favorite singer. She has a fantastic, powerful voice and has recorded many beautiful love songs. This is , in my opinion, her best album. It has the best songs and her voice is at its peak on this album. If your a fan of adult contemporary music, this album is a must. It has a good mixture of ballads and up tempo numbers. My two favorite songs on the album are &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; the touching theme for the 1996 movie Up Close &amp; Personal, and Celine's powerhouse cover of Eric Carmen's 1975 hit &quot;All By Myself.&quot; Other highlights include the 7 minute opus &quot;Its All Coming Back To Me Now,&quot; beautiful ballad &quot;Seduces Me&quot; the sensual title track, the reggae-splashed &quot;Make You Happy,&quot; and the memorable &quot;Fly,&quot; which Celine dedictated to her niece who tragically died of cystic fibrosis.
B000056HE9|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites.  It's full of humor, drama, and (heavy sigh) love.  It's just the right ticket to make you feel warm and fuzzy all over.  And let's face it, Cary Grant is NEVER hard on the eyes!!
B00000DHR0|5.0|This is my second favorite album of Celine (my favorite is Falling Into You). It perfectly balances traditional Christmas hymns and carols with new songs. Celine showcases her spectacular voice on her operatic renditions of classics such as &quot;O Holy Night,&quot; &quot;Ave Maria,&quot; and &quot;O Come All Ye Faithful.&quot; The new songs are also exceptional including: &quot;Don't Save It All For Christmas Day&quot; (which Celine co-wrote), Bryan Adams' tender ballad &quot;Another Year Has Gone By,&quot; &quot;The Prayer,&quot; an incredible duet with Andrea Bocelli, and the no. 1 single &quot;I'm Your Angel,&quot; a duet with R. Kelly. Celine proves her incredible talent by singing in five different languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Latin) on this album.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Growing up I knew there were two types of Animation, one was the bland american servings of Disney and Warner Brothers... and the other side of the coin which was Japanese Anime.<br />Anime was not huckleberry hound or mickey mouse or something lame like that.  Anime was action filled and it had a storyline that keeps you glued to the screen.  This was animation for the thinking person, anime brings to life what may sometimes be difficult to play live action.  Also, this reads like a powerful comic book.<br />Back to Princess Mononoke, I am thoroughly impressed by this production.  The Mythicism and Magic that this film invokes is priceless.  I was at awe watching these beasts...  I was enthralled as to what will happen next.  And the whole rollercoaster ride is what it really is...  a powerpacked punch that is riddled with Imagination.<br />All I am saying is that this film is great.  YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO SEE IT!
0440234743|3.0|John went ti the spiritual side of his feelings this time.  We need more of that from our famous writers.  Good Job!
0380729407|5.0|Ray Bradbury is an intriguing and insightful author.  In this novel, which revolves around the life of two young boys that are attached at the hip, the fantastical plotline is only a small portion of what the book has to offer.  The novel opens and the reader is introduced to the two young boys, each with very different backgrounds.  One resents his lack of a father, and the other resents the advanced age of his father.  One wants to forever cling to his boyhood, and the other can't wait to turn around and spit on his youth.  When a dark and strange carnival comes to town, it seems that it holds solutions for everyone within its billowing tents.  The one boy can grow older, and the other boy can make his father younger.  Through the progression of the novel, many characters are lost to the somber carnival, and many of its previous members are introduced.  If the reader can only cling on through the intense twists and turns this novel takes, he will be rewarded greatly at the end.  Insight into human nature, and the true colors of good, found in the age-bent body of the father, and evil, found in many of the carnival members (essentially the owner, Mr. Black), will all be received by the faithful reader.  The two boys triumph over the evil strangers, and they escape with scars gained only from their loss of innocence.  In essence, it's the not quite average story of two boys reaching the brink of manhood.
0898453992|4.0|The short story, &quot;Breakfast At Tiffany's&quot; by Truman Capote, is certainlty a compelling publication. It is enthralling, and gives one a true aspect of life in everyday society. Capote's novel teaches one about life, and the myths it holds. He sets the stage up for Holly Golightly to &quot;fail&quot; over and over again, which is what life really is about - bouncing back to realitization.<br />  Throughout the novel, the main charecter Holly Golighty goes on a whirlwind of adventures. She is always conforming to society, going in and out of crowds as she pleases, until she finds a part of her hidden self. Capote creates real human feelings and emotions in this book that many people are able to relate with, which makes it so compelling. This novel certainly is one to treasure, along with the other writings that go with it. The book displays the realities of life, and the harshness that exists in the world.<br />  Nothing is perfect, no matter how hard one tries. This is what Truman Capote is trying to point out to the reader. The novel's honest truth is why it is so loved, and the connection that many people have in common with Holly is very apprieciative too. Without this writing, the world would be missing something that can touch the lives of so many. *
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is one of the best cds i have ever heard! I only became a fan of the Chili Peppers after borrowing this off a friend, which made me also buy Blood Sugar Sex Magik,(also fantastic!).None of the songs sound the same, and there are a lot of different styles here.My favourite song on this album has to be Otherside. It is totally amazing and unlike anything i have ever heard before. Other stand-out tracks for me are Scar Tissue, Parallel Universe and Porcelain, which is a really beautiful lullaby-style song.Even though there are a few fillers on Californication, there isn't a bad song on this album. I would recommend this cd to anyone, whether they were a fan of RHCP or not. It is definately one of my favourite albums ever!
B00003CXE7|5.0|DVD's like this are loaded for our entertainment and enjoyment.  Some background information is good but when there is an abundance like this set, stand back and enjoy the ride. This 2 DVD set is absolutely a marvel to watch.  Here special effects are used to show us the Rome we have only seen in lavicious paintings. Now we can be absorbed into the plot and character roles without distraction from poor effects.  The story line and actors chosen for this epic were excellent choices.  I just want to say watch this movie (Disk 1 uninterrupted for almost 3 hours) then watch the 2nd Disk; the deleted scenes (adds to the story line/plot immensely), the making of, and the real Gladitor Story (an amazing tale).  With all this information return to review the movie once again for an entirely new perspective.  If you liked Spartacus (1960) you'll love &quot;The Gladitor&quot; (2000).  You'll be watching this movie again.  A great addition to the DVD library.
B00004SU5J|4.0|...then it kinda gets too housey.  it's all good.  it's variety.  it's just a little eclectic.  overall likeable
B00000J7JO|5.0|I'm 13 and i don't usualy listen to rock sung by 40 year old guitarists but i really like this one i bought a few weaks after the californication single came out and i love it. The lyrics are kind of hard to understand but once you do understand them they don't make much sense. There is also a bit of variety on the cd which makes it easier for older people to listen to.Go and do yourself a favour and get this cd for someone you know or just for yourself you or that person won't be disapointed
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I've known these guys since they first got together and they still surprise me.  All of their music is worth checking out. From splits, to vinyl, to their cd's.  I can tell you, having known them that its all real, its all from the heart, and it couldn't come from a better group of guys.  Listen to it. Live it. You will not be dissapointed. Better yet see them live.  After all they've only been touring straight for the last 7 years. One really has no excuse for having not seen them.  Enjoy.
B00000K3UR|1.0|I saw this movie thinking it would be as funny as adam sandlers other movies,plain and simple this was a flop. There was 1-2 parts that were funny but thats about it. Some people thought it was cute what did they think was cute the 5 year old boy [peeing] on the side of the restaurant. i did not think it was funny. i saw it at the theatre and half way thru the movie there was more and more empty seats...
B00002DEIX|4.0|What I liked about this album, perhaps the most enjoyable from this artist, was the complete ease his playing conveys throughout. Whether lyrical as on &quot;Courage&quot;  or upbeat as on &quot;Stoic&quot; or sensuous and melodic almost Ben Websterish on &quot;Twilight ...and beyond&quot; Mr Redman is completely at ease, with nothing to prove. If Mr Charles Parker was right when he said &quot;If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn&quot; then Mr Redman is one contended human with Peace in his heart. I loved the tongueing - slapping a la early Hawk on &quot;Last Rites of Rock and Roll&quot; which was a real hoot. Overall, a very well conceived and well played album worthy of many many listenings.
B000000OA6|3.0|Some say it is one of the best Queen albums, I say it has one of the best Queen songs. Innuendo and The Show must go on are really catchy and all-time classics, and this CD has other excellent moments, but not remarkable ones also, unfortunately. I'm going slightly mad, Delilah and Bijou are one of the band's worst songs ever I think. It's not Queen, it's something new, but not in the way like they did it with Hot Space, that opened new lines with better quality.<br />It's a good work in complex, but not The Miracle of theirs, I think.

B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is a great film.  It is the best and most original film of the 90's, and 1 of the 10 best movies of all time. It reminds us of the personal things that we find beautiful.  And it tells us to push beyond the surface of things so we might find that which we did not see before.   Its a film filled with powerful performances and heartbreaking tradgety.  Some people may not understand this type of movie.  But those people are blind anyway, and probably are obsessed with action movies.  And lets face it those are the worst people. AND WHATS WITH THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS DVD. DONT YOU BUY A DVD FOR THE MOVIE, NOT THE EXTRAS.  Thanks for that.  AMERICAN BEAUTY is master storytelling and well possibly the most brilliant film of all time.
0140177396|5.0|Of mice and men was an astounding novel that was worth reading. Of mice and men was a very touching novel with two main characters named George and Lennie. George would probably be considered the brains of the outfit and who is the shield that protects Lennie from trouble. Lennie on the other hand is the bronze, he is extra strong but has a deformity in the mind. Both have a goal in mind, which is to save enough money in order to purchase their own farm. This is where they both try to find decent jobs where it requires brains and bronze so that George can keep an eye on Lennie.  They get many jobs but the majority of them do not go as well as they hoped for. But towards the end they find a pretty nice job with a very nice lady who is wed to a hot-tempered guy named Curley. Well Curley's wife does do a lot of metaphoric phrases in the novel, such as comparing the the whole country to mutts just basically states the direction in which curley's wife addresses the inhabitants of the entire country. The job that was with Burley and his wife should have paid for the farm if Lennie had not done what he had done. For this Lennie gets into trouble when George is not looking after him and Lennie does something extremely disastrous. What happens in the end though is a very touching scene but I will leave that for you to read.
6303921248|5.0|This movie is awesome if you want a sitdown (for 5 hours), romantic, story.  It makes you cry; it makes you laugh.  It has the best plot of a classic love story.  The man chases the woman he loves until he &quot;captures&quot; her.  The casting is excellent.  No big names were needed to make this picture spectacular.  You will fall in love with Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.  Excellent Movie= well worth the time and money!
B00004Z511|5.0|I recently purchased Kid A, being a casual Radiohead fan. I owned Pablo Honey and OK Computer, and was interested to see what they were able to come up with next. From the moment I slipped my headphones on I was stunned. Radiohead is experimenting with sound textures in such a way as to create a CD unlike anything you've ever heard before---a total departure from their previous efforts. Now everything I hear on the radio sounds horribly dated and shallow. What did Thom Yorke say in &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot;? &quot;Alternative rock music is a stale format, like a fridge buzzing.&quot;? That's what the current crop of music sounds like to me now - a fridge buzz. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD now.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is probably one of, if not the best CD I have. The music itself is just awesome and the lyrics are just as good. Add in a great DJ and you have this CD. The only problem is that this is going to be there best CD likely becuase I know what's going to happen to them. they're probably going to go Rap-Metal like all the other good rock bands do, and I'm not sayin I dont like those bands but it just gets old and all the good rock bands are turning rap. I hope that doesnt happen with these guys.
B00003CXE7|2.0|Somewhere in Ridley Scott's grandly engineered epic, hammered on and tinkered with by a horde of writers and rewriters, is a flesh-and-blood story that gets lost in all the bread and circuses. <br />Crowe plays Maximus, the most-trusted general serving the aging Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), leading troops into battle against Germania in 180 A.D. But Marcus Aurelius wants Maximus to fight a tougher opponent -- the corruption of Rome -- by taking power after the emperor's death and restoring the republic. Maximus is reluctant, preferring to return to his wife and son, but he agrees to serve his Caesar. But his Caesar doesn't last too long, thanks to Marcus Aurelius' snotty son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who kills Daddy and takes the throne - and orders Maximus and his family executed. Maximus escapes, only to be captured by slave traders who train him as a gladiator. Maximus gets a chance at revenge on Commodus when his owner/promoter, Don King, er, Proximo (Oliver Reed), gets Maximus the big gig at the original Caesar's Palace - the Colosseum. Maximus is a hit with the crowd, setting him against Commodus in a battle for the hearts and minds of Rome. <br />Gladiator is pretty to watch but doesn't have enough plot to be a Roman epic (and what plot it has is pinched from Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus), and too much plot to be an action movie (even with the 2-1/2 hour running time). A few things get muddled in the course of things, like the relationship between Commodus' sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and Maximus (or, Lucilla's relationship with Commodus), and some intrigue with the Senate (led by Derek Jacobi, who knows his way around a toga after starring in &quot;I, Claudius&quot;). Also, there is the distraction of Phoenix, who plays Roman villainy like a very weak John Malkovich. <br />As far as the DVD itself goes - It's awesome - Better than the movie itself. Presented in an anamorphic 2.35:1 transfer, the visual presentation found on the Gladiator: Signature Collection is an almost flawless recreation of the film as I saw it theatrically. The jerky visuals of the war sequences come across as faithfully as the polished exteriors in Rome. The varying degrees of color saturation are rendered amazingly well, from the drab, washed out exteriors in Germania to the earthy tones of Zucchabar, and the vibrant cityscape of Rome. The print is almost completely free from any debris or other imperfections, and appears to have suffered only very slight edge enhancement in a few scenes, making for a wonderfully clean, sometimes polished, but always film-like image. The DVD includes a full-length audio commentary by Director Ridley Scott, Editor Peitro Scalia, and Director of Photography John Matieson. This is a great commentary track that appeals to the more technically oriented film fan. The topics range from Scott's views on historical accuracy, to motivating the actors, to the challenges of making a film of this nature, and more. <br />There is also a section aptly titled From the Cutting Room Floor. Included here are 11 deleted scenes, playable with or without commentary by Director Ridley Scott, that range from 30 seconds to 4 minutes. The 2.35:1 non-anamorphic scenes look quite nice, but have obviously not been through the same postproduction processing as the main feature. In addition to the deleted scenes, there is a 7-minute montage of deleted snippets of footage that is accompanied by the music of Hans Zimmer...this is, for all intents and purposes, a music video. The Making of Gladiator is a 25-minute feature that is pretty much the typical &quot;cable television promotional making of&quot; that we've all come to know and love. The use of Zimmer's music throughout this featurette lends a certain charm to the piece that some similar programs lack...and if nothing else, the antics and charisma of Russell Crowe make this one worth watching even if such material isn't normally to your liking. A nice, and somewhat surprising inclusion is the 50-minute TLC program Gladiator Games: Roman Blood Sport - Very informative. Along with other very cool extras, this DVD is simply a must purchase.
B000003JDA|5.0|To all those Tull fans that scream for \\"Aqualung!\\" thru the entire concert - knowing full well it comes at the encore - don't buy this.  You couldn't appreciate the other 98% of Tull's beautiful and intelligent music, especially this fine piece of musical mastery.  The most progressive Tull ever - these eclectic arrangements will positively affect your soul. The title track, Dangerous Veils and Out of the Noise more than rock, they grab you and vigorously shake you!  Out of the Noise features excellent fills from Barre's which epitomizes the way an ensemble contributes... to make the \\"whole > the sum of its parts.\\" Album energy peaks at track 8 and lets the listener down gently with the final 3 tracks that reflect upon moods and mortality.  Track 7, Beside Myself, about a child prostitute in Bombay - and the singer's feelings of reflected guilt and hopelessness - is the most emotionally moving Tull song I've heard. And I have heard them all.  Just a note ... Johnathan Noyce does not play on this album. The majority of the bass work was done by brilliant sessionist Steve Bailey. Not to compare him with the personalities and playing styles of other Tull bassists - but he is almost in a league with Stanley Clarke or Les Claypool.  Just listen.  Buckle up before you crank it up!
0399146253|2.0|Patricia Cornwell's early books are loaded with gripping plots and unforgettable characters.  Not so in her last 2 books with Last Precinct even less satisfying than Black Notice.  Dr. Kay Scarpetta has become a whiny character with no dimension other than her job.  I figured out the plot of this book at the end of Black Notice. She should have combined the two books into one.   Borrow it don't buy it.
B000002U9W|5.0|Atom Heart Mother is very different from most of Pink Floyd's albums from the 70s. It's not mainstream at all, and makes no effort to be commercial. However, it's still very good. The title track is the longest instrumental I know, clocking in at about 23 minutes. It's very strange, but has a good melody and some nice french horn bits. The next track, &quot;If,&quot; is one of those rare Roger Waters written songs that isn't upbeat, isn't bombastic, and isn't whining. It has a very simple guitar part, but is still good. The next track, &quot;Summer '68&quot; is my favorite song on this album. It's one of the few tracks written by Wright. It has a very good piano part, is upbeat, catchy, and is very complex. It's a pity that Wright didn't write more songs... Fat Old Sun is the next track, and is very good. If you like it, do yourself a favor and find a bootleg of one of the BBC broadcasts with the extended version. The last track, &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot; is about half sound effects and very quiet talking and half music. Even though it is strange and sounds very improvised, I still like it. To sum up, Atom Heart Mother is a good addition to your music collection.
0515125024|4.0|This is the first Lee Child book I've read, and it grabbed my attention from the very start. It has an evolving plot that keeps you wondering what the next page will bring. The involvement of the FBI and the Miltary shouldn't be looked at too critically or unrealistically as some readers may tend to do.  This story, having as it's plot,a militia, lead by a charismatic,dangerous wacko who wants to form his own separate world in the wilds of Montana.   When he instigates the kidnapping of an FBI agent,he unknowingly involves an innocent bystander who turns out to be Jack Reacher, a very skilled and highly decorated former member of the Military. This spells trouble for the militia's plans involving the agent and their sinister plans for their celebration of Independence Day. I look forward to catching up with past Reacher books,as I really enjoyed this one.
B000002LK1|5.0|Im a hardcore DM fan, i liked every album they made until Violator, i stayed amazed with this...!!!yes, DM gots his high with Violator, its the peak of the band. Since &quot;Music For The Masses&quot;, theres no other like this, its a great combination between upbeat (not so)and mood songs. The last album where DM uses synth at all, after this they introduce sounds and lyrics kind of strange for them. Youll never be dissapointed with it.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|Yeah, I know it's rated R. But there's an R for violence, an R for sex.  This earned an R for Raunch.  &quot;All the kids are talking about it at the lunch table,&quot; is what I heard from my 6th grader.  He wanted to know what they were talking about, so I let him rent it himself.  I'm embarrassed to say, he didn't need me to explain anything.  It was so graphic anyway, there was no explaining necessary.  As an adult, I'd say this movie is worth a late night peek when it comes on cable.  It's not suitable for Jr. High or younger.  Then if you really like what you see, then the extra material on the DVD might be for you.  If you can stomach it.
B00003CXFG|4.0|&quot;Pitch Black&quot; is another &quot;Alien&quot; variation. You have your usual team of estranded space travellers, the deserted base and the mystery about the disappearance of all humans and animals. Then you have your monsters, with big heads and killer jaws.<br />But this is an excellent variation. The monsters are affected if touched by light. Now the planet is in total darkness due to a long eclipse. The way to survive is to keep batteries running and the fire out of the rain.<br />Another good element of suspense if the addition of a killer within the group of survivors.<br />The movie is even better than it sounds. The special effects are superb and the movie is very well crafted. No masterpiece, ok, but an excellent addition to your horror/sci-fi collection.
B000002J6F|5.0|Only the White Album rivals (and trumps) &quot;Manassas&quot; in the category of masterpieces diminished by the turn-of-the-decade virus where artists felt compelled to produce double albums (and I could erase half of &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; without great harm). Take away (from the album format) sides 1 and 4, and leave me only sides 2 and 3, and you have the best--the best--example of that California country-rock business that the Byrds, Burritos, Eagles, and whoever else attempted.  And while we're here, let me put in a plug for the other great lost forgotten double album of the early 70's:  Dobie Gray, if you let me combine &quot;Drift Away&quot;: and &quot;Loving Arms&quot; into a single release. Bonnie Raitt finally got her due.  Why not Dobie Gray, who brought together soul and country, with the backing of some Muscle Shoals emigres to Nashville, and the sublime pop songs of Mentor Williams?
6303014100|5.0|When Hollywood attempts to re-enact history, they usually fall into one of several traps.  They might try to superimpose a fictional romance over the whole thing... or tell the story through the eyes of an overblown super-hero... and if that item of history happens to be a war, they usually use enough fake blood to sail a ship on.  Usually they just wind up forgetting the historical part, and produce a film with enough violence to appeal to men with short attention spans, and enough romance to appeal to women with short attention spans.  <br />Thankfully, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; fell into NONE of these traps.  What was created is extremely accurate, with only enough &quot;add-ins&quot; to tell the story of how history's players were likely to have fealt almost 140 years ago.  This IS history!<br />Tastefully done, the film portrays the emotional and physical struggles of the men who fought the Battle of Gettysburg, and pays great tribute to the 53,000 who lost their lives there.  There is no extreme gore here... as I said, it IS tastfully done.<br />It is also a film for an intelligent audience.  You MUST pay attention (which is something I had no trouble with).  This movie has NOT been dumbed down for an audience with a short attention span, as so many others have.  You WILL learn some history here, folks.  <br />I must congradulate whoever was in charge of casting... the actors actually LOOK like the characters they portray!  To illustrate this, they actually compare the actors' photos to old &quot;tin-type&quot; photos of the historical persons they are performing as.  Excellent acting and dialog are present throughout... and none of the actors, no matter HOW famous, dominates the movie.  (It would have been all too easy to allow one big 'star' to turn the entire thing into a glorification of himself!)  Definately classic acting in the 'old school' style.<br />At over 4 hours long, and considering its accurate content, it is sure to become a classic with Civil Warhistorians, re-enactors, and the general public alike...
0399146253|3.0|I found the book to be a good read, tough to put down.  In the end, though, I had a problem with the completely unbelievable premise that Dr. Scarpetta would be the target of a murder investigation, that the prosecuter of this investigation would involve Kay so much in it, and that it would be allowed to continue as long as it did.<br />Too many loose ends, too.<br />However, I enjoyed the new insights into the character and look forward to discovering what the future brings for her.
B000002MG1|5.0|5 years ago I did not own an REM album. I always knew the songs, but didn't have the albums.(Hey, I was young and poor). I bought this album 5 years ago and it quickly became my favourite. I have bought 300 CD's since then. It still is the best in my books. The only album that comes close is Murmur by the same band. They don't come much more timeless, introspective, and haunting than this release especially in songs like MONTY GOT A RAW DEAL and DRIVE. Also the group has perfected their songwriting ability with such gems as SIDEWINDER, MAN ON THE MOON, and IGNORELAND. IGNORELAND is a song about the downfall of america when the republicans were in power from 80-92. With George W Bush in power now, this reviewer wonders if there will be a sequel. I hope so. This album is a gem. It will go down as one of the greats and it would enhance ANY record collection. NOTE: There are many REM clones out there, but this one, hands down destroys any copiers albums. This one is unbelievable. Please email me and let me know what you think of this review. THANX.
B000051VWW|4.0|Its wonderfull when some people get toghether and make so much beautifull things. I love them. It is the way she sings, the way she dances, the way they play, the way they all seem to be. Listenning to them it is such a pleasure, you can listen while your making love, when you drive your car, when you are glad, when you are sad, when ever you want, it is always the right time to listen it. I dont know, you create high expectations and they never let you down. Their music is so pure and clean that you cant find anything so good as this. They are different and unique. All the best for them.
B000001A3H|5.0|This CD is great. Personally Sky Valley is my favorite Kyuss album but this one comes really close. 50 Million Year Trip is my favorite Kyuss song of them all and easily one of my favorite songs ever, it really is a trip you need to take, from the ferocious beginnning to the awe-inspiring guitars at the end. Other highlights include Green Machine of course, Mondo Generater, and Freeedom Run. Also Thong Song is great and I burst out laughing the first time I heard it: &quot;I.....hate.....slow songs&quot; brilliant. The last track sums up my feelings of this album brilliantly, a must-have.
B0000024RZ|5.0|My dad and aunt acutally turned me on to this CD and to Another Side of Bob Dylan.  When I get tired of the loud angry tirades of EMINEM and other rappers, I put on the quieter angry tirades of Dylan. &quot;The Lonsome Death of Hattie Carrol&quot; really touched me and I think all of his songs make points that are still valid today.  If anyone is reading my review and you're not sure whether or not to but this cd, I'll tell you buy it! You won't be disappointed.
B000002H97|2.0|Ah, Metallica's \\"breakthrough\\" CD. Yes, how wonderful it was that this great band learned how to \\"pare its excesses\\" and focus on \\"tight song structures.\\"<br />Uh, hello? I LIKED the excess on Metallica's albums. That's why they were great; they made the excess work for the music, instead of against it. This CD, called the \\"Black Album,\\" is just a dozen songs with riffs stolen from Tony Iommi and lame nursery rhyme lyrics. Sure, Hetfield's vocals only keep improving, but if I want great singing I'll listen to Elvis. <br />Maybe if half these songs hadn't been overplayed so much on the radio and MTV, I might like them. But that's not the case. This is boring arena rock, unsurprising and sterile.
B000050XEI|5.0|I love the new age, ethereal sound of Enya. She has beautiful words to say in her songs and just listening to this album can make that headache go away. From the carefree mood of &quot;Wild Child&quot; to the serious &quot;Pilgrim&quot; to the all instrumental title track &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; to the somberness of &quot;Only Time,&quot; this album was evidently made with deep thought.  Enya does not disappoint on her new releases; she took 5 years to roll out this one and it's worth giving a listen to.
B0000524CY|3.0|Namely, First Half, good; Second Half, bad.  I've always enjoyed the psychedelic, nasty flashbacks in the first half, as well as the general state of confusion the movie seems to generate:  you don't know all the characters yet; you're confused; what's up with this or that hideous image; what does IRAQ have to do with all of it . . . so forth.  This sense of discombobulation is quite effective, more so than the rather silly second half of the movie.  Linda Blair, utterly without talent, is hidden behind some  (admittedly)  great make-up -- once hidden, she spends the rest of the movie vomiting split-pea soup, spinning her head around in defiance of physics, growling with the voice of Mercedes McCambridge.  The two priests, old-fashioned Max von Sydow and young, 1960s-ish Jason Miller, are subjected to constant harrassment from the  &quot;demon&quot;  within the brat.  Every time they enter the room, something  &quot;horrible&quot;  happens.  This grows tiresome . . . and if you've seen  *The Exorcist*  more than once, utterly without suspense or even interest.<br />But that zany, somehow more evil-feeling first half of the movie is worth seeing again and again.  In any event, the mark this film has made on popular culture has been enormous -- but you have to step back from the movie's  &quot;baggage&quot;  and view it carefully.  The rewards are uneven, but it's still worth checking out.<br />[By the way, the  &quot;extra&quot;  footage was fine; what WASN'T fine was suckering people to pay theater prices to see it in re-release.]
B000051VWW|5.0|A lot of artists come and go; a lot have poorer, more deteriorated music as time rolls on, but Sade is one artist that stays true to her work, even if it took her 8 years to roll out this one. Her silky voice and deeply personal lyrics are her trademarks. She never fails to touch us with those special songs she creates for her fans. This is a much different Sade than people who remember her during the 80's. She touches several sensitive issues, from prejudice to slaves to a broken heart. A lot of people dislike this album immediately because it's not the typical Sade from the 80's, but what did you expect? Sade sings from her heart; she expresses those feelings we sometimes feel inside of us but don't dare to say aloud. It doesn't matter that it's not the typical pop sound you've heard from her in the past, don't you get it? It's the meaning behind those songs that make this album a masterpiece. Sade, thank you.
6302548195|5.0|I bought the Pumping Iron back in 1987 when I started bodybuilding at 16 years of age and from that time all the heros of that movie were an insperation and motivation in my life not only in bodybuilding. Arnold, Franco Columbo, Lou Veregno, Serge nubret, dany padilla, mike katz, robby robinson, Ed Corney, Ken Waller and every body that appeared in that movie were my heros until know I still cry when I see this movie, bodybuilding was at it's best and all bodybuilders were artists too not like the todays budybuilders and Judges, the only thing that matters to them is size and they forgot the buity of the sport of bodybuilding. THIS VIDEO IS A MUST FOR EVERY BODYBUILDER AND EVERY ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER FAN OR ANYONE LOKING FOR INSPARATION IN ANY SPORT OR IN HIS LIFE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN DVD.
B000002NHN|5.0|For me, this CD was very spiritual and meaning full. She has stories for each songs which makes listening and signing it interesting. It's a pity that she is not well-known because this is personally I think much better than Britney Spears and all the others who don't put meaning in their songs. I do my yoga with this and I look over my day, see what I did that wasn't nice..and I pray. So this CD is great. Great job, Lorenna!
6305171769|2.0|I went to the theater on the first day this movie came out.  I came out of the theater confused.  What happened to the parts 4-6?  I loved 4 and 5.  Can't say the same about 6 but Im flexible.  This movie dosen't deal with 4-6 at all.  The director, Steve Miner, &quot;totally&quot; discredited anything from the others.  In an interview I seen he just thought 4-6 was a joke.  Here's the joke:  Halloween H20.  I mean, I did like the movie.  It was fine if your a hard core Halloween fan but the fact that 4-6 never existed creates a sort of paradox and loop hole.  It's just hard to get past with actually enjoying the movie.  Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) is back and the head mistress of a school.  I never did like her.  Josh Harnett and Michelle Williams show up with there bad acting and LL cool J hurt my eyes while he was on screen.  These actors really hurt the movie for me.  I think Steve Miner seen Scream and I know what you did last summer and tried to capitilize on the target audiance.  What better way to do that then to put in these popular hopeless actors.  What's worse is that now the mysteries from what happened in part 6 will never be known. And this makes a sequale almost impossible. Hopefully Halloween 8 (which is coming out in the fall of 2001 Im told) will bring Halloween back to reality.  Don't ask me how.  I wouldn't want to be the script writer for that movie.  it will be hard to convince us Michael is still alive.  If any of you see Steve Miner or Jamie Lee Curtis walking down the street, I encourage you to punch them in the face.  They'll deserve it.  If any of you have something to say about the things I said, and I know many of you disagree with me on this movie, please E-mail me at:  omicron_30@yahoo.com
B000002UAO|5.0|By 1965, The Beatles had already conquered the world with their music, always highly-qualified, as they always tried to be innovative and fresh-sounding with their early work. But at some point they had to demonstrate that they were not only the band that had broken all the best-selling records, but also a new and never-before-seen musical structure that would eventually break down all the conventions and create a social phenomenon that would change the world foverer. <br />&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is an album where The Beatles, always guided by the hands and ears of Sir George Martin, intented to be innovative and creative, not abandoning the traditional pop music structures, but changing them to give them the shape they wanted them to have... So here we can appreciate notable instrumental superation which, in many cases, is close to perfection. We hear impressive works on guitars (&quot;Drive My Car&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, &quot;Girl&quot;, the 12-string guitar on &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;), bass guitar (&quot;You Won't See Me&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;), keyboards (Paul's piano on &quot;You Won't See Me&quot; and &quot;The Word&quot;, and George Martin's solo on &quot;In My Life&quot;), drums and percussion (Ringo's drumming on &quot;You Won't See Me&quot;, &quot;The Word&quot;, &quot;What Goes On&quot; and &quot;In My Life&quot; is amazing, as is the percussion amongst the album). They present us special innovations in the recording: a sitar playing the lead role as a popular music instrument (&quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;), a fuzz bass guitar that has a more starring role that the lead guitar (&quot;Think For Yourself&quot;), and the most trebley acoustic guitars ever heard on record (&quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, according to Paul McCartney).<br />They were also looking for lyrical perfection. &quot;Drive My Car&quot; is a collaboration between Paul and John, and a nice opener with a funny story (and it SO belongs here. The original album was the UK version!); &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot; is a very weird story about an affair John was having at the time, which finishes with a fire!; &quot;You Won't See Me&quot; and &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; are Paul McCartney's love/argument songs to Jane Asher. They are both outstanding for their lyrics (Paul shines here as a lyricist. Yes, he wrote lyrics too) and their charming melodies; &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; is one of the best John's songs, about isolation and sharing the world with all the people who live in it, and also contains a three-part vocal harmony that will be present on the entire album; &quot;Think For Yourself&quot; is a great song by George Harrison (&quot;probably about the government&quot;, he says), with a deep meaning (it's up to you to decide what it is: I think it's about not believing all the things that you hear). It also features three-part harmonies. &quot;The Word&quot; is a John Lennon song (also sung by three of the four Beatles) that has a great meaning even today, as the world still needs &quot;The Word&quot; to survive. I mean, those were other times and I didn't live there (I'm only 18), but how we need this kind of songs now! &quot;Michelle&quot; is the typical McCartney ballad, with lovely touches of french arrangements and a sweet guitar solo and background vocal harmonies; &quot;What Goes On&quot; is, in my opinion (and even considering all the love I have for Ringo Starr as a drummer, as a band member, and even as a singer and a solo artist!), the low point of the album. But it's not Ringo's fault, as he sings pretty well and his drumming does not contain any mistakes: is the guitar work that doesn't work here. I don't know what happened with John and George, but that guitars aren't right. Still a good song. &quot;Girl&quot; is a deep and melancholy lament by John, about a man losing his faith in love because of a particular girl who treated him badly. He would later take the revenge, as &quot;Run For Your Life&quot;, the closing track for the album, is a very anti-feminist although humoristic song. They both have the precise arrangements that make them strong. &quot;Wait&quot; is quite a filler, but a good one, as its lyrics are good, and the guitar is very well-played. &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; is another three-part harmony, this time on a nice George's song about love. <br />&quot;In My Life&quot; is a whole other chapter. One of my favourite songs of all-time, its sincere lyrics are just very emotional, and can mean a lot to everyone who hears them. I can't think about any song as charming, nice and sweet as this one. Also, &quot;In My Life&quot; can mean &quot;In Our Lives&quot;, as John is talking about the places he remembered, the old memories, the old friends, that can only have meaning when love is &quot;something new&quot;, when the loved person appears and makes the world go round again. It's so lovely that can make us cry. And not many songs can do that... Sweet, deep, meaningful, outstanding, delightful... A gem.<br />No matter how old are you, wherever you are, The Beatles music can have a deep impact &quot;In Your Life&quot;. &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was, I think, only the starting of the Beatles' brilliance. Musically and lirically, they were starting to grow, and the world was witnessing that process. And the new fans can now appreciate it as an whole, which makes this album, if you don't already own it, an essential addition to your CD collection. Wherever you are, no matter how old are you.
6304288433|2.0|I'll make this quick.  I like the beginning.  It starts off promising, but then it just goes down hill.  The moment Laurie enters the hospital things turn in to a bore fest.  It was scary.  I did like the movie just like every other Halloween movie. It was kind of interesting when Sam Loomis is still looking for Michael on the streets.  But the parts near the ending!!  It ruins the movie.  I could name several other problems with the movie, but I think I'll go back to watching the original Halloween and the other sequals.  Do you have to say anything about what I said about this movie?  If you do E-mail me at:  omicron_30@yahoo.com
0783231202|4.0|Amistad is an important story in American history, and the history of slavery in America. Producer Debbie Allen was the driving force behind getting Spielburg to tell this story. For those unfamiliar - and probably most are unless they have seen this movie or read reviews or seen previews of it - La Amistad was a Spanish slave ship which was used to bring Africans to Spain from Cuba. They had previously been illegally captured and shipped from Sierra Leon. Singbe Pieh (called Cinque by the Spaniards and throughout this film), broke free of his chains and freed the other slaves who then killed most of the Spanish crew and forced the two remaining to bring them back to Africa. However, things did not turn out as planned and they were captured off the coast of Road Island, and brought to New Haven, Connecticut to determine their fate. Most of the movie, thus, is about their legal fight for freedom.<br />Djimon Hounsou, seen most recently in a recurring role in the TV series E.R., played Cinque as his first acting role. He has great screen presence. He speaks almost no English throughout the movie, and thus draws us to pay much more attention to his facial gestures, and raw emotions, with which he rises to the challenge of convincing us of who Cinque is without even knowing what he is saying most of the time. Some of our insight, of course, is helped by flashbacks.<br />Anthony Hopkins is as brilliant as ever as the former-president John Quincy Adams who seems half-senile at times, while revealing at others a great intellect and awareness still churning in an old man whose day, according to many of his contemporaries, has passed.<br />Unfortunately, Morgan Freeman's character is not a very visible one, or memorable, anyway. He plays an ex-slave abolitionist of the day who is much more moderate than his white colleagues, who go so far as to espouse martyrdom over victory.<br />Matthew McConaughey plays the young, somewhat bumbling, lawyer who goes through a personal transformation - he originally sees the case as a simple property manner and solicits the case because of experience in this area. But as he becomes involved in the slaves story, he begins to view them not as property, but as people like himself. McConaughey is convincing, though not outstanding in any way.<br />I did have a few qualms about this movie. For one, it was a little long. Those with problems sitting still for long periods might have to watch this in a couple of sittings. It is a very interesting story, but a lot of it is in the courtroom dealing with legalisms and so forth. I think it probably could have been a little shorter without sacrificing a lot of the story. The two and a half hours could have probably been pared to two. The other problem I had with it was that it used the standard Spielburg tricks to elicit emotion - the soaring music, extreme close-ups, etc. I have a problem with this because I feel like I'm being manipulated. I wish Spielburg would have more trust in his story, actors, and audience and not feel he has to &quot;tell&quot; people when they should feel sad, happy, etc.transformation - he originally sees the case as a simple property manner and solicits the case because of experience in this area.

0780622553|4.0|Dark City may have been one of those pictures you never got around to seeing at the theater.  And you may have planned to rent it at one time but forgotten.  It's a terribly under-rated movie--maybe because it defies easy genre classification.  Dark City isn't science fiction in the popular Aliens or Star Wars sense, nor is it horror, nor is it the detective flick it starts out as.<br />However Dark City is a very compelling film with a terrific  premise and a well plotted story.  There are complaints on this board that the characters are too one-dimensional, but this in fact is critical to the way the story unfolds for its main character, Murdoch.  To be swayed from sampling this movie because of anyone's claim that the plot is excessively thin is to do yourself a diservice.<br />The effects in this film are universally impressive, but what's more, refreshingly integral to the story.  Both the sound and the picture are fantastic.  If you're able to watch this on a good television capable of deep blacks, you'll find yourself marveling at just how great DVD is all over again.  <br />Be warned that some of the extras listed in the product description here are somewhat underwhelming.  This &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; doesn't measure up to some of New Line's other &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; DVDs such as Boogie Nights or Magnolia.  For example, the &quot;Comparisons to Metropolis&quot; feature is a wonderful idea, but is executed here with about as much thought as goes onto the back of a cereal carton.  <br />Of the two alternate voice tracks, Roger Ebert's is actually the more insightful.  The film makers' voice track is muddled with too many participants.  You realize pretty quickly that the director, writers, production designers, and photographer recorded their comments separately.  The unfortunate result is a disjointed and repetetive commentary track.  No matter how you feel about Roger &quot;the fat one&quot; Ebert or about critics in general, he will teach yousomething you didn't know in his commentary track.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I distinctly remember watching the X-Men cartoons growing up, and reading the X-Men comics as well, and all I have to say is that the movie lived up to all my expectations and more. Granted, some of the things couldn't be simulated perfectly in the movie, and some things had to be changed around for that purpose as well, but 99.9% of the time, that's the case with movies nowadays, including Titanic, and it's won several Oscars.<br />All I have to say is this. I simply can't wait for the sequel, and I certainly hope I get to see Gambit, Beast, and several others in it.
0553106635|5.0|I'll keep this short and simple.  If you liked the first two books, you'll love the third.  If you didn't like the first two books, you'll love the third.  My god, I was starting to think series only got worse with each book (Like with Robert Jordan), but with Martin, it's only getting better.  I never know what's going to happen next.  Well of course I'll THINK i know what'll happen next, but...Wow.  That's the best way to sum up this book and this series. Wow.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I don't normally write a review for a movie, but in this case I feel that it was my duty to help negate a couple of the poor reviews that some imbeciles wrote. If you did not like this movie you have one of two conditions: You are a girl or you have no taste whatsoever. Either case you should stick with chick flicks.  This movie is on par with Braveheart, if not better. Nuff said.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This DVD set is packed with extra features, including an amazing movie. It took me ages to get through all the material included. There are some features which were shown on TLC which give some great insight into the real lives of a gladiator. I found it to be very interesting. There is also a look at some storyboards of scenes that never made it into the film. For example there is this on fight scene between a couple of Rhino's which I could understand why that didn't make it; the cgi effects for it would have cost a lot.<br />The movie itself is an epic blockbuster. Tons of awesome action sequences which keep you on the edge of your seat. Particularly the scenes in the Colesseum. This movie is a must have for anyone with a dvd player!
B000001DVV|5.0|Ugly Kid Joe came about at the tail end of the 80's metal craze,  and before they knew it, grunge hit, and they had to reevaluate their existance.  After Nirvana, anything relying on power chords, booze, and good old fashioned rock and roll had a really hard time finding an audience.  This is a pity, because even if most of these bands had little to offer, great bands like Ugly Kid Joe weren't given a fair chance.  UKJ were an amazing band (on this album anyway) that, had they been around 3 or 4 years earlier could have really made an impact.  Almost every song on this album rocks like no other, but I never understood what was so great about Everything About You, the album's weakest track.  If you want to really know what this album's about listen to Goddamn Devil or Panhandlin' Prince.  Now THIS is rock and roll.
158788108X|5.0|This book is supposed to be the sequel to &quot;From Russia with love&quot;, in fact it begins with Bond in hospital due to a life-threatening injury obtained in &quot;From Russia with love&quot; but recovers, M(Bond's boss) decides that there is no better way to get Bond back in shape than give him a &quot;simple&quot; mission in the island of Jamaica where the representative of the British Secret Service(John Strangways, who also appeared in Fleming's Bond novel &quot;Live and let die&quot;) has disappeared, Bond's mission is to find out what happened.          This &quot;soft option&quot; leads Bond to his most dangerous and thrilling mission yet and leads to him to do an &quot;obstacle course&quot;, to a fight with a squid and a fight with a &quot;dragon&quot;!       I thought this Fleming's most suspenseful book as I never could tell what would happen next and this kept me hooked, so much so that I read it all in one day!  Unfortunately, this is also Mr. Fleming's most far-fetched.  It was far-fetched in the sense that I don't think even Bond(who at that point was supposedly half-dead) could have defeated a 60-foot squid with just a dagger.  That apart it's a great, great thriller.  Read it, wonder in awe at it's elements, then read it again just to savour Fleming's writing.       Unfortunately, the movie never did the book justice.   I heard that in &quot;From Russia with love&quot; Fleming planned to simply kill off James Bond, thankfully he didn't and produced a marvellous book in Dr. No.
B000007MVM|5.0|I bought this on LP back when I was a teenager and was'nt too taken by it at the time.  Now that I'm much older I gave it another chance on CD and was struck by how much I had overlooked years ago.  This is a very unique album in that the songs are at once fragile, funny, strange and sad.  Musically Barrett was very gifted, and the songs are very lovely.  The lyrics can be hard to grasp as they don't seem to mean anything to anyone but the author.  Overall this has become one of my favortie Cd's and I listen to it often, always wishing Barrett had left us a little more than just a handfull of recordings from so long ago.
0393317552|5.0|Diamond's last book is a windfall of marvellous moments which makes you see history with new, bias-free eyes. Since I was a kid, I had always hoped that my teachers deal with a world history instead of serving us a European-focused view, but nobody ever did. With Jared Diamond's book, my dream has finally materialized in a pleasant, erudite way. In this book each continent is devoted the same importance and you can learn striking facts about a plethora of subjects such as germs and diseases, giant kangaroos or the population of Madagascar.  Certainly the best history book I have ever read, because it is made in a scientific manner. Every history addict should buy it now.
B000007OY0|5.0|Ok this movie begins with a man Andy Dufrane ( played by Tim Robbins ) who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover in cold blood. We never find out if he really did it, but personally i think he didn't. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison in the new england area. The time of the story is from the early 1950's - late 1960's. He meets a man named simply as Red ( played by Morgan Freeman ) who helps him out and becomes close friends with Andy. After serving almost 20 years of his sentence Andy tunnels through the walls to freedom and lives his dream of living next to the Pacific Ocean. Red soon comes up for parole and Andy leaves him some money and a letter at a secret spot to let him know that he would like his help starting a business on the west coast.
B000000H7I|5.0|Sure, PIERCED FROM WITHIN and BREEDING THE SPAWN are superb albums but let's face it, this is the ultimate album from SUFFOCATION! It's faster, more brutal and lyrically perfect. Frank mullen really goes all out when he sings; I especially like the song INVOLUNTARY SLAUGHTER. I love death metal and believe me when I say that this CD is a piece of art!  If you enjoy this album, you should also check out HUMAN WASTE. It may be a bit shorter but the remastered version is awesome.
B00004TRD8|1.0|After seeing &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; &quot;Alien Resurrection,&quot; &quot;Titanic,&quot; and &quot;The X-Files,&quot; among others, the effects in T2 well...suck.  It was impressive 10years ago, but now looks like a high-school media arts project.  Personally, I never even enjoyed the movie. Now, it's 100x worse.  To top it all off, who's the star?  Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Need I say more.  Don't fall into this trap.
0140277447|5.0|It is unfortunate that things like this have happened in the past and continue today. My mother is Japanese and my father is American, and I have heard about the Nanking massacre before I read Chang's book. My great-grand uncle was a Japanese soldier in Nanking, and he denounced religion after what he saw there. The heinous crimes were indeed very true, and anyone who denies them is irresponsible. However, I disagree with Chang and some other reviewers' opinions that it is Japan's moral obligation to educate its children about the massacre. They are a bit naive when it comes to understanding Japanese society. I was born in Japan and have lived there for 11 years. I have watched the teenagers of my generation become more &quot;Americanized&quot;(More independent, ignorant, arrogant, and obnoxious than before). But there is one large difference between Americans and Japanese. In America, racism is prevalent, as can be substantiated with all the racist slurs that exist. In Japan, racism in the new generations is rare, and I have yet to learn even one racist slang word in Japanese. In a recent poll, it was discovered that half of the Japanese teenagers questioned didn't know that American had ever fought Japan in a war. Although it may sound pathetic in a historical-knoledge context, I am grateful. In Japan, I have never faced any problems of racism. In America and Australia; two countries that I am or have lived in; children and teenagers seem to be fascinated with &quot;how we won the war&quot; and &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. I have seen and faced racism there, but not in Japan. I have Asian friends from around the world(including the USA) who lived in Japan, and they like it there. Although Japanese racism against Koreans and Chinese still do exist here and there, it is quickly fleeting. And it is NOTHING compared to the racism Asians face in the USA. In conclusion, I would like to say that I respect Chang's beliefs greatly, but she is still naive when describing the psyche of the Japanese people. The WW2-era generation Japanese are quickly disappering, and so are the irrational views some of them hold. Japan has already been assimilated into American culture enough, inheriting many bad traits in the process. Why should Japanese children, peaceful as they are, have to carry the burden of their ancestors? Learning their full past will only make them more nationalistic and maybe even militaristic(I have seen this happen in Japan; and for more justification, look at the typical American kid). They, as with most other children around the world, aren't ready to face the harsh truth of their nation's nefarious history. Let things be as they are. Japan is a peaceful nation now and every country should follow their example.
0440539811|5.0|Every word in this book is a lie.  Then again, so is every word you have ever heard, read, or uttered.  Given that, why not delude yourself with the high quality, entertaining lies found in THE ILLUMINATUS TRILOGY?
B00000IAU3|3.0|By now we've all heard of Dido from one source or another... weather it be from Eminem's &quot;stan&quot; or from Roswell. Well, I like &quot;thankyou&quot; and &quot;here with me&quot; but most of the album is lacking. After track 6 you almost have to force yourself to keep the cd on. On the upside Dido has an amazing voice that's reminds me of early Sarah M. stuff. Not a bad choice if you wanna kick back and relax.
B000000W5L|5.0|Once again, Gary Costello's influence pays off as he gives another 5-star Rolling Stones album, in fact, one of the greatest rock 'n' roll albums of all time, 1-star.  When will people stop criticizing one band based on another.  You cannot compare this album to The Beatles - Abbey Road.  But at the same time, Abbey Road cannot be compared to this album.  The sound acheived on them is COMPLETELY different.  Both are excellent albums, but Abbey Road is a studiowork, whereas this is essentially live, with minimal overdubs.  Both have their advantages and disadvantages.  This album is better off compared with Bob Dylan &amp; The Band's The Basement Tapes, although the songs on this album are quite different.  From the raunchy rock 'n' roll of &quot;Rocks Off&quot;, &quot;Rip This Joint&quot;, and &quot;Tumblin' Dice&quot; to the beautiful acoustic ballads &quot;Sweet Black Angel&quot; and &quot;Torn And Frayed&quot;, as well as Keith Richards brilliant &quot;Happy&quot; and so many others, this 19-track album is solid.  5-star, anything less is robbery.
B00003W8NM|4.0|When I watched this film, i coulden't stop woundering who the director was. (i was unaware of the fact that it is David Fincher) The direction was amazing and i had always liked Edward Norton, but until i saw this and twelve monkeys i hated Brad Pitt. Now i take back my hard feeling, sorry Brad. Anyway, i would recommend this to anyone who is intrested in artistic film making and the depths of the human mind.
B000002H72|5.0|I reviewed this album a while ago, but I only gave it four stars then.  I need to re-state my opinion: This is a five-star album.  By far a five-star album.  The Pixies second LP, as I've learned lately, gets better with every listen.  It begins with the schreechy guitars of DEBASER, which incorporates lead singer Black Francis' hard edged, wailing voice, with the beautiful vocals of bassist Kim Deal.  It only gets better from there, with the quit-to-loud TAME, the simply badass &quot;surfer&quot; anthem WAVE OF MUTILATION, the powerful base-lines of I BLEED, the upbeat but odd HERE COMES YOUR MAN (the most commercial the Pixies ever got), and the chilling drum beat of DEAD.  MONKEY GONE TO HEAVEN, the Pixies most popular tune, is a haunting, catchy song about the destruction of our enviroment, with the quiet wail of a string quartet in the background.  The streak continues with the fast/slow paced MR. GRIEVES, which is emerging as one of my favorite Pixies songs.  CRACKITY JONES, by far the weakest track on DOOLITTLE, is still a cool song.  LA LA LOVE YOU is dominated by David Lovering's great drum playing, and his rarely-used vocals.  NO. 13 BABY and THERE GOES MY GUN are both catchy songs with some great guitar playing.  HEY, which sounds great live, is also very catchy.  Kim Deal takes center stage on the odd, but beautiful SILVER, which makes great use of a slide guitar.  DOOLITTLE concludes strongly with GOUGE AWAY.  Overall, this is an album u can listen to all the way through without skipping one song.  Greta lyrics, catchy hooks, very kickass instrument playing, and Francis and Deal's harmonies make the Pixies the reigning band of alternative (and in my opinion, of all time).  They inspired countless other bands (NIRVANA ripped them off for SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT), andt hey deserve MUCH more credit than they get.  Buy DOOLITTLE or any other great Pixies CD and see what I'm talking about.
B00004TH83|5.0|This CD is absolutely fantastic.  Her voice and music are so invigorating and moving.  Her ballads are so beautiful they leave you in awe.  &quot;Adagio&quot; and &quot;Your Not From Here&quot;, to name a few, are absolutely breathtaking.  Every song on this CD is remarkable.  I am a little dissapointed that she hasn't had more publicity.  Her voice outshines any popular top 40 pop artist I have heard in a long time.  If &quot;Adagio&quot; was released in the US it would skyrocket to #1 faster than any other single.  She and her music are truly amazing and I look forward to her next US release.  Buy this CD - it is a guarantee and you get your $'s worth.
6305558167|5.0|Ok, its not a perfect movie, but for this movie, which covers the mythology of Arthur, Camelot and Excalibur(very very difficult to do) it succeeds remarkably well. There are scenes that are nearly perfect throughout the film. When the Knights of the Round Table first form, when Arthur and Lancelot joust, the sins of adultery scene, the 'unholy child' scene, the search for the Grail, when Perceval strips his armor and is born anew(remarkable), when Arthur and Guenevere meet one last time with some beautifully poetic dialogue, the scene where Arhur sees Merlin in his dreams while at Stonehenge at dusk, and of course the final battle. Wow, there are just so many great scenes. Probably my favorite is when Perceval casts Excalibur back into the lake and the Lady of the Lake reaches out to take it back. Then, we see another amazing scene as Arthur is seen being taken away in a boat to Avalon. I could go on and on about this film. See it in DVD, though, the widescreen vision.  A beautiful, remarkable film that few directors would even begin to attempt today. I think a younger Speilberg would be daring enough to attempt it, but I doubt he would succeed nearly as well. Zemeckis gave it a try with Sean Connery and Richard Gere. It was called First Knight. Watch that movie and then watch Excalibur and it is almost laughable how much better the latter one is... Buy this movie now, sit back and enjoy.
B000051VWW|1.0|Anyone who has heard any of Sade's previous albums has to see that she has simply lost it. The magic is gone and replication is not working. Evolution of sound here has turned sour, and it may have had an effect on her as well. I would say that she should leave hip/trip-hop beats alone, or hire some professionals to create them. Further, the &quot;dub&quot; like influences here are even worse. If this were Sade's first album, I would say that she has a Promising career ahead, but we all know that this is not the case.<br />The engineer here has no business to be in the studio and should be fired. The CD is lacking in depth and soundstage, all to all, her previous discs are sonically much more pleasant.<br />This just seems like some forced production, either to fulfill an obligation to the record label, or just to score some cash. I would give it zero stars if I could.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|This CD is a total bomb.  CA begins each song with a roller coaster of ooo-ing and ah-ing of her voice and it takes an average of 28.2 seconds from the point she starts singing until she actually utters a word.  Very unimaginative.  I have about 150 Christmas music CDs and this one will fit in bottom 20 %.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (American Gigolo, Beverly Hills Cop, Armageddon) took a minor B movie from the 70's and remade it into a big budget action flick.  Unfortunately, the updated screenplay is no better than the original, which was a meager excuse for one big car chase.<br />The story revolves around Memphis Raines (Nicholas Cage), a renowned but retired car thief pressed into service to save his brother's life.  He must steal 50 cars in a few days or his brother will be killed.  This is not a very complex or intriguing plot, but it gives Bruckheimer an opportunity to spend $90 million wrecking expensive cars.  The dialogue is vapid, something to fill the time between action sequences, which are quite spectacular.<br />Director Dominic Sena, (Kalifornia) got an opportunity to direct his first megabuck film and did a fine job on the stunts.  This film didn't offer much opportunity for nuance; so he did well with the project he was given.  The car chase scenes were spectacular especially the car jump on the bridge.<br />Nicholas Cage and Giovanni Ribisi are wasted in a film with few good lines.  Cage did a lot of his own stunt driving, which was impressive, but he didn't have a lot with which to work with such a shallow character.  Angelina Jolie is just a throw-in to up the testosterone factor.  The best acting performance is probably that of Delroy Lindo as the frustrated detective.<br />This unabashed guy flick is nothing more than a dressed up B movie for action junkies.  I rated it a 6/10 on the strength of the car scenes.  It delivers plenty of heart pounding action, but if you like a movie with a plot, it falls disappointingly short.
0446605409|4.0|Convalescing from three bullet wounds on the North Fork of Long Island, NYPD cop John Corey is caught up in the murder of two friends.  It's a wild ride, especially toward the end. There is plenty of action and the superior dialog that is DeMille's  trademark.  The story does bog down in a few places.  The tour of the lab on Plum Island, for instance, was probably necessary to the story, but was a little tedious.  However, the clever wit and humor of DeMille's writing helps to pull the reader along.  John Corey is a great new character and I'm looking forward to reading his future adventures.
B00002MZ12|5.0|I think this album is great, especially for those of you who are already fans.  If you're not, and you don't know which Alanis album to get first, I strongly suggest Jagged Little Pill and then Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.  If you like the music and lyrics on those two, then you'll enjoy Unplugged.  Her cover of the Police's &quot;King of Pain&quot; is hauntingly great, and the previously unreleased versions of No Pressure Over Cappucino, These R The Thoughts, and Princes Familiar are fantastic.
B00003CWPR|1.0|Save your money, this movie is sick.  I like Tom Cruise (or used to) but this is awful.
B000002ADT|5.0|What more can be said about the greatest single jazz recording ever made?  I know it's almost a cliche' to say that about this album, but like very few others, i.e. Coltrane's &quot;Love Supreme&quot;, this albums rises above mere music, it is magical and transcends the genre'.  Miles Davis came into this recording session with only sketches of songs in a modal setting and knew that with the best of the best artists he had along side himself, that the improvisation would be other worldly.  But admittedly even Miles himself didn't realize just how influential this recording would be.  Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Julian Adderly, Bill Evans/Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers and Philly Joe created the perfect album.  It will live long beyond us.  Any jazz collection begins and ends with &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;.
0767802470|5.0|If you liked Run Silent-Run Deep, and liked The Hunt for Red October - this movie is for you. The special effects and filming are first rate and the story line follows those of the classics and are more true to history. If you want to &quot;experience&quot; what it was like to be on a U-boat - this is the movie of choice. Much better than U-571.  While a long movie, you never fall asleep. My favorite sub movie.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|What an amazing CD!!  What an incredible band!! It's too bad that there aren't more artists like them.  I hope A-Ha will come out with another CD soon.
B000002N2Z|5.0|The Deftones have turned into one of the best bands in the entire rock/metal scene, and this debut is a testament to how great they are. It's the heaviest of the three they have, and has more of a rapcore sound in some of the songs, but is still undeniably them. Chino's voice is great here, he goes all over the place in his delivery, from haunting melodic vocals to fast paced raps to piercing screams, all within about the first minute of the song. Stephen Carpenter is a great guitarist, he's not flashy at all, but he writes some of the heaviest riffs I've ever heard. He also writes melodically to compliment Chino's voice, and that can add so much more to the song than just going off of the riff the whole time. Chi Cheng and Abe Cunningham are one of the most solid rhythm sections out there, and nowhere is it more evident than here. They hold down a rock solid background, but leave plenty of room for experimentation. What makes all of this so great is how all of these guys work as a unit, rather than four individuals trying to make something work that can't. They each compliment each other and blend together like no other band can, making the music that much better. You can't call yourself a fan of the Deftones if you don't have this.
6302256704|5.0|This movie is utterly genious.. i have but one question.. WHERE IS THE DVD??
B000051VWW|5.0|I was given this album as a gift and it I can't stop playing it.  It is so great that she is as lovely as ever.  I gave the gift to a friend after falling in love with it and she told me the two times I have passed by her dorm, she has been listening to it.  I hope that Sade doesn't go through another 8 year hiatus.  For anyone who is wants to listen to get lost in a song, buy this album and you'll get lost in 11.
B000002IZM|5.0|I searched for this soundtrack for many, many years.  It was one of about ten CDs that I used to look for whenever I visited a new location or city. One day, in 1995, as I was going through my standard &quot;dream CD&quot; search in a new music store, I found it.  I didn't realize that it had only come out the previous year.  I was absolutely transfixed by it.  This release is beautifully haunting, and is it definitely my favorite soundtrack of all time (although &quot;Conan: the Barbarian&quot; and &quot;Braveheart&quot; come close.&quot;      There are a few moments in &quot;Main Titles&quot; that affect me at an emotional level that I can't even describe, and surprisingly enough, one of my favorite tracks, &quot;Rachel's Song&quot; isn't even in the film.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is even considering the purchase.  It's well worth it.
B000002897|5.0|This album is better than anything by Soundgarden or Mudhoney and yet this band never got half the recognition of either of them.(Screaming Trees were from Seattle, too...I wouldn't call them grunge tho. The guitar work is much more....varied...than in most Grunge). A bloody shame they weren't hailed as the best thing since sliced bread (if, indeed, sliced bread is all it's..er....cracked up to be..)because they were really, really good. Mark has a wonderful voice and the guitars were psychedelic and heavy metal and just GOOD. It's hard to see anyone not liking it, really. I guess the Trees just got lost in the shuffle somewhere... If you get this album you won't be disappointed, seriously. This is one 8-year-old album that will never sound dated. So sad they broke up.
B000007T1M|5.0|When i first heard System of a Down i was blown away by their unique sound, heavy riffs and Serj Tankian's amazing singing voice, where he ranges from epic wails of emotion to quick maniacal singing to ear throbbing screams in one breath. The music features complex arrangements, and the trio of Shavo Odajin (bass), Daron Malakian (Guitars) and John Dalmayan (drums)are incredibly tight and focused and the added use of programming creates another element of surprise to one of metals most original sounding bands.<br />The first track Suite-pee is excellent as is Know, Sugar, War?, Peephole and Cubert but the tracks that stand out the most on this brilliant album are the explosive Soil (with awesome guitar solo), the beautiful ballad Spiders and the political album closer P.L.U.C.K. Also pick up Loud Rocks, Strait-Up and Nativity in Black 2 which feature more madness from this awesome quartet.
B000002UAO|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CD`S OF ALL TIME.THERES ONLY ONE WORD FOR THIS,GREAT.THIS HAS SOME GREAT CLASSIC`S ON IT WITHGIRL,NORWEGIAN WOOD,NOWHERE MAN AND MICHELLE.THIS CD IS THE FIRST CD THE BEATLES MADE AFTER THEY START EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT DRUGS AND IT SHOWS .THERE CREATIVITY IS WAY UP ON THIS ONE,GOING FROM SIMPLE LOVE SONGS TO MUCH MORE COMPLICATED LYRICS.THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY SILVER BEATLES FAN.THIS IS A TIMELESS CLASSIC,BUY IT.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|Slipknot are on a entirely different level to all the nu metal bands out there. This self titled debut has kicked up a storm all across the world, but thankfully i dont think they will ever sellout. All the content on this album is awesome. Slipknot are great musicians. The drumming from Joey defies belief at times, the guitars, particularly the lead guitarist have a chunky, extremely heavy sound, and the DJ and sampler provide some extra layers to Slipknots water tight sound. Some of the music verges on death metal but vocalist Corey has a great range from the maniacal sreams on the eerie tattered &amp; torn to all out death metal sreaming on songs like (sic), eyeless, surfacing and liberate.  The melodic wait and bleed the catchy only one &amp; no life further showcase Slipknots awesome musical talent and Corey's vocal diversity. This album is a must for any true metal fan.<br />Buy this and anything from Machine Head, Pantera, Fear Factory, Snot, Spineshank and Soulfly.
B000002J1C|4.0|&quot;The Yes Album&quot; is the band's first insight into the realm of progressive rock, and they make good use of the genre in the tracks &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot; and &quot;Starship Trooper&quot;, especially in the rousing, hard-line finish provided in the suite c &quot;Wurm&quot;. Much sageful wisdom is found in &quot;I've Seen All Good People&quot;, with the majority of those sageful lyrics contained in the suite a &quot;Your Move&quot;, and an oft-repetitive nature contained in the suite b &quot;All Good People&quot;. Just when the progressivism of &quot;The Yes Album&quot; is being jump-started, the rhythm of the CD is slowed down considerably with &quot;A Venture&quot;, but is revived somewhat through the nonchalant embracings of &quot;Perpetual Change&quot;. Although the band is learning its craft quite nicely, it would take their next effort for Yes to achieve their full potential in the world of progressive rock. &quot;The Yes Album&quot; would be Tony Kaye's last album with the group (although he would rejoin several years later). His place would be taken by the equally talented Rick Wakeman. For the avid listener looking to get an insight into the band's progressive-rock roots, or if you just need an art-rock fixation, look no further than &quot;The Yes Album&quot;, a CD that's sure to please even the most discriminate music fan and Yes fan alike.
B000001Y42|5.0|Before Limp Bizkit became generic rap/metal sellouts they released this album, there debut. This will always remain one of the only credible albums in the genre and even know i've heard it many times it is still a worthy part of my CD collection. The production is not up to the same standard as later releases but Fred's songwriting is more intelligent and meaningful and his singing has greater range and is far less annoying.  The guitars have a heavy but raw, jagged sound, the bass is quite good, drummer John Otto shines throughout the album, particularly with the jazzy percussion on album highlight Stuck and DJ Lethal, though i feel he is under used by LB, produces some fine scratches.<br />The best tracks are Stuck, Pollution, Counterfeit, Stalemate and Clunk (with its wicked bassline)but Leech (demo),sour, Nobody Loves me and the hit single Faith are all worth a listen. Get this album as well as both of (Hed)pe's CD's and Snot.
6305126062|5.0|This movie was really sad, touching, and a must see. I almost cried when Grace's best friend died!!
6304698658|4.0|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation has become a holiday tradition in my home. As many times as I've seen this movie I still laugh. There's good old cousin Eddie and his clan, the in-laws, the house covered with lights, (that don't light), an exploding turkey, and of course the squirrel. Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid play off each other perfectly. Then there's the long-suffering ever-faithful Beverly D'Angelo, who relates as Chevy's wife identically as Marge Simpson relates to Homer. The only advantage to owning this movie on DVD is the durability factor. As other reviewer's have mentioned, the DVD picture quality is poor. Besides a grainy picture, the DVD contains no extras, unless you consider a movie trailer to be a special feature. I certainly do not consider a movie trailer a big deal. There will most likely be a &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; released some day that will boast a better picture and added features; seems to be a trend with some of these DVD's. Patience is truly a virtue. Happy Holidays!
B00000269G|5.0|One of the greatest live jazz performances ever recorded.
B00004W3MS|5.0|this album is so beautiful that i can't even express the feelings i get when i listen to this cd.<br />all i can say is put this cd on with headphones, sit in the dark, and feel your nipples get hard cuz this cd will give you chills throughout your body.
B00004XPP0|5.0|I might as well give my say as well. I'm tired of VHS. It's past time to release this excelent series on DVD. I know, I heard that Lucas says no DVD until they are all released. This puts the DVD release date in early 2006. That is crazy. Put them out NOW!!!
0811826848|5.0|I'm not ashamed to admit it.  I am a Beatlemaniac. They weren't of my era growing up in the 70's but I didn't care.  While my friends were chiding me for being so behind the times, I for once didn't listen to peer pressure. I took my Beatle habit underground until I got old enough to realize..if you don't dig the Beatles, I can't be your friend.       I'm old now, 38, and I don't have time for the lovable mop tops.   But every once in awhile, something happens that sends me back to the &quot;comfort music&quot; of the Beatles.  This incredible book has got me going again and reminding me why I loved them.  With the perspective of being inside the band, the stories and the photos are like nothing else.  So much has been written about them, it's refreshing and timely to have the four members speak out.  The interviews with John were so well edited and all four of them had incredible insight that time wisdom and age have cristalized into this masterpeice of pop culture, music and history.    No wonder the Beatles 1 album tops the charts, knocking of the BackStreet Boy franchise.  It proves in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make.!
B00000DCHI|5.0|This CD covers all of his greatest works before it came out. There are not any bad songs on it and it most of them are outstanding. It includes great songs such as Piano Man, New York State of Mind, Only the Good Die Young, Movin' Out, You May be Right, and many other of his best works.        It also includes two previously unrealesed songs, Your Only Human (Second Wing), and The Night is Still Young. Both are great additions to the CD. Though it is a bit expensive, if you are a fan or like any of his older songs that you have heard, i would recomend it to you
B000001EAQ|3.0|A lot of people hate this album, but this is clearly still U2 here...they have just elected to use a bit of computers and synth to add to their signature sound.  While the first several tracks &quot;Discotheque,&quot; &quot;Do You Feel Loved,&quot; &amp; &quot;Mofo&quot; are very techno feeling, things begin to settle down after a while.  <br />&quot;If God Will Send His Angel&quot; is a slow and beautiful little ditty, that reminds me of &quot;Stay.&quot;  &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot; will go down as a U2 classic.  &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot; is a hard-rocker and one of my favorite on the CD.  The lyrics on that one are good too.<br />The second half of the CD is a little less accessible, but there are still some really good songs on it.  The bassline in &quot;Gone&quot; reminds me of &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; and the piano part is remniscent of &quot;New Year's Day.&quot;  &quot;Miami,&quot; perhaps the most quirky and strange song on the album is also one of the best.  The song is especially great in concert.  &quot;Miami&quot; is the epitome of what U2 is railing against in the excesses of pop culture (no pun intended.)<br />At this point the CD quietly fades out with a series of quieter songs: &quot;If you Wear That Velvet Dress,&quot; &quot;Please,&quot; and &quot;Wake Up Dead Man.&quot;  There is certainly better U2 on the market (&quot;Achtung Baby being the pinnacle of their work in my opinion) but there is certainly worse (their pre-Unforgettable Fire days are almost completely forgettable to me.)<br />Overall a pretty good disc, if you are only going to own a few U2 CDs, I would avoid it, but if you want to go deeper, then by all means, pick it up.
0062502182|1.0|What a load of crap. I read this book because my girlfriend bought it for me as a gift. I have to say that it is the worst gift I have ever received. This is nothing but a buch of new age spiritual mumbo jumbo. &quot;The boy reached through to the Soul of the World and saw that it was part of the Soul of God. And he saw that the Soul of God was his own soul. And that he, a boy, could perform miracles.&quot; Ugh!<br />Fortunately the book is short. When you finish you're just glad that it wasn't longer and wasted even more of your time.
B000000Y87|5.0|Sunday at the Village Vanguard was actually my 3rd or 4th jazz album ever purchased--unheard, on the basis of print reviews--but it rewarded the risk by opening up my head to the jazz world in such a lovely, exciting, and earthshaking way.  I owe so much on a personal level as a listener and as a musician to this album.<br />The three primary reasons behind my love for this album are Gloria's Step, Jade Visions, and especially Alice in Wonderland.  (It's hard not to wave my hands around in clumsy layperson conducting on that last one! :-)  You simply cannot describe Bill Evans' exquisite _touch_ that sculpts so much tenderness on that tune in particular, but also just about everything Evans touches.  Bassist La Faro really cemented on this record his reputation as a monster, demonstrating that it was possible to maintain a head (melody) almost as as an interactive solo with a piano lead without wrecking the form or playing too stridently there or in his own killer solos.  (Incidentally, Motian may seem the weakest link because he's not flashy at all, but he is the steady, unobtrusive pillar on which the magnificence rests, smart enough to dish out sublime atmospheric support on his brushes and stay out of the way of his partners in crime.)<br />The other tunes on this album are great, too, but the three I listed above just make my world go round.  They're likely to do the same to you, too, turning on, if it isn't ignited already, the jazz &quot;light&quot; in your head for all time.<br />Note:  this album's contents were cut to feature La Faro in light of his famous tragic passing ten days later.  The same gig also supplied the material for _Waltz for Debby_, an equally excellent album with the same trio that's more indicative of their usual dynamics at that time.  Buy both; you need them to salve your soul.  :-)  To the casual listener with a beginning curiosity about jazz:  if you're paying the slightest bit of attention to what's going on, you will realize this disc is the real deal, not lounge lizard music at all.  As long as your ears are open, your mind and heart will follow.<br />There is plenty of ambient audience and waitstaff noise in the background, but the music still cuts through with plenty of quiet power to spare.  Some of the passages are so sweet that I scratch my head, wondering how the Vanguard clientele could have been so apparently oblivious at times to the history being made in front of them.  This is hands-down five star stuff, and deserves far more than that!
B00004U30D|5.0|This movie is so special because it's so different. It's like no other movie ever made. It contains beautiful acting, brilliant writing, and is so incredibly touching. Each character has a little fragment of everyones personality put together, so on some level you can relate with all of them. No matter how many times I see this movie it will continue to inspire me.
6305313687|4.0|Reccomended to me by a friend, I really did not know what to expect with this film (although Ed Norton on the box with a shaved-head &amp; a 'white power' tattoo on his shoulder gave me a rough guess), so I had an open mind before I saw it.  (basic plot) The film is set in a neighbourhood in Venice, LA County, California.  After losing his father to a heartless gang-related shooting in Compton, where his dad was putting out a fire at a dealer's house, Derek (Ed Norton) takes a turn for the worse. A turn which sees him adopt the views of neo-Nazist Aerian supremacy. This bad turn in his life culminates in the hatred-fuelled murder of two Afro-American gangstas trying to steal his car one night. Needless to say, he winds up in the local correctional facility, and a whole bundle of laughs it ain't. Derek comes out a changed man (with the help of his ex-teacher, and a laundry-duty black con, who comes to be Derek's best friend inside), and knows he has to show his brother Danny (Edward furlong) the error of his ways before one of the local gun-toting gang-members decides white supremacists and black people don't mix, and does a nasty on one of them.  I can see why Norton was nominated for an oscar, his performance is chillingly real, and his acting is so convincing that even the most un-racist person will see the apparent logic behind some of his ideas, such as the contraversial Rodney king incident. Although obviously I'm not saying they're right, of course the whole point is that they aren't, but Norton's acting is persuasive enough to make you question your own opinion, if only (I hope) for the duration of the film.  Norton gained 30lbs of muscle for the role, and the skinhead, tattooed look helped him live his role as one of venice Beach's most violent men. He genuinely looks like the type of person who, with the backing of his gang of skinheads (portrayed in a particularly dumb light in this film, which could be a good thing) could square up to any of the neighbourhood Hispanic or African-American gangs. And it is this fearsomely efficient &amp; muscular physique, adorned with racist imagery, coupled with his sharp intelligence (he was a good student before he started all this rubbish) and supremacist views that, in his mind, justify the most brutal acts, that make him so dangerous.  Some viewers may find some of the scenes particularly heartless, but that is why they are there, to show the viewer how heartless hatred, fuelled by faulty ideas, can lead to tragedy. Taken for what it is, the film is pretty negative, but when reading between the lines you will see the positive message that the director intended you to.  It will make you think, and it will probably shock you, but get a copy of this and you won't be wishing you hadn't. A definite must see.
B000021Y74|5.0|I first wanted to see this movie from reviews in the newspaper. Once I saw it, I experienced true movie bliss. It's a fast paced high adrenaline joy ride. Franka Potente shines as the gorgeous Lola, who has 20 minutes to save her boyfriend. The movie plays in actual time and unfolds beautifully. This movie is in German, but you quickly adjust to the subtitles. I could pontificate forever on the genius of this movie, but that wouldn't benefit anyone, so I won't.
B00004SZWD|5.0|There is no contest,STEVIE WONDER is the greatest soul artist of the seventies.All the grammys he won during that decade were all deserving this truely great artist.Although i prefer INNERVISIONS, SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE is also a great double album ,that manages to satisfy all of STEVIE'S fans.Great singles:SIR DUKE,I WISH and ISN'T SHE LOVELY;Great ballads:VILLAGE GHETTO LAND and PASTIME PARADISE;Great musical feast:CONTUSION and ANOTHER STAR.Four years will pass before STEVIE'S next's present time paradise in 1980.Waiting for STEVIE WONDER is always rewarding, because indeed, they are very few like him.
0553296981|1.0|I speaking as a 14 year old girl hated this book. I was forced to read it in 8th grade and it was a pretty good book but after a while it got very boring. I understand that this a horrific part of our history but come after so long of hearing about the same things a teenager will loose interest. So for those of you who are considering buying this book for enjoyment please reconsider for making your teenager read it.
0783241569|4.0|If you don't expect a smash, then you'll enjoy NOTHING HILL(if you care, MADONNA lives there)but i still think it could have been better, and i liked FOUR WEDDINGS more.The charms of JULIA and HUGH makes up for the shortcomings of the script, that is never really beleivable.It's like going to a restaurant ,and after you've eaten the entree, you wait forever for the principal meal that never comes.
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|&quot;Scary Movie&quot; is getting a lot of comparisons to &quot;Airplane&quot; and its spiritual descendants, the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; movies. And while that's cleary what's intended, &quot;Scary Movie&quot; falls far short of the mark.<br />For one thing, the secret to the success of &quot;Airplane&quot; wasn't that every joke was a gem. Rather, the jokes came so fast and furious that you eventually found one that made you cry with laughter. And with multiple jokes a minute, that ended up being a pretty good amount of laughs.<br />&quot;Scary Movie,&quot; though, is a Wayans brothers film, and is paced more like the superior &quot;I'm Gonna Get You Sucka,&quot; which took on the blacksploitation film genre. In both films, a great deal of time is spent recreating an authentic environment -- much of &quot;Scary Movie&quot; is shot-for-shot identical to &quot;Scream&quot; or &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; -- and inviting the audience to laugh at it. That works for &quot;I'm Gonna Get You Sucka&quot; -- the films of the 1970s were already so ridiculous that only time and distance were needed to make them hilarious -- but not so well for &quot;Scary Movie,&quot; as nothing's particularly funny about looking out of the back window of Carmen Electra's house and seeing the exact same shot of the backyard pool that opened &quot;Scream.&quot; It's technically impressive, but not funny in itself.<br />Beyond that, the Wayans brothers this time around are obsessed with male genetalia, homosexuality and women's feelings about oral sex, with a few fart jokes thrown in. If that's the height of humor to you, grab this movie, and godspeed. But if you are hoping there's more, the bad news is that there's not much else to recommend this movie. We get some spot-on impersonations of the actors of &quot;Scream&quot; and IKWYDLS, some surprising non-horror spoofs tossed in (including one very nice one for when the real killer is revealed) and several scenes that have good shock value to them, but if you know they're coming, they're really not all that funny. (The movie theater bathroom scene parodying the opening of &quot;Scream 2&quot; could have been much funnier if the writing had actually gone farther than it did, which is unusual for a movie that doesn't otherwise ever NOT go too far.)<br />The biggest surprise of this movie, really, is Carmen Electra, in this film's counterpart role to that of Drew Barrymore in the original &quot;Scream.&quot; For the first time ever, she shows that she can actually act. She also gleefully tears into her own public persona, from the men she &quot;dates&quot; to the secret of her career-making figure. The movie is diminished once her part ends, and -- hard to believe I'm saying this -- hopefully some director will have noticed what she does in this movie and gives her a chance to be more than a sexpot in some other film.<br />None of this is to say that &quot;Scary Movie&quot; is a bad movie -- my wife and I are big fans of the &quot;Scream&quot; series (well, the first two, at least), and we found this to be a fun rental -- but it just doesn't merit repeat viewings like &quot;Airplane,&quot; &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; or &quot;I'm Gonna Get You Sucka&quot; do.<br />This is a rental.shock value to them, but if you know they're coming, they're really not all that funny.

0679879269|5.0|I don't know about alot of you, but I loved this book more than most books. In my 15 years I've read alot books and never has one affected me as this book affected me.    This book is one of the most passionate, wild books i've ever read. The Golden Compass and The Sublte Knife were also great books, but they were books that I had picked up and read. When I had finished reading those books I waited for The Amber Spyglass to come out and finally I was able to read it and I was astonished. That this book could affect me as no other book has. I was so happy to see that Lyra was going to be okey at the beginning af the book and then it got complicated and sad so sad. When Lyra had to make her sacrifice I felt for and Pan.     But it was the ending that had captured me and had me crying with them. To find love so strong and then to leave it. The ending was so sad but the courage that they both showed was great. I won't tell any more but i do say that this book is the greatest book I have ever read.
B0000508U6|5.0|I don't how Britain does it but that country keeps churning out great artists and bands like PJ Harvey, Radiohead, Badly Drawn Boy and now Coldplay. I see that some of the reviewers here have compared Coldplay with the likes of Travis and Radiohead. I must say that this band sounds nothing like Travis and Radiohead. Coldplay is a band of it's own entity. Of course I bought this cd because of the song &quot;Yellow&quot; but I quickly found out just how great the rest of the cd is.
B00004Z459|5.0|You know, after Rage Against The Machine broke up and Kid Rock hadn't put out a NEW cd in a long time, I was convinced rap/rock was dead and Limp Bizkit would continue to have undeserved success and rule a dead genre. While Linkin Park is no Rage, this is a great cd that puts most rap/rockers out there to shame. The unique combination of two skilled vocalists sets them apart from the other garbage out there. Definitely worth buying.
630529142X|4.0|I'm not sure if I want to subconsciously act out as Sandler's character does in the movie (in the same vein has Happy Gilmore) but Waterboy and Happy Gilmore are probably his best movies.  If you like movies where the character &quot;snaps&quot; this is top notch.  And hey, how can you not like seeing Fonzi?<br />&gt;o'
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|This film is largely unsuccessful, even as a parody.  I will admit, there were some moderately shocking parts (like the breast implant scene and the semen scene), which were sometimes funny, and the brief parody of The Usual Suspects was well-done, but these were few and far between.  None of the characters grabbed me in any way, particularly &quot;Doofy&quot; - who seems to have walked right off of the bar napkin of some drunken writer.  I might give this 3 stars if I was 11.  For a 90-minute movie, it was 80 minutes too long.  At least rent it before you buy it.
B000025APX|4.0|I love amon amarths form of death/viking metal, but once sent was far superior to the avenger.  A little longer, a little more technical, and a little more melodically interesting, all these things once sent from the golden hall was.  With drummer martin lopez gone for opeth, the technicality of the music definatley suffers.  The sound quality sounds somewhat weaker, the lyrics a little more uninteresting and the guitar riffs less eoically melodic.  Still a very good cd, especially the 1st 3 tracks, but the title track is worthless, and all around, it is definatley a step in the wrong direction for amon amarth.
B00003CX8J|1.0|If you are 12 years old you may like this movie but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone much older. The story is vague to nonexistant and the acting is very simple. If not for the visual effects the movie would probably have never made an impression at all.
6304765789|3.0|This movie is a definite mind game that keeps you guessing. Completly different than what I was expecting. A great movie if you like to be on the edge of your seat, but at the end you feel almost taken by the stupidity of the flick. I would reccommend to rent, but not to buy.
B000002U82|5.0|How can you describe the most amazing musical expierence of all time.  This album is not only the greastest album by Pink, but a true classic to anyone.  It should be in everyone's cd case.
B0000013GT|5.0|Possibly the least liked outkast album, but in my opinion the best.  You cannot deny the fact that this album can rest your soul.  I have listened to ATLiens many times, and every time I do, i find something new to enjoy about this &quot;Thought provoking album&quot; as quoted by Andre Benjamin.  The intro is very soothing and prepares you for the lyrical journey ahead.  Two dope boyz, Title track, Wheelz of steel, and Elevators are all hits that everyone has heard before, but the tracks that are forgotten are the ones that make the album.  Mainstream, easily the best collaboration between Outkast and Goodie Mob is increadable.  Word of advice, buy and listen to this album it can't disapoint.
0345350499|5.0|I literally could not put this book down. The story is captivating. I was also able to gain a historical perspective on this time period and on pre-Christian spiritual philosophy. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about Druidic religious philosophy, wants to gain insight into the time period of King Arthur, or just wants to read a great book!
B000001EYW|5.0|What a brilliant album...these guys show that they still have it! Every song is so catchy, and the harmonies haunting and wonderful. I became a fan of the Bee Gees back when Saturday Night Fever came out, like a lot of people did. Then they became &quot;not cool&quot; to like (or to admit that you liked them anyway). Unfortunately, teenagers can be easily swayed. Anyway, now its many years later, and I got this album as a gift. My first thought was &quot;oh no&quot; (left-over late-teen-kind-of-thinking, I'm afraid). Anyway, when I put it in the stereo..wow. Back came all the magic that I felt when I first loved them. How could I have said once, that they were uncool. Silly me! These guys are brilliant...if you were ever afraid as a young person to admit that you liked these guys...please, do yourself a favour and give this album a listen. I promise that you won't be disappointed.
B000001Y5X|5.0|Most of these songs were written by Marilyn Manson And The Spooky Kids, a long while back. Before The Fallen Angel, before Omega and the Mechanical Animals, before Adam and the revolution. These are songs which tell society as it is, while making fun of it. The bumpy ride beings on Prelude, a demented Willy Wonka rip-off. The singles: Lunchbox, and Get Your Gunn speak of a young boy being picked on and a woman suffering abuse from her husband. Other songs talk about how our youth will follow anything and the &quot;average&quot; family. It really is a Portrait Of An American Family. The strongest tracks are Lunchbox, Get Your Gunn, Dope Hat, and Misery Machine. If you want the glam of Mechanical Animals, or the industrial Hell of Antichrist Superstar, this album is NOT for you. This has a fresh and unique sound not duplicated on any other Manson album. This is truely where the saga began.
B000008JUM|4.0|This album has some fantastic big name artists adding their own unique touches to some of Cole Porter's most loved songs. Some are sung true to form, others like the Neneh Cherry &quot;I've got you under my skin&quot; has a complete re-working, but no matter what, each and every track is great....except one. When I first heard it, I thought my stereo had broken. And that track is &quot;It's alright with me&quot; performed by Tom Waits. Is this guy for real? He sounds like Louis Armstrong would sound if he was strung out on booze and drugs. No...forgive me...Louis would still sound better. Too bad there's no sample for you to hear. Maybe you should just buy it...you must hear it. It's good for a laugh anyway...lol. I just cannot stress enough how unbelievable that track is...it's been 2 years since I got the album and I'm still in shock. Even the background music sounds sludgy, the kind that would be played at a satanic ritual or something. And like a previous reviewer stated, just when you think its over and you can relax again...back comes his voice at full force to grab you by the throat and squeeze...aarrgghh!!!
B00004TRD8|5.0|Fantastic DVD, for the Extended Special Edition with alternate ending go to the special edition menu and key in &quot;82997&quot; - August 29th 1997...

B000002MFE|5.0|I love Clapton and have so many of his albums, but this album is special. Stripped of all electric, Clapton's guitar work really shines through. For example, listen to the wonderful instrumental, &quot;Signe&quot;. Truly beautiful. It is really nice to also hear my old favourites like &quot;Layla&quot; and &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; given the accoustic treatment. Not to mention his classic blues songs. One of the highlights for me is the swaying blues &quot;Nobody knows you when you're down and out&quot;. Listen to the wonderful keyboard playing of Chuck Leavell on that track. Along with Erics guitar it's a classic. If you're a Clapton fan and still don't own this, you are really missing out. It's a must.
B00004Z459|5.0|yo, if you are fans of deftones, incubus, green day, limp bizkit, and creed, than this is a perfect cd for you, every song is great! if you saw one step closer on mtv, and you think THAT is good, well but the cd and listen to the rest of it, trust me, you will be pleased with what you got. THANK YOU HEIDI
B000006NUW|5.0|The 1st box set of The Motown Singles Collection. And wow, if you love this one like I do, you will love the 2nd Box Set too that covers the period from 1972 to 1992. In fact, who cannot love these songs? This collection features all the big names and their hits, like Stevie Wonder, and The Temptations, but also some lesser known artists who had a hit or two, like The Monitors, and Chris Clark. It also comes with a 68 page book packed with photos, essays and track-by-track annotations. Just listening to these songs makes you feel like getting up and dancing. Highly recommended!
6304119046|3.0|I took precious time out of my schedule to watch this &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and found it acceptable.  I had a nice time viewing this film, eating popcorn and drinking generic soda.  The girl I sat with, more than a friend and less than a romantic interest, also had a pleasent evening.  I felt that the ending was both enjoyable and unfortunate.  If you liked this movie as much as I did, which was only an average amount, check out Gator.
B00000163G|5.0|this cd has some great lyrics that speak the truth, unlike other people who rap about nothing all the time. his first disc as a lot of great songs, like americas most wanted, how do u want it, only god can judge me, tradin' war stories, and on the second disc are some really good songs also. this is the best double disc cd ive ever seen. keep it up tupac, and dont stop now. youve got some phat beats.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Even considering the amount of material out there, The Beatles #1 leaves a buyer in for a good time.  I personally, have bought SKADS of Beatles records / casettes / 8-Tracks and or CDs over the years. This particular album, 1,is a masterpiece unto itself.  It contains 27 REMASTERED tracks which leave the Fab 4 sounding as fresh as ever.  For the younger listeners out there, I suggest that you give it a try.  You SHANT be dissapointed!
B000050XEI|2.0|I really liked her first two albums. I also liked her in Clannad. But now her sound is becoming a blur. I guess she has found her audience and hasn't bored them to death yet. Enya seems to still  sell albums.
0380002930|5.0|At a glance, it seems just another talking animal-fantasy book. In actuality, the book combines animal science with imaginary culture to give you a blend of emotion and adventure you will never forget. I thought it was so good, I wrote a song about it.
B00000ICD9|1.0|if i could, i would give this 0 stars. thankfully robin williams played in it or it would suck even more then does. my dad said he saw the coming attractions for this movie and it looked pretty good, so my family went to see it in the theaters.  well, in about the 20 minutes the whole family dies. then, the rest is just so confusing and very hard to follow. i think the movie had really good graphics, but the whole storie line was horrible.  sorry but this is not a have-to-see movie.
0679879269|5.0|Philipp Pullman has pulled a masterpiece out of his magic hat once again, this one topping all of the others of the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; series.  I have very little to say because reading this is an experience one cannot be told about.  This book touched my heart so much I found myself in tears by the end of how amazing life really is.  It just made me think about what is watching over us and how we, as people, watch over each other.  It really makes one think about the importance of they're relationships with people, it gave me a better insight to life, love, loss, and happiness.  The Amber Spyglass is a truely incredible book.
B000002MFN|4.0|My 'career' as a dance club DJ began around '85, shortly after Madonna's career took off for the stratosphere.  And since I was working with my own collection and trying to satisfy a fair variety of listeners, I was lucky to discover Madonna's near-universal appeal with dancers.  I count myself among her early fans, and have followed each new release (musical or theatrical) with growing satisfaction.  Strangely, I never thought of Madonna as an &quot;album artist,&quot; so much as a hitmaker.  That is, until I bought &quot;Erotica.&quot;<br />The daring progression of musical styles and themes that mark her first half dozen albums is brought to fruition with &quot;Erotica.&quot;  While some critics and non-fans saw the album (and accompanying &quot;Sex&quot; book) as an inevitable decline into decadence, &quot;Erotica&quot; is a literate and thoughtful recording that deepens on repeat playings.  And (surprise surprise) it turns out that Madonna had a lot more on her mind than sex and sexuality.  If there is a true &quot;concept&quot; behind the album, I'd say it's intimacy and passion.<br />The title track opens &quot;Erotica&quot; with a note of brittle, bassy sleaze; her detached voice-over sets the mood for the music to come.  Like earlier songs that relied on recitation (&quot;Justify My Love,&quot; &quot;Rescue Me&quot;), &quot;Erotica&quot; takes a few plays to really 'sink in' with listeners.  Spoken encouragements and outright commands woo the listener with hidden pleasures, an apt (if obvious) way to create a sense of immediacy and intensity.  And before the last whisper of &quot;Erotica&quot; is forgotten, the album plunges into the Peggy Lee classic, &quot;Fever,&quot; a synthesized torch song layered over a spare rhythm track.  &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot; maintains the tempo and adds an air of jaunty insouciance, a reminder that in &quot;Erotica&quot; it's Madonna who is in control.  &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot; is one of Mo-Mo's most compelling dancefloor dramas, an irresistable combination of rhythmic punch and yearning vocals.<br />&quot;Where Life Begins&quot; slows the tempo, as if to bring the dancers back to the boudoir.  The frank language of this track (an ode to oral sex) maintains a sense of good humor, and to dismiss this track as &quot;too graphic&quot; or &quot;raunchy&quot; is pure brunette chauvinism.  &quot;Bad Girl&quot; is seemingly auto-biographical, and adds an odd note of self-recrimination to the album.  &quot;Waiting&quot; is a gem; a negectful lover gets his comeuppance and is dismissed before he can offer a single excuse, all set over a jazzy bit of bump and grind music.<br />Next, Madonna takes aim at a would-be rival, and sends her packing in &quot;Thief Of Hearts.&quot;  The edgy minor key of this song segues nicely into &quot;Words,&quot; another passionate rebuke to a lover who is more of a player.  Before the mood of &quot;Erotica&quot; sours on intimacy, &quot;Rain&quot; offers a soulful view of love and affection, &quot;washing away sorrow&quot; and &quot;taking away pain&quot;.<br />For me, the next two tracks are the weakest on the album.  &quot;Why's It So Hard&quot; sounds good-intentioned, but a bit whiney as well.  &quot;In This Life&quot; brings the album to a somber anti-climax, and it's thoughtful lyric has the (un?) intentional feel of moralizing after so much hedonistic wordplay.  It's another good-intentioned effort that sounds out of place on &quot;Erotica.&quot;<br />&quot;Did You Do It&quot; recycles the backing track from &quot;Waiting,&quot; substituting boastful raps for Madonna's lyrical rebuke.  It's a logical counterpoint to &quot;Waiting,&quot; if a bit predictable.  The closing track, &quot;Secret Garden,&quot; has a jazzy underbelly, and features a Beat-inspired recitation from Madonna.  Part stream-of-conciousness, part invocation, it comes as a wistful nod to passion spent and a reminder that intimacy is heightened by imagination.<br />&quot;Erotica&quot; isn't a flawless recording, the most obvious detriment being the vocal mix.  Madonna occasionally sounds detached from the music, a tinny presence set between a rolling bassline and thudding beats.  But apart from this (and a handful of lyrical pretense), &quot;Erotica&quot; is an impressive collection of songs that show alternate sides to intimacy without sounding preachy or hypocritical.  Whether or not you find the album &quot;sexy&quot; is a matter of personal taste.  &quot;Erotica&quot; is Madonna's vision, and you don't have to be a voyeur to get off on what she sees.<br />-Stoned Soulisn't a flawless recording, the most obvious detriment being the vocal mix.

B000002LRX|5.0|This is real good. Buy it now.
B00000J7S8|1.0|Though I don't normally care for most jazz music, I thought I would try this one because it was highly recommended in a favorite classical Christian education (!) catalog.  I'll have to say that I was underwhelmed.  I agree with a previous reviewer who said Ms. Krall sounds like a typical lounge singer in one of those big hotels, where the attendees converse, politely clap at the end of a song, and then converse again.  I'm sorry, I really tried to like it.  Is she popular because she's kind of pretty?
B00004YW6I|5.0|i just purchased this cd the other day and i can honestly say that it is one of the best i have heard thus far this year. i wasn't a fan of pj's until a few years ago, but upon purchasing some of her work, i am now hooked and await each release she creates. &quot;stories&quot; is a haunting work, inspired by harvey's surroundings of new york city during its creation. these are songs that are mysterious, dark, cinematic, and even romantic in scope; she has managed to find both the ugly and beautiful aspects of concrete jungles perfectly. among some of the better songs on this album are &quot;big exit&quot; (a truly frightening look at  fear of an unstable world), &quot;we float&quot; (mesmerizing), &quot;horses in my dreams&quot;, &quot;you said something&quot;, &quot;this mess we're in&quot; (featuring a terrific duo of pj and thom yorke of radiohead)...these are only a few fine examples of harvey's wonderful songwriting/voice, but the album is a strong, colorful work as a whole. she is an artist to be admired and watched, as her craft only gets better with each work. after an impressive collection of songs as this, i am eager to see what she delivers next. it will undoubtedly be well worth the wait.
0451163532|5.0|Just finished reading &quot;On Wings of Eagles&quot; by Ken Follet. It's a non-fiction about how Ross Perot (using his top execs. and Green Beret Col. Bull Simon (ret.)) breaks his (innocent) people out of a Tehran, Iran prison and Iran, overland during the February 9th, 1979  revolution, when Ayatollah Khomeini had led the overthrow of the pro-West shah.  Very exciting. They were, as Col. Bull Simons states, witnessing history in the making. They were right in the center of a very violent revolution. I mean right there in the streets while it was going on. WHEW!<br />This also Shows you what a lotta money can and can't do<br />My only rant is why there wasn't a picture of Rashid! Rashid is the real hero. He  picked up a gun and incited the revolutionaries to storm the prison and break  everyone out. Then he took the Americans overland thru hostile bandit and Kurdish  tribal territory at the foot of the freezing Elburz Mts. to the Turkey border town of  Sero. Securing their safe escape. If it wasn't for Rashid,  Bill and Paul would still be in prison and the rest still  waiting at the Hyatt Hotel<br />I mean there are pictures of Ross Perots mother and son for christ sake, who weren't  even involved in this,  yet there are  no pictures (except one of his backside) of the  man who saved them all. Rashid. That's inexcusable.<br />Ross Perot makes a statement in the book  I feel everyone should learn and teach their kids.<br />&quot;But if you go through life worrying about all the bad things that   can happen, you soon convince yourself that  it's best to do nothing at all&quot;<br />I believe that should be chiseled on plaques and mounted  in every school yard and class room across the nation.<br />Again, this shows you what a lotta money can and can't do. Great read!
0792842499|5.0|It's ironic that the best film about the American West was directed and produced by foreigners from Spain and Italy.  Of course, the 3 main stars are Americans, but the rest of the cast are Europeans.  This movie has everything: exciting action, brutal violence, some sadness, and a wicked sense of humor.  Eli Wallach as the bandit &quot;Tuco&quot; easily steals the show; his performance is truly memorable.  Clint Eastwood is perfect as the quiet, clever yet ruthless bounty hunter who teams with and occasionally torments Tuco, and Lee Van Cleef is absolutely evil as &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;.
B0000026WD|4.0|Michael Jackson has made some great music in the past, and this fantastic album from 1991 is no exception, but is this going to be the '90s version of 'THRILLER'?<br />Well...no, not by a long shot, but that does not mean to say that 'DANGEROUS' is a 'BAD' (as it were) album, which also says alot about 'THRILLER'.<br />Most of the tracks on here are fantastic! 'Black Or White' was nominated as the No.1 single of 1991, 'In The Closet' featured Naomi Cambell (though Jackson did ask Madonna, but she politely declined), 'Give In To Me' featured rock band 'Slash' to do the guitar riffs, and 'Dangerous' is a cool, layed-back song about a 'Dangerous' girl standing a guy up or something.<br />Some days, you'll feel that this is the greatest album in the world, and at other times, you'll wonder why you bought this album in the first place.<br />This album may not be up to the standards of 'THRILLER', but never the less, Michael Jackson enters the '90s in fantastic form!
B00003CXE7|4.0|I prefer my flicks to be a bit more subdued. I could have lived without all the floaty nonsense at the end. I knew what was happening. No need to 2x4 me over the head.<br />On the good side, the cinemaphotography is breathtaking. Really lovely shots that I kept imagining framed and on my wall. Acting is well done and Gravitas (Oliver Reed) was splendid. He will be much missed.<br />I was told that this was a very gorey film. I did not come away with that impression at all. I would watch it again.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Robin Trower, both the man and the band, are two of the most underrated things in rock. Perhaps you have not even heard of him, and yet, if you are a fan of the blues-infected hard rock that was popular at the time of this record's release, or even simply a fan of great guitar playing, then this album belongs in your collection. There are several titanic tracks on this album, although every one of them is a winner. Day of the Eagle is a riveting hard rocker and a perfect album opener. The next song, the title track, is one of those rare songs that no matter how many times I hear it, I still love it. Other winners include In This Place and Little Bit of Sympathy. Too Rolling Stoned has a terrific guitar solo that is rarely ever mentioned as being one of the best. James Dewar is a good singer as well, and perfect for this type of music, not to mention being a great bass player. Reg Isidore on drums is more than competent. <br />As for the live bonus tracks, well, they are a nice addition but ultimately not essential. Why? Well, they are basically the songs from the album played live with little improvisitation, as you would expect from a concert for a radio show. Completely unlike Trower's 10-15+ minute improv jams that you can find on his real live albums. Not bad stuff, but I'd rather just hear the studio versions. The only jam here that exceeds the one on the actual album is Little Bit of Sympathy, as it has a somewhat extended guitar solo from Trower. Still, the album is well worth buying for what was there in the first place.
0767819594|5.0|Well I think that this movie was a really good one, it is about a player (Ryan Phillippe), who makes a bet with his step sister about sleeping with this virgian girl who is staying in his aunts house, it has a rather unique ending, but it is a great movie, and kinda twisted.  If you haven't seen it you should rent it or buy it, then make your chioce.
B000002TQB|5.0|This is my favourite Blur album, hands down. 'Boys And Girls' is the song that introduced me to this band. Sitting in front of the TV early one morning in 1994, the video for the song came on. It was so incredibly cheap, corny and wonderful all at the same time. I was a fan straight away!<br />This album is PERFECT. Everything from the CD cover to the songs themselves. Not one bad song, even the silly instrumental noodling of 'Lot 105' has it's charm. The band has drawn comparisions to 60's Britpoppers The Kinks mainly for their quirky character studies in catchy three minute pop songs. Lead singer Damon Albarn doesn't have a great voice but oddly enough that is part of the appeal of these songs, which are times poignant and at other brash and punkish. <br />Am I going a bit overboard with the praise? Maybe. But you must understand, if you don't have this album, I'm trying to get you to BUY IT. Dustmen, the dog track, bank holidays and estate housing - if it's British, it's most likely on here. Even the BBC shipping forecast is romanticised in the album's opus 'This Is A Low', a swirling, psychedelic ballad that will have you shaking your head in awe of it's splendour. What's that saying about the British being the only people who really understand irony? Blur do nothing to disprove this.<br />Five stars. Hell, give them five and a half..
B00004ZD69|5.0|Albums like these are hard to come by these days.  Putting it simply, this second full-length release by Canada's godspeed you black emperor! is meant to be heard from start to finish.  Inspiring, beautiful, breathtaking, and explosive! yeah! these nine-piece band know how to rock!
B0000024TQ|5.0|The critic is right-this is the best Simon and Garfunkel album-it edges out Bridge Over Trouble Water as being more consistent. Side One is fantastic and flows like a conversation about America in the late 60's. &quot;America&quot; is arguably their best song, but side one with its journey from childhood through adulthood is almost like a mini concept album.  I believe I once read that is what S &amp; G were attempting on side one.  Actually, I tire a bit of &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, good song that it is, because of the sing-song melody.  &quot;At The Zoo&quot; is good satire, and &quot;Fakin It&quot; rings true to me.  You can really sense the togetherness of the duo in this album, I think, more than &quot;Bridge.&quot;  It really does a great job of capturing a lot of the questioning attitudes of late 60's middle class white America without ever getting too political, and thus is maybe a bit more timeless than albums that were overtly so.  The melodies shine, the arrangements are thought out well without being too self-conscious, and there is a feeling of purpose that exceeds any other Simon and Garfunkel album.  Darn great stuff.
B0000541AM|5.0|This is a must see for anybody who relishes good old fashioned violence. Knifes, sticks, bottles, and fist instead of today's cowardly and wimpy like violence using uzi's, ak-47's, and drive-by's. This movie is pure testosterone man. It's one of my all time favorites and I can't wait to get it on DVD because the soundtrack is awesome too. There aren't many movies like this, that remain etched on the brain- but of course I saw it 50 times hehe.
6304618344|5.0|This is the most novel premise for an action movie I've ever seen. Admittedly it may lack something in plausibilty, and a lot of people have vocally complained about this, but I don't really see the problem. This is a great movie, full of inspired acting, brilliant scripting and, more importantly, action. Lots and lots of action. The amount and quality of action only Hong Kong director John Woo could manage. The magnificently choreographed gunfights and artistic use of slow motion make for some of the greatest scenes I've ever seen. Probably the only weak link in the movie is that Nicholas Cage is a much more compelling villain than John Travolta, so it kind of stings to have Castor Troy build up so much momentum that then gets lost once he starts wearing Sean Archer's face. Still, don't be fooled by all the philistines out there. See this movie, you won't regret it.

044022425X|3.0|I honestly didn't enjoy this one as much as the previous three. This book takes place in the colonies, but Jamie and Clare really belong in Scotland.  I am eagerly looking forward to the next book and hopeful they will get back where they belong.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|'The Striaght Story' is just that. The story of a man and his tractor, no hidden agendas. Just a sick brother and the open mid west highways. Alvin Straight goes along his trip with the attitude and doesn't seem to to back down for even the slightest moment. Along the way his simple words change peoples lives in ways most wonderful. This film is simple thats an overall fact at times you even feel bored with interest but the end result is well worth it, this is one of those rare movies that makes you proud you belong to the human race.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is the highlight of Radiohead's career. No matter what they do, this is the album that they'll forever be known for, and for good readon. OKC is simply put, one of the best albums ever made, second only to Radiohead's own Kid A, which followed on the trails of OKC. <br />The heart-pumping bass on Airbag, the angelic chorus in Paranoid Android, the spacey guitars in SHA, the climatic bass and vocals on Exit Music, the 3 Thom's on Let Down, the poppy piano on Karma Police, the all-too-perfect negative utopic Fitter Happier, the harsh guitars of Electioneering, the paranoic sounds of CUTW, the relaxing sounds of No Surprises, the beautiful words of Lucky, all the way to the last ring in The Tourist, OKC is perfect from end to end. The way the music, the messages, the emotions flow from song to song is worthy of its own book. <br />Radiohead's OKC was the best album of the 20th century, and with Kid A they don't appear to be loosing their momentum at all.
B000005H4K|5.0|I do not think it's very difficult to argue that this is probably the greatest piano trio recording of in jazz history by three of the greatest players in history. If you enjoy traditional Ellington material, you'll find this quite different, but it reveals yet another brilliant side of his musical genius. His piano work on this album further supports the unique approach he took to this instrument. The versions of &quot;African Flower&quot; and &quot;Solitude&quot; are exteremely powerful. If you like Ellington, Roach, or Mingus this is must-have album.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Before he was Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke, David Bowie was &quot;Bowie: the singer-songwriter&quot; and &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; is Bowie at the height of this particular phase in his career. The album is quite diverse in terms of both musical and lyrical content. One song can be a bouncy piano-driven pop song, while the next could be a sombre reflective guitar piece. All the songs are excellent, unlike these one-hit wonder albums that just seem to be cropping up nowadays.<br />The album kicks off with &quot;Changes&quot; - a fantastic piano ballad in which Bowie urges &quot;you Rock 'n' rollers&quot; to turn and face the strange changes that one has to go through in life. &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot; is another piano-based song, and quite an upbeat and poppy one despite its dark lyrical content - reflecting Bowie's early obsession with the philosophy of Nietzsche (&quot;Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use.....You gotta make way for the Homo Superior&quot;). &quot;Eight Line Poem&quot; is pure poetic beauty, and could happily be read as a poem on its own. &quot;Life On Mars&quot; is, in many people's belief, Bowie's best song. While I don't think it's his very best, it's still a great track, with a sweeping string arrangement courtesy of Mick Ronson (who also plays guitar on the album). &quot;Kooks&quot; is an irresistible acoustic-pop song that Bowie wrote for his (then) baby son Zowie, and it features some memorable lines, in particular &quot;Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads/ 'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads&quot;. &quot;Quicksand&quot; is a break from the wit and wackiness of the previous few songs. Bowie picks up his acoustic guitar and goes into reflective mode, telling us that he's &quot;sinking in the quicksand of [his] thoughts&quot;. As well as thought-provoking lyrics, the song boasts a lovely melody, making it one offavourite songs on the album. Things get happy again with &quot;Fill Your Heart&quot;, a jazzy music-hall number with saxophone by Bowie himself and trumpet by Trevor Bolder (who also plays bass on the album). &quot;Andy Warhol&quot; is a dark, Spanish-sounding folk song about, you guessed it - Andy Warhol. The lyrics are truly bizarre, but it's a great song nevertheless.&quot;Song For Bob Dylan&quot; is another song about an important cult figure of the 60's/70's. It's also quite a good folk-rock tune. &quot;Queen Bitch&quot;, the album's lone hard-rocker is another winner, with some particularly funny (and biting) lyrics. Musically, this is one of the songs that paved the way for Bowie's next album. The album's sombre closer, the &quot;The Bewlay Brothers&quot;, is a musically sparse and eerily moving track, with some rather dark lyrics concerning mental illness, bisexuality and drug abuse. It's another good piece of poetry - the imagery is just striking. Its sinister &quot;Lay me place and bake me Pie&quot; coda sung in both low and high-pitched cockney voices is strangely almost tear-jerking.<br />Well, there you have it folks. The mature, intelligent lyrics and catchy tunes are bound to get any serious lover of good music hooked. These are the my exact qualities that make &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; one of my favourite albums and truly one of Bowie's best.
068485015X|5.0|This is a book that could change your life, like it did for me.  I have read a lot of books on philosophies of life, psychology and stuff of that kind.  All the books give ways to a &quot;successful life&quot; or even &quot;happy life&quot; and sorts.. but unfortunately, in practical life, most of them are very difficult or even impossible to follow.  This book is different.  It will NOT advise you.  It will talk about life in a way that YOU will be able to analyse your own life and know what's wrong with you.  And then YOU will be able to solve your own problems.<br />That's like a very very good psychotherapist. <br />The author doesn't insist that his thoughts are right.  He doesn't make any apriori assumptions about the thoughts of readers.  He talks a lot about God, and yet in a way that would suit fine even to blatant atheists.<br />Similarly, the portions on love and discipline are just fantastic.  You can't deny them as being facts even if your thoughts are different. <br />Rather than teaching you new things, this book will lead you to self-discovery.<br />I definitely recommend it to everyone who can and likes to think.
B00000JPHG|3.0|Okay, Okay, so Bride of Chucky is a load of crap. But I still found it somewhat enjoyable.<br />The worst thing about this film was the constant references to the 80's and 80's horror films.<br />Anyway.. this film still had some good stuff.. even though I can't remember what it is.

6303481272|5.0|boy if you are a fan of anime then see this movie from Manga Video.  the action is intense and the story will pull you in.  this is by far the best anime i've seen in years.  there's no other anime that can beat this movie.  go rent it and see it for yourself.  it will be a wonderful experience.(caution: although animated this is not for anyone under 17.  there is a lot of gore, language, and nudity
B00003CX8I|4.0|This is a great movie...however if you are looking to buy this for a comic fanitic be carefull.  First off, all die hard comic fans have already seen this movie. The main problem lies in the characters.  If you are expecting the  marvel x-men with this is not the film for you.  The die hard fans that I watched this movie with found many areas where the characters did not jive with the established lititure, but, none of them had any complaints about the rest of the movie.  The only reason this did not get five-stars from me is because of the inaccuracy of the characters.  On the other hand I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie.  The DVD version is worth the extra couple of bucks simply because of the extra clips.               DEFFINATLY ON PAR WITH MI2 AND GONE IN 60 SEC.
B000002LBH|5.0|I read this book in which the song &quot;Asleep&quot; is a focus. I bought this cd to listen to Asleep, and I must say, that at first I just listened to Asleep, because it was too long to sit through to hear all of it. But I just left it in my cd player, and kept playing it. The more I listened, the more I loved it. Its just great, kind of odd sounding songs. It is an acquired taste, but you'll like it, but if you aren't gonna give it time to get under your skin, you'll not like it. For fans of bands like Radiohead, R.E.M., Oasis, and Blur. Some good &quot;sonic experimentation&quot;, some songs that somebody who likes good musicality will enjoy, nothing that will sound like you would hear on the radio, some songs even stick in your head. Very excellent, way long, longest cd I own! 24 frikin' tracks, didn't think that many songs fit on a cd!
B00004SW9R|5.0|Been collecting albums from this era for about 20 years and don't know how I missed this, until summer 2000 that is.<br />Love it. The vodoo- psychadelica-blues mix is spooky but magnetic. It also dates well, because not many people were using psychadela in this way, so it comes across as strikingly fresh. Frankly, there's not much else I've found that sounds quite like this, and beleive me, I am a hard-core record collector that seeks out underground stuff.<br />I could to an anaylsis of how the album works, but don't want to kill the vibe for you.<br />So, find out for yourself: This is a really great album to play very late at night. It creates such a stange atmosphere, as if Dr John were doing the voodoo rituals right in your living room. Stoned-out, night shift FM DJs in 1968 must have had a ROYAL BLAST with Gris-Gris.<br />Don't buy it if you're looking for anything generic.
B00003CXE7|5.0|the title of this movie most likely conjures up images of bloody 1 on 1 battles in the middle of the great coloseum, and if that's what you want to see, you will. the true plot of the story, however, is more akin to ben-hur, where the loyalty of a man is unjustly set aside for the pursuit of power, followed by the inevitable vengance that brings the movie to a satisfying end. I shall probably count this movie among those I watch on a regular basis, the action sequences intermixed with the plot developement  are very nicely done, you always find a little more in each scene that you probably missed the first time. this is truly a modern day epic------finally!
B00004YKUX|1.0|I'm a Johnny Cash fan, don't get me wrong. I've seen him in concert , I own a good many of his works. I bought this CD after seeing some stellar reviews of it in the local papers. Unfortunately, I found myself advancing from track to track trying to find some emotion in Johnny's vocal chords. His voice on this is rambling, bland and lackluster. He's TALKING more than singing and he's talking in a way that, if he were in front of me, I would probably be counting sheep.There's also something missing in that familiar voice that is hard to explain.
B000003TAW|5.0|A few years ago, I bought this album after seeing Weezer live. To date, it's the best CD I own! It's diverse as to style--you have hyped up and jammin' (&quot;My Name is Jonas,&quot; &quot;Surf Wax America&quot;), mellow and slow (&quot;Undone-The Sweater Song,&quot; &quot;The World Has Turned and Left Me Here&quot;), just plain fun (&quot;Buddy Holly,&quot;), angst (&quot;Say It Ain't So&quot;), and sadness (&quot;Only in Dreams&quot;). My personal favorites are &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot; and &quot;Only in Dreams,&quot; but only the first four minutes of the latter. (&quot;Only in Dreams&quot; is 8 minutes and turns to instrumental after 4; I like it but it gets repetitive.) If you want to have a CD that can keep you flying when you're happy, get this. If you want a CD that can help you when you're angry or sad or emotional, get this. The guitars are fun, at times punk-like, and Rivers Cuomo's voice could put feeling into a State of the Union address. A must have for fans of quirky, AWESOME music.
B00004XMVL|1.0|If you liked &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, you'll love this movie. Vin Diesel makes Arnold Schwanzegger look like a Shakespearan actor. Except for the blonde, I couldn't understand what most of these actors were saying. This movie never should have left Australia.
B0000027RL|5.0|I first learned of the legendary Pearl Jam after buying Nirvana's landmark album, Nevermind. Although, in my opinion, Pearl Jam is not as good as Nirvana, and never will be -- they are a definite runner up. My friend was playing Nevermind for me when his mom popped in Ten and went to Track 3. I thought it was an excellent song but at about the end of the first minute when Vedder roars into the chorus again, I was awed. An incredible album that you should buy. Not only is &quot;Alive&quot; excellent, but just about every track on Ten is. It's very rare you find an album without one weak point. It's more than your money's worth.
B00000JWV4|5.0|The quintessential baseball movie... Anyone longing for the days when it was still &quot;A game&quot; will love this one. Costner goes above and beyond in his role as a baseball fan. This is a must for baseball purists, and for anyone that has ever tossed a ball with his Dad in the backyard. James Earl Jones' &quot;They will come&quot; speech is a classic. I can't say enough about this movie... A MUST SEE!
B00003CXE7|1.0|I haven't seen this movie yet because I wanted buy it and watch it. Am I the only person out there that doen't like the WIDESCREEN format? You can get the standard format on VHS and on some DVD's. If you check all the new releases, they only come in Widescreen. Why is that?
0060207051|5.0|i have yet to meet a child who does not love this book. it is a pleasure to read aloud with children again, again, and again. but pray that they don't notice the painting hanging above the little bunny's bed! it is a scene of terror from &quot;the runaway bunny,&quot; in which a young bunny is swimming in a river and an older bunny, in thigh-high rubber boots, is about to catch him with a carrot on a hook tied to a fishing pole. if your baby ran away would you stick his pacifier on a hook and try to reel him in that way? think about it, it is pretty disturbing.  fortunately, most young children do not consciously notice this detail. but if your child starts having nightmares about being impaled on a fishing hook, look to your library and this much-loved classic for the possible reason why.

6305014140|5.0|I never seen any anime more entertaining than this one.  I don't even want to spoil the movie for you.  Just run out and get it.  Final Criticism: Story line- one of the best/ animation- one of the best/ Overall - one of the all-time greatest
B000001FDQ|2.0|Yngwie is arguably the fastest guitarist in the metal world, but the real question remains: \\"is faster necessarily better?\\" I don't think so, as many other factors are more important to the musical equation (melody, harmony, rhythm, substance...) The key absence here is \\"feeling\\". Besides, the man cannot compose decent music.<br />Originally of Ron Keel's band Steeler, Yngwie was introduced to the metal world heralded as \\"the fastest\\", and he was on a mission to become known for just that (which he accomplished fast!... err quickly). His post- Steeler work: Alcatrazz and solo career only confirm that he is merely a lightning fast player. That alone is not a bad thing, the real problem is that his compositions are lame and are built around emotionless shredding solos. Certainly, Yngwie has a flashing technique and is a master of his instrument, but his creativity and overall songs are not at the same level of his virtuosity. Contrary to thousands of other \\"slower\\" guitarists, Yngwie's music rarely evokes deep emotions. Rising Force is one of his best albums, though. This CD features outstanding drummer Barriemore Barlowe (ex-Jethro Tull). Unfortunately, his drums sound hollow due to the disc's overall weak production (you cannot notice or feel the bass guitar). Rising Force is perhaps Yngwie's best work from his early solo career, but I believe his work with Steeler was far more better, maybe because he really played in a true band. <br />Undoubtedly the Shredding Viking has certainly impressed a lot of people throughout his career and will probably continue to do so, but if FEEL and MELODY are what you're looking for then you have plenty of other better options... If \\"sheer speed\\" is the only thing that you are looking for, then allow me to recommend you other better players of the genre: Greg Howe, Ronnie LeTekro, Tony McAlpine, George Bellas, Jeff Kollman, and many others more.
6304493681|5.0|A definite must have DVD.  In no way possible would you ever get disappointed  in purchasing this anime.  By far the best japanimation ever. Final Criticism: Story Line: Excellent/ Animation: Great/ Overall: One of the greatest.
B000000OQ5|5.0|I simply do not know where to begin with this record. Many of the previous reviews echo my sentiments about this album exactly.<br />\\"Mechanical Resonance\\" is simply a must-have Hard Rock CD. This is straight-up, a**-kickin', no frills Rock And Roll. There is a lot musically for a true Rock And Roll fan to sink their teeth into. Across the board, this album has it all: riff-intensive songs, awesome solos, acoustic interludes, and a good dose of blues and melody. There are plenty of both short, to-the-point, rockers: \\"Ez Come Ez Go\\", \\"2 late 4 Love\\", \\"Love Me\\" and long kickin' jams: \\"Cumin' Atcha Live\\", \\"Cover Queen\\" and the album's tour-de-force \\"Modern Day Cowboy\\", which is their best song of all time. Not to mention that \\"Mechanical Resonance\\" is the band's best and strongest album. I love the rest of their output, but nothing touches this one. Same goes for any of the other hard rock bands of the time. <br />Tesla was not a hair band, they were a Rock And Roll band. They did not worry about their hair or sported spandex, they put the music first and it shows on this album. I usually list other standout tracks of any album I review. But I can't do it for this album, because from beginning to end, this album is a true classic !

155890641X|5.0|This movie was one I enjoyed when I was younger. The animation is extremely bright, colorful and well-done. Disney did an excellent job on the artwork, unlike the work you will find in their current films (&quot;The Emporer's New Groove&quot; or &quot;Hercules&quot;). The story is well-adapted from the original. It entertains little children with the interesting characters, such as the dwarves, and plenty of lively songs. If you have kids, this video is a must!
B00001NFCY|1.0|If there were an award for the most pretentious piece of trash on CD, Creed's Human Clay would win top honors. I bought this CD, and i couldnt even get through it one time.  I sold it on ebay.  I felt like I was being preached to on religion through a web of extremely poorly executed rock.  Their sound is indistinctive and there are better alternatives that have a cleaner sound and that dont have religious undertones such as Lifehouse or Pearl Jam.  I cant wait until Creed falls into the annals of Bad Rock.

B000002C4J|4.0|This is one of Celine's best album. Collaborating with some of the biggest and best names in the music business including: her long-time idol Barbara Streisand (for their spectacular, over-the-top duet &quot;Tell Him&quot;), the Bee Gees (on &quot;Immortality&quot;)Carole King and Sir George Martin (who co-wrote &quot;The Reason&quot;)and Lucianno Pavarotti (for their duet &quot;I Hate You Then I Love You&quot;). The album was vaulted to the top of the charts back in 1998 by the ubiquitous Titanic theme &quot;My Heart Will Go On.&quot; Other outstanding tracks include David Foster's gorgeous masterpiece &quot;To Love You More,&quot; the emotional title track, the powerful, poignant &quot;Us,&quot; beautiful &quot;Miles To Go Before I Sleep,&quot; and Celine's pseudo hip-hop song &quot;Treat Her Like A Lady,&quot; (featuring Diana King.) While there are a couple of weak tracks, and the aforementioned duet with Pavarotti suffers from mediocre songwriting, all in all, it is an excellent adult contemporary pop album.
B00003CXE7|5.0|GLADIATOR was the best movie of 2000.  If it is not nominated for at least three academy awards (best picture, best actor, best score) then something is wrong with the world.  The recreation of ancient rome is more impressive than anything else this year.  Gladiator marked a change from the disaster of 199 with the biggest dissapointment/flop of the past two years, star wars episode one.  Talk about different--good acting, character &amp; plot development, and a good use of special effects.  This is a film that deserves ten stars, let alone 5.   If you don't have a DVD player, now you have a reason to get one. DVD is the only way to see this, and the extras are second only to the director's cut DVD of Terminator 2.

630575067X|1.0|I am ashamed that this is asscoaited with the original trilogy of Star Wars films.  SWEP1 was the worst movie I had seen since &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; George Lucas shoud pull this title from the shelves and make a public apology to all the adult star wars fans for putting out this G rated nonsense.  Since when is jedi power controlled by microscopic organizms--well, I guess that is more PC than it being a eastern-like religion. I have to say, the computer animation was great, but you have to use it in moderation! The whole damn movie was cgi, as well as the most annoying character ever created, Jar Jar Binks.  I pray to god that he dies early in episode 2.  And what was with all the hype over Darth Maul? He was in the movie for all of five minutes, with just as many lines.  How is it that a retarded cgi character gets second billing where a sith lord only gets five lines.  I'm ranting, and I cant take anymore of this...

B00003CWPR|1.0|Now, granted, my review is going to be a little more harsh than usual, probably because I'm more of an action, plot type person.  Seemed like this movie stumbled along veeeeeery slowly.  By the end of the movie, I was scratching my head trying to figure out what the movie was about.  It leaves you hanging in the end with many unanswered questions, not to mention feeling, what I call, &quot;movie raped&quot;.  Defniitely not worth my money or my time.<br />I could discern no plot to the movie.  It's simply about a guy who is a little disappointed with his own marriage, and finds himself inevitably drawn to mystery, never really cheating on his wife, but not being totally honest with her either.  In my mind, a major flop of a movie.  I'm rather surprised it has received the ratings that it has.  Probably because most of the people that wish to review it liked it, while the rest of the world hated it so much, they couldn't stand to even sit here online, and type their honest review, it wasn't worth their time.  I offer my review, because I honestly feel it stunk.  I left the theatre very disappointed, and attempting to disect the movie, and find out a plot.  Certainly, there is some mystery in the movie as Cruise finds himself discovered in a secret society he entered uninvited.  But nothing is ever really explained.  A married man, furstrated with his own marriage, jumps into the middle of a secret society of people having sex with masks on, but doesn't really do anything wrong while there himself, and his wife ends up finding out, and that's about it.  A little mystery in the works, but nothing ever explained.  A complete bore, and waste of time.<br />Of course, again, I'm not into exploring the relationships and all that jazz.  Basically they're all the same...  Predictable...  Guy/Girl have relationship, one of them cheats, they get caught.  I'm looking for entertainment, which this had none of.  A little mystery, granted the naken women were great eye candy, and one annoying piano note for a music score, but that's about all I have good to say about the movie.  But don't let that confuse you as to the one piano note.  Annoying as a migrane...
B000003TA4|2.0|The only good songs on here are<br />1. Smells like teen spirit<br />2. Lithium<br />Those are probably the best on the best songs you will find from Nirvana on this CD. everybody thinks that Nirvana is so good and stuff because they started to influence bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit. Well they did a good job on that and made them sucessful, but them, they just didn't make it. Nirvana is the very first version of Limp Bizkit but they are so old and different that they just aren't my type of music. if you're a fan of Nirvana and know them pretty well, then buy this album and I garuntree, you'll like it!
B000002U8G|5.0|I know there are 43 gadzillion reviews on this one, but I am unabashedley adding one more. This is and has and always will be my favorite Floyd album. Why? Well, I believe this LP, and not Dark Side, was the height of Floyd's trek through stark experimentation during those waning day-glo colored days of nights on white lightning and exotic 'srooms. By the time Dark Side comes around, Floyd is doing much of the same stuff as in Meddle, except hints of cynicism ( which reaches its height in The Wall )begins to set in. Meddle is finely honed, starting its oddyssey several LPs back with &quot;Saucerful of Secrets&quot; and traversing through Umma and Atom ( even &quot;More&quot; and Valley influences can be heard in this LP).  Meddle is Floyd's final swansong to those happy phychedelic days when virtually everything was happening and the openess was there to allow everything to happen ( an important point!). <br />The front side of this LP is light and airy. &quot;One of These Days,&quot; &quot;A Pillow of Winds,&quot; &quot;San Tropez,&quot; even &quot;Seamus&quot;....easy listening phychedelia...with hints of the playfulness found with Barrett and on Umma. &quot;Fearless&quot; is ok, but it is a weakest track overall, going on a bit too long ( sorry Seamus knockers, I have a dog too, and she sings quite a bit...Seamus has grown on me..and it is the only song I know that features a dog as the lead singer!)<br />Then there is the flip side. I was an English major back then, and I had just got done analyzing Coleridge's &quot;Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner&quot; when I first heard &quot;Echoes.&quot; The allusions are just striking...the very music itself is a metaphor for this poem. I thought to myself if I was ever to make a film version of the Rhyme, Echoes would be my soundtrack. In Echoes, there is the experimental height of what started wayyyyyyyyyy back when Barrett and Waters dabbled with &quot;Careful With That Ax, Eugene&quot; and &quot;Astronomy Domine.&quot; This refinement in eletronic phychedelia led to, or at the very least, was the engine behind most of the electronic music that was to follow both in and out of the New Age gambit. Echoes, simply put, is a masterpiece...the Brandenburg Concerto, if you will, of an electronic musical voice born in a digital age moving into the 21st century.
0425170349|4.0|This book is good because it is something that could happen. John Clark and Ding Chavez return in this story about a multi-national counterterrorist team. Clark, whom you remember from Without Remorse and every Ryan book from The Cardinal of the Kremlin on, is the leader of the team, which is headquartered in Hereford Air Force Base in England. This book is simply excellent. The action sequences where team rainbow takes down the terrorists are great, and the story is good, and makes you wonder what will happen next. The mail problems are the lack of character development and the Australia Olympics scheme. It is cold there in our summer, that is why we had to wait several months, for it to warm up there. Nevertheless, an engrossing story.

B00000K2UX|5.0|Im suprised that you cannot get the Top Gun soundtrack music videos on VHS or DVD. <br />Like many people who love the movie and the music, I would have no hesitation in purchasing it. I havent seen the video clip for &quot;Danger Zone&quot; since 1988 when it was shown on MTV back to back with &quot;Dreams&quot; by Van Halen. In fact, I think the music videos would be a great inclusion on a special edition DVD of the Top Gun Movie.<br />If anyone knows if it is avaliable anywhere, drop me a line:<br />drynne@telstra.com   I will be eternally grateful.
B000056N8X|4.0|Didn't they say that the Final Dimension was the last one? Well, anyways, this one was good, even though it was nothing relating to the original ones. Adrian something stars as the &quot;brother&quot; of Lambert, the immortal who travels across time, and together they join forces to battle the evil Kell (Bruce something). There were some scenes that were not added from the theaterical trailer but this one was a good one, but there might be another one supposidly.
B000002U8G|5.0|Sometimes, by instinct, I call this album &quot;Echoes&quot;. That song goes through half of the album and is among Floyd's most underrated classics. It is so gentle, but so intense, and the lyrics are delightful. My fascination for &quot;Echoes&quot; doubled after I watched it in the VHS &quot;Live At Pompeii&quot. Other great track is the bombastic &quot;One OfThese Days&quot;, which has the most hypnotizing bass line I've ever heard. ESSENTIAL FLOYD!!
B000001OAA|5.0|I love this CD so much, I have to review it twice.  I've heard people say that this CD sounded a lot like the other music that was out at the time.  Well, I never understood that because when I heard this CD, it was like nothing I had ever heard before.  Every song, carefully crafted until it was just right. I was never able to relate to anyone who didn't find Garbage's work intriguing.  This is raw talent folks.

0316236535|5.0|I'm a children's librarian.  This book is so incredibly popular with my library children that I order a dozen copies at a time.  Its simple, bold graphics are extremely pleasing, and the children love the cutout pictures.<br />I frequently use this book for story programs.  The first part of the book builds the monster by adding one facial feature at a time.  I usually ask the children what the facial feature is or what color it is.  The hair is purple, the face is green. When the monster is complete, I ask if they are scared.  They never are.  Then we get out our pointer fingers, shake them at the book, and in our bossiest voice chase that monster away.  The book ends with the children telling the monster not to come back until we say so.<br />Whenever I read this book to a group, I invariably see children rereading the book on their own.  Usually half the children want to check out a copy of the book.  Because the graphics are so good, and the story so strong, even very young children can &quot;read&quot; this book to themselves.  I love to see the children sitting at tables, shaking their fingers at the book, and gruffly telling that bad monster to &quot;Go away.&quot;<br />I highly recommend this book because it is empowering, it's fun, and it's a great book to teach your child to love books.

B000002HRE|5.0|Re-Load is possible one of their best cd's out there. i don't see why old fans of Metallica would choose to hate music like this. sure, it is not like Kill 'em all and Ride The Lightning but do you expect all of their cd to sound like their first? the best songs on the cd are: The Unforgiven II, Fuel, Slither, heck, they are all great. if you do not have this cd, buy it but if you are just starting to listen to Metallica, I say start from Kill 'Em All and work up to S&amp;M.
6303686796|1.0|Apparently a film classic about a Vietnam veteran who becomes a taxi driver and then lets himself be broken down by the misery and the meaninglessness of modern society.    Seen with Year 2000 eyes, »Taxi Driver« does not have a great deal of appeal. It has purely historical value.    The best things you can say about this film is the very beautiful filming, plus that it is interesting to watch very young Robert DeNiro's and even younger Jodie Foster's already then great talents. You also get glimpses of Harvey Keitel.    Do watch »Taxi Driver«, 'cause it is one of those classics that you have to have seen. But don't expect too much.
6303109950|1.0|This must be a cult movie because of all the glowing reviews.  Let me speak for the rest of humanity and point out that this is a terribly made picture.  Every phrase uttered by Val Kilmer ia a calculated, forced bit of cutesiness that Kilmer, himself, can't help but smirk as he says them.  It is totally silly. \\"Im You're Huckleberry\\", \\"Are we cross?\\", \\"I have not yet begun to defile myself\\".  He's obviously going for laughs here.  Doc Holliday, in real life was a haggard, southern gentlemen who was a bitter, ruthless killer.  Kilmer displays none of these traits, he was having too much fun playing the role.  For a much better portrayal of Doc Holliday, see Dennis Quaid in the superior (but somewhat flawed) Wyatt Earp.    Kurt Russell fares somewhat better as Wyatt Earp.  He wasn't miscast like Kilmer.  He actually looks the part but, as in Kilmer's case, was given a poor script to work with and was given bad direction.  There are several lines where he uses the wrong tone or emphasis.  His long-time friend, Doc Holliday is dying in a sanitorium.  So after being all choked up about it, he stands up, suddenly smiles, and glibly says \\"Thanks for always being there, Doc.\\"    I guess they ran out of poorly scripted dialogue at the end of this travesty because most of it is a montage of action footage that is mostly pointless.  Russell's Wyatt Earp shows no drive for revenge after his brother Morgan was killed.  Yet we are supposed to believe he became vengeful when the film shows Earp killing seemingly every bad guy in the west.
0312243022|2.0|Michael Cunningham, The Hours (FSG, 1998)<br /><br />The Pulitzer? Cunningham was ignored for Flesh and Blood, and got the Pulitzer for this? There's only one explanation, and that's that the Pulitzer committe (which, it was recently pointed out, is made up of journalists) completely forgot the opening hundred seventy-five pages in the process of being stunned by the last fifty.<br /><br />Publisher's Weekly, in its review of The Hours, castigates Cunningham in a minor way for the scope of Flesh and Blood, and compares The Hours favoriably to that novel because The Hours is a little less than half as long. I can't argue with PW's assertion that The Hours shows that Cunningham can write a shorter novel that has the same power as Flesh and Blood did, but I can, and do, take issue with the inference that Flesh and Blood is a lesser book because of it. Where Flesh and Blood stayed in one general time frame and focused on one excellently-drawn extended family, The Hours cuts back and forth, paralleling the lives of Virginia Woolf in England, a fan of Virginia Woolf's who's in the process of reading Mrs. Dalloway, and the fan's son, who grows up to be an award-winning poet suffering from complications resulting from AIDS.<br /><br />When Cunningham focuses on his fictional creations, things are all well and good. The Hours contains many of the things that made Flesh and Blood a great novel-- Cunningham's powerful style of narrative, his willingness to go more deeply into the emotions of characters than most writers, an ability to pace his book that's unmatched in modern literature. Ironically, it's when Cunningham focuses on Virginia Woolf and her family that the characters stop being realistic. There's just not enough of them, and Cunningham's hero-worship of Woolf is too obvious. The end result is a novel inconsistent at best.<br /><br />When it's on its game, though, The Hours is a rollercoaster of a novel. The last fifty pages, especially, will be read at one clip, as Cunningham ties in the stories of the mother and son, and the grandiose prose used in the last few sections of the novel is more than deserved. This is a novel capable of bringing tears in its last pages. If the rest of the book had been firing on that many cylinders, it would have been a Pulitzer no-brainer, but as it stands, in the bulky shadow of its superior predecessor, one wonders if the committee weren't trying to right the mistake it had made in ignoring<br />Flesh and Blood three years previous. ** 1/2Cunningham ties in the stories of the mother and son, and the grandiose prose used in the last few sections of the novel is more than deserved.

B00001NFCY|4.0|One thing that bothers me about Creed is the fact that they won't stand stronger for the Lord.  They claim that they don't have an objective to reach lost people for God and they should if they are so blessed to be saved christians as they claim.  I have a desire to reach unsaved people and tell them of Jesus' love for them and maybe one day they will stand up for what is right and have the same desire.  Great album though and some very touching lyrics.  More of the same in regards to the first Creed album musically.  God bless you all and remember Jesus does save and he is the only way to the eternal father in Heaven.  Get to know him and you'll see what life can be like when you can say that your best friend was born in a manger.
0671775308|3.0|This book is surely an interesting one, but too many repetitions and redundant information. It looks like authors were paid by the number of words rather than by the content. Somewhere in the moddle of the book you want to scream: &quot;Hey, i am not stupid. I got the point, stop repeating yourself !&quot; All ideas that are there are concentrated in the first 30 pages. Don't bother reading the rest.
B00003CXDF|5.0|This is one of the very few sequels I have seen that I thought was better then the original.  I loved it!  It was nonstop action from beginning to end.<br />I am not a big Tom Cruise fan but he did a great job in this film; his best movie since &quot;All the Right Moves,&quot; in my opinion.
B00003GPHK|5.0|This is an excellent film dealing with the classic Star Trek themes of religion, government, and the human and alien mind. This is of course territory which desperately needs attention, and of the Star Trek films this may be the one that does so best. <br />The Final Frontier gives us a different perspective on the Federation, particularly with the nicely drawn dystopic city on Nimbus III; the Neutral Zone, in my opinion, has always been one of the most interesting and multifaceted aspects of the Star Trek universe, and it's nice to get such an extensive view of this part of it. In a way, all of the Star Trek films are dealing with narrative, and particularly the forces which influence history. Here we have a beautifully done opposition of several established governments; a radical faction with a suite of complex driving forces, and catalyzed by a charismatic prophet; the Enterprise's crew, which is a breed unto itself; and, last but not least, God himself (there are nice echoes with the wonderful episode &quot;Who Mourns for Adonais?&quot;).<br />But not only are the big elements put across wonderfully. The character interaction in this movie is truly superb. Every one of the big seven has a moment; Chekhov and Sulu get their much-deserved time in the spotlight; although we never get enough time with Uhura, she does have an excellent role in this movie; Scotty has beautiful continuity with his character in the episodes. This movie also has the most extensive footage of the Kirk-Spock-McCoy triangle, not least of which is the campfire scene. The versatility of this trio and their cameraderie is of course one of the very best things about the Original Series; they can make us laugh and cry and think, all in the space of five minutes.<br />And speaking of fine acting, permit me a rhapsody on guest actor Lawrence Luckinbill. He is Star Trek's most complex villain; in fact he brings the part off so well that Sybok doesn't come across so much as a villain as a unique andpowerful figure. I won't spoil the story, but I would like to say that he prompts a fascinating revision of Spock's character. Sybok's charisma is palpable; in a sense, he is the bridge between the unique humans in the movie, and the generalized theme of prophecy, shamanism, mythology, religion, &amp;c. (take your pick of related themes).<br />Because of its humor and seriousness and several breathtaking scenes, this movie can be watched countless times, always pointing out and helping to answer new questions. Here is thoughtful science fiction which is a joy to watch.<br />I think William Shatner did just fine.
0811826848|5.0|I had to own this, but as a starving law student with no time for recreational reading I was planning to wait until the summer.  My mother sent it to me as a gift knowing what a Beatle fan I am and I must say, it is a treasure.  Just owning it is a pleasure, the book feels like a an item of fine craftsmanship, like a custom chair, a fine watch or my old Thorens turntable, it is simply exquisite.  The pages are thick and heavy and the printing quality is such that it is a pleasure to behold.<br />That the contect is equal to the presentation is what makes this such a treasure.  I've read most Beatles books, but this was the first one that felt more like sitting down and talking with them rather than being given a history lecture (well, the second, I have a little British book full of quotes that does rather well).<br />Lastly there is the photography, including many photos I had never seen before.  All reproduced large enough and of sufficient quality to be really enjoyed.<br />Well worth the money.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Who thinks up all the ways to re-do the same songs and sell millions of copies? That must be one sharp cat! Hey, I am a huge fan of the fab four, but man, what is up? I love all of these songs and they are for sure the most commercial songs the group released, but give me a fresh digitally remastered copy of &quot;I am the walrus&quot; or &quot;A day in the life&quot; or &quot;Revolution number 9&quot; or &quot;Tommorow never knows&quot; or anything on Revolver or Rubber Soul or The White Album or Pepper or Abbey Road or... I think you get the picture. I will most likely buy this album if I find out that all the songs were remastered again. I have the gold White Album which sounds great. I also bought the last release of Yellow submarine and found it to be far superior in sound quality to the gold White Album which just a few years ago was supposed to be the best you could get in remastering. That being said, I would love to hear these songs sounding even better than last years Yellow Submarine release. That alone is worth the price. I just hope George Martin is getting some of this money. Hell I hope the Beatles are getting some of this money. I think Michael Jackson owns their catalog now!!!
B00005176F|4.0|Look, its a great cd, dont get me wrong. Its full of classics and sing alongs and shows that Blur have been one of the great bands of the 90s in England, but england only. It lacks something, something hard and more edgy, something an album like Supergrass or Oasis could produce. But, if you like Blur, or the Whoo Hoo boys as known in America, this is a fine collaberation of the last 10 years of music. Certainly something better than any american pop band could produce today.
6302878527|5.0|This film is absolutely wonderful!  Although a bit on the depressing side, as the characters are cought in a marital rut. It also displays a lot of humor in the witty comments exchanged between the main characters, played by Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney.  Unfortunately, it tells a lot of truth about marriage.  &quot;What kind of people just sit there and don't say a word to eachother&quot;, Finney's character asks.  &quot;Married people&quot; Audrey answers.

These's are very great horror flicks with the foolish horror character Freddy Kruger. If I was you, I wouldn't buy these's films on DVD why? Cause it's all widescreen. But like I said, buy all 7 foolish horror flicks on video instead of DVD.
0316286443|3.0|Ever since I first saw Kevyn Aucoin on TV, it's been my dream to have him make me over.  He is a makeup genious, the most wonderful! I love the make overs and the great makeup tips. However, I was a little offended by some of his political comments.  If he wants to write about politics, he should write about them in a politically based book, not a book that is supposed to be about makeup.  I think he'd sell more books if he wasn't so offensive.
B0000508U6|5.0|i have a considerable aversion to awarding five stars to anything, because i would lose substantial credibility if i gave everything five stars, and more importantly, most records aren't good enough to merit that kind of recognition.  coldplay's first big-time, full-length release, &quot;parachutes&quot;, is essentially a flawless album.  that's heavy praise, for sure, but i'll challenge anyone to prove me wrong.  this is an album about the pains and pleasures of loving and living.  sure, almost everyone touches on these matters at some point, but rarely is it done this well.  throughout &quot;parachutes&quot; there is a strong feeling of inner sadness and failure to find true love or peace of mind, but there is always an underlying motif of hope, highlighted most poignantly by the last track, &quot;everything's not lost&quot;, and the &quot;hidden&quot; track, &quot;life is for living&quot;.  the song that may stand out the most is &quot;yellow&quot;, because its melody is the most immediately accessible, but after spinning this disc a few times, every song will please equally.  consequently, the album has a strong, cohesive quality to it, much like travis' latest offering, &quot;the man who&quot;.  frankly, the two albums are strikingly similar, but they are both outstanding.  it is intelligent, singer/songwriter material delivered with the charismatic flair of that small gang of slyly mischievous british kids, who cause a little havoc, but smile intelligently, because they realize that life is better this way.  in other words they don't take their seriousness too seriously, and neither should you, but they wholeheartedly believe in what they say.  the fact that the music is equally beautiful makes this one of the best, most engaging and heartfelt records to come out of england.  it will be damned hard for them to progress musically and spiritually and make a record this good on their next attempt.
0553106635|5.0|In the first three books of a Song of Ice and fire Martin has achieved what seems to be so elusive among today's fantasy writers.  He develops round, realistic, human characters that, get this, you will actually care about.  You will see nobility in villains and cowardice in heroes, set against a fantasy world that is both gritty and imaginative.  The separate stories in the book are incredibly engaging and well written.  Just like the real world, anything can and does happen in Martin's novels.  Much to our dismay sometimes the good guys do die. Unlike obviously designated tragic figures of other fantasy novels you won't be able to tell which characters live or die, which I found to be incredibly refreshing.  I cannot wait for the next installment of the series, as I have found these novels to be the best I have had the pleasure to read in some time.
B000000OMB|4.0|When this album first came out, I have to admit I was surprised.  Some of the tracks were really quite ... dare I say it, catchy.  And there was even a Top 30-friendly single on the album ('Only Time will tell').  But wasn't this Carl Palmer -- he of the 70s triple album and serious devotee of classical percussionist James Blades?  And wasn't this also Steve Hose -- he of another 70s triple album and several serious solo albums.  And hadn't John Wetton starred on the seriously serious 'Red' in 74?  How could the three come together yet produce this Adult-Oriented stadium Rock?<br />Let's not forget Palmer's beginnings in the Crazy World of Arthur Brown and Atomic Rooster.  Or Wetton's bizarre phase with Uriah Heep.  And Geoff Downes was nominally half of 'Buggles', whose minimal output was unashamed pop.  The style of this, Asia's debut album wasn't a million miles from UK's eponymous LP of 1978, although it was distinctly more mainstream.<br />I like this album, the best of all the Asia output that I've heard.  I would have preferred the music to be a little more ambitious; there's a sense in which it's all been concocted to maximise the commercial return, which you couldn't say of UK.  But it's a good, undemanding listen.
B000001GK9|4.0|Karajan and Bernstein, I believe, are the two giant figures of the late 20th cnetury, except for the last 10 years, when it comes on conducting. And indeed, they are musically hostile to each other, diffrent countries, different ideas in music, and diffrent attitudes. I heard both Karajan's and Lenny's Performance with the Berlin Phil. Both are indeed fine. But I like Lenny's performance better. Besides, Bernstein is probably the best when it comes on Mahler, while Karajan on Beethoven. Overall, very good performance indeed. But I believe you should buy Lenny's performance with the Berlin Phil.

I belong to a generation that beatles are not a symbol. I'm sorry but is always the same old songs.
B000002C2E|5.0|I bought this CD when it was released, however it lay fallow for a few years as I relocated several times. Rediscovering this album was more than gratifying: it was inspiring. <br />As a novice Dylan fan, I knew little of his early work (I just liked the song &quot;Hurricane&quot; when I bought this album), but now, after hearing the hip irony in &quot;Million Miles&quot; and the tragic beauty of &quot;Standing in the Doorway&quot; I realized what I had been missing. Dylan is more than the occasional jukebox hero: He is an icon, a treasure, and &quot;Time out of Mind&quot; is the find of my CD collection...and should be the find of yours.

B00004XONN|5.0|This album, apparently a compilation of works from Radiohead's brainstorming in the early 1990s, not only breaks ground musically, but leaves one dizzy trying to desipher the almost cryptic lyrics. One thing is for certain, however, Radiohead is making albums for the album BUYER, not the cookie-cutter single release/TRL/MTV/Top 40 scene. And thank goodness! Finally, a band with name recognition recording MUSIC, instead of what is usually released: CRAP. This album is beyond genius, and &quot;when we're older&quot; (I'm 26) we'll talk about Kid A like our parents talk about Sargent Pepper.

B000007S5B|5.0|Being that every Doors album is different it would be impossible to compare Waiting For The Sun to their other works. Nonetheless, this is quite their psychedelic masterpiece... their last 3 albums were mainly blues and rock, and a little jazz thrown in on The Soft Parade. My favorite songs include Wintertime Love, Spanish Caravan, Five To One, and Not To Touch The Earth. This album would've been even greater if they had finished their epic-in-progress Celebration of the Lizard (which, by the way, Not To Touch The Earth was a small part of). Overall it's a timeless album, just like the rest of The Doors' stuff.

B00002E233|4.0|Ok comng into this movie i will half to admit that i had high expectations for it. For example i had expected the sharks that they portrayed to be enormous enormous. They were fairly big but not as big as you would think. One thing that  stirrs up the plot is how smart the sharks are. Alright im getting ahead of myself the story takes place in the middle of the Atlantic ocean at a great white shark testing lab, where they are testing chemicals that will make sharks smarter. To make a long story short something goes wrong, the sharks get out, and eat alot of people, and there is LL cool J the cook to help save the day. I enjoyed this movie a bunch and it was very entertaining.
0812589041|5.0|&quot;Ender's Game&quot; is a brilliant book. I had heard a lot about it from friends and just finally got around to reading it. I'm really glad that I did. In fact, I wish that I read it much earlier in my life.<br />I don't want to give the plot away and summarize the book. I didn't know anything coming into it, and I think that increased my enjoyment of the book. I will say this, though: Card covers some big issues, and he really validates the wisdom and potential of children. Some have complained that the children don't talk or act like children. I think that these people haven't given children the benefit of the doubt. They are much smarter than most people give them credit for. So, I found the characters to be quite believable -- particularly when you consider that virtually every child you come in contact with in the story is a genius!<br />Card's writing style is straight-forward and snappy. Most every detail moves the plot forward in some way. The chapters are paced well, and the ending... well, it's nothing short of perfect.<br />In his introduction (one of the better ones I have ever read) Card says that (and I am paraphrasing here...) &quot;If you enjoy this novel, think of it not as something I have created, but something we have created together.&quot; What a fabulous thing to say! It's something I think most people take for granted -- that a great deal of a story is what the reader brings to it (which is why movies are always disappointing to everyone). So, in that sense, I think that many people can create their own fantastic versions of &quot;Ender's Game&quot; in their heads. The scholar, the military person, the pacifist, the athlete -- there really is something that everyone can identify with. This book is for everyone. It is a must-read.<br />Very highly recommended.
6304126344|5.0|This movie contains Arnold Schwarzaneggar's best performance ever in my opinion. James cameron teamed up with arnold and linda hamilton to make one of the most famous scifi/action thrillers of all time. Basically the terminator comes back from the future to try to protect young John Connor from the new T-2000 model of the terminators. This movie contains more action than should be allowed on a movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this and kept me falling off my seat the whole duration of the movie.
0780629450|5.0|Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is the best since Lawrence Olivier's.  The film is beautifully shot, and some of the set is stunningly effective--a hall of mirrors in particular is used to great effect.  Branagh does a great job as Hamlet, and Kate Winslet (this shocked me) is the best Ophelia I have ever seen.  Remarkably well-cast and with skillful camerawork, this is a Hamlet well worth seeing.  It's refreshing to be able to watch a version of any Shakesperean film which hasn't cut some wonderful scenes purely to bring the length down, and this movie lets us view Hamlet &quot;uncut.&quot;  There is only one scene in the entire 4-hour movie which is irritating from a cinematic perspective--a scene where Hamlet's character on his way to Norway delivers an impassionated soliloquy against a very obviously artificial background, causing the viewer to have a frame break (&quot;Hey!  That's not sky!  That looks like a blue screen!&quot;)--and only one tiresome scene in four hours means a pretty fantastic movie.
B00004XONN|5.0|followed by the unexplainable creative propaganda of what radiohead has become, comes an unexplainable creative expression that doesn't seem meant to be.  kid a has crept (no pun intended) into the soul of everyone who loves music in it most pure and unadulterated form.  it is unexplainable because yorke and company has entered a realm of imaginative genius without trying.  again.  this album, comparable to &quot;ok computer&quot; (without any obvious musical similarities), has become an anthem to what everyone thinks is beautiful.  to what everyone thinks is what music should be.  without trying, they have tried to make themselves an unwritten epoch of an untold story.  but it's told.  it's been written.  it's here.  welcome.

0679879269|3.0|After waiting for months, I finally was able to read this book and I was very dissapointed.  The first to books of the series totally pulled you in; you did not want to stop reading.  The Amber Spyglass was not like this.  The begining was confusing and I thought that it would clear up, but it didn't. <br />Some questions I would ask the author:  Why did Mrs Coultler have a personality switch?  In the first two books she was a villan, but she suddenly became motherly. Why was the amber spyglass created?  It seemed to me that Mary Malone just woke up one day and decided to make some great gizmo. How did the ghosts of Wills father and the areonout fight the war? I thought that they dissapeared when they left the underworld. Why did Lyra and Will fall in love?  I don't totally see how two 13 year olds can fall in love like that.<br />Although I complain, there were still some good aspects of the book.  The parts about the relationship of the daemons and how we all have one was fascinating.  I also found the parts about God interesting.  <br />Basicly, this is a good book, but it falls way short of the first two.
B000002UAX|5.0|...those who wish to critically evaluate other albums and/or artists should not do so here. Presumably, anyone looking at this page wants to see reviews of the &quot;White Album&quot;; honestly, people, stick to the subject at hand! <br />As for the &quot;White Album&quot;, I would basically reiterate most of what others have said. &quot;Revolver&quot; may represent the Fabs' crowning triumph as a unit, but this collection shows how stunningly gifted they were as individual musicians.<br />Of course, as with all the Beatles CDs, the sound quality and packaging are not up to what they could be. Hopefully, Apple/EMI will be getting around to a full upgrading of ALL the Beatles albums in the not-too-distant future.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Three Dollar Bill - cool!<br />Significant Other - Even Better!<br />Chocalte Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water - Go back to   Three Dollar Bill...<br />This CD isn't as great as their others, Limp Bizkit could have did a lot better. Only if you're a big LB fan, I would suggest it to add on to your collection. Cool Cover, though!
B00000G28U|4.0|This is an alright album, and since it is the censored version I gave it 4 stars...I would probably give the regular version 4 stars, but the only song they cut out on here is &quot;So What&quot;, and I dont even listen to that song much anyway. I picked the edited Garage up on accident, because none of their previous albums had parental advisories on them. So I figured what the heck, and then I heard all these cuss words on someone else's cd and I was like, whoa...what is wrong with mine? And I will tell you, that annoying &quot;beeping&quot; sound gets to your nerves once in awhile. They just dont blurp them out, it makes a loud -beep-. So my advice to you is, if you like hearing beeping sounds that is cool, but if you dont, get the explicit version...and if you dont like cuss words, just skip the &quot;So What&quot; track on disc two. That is my advice and have a nice day :)
B00004UEEY|4.0|The Goofy Movie is a great addition to any home collection. Goofy and his son Max go on a trip full of fun, music and laughs. On the way to some of Goofy's favorite places they run into some very humorous adventures that bring them closer as father and son. It is a great movie with excellent music that keeps you humming even after it is over. My daughter and I have watched this movie numerous times and we still love it. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and great songs.
6302820448|5.0|Bill Murray makes this movie great with his hilarious biting attitude. The unique concept of the film allows the plot to move in many different directions, keeping the movie interesting throughout. Definitely Bill Murray's best movie, and one of the best comedies ever made.
B0000025VU|4.0|The 80's were probably Dylan's weakest decade. And Infidels is one of his best albums of the decade. It is not as good as many of his albums from the 60' and the 70' or as his recent recordings. But that is the &quot;internal ranking&quot; - comparing Dylan to Dylan. However, if you compare it with the outside world, it stands pretty high. Dylan is incredibly productive and always suprises. Couple of songs from Infidels can be regarded as a Dylan's classics - Jokerman, Licence to Kill, I and I. The contribution of Mark Knopfler and his guitar is also visible and helpful. Bang for the buck. Buy it.
B00004YKUX|5.0|You don't have to be a country music fan to enjoy this collection of emotional tunes from Johnny Cash. The first track, &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot; is just one beautiful accoustic guitar and one low plaintive voice. &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot; was of course a rock song when Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers first produced it. (In fact, Petty is listed under vocals for this song, but I don't hear him, just Johnny Cash.) If I had to categorize Cash's version of this song, I'ld call it folk music, but why call it anything? It's a piece of simplicity and greatness, call it anything you want. Cash's rendition of &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot; is far better than Petty's, and that's saying a lot. Then there's the second track, Neil Diamond's &quot;Solitary Man.&quot; I'm no Neil Diamond fan, but if I were him, I would give up singing and start writing songs for Johnny Cash. There can not be a better version of &quot;Solitary Man&quot; on this earth. The single guitar played with Johnny's low voice is and will be unmatched. Most of the later tracks are not as well known as these two, but every track is very good and several are excellent. (I wish I could get a glimpse of Johnny Cash's music collection; based on these selections, I'ld guess that he listens to a little bit of everything.)<br />My only complaint is that several songs end slightly abrubtly, but maybe that's to be expected from music that is so simple and under-produced.<br />One other thing that I should mention is the really great accoustic guitar and other accompanying performances throughout this CD. It would be easy to miss them this because Johnny's voice is so absorbing, but make sure you don't.<br />I highly recommend this CD for music lovers who appreciate simplicity, great guitar playing, and Johnny's unmatchable voice.
B00003CX8J|2.0|My husband had seen this movie in the theaters but I missed it.  I was eagerly looking forward to watching it on our 5.1 surround system/widescreen digital TV...however, the sound shifts between (and even in the middle of) scenes were so dramatic that I spent the whole movie changing the volume.  Our volume was as high as 20 at some points (usually during dialogue), and as low as 8 (during the storm and fight scenes, for example).  The sound quality was OK (it is, after all, THX), but the constant volume adjustments left me really irritated and I will not watch this DVD again.
B00003CWMI|5.0|I have just seen Bicentennial Man (on cable) for the second time.  I loved it even more than my first time seeing it in the theater, because I knew the story in advance and could relax and look forward to it, without being overwhelmed by the wonderful special effects and little tidbits of wonderment that pervade the movie.  Quite simply, Robin Williams portrays a robot who becomes human.  But, it's so much deeper than that.  I must say it is one of Robin's best works... and I've seen them all.  It has his delightful comedy, but moreover, his perfect portrayal with pathos and beguiling charm.  The movie begins with the robot (dubbed Andrew) being introduced to the family (with Sam Neill as the father).  One of the little girls in the family makes a quick connection with the new robot (Williams), and they become fast friends... for life, as it turns out.  As time goes by, Andrew (Williams) becomes more and more a member of the family.  But, Andrew also becomes more human, and eventually goes to search for his identity, and to seek out others like him.  The film moves rather quickly from one time period to another, since they have to cover Andrew's lifespan of two-hundred years (hence the title).  Throughout his life, he is constantly evolving, whether mechanically, thru technological improvements, or just by learning human qualities.  The thrust of it is that he eventually becomes human, but is not recognized as such until the end of his life. (There is a very moving speech he gives to some delegation who will decide if he is human or not.)  It is a landmark film of human emotions and human joy, all experienced and displayed by a robot.  It is not the comic fluff of some earlier Williams' films, nor the hardhitting drama of some of his others.  Rather, it is the compelling joyousness and heartwarming comedy of a machine who wants to be human... played expertly by Williams, of course.  I plan to watch it again, very soon.  It is a great movie.
B00003CXDF|1.0|Am I the ONLY person who noticed the similarity in plots between this movie and Hitchcock's Notorious?! It's basically a remake. Why didn't any of the critics notice this? Save your money and buy that flick instead. I'm still underwhelmed by John Woo's direction. And that stupid motorcycle jousting scene at the end, PLEASE!

B00000AFGM|5.0|On first hearing this album the day of its release, several words sprung to mind; innovative, inspiring, original, landmark. Many people hated this at first glimpse, claiming Manson had &quot;sold out&quot;, &quot;gone commercial&quot;, and lost his edge. I would have to disagree on all points. Did the band suddenly sign with Virgin? Did they make an album garunteed to sell billions and hit the top 10? Are the songs weaker or more &quot;pop&quot;? NO. They took a huge risk with this album. They risked their fan base, they alterred the image and the politics of the band, with no guarantee of success. But luckily, it paid off. While a large proportion of the fan base were repulsed by this album, turning on the band, forgetting the principle of a band evolving and maturing, a whole new fan base opened up. Suddenly a branch of older listeners began tuning in to the new, improved, mature Manson.<br />I have to admit, I did not love Antichrist, I found some of the racism and prejudice which Manson screeched about quite offensive. And credit where credit's due, the band changed all that for me. Mechanical Animals reverses some of the negative aspects of Antichrist, laying the cards on the table, saying &quot;Hey look, Antichrist was just to get some attention, this is what I really think...&quot; &quot;Coma White&quot; and &quot;The Great Big White World&quot; take the racism back, telling things the way they are. It is indeed a great big white world, and we ARE drained of our colours... This album launches the band away from metal resting them comfortably inbetween darkwave and industrial, with all the best bits of both integrated into one magnificant whole. The pounding of the anthemic &quot;Rock is Dead&quot; and &quot;New Model No. 15&quot; compliment nicely the slow, painful resonance of &quot;I Want To Disappear&quot; or &quot;The Last Day on Earth&quot;. An even more magnificent combination than &quot;Beautiful People&quot; and &quot;Cryptorchid&quot;. At last, something you can really let loose and dance to in a club, music with vitality and enthusiasm, music that sounds like the band enjoyed themselves creating it. <br />While lacking some of the playfulness of Portrait, and some of the squeeks and groans of Antichrist, Mechanical Animals does something different and insightful that no one has done since Trent Reznor recorded &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. The influence of David Bowie and Marc Bolan hold a strong presence, but Manson is doing something new with his influences, rather than mimicking them, he is bringing them head first into a new era, to a new audience. This album truely reminded me of why I love music so passionately.<br />This album is a MUST HAVE for anyone who enjoys contrast in their music, because it offers a bit of everything you need from a band.
0684853523|5.0|In my experiences as a reader and as a writer, Stephen King holds the distinction of being the only author who has ever made me angry.  This was in the Spring of 1992 and the result of an interview with the best-selling author that appeared in the March issue of Writer's Digest magazine.  In that article, the interviewer points out that King &quot;...once wrote that extensive outlining was the last refuge of a hack...&quot;  At the time, I was really just starting to take myself seriously as a writer and was trying to do my best to live up to the commitment I had made to myself and to the craft.  The problem was, I was guilty of fairly &quot;extensive outlining&quot; of the projects I was working on at the time.  In my defense, I found that even with the outlining I did, the stories I was writing and the characters I was writing about tended to take on a life of their own and went in directions surprsing to their creator.  Nevertheless, it hurt very much that a writer of Stephen King's caliber, a writer at Stephen King's level of success, would think of me as a hack for how I approached the craft of writing.<br />Did I let Mr. King's views stop me as a writer?  Of course not.  Nevertheless, for the next eight years, I did not read a Stephen King novel.  I flat out refused to spend my good hard-earned money on an author who would think so little of me as a writer if he knew me either personally or professionally.  In that time I have come to know a modest amount of success as a writer:  I've had a couple of my short stories published and the first part of a planned four-part novel of mine was e-published this past summer.  I have also come to know more joy and happiness than I ever thought possible because of writing; of actually sitting down and creating stories -- even if not another soul ever reads them.<br />Late in the Spring of 2000, and for the first time in eight years, I read a Stephen King novel.  Maybe, I had misjudged him.  Maybe, I had taken something far too personally that was never meant to be personal in the first place.  Regardless, I read the book Gerald's Game with an almost overwhelming sense of rediscovery combined with an equally overwhelming sense of awe.  I was beyond amazed by Mr. King's ability to take the situation of a woman handcuffed to a bed, her dead husband on the floor nearby, and no hope of help from anyone but herself, and stretch it out while at the same time managing to keep the narrative as interesting, involving and suspenseful the way he did for some three-hundred odd pages.  As a reader, I couldn't put the book down for long.  As a writer, I was inspired beyond measure by the high quality of the writing.  In short order, I read Rose Madder, Bag of Bones, and Dolores Claiborne, and was equally impressed by all three titles.  Clearly, I realized, Mr. King was an author I still very much enjoyed reading and who, through the magic of his stories, still had much to teach me about writing, despite his views on the methods that work for him as a writer.  <br />All of this is why, maybe somewhat surprisingly, I looked forward to the publication of On Writing, King's memoir of the craft.  The first part of On Writing is semi-autobiographical as Mr. King tells about some of the things that happened in his life leading up to the publication of his first novel, Carrie.  The second part of On Writing deals with what writing is and how seriously you need to take it if you're going to be an honest-to-god writer; the tools you'll need to be that writer which include everything from vocabulary to grammar, to skills with brevity and dialogue; what actually writing means including everything from plotting to characterization, scene setting, pacing, revision and more.  The last part of the book focuses on what writing has meant to Mr. King, particularly in light of the recent accident in which he was very nearly killed, supplemented by a booklist of books he has enjoyed as both a reader and a writer.  Throughout, Mr. King writes with his dry sense of humor intact as well as with a poignancy that is, at many times, surprisingly touching.  Not to mention the fact that what he has to say is, in the end, truly inspiring.<br />While you don't have to be a writer to enjoy On Writing, I think writers will get the most out of this very worthwhile book.  They would also be wise to keep one of Mr. King's main points in mind, and that is:  &quot;If you don't have time to read, you don't have the time (or the tools) to write.  Simple as that.&quot;  Reading any of Mr. King's forty-odd novels certainly won't hurt.  Enough said.
0385484518|5.0|If this is your thing, you will absolutely love 'Tuesday with Morrie'. Even if it isn't, it is almost impossible to ignore this simplistic and short book. The lessons given by the author's mentor, the slowly dying and former favourite unviersity professor Morrie are both relevant to modern life, as well as inspiring and heartwarming. I believe the world would be a kinder more loving place if we were required to read this beautiful novel, for even the most disbelieving and cynical of individuals will come to find themselves slowly taken in by Morrie's captivating messages. Brilliant, a self help at it's finest, a short and interesting read and wonderfully entertaining and well-written.
0399146253|5.0|I discovered Patricia Cornwell about five years ago, when I bought and read her exceptional first novel, Postmortem.  As both a reader and a writer, I was deeply impressed with Postmortem.  That book had an undeniable intensity that made it all but impossible to put down; the writing was very high-quality, the story itself was involving, and the central character -- Dr. Kay Scarpetta, the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia -- was a vivid and appealing creation, making her particularly enjoyable to read about.  Put it this way, I devoured Postmortem, and soon after devoured the rest of the Kay Scarpetta books available in paperback at that time including:  Body of Evidence, All That Remains, Cruel and Unusual, The Body Farm, From Potter's Field and Cause of Death.  After that, it was hardcovers all the way, which meant year-long waits for Unnatural Exposure, Point of Origin, Black Notice, and now, The Last Precinct, the latest novel in this outstanding series.  The Last Precinct begins shortly after the events that culminated last year's Black Notice; police are swarming all over Kay Scarpetta's beloved Richmond home in the wake of suspected serial killer Jean-Baptiste Chandonne's violent and unexpected attack on her life, and the injured Scarpetta is miserable enough to flee to her best friend's home to protect herself from the insanity of this invasion of her private life.  Not long after, Scarpetta learns, to her utter disbelief, that she herself is the subject of a nasty criminal investigation.  Understandably, she becomes paranoid and goes on the defensive.  What follows is the riveting account of how she manages to deal with the sheer madness her life has become while at the same time doing what she can to help prove Jean-Baptiste Chandonne's guilt as a sadistic killer.  One of Cornwell's most interesting achievements with The Last Precinct is that she manages to turn Scarpetta into a victim without actually killing her off; a victim whose life is dissected andsubjected to as much intense scrutiny as one of the bodies the formidable Chief Medical Examiner would have no doubt posted/autopsied herself.  Along the way we learn more about Scarpetta's past, her emotions and her true feelings than ever before.  Lingering questions from past novels, most significantly about Scarpetta's long-time love, FBI profiler Benton Wesley, are also resolved in The Last Precinct in surprising, unexpected and satisfying ways.  Scarpetta's co-hort, Officer Pete Marino, and her niece, Lucy, are larger than life in the story, too.  To say, as some reviewers have, that The Last Precinct is no more than a rehash of events in Black Notice, is an unfair understatement.  To me, The Last Precinct is a logical outgrowth and continuation of those events, and Cornwell not only deepens them, but makes them even more sinister and suspenseful than you can imagine.  As always, Cornwell's attention to detail is impeccable in The Last Precinct, from the scenes of grisly autopsies to the dialogue that practically snaps right off the page; everything in the book seems authentic rather than fabricated or contrived, and that has been the case since Postmortem.  By the end of The Last Precinct, it is clear how things will never, ever be the same for Dr. Kay Scarpetta.  I, for one, look forward to the possibilities Cornwell leaves open and to wherever she decides to take her alter-ego in future books.  If you have any interest in suspense novels involving crime, not very many authors write them as well as Cornwell.  What shines like a welcoming beacon in all of her books is how passionately she hates the evil killers do and how just as passionately she cares about true justice.  I highly recommend The Last Precinct as well as the five-star reads:  Postmortem, Body of Evidence, All That Remains, Cruel and Unusual, The Body Farm, From Potter's Field, Cause of Death, Unnatural Exposure, Point of Origin and Black Notice.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nasir Jones let 'Illmatic' out in 1994.  And since then I have heard a MILLION AND ONE tries to copy its formula, none have been successful.  This is a perfect record.  Every single rhyme is perfect, and every beat is banging.  DJ Premier, Q-Tip, Pete Rock, and others do a WONDERFUL job.  If anyone tells you this album isn't 5 stars, or is over-rated.  They are lying to them selves.<br />Pick this up along with- Common- Resurrection
B00000J7J4|4.0|Not being old enough to remember the 'first coming' of Santana back in the Woodstock days, I will write this review from the perspective of someone to whom SUPERNATURAL is the first taste of Santana.    I think the new generation will enjoy this CD a lot, as it offers them a lot of contemporary artists collabing with the Latin rock outfit (such as Wyclef, Eagle-eye Cherry etc.). But let's not get sidetracked, it is Santana's record, not theirs. Everyone will know SMOOTH, as it was a huge hit both sides of the pond, and if you liked it, then buy the album. It is one of the more up-tempo tracks on the LP, which offers slower tunes &amp; more classic rock-y numbers (such as PUT YOUR LIGHTS ON). <br /> Personal favourites are MARIA, MARIA, which has a kicking bassline, excellent latin style guitar and smooth vocals from The Product-Ghetto &amp; Blues. Wyclef also puts in an appearance, it had to be done. SMOOTH, a superb feel-good track, and one of the best on the album. You'll be putting this one on when you're in a good mood. I also like PUT YOUR LIGHTS ON &amp; the chilled out EL FAROL, nice n slow.<br /> In short this record brings the taste of Latin rock &amp; blues to your CD collection, &amp; will appeal to the younger generation as well as the older era of people that remember the first time round for Carlos &amp; co. A definite must buy, that gets 4 well-deserved stars.    &quot;Like seven inches from the midday sun&quot;
B000000H64|5.0|Fear Factory's second studio release is arguably one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  While Soul of the new...was mainly a straight up death metal release, in Demanufacture there sound has improved and Burton C. Bell shows greater variety in his vocal delivery. Fear Factory have a sound which is brutally heavy, but tight and incredibly focused, the sound combines well with the ongoing concept of man VS machine, with the music so fast, tight and well produced it seems that only machines could create a sound with such immpeccable timing.<br />Burton C Bell is one of the metal worlds heaviest vocalists though he showcases his ability to sing beautiful heartfelt melodies in each song while the music never loses it heaviness. The best songs are Hunter-Killer, Self Bias Resistor,Replica, Flashpoint and the amazing title track. Get this as well as the other FF CD's, anything from Machine Head, Pantera and G//Z/R.
6303379214|5.0|For anyone who dreams of meeting that special someone at that right moment, this is the movie for you! The romance of Peter and Faith (Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei) is what people dream about. Simply bumping into the person in Rome, and soon finding yourselves in love is so idealistic, you have have to stop and remind yourself that it is just a movie. However, it makes you wonder - is there that one person out there just for us and it's just a matter time before you find them? It's such a beautiful and this movie only makes it come true. A romance written in the stars is truly a romance worth having!

6300215512|5.0|SUNSET BOULEVARD is wonderfully witty, comic and black, and a shocking and intense heart-accelerating film. It is elegant and glamorous, the feel of Hollywood glamour to the screen. The profound context of a faded actress, bitter and resentful when sound came to the movies. The movie allows you to sympathize Desmond and the fall of the silents, but then haves your pity turn into horror when the true madness is scene. Pretty scary.... really... A masterpiece. One of my favorites of all-time! This is one of the best of the 50's, often compared with ALL ABOUT EVE(a great movie, too). Gloria Swanson gives a great performance and Billy Wilder did a great job, too.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Whats up with all you whining people,saying that Limp Bizkit has changed their music.They havnt changed and have just improved !!
B00003CWMI|2.0|Bicentennial Man is one of those movies that makes you wish you had directed it so you could correct all those flaws that butcher an otherwise great film: starring Robin Williams as Andrew - the  robot who was first the household servant, then the wayward traveler - Bicentennial Man could have been the most powerful and inspirational movie of the year, but second-rate acting, a colossal plot-hole, and a horrific script quite effectively shot the film out of the sky.<br />To start off with the positive side of things, I feel the movie had much to offer visually.  It was filmed with a fair degree of care and talent, and such moments as Andrew's examination of the spider web and his construction of the toy horse for Little Miss had a distinct emotional impact.  Also, the set and makeup design deserve serious congratulation, as they inevitably entailed numerous expenses and had the fortunate effect of producing an equally exorbitant result.<br />Another aspect I admired was that the makers of Bicentennial Man were notthe type to clip short an important story at the gain of making their product &quot;market length&quot;.<br />Unfortunately, the happy story ends there.  <br />One of the main problems with it was that it starred Robin Williams.  Now, don't get me wrong!  I consider Robin Williams to be one of the better actors Hollywood has known, (Dead Poets Society and Mrs. Doubtfire are among my favorite films) but sadly, his performances have been reduced to a formula.  There are only so many characters and personalities that an actor can portray before his portrayal becomes redundant, and after a quarter of a century of movies, Williams has reached that stage.  Consequently, Bicentennial Man lost any spark of uniqueness it might have had, because its lead actor, the anchor of the viewer's emotional connection to the movie, looked bored.  This in and of itself was enough to do in the film, although a good performance by Sam Neil somewhat made up for this tragic flaw.<br />Another major problem was a titanic plot hole that I still can't understand how the creators missed.     When Andrew first enters the Martin household, he outlines Asimov's notorious Three Laws of Robotics, and makes note of their hierarchy.  The fact that these laws were never again mentioned in the movie was alone a significant problem, but the degree to which they were forgotten is unforgivable.  To avoid spoiling the ending, I'll limit my explanation to this: when you're watching the final scene, remember the First Law of Robotics, as well as the fact that it supersedes the Second Law, and then you'll understand the enormity of the error.   Finally, and most terminally, the script was possibly the worst ever presented in a large-budget film - yes, even worse than Titanic's.  The lines were not only entirely contrived and unbelievable, but their quality made me wonder if they were written by kindergartners.  Examples?  Mrs. Martin, when confronting a boyfriend of her rebellious daughter, yells at the antagonist, &quot;You big ball of slime!&quot;  Andrew accidentally breaks a highly regarded toy, to which that same daughter declares, &quot;You're screwed.&quot;  Throughout the movie, Andrew is fond of making comments that express his literal understanding of the world, an attribute classic to robots which may have been funny in movies released in the 50s but now is nauseatingly worn-out.    <br />At the film's most torturous moment,  Andrew is faced with a beautiful robot. She asks him if he can experience emotions, and he responds, &quot;No.&quot;  She then flips her hand and says, &quot;Well, sucks to be you!&quot;  I'm not kidding.  It's in there.  <br />Collectively, these flaws immensely outweighed any strong points the movie might have had, making it fundamentally lousy, but lousy in the worst possible way, because unlike movies that are entirely bad, you can't stop thinking about Bicentennial Man: the few crying positive sides keep coming back to you until you are driven crazy with your futile wish to make the movie better.  The concept was present, as was the heart, but the class dramatically missed the mark and so Bicentennial Man plunges into oblivion.
0930289528|5.0|Moore's an absolute genius, as demonstrated by this, Miracleman, Swamp Thing, and Watchmen.  In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent installation of a president who was not democratically elected, I thought of this one and its uncomfortably accurate predictions of a rising tide of fascism.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|I was at the mall shopping for Xmas presents and it seemed that every store was blasting the same horrible Xmas music.   The music was really bad watered-down dance updates of Christmas Classics and the singer was this awful white girl trying desperately to sound like Whitney Houston and failing miserably.  When I got to the checkout counter, there was a display that said, &quot;We're Playing: Christina Aguilera's My Kind of Christmas.&quot;  This is my first encouter with Christina Aguilera, and hopefully, it will be my last.  It was painful, actually painful to listen to.  Everyone in the store was muttering to each other, &quot;Why don't they turn this @8%! off?&quot;
B000050XEI|3.0|I was quite excited back in September or October when I found out that Enya was finally putting out a new album. Now I wish she had taken a little more time in the studio to write more songs. The first problem I have with this cd is that it is too short. I was stunned to find out that it clocked in less than 40 minutes. No one should have to pay full price for a cd that is less than 40 minutes. I personally feel ripped off. My other problem with this cd is that some of her songs sounds like her other songs. I felt like at times that I was listening to &quot;Watermark&quot; part two. Her songs aren't completely terrible but I wouldn't call them original either. I enjoy listening to this cd on a cold winter day or when I go to bed.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This cd is great. I actually got it about two days before I saw Dido in concert, and in those days, I fell in love with it completely. Dido has a great voice, and uses it in spiteful and beautiful ways on 'No Angel'. She has something to say, and seems to find the best ways to say what she needs to. Listening to this record, you find that you, too, can be fulfilled by hearing this songstress vent her soul. I've got to warn you, I am a teenage girl, and in the direct target audience for Dido's musice. I found it incredibly inspiring, but, you may not. Instead, you could see it as sweet dreck. I recommend listening to the clips Amazon has posted. Another thing- this isn't a happy record, so if you're looking for up-tempo songs, this isn't for you. It does have an uplifting message though. Thanks! I highly recommend this cd!
6301404440|5.0|You can't say enough about this movie. The characters come to life in such a way that you forget that they're animated after a while; they become fellow actors to Bob Hoskins and company. The cartoon short at the beginning is also a hoot, but it's just warming up for the insanity and anarchy that follows. My favorite part: Patty Cake, and when you see it, you'll know why.

B00000J6AG|5.0|I listened to 30 second clips of every song on this CD that this website would let me and I was dissappointed because I REALLY wanted to hear that pretty song on that one car commercial. I really like that song but I don't know what it's called or anything else about &quot;Moby&quot; except that he or that band is totally warped and psycotic...Although these charateristics may seem too vile to display the overall effort put into this CD being noticible; I feel that a 5 star rating thoroughly represents the talent and foreward recognition of this wonderful band. Figuratively Speaking
630289915X|3.0|George Bailey had one dream in life, to get out of the small town of Bedford Falls, see a few new sights, and have a few adventures.  His first shot of this was to be his college years.  This fell through, he stayed in Bedford Falls and his brother had the college career.  Throughout his entire life, every attempt to get away from Bedford Falls, even for a week or two, was thwarted by some business or family responsibility.  The poor guy never even got to go on his own honeymoon!<br />Others came and went, but not poor old George Bailey.  Finally, on one Christmas Eve, as a result of the chicanery of a nasty old grinch type businessman in town, George's business problems, on top of all of his thwarted ambitions, got so bad and he became so despondent that he was on the verge of suicide.<br />Along came an angel named Clarence who had been a bit of a failure in his own right.  He'd never been able to earn his wings and his absolute last chance to earn them was to keep Bailey from committing suicide.  In a sort of reverse version of Dickens' tale of Scrooge seeing the ghosts of his past, present, and future, Bailey's angel showed him what miserable lives his (Bailey's) friends and families would have had had there been no George Bailey...<br />Do you really think that the description of a wonderful life is one in which you never even got a trip around the block and the absolute high point is that you didn't commit suicide?  Doesn't meet my definition.
B00001PE4D|3.0|As must be clear by now, this movie is an update of the famous &quot;Les Liasions Dangereuses&quot; (sp?). It succeeds in transporting a story set some centuries ago to a contemporary setting, but it is not as tight as it should be. The (first-time) director is clearly not capable of making a good movie, but his cinematographer, set designer and costume designer help him more than he deserves. Overall, the actors are well chosen and perform admirably. Especially Sarah Michelle Gellar and Reese Witherspoon give a good performance, but Ryan Phillipe never manages to be believable as a leading man. Although he seems to try, he can never dispel the early image of a boring, snotty rich kid. When watching the deleted scenes, one realizes that the director had a big problem grasping the strenghts of the character and because of this, Phillipe's &quot;change&quot; is never believable. Still, audio and video-wise, this DVD is excellent, and there are far worse movies out there to watch. Just forget about the director, he is a hack.
B00003CXE7|5.0|GLADIATOR is the best movie I have ever seen. It is grand in scale, with an excellent cast and plot. General Maximus Decimus Meridius was a loyal servant to Emperor Marcus Aurelius (played wonderfully by Richard Harris). Upon the emperor's death, Maximus is betrayed by Rome. He then must become a gladiator to win his freedom. His quest for freedom will make for a great film.<br />  This film has grand special effects that transport us back to Ancient Rome. We are able to see the splendour, the atrocity, and moral decay that was Rome. We look past this, as we see a great man's struggle for freedom and justice. This struggle is the main point of this masterpiece. If you like violence, fighting, or period pieces you will love GLADIATOR. Buy this epic today.

0805062971|5.0|The abstruse bone-chilling tale of Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk tells the story of an anonymous consumer driven young man, who feels emptiness in his ordinary existece. He is an insomniac and the only way he could cure his sleep disorder is by going to self-help groups. The man is an avid flyer due to his job, and on one flight he encounters upon a man by the name of Tyler Durden. Tyler has diverse vocations, such as a film projectionist and a soap maker. After a peculiar circumstance the nameless character moves into Tyler's home. Both together discpver a way for them to pursue past their confined and restrained lives by forming Fight Club, an after-hour boxing match assemblage in the basement of a bar. Fight Club becomes a place where the typical man goes to find mitigation in their diminutive life; where one man can mentally become a puissant dictator by making another man's face hemorrhage; a place where one guy can knock the living daylights out of another guy. Tyler, the true mastermind behind Fight Club, becomes an underground image, to what it appears, every man in the United States. Fight Club develops into a widespread gathering and Tyler takes advantage of his power by telling his followers to start commotion and mayhem all over the country (to give the rest of the stort way would be just wrong). Fight Club by far was one of the most commanding stories I had ever read. Though it did not come as a shocker to me since I had seen the movie, I still found myself biting my nails at times with amusement and apprehension. Palahniuk suffuses the book with symbolism, and it seems to me that Fight Club is exclusively based on the Nazi genre and Hitler's regime since most of the book deals with world domination and how one man's mind can become manipulated and controlled. The book is truly fit for any reader who takes pleasure in comedy, horror, or even romance. I found myself being taken adrift sometimes in the novel as if I were going from one place to another. Still, this is a read you do not want to miss out on.
B00003CXE7|5.0|If every DVD included the extras that this version of Gladiator contains, there would be at least one DVD player in every American household within 6 months. It's beautiful to see a package that puts it all together.<br />As for the movie: There are a lot of flaws, but the upside is too far up to rate it lower than 5 stars. The main flaws are in the script, which includes far too many canned soliloquys and too much informational dialogue. Other problems crop up in the area of logistics (for instance, how did his hands get untied? isn't it illegal for a Roman citizen to be enslaved? etc.)<br />But the numerous strokes of genius far outweigh these problems. For one thing, the movie utilizes &quot;scenes from the collective consciousness&quot; to great effect and give the movie a sense of dignified closure that I've never seen elsewhere. Stunning. Honest, my favorite scene in the movie is the brief opening shot of Maximus with his hand running through the wheat. Beautiful idea. The use of such visual tokens keep the emotional tension in the movie going until its perfect release at the end.<br />Also very notable were the performances of Crowe &amp; Phoenix. Crowe's facial expressions told more than most of the dialogue in the movie combined. Phoenix was incredible as a tormented, unloved, and even pitiable tyrant -- he was perfect in this role.
0684800713|2.0|In &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; Hemingway, through his alter-ego, Jake Barnes, tells us that the true meaning of &quot;aficionad' is passion.  In Spain, there is a more restrictive meaning.  'Aficianado' only means one who is passionate about the bulls.  In fact, the concept is so restrictive that some bull fighters are considered to be just 'commercial' bull fighters and are not passionate enough about their chosen profession to be considered 'aficionados.'  This is so according to Hemingway.<br />In the broader sense of the word, Hemingway, in this book, reveals himself (as Jake Barnes) to be an aficionado when it comes to boxing, drinking, fishing, and bull-fighting.<br />I had a problem with one aspect of &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot;  I found Hemingway's excessive use of negative ethnic stereotyping to be troublesome.  For starters, he has created in Robert Cohn, a character who is emotionally unstable and thoroughly unlikeable because of his 'Jewishness.'  Following are a few examples of this portrayal:<br />In reference to Cohn  (observations of Barnes and his friends):<br />&quot;He had a hard, Jewish streak.&quot;<br />Brett's gone off with (other) men, but they weren't ever Jews.&quot;<br />&quot;That Cohn gets to me.  He's got that Jewish superiority.&quot;<br />&quot;That kike.&quot;<br />In reference to Jews in general:  &quot;She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to the Jews.  They're not really Jews.  We just call them Jews.  They're Scotsmen, I believe.&quot;<br />There are numerous other instances, but these already cited should suffice as examples of Hemingway's Jewish stereotyping.  <br />He went after other groups too.  To wit:<br />On Blacks:  &quot;The n  ,  ,  ,  ,  drummer waved at Brett.  He was all lips and teeth.&quot;<br />On gays:  &quot;I wanted to swing on one  .  .  .  .  to shatter that superior, simpering composure.&quot;<br />He didn't quit there either.  He went after the Frenchand, on numerous occasions, showed his disdain for all casual tourists.<br />There is so much of this sort of prejudicial stereotyping throughout the book that it was ruined for me.  It's too bad, because his bull-fight descriptions obviously came from an aficionado but were, for me, tainted by his attitudes.

6304712936|5.0|In my opinion, this film is one of the '80 decade film (maybe, with Brazil in a different style). OK, it's a fiction, but a great film. Th film itself is an Opera, with the Mozart music. It recall to us what is a great fim : the intact emotion. Mavelous
B00004SCX6|3.0|I gave Britney and OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN 3 stars for the music; not her voice (because she really cannot sing). I admit: This music from OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN is addicting, I wonder if they put some type of music drug in it? And yes, I believe that on some of the tracks from this CD, Britney actually sings OK. I think OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN album is somewhat better than her ...BABY ONE MORE TIME album (but aren't most second albums better than the first?), but it's still basically the same kind of songs and music. Although songs like &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;, &quot;(You Drive Me) Crazy&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, and &quot;Born To Make You Happy&quot;, are better than some of the songs from OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN. Britney has grown from her last album (as most people do). She still wears the same wild style of clothes and her personality is the same, but her style in music has somewhat changed. My favorite tracks from OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN are &quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot;, &quot;Can't Make You Love Me&quot;, and &quot;When Your Eyes Say It&quot;. I also think &quot;Where Are You Now&quot; is good, too. Maybe next time, Britney should work on her voice more and stop lip-syncing at concerts and stuff. Luckily, for me, I didn't waste any money on this CD because at my younger sister's birthday party, she got two copies of Britney Spear's OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN, and she kept one copy while I kept the other. If you are a Britney fan, then this is definitely for you, it's even for you if you're a fan of &quot;Bubblegum Pop&quot; such as artists like *N SYNC (another horrible group). But if you want Pop music and don't like &quot;Bubblegum Pop&quot;, then you should get Christina Aguilera, Backstreet Boys, Aaron Carter, Whitney, Mariah, Jessica Simpson, 98 Degrees, Mandy Moore, LeAnne Rimes, or Celine Dion.
B0000028UK|5.0|Let's face it America, the entire reputation of Ten is built around four of its songs:  Jeremey, Aive, Black, and Even Flow.  The rest is a bit--underwritten, overambitious, not so great.  But those four songs...<br />It was on Vs. that Pearl Jam really showed they were something not to be messed with.  As opposed to Ten's less than energizing start, here we get slammed into place by two of PJ's still most timeless rockers &quot;Go&quot; and &quot;Animal.&quot;  The yearning call of Vedder in &quot;Don't go on me&quot; is quickly turned to rejection in &quot;I'd rather be with an animal&quot;--but who cares when it rocks?  There's the middle section of &quot;WMA&quot; and &quot;Blood&quot; where these Seattle hard rock grunge gods get a bit of the--what's that word Mr. Clinton?--funk!  (Check Funkadelic's &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; for one of McCready's lost influences, possibly)  And do you want transcendence--and not that messy  feel good kind, or the kind the wallows one in eternal mires of sorrow-but true transcendence that sounds as though is been earned, wrought, lived for?  Check the one howl of &quot;I want you in my rearviewmirror&quot;--especially in the live versions.  <br />This is rock &amp; roll.  Textured, vibrant, alive, feeling, transcendant, happy, sad, conquering, rocking, passionate, loose, tight like no other band out of Seattle ever made.
B000051VWW|4.0|I became interested in popular music in 1963 and up until \\"Heart Of Glass\\" by Blondie I would never have considered buying a record by a female artist (OK Blondie was a male group with a female lead singer). However, on hearing \\"Smooth Operator\\" by Sade my musical taste began to change and without even knowing it my musical taste became feminised. <br />A few months ago I was reviewing what music I had purchased in 2000 and much to my surprise practical everything that had been added to my collection was by a female singer or a band fronted by a female (Sade, Jill Jones, Sugababes, Texas, Garbage, Erykah Badu, etc.) so it must be concluded that Sade has had a major impact on my life.<br />I was not aware that Sade had released a new album until I saw the most awful promotional video for her latest single on MTV ... as she is a very wealthy lady one would have expected much better, however I suspect that it is possible that the video cost a fortune and that some one lost the plot and did not appreciate the image that Sade needs to project. Unfortunately the song itself was a bit weak so I hesitated and did not purchase her latest album until early last week.<br />I was glad that I purchased the album and my advice is that you should not allow the video to influence your decision regarding the purchase of \\"Lovers Rock\\". I really enjoyed most if not all of the content but to be honest I must admit that one cannot claim that Sade has progressed musically over the years.<br />As \\"Lovers Rock\\" is excellent compared with what is currently available (there is not much competition at this level) and because I really like Sade I was tempted to give this CD 5 stars but this would not be fair to anyone who is looking for \\"best of breed\\" ... if you do not already have a Sade album you should really consider getting one of her earlier releases however  \\"Lovers Rock\\" would not be a bad addition to any library. So what I am really saying is that this would be rated a 4 star CD relative to her other releases which would be rated 5 star or better. <br />If you are already a Sade fan you will not be disappointed but neither will you be fully satisfied as the musical content is really best described as being \\"more of the same\\". <br />I suspect that Sade was a bit lazy (this might also explain the video) knowing full well that anything she produced would sell by the bucket load especially to a mature audience but one cannot fool all of the people all of the time and if her next offering shows the same lack of imagination and artistic progress her career as a singer will enter its terminal stage very rapidly.<br />Note to North American readers: As I am Irish you will find my spelling and use of language a bit unusual but I really do hope that this review was helpful.
0553573403|5.0|I discovered &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; while prowling Amazon.com's fantasy section for my next read, and the reviews were spectacular. It was not long before I had purchased it and was giving it a go. From the very first page I was in a trance, and by the end of the Prologue alone I was hopelessly hooked.<br />George R. R. Martin has an undeniable talent with words, and he has all the goods to put this talent to use with an original and compelling plotline. It's a crime how well the man can write (he should be forced to take the Black). You add believable, admirable, and oft times despicable characters and a living, breathing, highly fascinating world, and you have all the makings of a classic. And this, my friends, is a classic. The genre has not seen its like in years.<br />Martin's innovations are evident even in the structure of the novel's chapters. Each is named after the respective character it follows, and when the chapter ends as many as a hundred pages could go by before you read about that character again, leaving you in a state of anticipation and suspense. Fortunately, all of these characters are interesting and their stories varied. The only downside I found was in the case of Jon Snow (my personal favorite); each time a chapter entitled &quot;Jon&quot; comes to an end, I find myself groaning in agony and impatient for the next. But there is naught to fear, for almost every chapter in between is sure to be compelling as well.<br />&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; is rich with a sense of foreboding and dread, and Martin has a way of making mundane things seem eerie, even ominous. In this way it is somewhat reminiscent of Robert Jordan's &quot;Eye of the World,&quot; yet vastly superior. No character is safe; not even the one you love most. Death in the Seven Kingdoms is a permanent thing (at least south of the Wall), and it visits frequently. &quot;The gods are cruel...&quot;<br />Of all the books I have read in recent times, I recommend none more highly than &quot;A Game of Thrones.&quot; It is a shot in the arm for the fantasy genre. It is by no means a light-hearted tale, but has the bittersweet flavor of dark fantasy in a setting that is remarkably &quot;gloom and doom.&quot; It is graphic at times, even a little disconcerting, but that's all in the brilliant design, and none of it seems out of place in the setting of the Seven Kingdoms. It is an emotional journey for the characters as well as the reader, and I long for the next installations.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Even though it does seem to borrow from Braveheart quite a bit, Gladiator still stands on its own as one of the best movies of 2000.<br />Either you like this kind of movie or you don't, so I'll mention what's great about the DVD itself. DreamWorks has outdone themselves again. Not only do you get Dolby Digital, but you also get DTS on the same disc! In the past everyone has said that &quot;You can't put both on the same disc! There'll be no room for any extras!&quot; And they would be right. So DreamWorks piled all the extras, and there are a lot of them, onto a second disc, in an innovative package that is the same size as a single disc box.<br />The extras disc is packed! Deleted scenes, storyboards, a making-of documentary, some gladiator history, a feature on the score, stills, a &quot;diary&quot; written by the young actor who plays Lucius, and much, much more!<br />All I can say is that if you've made it this far, you will love this movie!
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is probably the best CD I have ever heard.  It is a perfect blend of metal, rap, singing, and sreaming.  Here is a review of each song.<br />Papercut - Probably the best opener I have ever heard.  Has great rapping and sreaming in the first half, and then it gets really emotional in the end.<br />One step closer - An exellant all singing song with awsome guitars and vocals.  Near the end it gets really cool when Chester starts yelling &quot;Shut up when I'm talking to you&quot;!<br />With you - Another exellant rap rock song with a good DJ part in the middle.<br />Points of athourity - Has a great rap opening and then singing with heavy guitars.  One of my favorites.<br />Crawling - Very emotional with pure singing and lots of bass.<br />Runaway - Another one of my favorites that blends strong emotional singing with mad yelling and guitars.<br />By myself - Starts out very heavy and then gets a little softer.  Probably the heaviest track.<br />In the end - Another exellant pure singing song that demonstrates how good a band Linkin Park is.<br />A place for my head - My favorite track.  The guitars riff in this song is a masterpiece and the rapping, singing, and sreaming is at its best on this track.<br />Forgotten - Starts out very heavy than gets extremly emotional.  Great rapping too.<br />Cure for the itch - Although it is a DJ song, it is very good compared to the other DJ songs I have heard.<br />Pushing me away - The last song on this album yet again has mainly all singing.  It is very emotional too witch is good for a final track.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I think that I've listened to this cd sO much that it's gotten old for even a classic.  The Chili Peppers definitely rock though, from mellow title song Californication to loud and toony All Around the World, each song has its own uniqueness that only the Peppers could produce. Be sure to listen to the not-so-well-known songs at the end of the CD; they deserve nearly as much credit as the first ones.  If you're not humming the songs after listening to this cd there is something wrong with you.  ROCK On PEPPERS!

Vintage Detroit Rock !

B00000J6AG|1.0|this is a commercialized ambient album suited for a soundtrack.  i couldn't see someone wearing headphones and having a listen to &quot;play&quot;.  however this lackluster sound of moby's, complements the products it provides a soundtrack to, rather well.  <br />with little phonic creativity and a lot of factory-setting sound, i suggest you do not play &quot;play&quot;.  press stop then eject.
630469654X|4.0|I love this movie and I would call it timeless, I would have given it a 5 rating except that the music really really dates it.  It echos with the distinctly 80's synthesizer sound and it just does not work within a medievil format. Otherwise this movie is fantastic, it has a timeless theme, great acting, Broderick is his usual self, fun, funny and all around excellent.
B000002U82|5.0|A musical masterpiece, and ground breaking work for the group!  Until this album, Pink Floyd was really nothing, and this was the one that put them on the charts, for over 15 years to be exact.  Keep in mind that this album has sold over 25 million copies, and ranks in the top 5 of all time.  The instrumental tracks lead in perfectly with the vocal ones, creating a complete audio picture for the listener to hear.  Buy it, and treasure it always.
B000001GQB|5.0|I agree with virtually all of the reviewers below. All six symphonies are conducted and played with the kind of gusto and fervor they demand, and the fact that they're old recordings(but successfully re-mastered)and &quot;traditional&quot; interpretations doesn't matter one iota. For me the greatest successes are 35 through to 39. If anyone ever doubted that 39 belongs with Mozart's final two symphonies in terms of greatness, then let Bohm's interpretation of it carry you away. Marvellous stuff. The 40th is done perfectly, but I actually prefer MacKerras's version of the 41st, since he really grabs the opening bars by the throat, whereas Bohm is a little more restrained. That's a very minor reservation on my part though, and the MacKerras recordings are still full price and no doubt will be for some time. <br />Most importantly, I think this is the only recording of consequence where you can listen to the last three symphonies--miraculous masterpieces all--on one CD, in their entirety, without any interruption. This recording has also made me appreciate the &quot;Haffner,&quot; &quot;Prague,&quot; and &quot;Linz&quot; symphonies more than I ever did before, mostly because they're usually portioned off and coupled with one of the last three and they suffer by comparison. Here though, they're all together chronologically, and so you can really see Mozart's development clearly and with a great deal of pleasure and appreciation. It'd be nice if DG did one more of these Bohm compilations of Mozart symphonies, taking in the high points of his earlier symphonies, like 25, 28 and 29. In the meantime though, this will do just fine.
076790382X|3.0|Having a job that requires me to live overseas, yet always being an American at heart, I was intrigued by the title of this book, and the possibility that it would offer some unique reflection of an American returned home after 20 years away in a humorous, yet reflective manner.<br />Well, let's be frank, the book is not reflective.  That is apparently not its purpose.  If you're looking for thought, skip the book.<br />Next, to the humor.  I did find myself laughing out loud at a few of the essays, extremely well-written, and containing some hilarious passages about the peculiarities of my compatriots!  Unfortunately, though, Bryson's humor for the most part is of the &quot;old grouch on a park bench complaining&quot; variety, and his writing starts to become wearying as you go deeper and deeper into the book.  I am almost finished, and well, I can't wait for it to end, because each essay seems the same as the previous one.<br />I believe there are at least two if not more essays in the book of how difficult computers are to operate, for example.  Well, I believe that &quot;humor&quot; went out of style in the early eighties.   There are several essays mimicking instruction manuals for technical gadgets, as well, which to be honest, I just skimmed because they were boring and full of ridiculous hyperbole.<br />The book works best when Bryson compares some new relevations he's witnessed, and compares those to his childhood, and/or his time in England.  I particularly remember his essay about taking the family to a drive-in movie!!  Makes you wonder how those things ever became popular!<br />I enjoyed reading an essay or two each morning, which kept things relatively fresh, but like I mentioned earlier, I'm at the end of the book, and the end can't come soon enough.  Overall, a cute enough book, but with flaws.

B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna, the mother of reinvention, does it again with her electro-funk dance hall &quot;Music&quot; collection.  Tracks such as the title track, Impressive Instant, Runaway Lover, and Dont Tell Me, make you want to turn the bass up on your stereo and start dancing.  Introspective ballads such as Nobody's Perfect, I Deserve It and Gone combine folk guitar, incredible melody with an electronic backdrop.  The ballad What It Feels Like For a Girl combines a feeling of feminist power with child like vulnerablity.  It also shows Britney and Christina who the original teen role model is.  Although tracks such as Amazing and Paradise dont hold up to the others, the disc as a whole is an excelent declaration of Madonna's rule of Dance Floor Pop.
B000051VWW|4.0|This is an album full of good B-sides, but don't we all want an album we toss in the CD and listen to in the background while reading a book or fixing a meal? This album maintains a consistent mellow and subtle mood. None of the tracks will irritate, disturb or otherwise intrude upon one's quiet mood. It's a great stress reliever.
B00004Y9PP|3.0|The first time I saw this movie I stepped in while my friends were watching it. I honestly thought it was one of those alien respawns like &quot;alien 3, or alien : ressurection&quot; or whatever they are. I really dont watch that much sci-fi because not much sci-fi is good. This movie was fully equipped with a bald chick, a group of crazy creatures and even an environment that was reminiscient of Alien.<br />I took it in stride though, and I actually started to like it. The action and suspense is good, and it was a bit of a touching ending. I would watch it a third time, but I doubt I would buy it. The replay value of a movie such as this is not large.<br />Go rent this movie. I wouldn't reccomend buying it until you at least see it.
B000056HE9|5.0|This movie will soon be the new &quot;Christmas Classic&quot; for all!  It's a great story about what is really important to us all.. family and friends.  Everyone should see this great movie!! Best movie I've seen and my all time favorite!
B00003CWL6|1.0|Perhaps because I heard so much hype, I may have expected more when I acquired the DVD.<br />I should have guessed when the Hollywood &quot;in&quot; crowd loves something this much, WATCH OUT.<br />Looks to me like those ever so pseudo &quot;hip&quot; self absorbed obnoxious inbred hollywood libs giving us their take on middle class america. Clinton and his Hollywood lapdogs obviously loved this movie. The basic equation here is to suggest middle america is so screwed up, so dysfunctional, that in relative terms, the Hollywood crowd must be just about normal.<br />Now isn't that convenient.

The Pact looks at the issues of parental relationships,suicide, peer relationships, homicide, and the coming of age in turbulent times.  <br />The Pact will evoke many emotions and challenge your morals.  You will grapple with the reality of physically losing a child through death and the possibility of losing a child through the court system.    <br />The Pact is a very gripping read, you won't be able to put it down. I would highly recommend this book! ~ Kelly
630575067X|1.0|Well, my heading says it all. `The Phantom Menace' is littered with faults in terms of acting, directing, scriptwriting, style and special effects, and is saved (if that term can be used in association with a lost cause) only by the blossoming talent of Natalie Portman, who has come a long way since `Leon'. Now before you start saying that I'm criticising the film only because I'm against Star Wars, I'll confess that, though not a huge fan, the original Star Wars (Episode IV) was a darned good yarn which had class (Alec Guinness), vitality (Harrison Ford/Mark Hamill), a truly great villain (James Earl Jones) and incredible special effects (the trench sequence still puts current-day imitations to shame). Episode I, on the contrary, feels like a lazy cash-in that was given no attention to detail, no thought and no effort from the writers, directors, producers or actors. As a result, without the success of Star Wars this film is nothing.<br />In terms of story, Episode I falls flat. Rather than being a movie, it is a `let's-fill-in-the-blanks-that-don't-need-filling-in' piece of filmmaking, and thus, rather than telling a story, it feels like an episode of a television show, Xena: Warrior Princess, for example. And, like television, the characters have no depth whatsoever and do not develop; at least Han, Luke and Leia had `issues', not to mention personalities. Furthermore, the special effects are diabolical. Yes, they are stunning at showing what computers are now capable of, but they DON'T LOOK REAL. At times you think it's a Pixar film, especially in the battle between the Gungans and the automated Federation soldiers, because the visuals could have been lifted from `A Bug's Life' or `Toy Story', which is bad when you consider that this is a live-action rather than animation film. Added to this, actors are frequently chroma-keyed into obviously computerised backgrounds, which are spotlessly clean, sterile, flat and unbelievably low-budget - whatever happened to building a set, small-scale modelling, linear rather than CGI animation? All it comes down to is that in the 1970's, with extremely limited computer technology, Lucasfilm was able to make a movie that looked and felt ten times more real than this one.<br />Overall, this is a disappointing beginning to what was touted as the most eagerly-anticipated film series of recent years. I (perhaps naively) thought that the film was about the guy in all the film-posters, Darth Maul, but his eight-or-so minutes of film time kind-of don't satisfy. And, looking forward to Ewan McGregor's proven acting talents, the only thing I was impressed by was his English accent. And, of course, there was that much-talked-about pod-racing sequence, which looked identical to the Playstation game, so that tells you precisely how realistic it was. I can only hope that Episode II is given a slightly larger budget, a hell-of-a-lot more effort, and stacks more of the creative flair that made Lucas his name all those years ago. This does not bode well for Indiana Jones 4!lding a set, small-scale modelling, linear rather than CGI animation?

0446310786|5.0|century. I first read this book when I was in the 7th grade and have returned to it numerous times during the intervening 39 years. It is a story of courage, heroism, and the loss of innocence of individuals, a culture, and a country. Set against the richly satisfying backdrop of the deep south in the early part of the twentieth century, is a story of man's inhumanity to man, and one man's struggle to do what is right against all odds. No syrupy sweetness here. No sense of the brave white man rescuing the poor, defenseless negro. This is a story of the dignity inherent in all men as they seek justice in one small corner of the world. This is must reading for all, preferably before highschool graduation. A slim volume, and deceptively easy to read, it reverberates to the core of one's being for years to come.
B0000524E5|5.0|I saw Coyote Ugly 25 times and enjoyed every time it was such a great movie I am looking forward to watching it on DVD and the bar scenes were really well done and the music was great throughout the movie and the acting was good and it had a good story to it as well
B00004TRD8|5.0|This DVD has three (count 'em, if you can!) films on it.  The original theater release version.  An ultimate edition version.  And THE EXTENDED SPECIAL EDITION version.  To get to see the latter you need a special code/procedure (shades of video-game code pounders!) to access such gems as: (1) what has got to be the ultimate Dolby Digital and THX lead-in to the opening credits of any DVD movie yet created for us mere mortals; (2) scenes of what the bad Terminator does in John Connor's room (in his foster-parent's home) early in the film; (3) graphic illustrations that the bad Terminator is becoming dysfunctional early on in the steel foundry towards the end of the film; and (4) an epilogue that definitively precludes future Terminator sequels.  Sound and video are &quot;reference quality&quot; for your home theater system which means, folks, it doesn't get any better than this!  Supplemental video material is copious and tied to which film version you have chosen to view.  The physical packaging is, well, truly unbelievable.  I'd recommend buying two copies: one to play with; and one as an investment--I'm NOT kidding.  Happy code hunting!
B000001A3H|5.0|This was my introduction to Kyuss, and it made me buy every album they made.  The vocals and guitar were good enough to keep me listening, but the drums and bass blew me away.  Their first one, Wretch, was raw but the songs were fluid and creative.  Sky Valley, the 3rd one, was epic and incredibly heavy.  Their fourth album, And the Circus Leaves Town, was good but lacked the cohesiveness and power of their previous albums.  If you're looking for a good introduction to this cult legend, start here.  This album will not disappoint, no matter what you like - the overall musicianship is incredible for every member of the band.    If you're a fan of QOTSA, I don't know what you'll think of Kyuss.  QOTSA is much more pop-oriented (I don't like most of their stuff - I found Kyuss on MTV's Headbanger's Ball).  Kyuss is a Led Zeppelin-esque mix of four awesome musicians at the top of their game.  If you like this, please check out Hermano's \\"Dare I Say\\".
B000002KB8|5.0|This is a great album, unquestionably.  I say album out of habit, as I'm 36 years old, so I've been around awhile and listened to many bands and owned many albums and CD's.  This still is as potent an album today as it was thirty years ago.  I first bought a tape of this back in 1979 or 1980 and was blown away by it.  Since then, I've upgraded to CD and still marvel at the music.<br />If you listen to this album, you can really hear the amazing influence Sabbath has on so much of the metal and alternative music to follow.  The intersting thing to me about this album is that while it's undeniably heavy, it has a jazz-like quality to many of the instrumental passages.  There are moments of real musicality here, not just mindless angry headbanging.  Of course there's plenty of amplified mayhem and doom to satisfy even the angriest metalhead, but it's truly, dare I say, sophisticated?<br />I've been listening to this album for over twenty years, and I still love it.
B0000074FL|5.0|This is a great CD..very underrated and sadly not in print in USA..I had to get this as an &quot;import&quot; from Germany...this band lineup is solid...the keyboard playing is great for the new sound they were exploring at the time...they really were onto something good with this sound..its different than previous releases and could only wonder how much they could have evolved ever further...John Sykes was a wise choice addition to the band...<br />Its consoling to know that Thin Lizzy with this lineup is touring in USA 2001 with John Sykes as vocals and he really DOES sing like Phil its scary (referring to the EXCELLENT One Night Only release-highly recommended)...thanks Thin Lizzy...you really are back in town...
0060977493|1.0|Well here is my honest opinion about this much touted tale of twins. This is basically a cute sort of kiddish story which sounds profound and arty because it is confusing. It took me quite an effort to complete it. All because half baked characters keep popping in and out of the book. Now what happens to them nobody really knows, and beyond a point u dont even care. Maybe the whole idea was to be arty by being confusing.....
6305205620|5.0|This double DVD set was recorded during a live performance in FT Worth, Texas and contains a fabulous set of songs from most of Metallica's released albums up to Re-load.  The performance took place on their newly designed stage and the lighting effects were captured well.  The camera spends equal time on all the members of the group and there is significant audience interaction.  Audio and video are above average for a live performance.  If you like hard rock and metal this DVD is essential.  It captures one of the most creative, enduring, and significant bands of our times.  <br />This DVD includes interviews, documentary, and behind-the scenes footage as well as different camera angles on certain songs.<br />Since the DVD is not censored you can experience the &quot;raw&quot; Hetfield.  But then I suspect those easily offended would in all likelihood not listen to Metallica - &quot;So What?&quot;
B00003CXFG|5.0|It's not entirely correct to call Pitch Black a sci-fi movie, but it certainly is in the same way as Alien. From a technical point of view, Pitch Black has many original ideas to pull it away from the cheap slasher type. Sometimes it seems kind of  hard to catch up, for it is somewhat bumpy in storytelling but not full of mistakes. The quick cuts to different scenes make the film quite short-wave. Action is always an difficult element and though it's not the quintessence of the movie, it's perfectly realized and even comes up with a few surprises. Visually the movie is just great, the difference between day and day, the black night and Tatopoulos' beautiful creatures ensure great popcorn entertainment. The great DTS Surround Sound creates a fantastic atmosphere, especialy at the planets night. One last thing, Vin Diesel ist absolutely great.
B000001ESP|5.0|This album followed the footsteps of Permanent Waves but improved upon it in almost every aspect.  The songwriting is tighter and more memorable; the first four songs are AOR staples to this day.  &quot;Red Barchetta&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Yyz&quot; stand out in particular.  While these four are great songs (though perhaps suffering from oversaturation on the airwaves), the second half of the album is equally strong and maybe has longer-lasting appeal.  The epic &quot;Camera Eye&quot; is great, as is &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; and the new-wave influenced &quot;Vital Signs&quot;.  If you're going to like anything by Rush, this is the place to start.
B00004YA66|5.0|&quot;Frequency&quot; kept me on the edge of my seat.  The movie is a wild story that keeps you thinking &quot;Where is this gonna go next?&quot;.  The movie twists and turns and keeps the watcher waiting in suspence until the very end.  Mets fans will definitely appreciate this movie, especially the fans who were around to see the 1969 World Series.  The writers of this script are very creative and I can't imagine coming up with this plot.  All I have to say is watch it.<br />The DVD is good; it offers the theatrical trailer and deleted scenes and a full length commentary by the director.  It also includes a facts feature.  Very good movie, very good DVD.
B000003TAR|5.0|i think maybe it is the rawness of the musical style of several of the songs on this CD that makes some people love it and some people rate it lower than nevermind. personally i like this one better, although i dont think it is necessarily more powerful- it just depends on whether or not you like wailing, sawing at guitars, and growling. i know that sounds like, &quot;well who the hell WOULd want to listen to something described like that?&quot;, but the songwriting is excellent and the key is, there is actually a MELODY to these songs- it isnt just mindless thrashing.  despite the EXTREMELY pure-grunge sound on about half of of the tracks, this CD is not in my opinion, as angsty as Nevermind or any of nirvana's previously released albums for that matter. nevermind is much more candy and poppish, which is probably why it generally appeals to more people. i dont find this CD necessarily more sincere than their others, but unlike the others, it seems to have a point. that is, the lyrics mean something, and they all kind of have to do with each other- it's less like individual songs.  people on here have listed the songs they liked off of the album. well, i love them all. i dont think any of them are more beautiful than the others- just more catchy maybe, radio-accessible, whatever, in some cases. this is an amazing album by one of the most talented bands in the past 5 decades. if you dont like it, oh well.  and i just have to throw this in, because it annoys the crap out of me: people are way too damn obsessed with the life story of nirvana. who gives a crap about kurt cobain? the music is all that matters. by the way,dont be misled, &quot;radio friendly unit shifter&quot; is a great song. you just have to listen to it until the bridge, which is awesome and the high point of the song (in lyrics and musically). alright. thank you for reading this crap. i hope you buy this album and like it.
B00004SCX6|4.0|When I started to listen to my little sister's copy of this CD, I expected the typical trio of catchy bubble gum songs and a bunch of not so great &quot;fillers&quot;. I was pleasently surprise! Although songs like &quot;stronger&quot; and &quot;baby, what you see is what you get&quot; all carry familiar tones, every song on the CD is fun, catchy, and interesting to listen to. Who buys a britney spears CD to listen to her voice? It's the infectious tune and pop-inspired lyrics that are fun to listen to! Regardless of her voice or her talent, this CD is catchy and original...I look forward to seeing which songs becomee hit singles.
630305904X|4.0|First let it be said that while I love the film Orlando it is simply impossible to get all the themes and events of the novel into one movie, so I strongly urge all viewers, whether they loved or hated this movie, to read the book, Virginia Woolf's unique love letter to Vita Sackville-West.<br />The inevitable failings involved in translating a book into a film aside, 'Orlando' is visually exsquisite, the costumes and locations sumptuous and splendid, fully evoking the decadance and contrasting squalor of the centuries in which Orlando lives his/her life. The score perfectly compliments the surroundings, the atmosphere and the themes of each scene, and is beautifully composed and performed.<br />Though some have expressed doubts over Tilda Swinton's ability to play Orlando, the aristocrat born as man who turns into a woman half way through his/her life, I thought she was the perfect choice. I believe knowing she is a woman initially taints people's ability to find her convincing as a man; to me she played the part with great charm, amiability and empathy, and became even more charming as a woman - the character of Orlando at this stage in 'her' life becoming more rounded, more sympathetic, more knowledgable and Swinton captures that well.  <br />This film does not follow the 'rules' of the 'real' world - besides changing genders, Orlando lives for 400 years and does not age a day. It is the story of a pursuit for life, for meaning, by one individual determined to discover what that means. Accept it, and enjoy.<br />In its attempt to capture the most important of the book's events the film does have a slight recurring bump in continuity, it seems, and will no doubt be pretentious and boring to some, if not many. Nonetheless, Orlando is a sometimes humorous, sometimes haunting movie, thought provoking and richly realised.
0679879269|1.0|I think Pullman could have done a much better job in this series.  The first book was so interesting and engaging, with great characters, especially a strong female lead.  But book 2 and especially the new book 3, the Amber Spyglass, did not live up to what was begun in the Golden Compass.  Characters change from good to evil without decent explanations, and important plot developments from book one are tritely dismissed with a phrase such as &quot;I lied,&quot; because Pullman cannot come up with a good explanation.  On a separate note, Pullman takes what could be an interesting exploration of different religious beliefs and simplifies it into shallow anti-catholic ravings.
B00000IAU3|3.0|I bought this CD after hearing &quot;Here With Me&quot; and reading many positive reviews here on amazon. As someone who is a huge fan of many female singer-songwriters, Ms. Maclachlan in particular, I can only give this album 3 stars. Dido's voice is incredible, there is no doubt about that. But there are only one or maybe two other tracks as good as the first one. The album is very &quot;poppy&quot;, although I have no specific complaints about that, but the songs are NO WAY musically/lyrically comparable to tracks on a Sarah Maclachlan or Fiona Apple album (both of whom she has been likened to here on amazon). However this artist is clearly very talented and I would hope she would mature some on her next outing--if so, I will be first in line to buy it.
0684872153|5.0|This is a story of how Francis McCourt lived and survived through the bleakness of his childhood, with a drunkard for a father.  Although the beginning of the book is very depressing, with the death of Frank's baby sister, followed by the deaths of his younger twin brothers, many parts of the books still have numerous funny recounts.  I found myself smiling and even laughing throughout the book!<br />The memoir is written from the view of Frank McCourt as a child.  It is a wonder that the kid has not gone into depression in such a harsh environment.  He even had dreams of going to America and earning big bucks, which many had tried to convince him to forget.  Despite this, Frank is still one determined person to succeed.<br />The only thing that I dislike about the book is the lack of proper punctuation and sometimes spelling.  In whole, the book is still readable and understandable.  As this a such a superb book, this lacking can be easily overlooked once the reader is into the book.<br />A book for all! (Except those who could not bear bleakness and discrimmation of any sort)
020161622X|5.0|There are hundreds of books out there about computing - most of them so dry that reading them is like reading a dictionary, and about as narrow in scope as the manual that came with my lawnmower.  Those other books usually expouse a shallow perpsective that has one answer for everything - one answer that truly works for almost nothing.  This book is radically different.<br />Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas bring strong professional histories and a sparkling style to their book.  This makes for a unique viewpoint on computing - a holistic one, where there isn't one pat, tired answer, but instead there's a rich, tested philosophy.  They value pragmatism, as you might expect from the title - and that pragmatism is woven with a diverse and sometimes surprising set of very practical &quot;tips&quot;.  Unlike other &quot;philosophical&quot; works, this one has just the right amount of granularity - enough detail that the reader is sure to &quot;get it&quot;, but not so much as to prescribe a specific coding solution.  The authors respect their audience more than that.<br />On top of the richness of the content, the very best thing about this book is the sheer fun of reading it.  They have a fantastic sense of humor, and a clever, breezy style.  I laughed out loud more than once reading this book, and smiled most of the rest of the time.<br />This book has gotten rave reviews here and on other sites (slashdot, Dr. Dobbs, etc.).  It is no wonder.  The only bad review I've noticed made me seriously wonder if the reviewer had even opened the book.  He suggested that Hunt and Thomas are too stuck on the tired benefits of up-front design.  Nothing could be more incorrect.  In fact, one of their strong philosophical tenets is built on refactoring - redesigning as you go, when needed, and letting design be &quot;good enough&quot;.  I seriously doubt that reviewer ever read this book - he certainly missed a great deal of its content.<br />I'd have to agree with the vast majority of reviewers on this one - Pragmatic Programmer is already becoming a classic, and that honor is well deserved for a book which bestows a great deal of honor on this profession.  Buy it - and actually READ it.reviewers on this one - Pragmatic Programmer is already becoming a classic, and that honor is well deserved for a book which bestows a great deal of honor on this profession.

0440234743|5.0|This is the first book I've ever read of John Grisham, therefore I can not compare this to his other bestselling novels. But I can say this, I could not put this down once I started reading it. The characters were very real and I found myself rooting for Nate throughout the story to overcome his problems.  Another great part of this book is that is opened up a whole new world to me in the explanation of the Pantanal, an ecological region of Brazil that I had never heard of before. Thanks John, you just got yourself a new fan.
0684853523|4.0|A revealing, entertaining, compassionate and useful book from Stephen King. King &quot;talks&quot; about his earliest memories of writing, some incidents which shaped who he is, and then sets about to explain what he believes are the most important rules one needs to be a good writer.<br />You'll notice I used the word `talks' above.  It's because that is what Stephen King seems to be doing.  He is writing in an almost conversational voice.  A voice that is  genuine, warm and honest.  The book is short and will take you perhaps 6 or 8 hours max to read.  It is like having a very long cup of coffee with Stephen King and listening to him reminisce.  He had finished more than half of it before he was hit and nearly killed by the Van.  I'm glad he completed the book and published it.  It's probably the smallest book he's written and while some might dismiss it as nothing particularly essential, I strongly disagree.<br />If you've curious about how King's mind work, some of his personal struggles, his thoughts on what he does for a living and what he has read in the last few years, this book will tell you a lot. The manner in which he relates the stories is straight from the hip.  He swears perhaps a little too much, but that's who he is.  His candor is refreshing because there's no doubt in my mind he's being honest as he possibly dares (in print).  Oh you won't get all the little details about his family life... but you will get some.  He still protects his privacy to some extent, but he shares his humanity and compassion without having to hide behind some invented character's guise to do so.<br />He relates his struggles as a writer trying to make a name for itself in the first half of the book.  He tells us the story about how he had the idea for Carrie, wrote the book, got frustrated with the book and threw it away.  His wife Tabitha retrieved it, liked it and almost demand he continue working on it.<br />=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />&quot;My wife made a crucial difference during those two years I spent teaching Hampden (and washing sheets at New Franklin Laundry during the summer vacation).  If she had suggested that the time I spent writing stories on the front port of our rented house on Pond Street or in the laundry room of our rented trailed on Klatt Road in Hermon was wasted time, I think a lot of the heart would have gone out of me.  Tabby never voiced a single doubt, however.  Her support was a constant, one of the few good things I could take as a given.  And whenever I see a first novel dedicated to a wife (or a husband), I smile and think, `There's someone who knows'.  Writing is a lonely job. Having someone who believes in you makes a lot of difference.  They don't have to make speeches.  Just believing is usually enough.&quot;<br />He talks about his alcoholism:<br />&quot;Alcoholics build defenses like the Dutch build dikes.  I spent the first 12 years or so of my married life assuring myself that I just `liked to drink'.  I also employed the world famous Hemingway Defense . . . . : as a writer I am a very sensitive fellow, but I am also a man and real men don't give in to their sensitivities.  Only sissy men do that.  Therefore I drink.&quot;<br /> A little later he writes:<br />&quot;The idea the creative endeavor and mind altering substances are entwined is one of the great pop-intellectual myths of our time.  The four twentieth century writes whose work is most responsible for it are probably Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Sherwood Anderson, and the poet Dylan Thomas.<br />Substance abusing writers are just substance abusers--common garden variety drunks and druggies, in other words.<br />Any claims that the drugs and alcohol are necessary to dull a finer sensibility are just the usual self serving bul*shitt.  I've heard alcoholic snowplow drivers make the same claim, that they drink to still the demons.  It doesn't matter if your James Jones, John Cheever or a stewbum snoozing in Penn Station; for an addict, the right to the drink or drug of choice must be preserved at all costs.  Hemingway and Firzgerald didn't drink because they were creative, alienated or morally weak.  They drank because it's what alkis are wired up to do. Creative people probably do run a greater risk of alcoholism and addiction than those in some other jobs, but so what?  We all look pretty much the same when we're puking in the gutter.&quot;<br />=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />None of it is earth-shattering stuff.  None of it is new and it's probably not anything you haven't heard or thought about before.  However, coming from Stephen King in this manner there is a weighted poignancy in the words and there is a great value in listening to one of the most successful writers in history, ruminate on a variety of personal subjects. I found myself mostly agreeing with his opinions, but even if you don't, there's value in understanding where he is coming from.  There's also a genuine warmth and affection that comes through.<br />About a third of the book is King sharing some lessons he's learned about the mechanics of writing.  Rules he's decided to follow in regards to how he writes and advice to writers who aren't Stephen King.  He includes a list at the end of the book of what he's read the last few years-- interesting list.

A third of the book is personal opinions on a wide array of subjects from writers to editors to drugs and alcohol to having a support person or group with you etc. etc.  A third of the book concerns the nuts and bolts of writing. I hesitate to call the book a mini-workshop, or even a seminar, because it's neither narrowly focused  nor strictly useful and informative advice on writing.<br />The portion of the book which tackles topics from setting up a space for writing, to grammar dos and don'ts to work habits etc isn't likely to be of much interest to non-writers (who aren't likely to purchase a book titled: On Writing anyway), but struggling and beginning (and just for fun)writers should fine much of value here.

But I can say this, I could not put this down once I started reading it. The characters were very real and I found myself rooting for Nate throughout the story to overcome his problems.  Another great part of this book is that is opened up a whole new world to me in the explanation of the Pantanal, and ecological region of Brazil that I had never heard of before. Thanks John, you just got yourself a new fan.
B000002VSN|5.0|How can you go wrong with Whitney Houston and the Georgia Mass Choir? Or with Whitney Houston and the first lady of gospel Shirley Ceasar? As a former choir member, I love the genre. And while I never sounded nearly as good as these folks, this CD brought back fond memories of standing in the choir loft on Sunday mornings. She has said that during the filming of the movie, she always sang live because &quot;You don't lip synch with the Georgia Mass Choir.&quot; It's a real treat to see those performances. Whitney makes you feel all of these songs, but my favorites are &quot;Joy&quot; and &quot;I Love the Lord&quot; which was praised by the New York Times as the most virtuoso vocal performance of that year. I will admit that I am not objective because I am a huge Whitney Houston fan. Personal problems aside, this is one flawless singer who had been blessed with excellent pipes.<br />I thought it was cute that when a previous reviewer mentioned that her daughter wanted to know why Whitney and the choir were singing about rocks in one of the selections. And I agree that this music can touch anyone. That's the beauty of gospel music,  and I'm not talking about that watered down Kirk Franklin stuff either. This is that down-home, old school gospel music. The music of our parents and grandparents. The duet with Shirley Ceasar, He's All Over Me, is a classic gospel workout.<br />I remember the year that Whitney boycotted an awards show because this CD wasn't considered for honors in the gospel category, but it can actually be put into many categories -- gospel, seasonal, soundtrack. There are some R&amp;B tracks including a remake of I Believe in You and Me and Step by Step, but I bought this CD for the gospel tracks. I would love to hear Whitney do an entire album of hymns or standards.
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd is so awesome.  It has some great lyrics and it's all clean.  That's what's so great.  They show you don't have to cuss to make awesome music, like Limp Bizkit.  Definitely get this cd.
0385474547|5.0|This book is very rich in culture, Ibo culture or just African culture. It is a book about [Ogbuefi] Okonkwo, a renowned young elder in the village of Umuofia, just before the brink of British colonialism and export-Christian indoctrination to the &quot;Empire&quot; in the second half of the 19th century. It is a book about an African society for which oral tradition, tribal culture and ritual were very meaningful. A society in which there was no established &quot;chief&quot; and yet with an unwritten order of rank and file among the tribesmen and their women, made to function &quot;smoothly&quot; through a complicated network of elders and fellow tribesmen with &quot;tribal ties&quot; and &quot;ties of tribal  blood&quot; to each other. There were conflicts and inter-tribal war, but so also was there peace. There was ritual murder, contact to the Spirit World and ghosts were alive. Everyone outside the village and who didn't belong to the tribe was a &quot;foreigner&quot; and journeying out of Umuofia was called &quot;going abroad&quot;. Elders met frequently to exercise their oratory powers of Ibo speech and parables and even to &quot;gossip&quot; about the customs of some of their neighbours, villages nearby. I remember an interesting portion of the book where all the elders talk about the weaknesses of their neighbours' traditions and then they all marvel as one of them informs them: <br />&quot;.. and have you heard? In certain cultures, the family's children belong to the wife and not the husband!&quot; ... And then they all laugh as one of them answers:&quot;.. you might as well say that, in those cultures, the woman lies on top of the man when they are making the children!..&quot; [Laughter]<br />The book is full of ibo parables, idiomatic sayings and African fables of spirits and the power of magic and wizardry. There is a fable about one &quot;Nnandi&quot;, alone in the forest who was always &quot;cooking and eating&quot;, with rain falling and the sun shining.  <br />Okonkwo is a big, strong and powerful man. He is also a wrestler and about the only one who ever floored the renowned &quot;Amalinze The Cat&quot;. Okonkwo is an interesting personality who loathes anything to do with weakness and cowardice; for that is why he has no kind memories of his own father, a lazy ne'ver-do-well as he sees him. He is a successful and rich man with 3 wives, whose fields are always ploughed, his barns full and is very respected in the village of Umuofia and &quot;abroad&quot; as a courageous warrior in war. He was the first many times to bring back chopped-off heads of enemies from war! He is one giant of a man and rules his household with a heavy iron hand. His own kids are afraid of him. His wives are afraid of him. He is a domestic dictator who can growl like a lazy lion about anything anytime he chooses, though not always without reason! He actually lives in fear of failure and losing honour and place in his society, that is why he is so hard and really scared. He lives in fear of resembling his weak father.<br />Okonkwo's tragedy begins with his own eldest son, Nwoye, in whom he sees a mirror-image of his lazy father. Perhaps to fill in for this vacuum, he takes a particular liking for Ikemefuna, his &quot;adoptive&quot; son. The tragedy intensifies when the &quot;Oracle Of The Hills And Caves&quot; -- a spirit medium -- decrees that Okonkwo slaughter his son for sacrifice in a religious, tribal ritual. Because he doesn't want to be branded or seen by others as a coward, he does it, though with a heavy heart. Ikemefuna is killed. The consequences of this ritual killing make him banned for, I think, &quot;seven rains and seven harvests&quot; - something like seven years.<br />When Okonkwo returns to Umuofia, he finds that things have drastically changed and that there are white men manning things and attempting to run everything. There are missionaries on the scene proclaiming a new religion, saying there is only one one God,who once sent His son to die for everyone's sins. At this, I remember one in a gathered audience answering back very seriously at the translator and his preaching white man: <br />&quot; Wait a moment! You say God has a son, who is his wife then?&quot;<br />Okonkwo finds many Umuofians - including his own eldest son -- converting to Christianity and this burns him with anger. Nevertheless, he remains &quot;distant&quot; in his approach to these alien influences -- or to those driving them -- until the day of confrontation comes, when a forbidden meeting takes place and all the men of Umuofia meet to discuss the strange culture &quot;invading&quot; their village. A non-Umuofian black messenger of the white man -- sent by the white man to inform the gathered armed men of Umuofia to disperse -- answers Okonkwo, who had jumped forward and asked him with contempt what he wanted there,:<br />&quot; This meeting is illegal. The white man, whose power you know too well, has ordered it to stop!&quot; <br />At that moment, Okonkwo, burning with anger and hatred, drew his machete in a flash and used it and slew the white man's messenger, cut off the messenger's head from its uniformed body. But then Okonkwo -- fearful of the powerful white man's vengeance and revenge -- disappears and soon hangs himself with a rope. As a suicide case, cutting his body down was a traditional taboo, for whoever did it without performing a medicineman's ritual was surely bound to face the wrath of the vengeful tribal spirits. Who was gonna cut him down from that rope now? The other elders and his friends gathered and discussed ...<br />And yet the author sympathetically portrays Okonkwo as a strong and prototypical African tribesman with his own manly problems and excesses of that age -- a heroic warrior who has no war to fight and is more at war with himself. <br />Professor Achebe's books are all very good and I think I've read most of them. They are historical [even a little prophetic, like &quot;A Man Of The People&quot; published just before Nigerian's first military coup -- I think -- in January 1966]. His books chronicle the different stages of change in his Ibo society -- but also in Nigeria and Africa, as a whole -- through the last 100 and more years. In this regard, this story of Okonkwo's tragedy at the time of the European partition of Africa is continued in Professor Achebe's second book, &quot;No Longer At Ease&quot;, which tells the modern-day &quot;good life&quot; and easy survival of Obi Okonkwo, Okonkwo's intelligent, principled, &quot;bourgeois&quot; and well-educated grandson living at the brink of Nigeria's independence as a middle-class, well-paid civil servant. There were very, very few of his kind: black, well-educated, &quot;been-to&quot;, owning a car, etc. But then the sad fall! An intellectual young man's tragedy! It would be helpful to read this book, too.<br />Thumbs up to all of Prof. Achebe's books[!] I have been reading them from the time I was 13 [and that's more than a decade ago now]! Interesting! This is real &quot;African&quot; literature!! I guarantee you!!!
B000004286|5.0|The film is gory, I know (still, it's one of my favourites) but the music is exquisite. James Horner is indubitably one of the best composers in the business, second only to the venerable John Williams. He captures the passion, the pain, the spirit of the film. The Gaelic tones that show up in all of his music (take Titanic, for example) are perfectly crafted in this soundtrack. The result is sheer, piercing beauty.
B0000039QA|2.0|Not since Sid Vicious bought the myth and karked it in the Chelsea Hotel has pop culture's lust for verisimilitude attained such heights. Consider the feud between East Coast and West Coast hardcore rap acts. Like punk, it is on the surface a laughable boy-gang game of foul-mouthed come-uppance. But when major players like Tupac and B.I.G. eat lead within months of each other, it becomes clear that we're dealing with something altogether more serious. Or is that altogether more ridiculous?<br />B.I.G.'s posthumous album is called Life After Death and it's filled with references to you know what. The cover shows the big guy posing next to a hearse, and it even has an intro that puts a nice Young And The Restless spin on his flatline status.<br />So, how to consider?<br />When sociology and music blur, assessing the music seems an arbitrary waste. Someone somewhere is mouthing the words &quot;life imitates art&quot;, while lots of middle-class white kids with disposable income to pay for double CDs send this into the American charts at No. 1. Gratuitous voyeurism, or musical appreciation?<br />&quot;I gotta talk about my life,&quot; sez Biggie. That the man is no exceptional talent doesn't seem to matter. That one is soon blunted to the obscenity, violence, misogyny and homophobia doesn't matter either. What matters, as noted on &quot;Last Day&quot;, is that someone's &quot;playin' Monopoly with real cash.&quot;<br />B.I.G. has the fix on his attraction. On the schmoozy, R&amp;B-type numbers you're being impressed by the Rose Royce synth and slick crossover potential, when our hefty Lothario mouths the refrain: &quot;I'm f.cking you tonight.&quot; Like, smmmoooooooth, baby. And how about something like &quot;voice of the urban black underclass&quot; while we're at it?<br />Overblown, Life After Death sounds like an hour-plus attack of the terrible twos and provides the same empty junk-food satiation as real life television. Avoid?
B00004T9UF|2.0|Eminem had to struggle in his life, I'll agree with that after viewing EMtv and other documentaries about him... and I like that he's expressing how he feels...<br />However, this album, in my opinion, was overated terribly.  It is a decent album, but the hype surrounding it is trying to make this release seem like it was the best CD ever released in 50 years...<br />...<br />The #1 reason to why I am not supporting eminem anymore is that he is out of ideas... he's out of ideas....<br />The good tracks on the cd were: &quot;Stan&quot; , &quot;Whoever Knew&quot; , &quot;Real Slim Shady&quot; (even though everyones sick of it) , &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot; , and &quot;Kim&quot; even though that is sadistic and morally no one should like that :-)<br />but the rest of the cd is self centered topics or just any lyrics slopped together and made into a song... &quot;I Am&quot; , &quot;B*tch Please part 2&quot; , &quot;Kill You&quot; , and the rest of the cd...<br />If eminem joined with Rawkus or another underground label...he wouldn't be as popular but he would be a better artist...<br />...  Eminem is one of the most talented MCs out today.  He can rap over practically any beat, speed it up or slow it down, whatever.  Listen to this album and you will realize he can lay down lyrics over anything and it will sound like they were meant to be together.  BUY THIS ALBUM, BUT DONT LET IT BABYSIT YOUR KIDS. nuff said. l realize he  can lay down lyrics over anything and it will sound like they were meant to  be together.  BUY THIS ALBUM, BUT DONT LET IT BABYSIT YOUR KIDS. nuff said.
0440219078|5.0|HEY, A FIVE STAR!! I read this for the first time in my Language Arts class when I was in sixth grade. Then I read it again in seventh grade, and it was still a great book.<br />I like Lois Lowry's idea of a futuristic community and how she chose her characters in a some kind of fashion that relates to the conclusion in some way. I really recommend this book to everyone!!
B00001IVOF|4.0|The Mobb's 3rd release may take a couple listens to fully appreciate, especially considering it was the follow-up to the certified classic &quot;The Infamous.&quot; But make no mistake about it, &quot;Hell On Earth&quot; is one of the darkest, grimiest albums ever. Havoc does an amazing job behind the boards (and on the mic), while P spits street tales like only he can.<br />The album kicks off with &quot;Animal Instinct,&quot; which sets the tone nicely for the rest of the album. The cuts that follow, &quot;Drop A Gem On Em,&quot; &quot;Bloodsport,&quot; and &quot;Extortion&quot; (featuring Method Man), are all classics, which will have you noddin your head and hittin rewind, as will just about every other track on here. Raekwon stops by on the bangin &quot;Nighttime Vultures.&quot; And who can forget the classic title track? It ranks right up there with other Mobb classics such as &quot;Shook Ones&quot; and &quot;Quiet Storm.&quot;<br />While the majority of this album is bangin, there are a couple mishaps such as &quot;Still Shinin,&quot; which really don't hit hard. But when there's so much other solid material, these mishaps can be easily overlooked.<br />If you're into most of the bling-blingin hip-hop that's out there today, then this album is DEFINITELY NOT for you. But if you crave grimy, street-edged, hardcore hip-hop, this is an essential to your collection.
6301025083|4.0|This beautifully filmed story features an extremely charismatic performance by Marcello Mastroianni as Guido, an Italian director with a really cool hat and glasses combo but no idea about how to bring his next movie together. As the pressures of of the production bear in on him, he retreats first to a spa, and then into his fantasies, most of which involve women.<br />The whole thing is a collection of amazing scenes. If only there weren't so many actresses and mistresses and wives, they all run together -- especially when it seems that most of the scenes are filmed with improvised dialogue. The video release contains white-on-white subtitling, so that just makes things even more confusing.
B000002B1M|4.0|It was just dumb that so many people expected Nas to produce another Illmatic with this album. Artists grow, and thus expand their subject matter. Unfortunately, this album got some bad reactions when it came out (and it still does), simply because it's not Illmatic part 2.<br />It Was Written is a great album from start to finish. &quot;The Message&quot; is just unbelievable: it ranks right up there as one of the greatest tracks of all time. &quot;Affirmative Action&quot; is another great track, showcasing Firm members Cormega, AZ, and Foxy Brown at their best. And on &quot;I Gave You Power,&quot; Nas uses a vivid metaphorical tale to describe how he's like a gun. Other standouts include &quot;Black Girl Lost,&quot; &quot;Street Dreams,&quot; &quot;Nas Is Coming,&quot; and of course the hit single &quot;If I Ruled The World.&quot;<br />The album falters on a couple tracks that don't really fit in well. But overall, this is a very solid 4 star album. If you haven't listened to it in a while, give it another chance. And if you still don't have it, well, buy it!
0688170528|5.0|The Pact is the first book of Jodi Picoult's that I have ever read, and based on what I've experienced with this, I know it won't be the last.  The Pact is emotional, moving, shocking and surprising.  The narrative is told in an interesting back-and-forth style, between Chris, who is accused of murdering his life long friend and love, and Emily, dead at seventeen and whose voice is a trace of past events.  Moving between present day court proceedings and what actually happened the night a teenaged girl was shot, we delve into the childhoods of both characters and the family that surrounds them.<br />The Hartes and the Golds live next to each other, eat together, gather in each others homes and go on vacation together.  Somewhere along the way, and much to the parents happiness, Chris and Emily end up dating each other.  Soon after, as witnessed in Emily's thoughts and journals, it becomes apparent that she herself is not happy with this;  that something in her life and heart is troubled beyond even Chris's presence.  The mystery surrounding the night of her death continues for the whole length of the novel, and every turn is shrouded in secrets, lies, and ultimately, the truth.<br />I devoured this book in a few sittings.  Picoult does a wonderful job in getting us to know the two families;  both sets of parents are equally interesting and sympathetic, and the story would not have worked as well if they weren't.  The reader never really knows what happened that fateful night between Emily and Chris until the very end, and it keeps you going to find out.  This is a well-written, intriguing novel, and I can't wait to read more of her works.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This is a great, fully loaded dvd. It has just about everything, including three different versions of the movie. If you've got a ps2, the way to get the third edition is that you have to enter each digit preceded by a zero--08,02,...and so on until you get the code in. The picture is great, as is the sound, and the extras will keep you entertained for hours, if not days.
1556154844|5.0|Code Complete has been in my &quot;Top 5&quot; books for programmers since I first read it many years ago.  It covers timeless topics such as coding techniques that many developers debate but unlike developer debates which can often degrade to a religious war, Steve's explanations are clear, lucid, very justified, and devote of ego.  <br />I could go on and on about why ever programmer should read this book, but please suffice it to say that if you haven't read this book, you don't have a right to an opinion on coding-related topics! (how's that for an unequivocal statement! :-)  After reading Code Complete you will have solid reasons for the coding constructs you choose. This will improve the quality of the code you produce by several times if not by and order of magnitude. <br />The only thing I wish for Code Complete is to see it updated.  Its examples are primarily in C and Fortran, and I wish it were updated using examples from languages such as Visual Basic, Java, Perl, Python, and C#.  Don't however think that this means it is not relevent if you don't program in C or Fortran; its concepts are timeless and language independent.<br />I thank Steve for writing this book, and I am even more thankful that he is such a skilled communicator.
B000002BUY|5.0|this album is wicked hard rock. the gutairs are really heavy and so is the singers voice. I thought that &quot;Make yourself&quot; was more mellow than this one. This one show pure rock and talent in their songs. I will review each song as I usually do.<br />1. Refdifine: AWESOME! Really heavy gutairs in this song. Good lyrics and vocals. Awkward drumming. Just a great song.<br />2. Vitiman: Good song. Sort of related to redifine and New Skin. Again, good gutair and drum work. Although, i still don't get these lyrics. What do they mean?<br />3. New Skin: The hit song on this album. Also, possibably the best song on this album.<br />4. Idiot Box: Okay. It's not all that great. A little too much scratches from the DJ.<br />5. Glass: Your average song. good hard rock and vocals from the singer. <br />6. Magic Medicine: What the heck? This shows NO talent from the band at all! Although it does show talent from the DJ. Otherwise, this was just a pointless. . . song or what ever you want to call it.<br />7. A certain shade of green: Great opening! One of the best ones i've heard in a long time. the rest of the song is good too.<br />8. Favorite Things: great. just great. and im not being sarcastic. They really did a good job on this song.<br />9. Summer romance [anti gravity love song]: Just bad. this shows the least talent that someone can have. <br />10. Nebula: regular song. not that great.<br />11. Deep Inside: Not that great either. Ok rock but otherwise, not a good listen.<br />12. Calgone: A pointless song.<br />So this album earns a good 5 stars because of it's really good tracks. As you notice, they start to fade near the end of the album. Overall, good buy, good listen, and well worth your money!!
0399146253|5.0|The Last Precinct is an intricate mosaic that slowly forms a compeling picture as Cornwell masterfully reveals the vulnerability and humanity of our friend Kay Scarpetta as she struggles with the ultimate challenge of her career. Cornwell's work is richly layered as she treats us to a much greater understanding of not only Scarpetta, but her former lover Benton and Dr. Anna Zenner, a psychiatrist that has befriended Kay and provides her much needed counsel during this tumultuous time.<br />New York District Attorney, Jaime Berger plays a prominent and often elusive role in The Last Precinct, driving the book to its ultimate conclusion.  I certainly hope we'll see more of Kay and Jaime and Anna in future books.  They shower us with intellect, compassion, insight and intrigue.
078322737X|5.0|The first movie to have an ambient musical soundtrack (there is perhaps a word for that), much like the sound that would later announce the arrival of the storm troopers in Star Wars, Lucas makes a very funny film. The best scence is when the nerd in the movie is trying to steal some beer and is shot at by the store owner; perhaps what makes it so hilarious is the complete disparity between the act and its punishment. In the end, the greaser dies and Richie Cunningham lives and stays in Modesto, and Richard Dreyfuss flies away on a plane, still searching for that blond in the convertible. The greaser is reborn, however, in Happy Days as Fonzi, but Richie Cunningham gets to play himself again. How old is Fonzi? If he is old, then he is a very creepy, and if he is young, then he is terribly miscast. Either way, the working class greaser gets magical powers in his Happy Days afterlife: he can snap his fingers and the girls come running, or turn on the jukebox by hitting it just right. Otherwise he would just be a sad figure of pity, living upstairs in Mrs. C's attic, the greaser glory just so much motor oil. Better to die in a not-so-tragic accident at the end of the movie.
B00003CXBK|4.0|Princess Mononoke is indeed a wonderful movie.  The story is absolutely gripping and the animation is breath takingly breath taking. But there are some parts of the movie that do tend to be boring.  Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie, but it does have its slow parts where it has the viewer shouting, &quot;get on with it!&quot;  Also the translation is great, but there are some weird moments where you just have to go &quot;huh?&quot;  I don't want to ruin the movie, so I'm not going to put any examples.  I also want to let the squeamish people know that the violence in the movie is no where near &quot;saving Private Ryan&quot; range.  There's some cutting off of some limbs, but the animation makes it more humorous than sickening.  All in all, Princess Mononoke is a keeper for the many Anime fans out there.  For the non-anime fans, try renting it first, before actually making a purchase.  Oh yeah!  Also before watching the movie, I had extremely high expectations, that maybe the reason why I found some parts of the movie boring.  That's all I have to say.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|The first thing you will notice after Triumph of the Will is that there is no narration, only the sound of the speeches or the rallies, not all of them electrifying, some scenes just mundane marches through the altstadt. Hitler, of course, is strangely fascinating (there is no other word) and effete. It is said that he studied and mimicked the expressions of opera singers, the expressions of pain--he wanted you to feel his pain--and not triumph, which is why the title is so ironic. There  is also a strong homoerotic ambience, especially when Hitler exhorts a stadium of young men to &quot;hardness&quot; and struggle. There is not a far leap from the Wandervogel to the Hitler youth (consider also Albert Speer's love for Hitler). Erik Erikson, in an essay that was the first to use the now common notion of &quot;identity&quot; in its contemporary meaning, interpreted Hitler as a kind of leader of an adolescent gang in a society of paterfamilias. The Hitler of the &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; is that gang leader.
B0000203Y5|5.0|Think of the contradictions that Cuba embodies. This island, a former tropical &quot;party central&quot; for free-spending Americans, has turned into a Z-rate vacation resort for cash-strapped communists. Poor in natural resources, rich in human talent. Once poised to lob missiles at us, now it only launches raftfuls of immigrants. <br />The restrictions on travel and trade between our two countries, have been nothing short of forbidding. In order for Cuba's cultural treasures to reach our shores, you almost had to hope for a bottle to wash up on our beaches. In practice, we waited for the occasional baseball player or musician to break through the Cigar Curtain.<br />With &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;, Ry Cooder and Wim Wenders show us what we've been missing out on. A warm, likeable, down to earth people you want to love. Music so rhythmic and delicious, it makes your soul's tongue hang out.  70 year olds who can sing so richly and eloquently about passion and romance, they put to shame the whole American ethos of youth and sex.<br />The documentary unfolds an unhurried look into a world where life is defined by a direct soulfulness, not by material possessions. The film's audiovisual balance is just perfect: colorful urban textures and wistful tropical landscapes blend with a Grammy-level soundtrack. The music itself is a godsend, cool melodies and sensual hot percussion. Real instruments, no gimmicks. This, my friends, is caliente unplugged.<br />As the camera follow the musicians through the alleys and buildings of Havana, as we listen to their simple heartfelt stories, we learn something priceless. We need these Cuban artists, and they need us. We need their relaxed humanity, their soulful culture to counterbalance our materialism. They need the mass recognition that's been denied during so many years of political embargoes.<br />In the end, the emotional tug of this film and its music may be more powerful than any missile or baseball contract. And to think, if it hadn't been for Cooder and Wenders, we would have lost forever the chance to witness these captivating, old school Cuban masters.
6305892806|1.0|I have both read the books and purchased the videos of most of Austin's works.  I was anxious to see this movie hoping it would be as well done as &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.  Not far into the film, when young Fanny inquired about the noise from the slave ship, I knew there was a problem.   This production had nothing in common with the book and must have Jane Austin spinning in her grave.  The subtlety of her characters and ability to make her point by innuendo are just what make her books so good.  Patricia's personal agenda has no business being produced under the title &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;.
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|Simultaneously the funniest and most pathetic movie I've ever seen. How does Scary Movie accomplish that? Easy. They take some truly hilarious dialogue and sprinkle it with perhaps the most hackneyed plot and scripting ever seen in motion pictures. This movie would have been so much better if it didn't constantly make reference to the fact that they were following a script. That worked in movies like I'm Gonna Get You Sucka and Hollywood Shuffle, but Scary Movie totally overdoes it by using it as a means of progressing the &quot;plot&quot;.<br />Anyway, the movie is still worth seeing only for the insanely funny killer and rips on Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Everything else should be ignored if at all possible.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Sleepy Hollow is another classic from the director who brought us Ed Wood and Beetlejuice.  Tim Burton injects this film with plenty of creepy atmosphere and a great cast of characters.  Johnny Depp is such a wonderful actor - believable and watchable.  This film also manages to put some humor into the story, and the special effects are good.  It's a DVD worth owning!
B0000039LE|2.0|This movie was nice and scary but there are a few things that this halloween movie is MISSING: this movie has NO gore 2nd does not show michael myers and 3rd ITS BORING. I think halloween 2 4 5 6 and H20 was the best in the series but if u want nice gore and see micheal myers killing people in gory ways than watch the others in the series but stay away from this crap! and stay away from HALLOWEEN 3 that has NO micheal myers and NO gore again!
B0000041Z3|5.0|The best version of Sibelius' 1st I've ever heard.<br />The best 3rd I've ever heard (perhaps a desert island disc)<br />The best 4th I've ever heard<br />The best 7th I've ever heard<br />The best 1st movement to the 5th I've ever heard.
B00004Z459|5.0|I kind of went out on a limb and bought this CD after only hearing one song -- &quot;One Step Closer&quot;. I was extremely pleased with it though. After listining to it I've decided my favorite song has to be &quot;In the End&quot; -- the vocals on that track are really awesome. I think this band will make it in their genre because of their original sound. This CD is definitely worth buying.
B00004X0Q0|1.0|This CD is so bad it's embarrassing.  One star is too high a rating.  I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.
B000005DQR|5.0|This is very well one of the greatest albums ever made. And the reason is because it is music. It's like a jazz album. And for me it's the best jazz album I have ever heard since Kind Of Blue (Miles Davis).<br />It's not techno, infact it's the farthest thing from it. For me it's a mix between jazz and hip hop. Dj Shadow grew up as a hip hop kid, collected records since he was younger than 13 or something, and made this album.<br />The extraordinary thing about it is that it is 100 percent samples. Not many people will believe it when they first hear it, because it's crafted together to sound like it isn't samples. For example, how many people have heard a hip hop track with a deep piano sample (that also isn't &quot;funky&quot; whatsoever) throughout the whole song? Or emotional female vocals to fill in empty spots (that's also a sample)? Or better yet, how many have ever heard, in their whole lives, a song that has a classical bass loop, mixed with a female vocals, mixed with a funky wah wah guitar, and a heavy slowed down hip hop beat? When I first heard it I thought to myself &quot;oh he must be playing that piano&quot; or &quot;oh he's probably got a keyboard that can do that&quot; or &quot;his girl is probably doing the vocals there&quot;. But it isn't like that at all, his keyboard, piano, and girl who can sing is his records!<br />This album is different, and that is the great thing about it.<br />Now another fun thing to figure out is where the hell did he get all those damn samples? There's some samples on this album that NO ONE knows about! And that's another extraordinary thing, it truly shows how much he worked on this album.<br />I saw a review back here that said his beats weren't raw and rugged, well this is as raw as it gets. And a few said that it was very hard to dance to, well if you want something like that then go buy an album by a guy who has a drum machine that goes up to 400 bpm and a keyboard that has a few keys on it. Another one said thatthis isn't the best drum and bass record they've ever heard, well read the above comment. And finally, I read one review that said his DJ skills are like those of a dj who plays at a bar, well he has many many records, and if he's been around his tables for that long, he probably knows a lot more than a bar dj about djing.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Let me save you some time--  the first time you put this album in your cd player, push the repeat button.  You'll want to hear it over and over again.  I've had this album for way over a year, and I still listen to it on a daily basis.  I first heard Dido when I worked in a music store last summer.  I immediately fell in love with it, and have since had to buy five copies of it because people keep stealing it from me--  it is THAT good.  There are no words to describe how beautiful this woman's voice is--  &quot;haunting&quot; is the only word that comes close.  On No Angel, Dido mixes acoustic, techno, and trip-hop (among others) seamlessly.  There is no such thing as a &quot;bad song&quot; on this album.  I am very happy that she has finally caught on, but, in a way, I am kind of jealous that she'll no longer be &quot;my little secret&quot;.
B00003CX8J|4.0|Nowadays most films under the sci-fi-action genre are so predictable. It's like you've seen one comic adapted or alien movie and already you've seen them all. But this film ranks among one of those exempted from that view. This maybe due to the brilliant craftsmanship of director Bryan Singer, who I guess understands fully how people wanted this film to turn out. What made him perfect for the job might have been because he grew up within the years of this comic series' popularity peak. I don't really have to explain what the plot of the movie is, it's plain simple. Mutant baddies, mutant good-guys, showdown. But what curiously caught my attention about this film was the casting that was made for the characters. Everybody seemed so perfect for the roles, especially Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen. Of course the others were great but these actors really lit the movie screen.  So to my friends and the people who snobbed this movie, I say that was one big mistake...bub!
0790729733|5.0|Oliver Stone did his homework and produced a great film that we may now enjoy some of the truth about the murder of JFK. <br />The best way to watch this movie is to not only pay very close attention to the film, but better yet, watch a two tape series called &quot;The Men Who Killed Kennedy&quot; before you watch the film JFK. It is to my knowledge the best comprehensive study of the circumstances in and around Dealy Plaza on Nov. 22, as well as giving many researchers a chance to speak about their findings over a 30+ year period of investigation. One of the things that makes the series so interesting is the research done into all the possible shooters that were retained for the job.  <br />The only failing of the series is that there is no mention of the shot that came from the storm sewer to the right of the motorcade (which probably blew his head off ), or the dozens of people who died of mysterious heart attacks and accidents in the weeks following the assassination. As far as I know though, nobody has made mention of this to date except a few of the more eccentric researchers into the assassination.<br />The best research into the reasons that Kennedy was murdered for me, came from Prevailing Winds Research Magazine based in Santa Barbara Ca.. It was explained to me in an understandable way that Kennedy was trying to stop the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War, and was setting up parallel intelligence agencies that were in direct conflict with the established CIA that was born out of WWII and the mass recruitment of NAZI's. These were just a few of the many things that Kennedy did to bury himself. Kennedy's brother later said it best when someone asked him why he did not run for president and he replied &quot;the bullets, the bullets, the bullets&quot;.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|I was never really a Beatles fan, mostly because I was a little kid who didn't know any better. So I can't say it's better than the original stuff. But I can say this...If you've never had a Beatles album like me, and want to hear some of their stuff - this is a CD you must have. I already love this album. It's great!
B00004U8H4|1.0|This is a dreary, ugly piece of garbage.  There is absolutely no one or nothing to care about in this movie.  There is no suspense, because there is no reason to care what happens.  Christian Bale does a great job, there's just nothing for him to work with here.  The usually likable William Dafoe isn't in the movie enough to develop any sense of who his character is.  The only remotely sympathetic character is the killer's secretary, and she is also a minor character.  All the other characters are completely dislikable.<br />I feel really horrible about throwing away the (money) on  it because I've probably helped encourage Mary Harron to make another movie.  This is really a bad movie with no redeeming qualities what so ever.  The soundtrack consists of a lot of the worst music from the 80's (Huey Lewis and the News for example) combined with orchestral music that sounds like it came from a bad television show.<br />This movie was billed as a satire but there's really nothing funny or amusing about it.  Its mostly just obnoxious, shallow people hanging out together.  The movie is far to angry and empty to ever be witty or amusing even if the writers were capable of wit or intelligence.  It consists of scenes where the yuppies try to get dinner reservations at fancy restraurants, admire each other's business cards, or pontificate on the greatness of Huey Lewis while killing someone.<br />Oh yea, there's also a scene where a dog gets stomped to death.  Gee, that was hysterical.<br />If you want to see a much better movie in the same vein, see Manhunter, Silence of the Lambs, or Seven.  These movies are much more intelligent and much better made.  There are actually characters to care about in these movies and the soundtracks are great to.<br />Avoid this piece of crap at all costs and treat yourself to one of the above mentioned movies...
B00000269M|4.0|Michael Jackson maybe one of the weirdest stars in music, he wears makeup, he has ruined his looks by countless botched up plastic surgery jobs and somehow, he has even managed to change his skin colour. But, all that aside, he has made some of the most memorable pop and dance music ever, and this album just goes to prove that you cannot judge music by the 'cover'. Greatly overshadowed by various scandals and tabloid stories, Michael's music became secondary and some people even refused to buy his records because of that. And that's too bad, because what you have on this album are well produced, well performed dance/pop songs, one a duet with Stevie Wonder. 16 page booklet includes lyrics and photos.
6301562143|4.0|Who would of thought that this would be great. A film directed by Tim Burton starring Michael Keaton as Batman? But it IS great! Great art direction, action scenes and plot. And Nicholson is perfect as the Joker.
B00003CXFG|3.0|This movie is scary.  For a while, at least.  It is visually unlike anything Ridley Scott, George Lucas, or other mainstream directors ever turned out.  Fresh?  That would be pushing it a bit.  But it is appealing.  The screenplay - playing off of the same theme as Jaws - what you don't see can scare you - works.  For a little while.  There isn't anything to make you care about these characters as more than a few meet their demise.  <br />The sound quality is good, and Vin Diesel is excellent in his role.  The other actors didn't have much material to work with.  The character development is weak due to a so-so screenplay, but if you are just looking for a film that is more on the lines of a modern Blob or Thing, you might enjoy this.  Right up there with Starship Troopers and Phantasm.
6304913176|4.0|This is a movie that is based on an old story, done with up-to-date F/X that makes it lots of fun. Ok, it is aimed at pubesent boys, and the shower scene could have been cut, and it's not totally faithful to the book... But I liked it enough to buy a copy, my ultimate honor for movies.
B000050XEI|4.0|Another year, another Enya cd. The one shortcoming of Enya's music is that it seldom changes. Listening to all five Enya cds drives this point home. She has an amazing voice but she isn't Peter Gabriel with her music. There are slight differences from cd to cd, but Enya mainly sticks to her formula for New Age pop. &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; starts with the title song, just like 1995's &quot;Memory of Trees&quot;, 1991's &quot;Sheperd Moons&quot;, 1988's &quot;Watermark&quot; and 1986's &quot;The Celts&quot; started their title songs, an instrumental that does not add or subtract from the entire disc. &quot;Wild Child&quot; sounds similar to &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;, &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot; or &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; while &quot;Only Time&quot; sounds similar to &quot;Wild Child&quot;. Another instrumental &quot;Tempus Vernum&quot; sounds like 1988's &quot;Cursum Perficio&quot; and is so short it could have been left off the cd. &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; closes with &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, &quot;One By One&quot; and &quot;Lazy Days&quot; which all sound great, but hasn't Enya done these songs before? I have been a fan of Enya since 1989, but with her last two cds I began to feel slightly cheated. Does Enya think her fans would abandon her if she changed with each new release? I wouldn't. She's got a great voice and makes some great songs, but her cds, as a whole, are beginning to be like eating my favorite food every day. If you are a fan, you will probably buy this, but if you are just getting into Enya, buy &quot;Sheperd Moons&quot; or &quot;Watermark&quot; or even her best of compilation. I am now waiting for Enya to surprise me with her music--what has she got to lose?
B0000029DD|5.0|There are so few Human Beings who have the ability to excite you, calm you, and inspire you at the same time...If you love basketball it's Michael Jordan...Football, maybe it was the late and great Walter Payton...(Hold tight, there is a point)  Thank God they shared their gift with us...That is the only way I can describe how I feel about Jeff Buckley and his music...Thank God he got to share it with us!  As I first began listening to Grace, I was impressed with it just as I am with anything else that might happen to be on the radio.  The more I listened (truly listened) I realized how amazingly talented and truthful this unique soul was.  He truly wears his soul on his sleeve, and in a way allows you to peak inside as you listen...If you're a fan of Leonard Cohen, you'll love his cover of Hallelujah...and if you're a hopeless romantic like myself, &quot;Lover, You Should've Come Over&quot; will getcha every time...I was asked, &quot;What if you could only keep one CD, what would it be?&quot;  And without a hesitation...GRACE by Jeff Buckley...although I didn't feel that way when I first bought it, there is no doubt that I would start selling my plasma before I sold the CD!  Yeah, that's a bit extreme, but I said there would be a point, right?  Happy listening!
B000025AJM|4.0|I had never heard of King Crimson until a friend mentioned them to me and said I had to buy the album even if it was only for the cover. This was 1971 when I was 15. It blew me away. I was always terrified by the opening track. Looking back it all seems a little pretentious but in 1971 it was way ahead of its time
B000002NAK|4.0|Understand that after I first heard a recording of Evita (with Patti and Mandy), I spent six monthes obsessed with all things Eva. When I first heard that Madonna and Antonio were to star in the film version, I had mixed emotions, but decided to have an open mind. <br />The real surprise of the production was Banderas, who more than held his own in the role, removing much of the exaggerated sarcasim accessorised by earlier Che interpretation and bringing to it a sense of irony, understanding, frustration, and even a underlying desparation to not just give Evita a dose of reality, but a hope that it somehow wasn't too late for her to change her ways and make a positive change. His accent actually adds to the flavor of his voice, rather than taking away from it (nevertheless, I don't think it would help in the role of the Phatom, which I've heard he's campaigning for-but he proved us wrong once before). He is convincing as Che on the screen (he certainly looks more Argentine than Madonna, but many Argentines were of Italian descent, including Peron(i), so who am I to say?), leaving a lasting impression of a true youth revolutionary: all passion, some direction, little chance.<br />As for Madonna, I found her vocal performance to be suttle, but pleasing. Obviously, she doens't have the range of many previous Evitas, especially in the higher octaves, but she makes up in her stresses and timing. But her acting is certainly the best in the film of any film of hers I've seen. Many critics point out that Madonna's life and Evita's have had many similarities: i.e., extreme intelligence, rise to power often accredited to loose behavior, a thirst for power and success, etc. But most importantly I believe is the sense of isolation that fame brings, and searching for the one who ends it. This parellel is never more apparent than in the film scene in which Eva is sitting among the aristrocacy, yet alone, seemingly outcast (&quot;The actress hasn't learned the lines you'd like tohear&quot;). It is clear that Madonna is not acting in this scene, that she had felt or feels this way in her life. <br />Jonathan Pryce is surprisingly disappointing. He clearly did not understand the difference between movies and broadway. Many of his numbers find him merely talking through the notes, and acting is next to none. A real surprise after hearing &amp; seeing his performance in Miss Saigon, in which he was superb.
0385484518|5.0|There's a really good reason this book has been a best seller for as long as it has: it's a true story that teaches us the basic things in life to make us happy.  The truth is that the majority of the people want the kind of advice that Morrie offers here.  Those who don't either live by it already or are afraid to take it.<br />This is not a touchy-feely book, although it is emotional.  It is an enjoyable story and a book that can be used as a self-help book for anyone in need of a little stability.
B0000067X1|5.0|I have just been introduced to this band and I must say, &quot;I can't believe how far ahead of their time they were.&quot;  This album is incredible - even by today's terms.  I guess I got into them via Radiohead(listed as comparisons in many reviews of KID A), and I'm sure glad I did.  This is some incredible music.  As always, I'm looking for music that will expand my horizons, and this album has done it.  From the Twin Peaks-ish singing on Mushroom to the overwhelming funky epic of Halleluwah, this album is strong from beginning to end.  I'm just thankful that they have so much music available.  I'll start my journey with this album and hope that the rest are as great as TAGO MAGO.  A must buy indeed.
0552124753|4.0|In the prologue to chapter two, Pratchett writes a description of his fictional world that doubles as an interesting piece of self-analysis: &quot;The discworld offers sights far more impressive than those found in universes built by Creators with less imagination but more mechanical aptitude.&quot;  I couldn't agree more.<br />To begin with, there is something extremely beautiful and awe-inspiring in the construction of the world itself: a giant terrestrial disc, perched upon the backs of four giant elephants, perched upon the back of an even more giant interstellar and androgynous turtle.  From the get go, we know that our author-guide is blessed with a prodigious imagination.  And his characters are fascinating; they are quirky in the best of ways.  Rincewind, the failed wizard with one spell that even he doesn't know the effect of, is a curmudgeon of the highest order.  But bless his heart, his will to live is extraordinary.  He is paired with a wealthy tourist named Twoflower, who possesses a wide-eyed innocence perfect for leading our introduction to this made-up world.  These two, along with Twoflower's Luggage (a chest made of &quot;sapient pearwood&quot; with dozens of determined legs -- ha-ha!), are a great 'Laurel and Hardy'-style duo (&quot;That's another fine mess you got me into,&quot; says Rincewind at one point).  They are comic and bumbling, with a lovable chemistry.<br />The story, as some others have said, is less than focused.  There are some sparkling scenes, but the overall narrative is rather flimsy.  That's fine seeing as this is the first book in the series, and exposition should take precedence over story.  But things do get confusing at times.  Regardless, it is a fun ride.  I've got the next two books sitting on top of my reading pile, and I can't wait to get at them.
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater is typically scorned or adored by progressive rock fans. They certainly have their critics; there's no shortage of people derisively accusing them of overindulgent musicianship and pompous compositions. Concurrently, they have a fiercely devoted legion of fans who praise them as the torchbearers of progressive metal. Their definitive brand of progmetal spawned a good number of copycat bands, none of which can equal the preeminent originality and overall musicianship of Dream Theater.<br />With a ton of new material and new vocalist James LaBrie, Dream Theater hammered out an incredible piece of work with Images And Words, their breakthrough album, often lauded as their best. LaBrie was the ultimate choice to replace former singer Charlie Dominici; his operatic training, tempered with the aggressiveness of metal, was perfectly suited to DT's theatrical and soaring compositions. Whereas Dominici could not support the band's intensity, LaBrie's powerful tenor and ability to change notes on a dime surpasses all but the greatest singers in the metal genre.<br />I&amp;W's predecessor, When Dream And Day Unite, was merely a vague indication of where this band was headed. By way of comparison, Images And Words is more complex, engaging, unique, and sincere. The myriad style influences, lengthy and elaborate instrumental passages, deep lyrics, curious meter measures and shifting time signatures imbued the band with a quality infrequently experienced. John Petrucci is incontrovertibly the greatest guitar virtuoso to emerge in the 90s; Mike Portnoy's drums clearly mark him as the next Neil Peart; John Myung's impossibly complex bass lines are unmatched in their intricacy; Kevin Moore's weaving keyboard dynamics support the heavy guitar focus, but sometimes his lyrical piano leads take center stage, and he proves that just how emotionally powerful that instrument can be. Independently, they are incredible musicians. Together, they form a single, cohering unit whose rapport is unmatched.<br />And the songs? Complex enough to dazzle, but not enough to sacrifice engaging melodic elements, this album is simply replete with good songs. Every song is indubitably superb, but special mention goes to &quot;Metropolis Part I,&quot; a mesmerizingly complex track that establishes the foundation for &quot;Metropolis Part II - Scenes From a Memory,&quot; the mind-blowing concept album that would be released seven years later.e rapport is unmatched.<br />And the songs?

0671510991|5.0|Described variously as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and a &quot;profound&quot; _Diplomacy_ is a 'must read'. <br />Regardless of your opinion regarding his politics, there is no escaping the profound impact Henry Kissinger has had on late twentieth century strategic relations. Similarly, whether they vex or inspire you, the insights he outlines in _Diplomacy_ are consistently enlightening and regularly brilliant. A thoroughly researched and expertly presented text, _Diplomacy_ offers novices a solid introduction to the history of strategic relations and experts a challenging set of theories and interpretations. Furthermore, despite the dense and often dry nature of the history of diplomacy, Kissinger's presentation of his subject matter is accessible and compelling.<br />Admittedly, however, there is a flaw to the text not altogether uncommon to Kissinger's writing. He has been criticised in the past, and rightly so, for not attending adequately to economic factors in international relations. _Diplomacy_, while addressing economics to a degree, retains this failing, minimising the importance of economic factors in international relations by omission.<br />Despite this shortcoming, however, _Diplomacy_ remains a vitally important book and one I cannot recommend too highly.
B000002VRZ|3.0|I purchased this to replace the 8 track I had back in the 70's...( yes the 70's ) This version falls a little short of the original 8 track, but worth listening to. You will need to to scan thru most of the songs to get to the &quot; good  stuff&quot;. Some are pretty silly such as the CB Breaker Breaker song, but to hear Green Grass and High Tides all cleaned up is worth the investment. Would really like to find the CD version of that 8 track, because several songs from that tape are missing on this &quot; best of&quot; and the one that are included as &quot; best of ' are awful. Either that or it was the drugs in the the 70's!!
B000050XEI|5.0|I'm appalled by some of the reviews I've seen for this album. My day is not complete without listening to it. It's a &quot;brighter&quot; side of Enya. Her last album, 1995's &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot;, was beautiful but dark, with full heart-tugging melodies and thought-provoking lyrics. &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is much simpler, but still just as beautiful. She continues her tradition of having the title track of her album an instrumental track, and &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is a beautiful song. Some people complain that she doesn't sing on all of the songs - but they forget that Enya plays all instruments on her albums, and that every vocal you hear is Enya's. No wonder it takes so long for Enya to record her albums. Stand-out tracks: Wild Child (for the Kokopeli [spell] in all of us), Only Time (first single/video - FANTASTIC), Fallen Embers (great wedding song), One By One, and Lazy Days. Enya is a genre in herself. Hopefully, her next album won't take 5 years to complete, but even if it does, my copy of &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; will not leave my cd player, and probably still won't long after her next masterpiece is set out into the world.
B00000K0DT|5.0|The Usual Suspects is a real treat for movie lovers who enjoy film noir and caper movies. The Oscar-winning screenplay and the excellent cast makes every scene rich with texture. I put my DVD player on \\"shuffle play\\" and let the scenes come up in any order - you'll see what I mean. One of my main measures for buying a DVD is how often I watch it, and you have to watch this a number of times just to appreciate all that goes on. It also takes a few passes to figure out what the heck Benicio del Toro's character is even saying in the semi-intelligible voice he has chosen. It's throwaway humor, but you've go to dig to find it. I loved it.<br />It's an exciting thiller and it's so FUNNY without breaking the mood. Many of the jokes are only understood in retrospect, though, making repeat viewing mandatory. Kevin Spacey is always aces, but he earns his Oscar as he introduces us to the story of Keyser Soze - a new name that everyone will know. Second best movie of the 90's - right behind LA Confidential.<br />Okay - that was the old review - I've since bought the special edition, and I highly recommend it. Deleted scenes and the blooper reel are so-so, but the discussions with the actors are fascinating, as is the trip to the Cannes film festival. Best bits were the discussions of the infamous lineup and the other actors' comments about Benicio's intentionally unintelligible dialogue.<br />P.S. - I just recently caught the movie on network TV, where they overdubbed \\"Give me the keys, you fairy godmother.\\" And some people will wonder what all the buzz was about.

0393964582|5.0|The 19th Century bequeathed us four immediately recognizable, vibrant &amp; enduring fictional icons:  Shelley's Frankenstein; Stoker's Dracula; Melville's Moby Dick (&amp; Ahab); and Conan Doyle's  Sherlock Holmes.  Each of them has, I fear, suffered a horrible fate: they are so familiar to us, in their  many modern incarnations &amp; imitations, that too few people return to the original texts.  This may be  particularly true of Frankenstein, whose portrayals have been so frivolous and distorted.  In fact, in  addition to being written in luxuriant gothic prose, the original novel is one of the most profound  meditations on Man and his purpose and relation to God that has exists in our literature.<br />Victor Frankenstein is a young man of Geneva who is fascinated by the sciences and the secrets of  life  and death:<br />  My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my  temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager  desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately.  I confess that  neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the  politics of various states possessed attractions for me.  It was the secrets of  heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward  substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man  that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in  its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.<br />While at University in Ingolstadt, his life course is set when he hears a professor lecture on modern  chemistry:<br />  'The ancient teachers of this science,'said he, 'promised impossibilities and  performed nothing.  The modern masters promise very little; they know that  metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera.  But these  philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to  pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles.  They  penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her  hiding-places.  They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood  circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.  They have acquired new and  almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heavens, mimic the  earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.'<br />  Such were the professor's words--rather let me say such were the words of the  fate--enounced to destroy me.<br />Victor goes on to discover, through the study of chemistry, the secret of bringing dead flesh to life.  Inevitably he tests his discovery and of viewing his creation cries:<br />How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such  infinite pains and care I had endeavored to form?  His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected  his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles  and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness;  but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of  the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and  straight black lips.<br />And so, repelled by the mere appearance, the inevitable imperfection, of his work, Frankenstein  rejects the creature utterly.  However, unlike the mute stupid monster of the movies, Shelley's monster  is articulate and sensitive and longs for companionship, but all of humankind reacts to him with  horror.  And so he demands that Frankenstein build him a mate.  When Frankenstein refuses to  provide him with a companion, the creature resolves to destroy those who Frankenstein loves.<br />Finally, Frankenstein determines that he must destroy the creature and pursues him into the frozen  wastes of the North.<br />It all makes for a rousing adventure, butthere is much more here.  Frankenstein, through his work,  has attempted to become a god, but his creation is a horrible disappointment &amp; so, is banished from  him.  Meanwhile, his flawed creation, filled with ineffable longing and confusion, wanders in exile  seeking the meaning of his existence.  And what is the impulse that he settles upon, but another act of  creation; a mate must be created for him.  The Biblical parallels are obvious, but they work on us  subtly as we read the novel.  In the end, the uncontrollable urge to create, to imitate God, stands  revealed as Man's driving force.  And the inevitable disappointment of the creator in his creation, is  revealed as the serpent in the garden.<br />If you've never read this book, read it now.  If you've read it before, read it again.<br />GRADE: A+using adventure, but there is much more here.

And what is the impulse that he settles upon, but another act of  creation; a mate must be created for him.  The Biblical parallels are obvious, but they work on us  subtly as we read the novel.  In the end, the uncontrollable urge to create, to imitate God, stands  revealed as Man's driving force.  And the inevitable disappointment of the creator in his creation, is  revealed as the serpent in the garden.<br />If you've never read this book, read it now.  If you've read it before, read it again.<br />GRADE: A+
B00004YW6I|5.0|alright these are great songs wether being ripped off or not(will people stop comparing and listen for once). the songs on this are much more straight foward than on others but that doesnt mean a thing at all. each song is very complex. i know a lot of you think the lyrics are not that good. i think the fact that they are so simple is what makes them so profound. yes the patti smith influence is evident on songs like good fortune and big exit but for crying out loud, its not like pet sounds sounded like phil spector or anything(no, i dont think this should be compared to pet sounds), i think you should definitely pay homage to your influences.  oh if polly could get a hold of all of you that bad mouthed her.........she would make you cry.      love this
B000002NFM|3.0|Well, I guess the guys in Prodigy decided they wanted to conquer the rock scene, having already been major players on dancefloors. While it worked for a time (this is still the only techno-type album ever to hit #1 in the States), many dance fans saw this as a sell-out, and most rock fans forgot about the band after discovering the dance songs. Finally, though, this is definitely not as good an album as the previous two. The skill of the Prodigy is in dance music, not rock music.<br />That said, this isn't a bad album at all. &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;Firestarter&quot; are both a lot of fun. &quot;Funky S***&quot; takes a vocal sample from the Beastie Boys' &quot;Root Down&quot; ('Oh my God, that's the funky sh--!') and works it around a dark dance groove. &quot;Minefields&quot; and &quot;Climbatize&quot; are great examples of purer techno, and &quot;Smack My B**** Up&quot; is fantastic.<br />So it's not nearly as good as &quot;Experience&quot; or &quot;Music For The Jilted Generation&quot;, and there may be some truth to the idea of the Prodigy as sellouts. But it's a pretty good album anyways, so if you liked the singles or the band it's worth your money.
B000003H34|5.0|After buying Pentecost III, I was sure I had exhausted Anathema's worthy recordings. As a huge fan of Darren's vocals, I wasn't sure I could stand anything else. Well, I overcame my fear recently and bought Silent Enigma. I have no regrets, whatsoever. It turns out the vocals (performed by guitarist Vincent Cavanagh) are excellent, though different from Darren's. People have compared them to Celtic Frost. I've only heard a couple of CF songs, but I guess its a fair comparison. The music follows the path that Pentecost III was taking. No extreme changes have taken place. While each of the songs were pretty different from each other in P3, though, these songs are more consistent. That doesn't mean they're all the same song, they just fit together in a single album better. Overall, I was impressed with the general quality of this album. While nothing jumps out at me as brilliant, this is well produced and performed, original doom. I recommend this to fans of previous albums, but cannot speak for fans of recent albums.
B0000024JN|5.0|&quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; is not high art. In fact, it sounds terrible on paper. The production combines cheesy beats with hard rock samples (really, really blatant hard rock samples). The lyrics cover topics like girls, liquor, and robbery in a very funny but very crude way. And of course, the rapping is done by three white kids with very whiny voices. It looks like absolute chaos.<br />Yet because the boys were brave enough to go all out on the formula, it works perfectly. In fact, when they're rapping about cab drivers recognizing their date from the back of her head over a basic rap beat and guitar stolen off Led Zeppelin's &quot;The Ocean&quot;, all you can do is laugh along and admire the Beasties for their bravery. The end result: half of these songs are classics, the other half almost could be, and the album is the pinnacle of rock/rap combos. Buy it and enjoy.
1881273156|1.0|This book, in my opinion, did not relate to me at all.  Not only was the book based on Christian beliefs, but also it focused on married couples.  I am not married and do not use christianity as the basis for how to live a fulfilling life.  This book would be more helpful to those who are married, perhaps.
B0000025ZF|5.0|I love the Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking. The lyrics are some of Roger's best and most colorful and Eric Clapton on guitar playing within a Pink Floydian framework is phenomenal. While the entire work is great, Every Strangers Eyes is in my view the most heartfelt lyric Roger had written up to that point in time and seemed to signify a turning point of sorts. He may have followed this enlightened outlook more successfully later in the song The Tide is Turning, but the childlike sense of awakening in this realization comes across more honestly here as a true moment of clarity.  Also the concert program from the tour remains one of the best programs ever made, offering insight into the work as well as fantastic art from Gerald Scarfe and plenty of concert photos too. The CD should be re-released  with all of this stuff included as it would only enhance a work that is already as brilliant and inspiring as it is moving.
0811826848|5.0|I was eight or nine years old and vividly remember my girl friend Joy Ferris inviting me into her bedroom. Her mother wasn't home and her brothers were out in the nieghborhood so I felt at ease when she asked me to sit on her bed in the darkened bedroom. Joy put &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot; on the record player and slipped into her bathroom to change. When she came out she modeled her swim suit and kiss me on my cheek, God how I loved those exciting Beatles.<br />Needless to say that for my generation few artist have reached this level of ICON that these guys have. I wonder if every generation has someone they love as much as we loved the Beatles. Oh yeah the book, I think it is great!<br />Curtiss De Vedrine - author &quot;The Second Coming Of Age&quot;
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|&quot;Scary Movie&quot; parodies a number of teen scare flicks and other horror or suspense movies. A viewer who has seen movies such as &quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, and &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; will better understand some of the jokes and sight gags around which the thin story line revolves.<br />This movie is not for anyone with delicate sensibilities, as everything, including erect male sex organs, pubic hair, flatulence, and other usually taboo subjects, are ripe for gags, most of which, while filthy, are often funny. If you do not like your jokes down and dirty, then this movie is definitely not for you.
B00000I07P|5.0|This CD was ONE OF THE MOST BEST SELLING CD of the 80's. So think . . . of course it's the best. <br />The songs ARE what comes to your head when you think rock or fun or wild. And that's what BON JOVI's songs are all about.<br />BON JOVI FOREVER !
014028009X|5.0|there's not much else to say.  i was un-attracted by the cover of this book and its title, which led me to expect something cloyingly romantic or otherwise girl-seeks-boy.  within one page i was completely captivated. i laughed so hard my husband was annoyed, wanting to know what was so funny.  i had to tell him he wouldn't understand.  i have not laughed so hard in years.
6304712936|5.0|im i5 and i saw this in class and i seriously thought it would suck madjorly but much to my suprise, i loved it. I liked seeing how Mozart was totaly unlike the selfish and spoiled people around him. He did what he loved and did it regardless of anyones objections. This movie is funny at times and incredibly gives a accruate portrait of what life was like back then. Dispite Soliare's jeliousness through out the movie, it was great and funny. it's serious at times but it keeps you watching. i'd buy this movie. its really good.
B00003003R|5.0|Since I can remember, I've lamented the day that guns 'n' roses started falling apart.  I was relegated to buying sub-par bootleg CDs to get my fix, but no ther is this.  This album puts them back together to enjoy as they never will be again.  The heavy reliance upon Appetite for Destruction only helps the album.  Appetite represents all that one needs to know in order to understand what Guns n Roses was.  It would have been nice to have a few more numbers from the Illusion albums though.  Slash's guitar is as clean and sweet as it gets, slow and strong at points, and fast and passionate at others, he portrays an ultimate feeling of urgency, and leaves you desiring more.  Live Era captures much of Guns n Roses, and only heightens the craving for the reunion of the original members, because without them, there is no Guns n Roses.
0684853523|2.0|I never thought I'd hear myself say that a Stephen King book should be longer, but the writing parts of this book should have been.  There were some great nuggets of writing advice here, but not nearly enough to justify this as a writer's text.  And King only hints at the way a select few of his novels were written, when more behind-the-scenes looks at his work would have been invaluable.<br />Instead, &quot;On Writing&quot; is overly long with anecdotes like the results of young Stevie's unfortunate bowel movement in a poison ivy patch.  To illustrate the fact that alcohol is bad for the writer's psyche, King gives us an extended history of his drinking habits.  And while the last section of the book tries hard to express the importance of writing to the writer, it comes across more as a detailed account of The Accident, written for voyeuristic fans.<br />Anyone truly wishing to learn about the process of writing should skip this one and check out one of Lawrence Block's three excellent books on the subject.
B000000WA4|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins still proove to be my most favorite music group. There talent prooves to be the best as they show us many more Classic Smashing Pumpkin songs. Among my favorite are &quot;1979&quot; , &quot;beautiful&quot;, and &quot;mellon collie and the infinite sadness&quot;. All of there music is great and I would reccomend this CD to everyone.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I have been a Beatles fan for a long time and have all of these songs on separate albums and CDs, but that's the thing: Albums from the sixties are just too darn short. Finally somebody loaded a CD up with all the songs one definitely wants to hear from the Beatles. I got this CD a week ago and immediately popped it into my car CD player. Immediately noticable in that situation: the digital remastering is well done. If you remember what sixties stereo sound was like: Paul sings in the left channel and George's guitar is on the right, and the whole thing sucks on the car stereo, well this one doesn't. It hasn't lost the original feeel to it, though, and that's what good remastering is all about, to improve the overall sound quality without taking the genuine feel away. As for the song selection: no compilation is ever perfect for everybody and sure there are other songs one would have wanted to hear, but I am quite sure that after 1 there will be 2 and so forth, so I guess we catch the missing songs later. So, yes, all you baby-boomers, get out there and get one and don't forget to tell your kids how great those Beatles really were.
B00003CWTH|5.0|A movie that I, myself have been waiting for.  Hidden themes, unveiling of an extraordinary plot, and the correlation of all the actions and words out of a character to build up to one of the most mind-shattering and heart-moving endings that a movie could possibly offer.  The cinematography is perfect, used to enhance each moment of this drama.  The screenplay is no doubt the best that I have seen in movies where the director tried to weave the lives of many individuals to exploit a plot that we could all learn from.  The acting is the best that Tom Cruise, philip baker hall, john c. reilly, and Julianne Moore have ever performed, and just seeing them will tear down your hearts.  The musical score and soundtrack for the movie is practically award-deserving.  The music itself seems as if it's the tenth character, moves us with every notch and downfall.   This movie, one of my favorites, is not to be missed.  Watch it with an open mind and look hard and try to reveal for yourself the true theme.  Whatever ridiculous thing may happen that will make you wonder in stupidity, just try to see how it correlates with the plot. If you do this successfully, you will find that Magnolia is the best movie you have ever seen.
158234082X|3.0|This books gives you an idea of what it is like in the life of a chef.  After reading it, I would not want to get into this profession.  Being a cook or chef seems like a hard life from this book.  I read through this book quickly and found it interesting.  The author talks about places he has worked and the working environment.  Interesting stuff, bearable and even enjoyable if you are skimming or reading quickly, but probably boring and a waste of time for perusing.    <br />By the way, after reading what some of the author has to say, I will be a little hesistent next time I eat anything in a restuarant.  Particularly fish, meat, vegetables, or especially mussels.
6305949638|3.0|A great movie for adults and growing teenagers of the maturing of an orphan (Tobey Maguire) who decides to take his risks of living out in the open world instead of the confined spaces of the welcoming home he grew up in. The movie touches every corner of a modern-day classic, with its theme and direction. The cinematography is used just right to create the specific moods, and the screenplay, adapted from John Irving's classic, was well-done in taking a literary epic and putting it on the big screen. However, the movie is not for everyone. The movie will most likely offend conservative views and lift the liberal points of life. The major theme of the movie and the answer to your question if you should see it or not is, &quot;Is abortion just?&quot;
B000051VWW|4.0|but it's still a good investment. I have every CD Sade ever recorded and I was excited to hear this new CD, especially after an eight-year hiatus. In Lovers Rock, it seems that Sade is singing from life experience. The songs on here are a testament to some kind of personal and spiritual transformation. Some of the passion from her earlier music seems to have dissipated in this new CD. I was somewhat disappointed that this CD is shorter than Love Deluxe and her other previous recordings---this CD is only 42 minutes.  Sade still sounds beautiful and soulful but there is something missing in this new release. It's something that I cannot put into words.
6304383827|2.0|I admit, although being a great Jane Austen fan, &quot;Emma&quot; is not among my favorite of her books.  She herself said that in creating Emma, she was creating a character that no one but she would like.  <br />I just wanted to comment on the relative laughability of the historical accuracy of this version of &quot;Emma&quot;.  The costumes, while pretty to the untrained eye, are horrendous from a historical standpoint.  Look up a book on paintings or fashion plates from the Regency era to get an idea of what people really wore.  I didn't think many of them were even particularly flattering to the actors.  I also imagine Jane turning over in her grave at the scene where Emma and Mr. Knightly declare their love for one another and then promptly embrace passionately, interlocking tongues and everything else.  The expression &quot;Get a room&quot; didn't exist then, and for very good reason.  No one would've conducted themselves like that in public, and even in private, unless they were married.  The Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; shows what I think is a lovely example of how people in love would've behaved together.  In the very last scene, as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy pull away from the church in their carriage, they shyly look at each other and then slowly move in for a kiss, not quite sure how to approach it.  Then they exchange a modest kiss, not a tongue-down-each-others-throat kiss.  Elizabeth has surely never held hands with a man, much less kissed one.  It's only our horribly immodest society today that allows tongues to be seen in public.  <br />Aside from the historical accuracies, I think this version does shine in some parts.  I think this version of &quot;Emma&quot; has the best of the Miss Bates.  I also enjoy the Mrs. Elton in this version also.  <br />There is some fairly good acting here.  I do not censure the actors.  They are even fairly accurate to the original story.  I just find fault with the historical portrayal, which I think is essential to a period movie.  Nowadays film is the way that the general public becomes acquainted with different time periods.  They will come away from films like this with an incorrect understanding of the way things were in Jane Austen's time.
0201485672|2.0|The subject matter is very pertinent, but the book could have been more to the point. Some of the pages have only four lines of code; I could not understand why so much of space was left blank. Many of the techniques taught are not new and should be part of development and refactoring. It would have been nice if the authors went through each other's manuscripts and REFACTORED the book, because the book is full of repetitive material.
0920668364|5.0|My mom bought this book for me before I left for college.  That Christmas she bought it for all of my brothers AND my new born nephew.  She carried that tradition on for her next two grandchildren before she passed away.  I have taken it upon myself and continued her tradition of purchasing this book for each new born niece or nephew.  Some families have 4 copies!  A mother, grandmother or aunts love never fades - it just gets stronger!  I highly recommend this book to everyone out there.
B00000ADG2|5.0|As a general rule I am not a big fan of R&amp;B. Too many fluffy, cliche love songs and too many stupid songs that all just try to find a different way to say &quot;let's get naked&quot;.<br />It was my recent purchase of Erykah Badu's (another R&amp;B artist who is creative enough to sing about more than just getting naked) newest cd that forced me to finally try this cd. Yes folks, it's almost 2001 and I just bought THE MISEDUCATION OF LAURYN HILL about 2 weeks ago.<br />What was I waiting for?? This cd clearly illustrates that Pop/R&amp;B/Rap can indeed have substance, emotional depth, and intelligence. It can be about more than trying to score a hit and own a Lexus. Although this is only Lauryn's first solo cd it has proven that she is one of the foremost poets of her generation (my generation).<br />Lauryn has it all, in my opinion. She has a beautiful voice, she raps with a unique sense of rhythm, attitude, strength, and intelligence, and her lyrics are incredible. Unlike some of the reviews I read here, I think many of Lauryn's strongest spiritual and emotional statements come during her rapping. There is just no denying the power of the universal truths she speaks during the rap breaks in LOST ONES, FINAL HOUR, and EVERYTHING IS EVERYTHING.<br />Lauryn feels and expresses the full range of vocal emotion. From all-out strength, to yearning desire for a better life (for others, not herself), to an almost omniscient channelling into the human soul.<br />If everyone would treat life and music as if it were something to be cherished, something that can be used to help others and bring joy into peoples lives the way Lauryn does we'd be on our way to that better world that humanity dreams of.
079284131X|5.0|I really love this movie.  First of all, it ended that terrible my buddy phase with children.  I remembered my sister had one of the &quot;My Buddy&quot; dolls (which look like Chucky) and once she saw the TV commerical for this movie she threw it away in the fireplace.  I don't blame her, Chucky is very scary at some sequences in this movie.  The director probably intended that, because almost every one is scared of dolls.  I mean look at them with their human like eyes, they look like they're thinking about something, it really disturbs me.  So let's talk about the actually movie now.  The opening sequence introduces you to Chucky, a serial killer who is in quite a bind with the police as of now.  At the end of the chase Chucky ends up in a toy store and is shot.  His dying words are a strange voodoo curse (which strangely resemble the ingredients of Arby's food) that transfer his soul to another body.  The body is, you guessed it a doll.  Then, the film is interrupted with a CHEESY CARTOON!  You have to see the good guy doll commercial, you won't forget it anytime soon.  So, some dorky child witnesses this atrocity and for some strange, unknown reason he wants to buy a good guy doll.  His mom goes to her favorite toy buying source, some ugly stinky HOBO!  Yes sir, I turn to hobos for my consumer needs as well.  Anyway, she buys a good guy doll from the old heffer and brings it to her overjoyed little squirt.  Soon after STRANGE THINGS begin to occur.  (Ex:  The boy asks if his doll can...WATCH THE 9'OCLOCK NEWS HOW SHOCKING!)  Anyway some people start dying and murder by murder they begin to realize that the hobo ripped them off...BIG TIME!  Some very scary stuff though in this movie.  A reccommended buy for anyone with even a remote interest in horror.  <br />Scariest Moment (thrill spoiler):  Catherine Hicks picks up the doll and looks in it's back only to reveal it never had batteries in it.  Then Chucky's head spins around and screams, &quot;I'm CHUCKY WANNAPLAY?&quot;  That scene made me turn off the movie for a while so i could relax.
B000003N7G|5.0|With this album Coltrane proved that jazz can be, and is, about more than just virtuoso chops and technique. The Spirit World and the inner pursuit of knowing oneself were not things to which most jazz and/or jazz musicians aspired to, previous to this album.<br />This album is a glorious &quot;first shot fired&quot; in the revolution of spirit-jazz. The music contained herein is at times meditative, at times swinging, at times mournfully rumbling, and always focused on the task at hand... communicating feelings to the listener.<br />This album is often compared to a later Coltrane album, MEDITATIONS. If you own that one and have found that it is too much for you, try this one. Both albums epitomize Coltrane's spiritual leanings, but while A LOVE SUPREME most often resembles some sort of humble prayer, MEDITATIONS most often resembles The Creator unleashing all of its fury upon those who dare to remain unhumbled in the presence of The Gods.
1567184855|4.0|Destiny of Souls awakened in me both an interest with and fascination for reincarnation.  The book consists of stories gathered from Newton's years as a therapist and paints a hopeful, balanced picture of the time between lives and the interconnectedness of the soul to all creation.<br />Throughout my reading of this book, my innate skepticism was rarely triggered.  It &quot;felt&quot; right, even though some of the specifics (like the emphasis on classrooms) seemed a bit hokey.<br />If you are interested in the study of life between lives and reincarnation, &quot;Journey of Souls&quot; should be first on your list.
0553573403|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am NOT a Robert Jordan fan. In my opinion, the characters are flat, it takes him four or five entire volumes to do a decent amount of character development, and the story never seems to go anywhere. That being said, A Song Of Ice And Fire (the title for this epic) blows The Wheel Of Time completely out of the water. You can almost imagine Jordan bowing down at Martin's feet to pay him homage...the setting is incredibly well-developed and fleshed out, every single character is unique and thought out, the story is well-paced, and it never seems to slow down. I can also happily report, being about halfway through A Storm Of Swords (the third book in the series) that it keeps getting better! Martin manages to shock his audience by never stooping in the quality of his work...the story continues to move along at a nice pace, and I just haven't been able to put these books down. One thing I should say however, particularly for the benefit of parents...in an effort to make the world of A Song Of Ice And Fire more realistic (an effort at which Martin succeeds on an unprecedented scale), the writer has included a significant amount of graphic, adult content...including incest, strong sexual themes, and violence often described in gory detail. This is not a complaint; I really thought that these themes only helped add to the story's effect (hey, war ain't pretty, folks), but I always think it's good that parents receive a 'heads-up' if they are thinking of buying this book for their children. All in all, an amazing piece of work, and a breath of fresh air for the fantasy genre. I would recommend it to anyone.
0385484518|3.0|My sister died when she was 20 and I was 16. She did not get any time to prepare for the end. It came instantly and left those that love her wondering why she had to die. Her death sent me into a tailspin that took over 5 years to recover from. In that time, I spent many hours pondering the very issues Morrie trumpets. I have read many &quot;carpe diem&quot; stories as well as many books on grieving. Yet none of them could fill the void nor lessen the pain. Only my faith has given me some measure of understanding. <br />So, I read this book looking for a new perspective on the process of dying and grieving. Or at least be inspired by a new seize-the-day victory. I do not feel I received either to the level I expected. When you put this story under the tacky, over-saturated lights of Ted Koppel's Nightline, it loses something. It becomes a spectacle instead of a testimony. I would have rather felt that Morrie spent his days enlightening all who would venture into his home. The fact that it became a big &quot;story&quot; bothered me. Though I know that his being on Nightline inspired many, I still wish he could have had the same impact far from the bleached-out glow of the media. <br />But beyond the lights, I kept waiting for Morrie to say that there was a reason for his horrible circumstances. He decided to make the best of it, which is an inspiration to us all. But what about the reason for it? I wanted to share with Morrie what I have learned over the past 14 years. Not that I am an authority on the subject, but to simply discuss with him the idea that there was a greater reason for his suffering than just helping others not fear death. There is a greater plan than our own. A plan we may not even be able to comprehend. We can curl up into a ball and hide, or we can shout from the highest rooftop. Morrie chose to shout from the Nightline rooftop, a very high one indeed. But what he was shouting lacked the power, the hope beyond this world. Morrie died not knowing what would be next. Instead of finding comfort in the end, he busied his mind with helping others to ease the pain of leaving. I applaud his bravery and his selflessness. I only wish that as he stopped to help others on his journey, he hadn't forgotten to ask where the journey was ultimately taking him. Please do not misunderstand me. I am no judge as to whether or not Morrie went to Heaven or Hell. It is not my place to determine. But, I believe we can know for ourselves. I wish Morrie had the reassurance that he was not only sharing this experience to help others, but to find peace in knowing that there is something greater beyond this life. Obviously, Morrie had different beliefs than my own. And I guess what I am saying is that I wish he had the hope I have. Some may call me arrogant and judgemental. But you see, mcuh the same as Morrie, I too want to tell the world that death is not the monster we make it out to be. <br />Read this book. Though I feel Morrie's journey ended a chapter early, I cannot speak enough of his decision to do everything he could to help others live their lives to the fullest. Each of us is appointed a time to die, and we should live our lives and love those around us as if that time were three months from now, or even tomorrow. Morrie was a brave and wise man. We should all face death with such bravery. <br />As I step closer to the day of my own death, it is my hope that I will not only have helped those I'll be leaving behind, but I pray that I will have done everything I could for the One that I am going to soon see.
B000002BUY|5.0|This Incubus album is arguably there best, and i feel the best way to review this album is by individually rating each of the brilliant 12 tracks on this CD.<br />Redefine-A funky, fast paced opener. Good lyrics, great scratches/samples by DJ Lyfe and some funky bass in the middle of the track. 8/10<br />Vitamin-One of the CD's best tracks. Once again Brandon's lyrics seep into your thoughts, while musically it shifts from mellow to heavy ending with a great climax.9/10<br />New skin- The song i have heard the most but it is still a favorite. Brandon's singing has great variety while the great drumming, heavy guitar riff and excellent use of samples/scratches makes this song something special. 10/10<br />Idiot Box- Not one of the best songs but still a welcome edition to this album. It starts off with a heavy riff and turns into another funky slab of trademark Incubus. 6.5/10<br />Glass- A good heavy song, Brandon's lyrics and vocals showcase his brilliant songwriting/singing ability, while the music is tight with the perfect balance and a mix of heavy and funky tunes.7/10<br />Magic Medicine- Features a fast, repetitve, manufactured drum beat with samples over the top. Okay for what it is but it doesn't grab me like the other songs. 5/10<br />A certain shade of green- Awesome guitar riff, twangy bass, great percussion and very good samples from DJ Lyfe. The lyrics are very well written. They also have a good video of this track. Definately a personal favorite. 9.5/10<br />Favorite things- Good variation on this track. The violins add a new flavour to the Incubus sound. 7.5/10<br />Anti Gravity love song- The song that is probably the most different from the other tracks. The guitar sound is amazing, saxophones are also used. It is the most mellow of tracks. 6/10<br />Nebula- From the CD's most mellow track to arguably its most heavy. Great lyrics, great chorus, and a very good climax, where the music is at its heaviest while Brandon laughs insanely over the top. 9/10<br />Deep Inside- Another track showcasing the great musical talent of the Incubus boys. A large part of this track is reasonably mellow, but towards the end it erupts with both Brandon's vocals and the music turning heavy. Good stuff. 9/10<br />Calgone- The last of the tracks is, like the first track a fast paced, catchy piece and an appropriate end to this brilliant album. The music is quite heavy while the lyrics are pretty humorous. 7.5/10
B00004U8H4|3.0|&quot;American Psycho&quot; is one of the most disturbing films I have seen all year. Christian Bale is frightening yet hilarious as the titular character Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street hot shot who indulges in his sick pleasures by night. He murders homeless people, prostitutes and even his own friends. Bateman is a character who feels nothing and cares about nothing save his own material possessions and outward appearance. &quot;American Psycho&quot; is much less gory than the novel on which it is based. Instead of being a straight horror film &quot;American Psycho&quot; wisely opted to be an original satire on the materialism of the 1980's. The film opens with a bang and possesses the same sick and funny energy until the end when it begins to lag a bit. But for the most part of the film I was interested in Patrick Bateman's tale. If you enjoy dark humor and have a strong stomach, I strongly suggest this film. It's not a film I would want to watch over and over again. It's not a classic, but it is still a good film.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|I thought this was a funny movie.  No, it was not a masterpiece... and yet, I was entertained consistently through the whole thing.  If you like to laugh and you are not weird about what you think is offensive (frankly--I didn't think there was anything offensive about it at all), get this movie and get a bowl of popcorn and get ready for some good sight gags, some witty take-offs of other type movies, and some amazingly good acting.  Come to think of it, the acting kind of bumped this movie up a level in my opinion. The players were all good.  They had fun, too--you could tell.<br />best,  jean
B00003CXE7|3.0|This was an entertaining movie but during the gladiator battles it was like watching the Blair Witch Project...very dizzing.  The camera would swing back and forth making it impossible to see what was going on. The story was good and cast of characters were put together well.  But I cant help but think the makers of this film were trying to give the viewer the same feel and intensity as Braveheart, which to me will go down as the best epic movie ever.  This film is good, but it is no Braveheart.
0553277472|4.0|Part road novel, part philosophy, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (&quot;ZMM&quot;) met with huge critical and commercial success when first published in 1974. Narrator and son ride from Minneapolis to San Francisco; meanwhile, both are haunted by the narrator's past insanity, brought about by his &quot;chasing the ghost of rationality&quot;. A series of philosophical monologues addresses questions both mundane - how to fix a motorcycle - and metaphysical.<br />Today ZMM retains a sizeable following, although criticism of it is very polarised: Pirsig's fervent self-assurance when dealing with philosophical questions converts some readers into &quot;followers&quot; and tends to exasperate everyone else. Mostly structured as a &quot;solution&quot; rather than an &quot;inquiry&quot;, as the title claims, ZMM's philosophy is too often accepted without question, and it is frequently and regrettably true that the more positive the review, the more philosophically naïve the reviewer. Nonetheless, this should not disallow ZMM from being considered on its own merits.<br />ZMM is not an introductory philosophy text, more a &quot;once-in-a-lifetime&quot; philosophical statement; the comparison has already been made with Hofstadter's &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;, and Hofstadter's description - &quot;a statement of my religion&quot; - could well describe ZMM, too. When one considers the motivation required to sustain Pirsig's long and solitary struggle in writing and publishing ZMM, the rhetorical fervour of his arguments becomes more understandable. Those who attack Pirsig as pompous or narcissistic fail to appreciate the degree of self-belief needed to complete such a highly individualistic work. So, we can certainly admire him for trying - but is ZMM any good?<br />Some of Pirsig's arguments rest uneasily, such as his blithe acceptance of scientific relativism; and in rejecting subject-object dualism, he paints himself into some peculiar corners, such as his disquiet at the lack of beer cans littering Crater Lake National Park. But there is much in ZMM that is good and thought-provoking, too, especially where education is concerned: all teachers should read this book. And even during his tougher metaphysical monologues, only the driest, most rigid mindset could fail to find Pirsig's rhetoric engaging. Here, his wild claims about the importance of his philosophical arguments are gently counterbalanced by his acknowledged previous insanity: Pirsig takes care to label them the &quot;ramblings of a madman&quot;, though not without a certain knowing irony.<br />ZMM is not just philosophy: it is also a fine piece of travel writing, and a history of Pirsig's teaching career. It remains a novel, however, and not an autobiography: whilst the events described did occur, subtle details have been changed. Most importantly, Robert Pirsig &quot;the author&quot; differs from the narrator, who in turn differs from his former personality (&quot;Phaedrus&quot;). The subtle conflict between the narrator's unifying philosophy, and the barely resolved tensions between narrator/Phaedrus and narrator/son, produces a fully intended irony. Criticism of the narrator is unfair and misguided when it is directed at the author.<br />Pirsig writes with great clarity. Well-structured sentences and careful use of italics give his writing great explanatory power, reminiscent, for this reviewer, of the biologist Richard Dawkins. We may not agree with Pirsig, but we are rarely in any doubt about what he means to say. Nonetheless, there are inevitable uncertainties at the core of ZMM, concerning reason and its limits. The antipsychiatric &quot;insanity as enlightenment&quot; nettle is never fully grasped, though one senses that this is Pirsig's belief; moreover, the analytic intractability of the Eastern philosophy that he embraces means that ultimately, the &quot;inquiry&quot; never reasons its way to an answer. Those seeking an absolutist metaphysical system will not find it here, and one can imagine Pirsig's sense of unease at becoming a latter-day religious guru.<br />ZMM is very much unique: four and a half years in the writing, but decades, one senses, in the germination. Fans will enjoy the 25 or so extra pages, cut from the original manuscript, available in DiSanto's &quot;Guidebook to ZMM&quot; - but skip the dreadful philosophy chapters. Pirsig wrote a sequel of sorts, &quot;Lila&quot;, in 1991, but its sour atmosphere and slack reasoning make it strictly for the converted. Evidently Pirsig coped badly with his post-ZMM fame: one can imagine the sackloads of witless fan-mail. Unquestionably, for this reviewer, ZMM can stand alone: a model of clarity in written argument, a fine American road novel, and an inspiring demonstration of one man's ability to think for himself.
0812589041|5.0|Good vs. Evil? Action and Plot? Aliens and Spaceships? Battlerooms and Politics? Yes, yes, yes and yes. But set aside the elements that make this book a fun piece of Sci-fi. The scenes that absolutely captivated me were the ones illustrating the many techniques Ender used to lead those around him. There were bullies, introverts, rejects, prodigies and even superiors (the adults) and Ender has to find a way to successfully lead them all. He chooses to physically punish some while treating others with kindness and understanding. He is a master teacher and born leader. Which is why he is the chosen to save the human race. While I enjoyed the action and the plot, it is the lesson in leadership that makes Ender one of my all-time favorite characters. Card has created a wonderful vehicle to carry a very worthwhile message - a message CEOs, managers and even the average Joe would do well to heed. <br />If you one day hope to call yourself a leader, in any capacity, read this book. Forget that it is sci-fi and appreciate it for what it says about social interaction and the enormous amount of wisdom and strength required to become a truly great leader.
B00004YKUX|5.0|Two things strike me about this album.   First, that great voice: it has more subtleties, shading, nuance, grace and drama to it than any 20 new artists today (and that's not necessarily a put-down of new artists, just a fact).  Second, his selection of material:  he makes some simply inspired choices of songs, and doesn't just sing them, he interprets them and reinvents them into something his own.  I think this trilogy, of which this is the third release, is destined to be a mile marker in American music.  And God Bless Johnny Cash, because he did it his way.
0812589041|5.0|Ender's Game will give you the same transported feeling of wonder.  Orson Scott Card is remarkable.  He has a smooth writing style and carves his characters with meaningful situations.<br />Plan on reading Ender's Game in a single sitting.  It's in my top five list.  Oh!...and it might be a good idea to have Speaker For The Dead available when you turn the last page on Ender's Game.<br />At this point I've read all the Ender books and I anxiously await the new one scheduled for release in Jan 2001 (tick tick tick tick).
B00004YA66|5.0|Yes, I'll say it again - the script is flawless! It is smart, consistent, silly at times but or-so-sweet, it is very well thought trough and most importantly, it respects the viewer. Some people say that the &quot;time travel&quot; part has holes in it and is not believable &quot;if you think about it&quot;. Well, if you really HAVE to think about it, then please do and this time use your imagination - you shall see that everything, even the ending makes perfect sense! Don't forget that nobody knows what time travel would really be like and so, unless you have your own hypothesis, take the film's premise and use it as a basis for you &quot;analysis&quot;. This was the most enjoyable movie experience I had in years. It is important to mention that I never mix up Movies and Art like many people do here, and this one being a very fine Movie and an exceptional entertainment gets 5 stars from me.
B000003BF4|5.0|....  This is the Rolling Stones at their absolute best, raw and agry.  Mick Jagger is in strong voice and Mick Taylor and Keith Ricahrds' guitars work together like a well oiled machine.  Most of the tracks are improvements or certainly interesting adaptations from the studio recordings.  The solos on Sympathy For The Devil and Midnight Rambler are just stupendous.  The backbeat drumming is just superb on Jumping Jack Flash, Honkey Tonk Women and most of the others.  Yes, Charlie was really good that night in MSG.  Truthfully the feedback issues just add to the raw, honest tone of the record.  Not only is this a top quality live recording but also a one that approaches desert island levels.
B00003CXE7|1.0|The effects maybe great but I couldn't stand watching all that voilence. I know it's a true story but they could have avoided showing all those heads coming off. It's a waste of time to watch this movie.<br />If it was bad for Rome to have it's people enjoy those gladiators killing each other, it is equally bad for movies if one enjoys watching all that violence.
B000002IKR|5.0|not as good as slayer,metallica(ride the lightning),early anthrax,early kreator but they are old school thrash.the legacy is their best offering.raging waters and c.o.t.l.o.d. are the best songs on this album but all are good. alex is a great guitarist and the rhythm guitars are ferocious.vocals are awsome, he sounds like a bear at times.a must have for older thrash.
B00004Y87I|5.0|When I first read the story of &quot;Walter Mitty&quot; in my Honors English class, I wasn't all that interested in it. However, when my teacher brought in the movie, Danny Kaye quickly became one of my favorite actors of all time! The movie got my cynical, freshman class (that usually doesn't laugh at anything except the local &quot;court jester&quot;, if you understand) laughing as well! I absolutely enjoyed the number when Mr. Kaye is recalling his old music teacher. I feel as though he was, no IS, a predecessor to another of my favorite actors, Ryan Stiles. I just turned 15 and I love this very talented actor and this very hillarious movie. I strongly suggest that you get your own children to watch the works of Mr. Kaye ASAP. His acting talent needs to be shared with everyone! (By the way, the Thurber story is very good as well.)
B000002HMH|5.0|OK.  Now most poeple considered Metallica sell-outs after this album was made.  But really, most of the people probably dont even know what a sell-out is.  A sell-out is when a band or solo artist or whatever does whatever their fans or followers want them to do to make themselves popular and rich.  This is were people get confused.  You see the majority of Metallica's fans love that super-fast tight sound.  They want Metallica to continue playing that same music, but Metallica does whatever Metallica wants to do.  This album is about feeling and pierces deep into the soul.  While most of the songs have a slower tempo then the previous albums, they are still just as powerful, if not more.  This album proves that big words arent needed to let feelings out.  So in the end, Metallica comes ever closer to exploring all the aspects of what music is. Sell Outs, I think not.
B000002540|4.0|This is another one of those that's seriously GROWN on me over the years.  When I first heard it, I was not as familiar with their early material, and this contains 3 songs from each of their first 3 albums.  Plus, I felt the sound quality suffered in comparison to SOME ENCHANTED EVENING and, later, EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIVE.  None of the tracks sound as good as the studio recordings.  But I no longer CARE about that!  What we have here is a non-stop overwhelming celebration of a band that has just completed their first &quot;era&quot; of creativity, recorded for posterity for those not fortunate enough to see them live for themselves.  And I find the CD far superior to the LP for simply eliminating the need to flip between 4 sides to listen to it in its entirety!  I must admit:  my favorite parts are the 3 songs that AREN'T on their studio albums!  &quot;Buck's Boogie&quot; has become one of my top fave BOC tunes (although, I feel the earlier recording on the 4-song LIVE IN NEW YORK set is better; hear the remastered version of that on WORKSHOP OF THE TELESCOPES!).  &quot;Maserati GT (I Ain't Got You)&quot; is a mega-reworking of a classic, which has also been covered by such acts as Molly Hatchet and The Blues Brothers (BOC's is my favorite, and it's my favorite track on this disc!).  And finally, Steppenwolf's &quot;Born To Be Wild&quot;, the ultimate biker anthem played here by a band who've done several of those in their time.  This was issued as a single, and I only wish the &quot;B&quot;-side was included here as a bonus, a much slower, &quot;spooky&quot; studio version of the same song;  see WORKSHOPS again to compare.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|with nothing interesting. The movie is too predictable and overdone. I still couldn't figure out why they named it &quot;Gone in 60 seconds&quot;.
B000002KAT|5.0|When I first received this CD, it was by accident.  I thought I ordered a different Van Morrison CD, with his more familiar tunes from the 70's.  But I popped it in the CD player anyway.  During the first 45 seconds of each song, I said blech and forwarded to the next track.  That was it.  Later I was in a mood to have a pity party for myself, bored and thought I at least should give it a better chance.  I am in love.  Whoever said it needs to be listened to in its entirety is exactly right.  It is not the same to listen to it a bit at a time.  I have to honestly say it is now in the top 3 of my most favorite albums ever and I never thought I could say that.  It is gorgeous and haunting and leaves you feeling differently at the end.  Some of the songs have brought me to tears.  And yes, it does go beautifully with a nice brandy or glass of wine (or two).  But even without that, an album that defies categorization or definition.  Get it.
0553573403|4.0|Martin has given us an ambitious novel with the first book of the Song of Fire and Ice series.  The plot is engaging, most of his characters are well developed, and the pacing of the novel is exquisite.  Readers of other epic fantasy series will be pleasantly surprised to find that Martin diverts from the typical &quot;farmer boy becomes hero&quot; fantasy epic. His story is smart, funny, and simply unlike the majority of fantasy on the market.  Readers who are looking for a sword and sorcery epic will be sorely disappointed; the novel is primarily concerend with the politics of Martin's fictional kingdom--magic takes a back seat to the intrigues of the court.  Though I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, my recommendation is not without some reservations.  While Martin has proved himself an able author, his writing still exhibits many of the qualities that plague authors of lesser talent.  He tends to over explain details rather than letting the readers imagination take flight and fill in the blanks.  A more talented and mature author would be able to direct the reader without unnecessarily explaining the leaps in logic or filling in between the lines.
B000006MS3|5.0|If I had to sum it up in one word, I would have to say that this album is, above all else, different. Kate Bush experiments with music and story, adding a taste of darkness and layering a myriad of experimental sounds into the music to create the richly woven tapestry of creative genius. From pressing the play button until the final echoes of the last track fade from the ear, the listener is immersed in a spellbinding display of songwriting and performance. <BR><BR> Each time I listen to the album, I hear something new. The music is so vastly different from the usual verse, verse, chorus, verse music that pervades the radio waves. The only bad thing about this album is that it's so good, I feel compelled to share it, but it's so different from anything else that it's hard to know if a person is going to be receptive to it. I like to listen to this album all at once, and let myself get carried away by it.<BR><BR> The music is powerful, compelling, and immersive. Leave your preconceptions at the door, and let Kate work her magic on you.
6305176299|4.0|At the begining i didnt know what to excpect but once getting into the movie i couldnt get off the edge my couch.This movie defintaly would have gotten a 5 star but i wasnt very impressed with the way Keana Reeves spoke his role.It was bland at some times.The excitement of the movie was great.Going through thcity steets down through the airport and ending up on the train.This movie has it all.I f you liked this movie i highly recommend fair game.It is a must have for any movie freak.
B000002G87|5.0|Since I first heard this album almost 30 years ago, it has remaned one of my favorites. I think it represents some of the best musicianship ever recorded in the blues rock genre. With out a doubt Clapton's finest record. Teamed up with Duane Allman, The two great guitarist drive each other too brilliance on every track. I have listened to this record probably a couple of hundred times and it is always great.This is a must have record for anyone who loves the blues.
0425152251|5.0|I had to read so many things for my philosophy's exams, and this book was my key to success. Although it resembles a philosophy text book, I spent a great time reading it. Gaardner covers the normal text book in an adventure/fiction scenario. The idea of the book is original, but it is extremely hard to write an idea like that. However, Gaardner makes it look easy! It just worked! Highly recommended!
0064407667|1.0|I am so glad that I read this book just before giving the set as a present! The first chapter or so and book description gave the impression of the kind of droll humor I love.  However, I actually found the contrast between the light tone and the sadistic aspects of the story disturbing.  Given the allusions to pederasty, and the torturing of a baby, I would say this book is wholly inappropriate for children, young adults, and anyone with any sensibilities.  Time to shop for a replacemnt present!
6302194296|3.0|A 1922 Dracula knockoff that became a benchmark. Directed by FW Maurnau and starring an actor using the assumed name &quot;Max Shreck&quot;.<br />Originally titled &quot;Nosferatu - Eine Symphonie Des Grauens&quot;,(but subsequently availible under a slew of psuedonyms, including &quot;horror of dracula&quot;) and possibly no longer availible in its original edit, this 1922 silent masterpiece ironically came closest to matching the context of Stoker's novel, even while it tried to change character names and plot details to prevent copyright infirngement (a sebsequent lawsuit almost saw the destruction of every existing copy, and henceforth it has been almost impossible to track down the original version.) The origins of some of the video released versions of Nosferatu are dubious. Most do not use the dark-tinting filter that the film was supposed to be shown with (hence, many scenes of Orlok creeping down alleys in the moonlight are revealed to be shot in broad daylight, and look absolutely ridiculous), and the questionable Republic Pictures version has altered narrative screens that refer to the vampire Orlok as &quot;Dracula&quot;, and to the hero as &quot;Jonathon&quot;).  The Film's greatest asset is shady actor Max Shreck's nightmare incarnation of the rat-faced Count Graf Orlok, with his long claws and piercing eyes, who remains one of the creepiest screen incarnation of Dracula ever. Almost any of the few scenes that feature him are directed with a magnificent omninence, and have been a benchmark for all film vampires to follow since.  Early uses of special effects (including, in some versions, negative film and stop motion effects), and of course the classic rigid-as-a-pole-rise-up-from-the-coffin scene that was  copied directly in Bram Stoker's Dracula. There are some laughable filming errors, and alot of silly overacting that ruins a few scenes. The dubbed soundtrack to the Republic Pictures release is truly awful, and probably not part of the original film.  Classic creepiness, but those without patience or an open mind will find this masterpiece dated.
0792424573|5.0|This book was such a great read! Any MJ fan can assure you that this is all truth and no bull since you hear it from the man himself. You find out about his personal life, his beginnings, his relationship with children and his severe loneliness. I definetly recommend this to everyone!
B000050XEI|1.0|This CD is a complete disappointment.  Every song sounds like a copy of previous songs.  There is a lack of true feeling in the compositions, everything sounds like a factory-churned out Enya product. Someone gave it to me as a gift and I listened to it at a coffeehouse as my friend studied.  I wondered why I got through the CD in such a quick amount of time. Was I so spaced out that an hour went by that quickly?? Then I read the other reviews on here and realized, it's only 34 minutes!!  Anyone who would rip off fans like that has lost my respect.  I'm heading for the used CD store to sell this one.
B00003CXDG|1.0|MI2 was so dull.  Maybe if I was a teenage girl I would be amused by Tom's grins.  He grins about his exploding Oakley's, he grins about how his boss found him on his &quot;vacation&quot;, he grins about the cliches of the movie, he is now grinning all the way to the bank. Let me put it like this, even the action was uninspired.  Perhaps the motorcycle chase was fun and creative (not a John Woo fan, but maybe this is recycled) for me, who does not operate high performance motorcycles, but certainly those who do would question the &quot;realism&quot; of those sequences. This movie is so damned sad.  Even the fashion is dull. Hey Tom, quit wearing Armani (or its similar breed).  Do you sleep in it?  Wear it to rake the leaves?  Change diapers?  Even Ving's talent is wasted on lines scripted on fashion.  He drops Gucci and Versace.  Like I care.  If I wanted to find Ethan Hunt I would look for the fashion model with no personality checking himself out in the bathroom.  Some spy. Here is a suggestion - if you want a faster moving spy movie where the characters &quot;get-it&quot;, spend your money on Goldeneye.  Brosnan wears better clothes, has more style and has dimension.  Also the DVD is packed with better goodies than MI2.  Unless you want to hear Tom talking about himself avoid MI2.
0440211727|4.0|A Time to Kill is a book that I enjoy reading. It is mysterious and had me on my toes all the time.  There are a lot of reasons why I was so interested in this book. Here is just some: The time of area was great. It made it more interesting being in that time than if it was in today's perspective.  The whole story got me guessing every moment of the way.  It kep me on the edge.  Kept me wondering throughtout the whole book.  The last reason is because I have always had interests in John Grisham's books. I would recommend this book to my friends and family.  It's a interesting book if u like drama and mystery.
B00003CXE7|2.0|After hearing all the hype about Gladiator, I was dissappointed to see it for myself ( DVD version ). I was told that the fight scenes were good, and they were, but the rest of the movie is just filler. There is almost no plot whatsoever, and what little there is is so incredibly predictable it's almost sad. The best part of the 2 disc DVD set is the real history of the gladitorial games on the second disc. Give this one a miss.
B00003CXE7|2.0|This movie has many inaccuracies (see: movie-mistakes.com) and a weak plot, definately no epic or contender for older 'sword and sandal' films. This one has it's moments, some good dialogue, the battle scenes are very engaging, but do not show what is actually happening in them, though I'm sure people who worked on the film know. I can't believe so many people like this movie. It is too long and boring. Watch TLC and A&amp;E instead.
B00000J6AG|1.0|People are saying that moby is like a god, that he is one of the world best producer, people say that his this record, Play, is the album of the year, ?. I have heard this is the best techno album ever. I cannot understand this things. Please forgive me, but in my view, Play is simply a bad album. The only thing moby has made, is sample some old soul vinyls, and put music behind. And believe me, that the only good things of this album are these voices, which are the only things moby has not made. The drums are simply bad produced, the music is simply, and his voice is, oh my god!, why anybody has say to moby that he cannot sign?. You could say me you like some of the album songs, but please, DON'T SAY ME THAT MOBY IS A GOOD PRODUCER AND DON'T SAY THAT PLAY IS ONE OF THE BEST 90's ALBUM!!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Why is it that when people see Fight Club, some think that the film endorses violence or anarchy? When you read Romeo and Juliet, are you supposed to think that violence solves life's problems? When you look at Guernica, do you think that bombings are beneficial to human life? <br />Fight Club is not an 'action' movie. It is a black comedy featuring social commentary and revolutionary visuals. It also features one of the greatest acting talents of our time, Edward Norton, as well as one of the most underrated actors, Brad Pitt, in a fantastic journey through the dark heart of american men. The cinematography, direction, sound and computer effects are all outstanding. They are beyond reproach. <br />Many complain about the plot. Well, it started as a novel, and it was quite consistent and faithful to the original. Others complain that the ending was unbelievable and ruined the movie. Well, this is simply unfortunate. I personally thought the ending was fantastic, and gave the film a second layer where before there was but one. If you dislike the ending, you probably did not allow the film to draw you in and surround you in its universe. This movie requires your full attention and an open mind.<br />If you require large explosions, naked women and extreme violence to enjoy a film, you probably won't like fight club. Ironically, the film does feature all three in varying degrees. But most importantly, the themes and opinions put forth in Fight Club are not necessarily those of the filmmakers. I'm sure David Fincher doesn't endorse murder or other depravity, but he felt it was important to include in the film to be faithful to the story. Don't persecute the film for its themes and mistake content for a message. Simply enjoy the world it creates and don't judge. The film certainly doesn't.
B000003CMB|5.0|Live at the Fillmore East, more particularly the latter three jam sessions, Hot'lanta, In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, and Whipping Post, are the most powerful musical moments of the 1970s. This is a band that had a full sound, using two drummers with a purpose, setting the rhythym with the great bassist Berry Oakley, and let its Blues show with Gregg Allman's organ. Dickie Betts is a very good guitarist, and Duane Allman made him and the rest of the band a huge talent. Duane's original strokes take him out of the rock and roll genre, and the power and verve of the music is far faster than blues and extended beyond the norms of Rock; Duane was a jazz instrumentalist in these jam sessions, exceeding the bounds of rock and the blues, although using them as springboards.     There are few bands that can hold the attention of its audience for the durations that the Allman Brothers did during these jam sessions, my favorite being In Memory of Elizabeth Reed. The arrangements are impressive as these men feed off each other's talents and created complex and powerful musical statements. I find that I have to look outside of Rock and the Blues to find anything as rich and with as much depth as Live at the Fillmore East contains, for this expanded my musical appetite and left me disappointed with rock musicians afterwards.
B00000K19E|5.0|It steals from many comic books, and may receive a lawsuit for that soon, but it's a greatly entertaining film, I can't wait for the sequels, to see Keanu, the superhero fly. You've gotta own this DVD.
0671027344|4.0|Man when I read this book, I bought copies for all my friends. Everyone loves it. It is the heartwarming and emotional story of a young boy who doesn't really &quot;fit&quot; in one real group, so he finds some friends and just lives his life. This book will make you laugh, cry, and flat out fall in love. You have to have it!
1564029654|5.0|.<br />Those big round staring eyes of an owl certainly strike a chord with most of us. Their almost human expressions seem to tell us that they are something special.<br />The three little owls in &quot;Owl Babies&quot; are certainly intelligent creatures. They soon realise when Owl Mother has gone she must be off hunting for food. Big sister Sarah keeps their morale high when doubts arise about their mother's safety. Little Bill can only say, &quot;I want my mummy&quot;.<br />When they begin to fear the worst (foxes loom large in their imagination) they close their eyes and wish Owl Mother would come home. Their faith is rewarded for soon &quot; softly and silently she swooped through the trees to Sarah, Percy and Bill&quot;. Isn't that great alliteration and imagery?<br />The pictures that accompany the story focus on the expressions of the three owl babies. Since it is night time we don't see much beyond the safety of their tree. The pen-and-ink drawings of our feathered friends are superb. Those droopy little pink beaks and big brown eyes have a strong plaintive appeal.<br />&quot;Owl Babies&quot; will be a rewarding book for all readers. The strong two-way bond between parents and children could not be better expressed.<br />.
B00003CXDG|1.0|Don't buy this movie, it's terrible. It doesn't get going at all until too late and the ending is boring, the plot sucks, the characters are weak, and Woo went wrong. Buy Face/Off if you want some cool flick, not this trash. People who liked it will hate it when they get older and see better movies, they'll wonder what they were thinking with these good reviews, Goldeneye, or Face/Off instead.
6305263299|5.0|First of all, let's get down on our knees and thank Anchor Bay for releasing this wonderful movie. Secondly, let me tell all of you that this movie introduced me to two people of whom I now feel passionately: Werner Herzog and Isabelle Adjani. Finally, on to my review. An enthusiast of vampire movies, I eagerly looked for this film at my local library after I read a review of it in the New York Times. My expectations were more than met. This film is beautiful. I love it. The cinematography, the music, the mood, and the production values are top-rate. The opening sequence is amazing. It more than implies that this is  a vampire film of rare ilk. Klaus Kinski is quite the man in this film. I wish I knew how he approached his role. Isabelle Adjani is gorgeous. Werner Herzog sounds everything off on the right note. I always enjoy watching this film. Explore the rest of Herzog's available work and you will not be disappointed. This tasteful film is a good one for the intellect, but the images and story go hand-in-glove, so don't expect a trashy, pretentious art film from Europe. Come with high expectations and you will not be disappointed.
B000002BVN|3.0|Ever since Jackson released THRILLER back in 1982, the albums after that seemed to get just that little bit worse every time, but that doesn't mean to say that BAD, DANGEROUS or HISTORY are terrible. They're still great albums overall.<br />However B.O.T.D.F. seems more like a quick cash-in rather than a chart topper.<br />This being Jackson's latest album, is probably not as 'bad' as you'd remember it to be. At first you think it's a bit boring, but having given it a second chance, you think of it as his best work since THRILLER. But have we lost the real Michael Jackson?<br />First off, the album contains five brand new songs and eight remixed songs from the previous album, HIStory, which was the main theme here.<br />Blood On the Dance Floor - probably the best track from this album. Good, solid rock and a fantastic beat!<br />Morphine - Given the chance, this an OK song, if seeming overlong and eventually boring.<br />Superfly sister - This song has its moments, but not very many compared to the rest of the song.<br />Ghosts - One of the best tracks on here. Here, Jackson tries to recreate THRILLER in a new guise and does pretty well! (This track was taken from Jacksons short film of the same name)<br />Is It Scary - Very very very VERY similar to 'GHOSTS', but alot louder and more of a beat. (This is also taken from the short film GHOSTS)<br />Scream Louder - About the same as the original, but you're likely to prefer the original.<br />Money - The original wasn't that good to start with, so don't get your hopes up for this one.<br />2 Bad - There's not much difference here compare to the original, but if you like that version, you'll like this one.<br />This Time Around - Different in how it sounds, but the same in how you feel about it.<br />Earth Song - Turns that classic love song we know and love into some sort of disco edit. One of the best remixes on here.<br />You Are Not Alone - What the hell was this?! This isn't a Michael Jackson song! This is part of the soundtrack to a Sonic The Hedgehog video game!<br />HIStory - Again, not that different, but OK...I suppose.<br />There have been very few albums by Jackson containing one or two songs we don't like, but this one bites the dust. If you're not all that sure, borrow it from a friend or a library for a few days and see what you think. If you're a serious Michael Jackson fan, then go and buy this album, it'll keep you going untill his new album in 2001. Though if you're not a fan, then this is not likely to convert you. If you don't already have a Michael Jackson album, then buy THRILLER or HISTORY.<br />This isn't a 'bad' album, but is this really what we'd expect from a man who released the biggest selling album of all time?<br />C'mon Michael! You can to better than this!
B00003CX8J|5.0|sorry about the title, I could not resist. This movie is so boss. All the characters are down perfect, like the comic book. The plot is smart, far smarter than Gladiator or M:I2, etc. Just a great film, experience it on DVD. The DVD doesn't have many X-tras but, it is decent, all about the film. Wolverine is a Canadian hero! And the X-Girls are hot
0553106635|5.0|Despite having compiled nearly 3,000 pages through the first three books, George R.R. Martin has yet to write a single insignificant sentence.  The story is so enormous that a less focused author would have produced an interminable set of volumes that readers had already lost interest in.  Similarly, a less competent author would have left out the little nuances and details that make the story so engaging.  In due time, this series will have a conclusion, and the conclusion will be neither rushed nor will it drag on.  The story is so tight that these inferior options do not exist.  Quite simply, Martin is producing a masterpiece.  <br />Unlike many other fantasy series today, the books in this series do not end on cliffhangers - a pathetic ploy used by authors and publishers to get readers to buy the next book, even though the bulk of the book may not have been very engaging.  Rather, the entire series is a cliffhanger, with the ends of each book coming to a satisfying temporary conclusion.  The characters weave in and out of the story from chapter to chapter, sometimes disappearing for 100 pages or more.  However, the reader never knows whether this particular chapter may be the end of the line for that character.  Because all characters are fair game to the headman's axe, and each character has both good and evil within, the book reads more like reality than a tale.  I never got the sense that everything would turn out alright in the end, no matter how dangerous the circumstances.  As in life, people die when situations become perilous.  Most everyone is both a hero and a villain.<br />The only current author in the genre that is on par with Martin is Guy Gavriel Kay.  However, their styles are so different that comparisons between the two cannot be made.  They each bring their unique brilliance to the genre, thus enriching the field for generations to come.
B00003CXE7|1.0|Honestly, it surpasses this flick by FAR.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|To be quite frank, the Beatles were always a better album band than they were a singles band. Despite racking up an impressive string of number one hits, the brilliance of this band would not be realized until 1966 with the release of the &quot;Revolver&quot; album. That said, the first half of this disc is dispensible, covering a period when the Beatles were catering to the teenyboppers with cookie cutter pop tunes the likes of &quot;She Loves You&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;. Songs like &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;, &quot;Ticket To Ride&quot; and &quot;Help&quot; were standard soundtrack filler and are mediocre when compared to their late sixties output. The album suffers immeasurably from the absence of any songs from Sgt. Pepper or the White Album and a scant two tracks from Abbey Road. The Beatles have never been served well by compilations and this album is no exception. Buy Abbey Road or Sgt. Pepper first for a more satisfying introduction to the band.
B000000OUE|5.0|This as the title suggests is the perfect CD(for a metal head). I love this CD becaause all the songs on are great. Some are awesome some just stick in your head. Creature of the Wheel and Real Solution #9 are 2 of the heaviest bass songs on this fab CD. More Human Than Human the first released single from this CDis awsome (they cut it apart on the radio, editing sux!) Blood, Milk, and Sky is like Spiders on System of a Down's CD it's slow and a bit more quiet than the rest of the songs but it still rox! The two Electric Head songs are great songs to bang your head to, and Grease Paint and Monkey Brains is a strange song about pedophiles but I'm not sure, it still is an awesome song. Now if you are some goody-good-where-is-my-bible-at kind of person then this is not for you, it is rather goth-ish. Super-Charger Heaven is an example of that, you can't tell what Rob's saying, but if you check the lyrics on some site it is a little sac-religious. El Phantasmo and the Chicken Run Blast-O-Rama is also a very cool song and catchy. Blur the Technicolor, I'm not sure but I think it is on one of the Ace Ventura movies its a song that sticks in your head easily. And then if there could be a title track it would be I, Zombie and awesome display of hard metal. The reason i say it would be the title track is the Chorus is AAAAAAAAAAAASTRO: TWOOOOOOOOOOOOTHOUSAND. Well thank you if you read this review. I love this CD and I hope you do.
B000002534|3.0|I really believe that this review 'panel' is a bit worked up over this album. I have over 25 Santana albums in my music collection and I would have to say this album recieves the least airtime. Many of the reviewers find the last few tracks on Borboletta meditative which I find surprising given the harsh almost over-blown tone of the saxophone.These last tracks are pretty much saxophone solos and I find them so 'disturbing' that I usually skip them.There is one song on this album that I think should be on a Greatest Hits album ; that being 'One With The Sun'.As it has some nice singing by Leon Patillo and some nice guitar from Santana.Other pieces that I rate up there ,include Practise What You Preach and Mirage.
B000002GY9|5.0|Could be his best work of all.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is very certainly not Pink Floyd's finest achievement. However, it is still very impressive, and I think it still deserves five stars. By this point in the band's career, Waters had taken all creative control, which is, at least in my opinion, not a good thing. <br />Animals is a rant against society in general, and three aspects in particular. The two tracks that are the exceptions to this are &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot; #1 and #2. They're both very short, each clocking under two minutes, but they're pretty and the second one manages to set and optimistic tone after a very bitter album. And, along with that, Waters admits that he falls into the catagory with the dogs! <br />The three songs in the middle (Dogs, Pigs, Sheep) are all long, and are all mocking three classes of people. <br />&quot;Dogs&quot; is about the power hungry, ruthless leaders. It starts out with an almost pop introduction, but by the end has settled into something that sounds like a cut off of &quot;The Wall&quot;. It has a standered, Wall-esque guitar part, and uses synthesizer and sound effects to create a very gloomy mood. <br />The next track, &quot;Pigs,&quot; is about the bourgeoisie. It is in three parts, each representing a different aspect of the bloated upper middle class. The actual music in the song is very well thought out, and Water's singing is brillant. <br />The fourth track, &quot;Sheep&quot; is about the mindless masses who are exploited by the dogs. It has an upbeat tune that I don't like that much. However, it gets the point across, and ends the ranting section of the album nicely by having the exploited overpower the exploiters. And then, after the second &quot;Pigs on the Wing,&quot; the album closes. <br />Animals is not Pink Floyd's greatest album, but it's not bad at all. It also manages to show the direction that the band would take in &quot;The Wall.&quot; Anyway, buy it!
B00000IGGA|5.0|The finest album of the 90s.
0385495323|5.0|What great reading! I hope Singh comes up with a second book, he says that there were a great number of stories which he left out because there just wasn't room. The stories he used this time were so interesting. <br />Singh calls this a book on the evolution of codes and he presents it as that - showing the various developments of ciphers and codes from Caesar right through history including Mary Queen of Scots, Enigma &amp;c. to today. His explanations are so simple - stripped of too much technical jargon to make those of us who aren't had no ideas about codes and codebreaking before (like me) - don't feel thick and inadequate.<br />I first heard this book read in chapters on the radio, and that was pretty good stuff  - the book is so much better though. Singh is a great writer, I loved his initial scene setting with Mary, Queen of Scots. This book isn't just about codes, Singh also tells the story about the deciphering of various old ancient texts.<br />All the chapters flow on well from one another in the evolutionary way he describes - but you can read each chapter independently if you just want to browse through the book reading for a particular interest.
0060273224|5.0|Sabriel was one of the best books I've ever read. I stayed up all night reading it because I just couldn't put it down. Garth Nix is a very original writer. I had never heard of him until now. I bought the book because of it's unusual cover. Nix has a very unique style of writing you don't see much. There were hardly any of those dull moments in this book; the kind where it goes on and on with description. It reads like a nightmare, which keeps it interesting. There's always a new challenge the doesn't seem to be resolved until the next page, which keeps you turning. As for being called &quot;young adult&quot;, I don't know where they came up with that. This definatly could be enjoyed by children and adults alike. I'm very anxious for a sequel, but in the mean time I'll be reading some of his other books. To make a long paragraph short, you need to read this book!
0679879269|5.0|First of all, DON'T read this book if you haven't read the first two. Secondly, DON'T read it if you can't handle emotion. This book, though it may have plot holes, is poignant and moving, and I thouroughly reccomend it. Today, I fell asleep in Math class because I was up until four in the morning crying over the end. You will love it if you've loved other Pullman works, especially the Sally Lockheart trilogy. Just expect many, many surprises.

B00004YW6I|5.0|although everyone's free to think and write whatever he(she) wants, i do hate to see in your reviews this mechanical and egoistical approach to recordings of any musician, who works in the way that polly jean harvey does.   sound, names, commerce .... don't you feel that she just sings her life? you can either appreciate it, or simply listen to something else.                                perfect_album.                                                                      if i only could explain it all in english.
B000050IMG|2.0|This was a poorly made movie.  Yes is had comedic moments, but the unnecessary sexual implications were overbearing!  I don't ever want my kids to see this movie.  Hey Hollywood wake up and don't waste your money!!
B00000JXV7|5.0|That's the point of this movie--2 people who shouldn't be together, but who teach each other something along the way while also learning a lot about themselves. <br />Why is it that every time Sandra Bullock goes beyond the cutesy &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; format (which I admit to loving), she cops it? She's fantastic as the likeable Sarah who doesn't see just how likeable she is, and learns to accept herself during the journey. Ben Affleck is a stiff? He's *supposed* to be, and that adds value to the film, especially his embarrassment at having to peel 'Sarah' off the floor of a K-Mart they're sheltering in. And then there's the striptease in the gay bar--gorgeous.<br />Obviously I was looking at it from a different angle, because I thought Bullock &amp; Affleck had a lot of chemistry going on and played off each other nicely. Combine that with a great support cast, especially Steve Zahn as Affleck's best friend, and Moira Tierney as his fiance, and you've got a great, fun flick. It deserves 5 stars for recognizing that there will always be temptation--how we chose to deal with it is the ultimate test of character.
0385484518|5.0|Tuesday&quot;s With Morrie is a great book.  I really enjoyed reading it although it made me cry.  I think that Morrie is such an admirable character &amp; really helps you see just what is truely important in life. I also think that many of us can relate to Mitch, we often get so caught up in things that we often forget what is reaaly important. There are many important lessons that can be learned from this book, one of which is that we all need the help of others at some point in our life &amp; that is nothing to be ashamed of. Anyone can relate to this book, it deals with issues that a majority of us will experience in our lifetime.
B000000WA4|5.0|MC&amp;TIS Has become one of my absolute favorite albums. It is a creation on the level of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; &amp; &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. A rock classic, a work of great modern music. From the 'meloncholia' of the title track &amp; it's companion piece &quot;Tonite Tonite&quot;, the raging rock of &quot;Jellybelly&quot; &quot;Zero&quot; &quot;Where Boys Fear To Tread&quot; &amp; &quot;XYU&quot;, the gentle balladry of &quot;Here Is No Why&quot; &quot;By Starlight&quot; &quot;33&quot; and &quot;In The Arms of Sleep&quot; to the dreamy Alice-In-Wonderland prog-scapes of &quot;Porcelina of the Vast Oceans&quot; and &quot;Thru The Eyes of Ruby&quot; this is an epic-scale tour-de-force, perfect in every way. Keep rockin' Billy!!!
B000002H97|5.0|This was the CD that first introduced me to Metallica and you can't start with anything better.  Their muscial range is truly astounding.  From the raw fury of &quot;Wherever I Roam&quot; to the simple melody of &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; to the deep issues of &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, Metallica demonstrates a facility for hard rock that few attain and none surpass.
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|Scary Movie is a great movie (that's the only reason I give it 2 stars) I bet you all know the storyline so I won't bore you any further. Now, the big letdown with this disc is that you don't get the whole movie.. I know about at least one scene which has been edited. The &quot;Helpless cheerleader&quot;-scene has a vital thing missing.. You don't get to see her guts beeing ripped out. I have seen the scene in all of it's g(l)ory and believe me, you DO wanna see this. Now, give me an uneditet Scary Movie and I'll pay as much as they want.
0767849493|5.0|Kevin Smith writes great dialogue and this movie is no exception.  The religious content makes you think a little bit, but for the most part you'll be laughing, provided that you take the digs Smith takes at the Catholic Church and Christianity in stride.  While I felt the movie dipped a bit in quality at the end, overall this is one of the funniest movies of the year.
0375703764|3.0|I heard a great deal of hype about this book when it came out so I got interested (proving that advertising and word-of-mouth really does work).  When I finally got around to reading it, I was both captivated and repulsed.<br />The House Of Leaves is a complicated book.  My compliments to the author for managing to arrange it in such a fashion.  But this works both for and against the book.  The basic premise the author came up with is a fascinating one - a house that is larger on the inside than it is on the outside (a kind of residential TARDIS).  And if the author had just stuck to that element of the plot, I believe it would have been a much more rewarding read.  Instead he frames this story inside another...and perhaps another depending on how you read it.  The author augments the basic story line with the story of the life of Johnny Truant and  how he came to intercept the manuscript that describes the dimensionally-challenged house.<br />There were too many instances in which I became bored by the recounting of Johnny and his troubled life.  And too many times in which I began to think that the author was attempting to keep too many balls in the air at the same time.  Most of all, I was so intrigued with the portion of the plot about the house and its investigation, I became even more disinterested in those parts that seemingly had no connection.<br />All-in-all, Danielewski did an admirable job putting this book together.  The way in which it was arranged is truly unique.  The layout aides in conveying the horror and confusion of the events of the novel.  However, I can't help but think there was a little too much reliance on technique and not enough on good story telling.  I do, however, look forward to his next work.  I'm sure it will be something completely original and compelling.
B00000DGUM|4.0|Having seen the new Bach-less Skid Row on tour, I can tell you it's just not the same without Sebastian's trademark wail.  This album presents a pretty decent cross section of Bach's most well known numbers.  If you find yourself nostalgic for the way Skid Row used to be, this is a good album to get.
B00001ODHJ|3.0|My favorite movie, but I'm not buying the DVD until it has a commentary.  Thats the best part of any DVD.
B000050XEI|3.0|I can only repeat what others have said here.  It's a nice CD, but it<br />is shockingly short.  Especially after such a long hiatus between<br />releases.  People said Sting was pretentious for releasing a 2-CD,<br />&quot;Nothing Like the Sun.&quot; However, Mr. Sting (?) at least gave<br />us our money's worth.  At the end of the LP age, Sting released enough<br />material to fill a CD, even if it meant the LP version would extend<br />past the medium's capacity.  Now we have Enya releasing a recording<br />only 34 minutes long, on a medium that can hold more than twice that.<br />I'd call that a bit pretentious.  And not very respectful of her<br />legions of fans.<br />And what is the deal with the Latin chanting<br />stuff?  I never have understood that.<br />She could also do a little<br />less of the pizzicato-sounding keyboard.  Gets tiresome.<br />But<br />otherwise, I'm glad I bought it...
B000001DYY|5.0|Like many in my generation (born in '69), I was first captivated by TFF's &quot;Songs From the Big Chair&quot; when I was in high school. I listened over and over to that record and to &quot;The Hurting&quot; as I dwelled on my own unhappy childhood. I eagerly awaited &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; release when in college and was mostly happy with that effort. TFF's growth musically seemed to parallel my personal growth as I approached adulthood.<br />The first time I put on &quot;Elemental,&quot; I was blown away! I already knew Orzabal was a potent lyricist. It was now clear to me that he was a true musical genius as well. It also seemed obvious that Curt Smith had been holding him back considerably on the &quot;Seeds&quot; album. Sadly, the childhood friends had to part ways in order for Orzabal to produce this near-masterpiece. <br />While the advent of the C.D. as a music format has given us fantastic audio clarity, it has changed the way I and, I presume, most others listen to music. I rarely listen to an entire album anymore; rather I use the skip button or program features to play my favorite tracks. &quot;Elemental&quot; is one of the few exceptions, an album that demands to be played start to finish everytime. While &quot;Break it Down...&quot; holds its own as a single, it is primarily a hook tossed out to lure one into the album as a whole. It also serves as a transition piece for those of us who liked previous TFF material. <br />Sonicly, this album is all ear candy. It is a slickly produced modern symphony of guitars, keyboards, and drums, all wraped in Rolands alternately delicate and soaring vocals. He backs himself vocally on most tracks to great effect; Curt Smith is never missed. Many tracks seguay (sp?) musically into the next, creating the the sense of a journey more than a group of songs. Orzabal's usual high level of poetry is present in the lyrics as well. The obviously painful split with Smith serves as inspiration on several tracks, as others here have pointed out. He also gives insight into his strugle to reconcile the public's perception of him and his perception of himself, as he does in this piece from &quot;Cold,&quot; <br />-&quot;She saw me on the television underneath the sun. [obvious reference to &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot;] Thought I was warm like a mother, lover, brother. Brothter she was wrong.... Seems she thought of me as some mystic, fatalistic, mystical guru. Me, I haven't got a clue.&quot; <br />The journey begins with the title track, opening with a drumbeat reminicent of &quot;The Hurting&quot; which melts into the background behind Orzabal fairly shouting &quot;Welcome to the real world!&quot; Its as if he is telling us that &quot;Everbody Wants to Rule the World&quot; is an ideal that doesn't fit with the reality of adulthood. The journey continues through several songs, alternating pace, with nary a weak link save for maybe &quot;Dog's a Best Friend's Dog.&quot; Momemtum builds to the fabulous climactic eighth track, &quot;Power.&quot; Orzabal washes the listener with wave after wave of his own sonic, vocal, and lyrical power, building a steady tension. Without warning, he shifts to the beautiful and etheral &quot;Brian Wilson Said.&quot; Within three minutes, he has melted away the tension and set us back down to earth. He then sends us home with the final track, &quot;Good Night Song.&quot; To my ear, Roland has never sounded so good as he does here. Ironicly, the lyrics proclaim:<br />-&quot;My voice is aching; I'm tounge tied; the sounds we are making are so uninspired.&quot;<br />This song seems to be not just a fairwell to the listener, but the the TFF of the past as well. Luckily, my fear that it might signal the end of Orzabal's recording career was wrong. He went on to record again. If you are looking for more &quot;Shout&quot; and &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World,&quot; you won't find it here. If you like &quot;The Seeds of Love,&quot; however, you will probably love this ablum. &quot;Elemental&quot; was a real turning point for Roland Orzabal. On previous albums, he had confronted his past (&quot;Big Chair&quot; and the &quot;Hurting&quot;), and confronted social issues while dabling in sonic atistry (&quot;Seeds&quot;). On &quot;Elememtal,&quot; he honed that artistry while confronting the immediate conflicts of his then current life, apparently finally willing to let go of his past. Sadly, it was not much of a comercial success; &quot;Elemental&quot; was lost in the sea of the prevailing &quot;grunge&quot; movement of the time. However it has aged well. Seven years on, it still sounds great without sounding dated. It is a soothing soul clensing experience for me, and vindication of my loyalty to TFF through the 1980s and early 90s.
B00003CXE7|3.0|Looking at the sheer no. of reviews generated by this movies indicated that the movie is popular, at least in the commercial sense.  I always suspect everyone talks about this movie just because there has been no such kind of movie released for a long time. But it actually reminds me of &quot;Spartucus&quot; played by Kirk Douglas 40 (wow!) years ago.<br />Same as Spartucus, Maximus represents the figure (or was he a hero?) struggling against the established regime.  The story portrays Maximus (played by Russel Crowe) as a tragic person rather than a hero.  As a noble general (he has a closed relationship to Ceasar and an affection of Caesar's daughter Lucilla), Maximus lacks the same charisma as Spartucus, though he may be fiercer.  He can fight and win battle after battle.  But fate determines that he is the enemy to the heir of the dying Caesar, Emperor Commondus (played by Jaoquin Phoenix).<br />The movie does convey the good and evil between the two persons vividly, not unlike Ridley Scott's prior movies (Aliens). But then again, this is somewhat simplistic in Scott's world: there is only two sides, good and evil, and the good will always win the eternal battle against the bad in the end.  Not many would agree this in summation.<br />In the 60's, a movie like this would be called &quot;epic&quot;, &quot;grand&quot;.  Nowadays, everybody knows everything &quot;grand&quot; in the movie is digital: the Germania battle, the Arena, the people..... You won't really get the feeling that you were there.  You are just watching a movie, if not a cartoon.<br />Gladiator is not a bad movie, but certainly not one of the best. You know this movie lacks something.  It is sometimes superficial, sometimes intrigued.  You have a mixed feeling and you are not sure whether you like it or not. To the Lisa Gerrard's fan, the soundtrack may be a consolation.  To the Scott's fan, they may look the &quot;Aliens&quot; again because Emperor Commondus is no Alien.
B000002572|5.0|Every once in a while, you've gotta review the classics.  This is a great, solid album, filled with catchy lyrics, heavy riffs, and plentiful melody.  I am only 17, but I know good music when I hear it, and this is good music!  All eight songs are great.  &quot;Peace of Mind&quot; has been one of my favorite songs since I was like eight or nine.  If you love rock and roll, you will love this album.  The guitar work is great, too, at times there are two guys soloing at once, which you don't hear very often.  Aside from the fact that these guys were really goofy-looking at this time (in the picture on the back, one of them has a 'fro bigger than his head!), they really know how to play.  I think my two favorite '70s rock bands are Black Sabbath and Rush, but these guys come in third.  Very few albums of the time could compete with this one.  No matter what generation you are from, you should definitely check this one out.

B00003CXIY|3.0|This is one of the films from the summer of 2000 that actually made me laugh, intentionally. I am not saying that this film is anything more than what it is, but it is worth a look see. The lowbrow film genre has been pushed to the extremes, thanks primarily to the Farrelly Brothers. This film tries to steal some of that thunder, but gets a little lost on the way. There were parts that made me laugh pretty hard, then there were the parts that you could tell they wanted us to laugh, but the laughter just was not coming. See it for the big laughs, but the rest of it is just filler in between the next big joke.
B00000IPAX|4.0|Everyone's raving on about how horrible this album is, pure pop, they sold out, blah blah blah, that's all a bunch of crap. Yes, it's poppier than their older stuff. Yes, this the album that propelled them to MTV stardom? But who cares? This has some great songs. Wendy Clear, Anthem and Going Away To College are some of their best. Please, don't call yourself a Blink fan if this is all you have. And this shouldn't be your first Blink CD. Pick up a copy of Dude Ranch instead. But it's worth having to complete your collection, and for some great songs.
B00004W50Z|5.0|Published reviews of this album are perplexing to me.  Do people compare this album to their first two masterpieces, or are they reviewing the album by itself, comparative to everything else that came out that year?  In my opinion the mixed reviews that it was gotten are due to people comparing it to their earlier work which must not be, and cannot be done.  The supposed decline in quality from The Band to this is overly exaggerated.  This album is still better than almost anything else recorded at the time and is simply a joy to listen to.  That being said it is a much more straightforward and less complex album than its predecessors yet this does not make it any less enjoyable to listen to.  For the most part the songs are all sung with one lead vocal, with little harmony in the mix.  The album kicks off with Strawberry Wine a very up tempo rocker cowritten and sung by Helm.  This moves into Sleeping, an absolutely beautiful Richard Manuel song that almost makes me cry listening to it.  Another beautiful song on the album is All La Glory a childish lullaby type song sung by Helm that is one of my favorites.  There are many more &quot;rock&quot; songs on this album than on any other Band album in my opinion.  Time to Kill, Just Another Whistle Stop and The Shape I'm In are all heavier than most of their songs and the closest the Band got to sounding like anyone else.  Stage Fright, in my opinion the best song on the album, will always be one of my favorites.  The Rumor is actually the only song on this album that I don't consider to be great.  The playing on this album is still impeccable even if the arrangements aren't as complex.  Both Hudson's organ and Robertson's guitar are much more prominent.  There are more guitar solos on this album then on their first two albums combined and Hudson's organ also becomes the lead instrument more often, notably on The Shape I'm In.  Danko uses a fretless bass on the whole album which is quite interesting.  The horn arrangement on W.S Walcott Medicine Show is a real treat as well.  Overall I think the down home country feeling is still there although the songs have become more on their own than put together. which is by no means a bad thing.  The wide range of instruments remains, and Robertson's songwriting is still effective.  This remastered version contains far less than the rest of the albums but this is no reason to not go right out and pick this up.  Stage Fright is a true masterpiece, an album that deserves to be listened to and valued based on the music that it contains, not on what came before it.
B000001G1E|5.0|I can't imagine a better summation of funk than this set.  I saw James Brown live a few years ago -- before that I really didn't know much about him, associating only &quot;I Feel Good&quot; with him -- and immediately went out and picked up this boxed set.  Since then I have only come to love it more (especially discs 2 and 3); this is the bible of boxed sets.
B000002J2D|5.0|And Then There Were Three, A wonderful Cd..that intensifys the musical talent of Phil Collins,Mike Rutherford, and Tony Banks.  This Cd is the first Cd with just these 3 artists..I was surprised how great this Cd was I had forgotten that there were only 3 people in the group it sounded like the original 5 but just with phil singing.    This Cd is great including Genesis' first top 10 hit &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot;  and it has another great song &quot;Down and Out&quot;.  Showing Tony Banks talents at keyboards and Phils Drums and Especially Mikes guitar work...it is the beginning of the great Genesis..which broadened the audience and musical pieces of this group.
B0000033OT|5.0|Donny Hathaway was an amazing talent.  This is my favorite album by him, and I own and love all of his albums.  Absolute brilliance from a musical genius.   If you love soulful music, you should not be caught without this recording in your collection.  Calling this album a &quot;masterpiece&quot; would not suffice to summarize its greatness!
B00000IPAX|2.0|Hey, I have to say that this album is the worse of the Blink 182 guys ! When I bought this record I was very happy but when I put it in the sterio sounds like Britney Spears (not really). Seriusly this guys become pop! If you wanna hear the true punk check out Dude Ranch (It's awsome) or Chesire Cat.
B000001EGE|3.0|The compositions on this albums are among his best - generally more distinct, creative and diverse than his 80's and 90's releases.  Highlights are the two singles, &quot;Rocket Man&quot; and &quot;Honky Cat&quot; and the glorious ballad &quot;Mona Lisas and mad hatters&quot;.  The music is quite diverse, incl. the gospel-tinged &quot;Salvation&quot; and one song, &quot;Slave&quot;, that reportedly was an attempt to write a song in the style of The Band.  The problem is that some of the performances sound rather forced (also a problem om his earlier releases IMO).  EJ tends to sing on the top of his voice, and the playing lacks the freedom and naturalness they managed on his masterpiece &quot;Goodbye yellow brick road&quot;.  Especially &quot;I think I'm gonna kill myself&quot; sounds terribly forced.  With better performances I would have rated this 4 stars, as it is it's only worth 3.
B00000IQW0|3.0|I loved Battlestar Galactica with a passion when I was young, like I loved Star Wars before it- obviously Galactica would never have happened without Star Wars.  Many of the scenes, effects, and concepts are lifted straight from the George Lucas movie.  Seeing it over twenty years later is a real eye-opener. The acting is wooden and the line reading is often comically bad- among the major characters, only Lorne Greene, Dirk Benedict and Jane Seymour were good (and Seymour's character got killed early in the series, unfortunately).  Some of the worst things of the era in which it was released appear here, including Rick Springfield, the hairstyles, and disco music (in the casino scene, a direct rip-off of the cantina scene in Star Wars-even the subtitles acknowledge that it is &quot;disco&quot; playing). There is a high cornball content- the scene where the robot dog destroys a Cylon warrior is worse than the Ewoks battle scene in Return of the Jedi.  There are good special effects-the radiation field/minefield scene is great, but this isn't a movie that's worthwhile just for the eye-candy, like say, Barbarella.  It doesn't even hold up as well as other cheesy childhood favorites like Land of the Lost and Lost in Space.  One of the funnest things about owning the DVD is that you can freeze and blow up the &quot;F--- Off&quot; spelled out in lights in one scene where the planet Caprica is getting bombed.  Still, I can't say I totally regret buying this.  I still like the sets, the costumes, the actress who played Athena (what a fox!), and the premise of the show is interesting. And the Colonial Vipers were way cool. Too bad the show degenerated into that horrible &quot;Galactica '80&quot; fiasco.
0380729407|2.0|Many high schools cover this book in english classes, and though I hadn't read it in school, I've always been fond of Bradbury's short stories, so I figured I'd give it a read.  I was fairly disappointed.  It doesn't match his short fiction.  I found the plot and characters dry and predictable.  Maybe I just don't like carnies...
0785918736|5.0|This book was great!  I haven't read Roald Dahl's other adult books, but they're probably just as good.  It's a collection of short stories with a twist at the end.  My favorite would be Georgy Porgy, if I remember the spelling correctly.  That ending was so twisted, I'm still trying to figure it out.  Anyways, I recommend this book to people who love weird stories.  Hope you enjoy.
6300182355|4.0|I am not saying that &quot;Star Wars&quot; does not deserve a place in the museum of sci fi videos, but the movie is too simple of a good versus evil conflict covered with special effects. &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; is not exactly the drum I march to, but I have to give credit where credit is due. The story starts with a normal everyday man being thrust into an unusual situation that involves the fate of the planet earth. (A little beyond plausibility, but this fault is easy to overlook seeing what a great movie it is.) When he realizes what is going on, he uses the knowledge he knows (football knowledge) to his advantage. (So instead of a superhero, we have a normal man who uses what knowledge he knows. Excellent!) Ming is frighteningly evil, but yet, he carries a charm, and at times he is even likable. Ming's daughter shows a common human weakness well. (Her sexual desires govern her decisions.) Allright, the effects are overdone sometimes, but that fault is easy to forgive seeing that the story is rich and complex. Ming's victims oppose both Ming AND EACH OTHER. Flash realizes that the only way to defeat Ming is to join all the different factions together. So Flash has to go through the long and painful process of making peace with the different factions AND THEN getting them to work together. (It is interesting that before Flash, the doctor, and Dale were thrust into space, they had disputes themselves. This actually prepares us for the rest of the plot.)  Because of Flash's dilemnas, the suspense rarely drops. Comic relief is also well placed. So we have a normal everyday man thrust into an extraordinary situation; he has to use what knowledge he has to his advantage; he faces pure evil; through a painful process he gets different factions on his side; he gets them to work together; and the final fight between good and evil starts. &quot;Star Wars&quot; may have a greater reputation, but if you ask me, this is the better movie.
630024797X|5.0|This is an amazing film! (Not for those interested in explosions and fast cars, etc.) I can't praise Kinski and Stanton highly enough. I watch this film about once a year. There's one scene that's about as (psychologically) intense as anything in film.
6302794331|5.0|I thought this was perhaps the best adaptation of the Dickens' tale yet. First of all, Micheal Caine delivers a wonderful performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. He plays along wonderfully with his co-stars. The Muppets themselves, especially Gonzo as Charles Dickens and Rizzo the Rat as himself, are equally wonderful. They have the Muppet zest, freshness and vitality featured in &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. The music is very good too, and most of the songs are quite memorable. All in all, I beleive this may be my favorite Christmas movie.
6305718954|1.0|There's been enough commentary for both sides of this film.  I would have to agree that it is gravely misinformed when it comes to &quot;lost gospels&quot; and the real intention of the Catholic Church.  I assure you that the Catholic Church's intention is not to &quot;hide the truth&quot; from us common folk; and I also assure you that the Church does not accept &quot;lost gospels&quot; because they show evidence contrary to the Church's belief, and in turn, the Church is in fear of its inability to stay in &quot;power.&quot;  Investigations on these new findings (such as the gospel of St. Thomas, the Dead Sea Scrolls-which have been deemed authentic by the Catholic Church, the book of Mormon, etc.) are done with incredible and tedious detail and are deeply analyzed.  So, for the Church not to recognize the authenticity of a lost gospel means that they specifically found something that suggested it was not real.<br />And the weird love relationship between the priest and the &quot;atheist.&quot;  Puh-lease.  Sworn to celibacy and that easily tempted?  God save us if our Catholic priests were that lecherous and vulnerable....<br />On the DVD and film itself - I found the clip titled, &quot;Frankie and Steve Get It On&quot; unnecessary, and might I add, very pervertedly titled.  Where the makers of this film serious at all?  Arquette's character named after St. Francis of Asissi?  Pass the cheese, please.  I'm sure St. Francis is honored to have a &quot;devout atheist&quot; named after him.  Endnote:  a disgraceful and twisted portrayal of a beautiful religion, not to mention its inaccuracy of portraying an exorcism.
B000009QPE|5.0|Slayer are the undisputed kings of speed metal, and this album is widely considered their magnum opus. I have to agree. <br />Starting off with a blistering riff on track 1 (Angel of Death), this album reaches a level of intensity and agression that will leave you in awe. Tom Araya's &quot;scream-to-growl&quot; technique is on  frequent display here, which works well in matching the ferocity of the virtuoso guitar work (Henneman and King, at the top of their form). Dave Lombardo's drum work is also phenomenal, both fast in the extreme and precise enough to hear every hit. <br />The lyrical content is heavily satanic, but don't let that deter you from buying this album; you don't have to be in love with Satan to love Slayer's music. You DO have to like your music VERY fast and EXTREMELY agressive, though!
B0000203Y5|5.0|When this documentary was being filmed in 1998, the CD which was issued in 1997 had just been released and went on to win a Grammy.  It had been the result of American guitarist Roy Cooder's determination to  bring the musical sounds of Cuban music to the public.  He then brought on the German movie director, Wim Wenders, to capture on film the music, the people and Cuba itself.<br />The musicians are elderly, their musical skills developed from childhood and they are living memorials to the music they love.  Once renowned in Cuba in the 40's and 50's, these men have lived through upheaval and changes in their country, and yet approach life with joy and freshness.  The camera picks up the wrinkles, but it also picks up the twinkle in the eye of 91 year old guitarist/singer Compay Segundo who playfully talks about fathering another child to add to his family, or lead singer 70 year-old Ibraham Ferrer's affection for this wife, the 80-year old pianist Ruben Gonzolez who finds it hard to walk, but has no trouble making his fingers fly over the keyboard. Omera Portuando, the lone sultry female, adds an ageless feminine presence to the group.<br />This is not just a movie about the music.  The movie IS the music.  And there are long musical sequences which will delight anyone with a serious musical interest.  The movie is also about the individual people, whose interviews against the backdrop of a crumbling, but lively Cuba are testaments to the human spirit.  Before they were rediscovered  for this film, one of the men was shining shoes;  another was working in a cigar factory.  Politics are never mentioned, but the 1940s and 50s American cars and the disintegrating buildings is evidence of politics gone haywire four decades ago.<br />The movie culminates with a concert in Carnegie Hall and the musicians' first trip to New York.  Their sense of wonder in viewing the skyscrapers, looking at store windows and visiting the Empire State Building is a sharp contrast to the confines of their restricted world in Cuba, which is nevertheless rich with the spirits of this indomitable individuals.<br />The video does lack dramatic tension, and drags in places, but I still don't hesitate to recommend it.  It spite of poverty and a humble economy, the movie captures the beauty and joy of the people.  And it surrounds you with music.onfines of their restricted world in Cuba, which is nevertheless rich with the spirits of this indomitable individuals.<br />The video does lack dramatic tension, and drags in places, but I still don't hesitate to recommend it.

B00000K19E|5.0|How can you not love this movie?? The story behind it is something that should make everyone think, and every actor/actress was WONDERFULLY cast. The Wachowski brothers did such a nice job with the special effects, that not only was the movie something intellectual, but it was also a nice treat for action-lovers. The good guys were believable, and the bad guys were Evil. What was not to like? I personally can't wait until The Matrix 2 and 3 come out!! This has to be my favorite all-time movie!!
B000005J56|5.0|I have 2 Concert tickets for January 5, 2001 Washington DC.  I am expecting this concert will be a monumental event.  Buena Vista Social Club is a group of individuals with the power to take you back to the old smoke-filled rooms of Havana in the 1940's with the Jam Sessions going on.  Buena Vista Social Club is a producer of timeless music which will definately live on in records, CDs and tapes long after these talents are dead and gone.
B00000IPAX|2.0|After i bought Blink's chesire cat album, i've been a fan of them, but after this album, i'm not anymore.  Blink does not have that punk sound that they used to.  Buy this is you like punk-pop, but this isn't for the real punk rocker..........
B00003CXE7|3.0|Gladiator wants to be Ben-Hur, really.  There's no denying that the costumes, sets, visual effects, and gore are spectacular, but that's where the glory ends.  Russell Crowe is powerful and convincing in his role as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful as the sniveling coward Commodus, but the talents of these men are nearly overshadowed by the film's incredible length.<br />Many of the scenes involve, of course, the gladiator contests, and it is in these that we see Maximus' power as both a survivor and superior fighter.  But in all honesty, about an hour into the movie, you feel as though you've been watching it much longer.  The film moves slowly and never seems to gain any real momentum.  You can fall asleep at many points in the movie, wake up, and be completely caught up in a few minutes, as I did.  The slaughter of Maximus' family doesn't quite pull at your heart like I think the director wanted it to.  I found myself more annoyed that Maximus wouldn't assume the power that Marcus was bequeathing him.<br />That said, the extra DVD that accompanies the film is wonderful!  There are interviews, behind-the-scenes trivia, and a section of clips that ended up on the cutting room floor.  I really enjoyed watching the short segment on the costumes and special makeup required for the battle scenes.  The extra DVD has all sorts of goodies that are a DVD-owners dream!  If you're a big fan of the film and you own a DVD player, then this will be a great addition to your collection.<br />The film is certainly worth seeing at least once for all of the special effects and Russell Crowe's amazing acting skills!
B000050XEI|2.0|Along with so many others, I anxiously awaited for the newest release from Enya having enjoyed all of her previous releases. The only reason I give this release two stars is because the same outstanding production quality was evident throughout. Artistically, I'm convinced that these tracks are nothing more than out-takes from previous albums - perhaps fleshed out a bit more for the actual release. <br />What a disappointment. <br />I'm sure the Enya &quot;team&quot; has lots of really good reasons to release such an album - perhaps personal illness, contractual pressure from the record company, pay the bills, etc. <br />Please don't do it again.
B000002C25|4.0|This album could have been a 5 stars album if only they had finished every song after 5 minutes of playing. Good songs, but nothing that  justifies playing them for 7 or 8 minutes. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 3 is because Stand by me is one of the greatest songs by Oasis, a classic. I like the big guitar sound all over the place, with every channel full of guitars. But all around the world playing for 9 mintes and then a reprise for another 2 minutes can only be explained because these guys were hooked on drugs at the time. And Im glad those two left the band, they never had the correct look. They looked like taxi drivers or milkmen to me.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD does not disappoint!  Since I received my copy, I have played it endlessly to the surprise of my children who just discovered that they too like the Beatles!<br />I think this CD is a MUST for any CD collection!!
0671034065|3.0|This book is laugh-out-loud-fall-over-on-the-floor-and-roll-around funny.  If you are female, and you don't mind a bit of (...ahem) bawdy humor, you won't be able to stop laughing.  The conversations between Jaine and her friends, Sam, and the signs in the elevator, all of it is hilarious.  The characters are refreshing and very real, almost as if they were people you know (in fact, some of them might be people I know, hmmm.) <br />Unfortunately, that is pretty much all there is to recommend the book.  The mystery was predictable, every part of it, even down to who would die.  The psychotic killer was remarkably easy to recognize, and though there was a bit of a twist, I had seen it by the middle of the book.<br />The romance was hot, very hot, but that was all there was to that, too.  Though you liked both of the characters a lot, you never really got the feeling that they knew each other.  They went from flirtation to affair to marriage in about five pages, all in the middle of the book, and though they seemed to like each other well enough, there wasn't much to tell me that this would last.  <br />Anyway, read it if you want a really great, female laugh.  Pick it up with a pint of Ben and Jerry's (preferably something sinful) and sit down to read.  You will feel like this is a night out with the girls, where the jokes are dirty, and the calories don't count.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This DVD has to be one of the greatest buys out there.  It is so loaded with extras that it has a second disk for the special features.  It is loaded with trailers, 11 scenes cut from the movie, interviews with Ridley Scott and Hans Zimmer, behind the scenes features, and much much more.  The DVD is way above average when it comes to features.  It is also equipped with Dolby Digital sound that can turn any home entertainment system into your personal movie theater.<br />The movie is great!  Russell Crowe gives a stellar performance.  The movie is action packed and full of graphic fighting scenes.  It's funny to see some of the trailers on the DVD, because they try to make this movie out to be some kind of sappy love story.  This movie is about love, but the love that the trailers are refering to.  The love in this movie is Maximus' love for the old emporer and for his family.  It isn't sappy at all.  The violence in the movie is extremely graphic, but the story line is terrific and it is wonderfully done with terrific acting and a great musical score by Hans Zimmer.  If you don't have this DVD, I highly recommend you get it.  It is well worth the money.
0804106304|5.0|I have never been more deeply touched in my life than after I read this masterpiece. The pain, the deeply personal issues of 4 Chinese mothers and their daughters, the value of respect and hard work, the deeper meaning behind the tragic events in life, love, and the reasons why we do the things we do is what this book is about. Being an Asian American myself, I felt myself being described in the lives of those American daughters. I respect my heritage and ancestry, and so, I appreciate all this book has taught me about my ethnicity. Asian values are emphasized in this book, particularly in &quot;Two Kinds,&quot; where a young girl felt she was forced to be a child prodigy, to be the best piano player; but now that she's an adult, she understands why her mother wanted her to be a better, talented person. Every chapter is different, and every chapter teaches a different lesson about life. Reading this book was a spiritual experience for me, the acknowledgment of tragedies that happen everyday but that are not important enough for others to understand, for it to make the front page news. <br />The best chapter in this book is Rose Hsu Jordan: Half and Half. My favorite quote in this book is in this chapter: &quot;I think now that fate is shaped half by expectation, half by inattention.&quot; The quote on the last page sums it all up: &quot;I also see what part of me is Chinese. It is so obvious. It is my family. It is in our blood.&quot;
B00004XQ83|3.0|This is roots music to the extreme, which I'm sure works great in the movie but is just not that enjoyable for home listening. A few great tracks, especially by Alison Kraus, The Whites and Emmylou Harris. A few too many versions of &quot;A Man of Constant Sorow&quot;-what was the point of that? I'd try to listen to this before buying it, or you may be disappointed.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is one of the best albums that I own. Every song is good, even Cure for the Itch that seems to be everyones least favorite. (Ok, so it's kinda weird, but it's still cool.)  Normally I would do a break down of the traks, but for this album I would just sould repetative because THEY'RE ALL SO DAMN GOOD! Anyway, this is a must have.
B0000028RR|5.0|This album is the best rap-metal album ever!Rap and metal is a great combination which is really energetic just to listen to,and RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE take it even further with their strong pollitical messages,thrown at you via RAGE's frontman,Zack de la Rocha!This CD contains amazing music performed by great musicians!Not only do they perform amazingly but they write some funky guitar thanks to the genius Tom Morello and bassist Timmy C.(If I could use swear words to say how good this CD is,I would)No great band would be successful without a great drummer but RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE got something better.They got Brad Wilk!Please sell your little sister or anything it takes to get this album.It rocks!
B00000JCOV|1.0|If you ask me, the only song worth listening to on this entire CD is Wait and Bleed. I heard a live version of Wait and Bleed, and I decided to buy the CD. It is bad, really really bad.  I like noise like everybody else, but this just does NOT make any sense, you can barely make out any of the lyrics. The music wasn't even good.
B00000DC10|5.0|...and then some. Simply put--Refused's &quot;The Shape Of Punk To Come&quot; is the best punk album since, well...come to think of it, there isn't a punk album that even comes close. Unlike the ranting and whining of the Sex Pistols, or the sometimes brilliant and sometimes flawed punk of The Clash, Refused are both in your face and experimental without making any sacrifices. Refused know exactly what they're doing--reinventing a creatively dead genre. Let's take, for example, the first track, &quot;Worms Of The Senses/Faculties Of The Skull.&quot; The song starts off with a little intro and then the guitars kick in with full force. The first words out of screecher (notice I didn't say singer) Dennis Lyxzen's mouth are as subtle as a crowbar to the head: &quot;I got a bone to pick with capitalism and a few to break.&quot; While the song is basic guitars, bass and drums, albeit done better than any punk or hardcore band I've ever heard, it's not until the latter part of the song comes around that things get really interesting. &quot;Let's take the first bus out of here&quot; repeats Lyxzen over and over until the song explodes into absolute mayhem--mayhem, that is, that bands like MXPX, Bad Religion, Offspring, System Of A Down, and even the almighty Rage Against The Machine can't quite reach up to. Then, with no warning whatsoever, the song...stops. Some guy starts talking and, of all things, techno beats erupt everywhere. Green Day this is not. Refused singlehandedly made the punk genre new and fresh again with this one CD. How exactly? By incorporating heavy metal guitars, techno beats, a song time limit over two and a half minutes, violins, and even samples of jazz sessions--all of which are regularly a big no-no amongst punk bands. Thank god then Refused are no regular punk band. Like the punk greats before them (Fugazi, Black Flag, Nirvana, Sonic Youth, The Clash and, even to a much lesser extent, early Offspring), Refused aren't afraid of taking a chance--something that eludes all the mind-numbing punk bands of today. Naming your album &quot;The Shape Of Punk To Come&quot; is either very cocky or precise. As you'll quickly find out, Refused are the latter. Just take the first and only single off the album, &quot;New Noise.&quot; &quot;New Noise&quot; is literally new noise--completely innovative. The song builds up for the first minute or so, then, just as you think the song is gonna explode, it doesn't. Those techno beats come back into play then our political hero Dennis screeches three magic words: &quot;Can I scream?&quot; And, as he answers himself, &quot;Yeah!&quot; More techno beats come in, as well as more samples, breaks and explosions. This song alone just proves my point that that Refused are still owed a revolution; it's utterly brilliant, and yet, it's just one song. &quot;Protest Song '68&quot; is smarter than Blink-182 or Green Day will ever hope to be. The guitars especially are noteworthy, the way they bleed, then go into a lush melody, and then scream bloody murder are pure genius. It's the darkest song on the album, and yet, it has one of the most beautiful melodies ever written smack dab in the middle of all the ugliness. How daring is that? Perhaps the lyrical highpoint on the album is &quot;The Deadly Rhythm.&quot; Just take a look at what Dennis says: &quot;Is it our duty to die for governments and for gods? Is it our privelage to slave for market and industry? Is it our right to follow laws set to scare and to oppress? Is it our gift to stay in line and will it take away the blame? We can no longer pay the price. We'll get organized. We will no longer believe that working for you will set us free.&quot; And yes, it's just as good musically, too. &quot;Liberation Frequency&quot; isn't unlike something Nirvana would do--whisper to scream vocals, soft to brutal guitars--just replace the angst with lyrics that attack radio. The beautiful vocals in the beginning make you think you're listening to a female singer, as they're very soft and feminine. But no, that's just Dennis waiting to scream his head off--and he does so during the chorus lines of &quot;What frequency are you getting? Is it noise or sweet sweet music? On what frequency will liberation be?&quot; Like, dude, um, I don't think Refused will be getting airplay on KROQ anytime soon. &quot;The Shape Of Punk To Come&quot; ends with--what else?--an acoustic song. The final lines of it are so truthful it's almost haunting: &quot;Sabotage will set us free. Throw a rock in the machine.&quot; Sadly, on the eve of the album's release, Refused--again, what else?--broke up (hint, hint: I bet the song &quot;Refused Are _______ Dead&quot; was more than just a title). Supposedly, Dennis and the rest of the band couldn't see eye to eye on doing both political lyrics and creating brilliant music. Funny, I thought they did a pretty good job myself. While bands like NOFX and Blink-182 are &quot;good in their own way&quot; *grin,* Refused are where it's really at. In all seriousness, it breaks my heart to know that people were listening to KoRn, Jay-Z, and Marilyn Manson back when this came out over Refused. I think Refused themselves knew they might have made an album just a little too challenging and smart for some, but as the lines of &quot;Summer Holidays vs. Punk Routine&quot; go: &quot;Rather be forgotten than remembered for giving in.&quot; That may be what Dennis says, but I'll never forget Refused. Never. &quot;We could be dangerous--art as a real threat.&quot; This is the best punk album ever.
B000051VWW|5.0|As usual, I'm enjoying Sade's new release, Lover's Rock.  True to form, Sade integrates her sultry voice with meaningful lyrics and soothing music to make a great album.  I advise all Sade fans to listen to this release while sitting in front of a fireplace with incense burning, book in hand and relax.
0792153189|5.0|This is a great SF movie by a women director who focuses on the emotional aspects rather than the hero dynamics. <br />An enormous rock is heading straight for the Earth. Morgan Freeman, America's first black President (after a recount), decides to build a giant spaceship called the 'ARK' to preserve the American way of life. After it is constructed, the entire population of the United States climb on board and take off, leaving the rest of the World to their fate. But unluckily the ARK is destroyed when it crashes into the comet above the Earth's atmosphere, smashing the comet into thousands of tiny pieces.<br />The movie ends on a hopeful note as the human race bravely braces itself to face a future without any Americans.
B000051VWW|4.0|Lover's Rock is vintage Sade.  The sultry voice, smooth music and meaningful lyrics all combine to make this a powerful piece.  I encourage all Sade fans to listen to this CD in front of the fireplace with incense burning and book in hand.
B00004Z459|1.0|Poserness... poserness... and more poserness. One of a deluge of unoriginal hacks (limp bizkit, korn, staind, papa roach, cold, disturbed, mudyvane, slipknot... you get the picture) to come out since &quot;heavy&quot; music has been made popular again by the mainstream music media. While this album is a bunch of other things, I will confine my tirade to the utter musical ineptitude of the cd. Ah, let us start with the guitars. Hmm, seems no one has bothered to learn how to read at least treble clef and relies and tabs and power chords. Power chords, power chords, and more power chords with maybe one cheap hook thrown in (as in one step closer) to totally prevent the listener from falling asleep. Riff changes and polyrhthmics=none to be found. As for solos, this band has probably had no formal guitar training in your life so don't bet on any whiplash shreds and broken arpeggios like Morbid Angel's Trey Azagthoth. Consequently, Linkin Park rely on the now typical half stepped down tuned guitaring first pioneered by death metal bands like Suffocation on either what is an ESP or Ibanez set with some kind of DiMarzio blaze pickups. Of course, a lot of feedback is added to hide the many errors present in the cd if you compare it with the sheet music. Now onto the bass... like many other numetal bands, the bass is completely distorted or undermined by the overproduced guitar sound to hide the fact the bass player is only twanging away at one pattern over and over and over (not even playing it right at that). The vocals and lyrics are utterly inane. It it the typical &quot;teenage angst&quot; ridden &quot;why is the world so bad to me&quot; boo hoo hoo. Two vocalists is not a new idea in the slightest and one is subordinate and only yells a few stupid phrases in each song. C'mon, a DJ!? Like this would have ever happened before Slipknot came along. The drumming is totally unforgettable and untalented. All you hear are the crash symbols and the snares in the same trite 4/4 pattern... of which the drummer cannot even keep. If you're lookin for insane inverted blastbeat acrobatics and polyrhthmics, like Cryptopsy's Flo Mounier, you will be sorely disappointed. Bottom word, this band is tantamount to a bunch of 14 year old tonedeaf teenager's covering Korn songs in their parent's garrage that got a lucky break.
B00001ZWTS|3.0|In my youth the TV series &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; was one of my favorites.  Many times I rushed home from school to see the latest episode... So I eagerly awaited the release of the new movie onto video. (Yes, I waited a while to write my review.)<br />I must admit, I was a bit disappointed... but mostly because I know how good the original series was.<br />In the movie Will Smith is a questionable choice for the role of James West.  In the TV series, James West was a man with a cocky attitude and a reputation with the ladies, but Will Smith goes slightly overboard.  Smith does have a tendancy to bring his own brand of low humor to his movies (although &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; showed his real talent as an actor), and it almost seems as if Smith is starring in the movie as HIMSELF, not James West.<br />Kevin Kline, on the other hand, performed a wonderfully accurate rendition of the Artemus Gordon character of the TV show.  And all the costumes and gadgets that Artemus was known for in the series are here in the movie as well... including the tricked-out James Bond-style steam locomotive!<br />The villan's plot is even wilder than ever, thanks to modern Hollywood special effects.  Although a 80 foot tall mechanical spider might be hard to believe, the TV series was equally unbelievable at times.<br />The begining of the movie was a bit hard to follow... but the story becomes clearer as the film progresses, and introduces some drama at points, while keeping a sense of humor.<br />In short, it is a disappointment compared to the long-late &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; TV show... but not bad as a movie.  Even though it doesn't live up to the expectation of it's inspiration, it won't disappoint those who haven't grown up with the TV version.<br />The end of the movie seems to suggest there might be a sequel in the works... I nervously await its comming.  Hopefully the few wrinkles in the first movie will be straightened out by then
B000051VWW|5.0|I loved this album instantly even though it was different from her previous CDs. It's more stripped down and acoustic, and the production is less polished. What we get is the immediacy and intimacy of a live performance, and this is unusual for a Sade album. For those listeners who've complained about the demo-like quality of the album, Sade has suggested in interviews that it was deliberately done to capture an intimate vibe. In USA Today, she said that more polished cuts of some tracks (like Flow) were discarded for slightly less perfect cuts because they contained a vibe that the band couldn't replicate. The approach works. Early albums like Diamond Life were slick, polished, and generally excellent, but there was an emotional distance to them that seemed calculated to construct the &quot;Sade mystique&quot; (listen to Your Love Is King and No Ordinary Love, which are almost disconcerting in their iciness and detachment). On Lovers Rock, there is a richness, subtlety, and emotional range to Sade's singing that wasn't apparent before. The simplicity of the arrangements only serves to accentuate the raw beauty of her voice. Listen to the emotionalism of King of Sorrow, or her restrained and delicate phrasing on the title cut; but especially listen to her stark singing on the knockout last song, Only Love Gets You Through, accompanied only by a mournful organ, and you'll feel, despite the lack of production finesse, her soulful vibe like before. I've been a fan since Diamond Life but I never really thought of Sade as a true soul singer (her style was more suggestive of soulfulness than actually being soulful). But with this album I've changed my mind. Lovers Rock amply demonstrates that she is one of the most remarkable soul singers around.
0792151712|5.0|How could anyone take one of the greatest tragedies the world has ever known, superimpose a fictional love story over it, and turn it into a movie?  VERY WELL, that's how.<br />The ship portrayed in the film is incredibly realistic... the viewer can really believe these sets were the ones that have been resting at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean for so long.  It was quite a feat for the Hollywood set designers to create something that so convincingly portrays the interior compartments of the most luxurious ocean liner in history.<br />Many would complain that a fictional romance was featured so strongly in a movie based on actual historical events.  I have no such complaints.<br />The purpose of the love story between Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio) was to give the viewer a human perspective... To make the viewer FEEL how tragic the Titanic disaster really was.  Director James Cameron was wildly successful in this area.  I saw it in a theater (the first time) and many people around me seemed to be crying... I suppose everyone knew the ship was going to sink before we entered the theater, but weren't prepared to see the human aspect of the tragedy... the fictional love story.  Wonderful writing!<br />Here is a story for everyone.  It is fairly accurate, historically, so it appeals to the history buffs.  It's also a romantic love story, and a tear jerker.  A tragedy.. and it even has its share of action scenes.   And, all of it is done respectfully to those very real people who lost their lives on board the R.M.S. Titanic.  It is a wonderful tribute.
B00003CXE6|5.0|At first when i saw this movie would be out, i got excited, and expected a whole lot from it, which tottaly destroys a movie, right? wrong. not this one. i expected a lot, and it surpassed my expectations! i was (and still am) into mideval times when i saw the film, and it just brought the fantisies of leading an army into war into life. It incorperated many fantasy aspects as well, and the part i like most about this movie is the ending isn't what you would expect. the special effects are great, the storyline flows well, acting is supurb, everything is just magnificent! if you havn't seen it, go see it now! you must see this epic film.
6303255191|5.0|This is probably one of the most influentual movies I've ever seen. I still watch it at least twice a year. I live in the urban suburbs of Cape Town, South Africa WHERE GANG VIOLENCE is as normal as eating breakfast. When this movie came out certain organizations took to the values depicted in the movie like Familia , La Raza,respect ,discipline, honour,pride and dignity. These particular organizations, once notorious for their violence, utilized these values to upgrade their lifestyles to help upgrade the lifestyles of others. It created the closeness of brotherly love depicted in the movie and also what can be achieved if everyone is commited to sticking together. Viva los Vatos Locos.
0805047905|5.0|I tried to interest my daughter in books early on (around 5 or 6 months) but she showed very little interest for a long time.  She'd bat the book away, look elsewhere, or try to destroy the pages.  I read in &quot;The Read Aloud Handbook&quot; that babies like simple pictures, so I picked up &quot;Brown Bear&quot; in the bookstore one day.  For the first time, my daughter actually looked at the pages while I read a book.  She's now almost 15 months, and she will choose this book over any other--she names the animals for me, and flips the pages back and forth, &quot;reading&quot; the book to herself.  It's not the most interesting children's book I've ever read, certainly, but the rhyming and the pictures caught her attention, and got her interested in books.  For that, this book is invaluable to me, and I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00004THAY|2.0|Here you have two Greats playing together. I think you might find a few songs you like, but like Mom always said, &quot;If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.&quot;. Keeping that in mind, I have nothing more to say and I love the blues and these two artists. Maybe my expectations were just too high.
1573226521|5.0|A true masterpiece.  Do *not* watch the movie before reading this book, since the movie does no justice whatsoever.  This book I would highly recommend to backpackers / people who like to travel.  It is the story of a backpacker's quest for adventure in the most remote places of the world, and how he stumbles upon a secret beach which becomes a modern day version of Lord of the Flies.  Written with excellent detail, great action, and an obviously intelligent and well traveled author- you won't be able to put it down after the first chapter.
B00004T9UF|5.0|ok, for all you people who take everything serious and get offended by the littlest thing...this is not for you, try maybe....backstreet boys. but for the rest of you, you need this cd. eminem's raps are a little twisted but that's what makes it so good. all music doesn't reflect the good points of society, and  in this case, he even makes it funny. overall this cd has a great beat and catchy hooks. this cd is great and yes he talks about killing people, drugs, sex...(ya know the same things we hear everyday on the news) so what is the big deal about it being in music anyway? if you don't get offended, have a sense of humor and like good music this cd is for you. if you are one of those &quot;other&quot; people why are you even looking on this page? you have heard enough about eminem to know what he's all about.
0553106635|5.0|IMHO A Song of Ice and Fire is one of the best if not THE best Fantasy series ever written.. so far. If you have read the 1st two volumes you know what to expect - solid writing, sharp dialogue, surprising yet logical plot twists and most importantly (especially in the world of today's fantasy) very believable characters. If you have not yet read the first two volumes, than go read them. Now.
B0000064TT|5.0|I'm ordering the CD today for a friend and myself. <br />I pulled out old albums tonight.  The studio quality on the album is better then a lot of CDs today.  Plus this band is INCREDIBLE!<br />I saw them live once.  The are even better in the flesh.  The layers . . unfortunately, a lot of people can't even hear what they are doing.  It just sounds like a roar.<br />It's funny.  The bands I remember always had a good engineer in the studio.
014028009X|4.0|Bridget Jones is a real woman, thank God!  She is not the perfect woman, and she is not struggling with her perfect life, she is struggling in the real world, just like everbody else.  Bridget Jones is  a character to identify with and love for all her faults. <br />Helen Fielding has created a book, that does not worry about: 'the message it sends out', but understands a book of fiction is about entertainment, and with Fieldings pithy, witty way of writing it is guaranteed to entertain.<br />A book for all interested in real life, and real women.
0790742314|4.0|I was just a young teenie when »Gremlins« came out and turned into a huge success. I enjoyed it very much back then, and today, I still enjoy watching this Classic once in a while. It has just everything that a film should have. Excitement, thrills, love, friendship, evil versus good, and not least: humour! Furthermore, »Gremlins« is very well made.<br />Don't miss this film! It's one of those that you simply have to have seen. A true classic!!
B0000039LE|3.0|This is probably the prototype slasher movie. It's slow moving, but somewhat atmospheric. It's a movie one should have seen, but it's not quite as good as it's reputation.
068484267X|5.0|This is an amazing book as is his second book ('Tis) which follows this one.  Frank Mc Court is a powerful writer.  I cried, I laughed, I smiled.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Like I said I just flew back from reykjavik to boston.  I saw the film in Bjork's native land with Icelandic subtitles and all, it truly added to the experience.       As far as the soundtrack goes, I appreciate Bjork's endeavor in keeping it the way she wanted as much as possible however, as I was sitting in the theater I kept making a stir and whispering to a friend I had  met there... my main contention:  Why was the soundtrack different than the movie?  I had purchased the CD a month prior to viewing the film but couldn't find it playing in Georgia(big surprise!) and was used to the lyrics, but during the film I kept hoping it would follow the soundtrack more.  Yet to no avail.  Notable difference I wish would come out in a true to movie version: 1.  Jeff's voice would have been heard and the train workers in I'VE SEEN IT ALL 2. In the movie Selma's boy sings &quot;you just did what you had to do&quot;  but in the soundtrack you hear &quot;you're going to have to find out for yourself&quot; the former makes more sense after seeing the movie and is truly one of the most haunting things I have ever seen in a film  3. Joel Gray's voice was omitted from IN THE MUSICALS, why? and lastly 4. THE NEXT TO LAST SONG was ommited, this should definetly be in the soundtrack.     Anyway much praise for Bjork, Lars and Catherine.  American filmakers should take heed and be a little more realistic with our movies and not always give them happy endings, it makes for a sad yet impressive impact on you.  Dancer in the dark is no different...  Furthermore,  I think Bjork has raw talent and was very convincing.  I do feel bad for her best friend who I recently heard in the icelandic version of the musical HAIR (GREAT STUFF!!)  called &quot;Harith&quot; who is also very talented.  Her friend has been acting and working at it her whole life and Bjork being the talent that she is, does her first major picture (aside from THE JUNIPER TREE of course)and wins all these awards yet doesn'teven really care about acting.  WOW!! That is raw talent.   And finally on a side note fans of Bjork should also check out the Icelandic band Sigur-ros, they are truly innovative and years ahead of their time.
B00003CXDG|1.0|I watched it, and were so angry after it was finished... No spirit - lousy acting - unnatural stunts etc etc etc Well - I sold it forward as quick as possible (when it still was worth something) I bet that after a month it  is on sale for 5$ (and even that is too much for it) I think Jonh Woo was mentioned as a director just for increasing sales. This is a guess, but I think  Tom was influencing a lot in background. (MI1 was actually a very good movie and Tom did well in it.)
B00000064G|5.0|Being mesmerized by a VW Cabriolet commercial prompted me to search for the talented artist whose beautiful song and voice kept my eyes and ears glued to the TV screen.  Then one night a special on Nick Drake caught my eye.  They were playing the song from the commercial, which I learned was titled &quot;Pink Moon,&quot; and after hearing some more samples from the CD, I set out to find it.  &quot;Pink Moon&quot; is absolutely amazing, chilling, and spellbinding.  It is the perfect relaxation music, if not simply perfect music in general.  Nick Drake's sad story increases the emotions you will feel as you listen to his voice.  He died before he reached muscial stardom, but his talents are timeless.  He is music's best kept secret and any music fan's best discovery, so go and buy any of Nick Drake's four albums.  You will not  be sorry.
B000023VR6|2.0|GREAT BEATS no one can do it better, but dre needs better things to talk about,i mean he talks about how great he is,he talks about himself,chronic and ho's. he has a few songs where he has good things to say but not much. so only problem is the lyrics.
0060254920|5.0|When I was a child, I borought this book every time I was at the library, I adored it, and when my little son was born, it was he first book I bought him. His 6 years now, and loves it too.  The story is simple but truly magical, a childs imagination where everything is possible and totally normal. It's not strange that you can go where the wild things are and be wild among them for a day and a year and come back 10 minutes later where your food is still warm, and your mum isn't mad at you any more because she loves you even if you are wild. It's really a absolutely wonderful book, and I'm tuched by it every time I read, and reread it, - over and over again.
B00004Z511|5.0|Simply purchase this album. Every music fan should have this. Really original production combined with sweeping songs make &quot;Kid A&quot; my favorite LP this year. <br />Don't be swayed by bad reviews that say its too &quot;experimental&quot; - its not - its very listenable. On the other hand don't be swayed by good reviews that say its flawless - its not - they can do better. And hopefully Radiohead will in April with the release of Amnesiac, their fifth album.<br />Overall, &quot;Kid A&quot; is a wonderful album that I'll enjoy for years to come.
B000056N8X|4.0|It's the merging of the television series and the movie series into one action packed flick. Adrian Paul plays the TV the immortal Highlander Duncan MacLeod, born in 1592 in the highlands of Scotland. His clansman and mentor, Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) of the movie series is facing his greatest challenge. An evil immortal name Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne, who played such memorable villans in Passerger 57 and recently in Dungeons and Dragons) is bent on revenge against Connor for past transgressions and his form of revenge is to kill everything Connor holds dear. Duncan comes into help his clansmen, but discovers that with Kell is someone that brings Duncan back to the worst point of his past. Spectacular fight scenes between Adrian Paul and Kung-Fu master Donnie Yen, as well as the thrilling climatic final scenes make this a worthy sequel to the original Highlander movie. It will also satisfy the hardcore tv series faithful. In addition, the DVD promises to deliver bonus footage that was cut from the eventual theatrical release. <br />Good flick!
B00004Z459|5.0|Wow! I was very surprised at how good this cd turned out to be. I had listened to the single  many times and thought it was pretty good so i picked up this cd. I found out that I enjoyed alot of the tracks more than the single one step closer. My personal favorites include &quot;With You&quot;, &quot;Points of Authority&quot;, &quot;In the end&quot;, and &quot;forgotten&quot;.&quot;with you&quot; is probably my favorite with &quot; points of authority coming in at a close second. This cd is definetly worth picking up as all of the songs are extremely solid. Oh and one more thing Linkin Park wipes the floor with Limp Bizkit!
6304056958|5.0|I remember hearing four or five years back that a remake of the 1939 classic, &quot;The Women,&quot; was in the offing.  I don't know whatever happened to the plans for that remake, but it's hard to imagine that such a film could be made today.  It reinforces just about every negative and politically incorrect stereotype about women imaginable, up to and including Norma Shearer's final line about pride being a luxury that a woman in love can't afford.  It also includes other statements that couldn't be made today (&quot;She thinks that because Lulu's dark he won't be able to see her&quot; and &quot;It's not her fault she wasn't born deaf and dumb&quot;).<br />The film, according to its trailer, has a cast of 135 women.  I presume that they are talking about the speaking roles because there are certainly more women on screen than that.  There is not a single man to be seen anywhere; even the various animals are female.  There is one scene near the beginning where a photo of a man graces the back of a magazine cover; this shot stands out like a sore thumb each time I see it, and I wish somebody had caught it and corrected it.<br />Despite its political incorrectness, &quot;The Women&quot; is one of the funniest and most rib-tickling films ever made.  I've probably watched it more than any other film in my collection; I've even  taped the soundtrack and listened to it, a thoroughly satisfying way to enjoy &quot;The Women&quot; in the car, for example.<br />Of course the raison d'etre of this spectacular film is the bitchiness of almost all the leading characters, set off by Norma Shearer's near-saintly Mary Haines.  Such a character would be considered a crashing bore nowadays--her scene with daughter Mary, played by Virginia Weidler, gets this very fast-paced comedy off to an incredibly leaden start--and I have a hard time believing that she ever carried the full sympathy of the audience.  Even her wise old mother, delightfully played by Lucile Watson, displays more character; fumigating the room after a party attended by most of the of the other characters, she says &quot;How do you stand those dreadful women?&quot;<br />Rosalind Russell as Sylvia Fowler gets the cattiest lines and somehow manages to be able to talk a mile a minute through the whole film, even while doing strenuous physical exercises.  Her two scenes with Joan Crawford are the high points of the film.  Joan had to fight for the relatively short but very important role of Crystal Allen, the &quot;terrible man-trap&quot; who steals Stephen Haines, Norma Shearer's husband, but her hunch paid off:  despite the brevity of her role, Crystal dominates the film from the time of her first appearance.  And even though she gets her comeuppance at the end (an element missing from the original play by the way), she leaves in triumph, looking gorgeous and with one of the best exit lines ever written.<br />The supporting cast doesn't have a weak link.  One standout is Paulette Goddard, the most beautiful woman in the cast and certainly one of the most spirited, as Miriam Aarons, a junior-league Crystal Allen.  Another is Mary Boland as the ditzy but generous-hearted Comtesse de Lave; even after her fifth husband Buck Winston has left her for Crystal, she still refers to the radio moguls who wouldn't give Buck a job on the radio as &quot;the old meanies.&quot;  But all the leads are spectacular:  Joan Fontaine as the naive Peggy, Marjorie Main as Lucy, the proprietess of the Reno dude ranch, Phyllis Povah as Edith (largely forgotten nowadays, she was brought over from Broadway to recreate her role for the film), Florence Nash as tweed-suited Nancy the author, and the others.<br />One thing I have come to appreciate more with each viewing of this film is how many actresses, many of whose names I don't even know, created truly memorable characters with just a handful of lines or less.  My own particular favorite is Virginia Grey, another very beautiful woman, as Crystal's pal/nemesis Pat in the delightful telephone scene (and anybody who thinks Crawford can't act should see this scene).  But others such as Olga the manicurist, Butterfly McQueen as Lulu, and the wonderful model whose tag line is &quot;Our new one-piece lace foundation garment; zips up the back and no bones,&quot; are just three more standouts in a hugely talented supporting cast.  They prove the old adage that &quot;there are no small parts, just small actors.&quot;<br />&quot;The Women&quot; is one of those films that makes me feel especially sorry for people who claim they can't watch black-and-white films.  I'm not referring to the technicolor fashion show sequence when I say that this is certainly one of the most colorful films ever made.
0425074811|5.0|Like they said, the past is different from what we call 'history', since history is reconstructed by man through his research, logic, reasonings, and alnaysis. Therefore anyone who says von Daniken &amp; other authors like his are full of crap are really sold by the norm who thinks that whatever is commonly accepted is the 'truth'. <br />As we move into the new millennium, we human beings desperately need a paradign shift in their thinking. Evidences like those provided by Daniken should be taken seriously, studied and open a new possiblity to our interpretation of the past. Yes, HISTORY IS AN INTERPRETATION OF THE PAST, and we should be more open minded to the evidences presented. <br />Archeologiests and anthropologist take the facts and reconstuct the past from it. They should NOT discard proofs of ancient technology which is more advanced than we think, and turn a blind eye on it. For example, historians have no place for things found from the past (eg. an ancient device later proven to be a simple battery, and the convex lens from ancient times, and a machine like cog that was found under the sea which were dated to ancient times) in their &quot;history of man&quot;, all because they presume that ancient people live in the cave and simply can't produce these things. They can't fit it into their 'dumb cavemen' history so they discard these artifacts. And these artifacts are displayed in museums! What a contradiction!<br /><br />As we move on in time, new discoveries are reported each day, and over the years, we see the date of the 'oldest skeleton found' keep changing and back-dating, as they discover more &amp; more. They used to say it is impossible to have life on Mars since there's no water...well now they just found there is actually water underground, AND an Australian research just reported that a meteorite from Mars found 35 years ago contain fossils of micro lifeforms, ie, alien lifeforms.<br /><br />We need to keep an open mind on these evidences thatare presented to us, and open up the possibilities. I am not saying Daniken is 100% correct, because even he does not want to draw a conclusion (unlike the academis historians who think they are always right), but all he wants is to ask possible questions that face us as we are faced with the artifacts. History does not belong to the historians, so dont let them tell you that if they say ancient men are dumb cavemen, then it is the truth. Open up.
6304698658|5.0|With the Christmas season approaching, I thought I'd give my review of Christmas Vacation. While some people are watching It's a Wonderful Life, I'm watching the hilarious antics of Clark W. Griswold. <br />If you've seen the other Vacation movies, you know that poor old Clark W. Griswold brings disaster with him wherever he goes. Although, with this go-round, he stays home this time, trying to throw a &quot;Good-old-fashioned-family Christmas&quot;. But, of course, there's disaster at every corner. Clark staples himself to a storm gutter putting up Christmas lights, which cause brownouts. A squirrel lives in his Christmas tree. His cousin's doberman brings down the house. Literally. His snooty neighbors won't cut him any slack. He puts an experimental kitchen lubricant on his pan sled.  And, on top of that, his hilariously goofy cousin (Randy Quaid) shows up without warning. <br />The cast is great. Chevy Chase is, as always, histerical, as is Beverly D'Angelo as his smart-aleck wife. Julia-Louis Dreyfus is great as one of Clark's stuck-up neighbors, but the funniest role has to be Randy Quaid as Clark's redneck cousin, Eddie. Quaid was perfect for that role, as well as the rest of Clark's and Ellen's families. I also like the animated Santa intro to the movie, where Santa visits the Griswold residence. If you think you're having a bad holiday, one viewing of this film will quickly change your mind. If you don't laugh at this movie, I will come over to your house and force you to watch this movie several times over. You have to see Christmas Vacation at least once. How could you not laugh at Clark's antics?
B000002J1F|5.0|&quot;Fragile&quot; is the album that put Yes on the commercial map with the outstanding tracks &quot;Roundabout&quot; and &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot;, although it would not be another twelve years before they would return to the U.S. Top 40 with &quot;Owner Of A Lonely Heart&quot; including some personnel changes. It is on &quot;Fragile&quot; where we are exposed to the classic Yes lineup and sound featured on the above two tracks, as well as in meticulously composed arrangements like &quot;Cans And Brahms&quot;, which shows off the band's penchant for classical music, as well as in Chris Squire's offbeat, syncopated bass rhythms heard in the brief &quot;Five Per Cent For Nothing&quot;. Repetetiveness is the operative key heard in the line &quot;Tell The Moon Or Tell The Marcher&quot;, which is the main line along with the sometime repeated title in &quot;We Have Heaven&quot;. The tone is then set for the chilly, then progressively rocking vibes in &quot;South Side Of The Sky&quot;. Yes' progressive-rock roots begin to take shape in &quot;The Fish&quot;. while &quot;Mood For A Day&quot; and the first half of &quot;Heart Of The Sunrise&quot; slow down the pace of the CD in general, but is finally relieved by the rollicking finish in the latter half of &quot;Sunrise&quot;. New member Rick Wakeman's musicianship and style of play put &quot;Fragile&quot; in the proper musical perspective. This is one CD to add to your collection!
0316777722|5.0|Being an avid reader of many genres of literature, Me Talk Pretty  One Day has to be the most humourous novel I have ever read.  David Sedaris takes his personal experiences and compiles them into a halarious novel that I just couldn't put down.  David tells about his experiences in France and of his family, where my favorite essay comes into mind.  He tells about his lovely brother in the story titled You Can't Kill the Rooster.  I have also read Naked and Holidays On Ice by David Sedaris and I have been to a reading where I had the chance to hear David tell these stories himself. When my mother recommened David Sedaris to me, I didn't know what to expect.  She said that he was funny, but I wasn't sure how funny.  Me Talk Pretty One Day is highly reccommed for those who need a good laugh and want the pleasure of knee-slapping humor and somewhat appalling stories that you could never believe to be true.  If you want to do yourself a favor by adding some laughter into your life, pick up a copy of Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris.
B00003OST8|5.0|Errol Flynn dosen't actually use a buckler, but you get the idea. This is 'the' Robin Hood movie; don't waste your time on Robin Hoods with Midwestern accents.       The political implications of Robin Hood are usually thought to favor the Left.  This movie shows Robin in his true color - as a counterrevolutionary, fighting for restoration of the legitimate government, for the rights of yeomen farmers not to be taxed to death, and against usurpation and tyranny.  Thomas Jefferson could have written much of this script.  The un-PC Robin uses weapons to poach deer, confronts the local government over their abuse of power, and his democratic manners come out in sharp contrast to the rigid formality of the Court Party.         Errol Flynn fits the part to a 'T,' and the viewer can well imagine him, had he been born seven centuries earlier, actually being the title character.  Olivia de Haviland positively glows, and portrays the spirited courage and character that her faith and breeding were supposed to instill in every scene.  Not as often mentioned is Richard the Lionheart, who, although absent until the final scenes, is so much larger than life that he dominates the screen when he appears.        The duel scene, the use of shadows, and the many-splendored pagentry have been celebrated often enough to make any further praise redundant.  Taken as a whole, this is the best movie of its' kind, and the standard against which this writer has measured all others since it became his childhood favorite. -Lloyd Conway
B00000AFWW|5.0|Okay I think personally that this is an incredible album! It is so well polished and documents everything the band went through for the four years before it was released. Its a masterpiece. It kicks off with their first released single &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, a really fun way to start it off... great party song with great lyrics. Then there is &quot;Awful&quot; which in some ways could be a follow up to their hit &quot;Miss World&quot; as to the content. Then there is &quot;Hit So Hard&quot; a beautiful beautiful wonderful song. Then &quot;Malibu&quot; which I personally think is one of the most beautiful songs ever. It has such lovely lyrics and harmonies. Then &quot;Reasons to Be Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Dying&quot; a very sad, sweet song, &quot;Use Once and Destroy&quot;, &quot;Northern Star&quot; an amazing song, its so full of emotion and Eric plays the guitar so well... though it is a little Pumpkin's-esque. Then the album lightens up to &quot;Boys on The Radio&quot; one of my very favourite Hole albums, its such a great pop song, with beautiful beautiful lyrics, then &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot;, &quot;Playing Your Song&quot; and the beautiful song &quot;Petals&quot; ending the CD on a wonderful note, though slightly depressed.  This CD shows how much Courtney and the rest of the band have changed. Slightly more poppy, but with such beautiful lyrics and Mellisa's melodies are incredible. I recommend this CD to anyone!
B00000J2KX|1.0|I never saw why this movie was so popular, it meanders through a rather dull-interiored house, has an onslaught of poorly constructed (and poorly executed) dialogue, and just loves that annoying little boy.  I don't know if I'm the only one that's noticed the nearly complete overhaul Kubrick did in writing it, but I can't be the only one that saw how much better the dang ABC version of it was.  I could barely last through the slow and monotonous 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I surely hate lasting through this.  Kubrick needed to let someone else write, direct, and produce his movies.
B00003CX9W|3.0|Advertised as &quot;Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.0..&quot;, the sound here is in stereo only.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I have just recently purchased and watched the DVD of &quot;Scary Movie,&quot; a Wayans bros. movie. I knew that when i bought the movie it was going to be very sick and I was right. All the reviews that were made about this movie saying that it should have requested an x-rating are probabally right. THIS IS NOT A KID'S MOVIE! Although aimed at kids audience, kids are hardly the right audience that should be able to watch this.     If you was like me and thought the cartoon pic of a male's private anatomy was sick on South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut then you haven't seen nuthin' yet! Scary Movie shows the real deal stuff and I'm not saying once but like four times! A guy gets impaled by a man's you-know-what. Now is that a sick gag or what?     But I laughed, and that is all that matters. This movie is porbabally the most clever spoof of movies ever. If you are a fan of the cartoon series South Park then you will truley like this movie because it playes just like a live action version of a South Park episode.<br />    Now comes my review of the DVD. This DVD is woth the money bey all means, altough it's not the greatest DVD ever. I purchased this DVD for 19.95-you can't beat that for a new release DVD! It contains a good behind the scense making of Scary Movie, the notorious theatrical trailor that lured so many kids into this movie, and several explicit scenes that were cut from the movie. They are real funny and should not be missed. This DVD also has trailors for other movies like Dont be A menace in South Central ( while drinking your juice in the hood), Gone In Sixty Seconds, the Scary Movie Soundtrack, ect.     A great buy. A DVD that had me entertained for while. Thank you for your time.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminen has his only unique musicaly direction that no one will ever be able to get close to.  The Marshell Mathers album is excellent from start to finish and i couldn't fault one track.  Featuring the Uk number ones Real Slim Shady, and Stan and the Uk top ten What I Am (My favourite)  it shows that lyriclly Eminen is far superior to all those around him at the moment.
B00004U8PA|5.0|I FIRST WENT TO SEE THIS IN A THEATRE WHERE THEY HAD THE PEOPLE ACTING IT ON A STAGE.  THIS IS A TRUE CLASSIC.  WE WENT EVERY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT TO SEE THIS.  MY STEP-BROTHER AND OLDER SISTER ARE TRUE &quot;ROCKY HORROR FANS.&quot;  I WATCH IT IN MY LIVING ROOM AND STILL GET UP TO DO THE TIME-WARP.  MY HUSBAND THINKS I'M A NUT.  RECOMMED IT TO ALL TRUE ROCKY HORROR FANS.  LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN....
0440234743|1.0|frankly, i have not been able to finish this book. i stopped somewhere in the middle where the drunk lawyer was out in the wild looking for the heiress. odly enough, the book begins with a fast and exciting pace. then it drags on for the next 200+ pages and counting. the only reason i give this book a star is because my man grisham has to be worth at least a lil something. but seriously, grish, you have to snap out of your slumber. your last 2 books: testament and brethren (another bore to read) have been very, very, weak. at 25bucks a pop (paperback), you gotta give a bros his money's worth.
0790742322|5.0|I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS SO FUNNY, MICHAEL KEATON AS BEETLEJUICE WAS RIGHT ON.  AND ALEC BALDWIN PLAYING A GEEKY HUSBAND IS PRICELESS.  I LOVE THE DA-OO SCENCE.  THE KIDS AND I REALLY ENJOY THIS ONE.
B000002ADT|5.0|Every time I listen to this CD I appreciate it more.  It's an amazing work for even a fledgling jazz fan (such as myself).  The style is approachable and exciting at the same time.  If you don't own this CD at one point in your life, you're making a terrible mistake.
6304509154|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC.  I STILL CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE CLOSET DOOR IS CLOSED TIGHT AND THAT THERE ARE NO STUFFED ANIMALS IN MY ROOM.  I DON'T EVEN OWN A CLOWN.  THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE.  SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE VERY WELL DOWN.  ESPECIALLY THE TREE COMING TO LIFE.
0195117298|2.0|What I liked most about this book were the author's revelations about the great men of science and how events in their lives had influenced their ways of thinking and their discoveries.  <br />The author clearly recognizes that every scientific &quot;law&quot; or &quot;theory&quot; is a model, usually a mathematical construction, and not reality itself.  The founding concept is generally a bright (hopefully) idea which the originator attempts to cloak in the most appropriate math at his disposal.  Accordingly, the basic concepts are usually quite explainable to others even though they may be not adept with the subsequent math, provided that the teacher really fully understands his subject, and his reasonably articulate.  I came away from this book without a clear idea of what his model of &quot;time&quot; or &quot;non-time&quot; is, and wondered if he might have published his theory before he was ready?<br />If it was the author's intent to emulate Brian Greene's excellent book &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; I don't think it quite reached the mark.  I hope his ideas will eventually become clearer.
B000051VWW|5.0|i highly recommend this cd to anyone that wants something to kick back to after a long day or even cuddle with in the background.this a very soothing cd, not to say i wasn't expecting that from Sade
0141301155|5.0|Roald Dahl was a genius. He wrote so many titles that perfectly captured the sensibilities of young people. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is probably the most familar title of the books he wrote for children. If you enjoyed the Gene Wilder movie, you'll enjoy the book even more. I still go back and read this familiar title from time to time. It's warm-hearted, witty and a terrific read! I heartily endorse it and ALL of Dahl's works.
0679879269|5.0|I honestly can't remember a book that I've savored literally chapter by chapter. Not wanting this triumphant trilogy to come to a close, I'd only allow myself one chapter in the morning when I woke up and one before I went to bed. Having just completed it I feel like my head has just expanded. Pullman continues through the worlds we've come to know with Will and Lyra and takes us to some new and wildly original ones such as the world of the dead, and the village of the mulefa.(Don't ask. The beauty in this is his desciptions of both.) Already I've bought the first book, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; for friends of mine so I'll have someone else to talk with about this.<br />The books have gotten stronger each time out, and this one is the tops. I also appreciated that Pullman has plenty of opportunity to dip into sentimentality, but chooses instead to write with careful restraint; the result being a moving and perfect ending.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|First off, I happen to love Christmas music... all kinds of it.  So while this isn't typically the kind of music I'd spend all my time listening to (though I do own other albums of hers) I really, really enjoy it.  It's different from my other Christmas cds in that it's really modern, upbeat, and funky.  <br />I tend to like the new songs more such as the first couple tracks, \\"Christmas Time\\" and \\"This Year.\\"  Though the gospel vibe in \\"Angels We Have Heard on High\\" gives them a run for their money.  Probably my least favorite is \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\" which just seems kind of blah.  But to be fair there has only ever been one version of that song that I did like!  <br />Overall it's a perfect way to spread Christmas cheer to a younger crowd who might not appreciate the classics as much, but also all pop fans in general.
B00003CXE7|3.0|This movie was a surprising disappointment. The acting was superb. Russell Crowe did a fabulous job portraying the main character, Maximus, and all the supporting actors were absolutely fabulous. The plot was somewhat captivating and easy to follow. However, it seemed to be on the same gore level as Braveheart (but, then again, what can you expect? Ancient Romans had a pretty sick sense of entertainment. I mean, who likes to watch people die gruesome deaths?). Though the actors and writers did an above average job, the directing could have been done better by a junior-high student. The camera was constantly switching positions, and except for a few longer speeches, mostly made by Maximus, the camera never stayed in the same position for more than five seconds. Secondly, throughout the movie, the director always goes to this overly-symbolic, confusing, unmentioned, unimportant scene with Maximus running his hand through a field (what is that supposed to signify?). Though this movie was fairly entertaining (mostly because of Russell Crowe), this is not an Oscar-calibar film.
6304056958|5.0|....but I particulary &quot;despised&quot; Rosalind Russell who played her part with a brilliant balance of wit and wickedness. And while Ms. Boothe's wonderfully insightful play (and this brilliant movie adaptation) may have tried to teach us women a thing or two about tragedies that ensue from the grief we willingly heap upon members of our own sex, she must have been absolutely convinced that any gender rehabilitation was way beyond hope. And my journies through this life will never convince me otherwise.  Frankly, I'd sooner try to reform a black widow.  The odds of success are better.
B000002O51|5.0|Back in 1976 Boston came out of nowhere and took control of the rock-n-roll scene. Of course, this wasn't that hard to do in 1976. But with their high engery, hard guitar-driven sound and VERY sophisticated riffs and lyrics they became an immediate supergroup. Three years late they released their second album, &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; and you figured they were history. Fast forward to 1986:<br />After many years of legal wrangling Boston released it's third album, &quot;Third Stage&quot;. This album brought back the sound of Boston while at the same time sounding fresh, something Don't Look Back wasn't able to do. Between the great power guitar sound of Tom Sholtz and the amazing vocal range of Brad Delp this collection brought forth no fewer than 4 hits. Songs like Amanda and We're Ready display a new optimisim towards love and relationships. Cool the Engines is a great mellow rocker. My favorite though is &quot;Cantcha Say You Believe in Me&quot;. There isn't a bad song on this CD.<br />I would HIGHLY recommend this to 1) ALL Boston fans, 2) ANY Rock-N-Roll fan, and 3)ANY heavy metal fan.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay has definitely come up with something original here.  &quot;Yellow&quot; is a beautiful song and it inspired me to pick up &quot;Parachutes&quot;.  Listen to it and form your own opinion before believing that they resemble Radiohead or Travis.  <br />I am a Radiohead fan (Yorke's name is'nt tattooed on my arm or anything) but I have read too many reviews about Coldplay sounding like them.  Must everyone be compared to Radiohead.  I mean I know they're abstract geniuses who can't be paralleled, but Coldplay really bares no resemblance, besides being emotional music.  If Chris Martin (vocals) sounds like anyone, its Dave Matthews, and even thats a stretch.  Now to piss off all the hard core &quot;Radioheads&quot; -<br />&quot;Kid A&quot; was original but didn't have as many good songs as &quot;The Bends&quot;.  Concerning lyrics, I think hard core Radiohead fans think that everything Yorke writes is very &quot;deep&quot;, even if they don't understand it.  He could mumble a song of four words 23 times and it would still be &quot;deep&quot;.  Yorke would probably be the first to say, that most of his songs are not that complex.<br />In leaving, I recommend both &quot;Parachutes&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot; as stocking stuffers.  I could'nt wait that long and due to selfishness, bought them early.  A word of advice about anything good or bad you hear about music:  Listen to it yourself, your the final judge of what goes into your ear and to quote Chuck D, &quot;Don't believe the hype, it's a sequel...&quot;  <br />Thanks to Coldplay and Radiohead for not being Rap/Core.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A is an excellent CD, quite possibly the best I own. But it's not for everyone. If you're thinking of getting this CD because you're hoping it'll have songs like Creep or Karma Police, think again. This is an all-new sound for Radiohead, and that's a good thing. Radiohead has avoided doing the same thing over and over again, and with Kid A, they've gone a step further and totally reinvented themselves.
B0000508U6|4.0|This is a very good album.  Listen to it.<br />Here is a real mind bender for you, &quot;Travis sounds like Radiohead and Coldplay sounds like Coldplay&quot;<br />And now I'm going to mention Coldplay and Radiohead in a sentence.<br />Buy Parachutes.
0871137380|5.0|Black Hawk Down delivers the look and feel of the intensity of modern combat in an urban environment.  Through hundreds of interviews from both the Somali and U.S. soldier perspectives, Mark Bowden recreates the action as it happened in Mogadishu.  Experience the thoughts and fears of the pilots, the Rangers on the ground, the Delta Force commandos inside the target building, the Somalis roaming the alleys to get a taste of battle.  Move down the streets and back alleys with a squad trying desperately to secure a fallen comrade.  Drive through the maze of avenues in an armored Humvee.  Feel the panic of soldiers trapped in a gauntlet of chaos trying to support each other from becoming overwhelmed by rioting crowds of Somalis.  Fly over the buildings with pilots that possess nerves of steel, skillfully maneuvering their aircraft past anti-tank rockets and sniper fire.  Reading this book provides the same vicarious experience that the pages of We Were Soldiers Once and Young lay bare for the Vietnam conflict.  Read the following excerpt and judge for yourself.<br />&quot;Mo'alim's group first encountered Rangers at an intersection in a Humvee just south of the hotel on Hawlwadig Road.  As they crept up and fired on the Americans, a helicopter appeared and opened fire, killing the eldest of Mo'alim's squad, a portly middle-aged man they called \\"Alcohol.\\"  Mo'alim dragged Alcohol's limp body off the street, and his squad regrouped a block further south, behind the Bar Bakin Hotel. It was there they saw the first helicopter go down.  The men cheered wildly.  They continued moving and shooting, staying about two blocks away from the Rangers.  They were still south of the target building when one of Mo'alim's group knelt in the road, took aim at another Black Hawk, and fired.  The grenade hit the rear rotor and big chunks flew off in the explosion.  And then, for an instant, nothing happened....... Now everyone around him was racing south.  He ran with them, back through his own neighborhood of Hawlwadigli, a goateed veteran soldier waving his weapon and shouting, \\"Turn back! Stop! There are still men inside who can shoot!\\" Some listened to him and fell behind Mo'alim and his men.  Others ran on ahead.  Ali Hussein, who managed a pharmacy near where the helicopter crashed, saw many of his neighbors grab guns and run toward it.  He caught hold of the arm of his friend Ali Mohamed Cawale, who owned the Black Sea restaurant.  Cawale had a rifle.  Hussein grabbed him by both shoulders. \\"It's dangerous.  Don't go!\\" he shouted at him. But the smell of blood was in the air.  Cawale wrestled away from Hussein and joined the running crowd.&quot;<br /> As you can tell from the above passage, Bowden provides a balanced account of the conflict from both sides.  Thus, this book is useful for getting into the minds of the Somalis to understand a third world view of the impact of U.S intervention, in addition to feeling the thoughts and emotions of soldiers engaged in a struggle for survival.  As a result, many readers can benefit from perusing the pages of Black Hawk Down.  Young soldiers can learn about the intensity of a first battle.  Junior leaders can learn about leadership under the most extreme conditions.  Senior policy makers gain an insight into the will and desire of another people that may not welcome American influence into their country.  War story buffs just get the entertainment value of reading a gripping account of modern urban warfare.  Bowden's extensive research and interviewing creates the multi-faceted benefits of this volume.  Read it to further your own professional development.  Understand the enemy; understand your soldiers; learn about the cultures in elite units like the Rangers and Delta Force.  I highly recommend it.
B0000508U6|5.0|It was less than a month ago that I first heard Coldplay.  I was going through the channels and landed on MTV's &quot;spankin' new music&quot; show and they were playing &quot;Yellow&quot;.  Not only was I intrigued by Coldplay's unique, emotional, and strangely luring sound and vocals but I also was in shock that MTV was playing something good.  MTV is guided mainly toward 2 demographics: The &quot;I love boy band/girl band crap&quot; group and the &quot;Fred Durst and Eminem rule crap&quot; group.  It must have been fate to run across &quot;yellow&quot; when I did, because it is few and far between that you can hear anything inventive and &quot;good&quot; on MTV.  What I don't understand is that this album has been on Amazon since November 7th and I just found it today (Dec 18) in stores.  Anyway you owe it to yourself to check this out if you like honest lyrics and beauty in melody.  I do want to clear up some misconceptions about Coldplay:  1.The singer, Chris Martin, sounds nothing like Thom Yorke.  2.The band does not sound like Radiohead. 3.The band does not sound like Travis.  With that said, please listen to it yourself.  Every time a new group comes on the scene, especially with good music, some people feel it necessary to immediately compare them with another artist(s).  I love Radiohead but they are'nt the only band out there with original sounds and lyrics.  Get over it, then get &quot;Parachutes&quot;.
B00004YW6I|5.0|This is just a great rock album.  It is the first cd I have purchased by P.J. Harvey.  I can't compare this cd to her others because I've never heard them before.  I'm glad that I now have plenty of P.J. Harvey albums to get.  The opening song is a good representative of the album.  Straight forward rock-n-roll.  The single &quot;Good Fortune&quot; is a perfect way to lend some good music to the radio.  Finally.  This album represents what I feel SHOULD be on radio these days.  Sooner or later, hopefully.  Anyway, back to the cd.  &quot;A Place To Call Home&quot; has an intoxicating bass line that drones throughout the whole song.  Is her voice incredible or what?  The subtlty of Thom Yorke's backing vocals on &quot;Beautiful Feeling&quot; is just phenomonal.  Of course, it seems like everything Thom touches turns to gold.  Harvey fans - that does not mean that he makes the album.  However, the vocals on &quot;This Mess We're In&quot; is classic Thom Yorke with a twist of PJ.  The bass in the song comes right out of the cd player.   If I didn't mention the production quality before, let me tell you, it's about as good as I've heard in a long time.   Nothing on this album has reinvented music, but it has done what any record should do - maintain great consistency throughout.  I would have to say that my favorite song on the album is &quot;Horses In My Dreams&quot;.  It's perfect for driving on the highway at night.  Hell, the whole album is.  Buy this cd if you don't have it already.
B000002HAF|5.0|My first Pixie's album was trompe le mond, I was hooked. Dolittle came next and I was blown away.  Then the masterpiece, Surfer Rosa, an amazing spectacle of alt-rock before alt-rock was a key search word on your average internet site, before there was an internet!  Every song on this album is brilliant.  &quot;Where is my mind?&quot;  is such a wonderful song, haunitng harmonies by Mrs. John Murphy, coupled with the always interesting Black Francis, or Frank Black, whichever you prefer, still send shivers down my spine.  Tony's theme is an absolutely hilarious song.  Such a brilliant diversion from the tone of the album.  I recomend this album to you the reader, if you're aching for an album to reflect and remember the bygone days of early 90's grunge rock, or if you just want to hear the most underrated band of all time on an album so good that it inspired Nevermind, pick up a copy of Surfer Rosa
B0000508U6|5.0|From beginning to end, this is a great cd.  The beauty of &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, and &quot;Spies&quot;, is enough to by the cd alone.  With the success of &quot;Yellow&quot;, I think this band will be around for a while.  Although there have been singles and EP's from this group, it's hard to find an LP debut this good.  Only few bands can accomplish this.   Many have called them the &quot;new Radiohead&quot;.  I disagree.  They seem to be more like The Ocean Blue.  They are a great band, but their not that similar to Radiohead.  This album seems to be more straight forward and not as atmospheric as say OK Computer.  However, like Radiohead, it seems as though the brits are more advanced when it comes to making music.  There are several bands from the States that could compare to this, but for the most part Coldplay are a force to be watched.  Listen to the beautiful piano of &quot;Trouble&quot;, the lull of &quot;We Never Change&quot;.  A must buy for your collection.  The good news is that if you like this cd, you don't have a lot to collect.  They're still fairly new to the scene.  You never know, the singles may be of great value someday.
B000002KET|5.0|This band, above all others, may have been the model for the Spinal Tap jaunt, but this is an outstanding album.  I'm amazed at how fresh it still sounds.  It contains at least two classics -- the title track and 'National Acrobat' -- and it contains Rick Wakeman, strangely and illegally not credited for his contribution on the early Castle CD re-issue.  The experience must have left a strong impression on him, because it was only afterwards that he began his evangelical Christian ways.<br />This album was also highly influential in the development of Iron Maiden's lead singer, Bruce Dickinson.  I know -- I went to boarding school with him until he was expelled.  This was the album that we would listen to incessantly on Saturday evenings, along with Deep Purple's 'Made in Japan', Wild Turkey and Van der Graaf's 'Pawn Hearts'.<br />But get this album for its own merits.  It is Sabbath's masterpiece.  When Soundgarden released the brilliant 'SuperUnknown', the best compliment the critics could pay it was that it was their 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'.
B000001EL7|5.0|This album to me is as important as Alive! in Kisstory, cause this album is the studio equivalent! Let me explain..this CD may not have all the best songs (one of the many compilations could take that award) but in terms of capturing a &quot;spirit&quot; this is it Kissophiles! The album does contain filler namely &quot;Got Love For Sale&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow and Tonight&quot; but the whole thing is packaged and delivered with such outright bravado it doesn't matter one bit! On the high side we have the brilliance of the title track &quot;Love Gun&quot; and the almost as good &quot;I Stole Your Love&quot; coupled with the experimentation of &quot;Christine Sixteen&quot; and &quot;Almost Human&quot;, the welcome addition of Ace Frehley's vocal debut on &quot;Shock Me&quot;, and more Simmons' tongue in cheek sleeze with &quot;Plaster Caster&quot;. Peter Criss contributes a fine moment too with &quot;Hooligan.&quot; As seventies as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; and &quot;Charlies Angels&quot; this is a time capsule of all things bubblegum on one slab of plastic and a testament to a band at its platinum peak where the essential ingredient was fun...which rhymes with, oh dear...LOVE GUN!!
B000002KFJ|4.0|This album gets off to a ridiculous start: the cover is one of the silliest I've seen, and at least two band members are wearing embarrassingly naff gear.<br />But the music inside is great.  For me the highlight is 'Thrill of it all'.  The music sounds so contemporary, and yet -- and this will put off all of today's teenagers -- it contains next to no offensive language.<br />Iommi is an excellent guitarist here.  Who was best: Iommi, Page or Blackmore?  You can see that the three were playing to broadly similar audiences.  Both Iommi and Page wrote for acoustic guitar, too.  But whereas Page's acoustic is a vital facet of the Zeppelin canon, Iommi's seems dispensable.  Sabbath without the acoustic was still Sabbath; Sabbath without the heavy electric guitar would be commercial suicide.  (Has there been a Sabbath Unplugged?)<br />If you only buy one Sabbath album, get 'Bloody Sabbath'.  But this comes a reasonably close second.
B00000AFDW|3.0|Okay enough is enough and please take this one for what it is instead of who played what, what sounds like what, who sounds like who and whats missing etc, cause after all we have been blessed by firstly the Reunion Tour and secondly the fantastic gift of one more studio release..and its meant to be and is FUN!! This CD is nothing more or nothing less than something extra to savour as the end draws near for this great band. Things open big time with the title track &quot;Psycho Circus&quot; which is one of two songs on here truely deserving 'classic' status, signed, sealed and delivered with a Kiss. Gene's &quot;Within&quot; is maybe oddly placed second up but its a sleeper and after a few listens your hooked, and yes it does sound like a Carnival of Souls era song, but surely thats to be expected as that CD proceeded this one! We should expect, in my opinion, that the band members will pull from their vast musical backgrounds at this point in their career. &quot;I Pledge Allegiance&quot; is a big slab of bubblegum fun that Paul can write in his sleep, take it or leave it. Classic number two roars out of the gates with &quot;Into The Void&quot; , thumbs up to Space Ace! The Convention Tour perhaps was the seed for &quot;We Are One&quot; next up by Gene which is a kind of acoustic ditty which is near on impossible not to hum along to. I don't really have feelings one way or the other for &quot;You Wanted The Best&quot; though the shared vocals by all four is fun making it worth the time. &quot;Raise Your Glasses&quot; is like a sister song to &quot;Pledge..&quot; and is as good. Peter does a ballad in &quot;I Finally Found My Way&quot;... and I'm standing on a box now... and do I have everybodies attention cause...I LOVE IT! So there! &quot;Dreamin&quot; is vintage vocals from Paul and the closer &quot;Journey&quot; is way cool almost Elder like with refrains back to &quot;Within&quot; and &quot;Psycho Circus&quot; all of which reminds me a little of &quot;Only You&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; from the one and only concept album from the masked ones! Now I admit this CD is a little varied in styles,or eclectic if you've swallowed a dictionary, and in some ways comes over like a Best of the Solo Albums deal, but really who gives a toss 'cause at least its new and its got a square case that has a Kiss logo on it and everybody in the band has a star turn, something I've waited for for a long time!uot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; from the one and only concept album from the masked ones!

B00000BKE0|1.0|This album is absolutely appalling. By any other act at the time it would have been deemed passable, but by the high standards set by Maiden it is an absolute turkey. There is not one track which comes even close to anything else on any previous Maiden album. I don't know what went wrong here but the entire band sound like imposters!! I was dumbstruck by how bad it was when I first bought it. I have been a Maiden fan for two decades and this CD was the nadir for me. Thankfully things have improved greatly since. Take heed and avoid this CD like you would a case of the black death.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Generally I dislike Japanese anime films.  I suppose this is due more to my own misinformation about the genre as well as the incomprehesible success of the Pokemon phenomena and its ilk.  However there are two anime films that I have included on my personal list of truly great cinema; the first is Isao Takahata's powerful anti-war film &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; and the second is Hayao Miyazaki's &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;.  The film contains some of the most impressive and visually stunning images in an animated feature (or even a live action film for that matter) that I have seen in a very long while.  But make no mistake, this is no family fun Disney film.  The story and its themes are quite complex and you will have to have an above average attention span to fully appreciate it (a little background in Japanese mythology couldn't hurt either).  While I have a long ways to go before I could call myself an anime fan, films such as &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; have demonstrated to me what the genre is capable of and I look forward to seeing other films by Mr. Miyazaki and other filmakers of his caliber.
B000002KO1|5.0|The Pretenders debut album is essential.  For years i avoided this band for thinking they were some classic rock dinosaurs.  Shame on me!<br /> From the opening track &quot;Precious&quot; they come out roaring.  They carried the torch of punk through the 80's and so many bands owe them: Elastica, Sleater-Kinney, even No Doubt.  You can see Chrissy sneer from behind her bangs during &quot;Tattoed Love Boys&quot; and &quot;Space Invader&quot;.  <br /> And of course &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot; i now see as one of their best instead of an over-played dinosaur.  Couldn't radio discover the rest of the hits?  Well, you must have this !
0446608955|5.0|I'm only 14 and this really touched my heart to the max. This book really shows that at any age you can fall in love, no matter how you felt before everything can change and when it does it might be too late. Landon is a little lost boy and finds the way to grow up in the most beautiful way, falling in love. Jamie is so full of joy and did not diserve the rude comments given to her but does not let that stop her from caring for each and every being. I, 100%, give all credit to Nicholas Sparks for the most beautiful story that filled my eyes with tears of joy and sadness. The story will always mean something special. Read and find out what I mean. Don't pass this book.
B000003TSP|4.0|I have owned at least 3 copies of this LP. Loaning this album to friends that I want to explore the &quot;trip-hop&quot; genre, usually leads to them never being returned. I got turned on to their first album, &quot;Dummy&quot; by a store display, it became an instant favourite. This album, eagerly awaited by myself and some of my more &quot;in&quot; comrades, proved at first to be somewhat a disappointment. There were no &quot;hits&quot; on this album. Nothing mainstream radio could really sink its teeth into. I cast it aside for a few weeks, only to pick it up again and play the album in a different mood. Less expectations of &quot;Dummy&quot; in my head. What I ended up hearing was a &quot;band&quot; not a producer in his room. The sound actually said, &quot;this is a band called Portishead&quot;, not a producer and his cronies looping tapes and LP scratches. The production is amazing, a wide open solitude I have never heard on anything else in the electronic genre. This album is more like Portishead than they ever were before. What The Cure do for euro-pop, Portishead does for electronica.
0679777547|5.0|I bought The Club Dumas over a year ago at a used book store, but I didn't get around to reading it until this past weekend.  Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  I was content to sit curled up under a blanket on my couch reading it for hours at end.  One enters another world as one reads the book.  Instead of merely getting superficially involved in the characters' lives, one wants to live them.  I wanted to feel an old book in my hands - to touch the paper and gently turn the pages.  I sympathized with the main character's need for gin and a smoke (and I don't smoke and I hate gin).  The book is intellectual, but not overly so.  It addresses the postmodern concepts of interpretation of texts according to what the reader brings to them, but does so in a way that is closely tied to the plot and therefore fasinating.  I admit to having never read The Three Musketeers (or ever even watching one of the movies), but I was able to follow the references to it fairly well.  It has now been added to my reading list as a result of The Club Dumas.  Overall, a highly enjoyable and stimulating book that I recommend.
B00000099Y|5.0|I honestly own over 1000 cds with my brother and this is one of the best if not the best I have.  If your a rock fan this is a must have.  I garuntee you will love it I dont know anyone that doesnt.
6302424739|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Compared to typical Hollywood movies, this one is slow, but that is what makes it stand out above the rest.  The story is touching and gives one a glimpse into post WW2 England.  The letter correspondence is always witty and enjoyable.  Buy it, rent it and enjoy a nice quiet evening with a fun and relaxing movie.
044022165X|5.0|I had to read a book for my 10th grade IGL class and I happened to pick up The Rainmaker.  I needed alot of pages so I picked it up, I opened it and started to read and I just couldn't stop, it was just so good,  I love to read John Grisham's books but this is the best one I have read yet.  I like the lawyer that Rudy becomes and the way he won the case against Great Benefit.  Rudy was not interested in seeing the Blacks son but then when he met and talked to him he felt better about it and he really liked him.                      By: Jesse Cooper
6301697707|4.0|Because I watched it when I was a kid. Me and my friends liked this movie just as much as PRINCESS BRIDE. We watched it at every birthday party. It was SO scary. Of course now if I saw it I'd think it was stupid, but at the time those tremors gave me tremors. The idea of these giant worm-things burrowing through CONCRETE WALLS and eating people horribly with plenty of effects and blood and gore was horrifying. I don't know if it would be as scary for anyone now.

0767819446|5.0|I just loved this movie! At first, I rented it, but my Mom took it back before I even got to watch it,and she took it back for my behavior consequence. Then my Dad rented it the next week, and I got to watch it, since I didn't have any behavior problems that week. You see my parents are strict about Rated R movies. My Dad says that I have to act mature if I want to see those kind of movies. But it turns out that my Dad liked it also. Can't wait to get my own copy.
014028009X|5.0|Life for the slightly neurotic, modern thirty something single girl in  London is not easy. This novel, recommended by my son, is funny, and  had me in tears (laughter and some kind of common female bonding thing).  Bridget worries about her weight, her health and her love life. Her  mother (who is going through a mid-life crisis, leaving her husband for  a man named Julio) tries to fix her up with a man who wears a patterned  sweater, but Bridget and her boss are in the midst of a torrid e-mail  flirtation.<br />  Hope they make a movie of it! Good for fun reading. I bought this book while on a holiday in London, stayed up all  night when I should have been sleeping my way through jet lag! I also bought the sequel, in  case we didn't have it over here - imagine my surprise to find out this  is a top seller in the US!
0783235666|5.0|THE BIRDS is a wonderful film, intensely touching with it's much analyzed symbolism of human fragility. It is also scary with imaginative attacks and wonderful sequences. The Tides Restaurant sequence is a wonderfully black sequence of comedy, terror, and logic ending at the only conclusion: if it's true, &quot;we haven't got a chance...&quot; The subplot of Lydia, Annie, and Melanie is wonderful to analyze. Every time you watch or read about this film, you learn more about it's symbolic undertones(coincidental or intentional, I don't think it matters). Watch again and again for it's cool and cold atmosphere and clever sequences and directing by Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, who definitely suceeded in this film. Personally, this is my 4th or 5th favorite film, the first four being REBECCA, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, and SHADOW OF A DOUBT, and REAR WINDOW. For the VERTIGO, PSYCHO, and NORTH BY NORTHWEST fans, I love those too, not too far behind.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This album is clearly a great compilation of hits; however it lacks the overall mood set by the individual albums.  However, it is a great album for casual fans who may not wish to invest the time or money to acquire these songs from their original albums.
