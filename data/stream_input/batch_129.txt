B00N58KRPM|4|Works great and is very sturdy, easy to install.  The only downfall is that it is intermittently beeping when no button has been pushed or the handle being touched. In all fairness it may be a loose wire from the one connection you have to make when installing. I will provide an update when I take it apart and look for the loose wire.
B008BLKI2U|1|Garbage. Literally the biggest waste of money ever!
B0034BRJ7O|5|so far so good only been 1 month but it was great fit and it works great.
B00S7YTYR6|1|when opening the box the first impression was good but when reviewing one of the bars comes with plastic detached, so it would not buy!
B000HUCOZW|5|Fit well on a 2002 Volvo S60 2.4L Turbo.  Make sure to clean both surfaces (engine and ETM) before installing.  It was easier to install by removing  the plastic cowling from under the radiator (2 screws on the little triangular pieces and 2 bolts for the rest).  You'll also have to remove the turbo tube and radiator fan.
B00AZ4SU9O|5|These were easily installed and great for deflecting rain.​
B000M5NNQ6|5|I used this on my truck and noticed the difference within  a few miles. I recommend this product to everyone.
B0003040ZS|5|*received just like we should great job
B000C59ST2|1|This DOES NOT come Close to fitting a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Extremely happy with this purchase. Got many compliments.
B00BXM3WSQ|5|Please try on as many helmets as you can. This fit me very well, but others that were reviewed to be similar didnt. Anyways, this is an awesome helmet and the price is a steal (mine still included a pinlock!)
B00LBNEEF2|1|its like 2 inches long. waste of money
B008NGMFZG|5|exactly as advertised, good job.
B00VSQAQC2|5|I wasn't even having a problem with any of my vehicles when I bought this. However, just two days after I got it and before I had even pluged it up to anything I got a check engine light on my car. I had no idea why. I pluged in the OBD2 scanner and it read. Engine vapor recovery problem. Possible loose fuel cap. I checked and sure enough the fuel cap was loose. I would probably have gone to a repair shop to find out what the problem was had I not had this. Paid for itself as far as I am concerned. Repair shop people will tell you anything and charge you for it.
B000BQSIWK|5|Product trickle charges my motorcycle battery perfectly.  It will display voltage & battery %.  I've used this to charge a battery that drained to full charge but it will take hours.<br /><br />Do not buy the added items that Amazon recommend, they do not work with this product unless you do a CRAP TON of soldering/modding.
B006B1ZXWC|5|great part fast service
B0085XH58O|1|I'm not sure what happened but I have had this emblem maybe a month and it's now all yellow were it was white.
B007M0ZCHW|4|Does the job, however, the buttons are very sensitive and I accidentally randomly set off the alarm or unlock the tailgate which never seemed to happen with the original shell.  Just have to be extra careful not to hit those buttons!
B005OV5JGA|3|I am giving this 3 stars because it's an OEM part that fits my vehicle. Having said that, I had received 2 defective items. The 1st time, you could tell the milling process did not make a clean break from the molding machine so it was slightly off the mark as to where the cylinder matches up with the ignition. I had a replacement sent to me and the mold was clean. HOWEVER, I had brought both locks to a professional locksmith to have the key fitted. BOTH internal cylinders did not have the correct tolerances to allow the brass plates (also called wafers) for the locking mechanism to work properly. I had to do a mix and match scenario. They used my existing lock cylinder from the vehicle with the new plates/wafers to make the lock actually work correctly. So buyer beware!! Keep your original OEM cylinder to see if you can do a hybrid fix.
B005OGYPK6|5|Everything I've brought was ok and satisfying except the cup holder don't like the extension on it like it with just the clamp on it
B007J7E42C|5|It seems really well made and a fun thing for cookouts. Pats fans will love it.
B00WDSVEE8|5|Excellent sun protection and easy to apply. The flip up works great.
B0009IQYXU|5|good
B00NBN1C78|4|First off, the description should be a bit clearer for those who are browsing for jacks/tire changing kits.  This is a set designed to be mounted to trailers, specifically the tongue of the trailer.  If you are looking for an emergency roadside kit for your car, keep looking.  As it is, the Extreme Max 3005 is a well-designed, sturdy kit that is held within a thick steel box that bolts onto the trailer via U-bolts.  Some reviewers have questioned the durability of the bolts, I cannot comment on it since I've only had it a week. I have used both the scissor jack and the tire iron (which has a neat collapsible design to allow it to fold and store into the box), and they work well.  Will it replace my floor jack and long handled-wrench?  No, but in an emergency (for which it is designed), it will definitely do the trick.  The jack was stable and smooth.  As with most compact wrenches, it may be a bit short to provide much torque when removing stubborn lug nuts, but that's the trade-off.  All in all, a good option for an emergency kit.
B00G5MSU9U|5|Great product
B002IV6ND2|5|Just as described, tho it took a very long time to receive from Amazon, even with Prime. Works well....worth waiting for.
B00GHT6SF4|5|Fit good, had my 10 year old push the rod through while I held the lid and springs. Easy install
B0006SH4NC|5|This is the best of the detail spray products.  Really like it.  1 gal size is economical, much less expensive than the 16 and 32 oz bottles
B000JFL83Y|5|This is a well made tool. Locks into each position securely and pulls the rear drum seals on my dual rear drums without flinching. I recomend this seal puller to anyone wanting quality.
B002JJX2DW|5|Very pleased!
B00D9C2CDO|3|Decent quality, but far from waterproof. I was afraid of this leaking rain in during my trip, so I put each pack in a tied trash bag first. Rain water did get inside but the trash bags kept everything dry.
B007I8Q3M6|5|Awesome
B000C427MI|5|The Engine Saver
B00RPSXG60|5|great
B00NPKEOZY|3|Its an average product. You get what you paid for. Not ideal for temperatures above 90-95F.
B00CBW66H6|5|It was a perfect fit and looks great
B0001L0DFA|4|Easy to twist and very durable. Perfect for watering my tomatoes.
B0006VORDY|5|Arrived on time and worked as advertised.
B000OZS9Y0|5|Used these on my 2012 wildcat. Work great and really hold up. You can't beat these for the price!
B003VB0XIE|5|Works great keep all chips and rocks and dirt off the front of that towed vehicle.easy to install and remove and store
B00H8DQVDM|5|Amazing product! easy installation!<br />05' Acura TL
B000W0RQ8C|5|Sturdy and attractive, this little lock is almost invisible, but what is visible looks great. Also, it is quite strong and does not protrude and get in the way of other functions.
B0027ETAHQ|5|Fits perfect. Quality is good. We have it installed on our 2004 Honda Accord. Performance seems to be very good.
B00L32KR70|5|fit truck fine ,love it ,but they should keep the light.
B0085L65RI|5|Very happy with my wing centers and they look really good on my car. They gave  the car a different look and they also came on time.
B00K889FCI|5|A little water, a few seconds scrubbing, a swipe with the cloth, and it's like I have brand new headlights.  I'm very skeptical of &#34;as seen on tv&#34; products, but my headlights were extremely cloudy and I didn't want to spend money on new ones.  It was getting to the point where I couldn't see well when driving at night, so I tried this on a whim.  It really does work, and they give you everything you need to apply it except the water.
B0000AY9W6|5|They work very well.
B00KTIYXLU|5|needed to replace the old part which no longer worked and had to read the instructions carefully to make sure that i used the correct year and model....but had both replacements up and working in less than 4 minutes...was well worth the money and would definately buy from them again
B00GSAUHB8|5|Very light and easy to handle when putting it in place. I also like the quick fold up the wire construction offers. Once folded it fits very neatly between your seat and the center console. This is an excellent product so far as ease of use. Time will tell how long it lasts.
B00CGTVCIC|5|Perfect fit, nice and comfy!  The cover has great workmanship - it looks and feels like a way more expensive one. It was a pretty tight squeeze to put it on, but we managed and it looks wonderful. We didn't find it to be odorless upon arrival, but the odor disappeared within two days of getting it on the wheel. Here in Costa Rica we all drive old beaters, but the addition of this wheel cover makes our old 4Runner look a few years younger. And we all know how important it is to look a few years younger... Oh, and I should add - it's always hot here and getting into a parked car is never any fun. But so far, the steering wheel cover has NOT been too hot to touch - a definite plus!  Don't hesitate, buy this one!
B007G7PV6I|4|This is a high quality &#34;extended performance&#34; full synthetic motor oil I've used in my 15 Lincoln MKZ sedan 2.0 Ecoboost and my fiancé 15 Lincoln MKC SUV 2.0 Ecoboost. I run this oil for 10,000 mis every time with either a Mobil 1 or Royal Purple oil filter for best results and optimum filtering. I also highly recommend Pennzoil Ultra Platinum full synthetic motor oil and use that as well depending on which u get at better price. Both are excellent altho the Pennzoil may be slightly better according to bobistheoilguy.com
B000E7SY16|5|Works well.
B006GJLHJW|5|Exactly what I need
B001NYWVWC|5|goog
B007TJXHZA|5|Fast shipping. Fits perfectly.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Very good quality
B00KXPR9WE|2|Directions were unclear and the pens were difficult to use, the finished product came out poorly.
B0013LUBSG|5|Love them easy to install n came quickly
B001NIAH9W|5|Nice Heavy duty Hook, fast shipping
B002YKBPXA|5|This is a nice product to have as I go for my early am walk. At night makes a nice bedside back-up for my alarm system.
B004GE1N66|5|Well made (in Taiwan).  Fits perfectly. Very reasonable price.  Will buy again when there is a need.
B0007M1FNM|5|Everything I needed! I was able to put my 95 Honda A.C.E  in the bed of my F150 truck with the tailgate down and still pull my pop up camper.
B00K69YXS0|4|Good cup holder that managed to securely hold onto both over-sized drink cups and irregular shaped bottles.  The only drawback was; the clip that slides inside the window slot would catch on the window if the window was down, and then get ejected when the window would be brought back up.  We just learned to keep hold of the unit if we needed to raise the window.
B000CGFNAO|5|Timely and as advertised.
B00MYFNOYS|4|Fits nicely in a RAV4. The back ones are a bit small, but good for the price.
B0023VFB2G|5|Seemed to be an exact replacement. And the price was way better than I expected. Thank you.
B00CD6VV7A|5|great
B00MH4663C|5|Fast delivery. I put in my truck and wife's SUV. She left the key on and used it 3 days after she got it. Worked great.
B00LTMULV6|5|Everything went really well. The part arrived in a timely manner in good condition. It was the correct part and now my generator is working for the first time since I bought it used. Five stars!!
B00EVPLXSS|5|Works
B0002F9YIC|5|excellent
B00NDIML08|4|awesome stickers and they really stand out.
B006GFU4K4|3|I had to use (1) mounting bolt from the Support package and (1) original bolt on the bike.  The Support angle doesn't match the angle  of the rear shock.  The Mfg. did not provide any mounting instructions.  I have not tried to fit bags as yet.<br />David
B0096SK0PW|1|Good try... No am limited fm look great though
B00LEBLI82|3|These led lights are very bright and a great price. Customer service took care of a issue I had and were easy to deal with.
B0059KHB6C|4|Good kit, quality construction and works well but very pricey. That being said it gets constant use with a 4th gen iPod on a 2011 Vaquero. Only reason it got 4 stars is the inflated Kawasaki pricing.
B000VEJBW8|5|greatong looking tail lights. But if you have a back up camera? Make sure you get buy the 6 watt led reverse bulb because the factory bulbs are terrible on these tail lights. I couldn't hardly see at night but the led 6 watt bulb fix that problem.
B007AAUTG8|2|I installed this on my 2011 F150 pickup. The installation is easy and only takes a couple of hours (taking your time, could be done faster if you are one of those &#34;experts&#34;). I have only had this camera installed for a couple of days and have two problems (complaints?). First the picture quality is poor, not sharp, as advertised on line and on the box. No amount of tweaking the contrast and brightness seems to help. Second there is a delay of about 4 seconds from the time you shift into reverse before the screen comes on. Very annoying. I intend to take these issues up with the manufacturer, and see what they say. The jury is basically out. Also I think the 4.3 &#34; screen is too small for a truck. 7&#34; would be better. I am beginning to think you have to raise the bar to $250 or more to get the quality you see on the mid to high end SUVs with factory installed BU cameras. I will edit this later if I decide to return it.
B0068MWZCK|5|This is the OEM filter for 2009-11 Hyundai Genesis 4.6L V8.  It fits the oil cartridge perfectly as the manufacturer is also Mahle.  Some after mkt products will fit correctly, but will get warped due to the plastic end caps if you torque the filter cap to the recommended 25nm.
B003XWYLHK|4|amazing! i received them and the first day i installed them and i felt a difference in when i brake and push in at high speeds. there is no front push anymore. it contacts just great w my legs and keeps me in position. definately recooment this!
B00E1SOMDS|5|fast shipping and can't beat the price
B000NU5LP6|5|VERY stinky but a great price and seems to work great.  In combination with mobil 1 synthetic 75w-140 oil in my 2002 ford explorer's differential it has made for a much quieter ride.
B004VPX1TM|5|Original part.
B00M62QFHC|5|Excellent Fit, could be scratched at it is not made of hard rubber, but some kind of dense foam. Still great quality
B00D2QL0DU|5|Just changed some fluids in my 370Z. Works perfectly for siphoning in differential fluid, transmission fluid, or just about any fluid no matter how thick.
B00MGV0HZ4|5|Fits exactly as it should and really reduces the amount of bugs we get on the windshield.
B00080QHMM|5|My old Accutire gauge got stolen. It work flawlessly for 10 years so when replacement was needed, went with what I knew.<br /><br />The new model operates and handles the same. The nice &#34;new&#34; feature is a red backlight which make reading the gauge easier! Nice upgrade!
B00GJKA7WQ|5|Fit perfectly on my drivers side rear door handle.
B000JFHMRU|4|Great
B000ET9SAU|1|When it worked, this unit performed as expected, but after owning it for 18 months, I grabbed it out of the trunk today to top up a tire and when hooking it up to the valve stem, the plastic swivel crumbled in two, before I could even apply the expected force to lock the nozzle onto the valve stem.<br />A weak, poorly made non-repairable piece of plastic renders the unit dead and unusable.  That swivel needs to be metal or a much stronger plastic.
B005CHT4W6|5|this is good stuff, however beware that the cans are only 4 quarts, not 5 like most other oils that come in a jug. some people under fill their car because of this.
B000P7O5DG|3|A/C adapter gets quite warm when plugged in. We are cautious where we plug it in for that reason.
B00TUNSV2W|5|I love the 303 brand. It's made in the USA, and doesn't contain harsh chemicals.  Since there's the added UV protection, I've used this all of my outdoors furniture that contains vinyl.  It cleaned the items very well.  My yard items are in in the sun over 75% of the day, so I'm hoping for lasting protection.
B0016VGUGU|5|High quality at a better price that the Toyota brand version. Very heavy duty. Stays in place. Nice no slip surface keeps items from shifting. Looks great
B003SRWHTE|3|Bottom is hard to put on but I do love them
B00TA5ECJQ|5|Works really well with gas (with filter) and oil (without filter.  Easy to work.  Very satisfied with product.
B002E5HMSC|5|It was delivered quickly and was exactly as promised. Thank you. I'll definitely buy from the seller again.
B00DEP3A8M|5|a must have
B00MB0EXGE|1|Was really nice when we got it but faded very fast
B0009N0W60|3|look good
B000O5DUP8|4|Wires a bit short on one side and to long on the other side for the rack I use them on. But got to fit (barely). Other then that they snapped right in and works great.
B00T0WQH2E|5|easy fast and durable. great product
B007NGB3FK|5|Extremely happy with this purchase. Got many compliments.
B00OV7HKA6|5|Handy piece of  equipment to have available, so much smaller than a boost box
B0012TZ04E|5|Extremely happy with this purchase. Got many compliments.
B005DTKNZU|5|Does exactly what its suppose ot do.
B00NF1T6Q0|5|The part works well. Now the cruise control buttons work correctly but the horn still had another problem. Too much resistance through the steering column. Some graphite lubricant fixed that.
B00COYNVPQ|5|Just as described and arrived promptly.
B006WQ9SYU|5|I bought this for a 2010 Jetta which was not listed as the vehicle this would fit.  It looks good and fits pretty well though not perfectly.  Not the fault of the product so I have no complaints.
B000H2W270|5|Good solid unit. I have reordered this a few times.
B004Y9BAOS|5|Great for the price
B0012ILZAS|4|plenty loud. Only wish there were more matrix's so I wouldn't have to drill new holes in the deck!
B00NPIBLZW|5|Extremely bright.  Tried some of the cheaper leds from amazon first which all turned out to be a disappointment.  The JDM bulbs are great and I plan to buy more soon.
B007D46HZ8|5|VERY easy to install.  no issues at all. peel and stick.  looks nice.
B000C9WJ8K|5|I used to replace the filter on my John Deere L130 yard tractor.  It's a simple install, and being able to see through the filter housing to the filter element is a nice bonus  I plan on continuing to use this product at my annual services.
B00II5YADC|5|Fantastic
B00FVROT3Q|5|quick ship and just as discribed
B0017T7WHW|5|good product
B00WS25ZCG|5|Good
B009UODIOM|5|Super fast shipping (arrived several days earlier than promised (yeah)!  Had small hiccup:  the manufacturer-packed box was missing parts.  Tony from Lead Feet Performance contacted the manufacturer on my behalf and got parts direct shipped.  Exhaust was super easy to install with hand tools and very detailed instructions.  Am very happy with customer service (and throaty exhaust note from my '15 Taco)...
B004JB7900|2|I have to give this a negative review because there is a pamphlet that explains the tensioner fits 2003 (if i recall correctly) and above, and for earlier years a mod to the rear timing cover is required. This is nonsense because when in the midst of a big job I don't want to have to stop to fiddle around with pamphlets and taking a dremel to my timing cover. This slipped my mind and when I figured out the part doesn't fit I already had a lot of stuff assembled that would have to come off to back up and mod the timing cover to accommodate this part. So I re-used the tensioner because it is less than 2 years old and not defective. If I had a 10 year old tensioner this would have cost me an hour to backtrack, and I am not equipped with a dremel (roadside emergency repair 1000 miles from my home) at the moment. Amazon should not say &#34;this part fist your 2001 PT Cruiser&#34; with a green indicator if a mod is required.
B010ATFLP4|4|Not only are bulbs used for car lighting, but also for over the counter lighting in many motor homes.  The original lighting puts out an extreme amount of heat. These LED's are cool to the touch and do (if not better) the same job as lighting for the kitchen counter.<br /><br />Only downside and why I didn't give 5 stars is that I wish they had &#34;warm white&#34; .  Price is right and so far no complaints.
B007XZJTWK|4|These are really good for 40 bucks, quality is good, easily installed, the only concern is about low quality bulbs that comes in the box, one of them burns out after just 3 weeks ! But fog lights are very good and I recommend them. They shipped fast.
B007ILANWY|5|perfect for our pontoon.
B001FKEMGM|5|Did not fit on serpentine belt tensioner of 2008 Toyota Sienna.  Did work great at both idler pulley locations.
B00HFDH1KC|3|I three starred it because the adjustable part to make the wheel camber seems cheap and it bent when I tightened it so I will be switching the out these are kind of temporary they work the rest of it is stront but I wouldn't recommend cambering the wheel with these.
B00N58M6CO|5|Easy to charge.  LED indicators reflect charge.  LED flashlight maybe a gimmic, but never needed it yet, but it could come in handle with a dead battery in the dark.  I've used this as a USB batter for mobile devices.  I've not had the opportunity to use it to jumpstart my 2010 Sienna.  Thats the primary purpose.  Review will be updated when I finally use it for that.  Pros: - lightweight - convenient carrying case - multiple usb / charging adapter connectors for different mobile devices Cons: - none whatsoever yet
B00UU1DPRY|5|Easy to set up, and the automatic search for satellites saves time and annoyance.  Any splitter on the cable reduces the signal and may prevent reception.  For prewired satellite RV's make sure your wire connections are tight.  Mine were not and I had to spend an hour with Dish before they suggested connecting the cable directly to the receiver which made the receiver work correctly but required snaking the wire through a window.  When I tightened the cables behind the connection panel in the utility center, the receiver worked great; disappointed Dish did not suggest this at the beginning.
B00MFZYUJU|5|Great purchase
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Good deal for the price
B0080C90OM|5|Great Deal
B009FPCCHU|5|Great alternative to a ratchet and torx bit.
B000EQ8XLI|5|Correct part
B00JBIAU7U|5|Great product no instructions the first light took about an hour and the second took about 15min.
B00S6QETTI|1|Installed pump and cycled. Pumps instantly started pouring fuel from every seem of the part except the exit port like it was supposed to... Seller then wanted me to pay shipping to send them back the defective part!! Do not buy!!!
B004RT0BPO|4|1 star less than perfect due to price. It's a gas can.
B002PYBZJO|5|Used it a few times and helped to identify many problems for friends vehicles!
B00KATZ0HY|5|My grandaughter loves it better than ugly black.
B00J3218PC|4|This wax cleaner is recommended by Honda VTXOA so I decide to try it.  So far it is fairly effective in cleaning and waxing in one application.  But I think the separate wax compounds are more durable and longer lasting.  I think its hard to develop a product that will do multiple functions and have it also be long lasting.  .I think there is no free lunch.
B0085KGOIE|4|Nice to have when camping without sewer hookup.  If camper sat higher it would be easier to use.  Have to help the discharge hose to get everything into transport.
B00RP113TE|5|All I can say is thank you this product it was perfect my local auto parts stores wanted more money and a longer time to get it but you came through I will buy another one for a spare soon thanks again.
B013DWF8CG|1|DOES NOT FIT 2003 CHRYSLER VOYAGER- DO NOT BELIEVE THE DESCRIPTION- IF YOUR OUTSIDE WINDOW CHANNEL HAS A RUBBER NUB ON THE OUTSIDE NO WAY THIS WILL FIT- EVER- SEE THE PHOTO- INCORRECT FITMENT NOT AS ADVERTISED
B004A6BVGC|5|Perform as expected.
B001EOV3Q6|5|Fast shipping. Strong product
B00AHJZBCG|5|Nice and light. Good distance lighting...... Easy to recharge.
B005DUTCAQ|4|Looks awesome, very bright. Cargo light doesn't always turn on. Bulb a little oversized and doesn't make connection.
B000XBEJ7G|5|Worked great- direct replacement
B00B7GRFS6|3|They work fine but difficult to put on.
B00PTVHT1I|5|Love them
B000CQR3XO|5|Looks very nice and would be tough to cut off.  So I can lock the front with the factory lock and the rear with this.  Hopefully this will make it enough trouble to steal that the schmuck will pass it by.
B007IV6AFI|5|works as described
B0049Z2TII|5|Purchased to replace incredibly, unbelievably noisy original unit on GF's 98 Tahoe. Best money ever spent, installed easily and immediately solved the noise problem.
B00JLPNHJQ|5|My husband loves this!  He's quickly started vehicles and his toys with this jump starter.  It's small, easily portable, easy to use, and he takes it with him when he's fishing (boating or ice fishing).  This is the second one I've purchased for him, so he can have one in his truck at all times, and another one for his &#34;toys&#34;.  He's rescued more than a few people who's car batteries have gone dead.  I got one for my Dad too, and he loves it.  If you don't know what gift to get that man in your life for a gift, consider this.
B00429NKWK|5|Clear instructions.  Just wish it could be available in six packs for me and my family.
B00IQFDBI4|5|Item as described.  Fast shipping Thank you
B00SQNJXME|4|Nice finish, good air flow
B00Y1HQBYW|4|Great alternative to dealer fobs.  You just need to place the battery in the correct spot.  No specific spot outlined on the inside.  Price was great too.
B000H7WAKY|5|Perfect fit.
B00D4AW82Q|5|Fits perfect although the instructions were probably the worst i have ever seen.  I had to take it to a local truck shop and have them do the install but once they installed it looks awesome on my 2013 F150 Limited!
B00B11SVEY|5|Very good product
B0022ZWYHS|5|Lens was just as expected and shipped super fast.
B001YJ2EMS|3|I got the chrome Iridium for my '12 GP Edition R1. Plastic feels cheap and fragile. Sides look like they were adjusted with a Dremmel tool, uneven. Surface is very easy to scratch, looks a bit warped too. If I paid more than $45 I would've been upset. Try a Puig next. Wouldn't recommend it.
B00B7GC50Y|5|Mounted this on my boat (On road holder grill frame) to trigger charge my battery. This way I don't have to worry about my pump draining the batteries on rainy days.<br /><br />Totally works!
B0006IX87S|5|water tasted great.
B0009IQZH0|5|Nice size, work great.
B00U3A9AKI|5|Great
B001PYLHZC|1|This is NOT the correct kit for a 1989 Oldsmobile Delta 88
B0010HI40K|4|As advertised.  Direct fit in my 2004 TSX with a random misfire. I installed the two coil packs and the misfire cleared.  I will probably buy two more of these, as the car is old and has a fair amount of miles on it. (150k) These fit exactly and  appear to be good quality.
B001G5YKYK|5|This is what you want.  Factory fit, works as advertised.  Great price.  Can't say much more except that my trunk is now working.
B002UBZL4C|5|Fast delivery. Good price. Fits opening. Meets all expectations. Will buy again if needed.
B000ET3X42|5|This Plug Fit my Chonda GX200
B00C3NA3H2|5|great product exactly as show
B0029TQDLA|1|Junk. The hanger portion of each one snapped off within 2 months. What a waste of money.
B00SLKGK1Y|1|Returned as it did not come with the clutch as described.
B00ARBSJV4|1|Really wanted to like this delay switch. Was, and the key point is was, going to use this to delay start one of my NAS servers on a power up from a power failure but the switch arrived non operational. Would not even power on. Dead as a door nail. Also the dial had too much glue in the center and a small crack. Tried to return for a replacement but Amazon was out of them. Had to go with a different and more expensive switch.
B004JVLWBW|5|Item as said, they work great for lots of things, i use them to install accessories on my recreational toys. Don't for to test leads if you use them like i do. positive and negative switch.
B00ZFRIU1E|5|excellent
B002N5J7WC|4|Works fine
B000P6VMEC|5|Heavy duty, locks with a barrel lock and works great! Love this thing. Use it on my motorcycle but have also used it to lock things down like a pressure washer to the bed of my truck. Very handy!
B00VJQ766U|4|Worked great
B005FKAMTY|5|I gave these brakes a 5 star rating, no they are not top quality, but they are indeed exactly what is described and are of good quality for the price.  Everything came on time and in order.  Installation was a breeze, everything you need is in the box.  They perform well for the price, these rotors and pads are a good deal, no complaints here.
B00B19SEBQ|5|Perfect fit 2014 Accord sedan..
B0000AQQX3|5|great product
B000C54180|3|not like old moog products.  for those looking for product of origin, per the es3256 I have delivered 8/2015 its made in china.  Had I know or even thought a moog product would be from there I would have purchased a different trw/proforged/lemforder tie rod for my 850.  That being said the grease cover does seem to be blue polyurethane with removable clips.  No zerk fitting though.
B001TPT4L6|4|as good as the original
B00A192QT8|5|Easy to install and fits my car perfectly. Nice not to have to pay full price for the Mazda version.
B000N3CP7A|5|perfect fit
B00WQHMMVK|3|This was a great asset on our 7 hour driving trip on vacation.  It kept things cold and was accessible to me.
B00S5FE9MC|5|as advertised
B003N6BI5O|5|Haven't put it to use yet but am looking to this large pulley to slow down a vent fan. It has all the right dimensions.
B00G66KNZY|5|I got this helmet because I saw how many people it saved and it looks bad ass. My brother decided to take my bike out without me knowing and ended up crashing at about 50 mph. He has some scrapes and bruises but luckily he was wearing the helmet. Sadly my bike is totalled but my brother is alive
B00IY2CR3E|5|Worked perfectly right out of the box n our 2010 Chevrolet Traverse
B00LPIU4GG|3|These do NOT fit the Grand Cherokee with flush factory rails - They require raised rails.
B0058J4URC|4|Great condition, but like most aftermarket parts it didn't fit 100% correctly. It took some work to to get my brake light mounted. A few minutes of fiddling it did lock into place & they look great!
B004RCQSZ8|5|work on the motor perfect. Didn't take long at all to put on. great job
B0049MVF7C|5|arrived on time, easy to install.  Great!
B00269DMV2|5|Good quality - works as expected.
B000NWAA50|4|Part was great.
B00TECMGTI|5|The on-the-fly adjustment is perfect. so far so good.
B007QBQJHY|5|Perfect upgrade for my Buick Regal grand national.
B001TJ6N8O|5|Worked for me! It arrived fast and is good quality!
B00CXOR59A|5|It is perfect for display on my car.
B002UC1AYQ|5|Product exactly as described!
B005N6Z3V2|3|Quality was fine. However the 3XL I purchased fit me like XL. Would purchase at least 2 sizes above what fits you.
B0087WS4MO|4|Works as expected.
B00A8K3E5K|4|Arrived quickly and were exactly the right size .
B00E63TI32|5|Works great for hot or cold.
B00AKH3A14|5|Delivery on item was right on time and it was easy to put together
B00ELN8ET6|5|Great quality magnet. Didn't stick it on my car, though. It was perfect for my range box (50 cal big fat can.)
B00LG7EZA2|5|Perfect!
B007V2EK1A|5|Purchased as a gift for hubby.  He had the cheap floppy silver windsheild protector that barely holds in with the sun visors.  This fits perfectly Crown Vic 2011 just as stated covering the large car window.
B001CE4HY8|4|Packageing was not the best and one support was slightly bent. The supports were fully functional and operated flawlessly.  I only gave a 4 star rating due to packageing. Barker slide out supports
B007A246J2|1|Starter was defective. Had to pay return postage and a %20 restocking fee. The box that the starter was packaged in had been cut open previously. Maybe it had been returned by someone else? Rareelectrical stated there was nothing wrong with the starter and charged me a %20 restocking fee. I would not have gone thru the huge job of removing it from the tractor and paying to ship it back if it was a functioning starter. The starter I replaced this one with cost a little more but works perfectly. I would not buy from this company again ever ever ever.
B004I0LSY0|4|Fits good
B005NLQAHS|4|Works great for my 2004 volvo s60r
B00J62XB18|5|The instructions are the greatest, but once you get past that the product is very nice.
B00ML0843C|1|Installed these in my John Deere Gator, not bright at all. More of a decorative running light.
B00KVHXBXU|5|Great product, awesome sound,  easy installation!
B0002JMYKS|4|Awesome!
B0067P2E7O|5|Perfect thanks
B0068C2K16|5|Works great!
B000CPCRS6|5|Seriously one of the easiest and cheapest modifications you can do to your vehicle. No drips, no spotting, and comes out looking evenly coated.  Saved me $344, the price of a whole tinted tail light assembly.<br /><br />Here's how I painted it, no sanding or clear coats needed:<br /><br />███  1. REMOVE TAIL LIGHT FROM VEHICLE<br />Easier than it seems.  Youtube it if you have to. For the most part it's just 2-3 nuts securing it, then one main electrical wire you unhook / unclip. Then pull the tail light straight out, with a little force.<br /><br />███  2. CLEAN TAIL LIGHT WITH DISH SOAP<br />First clean with hot water, then dish soap, then hot water again, then towel dry.<br /><br />███  3. CLEAN WITH VINEGAR<br />This helps make sure there is no grease on the light. Towel dry again.<br /><br />███  4. MASK OFF REVERSE LIGHT<br />If you're so inclined. I used standard blue painters tape. Try not to touch the tail light any more than you have to. Clean one more time with vinegar to get rid of any finger prints or tape residue. Towel dry.<br /><br />███  5. SPRAY 1 LIGHT EVEN COAT OF PAINT<br />Start from top to bottom, then go bottom to top.  Let dry for 10 minutes.<br /><br />███  6. SPRAY MULTIPLE COATS AS DESIRED<br />For all the coats following, I sprayed from top to bottom, bottom to top, twice. Allowing 10 minutes of dry time between each one. For the smoked effect like pictured on my Ford Edge, I only did 3 coats total. On my Hyundai Elantra (not pictured) I did a blackout look with 4 coats.  Any more coats using my method might be too dark.<br /><br />███  7. LET DRY FOR AT LEAST 4 HOURS<br />Before handling and reassembling.  According to bottle it fully cures within 24 hours.
B009SI2SCS|5|It's a chain, what else is there to say?
B00YMLGUF2|5|Unexpectedly high quality part ... looks OEM. Great price, great deal.
B00NMXM76C|5|They were exactly what I wanted.
B000COC67E|5|Good quality.  Looks exactly like what is pictured.
B001HLFWXQ|4|Stylish but practical.

B000C2SCGK|5|Excellent.
B00UYYO3A0|5|Perfect for holding my phone and blue tooth headset while I'm running around. Perfect fit.
B007USQWWA|5|Easy to install/remove.  OEM with Toyota logo.
B008N8ILQG|4|have not yet used, seems it will do the job i need.
B008B9V71S|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B004AH16Z2|5|Appears to be a very well engineered and manufacture bearing, and arrived very quickly. Both of my original rear bearings were making noise beginning around 100K miles, so I ordered these after a lot of research. Amazingly quiet. Don't make a mistake and buy cheap Chinese bearings that won't last. The labor to install these, whether you do the job yourself or pay a mechanic, makes the purchase price difference insignificant if they last well over 100K miles, which I expect. I will always go with SKF, and just bought SKF fork seals for my dirt bike. That's next weekend's project.
B00G1Y5YBE|5|Perfect fit. Looks good. Haven't seen any others around.  Mounting instructions a little too generic.
B0087YLGJ0|1|I returned this, it did  not fit my car like it was supposed to.
B00FQ0ROZS|4|Great light.
B00B9EZ03S|3|not as good as OEM, seems flimsy.
B0031HXZOW|5|Received the alternator very quickly.  It looked brand new out the box and I had my mechanic install it in my 2007 Dodge Caliber.  My car started perfectly and is quiet once again! We will see how it holds up!
B00K16FPO4|5|WORKS GREAT
B00GTJJ57K|5|Working perfectly
B0026KP9DK|5|hard to find in white
B00G6CIX1E|5|Excellent suplier
B007CTQKVU|5|they worked just fine
B00AE1M9YK|5|Just what I was looking for...!!!
B00EHIPMAY|4|Bright, easy to install and my dodge charger didn't need the anti flickers.<br />I feel like I robbed them for getting them so cheap.
B009YYPHRO|5|This is my fourth change of rear shocks in my Mazda5. This one is a keeper. I had to wait for some time for delivery but man! What a difference. The car feels a lot more planted on the road and much less car sick kids.
B00684TAYY|1|very pleased with everything
B0031ZDU62|5|Has been working great. Terrific price. On time delivery. I would buy again if ever needed
B009099P4E|2|It looks great but will not fit. I'll make it fit since returning it will cost me $6.57 so there is no point when it costs half the price to return it I'll keep it and bite the bullet..
B00XZD25HU|5|Very impressive quality. Exactly as advertised!
B009DA95M2|5|Great helmet!
B007KLNFQ8|5|Awesome!!!
B0080N3BDC|5|very nice it looks great on my bike!!!
B005J3L35O|4|does what it was designed for,  very convenient,  looks durable
B00HF40N06|5|Good Product
B0068FWYMS|4|Light weight and works well in the rain. Prompt delivery.
B005KDO8U0|5|These bulbs are much brighter at night and have a greater lighting distance. They are not to bright like some after market headlight bulbs.
B00BSKYM82|3|It's ok, quick and easy, but honestly I don't know if I will be easy to remove when it will be all pitted and dirty. Plus on my front bumper, it react funny to water and washes. It seems to come back normal when it dries.<br />I would totally recommend normal 3M clearbra but it will cost a lot more, especially if you needt to have it installed :(
B007JZKBVW|3|I bought these to replace a burnt out Philips H7 CystalVision Ultra Headlight Bulb, of which I got nearly 4 years' use on low beam in my '09 BMW 528. I also wanted whiter to closely match the very white LED bulbs I installed in the angel eyes. The package states a 5000K brightness; I don't doubt it, comparing them to my Avalon's HID bulbs.  As the title states, they are not brighter, at least in the low beam projector lens. When I install them in the reflector lens high beams I will report back.
B002UZGCNC|5|Works great.  Works with BMW 325i.
B000BPZ338|1|Does not fit a 68 cutlass.
B000KYX65W|5|Quick ship - programming directions were written by someone with a wry sense of humor, but could have been a bit clearer. After a quick google search to supplement the programming directions, I got this programmed in about 10 minutes and works like a charm!
B00I7996N8|5|Good product, received quickly!
B00KC66OMK|5|I just needed something to replace the original plastic door lock knobs which disintegrated/crumbled after about 7 years, as have several other original plastic parts. These replacements are metal and I'm expecting a much longer life span out of them.
B00WZ9ZPPY|5|fit perfectly and easy to install!
B006MX7ZB6|1|HORRIABLE FIT FOR MY DAUGHTERS KIA SPECTRA, HEAD REST COVER WAS HUGE AND IT MAKES THE CAR LOOK CHEAP.. THREW IT AWAY.
B00J52R3AE|5|Just what we wanted
B00IWO4K8O|1|Didnt' fit my truck. I figured they were all the same size, but I was wrong. This does not match my seatbelt male/female connectors (too small)
B0052FREQQ|5|Great product and delivery
B0058O7QMI|5|Fit nicely and works great.
B00L6UVU8Y|1|Did not work. Will update review if product is replaced at no cost.
B009PIIRVM|5|Fit nicely , designed for my car.
B003EGO3OQ|5|Fit like the origional. Works wonderful.
B0066SHPVW|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B000RN04VU|5|Very nice for the price...
B000C02Y0M|5|perfect OEM replacement rotor at low cost.
B002J858HQ|2|I guess it smells like leather, but everybody has their different idea of what leather should smell like. New car smell? Not really. A bit too chemically. Went with the Yankee Candle tags, which are a bit better (more of a new leather luggage smell).
B00RDB1PAS|2|It's made of plastic. The letters are stickers. It looks like the letters are cut out from electrical tape using an exacto-knife. I've had it on my car for a month so far, in rain and sunshine, and it's still like new, so it's not too bad. If I saw it at a store I would not pay $20. I would maybe pay $5. I'm keeping it because I'm too lazy to send it back.
B001J7CO02|5|Wow!  Loud!
B000CN4ZY2|1|Edelbrock changed the design of this model so we could not use it unless we &#34;replumbed&#34; the car. We sent it back
B00029WT08|5|It fixed the blind spots that I had with my 2012 dodge 1500 pick up.
B00KTHU1QM|5|Easily programmed at dealership. Great savings over OEM
B001DKT0DO|5|so far so good.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Great product! lightweight and durable and is going to make our next road trip way more comfortable on the inside! Love it!
B00449Q110|5|Goes right on and runs right out of the box. I did regulate the fuel pressure at 2.5 psi, the holley regulator works decent. This on the 152 ci 4 cylinder engine.
B005TINFBE|5|This item has a great stabel quality.
B002MPV5H8|5|Love the helmet, when j got the box I almost thought the helmet wasn't even in it. Fits good and doesn't get too hot.
B0024GJ4IM|5|For its price, by far the best automatic 10-amp charger that I've seen. The alternator checker is a freebie that performs just as well as the charger. I think it's suitable to leave in circuit for cars in long-term storage.
B002696FA2|5|I own a 1966 Shelby Cobra with a 460 C.I.D (550) HP engine.  A couple of days ago I noticed a small puddle on my garage floor.  At first I thought it was just the overflow tank but a closer look at the top of my engine I saw there was a leak from my inlet water neck hose which is connected to my manifold.  That night I researched some Cobra Forums and found it was common especially in hot weather.  They recommend using Bar's Leak as directed and it will stop the leak.  I put it in my recovery tank, added 50/50 anti freeze to recover the tank to it's correct level of fluid and started my car.  I moved it out of the garage and let it run for about 15 minutes then took the car out on the road for another 15 minutes or so to get Bar's Leak completely through my cooling system.  Got home, looked underneath my car No Leak.  I opened the hood and checked the inlet water neck, No Leak.  I'm a true believer in this product.  Just make sure to follow the directions and drive the car to get it all though your cooling system.
B000C8Z9Z6|5|These were exactly what I wanted, I had open headers which was way too loud for the area I live in. These gave the car a great tone, but retained the muscle car sound. I was actualy surprise how much they quieted the car. 1593 Ford Mainline with a Chevy 383 Stroker and wild cam.
B00CXADXYA|5|Best bike ever
B0085KGOIE|5|Good quality
B005S575O6|5|Easy plug and play install.
B004GCBE1C|5|Perfect .!!!
B00DD0ZO14|5|Love this
B000GZELFY|4|The top nut does not screw all the way down, it will get stuck mid way down and rotate the &#34;rod&#34;. So I put on the one from my old strut, which screwed all the way down.
B00E8TJQQS|5|Great product!
B005SB0JJS|1|Order only came with the front sheilds.no rear sheilds bummer.rip off.
B00VNBDWPK|5|Awesome!  Fit perfect in my 2015 Subaru Outback.
B00G620ZVU|5|These lights are extremely bright! I love them! do not let the price deceive you! Yes they are a lot less expensive but the quality does not show! I bought 2 sets of these and a buddy of mine loved mine so much he had me order him a set as well!
B001S8Q174|5|Worked Perfect
B00TEFL1W8|3|If you are installing on a Saab the top reservoir over flow does not fit. I had to cut the plastic and add the old plastic piece instead of the rubber one that came with so that it would go into place. Other than that it was fine
B0101F35HS|5|Came on time and bright as the day is long .
B000KZ2AHG|5|As expected , easy directions
B00EDG0MTG|5|Used this on my 2011 Silverado 1500. It worked as described and beats buying a whole new door panel. I recommend not using superglue before installing the screws, I used a product called JB Plastic available at most automotive stores. This creates more plastic area (theoretically) and binds stronger so that the screws wont pull out of the panel again. It worked great with no flaws (no noises or clicking like some described in their review). The picture I have posted will show white areas, that is the JB Plastic that bonds to the panel and handle.
B004XERS2W|5|Great product !
B007772HG4|1|Not real good was easier lining up as usual.
B006GLEBIO|1|Lights lasted all of 3 mins then half the roll went out. Amazon refunded my money tho.
B001EYEUDE|5|This item fit my application as expected
B00D9C2CDO|5|Great product....did the job with no leaks...and really inexpensive...
B00FOVXX2W|5|works great....was shipped with a missing part.  HI LIFT...fixed the issue within 24 hrs  great CS from HIlift.
B002L7FY1A|5|Great Item
B003AOEAHC|4|Product runs too big for the padded JK rollbar when attempting to fasten velcro straps.
B000COPBT4|5|Bought this to replace missing converter on one of my vehicles. Got this installed at a local muffler shop and has helped with engine running better and emissions system working properly. To me it is worth the money spent.
B00W513QPS|1|This carberator did not fit on my Honda mower motor as it had said it would.  My son instead took the old carberator apart and cleaned it well and put it together and did use the gasket from the new carberator since we had it.  Now my mower runs well.
B001B7TSSQ|5|Quality product, just as pictured
B000C5C9ZM|5|Works just as well as the OEM one did!
B000EGAM0I|5|I bought this product because of the reviews. Not sure how you can tell. I use it in everything I own. 40 diesel motor home, BMW convertible, 745-I BMW, 2000 Ford E-450 with a 7.3 diesel.
B0062XB56M|5|fit is perfect, ordering is easy
B00JALACGM|4|WORKS BETTER THAN STOCK MY BIKE IS ELECTRIC SO IM NOT SURE IF THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ACCURATE FOR ME OR IF THIS PRODUCT IS JUST NOT SUITED FOR MY TYPE OF BIKE ( ZERO S )
B007T12Q2I|2|holds in moisture
B00ML1D1PW|5|They work well and came on time. However the day I got them I found the exact same item at harbor freight for $9.<br />O well...<br /><br />But the are a good product used it on my boat trailer so that I don't submerge hot lights.
B005JWCPC0|4|falling apart after 2 years but not badly
B00GT2FUB2|5|I ordered this for work as a mechanic. I use this to jump start a vehicle, then leave it under the hood to drive the vehicle in with a bad alternator. Much smaller than other jump starters that won't let you close the hood with the jump starter hooked up.<br /><br />I tested on a Toyota 4 cylinder vehicle with dead battery and it jumped the vehicle 5 times with still juice to spare. Also, the unit had 4 lights of battery level left.<br /><br />One note, the last picture that is on the description with all the tips in not accurate. That picture is for the XP-1 not the XP-3. This XP-3 does not come with all the tip adaptors that the picture shows.I believe that the picture shown is for the XP-1. The difference is that the XP-1 will charge your laptop battery, while this XP-3 does not. Not a big deal. The XP-3 does come with a cable that has 3 ends for usb charging, the old 30 pin iPhone plug, micro and mini usb ends. Those 3 should handle most 5 volt devices. If not, you can always use your own usb cable... Read more
B001KP4DNE|1|The gun itself is junk and the cups fall apart and seller will not and stand behind the product they sell
B005JXH6YQ|5|Great product for summer or winter. Very satisfied and fast ship! Will purchase more of the same.
B0027DSNRU|4|Tire cover is beautiful and vibrant. The covers I have had before this one all had a bungie cord on the back to fit and hold tightly against the wheel.  As such, this is my only disappointment with this product as the cover has a rope and zip tie to hold it in place and is not too convenient to remove.
B000JFHMZW|5|Works good
B004V4GRYY|5|These are excellent. They are, in fact, the ONLY part of my New Beetle that I can count on functioning like it's supposed to. They are heavy duty and I love the Beetle emblem on the side of each mat. Now, if only I could just keep that car running...
B0096BAYGY|5|Perfect fit, just as I would expect from Denso. Box got beat up in shipping but product was ok!
B00M1Y3KZA|5|Dexron 6 is good stuff and the price is right for Havoline.
B00B8ZHD74|5|Fits perfectly
B001TO1D48|5|Inexpensive, and works superbly!
B007V2BJ5K|5|Awesome sturdy looking sun cover. Works perfectly for Lexus RX350
B001CF1A7O|5|Needed a d ring and this was a good price.
B00B1V9OUE|5|I'm loving this helmet.  As a Harley rider, I've always worn a half helmet, but with getting older and having kids now, decided I wanted a little more protection.  This helmet is a perfect combination of safety and &#34;looking cool&#34;.  The other huge bonus is the decrease in wind buffeting.  With the half helmet, by 50 mph my head would start getting buffeted around, even with a windshield.  Not so with this.  Even up into the 80+ mph range, the wind passes easily around.  Definitely glad to have made this purchase.
B0026PGN3A|5|Fit just right, delivered sooner that promised.
B002EZITFC|5|Works great!  Included instructions do not work for bulldog so just follow original owners guide. No big deal.
B004J316PW|5|This replaced the original radiator on my 2001 Pathfinder, and so far so good. Keep in mind, if you have a manual, this radiator comes with outlets for the automatic transmission cooler. You'll have to plug those since the manual doesn't have a cooler.
B0000AYZE8|5|This kit done the job...fuel pump kit was easy to install and works great..Thanks
B004C5P50Y|1|This used to be a decent product for the money. When they changed how the headset plugs into the bottom of the unit they ruined it.<br /><br />No matter how you have it positioned you WILL rub the bottom of the usb cable and pull and pull on it until you ruin the cable or the port. They do not and will not fix this issue and Torc (their main vendor) will not do anything about it other than offer to sell me an updated unit at full price.
B00I548U0K|5|They look awesome
B0021UQZBK|4|Works great
B000C1IO82|5|Easy to install, Mustang running like a champ.
B00U2ADLW2|5|Absolutely love this item. My car wasn't running and I thought it had a certain problem. Once I got the scanner, I was able to detect the problem which was something totally different than I originally thought. It ended up saving me about $700! I would definitely recommend this product to everyone! Completely invaluable.
B00C7XVXOU|1|I have a 2007 suzuki forenza. This did not fit the holes on my hood. 1 bolt on the inside right is in the wrong spot. The other bolts line up. IT DOES NOT FIT '07 FORENZA. All part numbers were right and should have fit.
B001BB4LBG|5|Good
B0072VB810|5|Excellent
B002UM8XFA|4|ok

B00WO8424G|4|Nice little bit of extra storage. Holds cell phone well.
B00II8HHP2|4|Quality product, just as pictured
B001G679VK|2|wrong part
B00P2EQ8FU|3|It was shipped from China directly, so be aware that it took a month to deliver.  The quality was not impressive, but just functioning.
B00B9W4HDO|5|Very nice finishing coat. I could actually see the wrinkles smooth out on the leather so I know it was soaking into it
B001CK4BVQ|3|This Bag mounts high and the end mounting slots are not long enough the catch three windshield fasteners.  I am going to plot and punch my own fastener openings to place this bag in a more desirable position. Other than that this bag is as expected.<br />David
B00HRH9H9O|5|good product
B002DU3TTO|5|good product,great service
B008XSUET8|5|Good mat. Fits perfectly.
B000V9ATEW|4|easy to install as replacement and works great
B00VGL5WV4|5|Just what I needed/ordered.
B00842A7F4|3|The parts themselves are perfect for the job but the shipping took over one month. Thus while I had everything else (bumper, and paint), it took an extraordinarily long time to do the job.
B002MYLB1Y|5|Accurate Description, Well Packed, Fast Delivery & Great Price
B008CRYB76|5|Great product.
B00F60TRLW|5|Worked well? Repairs chip and was much cheaper than a windshield repair crew.

B001P2DQOO|5|Perfect fit
B00480BWCI|5|great product, every camper should have a set of these. delivery was as promised.
B00BD4YPEY|2|The seat covers showed that they would fit my car but they don't. I had to rip the seat covers just so they would fit. I definitely wasn't a happy camper, and I won't be ordering from this company again👎
B00KHVFCHI|5|Very happy
B008IT8TAI|5|Sounds great, especially when idling. Looks great especially compared to the old rusted stock muffler. As others have mentioned, it is very weird that it was designed where the drivers side pipe sticks out about an inch farther than the passenger side. I used some ties wraps to push the rubber hangers to the extreme end of the metal rods and got it down to about a 1/2&#34; difference and will try some things later to even them up. Definitely buy the pliers to get the old muffler off the rubber hangers. Even though it was extremely well packed, mine (like others have said) had a small dent on one of the exhausts that had to be there before it was packed.
B00NRLCJPI|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00QVPU9FE|5|Perfect replacement for my Haulmark cargo trailer.
B00S0W5T1K|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B000BRF4Z8|5|It was a perfect fit.
B00CLFSV62|3|The decal stated is 5&#34;x 6&#34; The decal is only 6x2' It will work,but diappointed.
B006HHRJFY|5|Great Price
B00IEYDZTC|5|These are really nice, USA-made rims and high quality tires.  If you want a matching set order them together otherwise you might get a different tire and/or rim if ordered separately.  I ordered one to make sure it would fit my trailer, then hit the &#34;Order Again&#34; button for a second but got a slightly different rim (same tire).  So, I ordered them again in the 2-set and now have a matching set of rims and tires and two great spares which if I don't use will be my replacement tires someday.  But for long trips it's very comforting to have two brand new spares, these are a great deal and worth every penny!
B002HXUFPI|5|Great fit - easy install.
B001RAQGXC|5|Used this on a 1974 Corvette.  I would definitely get it again if needed!  Did the job right!
B001FDTZO8|5|very good
B00429NKWK|5|This is what you need
B0007M1UO6|5|worked great no swaying at all from camper
B000ET525K|5|I love it.
B00WFHY674|5|So far so good on this product. I've only had it in my 6.6 duramax for about two week's now and haven't checked mileage but it looks to be better for sure. Quite a bit more throttle responce, power and smoother shifting from the tranny! Very pleased at this point.
B000GU076Q|1|Two of the holes under the seat did not line up on my 1992 RM 125.
B001HZPWG4|5|Thinking to save some money and go all DIY I ordered a full set of struts for my Honda. It only took watching a couple of youtube videos and a two hour struggle, I got everything installed and put back together. The strut is a noticeable improvement to the old strut. Having the spring on the strut ahead of time made it safer also.
B00VQUXXWA|5|I live these car sun shades. Before I had these my youngest daughter would always complain about the sun in her face and now that we have these there's no complaints at all. They really do the trick. I love how easily they fold up. I would definitely recommend this product.
B00449RJ8E|2|wrong part
B000V2Y4FE|5|Fit like they should and sound GREAT, shipping was super fast! Highly recommended
B00OXPXUAK|1|The adapter was not able to connect to my car's computer. After messing around with the torque app for about an hour, it would still read that it was unable to connect. I've looked into the cause of this and most people say it is because this device is a bad clone of an actual elm327 device
B004NOSXN0|4|Nice product with hard plastic
B001FEOQQO|5|I installed these on my class c motorhome they fit and performed as advertised
B006X98A7C|5|Correct size, installed easily and works fine.  No complaints.  We will see about lifetime.
B007BU5XI6|5|met all expectations ,shipper and truck driver was super guy .
B0006309AM|5|Excellent.  This filter replaced one of the same that was 10 years old.  The new one fits like a glove and certainly enhanced the performance of my silverado.
B009ZQ12F2|5|Nice
B00I4BNTLE|4|These look great on the jeep I would order them again.
B00JUX1DRW|5|Works great with iPhone 6 with case easy to install. Looks good as well
B00KB47G9I|5|Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but it appears to be several times better than my previous jump starter.
B00LNDSKJG|4|Works great and easy to install!
B003ENE6LO|1|Didn't fit my car. Didn't say that when I bought it. I can not return it according to the return policy even when it is Amazon prime, I waisted my money.
B008S1D0C8|5|Good quality.  My daughter loves the design and it fits her well.
B000CPCBF0|5|Like I said in a review for the transmission fluid. Can't go wrong with Redline!
B00063023G|5|satisfied
B00IJJP7VG|5|Great sticker put it on the back of my helmet.
B00DFFJYYK|5|We loved it it worked out perfect for our camping trip.
B000VZF6YE|5|Works very well... Easy to read
B00Y3OJ6FE|5|Got this for my wife, she loves it and it showed up quickly
B00MN92QI0|5|Works great
B00CH6T18C|5|Have a new 2015 just wanted to soften and protect the leather. Seems to do the trick, Florida weather play hell on leather
B006MDH5J8|5|Very heavy duty hood. Used it to tow someone out and had no issues. Highly recommend.
B00E9GCV30|5|Awesome product.  I use it every day!
B0091FJYES|5|The light cover fit perfectly! Thank you!!
B00LNOV0V0|5|Perfect cover for the price.  Easy to operate.  Nice clean look.  Our truck is black, so it looks nice and seamless.
B001N0D60C|4|I like it , my cat loved it, haven't seen it for a long time. Only he knows where it is.
B000UVUAFO|3|It's a little more complicated than i thought it would be.  Haven't tried it yet.
B000GRML5O|5|I'm very very happy with this windshield. I can do 75 mph without the wind whipping my head around or my bike. I looked at many other windshields and this one had only good reviews and is way cheaper than the other out there. So I highly recommend this shield. The install took about 35 minutes and was a little hard to understand the instructions at first but I'm very happy with my purchase.
B003LFPV5U|5|Just what my old 1st gen Dodge needed to get rid of the turbo lag I was having with the other more radical fuel pin. I would recommend this to others that have run into turbo lag issues with other high performance modifications.
B000CRCTR8|1|Three weeks on car and already bad
B000066OC7|1|Although I did not buy this at AMAZON but at EBAY.. This product really sucks.. I weight 194 and used this at the bottom of my extra pad. The is a terrible product.. It has shrunk in width to 1/4 because of my weight.. and I am not that heavy...Its a waste of my money and time...A roll of paper towel would be a whole lot better.. Aug. 2016 - I purchased &#34;TravelMate Coccyx Orthopedic Gel-enhanced (Medium-Firm) Comfort Foam Seat Cushion (Gray)&#34; last month for my back when I drive my SUV - Honda Pilot - 2013 model.  I drive my car continuously for 4-8 hours straight 5-6 days a week and having the Travelmate was an eye-opener. My back pain 80% less and I do get sore when I get out of the car but within a few minutes the soreness is gone.it very comfortable.. I am also buying one for my office chair..  You won't regret it..
B0117R06V2|3|It's not as good as previously made product made in US.
B001TJ3HUG|5|Works great and smells great.<br />Not over powering smell.
B002OUMVWY|5|seems good have not used yet but looks solid
B006WF5KC0|2|After sitting on the shelf for 8 months I finally got around to using it. It was blocked from working out of the box by the mfg. Had to call them to get it unblocked. After all that I was only able to use 2 of its features, speedo calibration and power settings. Everything else was unavailable for my vehicle. Save your money and get a real programer.
B003TTYUHS|1|After using for a couple months, the cap links due to print coming out.  The Irving is oversized and does not go back in.. I have two of these and this has happened to both within two months...very disappointed... Find something else. Amazon prorated a new cap for $7.72 but replace us $ 10.  Should not happen after two months.
B00D3OBPLI|5|It was just what I needed if you are changing your back handle chances are you have a rusted back lock just buy this with it!!
B00D3QZADU|4|fit and finish are great.  Just like stock but better.  If you use your ATV for work like I do, you need these.  Both front and rear.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Keeps the black car w/black interior cooler. No more being burned by the seats or steering wheel. I even figured out how to fold the thing to put back in the sack
B00061SGZO|5|same as a 500$ matco set but awesome
B004NH0MYU|4|Works as described. Expectations were met.
B00GH88YZM|5|Hard to find and great on ice
B00105656M|5|My three year old grandson was thrilled with this. It's very sturdy.
B0072GV0AE|5|Excellent replacement door seal for my 1981 Ramcharger.  Seal went on easy, there is goo in the bottom of the channel strip, making the application of contact cement unnecessary.  Excellent fit, easily fit all the way around the door.  Channel attachment has metal reinforcing strip to make a very secure fit to the flange.  I'm very impressed.
B0040ZDVFC|5|Great price and received it early
B001C625I6|1|THE PUMP I RECEIVED IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE ON THE PICTURE!!!
B00GJ1K0RC|5|Perfect fit and fast service
B001RJN56Y|5|Smells like bubble gum. Refills fit the air spencer cartridge I have very well. Items come in scent less bags, but are not vacuum sealed - which is a good thing. They usually last about 3-4 weeks in the car. Try keeping them out of direct sunlight because they dry faster.
B00IY24DPE|5|fits perfect and was extremely expensive.  Cheaper than the local auto parts store.
B00U3NIZJ2|5|well made, loud flasher plug. has the same tone as a fork lift backing up. its great if you forget to turn off your blinker a lot. lol. Only problem with it is its not waterproof. took my scoot out for a ride in the rain and it burnt up.....could have probably been prevented by wrapping plastic around it. Great shipping time
B0058KYUWQ|4|Worked great
B00SR1QEAY|5|I think this seller has shown great character in terms of the quality of product he produces.The carburetor was the perfect match for my ATV i like the design because i never faced any problem while installing it.So far no fault has occurred with it.For sure this is great product worthy every cent.
B004BWU8H8|5|i woul of likes to see a formed foam insert come with it that can be cut to fit whatever is being stored.  otherwise the quality was top notch for the price and installation was simple
B0080B4FV6|5|Exact fit....good price
B00AF232NK|5|This solved a problem that had been bugging me for ages.  My BMW 530i (E39, model year 2002) had a dashboard warning showing the right rear tail light out.  But I checked numerout times: that tail light wasn't out, and neither was the right brake light.  I tweaked wires.  I cleaned connections.  I considered buying a lighting module.<br /><br />Finally I learned that when the E39's dashboard was designed back in the late 1990s, center brake lights hadn't yet been mandated in Germany.  So when they added the third light to the car, they just told the lighting module to deliver its warnings to the right rear light indicator.  Fast forward to 2015: MY CENTER BRAKE LIGHT HAS BEEN OUT FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS.  I never noticed.  Nobody told me. I never got pulled over.<br /><br />When I went to check the bulb by pulling the socket out from its little housing through the trunk, I found the bulb fully frozen and corroded to the socket.  Not sure how that happened, but a visit to Amazon and a little over $20 got me a new socket and a pair of new bulbs.  Problem solved; I'm legal again, and I don't have to look at that warning light anymore.<br /><br />Moral of the story: if your dashboard says you have a light out, you probably do.  But it might not be where it says it is.
B00E40SZT0|5|Fit perfect!<br />Good quility
B000NHUKJG|1|After trying two of these cables, neither of them work with any of my vehicles that the scangauge cable works with.  I think it's just a cheap knock-off that is missing pins in the RJ45 connector end.  This item is also listed as by Linear Logic (Makers of scangauge) however it is a cheap knock off part.
B0028JPECA|4|works just like it should - a little bulky so may not fit all style of lighters, but works for me
B000EPZJRU|1|Bought this for a 2005 dodge durango 5.7. When I first started the durango up the fan was engaged. Didn't think much about it but when I was driving down the street the fan remained engaged all the time. It took more throttle to get up to speed and more throttle means more fuel consumption. I'm already getting 10 mpg! I removed it and returned it. I must have received a defective one but returns through Amazon make online shopping so much better. Hope someone gets a working one.
B000CLLA5G|5|2006 Taurus.  Great Value.  Good braking performance, no squeak  Plug-and-Play.
B001L9XW9K|5|Depeche Mode is my favorite band. When I bought my truck, I was looking for a decal to put on it. This decal looks great on my back window, even with the windows tinted very dark.  Easy to apply.
B00ODLTC56|4|Great lights for my 02 wrangler
B005CWR5PO|5|put on an old cart i bought and it fired right up and runs like a champ.
B0043AV4NK|5|Sounds epic on my 08 scion TC. My god. Not loud, just very deep. Turns heads for sure. Get this. Its nice. At first it sounds loud. But after a few days it adjusts itself and sounds perfect!!!
B00L4OOCKK|5|I purchased the super spammy at a county fair and I absolutely love the product. It works exactly as mentioned and it holds so much liquid! Great for carpet spills, drying cars, liquid spills. Highly recommend the product!
B0039LDF4A|5|Did the trick.
B003VXRPL0|3|Why did they kill the blue?? Retarded, you can't tell when the bleed is done, that is if you change brake fluid once a year or three for that matter. It make no sense!<br />One can is not enough. You will need two cans of this this overpriced juice from Bavaria to make your brakes completely flushed. I use a Motive Products power bleeder, never buy the plastic cap. It is crap, get the aluminum cap for the reservoir.<br /><br />Or save money and buy DOT 4 from Prestone. Same boiling pointing...
B004GEW2WK|5|Very good item as described ,just took a lot longer than to get here
B000F44M0A|3|I like the aerosol kit better.
B000KKD2YQ|5|These worked perfectly to replace the rollers that I had. I had to slightly ream out one of the two insert pieces that came with them, but that wasent a big deal. This 4 pack, is the same price as 1 roller from the local boating store.
B002MAMBDU|5|Great stuff took all overspray off
B000EQDYQC|5|works as described. Nice to have the 2 year warranty.
B007KFMJRA|5|The easiest install I've ever do.
B00BD6RUAI|5|Looks Good, Fit well, Easy installation.
B0009N30EQ|5|Plenty of room fit the visor's perfectly
B00QL2XCKG|5|I like it. Fits well.
B000C7VYJW|5|Installed without a problem.  Perfect fit. Had the old one out and this one in with the car running in less than an hour. Thanks!
B00LMP3XKQ|4|Good fit and does the job. The sunshade protects the small speakers in the dash area from the sun.  It does take time to fold the shield correctly and maneuver in a small car like the Fit.  Wonder how long the shape will stay rigid after using many times.
B00KTHYEAQ|5|saved a lot of money over new works 100%
B00FVD3N5A|1|This product is not what you see above.  Look at the picture I provided.  What I got in the email is totally different from the one above. I really wanted that exact product above but all I got is a piece of plastic.  I am not happy with this.
B00K9BEXTE|5|This was a great decal to add to our truck (just above the Equality sticker) before our trip through the heartland of America.
B008CGMNXG|5|Great
B00EEEB77I|4|It's does take away those big wet stops on cars, but it will always leave small ones.  Not good on glass at all.  It's not the best, but its better than a regular towel.
B001KQLGVK|5|On-time and perfect fit.
B004J9LC4Q|4|like it.
B00IAHIAYS|5|Good working part!
B000NNKN8S|5|This is a great fit for my bike. It is easy to put on and keeps my bike out of the sun.
B006RUJ2D8|3|Slightly better than goo gone
B0034ZO8CY|5|Love it! Fits great and GREAT Customer Service!
B002ISTNZU|1|IT only lasted a few months after replacing it twice.  Then it was out of warranty so it was a complete waste of money.
B00598LYWQ|4|I am writing about the size of this product. We all know the name Bondo and the good quality it is. When it says small it is small. But this is what i was looking for. I uploaded some pictures to show the size and what comes in the package. The pic with the bic lighter is to show the size of the products.
B00546QB5S|2|I got my item right away which is a plus.... The only bad thing is that it does not fit my car... I don't know if it's too short because it does not reach both sides.
B00CMUCHHK|5|Fuel filter and priming pump as stated great value for 2005 Duramax.  Had developed an air leak at base of the original priming pump causing engine to stall after pulling a load in hot weather.
B00TD9ZE3M|5|Purchased these to accessorize my MacBook and it is great. The product was easy to apply and included user friendly instructions to assist in installation. The design is great and shipping was fast and the item arrived in perfect condition I will definitely be buying more of these for my other devices
B004VY6M3A|5|Very stylish; my wife loves it for her brand new SUV. It is made well.
B0009XQUKC|5|Good!
B00GWFKUE8|5|Best mats I have ever owned! Fits my 2015 Tundra perfectly and cleans easily. Looks great
B00A8MZ7IA|5|I bought these during Amazon's prime day for a slight discount cause I'm always looking for good microfiber towels and had previously heard good things about chemical guys products. I'm so glad I decided to get these and I'm about to order more of these same towels and a few of the waffle weave towels, along with some various chemicals (car wash, detailer, etc) since I like them more than a few of my more expensive towels. They have a short nap on one side that I found to be exceptional at removing my klasse twins and the carnuaba I filled them with and the other side is longer and well suited for buffing, quick detailing, and waterless car wash. I can't say it enough, I love these towels.
B00029CYRG|5|Works GREAT! made my boat look new again!
B008GVBM70|1|Not the  best wiring  circuit board was lose in the housing  would work then not
B0050HGZC0|5|A marvelous holder for the handicap tag. Here in Georgia the tags are printed on cardboard and a protective hanging case is essential if the tag is to last.
B00O83RW6K|4|Arrived on time. Looks good on the car. Wiring harness is about 8 feet too long (better than being short but... Finding a suitable place to grab a +12VDC from was the trickiest part.
B001EIZ5CA|5|Good price
B005GHB5U6|5|i lke it
B00MTHLPKG|5|Bought this for my cousin. She loved it! Good quality.
B003L35EWM|5|I purchased this from autozone because I wanted to try something different. I love the other lucas products and have bought the typical other brands before ( mothers  etc). But this interior cleaner is hands down the best I've used and has a great smell. Smells like apple cinnamon. Lucas, you just earned yourself another customer for your great products.
B0079MU8N6|2|received battery fast and in good condition,after filling battery and installing battery it worked great for a week. battery went dead. I charged it back up,tested electrical system for power draw and no problem found. I left battery disconnected for a couple of days and retested battery and it was down to 12.3 volts,thats about 10 percent of a charge.bad battery. will have to see about a warranty process
B003D4GWSO|5|A handy addition to our new travel trailer in the bathroom! It includes a soap dish, toothbrush holder and the handy little holder for extras! The suction cups seem to be very good. There's a red line that shows up when the suction cups are going to release.
B008CSF7IM|5|great
B00F7S85WK|1|Does not have two lower screw holes, so I can not use it. Just wasted the money.
B003ULZGFU|5|Jack of all trades.
B007N926J4|5|It fit perfect
B000I04Z7Q|4|They work very well. I installed them under my seats facing forward and back. The glow is brighter than expected and lights up more of my floor. They really make the entire floor glow if you position the light bars right. The issue I had was the installation instructions. I felt they were a bit vague. It does come with an in line fuse on the power wire which makes it easy to use. I hooked mine up through the dimmer switch for the dash lights. The hardest part was finding a good location under the seats to mount to and giving enough slack for the seats to still be adjustable. Also I don't have much luck getting them to flash to the music. Or getting them to stay on a certain color. Which is not that big of a deal for me, because I just enjoy the lights. They took me about 2 hours to install from start to finish. Figuring out what to connect the wires to and mounting the lights and hiding all the leads.
B000CQOIT6|5|Good quality.
B000C57V0K|5|Way beefier than the stock center link bar on my 2001 Grand Cherokee. The stock one weighed 4.8lbs and this one weighed 9.9lbs. Should hold up to rock impacts much better.
B007PJ5GKS|5|Great window decal met my expectation would recommend seller
B008RDFXFO|5|The luggage rack arrived early and quick. EASY to install and works great!
B001R9UTJ0|5|Works great! Cool weather riding or you can roll it into a bandanna. I ordered extras and the lined one for the fall.
B0022ZK3D0|5|Very good
B00JYMZ8HK|5|I used this on a 3 week camping trip in many campgrounds. Worked great and provided peace of mind.
B003ZLS4E0|5|perfect fit
B000EEX6IA|5|great
B000GV65T8|1|I purchased this bumper after checking to see if it would fit my four wheeler.<br />The drop down icon showed that this would fit my machine.<br />I got it in and it was not even close!<br />When I called to ask if it was missing a bracket or something to get it to fit I was told that it is a custom fit item.<br />They offered to let me exchange it for a bumper that would fit for close to the same price.<br />When I looked on their website the only bumper that would fit was $200.00 more than this item.<br />They need to be more clear that this is a generic bumper and you will need to make your own brackets to fit your machine.
B00I8R2APK|4|I would like if someone could contact me on this. Ordered 2 - different styles n neither one fit the console I have in 2015 60/40 seats combination. Truck I have has a console where bottom seat also has a lockable storage compartment. Both previous ordered seat covers didn't have where I could open bottom storage compartment. If Fia makes one I still want to order one. Please let me know if they do. Contact me by email r 7013201103.<br /><br />Thanks Brian
B00JJ66XCA|4|Great product, but when using normal 4 sided lugnnut wrench they scratched extremely easily. When using a automatic they don't scratch nearly as bad. Overall 4/5 still look great!
B00192QB9M|4|Grips the wire well and was easy to assemble. Screws are a light weight metal and one them twisted off easily. Other than that  good product.
B000COVG8E|5|Delivery time great. Fit perfectly
B00CFSZKIC|5|Worked great form my van. Came very quickly.
B000FW2MWW|5|great product and service
B0066PUT36|4|Good article.
B0067DZTXW|5|Smells so good! I had to get a huge pack of them!
B00XZ9PGY8|5|its still working great and I have had it a few months its saved my keys from breaking.
B00ZGI7RPC|4|The black shading inside the lense doesn't match the factory shading. Otherwise, a good product.
B0062QTZBQ|4|great helmet for the money.
B003TP3FCS|5|Just what I needed!
B0077YWSAW|1|It's made from cheap plastic. It keeps popping out of place. Way too flexible to stay hooked into position.
B0047DIOAO|5|Fit my '01 V70 fine, and seems to make for q quiet suspension up front.
B0041MGDLI|5|Works great.
B0060I4O6C|5|Great for water heaters
B008A2FOJC|5|If you have a 13B-MSP these are the plugs you should be using. Came on time, and in good order nuff said.
B005LJOXB2|5|Haven't put it on but it's the right part for my 99 civic
B001FAIA0Q|5|Works great.  A little tricky to install but the tool provided worked great.
B00EHIOSPO|5|Great product! Works as described.  Amazing customer service.  They went above and beyond to help me out with an ordering mistake.  Will definitely purchase another set for my other car.
B001JT98S6|1|This thing caught on fire when I used it  :(
B000AMBHG4|4|Easy to hook up
B002LWOD4O|3|Fits as described, once I got a complete set.  It took 3 attempts of them shipping the item too me before I received a full complete set of gaskets.
B004BG1FIK|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B003YMTMI2|5|Perfect fit.  Lots of power.
B00JPR3XOO|5|Working great for now, knock on wood a bit of a hard fit with gasket. Had to use sand paper to smooth out Water pump housing area rust and stuff. Remember rubber o ring is the only seal so handle with care, lubricate it a little if you have to. Would buy again
B000930N0U|5|This immediately stop;ed the fluid leak in the power steering system in the 1994 Ford Ranger.
B000IZ9S14|4|Was missing one bolt and there was now packing material to keep it from moving at all
B003RGIWO0|5|Stopped the head gasket leak of the 1994 Ford Ranger and no troubles ever since.
B00ZAEQID4|5|Worked out perfect... look real nice!
B00VO7TF4A|5|Very easy installation and gives my 2015 Colorado a very  cool look. Great fit and nice quality.
B009XHSP6M|5|Great quality!
B00GD4UC3M|5|I have bought several supports from Wisconsin auto supply in the past and they have always fit perfectly and are priced at a great value.
B00F4HZW98|5|Nice color's , they match my steering wheel cover I bought from Amazon.
B001FKG1ZM|5|Easy to install, worked like it should.
B000CF5ZF8|4|Excellent quality. Shipped in a box that was way too big.
B00BTSHK0U|3|Sound quality is sucky.  They are too high pitched.  The worst part is they will not play music from my LG L86 Smartphone.  I switched to a Samsung S4 smartphone and it works flawlessly.  Sound quality is still to be desired.
B00327DYYM|5|They fit perfectly. We had a hole on the drivers side of the old ones and I had spilled a bottle of Dr. Pepper on the passenger side so we decided to try these. The color is a little darker than our original ones (grey), but they still look great.
B003JSO1X2|5|Great
B00DI3DV6G|5|Works great
B00BCRMBSO|5|I have a family of five and drive a Toyota RAV 4 with a third row.  My kids are constantly rubbing their dirty hands on the seats- which now looked stained and grubby.  I decided to try the Solid tan seat covers.  The front seat covers fit like a glove and slip on.  They come with head rest covers and seat belt covers.  I also received a steering wheel cover.  I could not get the covers to fit on my third row (which is not a full size back seat) so I put the cover on the middle row,  it fit fine there. It was difficult for me to install the covers with the S hooks as I was not sure where to hook everything to and the instructions were not user friendly for a non DIY person like myself. My husband was able to figure it out with some trial and error.  Overall a great seat cover set to protect your car from spills, stains and dirty hands.<br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B0076AU20U|5|Works, fits and looks like a Toyota part, except for the price. Great find!
B00VSG86EM|5|LOVE THE SMELL THANK YOU !!
B009X5O7ZW|4|Hard to find, but this was exactly what I needed.
B0076I5162|1|It needs a fit kit.  My Ford Expedition is not set up to have this filter although it &#34;fits&#34; my vehicle per Amazon.  I should have returned it but didn't bother so not sure about the return process.

B006QH552E|5|The brand speaks for itself, it arrived early, fully charged and is working flawlessly.<br />Just make sure you keep these out of the cold once temps start to get below 50 degrees bc it'' kill the battery.  pther than that these things last a long time and are a must for the track.

B004YK4S1O|5|A nice touch to my wheels :)
B00DZI47Q2|1|The graphics are awesome...if you want to hang it on a wall.  I used the helmet, left it in my toy hauler for a couple of months...when I went to use it again, the padding had fallen out.  They used a cheap glue.  I guess that you get what you pay for.  I will not be buying O'Neal riding gear based on this helmet.
B000VLF990|5|I was pleasantly pleased to my order delivered in such a timely manner. The kit had instructions that were easily read and it took hardly any time to place on my Jeep. The materials were first rate and looked of an enduring quality.
B000L9AD2K|5|Works good for the price

B00EC7F8MC|4|Works as advertised.
B00RBMN5CA|5|Works perfectly, mounted this inside the housing on my Honda EU3000is generator on the lower edge of the fuel tank.
B00EB3Y062|5|This looks great on my 2008 FZ6.  Its been on all Summer and no signs of failure yet.  Sticky as glue and adds a nice accent to the bike
B006LIZ3D4|4|Not much to complain about. Fast shipping. One bulb wasn't working but the fixed it right away.
B00HRXQQ7Y|5|The wheel locks work well for my 2004 Passat. I had my old wheel locks removed when I couldn't find the key. The right size, coming in a small package as seen above. I'm happy with the purchase.
B00P0LCN36|5|I must say, Proforged tie rods are better than OE, at least on my Acura TL.  Impressive quality and finish.  I highly recommend them!
B00HVHN9RG|5|The KEYGUARDZ ,it is an excellent product that ensures security controls of cars.Thanks
B003UZUTIU|4|As stated on other review, the windshield is clear, not tinted.  I wanted clear so I am glad that was pointed out.  My windshield install without modification on 2006 Polaris Ranger XP.  Although, I did have put extra washers on one side of the upper windshield to shim it to get it to fit.  Some of the plastic protective shipping cover material was torn and left streaks of sticky on the windshield when removed from package.  Using alcohol as stated in the information sheet did not work.  Finally decided to use Goo-Gone, was concerned it would mess up the surface of the windshield, but it worked fine.  Instructions stated not to over-tighten the screw or the windshield might crack.  On my first long ride, half the screws and washers vibrated out.  Hopefully, I can get some more from Kolpin because they are special design washers.  Make sure you use lock tite on the screws or they are subject to be lost.  Windshield does well at protecting from the elements and the pivot ability helps on hot days as long as you are traveling at a high speed.  Overall I am satisfied with the windshield, just wish the instructions had stated to lock-tite the screws in and that the adjusting hardware to tilt the windshield had a locking element.
B00PC0G07A|5|Fairly easy to install, comes with enough thread and needle, fits well on the prius steering wheel and around the spokes. Good feel, great price.
B00MAZG66A|4|A fine product that matches the seller's description.  The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was that one of the spacers had a small flaw that i assume was caused by the drill hitting on accident .
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Great product for the money very durable
B0050EEOK8|5|Very sturdy adjusts to uneven surfaces pricy but worth every penny
B001F72Y5G|2|Good price, but not very sturdy. I crushed one last time when our travel trailer (5000lb) was parked a little bit uphill. Do not use it if you really want to secure something!
B00FQ0ROZS|1|It said it came with 4 I only received 2!
B000GUYSQG|5|Very good shipping, arrived as advertised
B006NM788Q|5|Part delivered fast and is fantastic.  Simple to install and works perfectly.
B00OXP5YYU|5|Works great and was easy to install. Really liked the mounting brackets!
B009XIOUJW|1|Not what I expected
B00KRQY81O|4|They look just like the picture but I thought they were going to be bigger.  I should have read the description closer.
B002E363SY|5|Worked as claimed. Perfect fit. Shipping speed and protection were superb.
B00M8KHQW0|5|Really cute, love them
B00B96AKF4|4|fine
B008VIBW64|5|The handles are good the installation of the handles sucks.
B006VFEJJQ|5|You can do the battery replacement yourself.  I think the only reason it's expensive to have a dealer do it is there are several brackets and parts to remove before you can get to the battery.  There are some short YouTube videos that show you what's coming.<br /><br />Smokes, that's a lot of money for a small car battery, but the Amazon price beats auto parts stores by $50 - $75.  It would be even worse to pay more for a dealer to replace.<br /><br />SUGGESTION for those who don't normally do this sort of thing: As you take out parts and screws, lay them on a cloth in a pattern that resembles placement in the car and that will remind you of the order that they came out, when it's time to put it all back together.<br /><br />DISPOSAL:  I took the old Toyota Prius battery to the city recycling center.<br /><br />THE ORIGINAL BATTERY:  The battery in our 2008 Toyota Prius lasted until this year - 7 years.  Pretty good.  I think running it down completely 4 or 5 times a few years ago is what eventually killed it.  The dome light was left on a few times.<br /><br />EXTRA INFO: I am surprised and delighted that a heavy car battery can be shipped.  Just goes to prove, we can get just about anything from Amazon.
B0066IU9B0|5|Great Product,Quick Shipper. A+++++
B000234ITE|5|very heavy duty.  nice jack.  im using 3 of them to install a new support beam under my house.
B00AHJN04C|5|I installed these on my corolla 2 years ago, and have been very satisfied.  This car is my daily driver (09 corolla) and I put on about 90 miles per day with lots of steep hills and aggressive breaking.  Certainly a great deal, especially since a pair of oem rotors will set you back $150.  The oems that came with my car started pulsing after about 3 years.. these are very competitive.  Also, they repel the rust-- I hate rusty rotors, and these look decent after a lot of wear.
B00IEJSU74|5|Worked as expected and good price
B000C57M40|5|Is a very good product. I recommend to everyone.
B001OZJNUS|5|ok

B000182F22|5|Excellent quality manual hub! Much better value than OEM product for the price!
B009X1WO2O|5|Fast delivery. No problems.
B0002MBKUU|5|It fits great on my rav4. Just be careful how to mount them on your spare tire, especially if the spare is contacting the cargo door/tailgate area. YOU CAN TEAR IT APART IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL!.<br /><br />You would prefer to loosen the cord as much as possible AND the spare tire mounting lugs off the spare tire carrier. Apply the cover on the spare, then orient Taz's position to your preference. YOU MUST REMOVE THE COVER HALFWAY (or more?) to reveal the mounting lugs on the spare tire carrier to tighten the lugs partially. DO NOT tighten the lug that places the contacting point of your spare tire to the door/tailgate. TWISTING TO RE-POSITION THE COVER CAN TEAR IT if the lug(s) are tighten all the way!..<br /><br />Although it is not a parachute where your life will not depend on the quality and craftmanship of this item, install it with care and you will be satisfied with it.
B000BPZ306|5|Just great!  Will tell friend to buy.
B003BZINKU|5|Perfect Replacement.
B00P73KWE4|5|Required some modifications to mount to my machine, but once on it is very solid. I used it for the first time today and it holds a lot of stuff. As someone else suggested, I put wing nuts on the bolts holding the basket on for easy removal. I'll take the basket off tomorrow in order to use my sprayer, then put it back on with ease. I also bolted down a piece of plywood in the basket for extra strength. I'm very happy with purchase so far. Rack is well built and a great price for the product received.
B00C9DY78W|5|Fast shipping and great product.
B00UCXFO6A|5|Quality voltage regulator for a great price. Great shipping time as well.
B000CKHGAA|4|Fit like a glove....love it it works just lke expected.  Good choice.
B002UJVNFA|4|It's great because I wear contacts and I need the protection against wind.
B00RJJ240O|5|Use it on the back of my fishing boat and it's perfect!
B00KWGSKA4|4|Fits nice and flush, and looks great.  I just wish it had a bit of overhand on the edges to grip it for removal.  The only way to remove it is with a screwdriver to pry on the edge.
B007PZC6GO|5|great workmanship and great savings
B003BJPWZK|5|Works good
B0016J5VIU|5|Worked awesome. No more leak.
B0009PCPNQ|5|One of the best to clean the interior of your car...
B00HA1NO14|5|I really like this window shade that I bought for my 2015 Honda Accord.  It is well made, doesn't seem cheap, fits my windshield perfectly, folds up accordion style, and comes with a case to store it.
B001657AMO|5|As described great.

B000765DHC|5|works very well
B00S1EQJ9S|5|Item came promptly & item works very well. Will buy in the future.
B000COS61E|1|Don't waste your money. Just like the other reviews the plug breaks off in the fuel bowl then you have a fuel leak and have to remove the fuel bowl to remove the broken piece.
B00OFKHX8I|1|cheap plastic that broke went trying to get over the stems.  Had to throw away.  Don't waste your money.  JUNK
B00LV8P9BU|5|Size like it was ordered and good leather and strong zippers
B000KYYMKK|5|took three to dealer and $40 later walked out with all lworking perfect.  Saved Sooooo much money over being from parts department that wanted over $100 each.
B002R38TCE|1|This was supposed to help with cleaning the convertible top but all it did was shed hairs all over.  I would not recommend it.
B0085SO9E2|5|Perfect fit.
B007JMTQTS|4|Have not used the strap yet, but looks like it is well made.  Bought the 10 ft. length to use on large trees.

B00KMYYQ36|5|Really cool
B00FRHOGU6|4|I bought them a while back after reading some good reviews.It's only rained once when I was in my truck and they did a good job.<br />Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is I will wait until they get more use to see how they hold up.
B003FBV8ZW|5|Real quality eyewear.....thanks
B0018YEM1K|5|Fast delivery, perform great
B001DRNNEO|3|doesnt fit, description was wrong. It does fit the intake air, but not the cab intake air as it had stated.

B000CJ3UZ6|4|Good product...just exactly what they ssid it would be.....no disappointment.
B000AM8B1I|5|I've used this stuff over thirty years on motorcycle seats. All the protection and good looks without making the seat slippery.

B00NX1VLGA|5|best deep shine ever seen-  it's a tad messy, but worth it
B000F5ED12|5|Great product.  Shipped very fast.
B00OZVPKJQ|1|Installed without problem but broke by the third turn of the crank to hoist the tire.  Cheaply made case split across the top.  Very poor quality and the company will not pay to return their defective product.  Avoid this poor seller and poor quality product.  I have been on Amazon a long time and make many purchases without a problem.  This has been the poorest quality product and worst customer service ever on Amazon. Huge disappointment and wasted effort to install their cheaply made product.
B00BITIQVW|5|fits perfect
B004J10QIW|5|great price
B00KCE96O0|5|love the color, worked out really well...
B001O9Z2XG|5|Great Looking and at a good price
B00W5X75BC|3|Pretty small.  Imagined bigger.
B00VAVSNBG|4|Works well.<br />But had a hard time fitting it into the truck.  The length was about 1 inch too long.  I had to pry the lower connection into place with a crowbar between the top of the control arm and the top of the strut placement.
B00VYX2I7A|1|Very chinsy that's what I get for trying to save a buck. Mesh is plastic looks like a grille to a kids battery operated jeep.
B003YMRNV0|5|Works/fits as expected
B000V2N5O0|5|Worked great
B004YNOT0Q|5|Very cool.
B00SCQO7J4|5|works very well,

B00DW6RYQW|3|fell apart long before i think it should have
B00DRGRQYM|5|Super happy with product
B002FVQ0WY|3|didn't stop water!
B00D9C2CDO|5|Great value! Needed some extra space in our van (2013 Chrysler Town & Country) for a recent family vacation. One way was about 350 miles form home. Our van has cross bars on the factory roof rack. On the way there, I attached the front and rear straps to the cross bars as recommended in the instructions, which worked fine. On the way back, I decided to use the tie-down points on both sides of the rack (see attached photos). Both ways were very secure, I may experiment with getting hooks for the tie-down points - the downside to using them is that the connectors don't fit through, so I had to un-thread them, feed the straps through the tie-down points, and then re-thread them. Kind of a pain but I thought it worked a little better. I had 2 normal-sized suitcases, 1 smaller, soft-side suitcase, 5 bike helmets, and a couple of blankets and towels inside the cargo bag. I put a couple of beach towels on the bottom of the bag, just for a little bit of padding between the suitcase and the roof. On the way back we were rained on for the whole day - including some heavy rain and very windy. I was pleased when we unloaded and I found the inside completely dry. Very happy with this cargo bag.
B0009IK9DG|4|It took several days to arrive, not the 2 days as promised, but it works well and has soft bristles on the head which I like for car washing.
B00L1EKGBM|4|Worked fine except for the metric bolt that needs a hex key to tighten. I plan to replace it with a normal top bolt.
B006BE0ZBS|5|Just as described.
B00I1KMMMA|5|Perfect fit for my Chinese scooter
B0002JMU20|1|Won't  work not for a jeep liberty
B00CD2RCGI|5|AWESOME!<br />Item is exactly as described, shipped quickly, installed easily, my only suggestion for the manufacturer would be that they might want to include extra information showing which direction the rubber seal should face when putting it on the fender flares, as well as including at least a few retainer clips similar to what the factory uses to secure the wheel well shrouds. If your installing these, its likely because you do not have any, and believe it or not, the factory short cuts during production of a vehicle often include a few retainer clips and fasteners  for the wheel well shrouds, so installing these might mean you may have t go out and buy clips and crews that were left out during as a shortcut when building the vehicle...happens more than most people know.
B00O52ERA8|5|I recieved this product in a timely manner and it was exactly as described! It fits my car well!
B00JL7ZSZK|5|Looks great. Easy installation.
B000EDUUGM|5|Covers the sink to give me more countertop space.  Easy to clean too.
B00LEVFDYC|5|Just as advertised
B00HJWT0YY|4|I looked for a way to warn others' about my wheelchair vans ramp.  I wish they made these larger.  If it was larger I would have given 5 stars.  It should be at least a foot or more tall, but against my white van it does stand out and I bought two so I could put one on the back end as well.
B00TJ22BQ6|5|Great!
B00B0Q45OU|1|Even though I put in the year, make, and model this part was not correct and I had to send it back.
B000CN947U|5|Direct fit for the factory replacement
B006QNN46W|5|I have installed these on 2 bikes now. I have also installed the LA Choppers brand on 1 bike.  I prefer these over LA Choppers!!! LA choppers were a little thicker metal but these are less than half the price, easier to install, and can drop 1 or 2 inches where LA Choppers is just 1 inch.  The other problem with the LA Choppers brand is they can cause rubbing.  On the 2 bikes I have installed these on I have has zero complaints of rubbing or bottoming out.  THESE ARE GREAT!!!!
B0066QU9HG|5|Fits like a glove, after seeing a message to check brake LT circuit and noticing that my brake lights didn't I ordered this and now they do.
B008X03FVA|5|Great price , quality part
B008PPDK4A|5|this proved to be afar cheaper repair than going to a dealership, I was fairly easy to swap out the tumblers in the old lock set, just don't lose any of the springs :)
B00KTIWD44|5|Good
B008AKN81K|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B000E8T81U|5|i love purlator filters. textured exterior. easy to see under the car. right pressure settings for my STI. and the absolute best filtration that you will get from an oil filter.
B000CHMNLU|5|Works great, shipped fast
B003K2IL24|1|Nice pads, but Amazon listed these and the rear pads as fitting my 2005 Subaru Lecacy GT, which they did not!
B00JEUHSXY|5|I love this mats. The best I have ever have bought. Fit exactly in where they are supposed to, and even fit into the original manufacturers eyelets to hold the mats in place.
B00UB71N0I|3|I ordered this item but decided to return it because the material itself is not as sturdy as I had hoped. There was an extra little piece from manufacture that was loose in the package and I was able to tear that little piece in two using my fingers. I'm sure the product protects from the sun but I had too many doubts as to its longevity to keep the cover. This isn't readily apparent from the pictures.<br /><br />If you need a cover where there is little wind or for short-term use, perhaps this is a good option.
B00DJ7ON2W|5|The length of the is great.
B0055AZECY|1|Very disappointed with these rotors and ACDelco. Installed one rotor and had the other side disassembled, to find a hole in the back of the rotor upon opening the packaging. How does something so obvious slip through ACDelco's quality control?<br /><br />I emailed ACDelco and was told I needed a part number and my VIN, and then to call their 1-800 number. When I called, they didn't ask for any part numbers or VIN, they simply told me that I needed to deal with this through Amazon. What a waste of time.<br /><br />Terrible product, terrible customer service. I will never purchase any ACDelco products again, and I'd advise you do the same. Spend the extra money and get a quality product.
B003UM5M12|1|leaked on first try.
B00NGW0EVO|3|Nice but you have to make the hole bigger than the rim for the led.
B00KB4ZNQQ|5|I got then 4 days later always fast shipping but it doesn't come with instructions so lets see if I dont mess up ha thank u
B00CE3OQPG|5|Cured my Mazda5 knocking sounds. Lots (more than 3) of mechanics could not diagnose worn out sway bar bushings.
B006P88O4A|5|awesome patch

B00KISU784|5|Great deal!! Perfect color and fit for my camper!  Speedy delivery! ! Thx for a terrific deal!!
B000EDOT8C|5|stayed put except on the rockiest roads, heavy and good quality
B000COAY6O|1|received 3 separate sets of headers, all damaged in exact same way.<br />no way to contact hooker, HUGE GASH in #1 cylinder tube! don't buy until manufacturer fixes whatever is wrong!!!!!<br />again. DO NOT BUY
B00GJMQESU|5|I like it a lot... Very visible.  Fit and cut are designed to be tight.  Your normal size should be fine, but just understand the cut is tight, and it is supposed to be that way.<br /><br />Lots of pockets, and a zip out rubber like rain protector.  Zip out also works very nicely for when the temp drops, keeps the jacket warm. Protection pads feel good.  Hope I never need to see how they hold up when someone goes down. Mesh is very comfortable when riding, even on the hottest days.  Gets a bit hot when slow in traffic, but that is not just this jacket, that is ANY jacket. Sometimes you need to give up a bit of comfort for a bit of protection.
B007VYHK10|5|From the initial feel AND heft of this gastket, I can rest assured that they're built to last.<br />Really nice packaging, too: A sturdy cardboard box, instead of the usual clear, crumbly plastic bag of lesser brands.<br /><br />Time will tell, but even cheap knockoffs can last a couple years of heavy turbo boosting, so I wouldn't wait for the update review any time soon.
B000MOGX3M|5|Looks great and strong very good product to buy..
B003L2XP88|5|Excellent quality and decent price. Check the inside for debris as I found some in mine.
B009S00IWS|5|the back rest fit perfectly and was quality made I am very pleased with this item
B0007LVJ2A|5|Works well. Keep cover on and you'll have no problems
B004J0V3WG|5|First off, a big Thanks to Prime Choice Auto Parts. For the fast shipping and safe packaging. Next you cannot beat the price. These guys were right as $100 cheaper than the lowest price I could find on this radiator around my area, as well as across the internet. After receiving and inspecting the radiator, I found  no issues with it, and all hardware points, rubber mounting points as well as hose and line connection points were all as they were supposed to be. I had no issues with the installation, and so far after about 150 miles I see no issues with the radiator. Cooling good. I will post an update after 6 months with a reassessment in the event any thing changes. But for the time being, I am very satisfied with this purchase and with Prime Choice Auto Parts.
B0036IA6JI|3|it's good.
B000CGFVOW|5|Ordered this pump for my 1997 Chevy Blazer and installed it to fix my very erratic and sometimes not working at all gas gauge, had to drop the gas tank to install it, fit perfectly. Comes with a wiring upgrade kit, followed the instructions had no problems.
B00332GOIO|2|I couldn't wind the window up the whole way during the initial test fit, and the passenger side guard broke while I was slowly cranking up the window. I ended up with the exterior mount wind guards.
B00E3UM8A8|5|Nice goggles.
B001P2GBTQ|2|I returned this product!
B004ZF39T0|5|had them for about a month or two now and no issues! so far so good!
B00IS6Y3H4|5|Better quality than expected, buy with confidence would recommend to my best friend
B00J633AAE|5|I bought the Nerf Bars for my Toyota RAV4, 2014 model. Very easy to install, it took me less than an hour to install both bars (2). The holes underneath match perfectly to the bars. All hardware is included, good quality stainless steel comes with the bars. I think they look nicer than Toyota's original factory equipment.
B0088ZR3L8|1|Paint was not good quality.  Will not buy from again and would not recommend.
B0087NAZM0|5|Works great...I'm not very technical so still have to figure out how to listen to music from my cell phone, but otherwise works great!
B0010GGFHK|5|Perfect
B00KE8LSPE|5|I bought these for my 2015 civic si (coupe) and the front set fit perfectly. The back set fit almost as well but for the price it is definitely worth getting this set.
B00FWOKKGI|5|This is amazing how bright it is for the price. I'm impressed it's as bright as my buddies bar for over half the price. A breeze to install as well. There's the before and after pictures.
B000F2JGLM|5|fit.  color.  quality.  perfect
B007ZGBLNW|5|Great little light
B00KV8U254|5|Good
B005E5T6IS|5|MotorKing #1 seller !
B00OVV17X8|5|Good product, received quickly!
B0012PQBVE|3|This was not the right part for the application.  This part is for a Chev/GMC without rear A/C.  I was able to get it to work by bending the<br />pipes around for the low side hose going to the compressor.  Other wise the delivery was fast and the part looks good.<br /><br />Steve NV7V<br />ASE Master L1 A9<br />Precision Auto Experts<br />Orem, Utah
B000CITK8S|4|good product
B00PHTXWQS|5|Used in my 2007 F-150.  All I can say is WOW!  Attention-getting brightness.
B0025ZFD5U|5|The best assortment for a car dealership. Has good coverage . I sell a good amount of cars, when I do , I just bring this assortment to the car with some tools and the license plates are on the car.
B000C8ZFJG|5|Exact replacement fit. Should come with a gasket for the price but didn't. No biggie. Parts stores all had the gasket for less than $5. Other than that, a high quality replacement part. Great stainless and good welds. Wouldn't expect anything less from a brand like Walker.
B007Q8ET6K|5|have these for two of my vehicles and bought a set for my sister in law, The protect the cars here in snowy, sloppy Michigan
B00JIHC36K|1|UPDATE ... These were good while they worked, which is about 6 months. Both bulbs failed for different reasons within 1 month of each other. The first bulb actually had one of the electrical legs fall off. After much arguing back and fourth with the manufacturer they reluctantly agreed to replace it. This morning the second bulb failed. It was flashing on and off much like the lights on a tow truck. I am going to look elsewhere
B00K0TA7WW|5|Made a big difference. Great GDI maintenance. I have a 2011 Hyundai Sonata with 75k miles.
B0018JXLSK|5|On time and as described
B00W2YSN1K|5|There give my vehicles so much character now I love them thank you
B00PE0JPFW|3|Works.
B00FFUEGTG|5|Works excellent, however these are not the clips that get broken, they were the other kind. But, keep in mind your car Could be different then mine. I have the 2007 E550 with the Sport option
B00JAKN922|5|Quality product
B00029K022|5|A+++++
B0055EALW8|5|Good quality
B003RQBKLC|5|Came in handy for our road/camping trips
B002P3KJLU|4|Perfect for watering my terrace. Seems a bit delicate, but I think that comes with the territory of the lower end water hoses. No problems here.
B00YG3KMBY|5|Great piece to add a look to the engine. Not much to say just that it made all the other rusty parts stand out. So I bought an engine dress up kitt.NOW it looks nice.
B001GJ3FIS|5|Perfect for use on my tiny terrace, good for cleaning off dirt, great for watering plants.
B00UBNH2W0|5|What can I say about the Evo21 Dual Action Polisher.  Its a unicorn in the detailing business.  It is your first and last polisher you will ever need.  I recently purchased this and bought all the specified cutting compounds off the Gloss-It website as well.  My car went from being insanely covered with orange peel from the factory to becoming a completely new car.  I absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a  to do it yourself project and learn how to properly paint correct and polish your car.  Gloss-It has some very good tutorial videos of which I watched and re-watched again before I set out to give it a go.  I rate this product a 10/10  Thank you Amazon for this amazing deal.  -CB
B00650NY6G|5|I did all four doors on my '15 Nissan Frontier, using two packages.  I followed the instructions to the letter, took my time to make sure it followed each door's curves exactly. I stretched it as little as possible, just enough to bend it along the curves, so that it won't pull back and loosen over time.  Despite some pretty sharp bends in the doors, the tape went on beautifully, and looks as perfect and professional and the factory-installed tape on the Honda Odyssey sitting next to it in our garage.
B00SXA2CMI|3|Very easy installation, but don't expect for it to stay on with just the 3M.  You'll need to screw it into the bottom of the bumper for a more flush and clean look.
B000NCOKV0|5|Great
B00P2D3VZG|5|The color is Perfect, and the brightness is sharp. I've always liked Philips work, so i'm pretty positive they'll last as long as they say. If you're looking for LED's for your interior, i definitely recommend these.
B00PRXPYRO|2|The glue doesn't hold the stick to the car. I tried several times but the instead of removing the dent the glue would come out of the car.
B003YJLAIK|5|Works as intended and provides us with consistent water pressure. Those of us who are veteran RVers know that water pressures vary from location to location and the preset regulators don't always provide the pressures we desire. So, an adjustable one does wonders!
B00FKHKQ0W|5|Great product! Be sure to use the new bolts that are provided
B0049O4SYC|5|Great stock fit and no more squeaky breaks
B002M9LBIC|5|Yeah it's very shine for my tires. I love it.
B00FMITO2K|2|Eh, color of light bar is kind of bluish. Isn't really that bright at all.. Good thing I only bought it for show. I wouldn't buy it again. The light bar shipped fast as hell though. A+ shipping. D- product. Don't buy
B00GJLLBZ2|5|Works great.  Used in our retro camper when remote camping with no electricity.
B0002KO3YW|1|Great product
B000XSGL48|5|I'm a believer.  Wound up having a injury that left my bike site with it's tubular's for over a year.  Started commuting about 36 miles a day 3 days week.  On my ride home I got flat on the sidewall as it I guess started to crack.  3 different small leaks on the right side of the front tire.  Added a half bottle of Stan's. Pumped up, the tire spewed out the white stans, which then congealed and I made it home.
B007TYB6DA|5|Came to me fast ! Bought for a 2002 Trailblazer, fit perfectly, and was easy to install.
B00BHKJEIQ|5|very good
B004JPG9X4|5|perfect
B0047ECW4W|5|Great addition.  Looks great.
B009TB53Y4|5|Fits perfectly on the 2012 MDX as described.
B0006SH4HS|5|Properly diluted (1 part per 10 parts of water), it did an Amazing job cleaning my bone-colored leather seats in my Mustang). Caused no damaged and really helped bring back it's original color!
B00GRHSU5C|5|Easy Install. Works as advertised. Still maintains air flow, although it does let in more sun than say, a spiderwebshade. But can't beat the price!
B003N9MQCK|5|Good
B00HYI9AX4|5|Needed something more flexible for both the inside and outside showers on our Travel Trailer. Although the stainless steel was cheaper, the white was a straight replacement for the existing (but stiff!) plastic hoses and looked much better. Connected up perfectly and the hoses are truly flexible and fitted much better, especially in the outside shower. Promptly shipped, we like them a lt.
B00MOMADZY|5|You don't have to be size XXX to appreciate how much easier buckling up is with an extra 3 inches added to your seat belt buckle stalk. Just try to find the buckle wearing your winter overcoat or parka sometime. Friends and family have expressed their approval so much that this will solve my Christmas shopping. When are the auto makers going to wise up?
B008541RKU|5|Really added a renewed style to my already awesome 2010 Camaro.
B000GZZPU4|5|Arrived quicker than expected.  In many situations going from stock exhaust to aftermarket, carb adjustment is needed.  I have not had the exhaust on long enough to decide if a jet kit is needed.  Maybe a better way is to say that I have not driven the quad long enough to decide what's needed.  Overall a nice fitting, good looking exhaust that will stand any test I put it through I'm sure.
B001HATY36|5|Great investment.
B00BMRZN66|4|I ordered this pump to assist with putting gas in my boat.  It came well packaged and works great.  No more gas all over the boat and myself.
B000OV5AX2|5|It works great 💯✔✅
B00EFFY2I2|5|So I read all the reviews and was a little nervous but my garage turned out great.  Love the look.  Here is what I did....<br /><br />First off, I bought this house in foreclosure.  The garage had been sealed before with just a standard concrete sealer, and there were hello kitty stickers, melted electrical tape, and who knows what else on the garage floor.  I read people's complaints and read the instructions.  When you paint with any paint and specifically this one you HAVE to make sure the surface is prepped.  Once you lay paint down there isn't going back (at least without a lot of headaches and buffing.  So I power washed the floor and used a little 5 in 1 scrapper tools to scrap all the misc crap off my floor.  Then I rented a buffer machine from home depot rental, grabbed the most abrasive pad they had and buffed my floor, twice.  Power washed again and I let the floor set a full 24 hours to dry.  Was probably dry sooner but I wasn't taking any chances.<br /><br />Painting time!  I did exactly as the box said.  Mixed the 2 part epoxy for 3 minutes, let it set for 30 min then came back and stirred for another minute.  When its time to start painting I recommend 2 people.  Can be done with one but 2 is easy.  I cut in, let my wife roll (make sure you roll like they tell you in the instructional video, it works!), and then I came behind her and sprinkled flakes.  This worked really well in my opinion, I could cut in faster than she could roll, so it gave me time to sneak behind here and spread the flakes.<br /><br />Couple of quick notes.  I used 3.5 shakers of flakes for a regular 2 car garage.  I went a little heavy but I love the flakes.  I heard some people saying blow them out of your hand, didn't really think that was necessary.  Granted I'm 6'4&#34; but I just reached out and shook them right out of the can, really easy.<br /><br />Coverage:  So many people say coverage was WAY off no way etc.  I actually had extra.  Bought 2 cans for a 2 car garage and it was more than enough.<br /><br />Mismatch colors:  Tons of people said from can to can the colors may not match.  Here is what I did.  There is a clear break in the middle of my garage (for expansion), so in case they didn't match I used one can for one side and one for the other.  That way it would look normal if they didn't match.  Well they matched perfectly and no problems.<br /><br />I let this sit for a full 72 hours before I used the clear top coat.  Wasn't necessary but again I didn't want to do it again.<br /><br />I will continue this review on the clear top coat page.
B000O80AZS|5|Perfect
B000CO7DZ4|4|worked
B00872TYFA|5|nice cap ordered it for my husband..
B008YMTCNC|5|Perfect Kayak transporter
B003ULZGFU|5|Very good
B00C5RB03W|5|fit good and tight and look better than the originals
B007FTV9Q8|5|Love it
B006JXF9DK|2|TOTALLY ADORABLE! Looks great on my car! Radio no longer picks up ANY radio stations though - NOT ONE - ZERO - ZIP - ZILCH! Absolutely useless device unless you are like me and just want a cute antenna. In fact, that's the only reason I gave it 2 stars - for the cuteness factor. This seller is lucky I listen to Pandora a lot. Otherwise I would have returned it with a vengeance.
B0098ISYGC|1|Easy to build - instruction is good.  But you need to put it in flat floor. Since, I brought this for my Ducati monster 696- its fits well. No complain. But why I give one stars - I don't like the material that they use to protect rain - I think it’s cheap and it’s not going to last long. I read some people comments and I think they are right. They need to use better rain protected sheet for this. I brought this for my winter storage and I am going to put solar panel to charge the battery. - Definately Not rain protected. I am not recomend it to any one.
B0006SH4NC|5|best stuff I have ever used!!!!!!!!!!! haven't used hand wax 2yrs. have one truck and 3 bikes
B003TPUKF8|5|works great
B000C842I6|4|Fit exactly and work fine.
B000UTQUAK|4|Installs easy and looks great. However if it was made out of stainless I'm sure it will hold up better to the elements.
B00O4D7OJY|1|Returned them. Mats were not molded correctly and curled up  on the side of the doors, we kept catching our feet on it.
B004GCKY9A|5|All good and as promised.
B003U086XK|5|Was perfect!  I actually ordered it to attach to a granite vase for a cemetery site.  Looks so professional and was very easy to<br />attach.
B00VXNK490|5|satisfied
B006A49J02|5|Best deal and 507.00 compliant with my diesel.
B000CLQHAO|5|Excellent brake pads. Smooth and strong braking. I would definitely purchase them again.
B00AZSPOD0|5|I loved it until i installed it in my Corolla and i blew the engine at 25 pounds of boost!
B00ECXT16A|5|Makes my Toyota look great!!!
B00062ZVWY|5|Great price, Hayden quality, good solution for 69 GTO trans cooler
B004P9ADJU|2|It works well to protect my expensive fridge/freezer. The canvas material is a magnet for pet hair. My cat likes to lay on it, mostly when the fridge is on too. But the hairs stick to this cover and only come off with vigorous brushing. It also doesn't make sense why the reflective coating is on the inside of the cover...would that cause heat to be reflected back to the fridge body?....anyway, I've not noticed any better performance probably due to that engineering puzzle. For scratches and bumps, this is an expensive cover. If you can sew, you can and should make a better one with even better materials....and put the reflective material outside to reduce infrared heat transfer to the fridge body.
B0010DZZPG|5|This sure saves a bunch of money doing this small task of changing the air filter on my Prius.....satisfied with the product
B0010DZZVK|5|Bought this twice already - takes (literally) 6 minutes to install and saves you $60 at the dealer
B00HV0RUVO|5|Love it!!
B008S3POHU|4|Works well. Fits my A4 Avant B7. Thanks!
B00C7S2BIC|5|Great product. Exactly what I needed!
B003SZ3D9Y|5|Very fast delivery. Exactly the right part and fit. Highly recommended and definitely will use them again.
B005LXTOHQ|2|1st time they sent it to me it was defective.  It looked like it was assembled wrong at the factory. I didn't find that out till I had the whole door tore apart.  Had to return it and they sent me a new one. Installed easy and works as expected.
B000TG6LF8|1|It doesn't spray a fine mist that I want.
B00GHT851E|2|The housing arrived cracked. I needed to install the assembly asap, so I made it work with a few modifications. The box in which it came had little padding / protection. I would suggest to better protect sensitive cargo.
B005SB6TJC|5|Good quality - works fine.
B0002JMIEK|5|Good stuff
B005R27ZK4|5|This looks so good in my car, I would recommend this product as the best classic car seat cover I ever purchased.
B0049GHV3U|5|Fast shipping, good radiator
B00B36CIEQ|5|great paint and service
B00LIWSYCK|5|Just what I needed to protect those lower cooling coils and fins from rocks and debris.
B008900BRU|2|They do the trick, but if you have the time and $ go to a shop and have them extend the pipe. They are not as easy an install as I expected.
B00C0SQ8KG|1|THE LIGHT BAR CAME IN CRACKED!
B0055EJMMI|5|Fit great on my valve stems and the color/design has held up doing weather and cleaning.
B00390X6MW|5|Wow
B000EDQQD8|5|Just what I was looking for...!!!
B002R0ALG4|5|Came in as expected. Fit perfectly on my Dads Truck. Ty
B005CLMWYO|5|Good if your replacing the external handle. Still having trouble opening the door? Most likely it's the latch spring, attached to the rod connected to the handle( small spring connected to the rod, most likely broke)Easy fix....get yourself a throttle return spring...connect the spring to the bottom of the rod(near the yellow connector)...then the other side of the spring above the yellow connector.....this will help lift the rod a little, in order for you to open your door via the newly installed door handle.
B00T17PIJ6|5|Actually used these to make a &quot;swing bed&quot; for outside (heavy duty rope is very expensive!  This was much more reasonable and stronger and because it was flat worked better than rope would have.
B00NT7L0Y6|2|Reception is just a little better than having no atenna at all.  I need to buy another better one.
B00I5BAUCE|4|Simple, effective, no brainier for 2 biles
B00ZRUBA0W|5|The are good
B00HKY90EG|5|did not use it because it does not adapt to my aftermarket headlight kit so really there is no rating I will say that it is a quality looking product if things change in would order from them agiain
B002MGYWI6|5|Item spot on has always used this product for years never had a engine problem
B006H34BUY|5|Works great!

B000AP1MRA|4|Fit perfect no diffrencenin performance.
B0033PFZ4U|5|Great product
B00CL53VAS|3|The holes on the barket are too small for the terminals and requires a lot of filing to correct the problem.
B00157TGXY|4|Works as advertised
B0022ZUHM2|5|Exceptional spark for my Harley.
B003BZD03K|5|I looked for a solution for more than ten years and finally found it.  No more bent/flat hoses.
B007LIBQ3O|4|It came with a thread loose, but was otherwise perfect
B00KTHYDA2|4|It works for my 2003 Land Cruiser.<br /><br />Range of this remote is about 30 feet, compared with 80-100 feet of OEM remotes.
B007S1HBII|1|DID NOT FIT AS DESCRIBED!!
B004X245C0|4|Not as big as I had hoped. Smaller than normal bumper stickers but still pretty cool.
B00H4G9Z40|5|As stated
B00KAKEN3A|5|Good
B004C6OBBC|5|Exactly what I expected.  The clip works well.  Doesn't get stuck when trying to put on or take off like so many of these hitch pins.
B000QQWAV0|5|good
B002PL5I9K|5|Perfect fit and new in the package.
B000JIND4S|5|Happy
B003G0KO6G|5|Just what I wanted, delivery exceeded my expectations!
B000FIY08U|5|Works perfectly thanks
B00V3JKY44|2|The key fob does not come with easy instructions and you will have to take the key fob to a locksmith or dealer.
B000C2EH8W|1|1999 Mercury sable dohc.  Installed these to fix code p0171 p0174. Sad to say they made the condition worse. Engine misfired with these on. Took it all apart twice to double check, still the misfire persisted.  Everything was put back properly.  Finally bought oem gaskets from dealer and the engine purred like a happy kitty.  If you're planning to use this for the duratec engine, think again.  These are Chinese crap.
B005DUM9VK|4|Purchase these grips for my husband's V-Rod and they did not fit.  The item description did not specify fits &#34;electric throttle&#34; or &#34;cable throttle.&#34;  This particular set of grips are for an electric throttle which does not fit my husband's cable throttle.  Returning them and searching for the correct grips.
B001VXXUWK|5|Great face shield! It gets used every day.
B00712V1I0|5|Top of the line look and deasent pricing and just plug and play
B00NIDBBBS|5|Love it!!
B005OXVO5S|3|Worked perfectly in my 2007 Impala. It was gard to get to the part behind the glove compartment, but no more tickung noice when i turn on my A/C!!
B0076GTPES|3|The item is working, but I was unable to properly tighten the mounting screws on either side of the motor or the butterfly valve would stop rotating.  I slathered them with loctite blue and hope they stay in place.  The unit did come with a full set of screws, jus hope I do not have to use them.
B00LEBLI82|2|Disappointed as they are not bright enough and too much green color.
B0059JTOHW|5|Kept my hands warm for as long as they were plugged in. The fit was tight since I wore my normal riding gloves over these liners, but they do exactly what I expected. My only very minor complaint against these gloves is that you cannot change the temperature - it is always set on medium.
B00KTJ1PLU|1|Doesn't work For my car
B00C1YI2XA|5|Good Product
B004XEQN9Q|5|This was the best car seat cover set I have ever had!
B00JA392Q6|5|Worked great on my MINI.
B00279B196|5|Works great. Lot less than auto parts store for same part
B000EQE4OI|5|GOOD
B00HWLQO1O|1|Plan to use these as a strobe but they ground when mounted to the frame.  Very frustrating to finish a project to learn how they are set up since they come with the directions.  They do have a positive and negative wire although they also ground threw their mount.  Seem strong durable and bright but a simple directions or wire schematic would've been appreciated
B000GS8MCY|5|GREAT FIT \\\\ NICE ////
B00L7X9NXO|5|They are great easy to install and fast shipping
B000PS8J64|5|works great under my freezer to avoid water everywhere when defrosting
B00CRHXBZK|1|Dont waste your money bought for my 2011 ecoboost f150 and have nothing but problems get a real tuner not this thing . Yes does wake the ecoboost up but also causes trans shift issues , lean condition issues, when going up a hill truck surges like being towed uphill with a rubber band , and if u put truck in tow haul mode it will put engine into limp mode. Afe should be ashamed to have sold this ther other products are great but this is crap and a hugh waste of money !!!!!!!! And since you bought it on amazon they wont warranty it becaue its not from a aproved dealer
B00DBHFCC0|5|This fits awesome and works great I would definitely order this again
B000E7YP7I|5|I am so glad I decided to splurge on this storage organizer for my trunk.  I was tossed between this model and the larger one. I decided on the smaller due to the price difference.  I have a Hyundai Sonata and this fits perfectly in my trunk with lots of room to spare.  It's large enough to hold groceries.  I think the larger size would have been a trunk hog.  I only had the organizer partially filled and took it for a test drive on sharp turns.  I have a carpet trunk and this organizer didn't slide one bit. If the larger one ever goes on sale I will buy it for my SUV.  I love the construction too.  I looked at others at Pep Boys and this one is so much more sturdy. It can also lay flat if I need to load my trunk with other large items. Very happy with my purchase.
B00A2VHM1W|5|Slips right in...  Use a pocket knife to pop the old won ones out.
B000UVUAFO|1|Doesn't really work well
B0007N3JNU|1|Purchased on 05 Jul 15, dead on arrival and would not take a charge from my UPS or a stand alone Ultima 12V charger.  20+ plus year Navy Electronics Tech so I know a little on the subject.  This is what you really need to know about this battery.  &#34;The battery you purchased, the CSB HC1221W, is covered by a one year manufacturer's warranty against defects in materials and workmanship in manufacturing.  The battery is not guarantied to work for one year, it is warrantied to be free of manufacturing defects for one year.&#34;<br /><br />REALLY....<br /><br />&#34;We can accept a return on a test and advise basis. We will test the battery when received and determine if the battery has a manufacturing defect that would be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. The cost of shipping the battery to us is the responsibility of the customer.&#34;<br /><br />So I should waste another $6.00 sending back a battery that arrived nonfunctional.  Don't think so.  I will eat the cost as I don't want to deal with this type of &#34;warranty&#34;.
B0086I9G58|5|Great product. No complaints.
B001JT12A8|5|my husband loves it but it gets toooo hot during these HOT summer days in Houston
B00275A6JG|5|Great would reccommend
B0028AYDSK|4|The screws that came with them were flat tipped and did not grab the screw holes well. Ended up using the stock ones. Looks great and solid construction.
B00OFKHX8I|1|Poorly made doooo noot buy they kept braking. I did the lift side and one out of three didn't brake, So I give up and put the original ones back in. SUCKS
B00651C9OI|5|Works good and looks good

B00239D2DS|5|Mucho Gusto!
B001AVVWKK|4|Changed the ratio on my Rebel for smoother running in the 30-45 mph area.
B00TVWFOL8|5|[[VIDEOID:624d4514ce574ed9f6103604246d3da4]] Works great.  I used the Aaron 6 ohm load resistors and have no issues.  As advertised the white LED is off when your turn signals are on for added contrast/clarity.
B002XR1PQQ|5|Exactly what I needed to finish my project!
B00NC56BWQ|3|I gave it 3 stars because I like it's deep meaning, but I never recieved the decal!

B0072W6GHK|5|They Work GREAT!!!<br />love the Color... I think if this is the perfect color for HID you don't need to get others color this is it!!! thank You Xentec.
B003VLBPJA|2|Had this for a few months now, stretches very badly, may last one more season. Go green, buy a higher quality one that will last longer!
B000CK9N4M|5|Raybestos makes great brakes parts unfortunately ford uses 2 different pads on the same year vehicle (2011 ford escape XLT)<br />and amazons compatibility software does not  know this , so I ordered these but they do not fit my vehicle . These have the large spring clips mine has the small . Of course I found this out the hard way so learn from my mistake
B00F0U1FYK|4|I returned the rain cover. There was nothing wrong with the delivery and product. The take bag came with a rain cover.
B00WGUJ3AA|3|Product was great but had to return it do to it being bent. No problem returning the product.
B003U4MXPS|1|Failed immediately after being replaced pin for pin with it's previous part. While this may have worked for the two other customers, you have zero consumer protection if this part fails.
B003MC3A0U|5|Works great as advertised.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Holds alot. Strong and very well built.
B0055AIEXA|5|Was exactly the part I needed. OE part. A little difficult to install, but works perfect.
B008Y92GEM|4|Got mine today in the mail. By the price I would imagine I was buying the 4 caps set... for my surprise this item is sold by piece. That means that if you want the set you need to pay 4 x $17.00. The quality looks outstanding and it looks OEM. I would rate it in five stars if the description of the product would have said it is only one cap by that price, it could have saved me the shipping because now I will need to order 3 more. Out of that it's an awesome product. And the shipping was really fast! I can recommend it.
B00FBPWO0S|5|Quality product, just as pictured i have had it 2 years without issues
B00GAA8D5S|5|a good product. a little more complicated to install but after nice!

B00ZJVC2XS|5|Very very bright lights and look to be very well built. Worth the money for the price i paid for them, and they were a snap to install.
B000WJEPA0|2|One wire was long and one was short.!

B0096725JM|4|attached this to the outside of my tool box for more of the everyday tools that I use like screwdrivers and a tape measure make it easier to just grab and go
B00LT41ZR8|1|Junk
B005ZS1SKI|5|Fit perfectly,,,, now I can see behind me!!
B006FUT0CS|4|I used this product today and 2 days ago. The first time it was very dirty. (more dirty than it should be when using this product) With that said it performed wonderful. It cleaned and left an awesome shine on my Super White car. I used more product than I normally would. It breaks down dirt and makes it safer to remove with the right microfiber and technique.<br /><br />I should have sprayed the heavy dirt from the bottom and back panels before, but this gave me insight I would have never attained. It worked on rather heavy dirt with zero scratches. You have to know how to use the microfiber. You can't just spray on and rub it around. You need to use a clean portion to wash the dirt off and dry towel to finish it to a shine. On a dusty car in a garage it is a perfect product. With light dust it's perfect.<br /><br />For those of us without garages and rain and snow we need to be more careful and pick when and what to use on our cars. This product is almost a must have for someone who wants to have a good looking ride at very little effort. Remember, use in the right circumstances and with the right towel, pressure, and amount of product sprayed.<br /><br />I would give this 5 stars but other products are better at cleaning off bug guts and bug crap.tree sap, and other bad stuff. This is great for a car that is relatively clean. Then is really shines. It takes (on a scale on 1-10) a car at a 7-8 to a 9-9.5. Overall excellent product. Recommended by many pros, and me.<br /><br />Edit: After 2 applications of this between washes I can say it really works well. People in dry climates with garages may be able to use this product alone for weeks of months between washes depending on how much you drive. My car is out on the weather. It has rained twice on the product I have applied. It's still very slick. Water beads well. It's easy to clean most stuff off with the slick coating this leaves. I highly recommend it. It's not harsh at all and cleans well and leaves a great coat of shine and protection (from what I have noticed) on Toyota Super White paint.oat of shine and protection (from what I have noticed) on Toyota Super White paint.
B005O01OMY|5|This came with six round double sided discs.  It is mirrored on both sides so I held it up to passenger side to make sure it was right.  The &#34;object appear closer&#34; or whetever is says was also in the right location.  I placed all six discs on the back of the mirror and carefully placed.  My experience with the double sided foam tape gives me great confidence this could outlive the car.  Works perfect and save over $300.
B00QOJW62Q|5|Excellent quality. These work great.
B00ZJ0155U|5|I'm about halfway to the mountains on our family vacation. First, I can't believe the amount of stuff I packed into this bag. I'm about 2 hours in our drive and not a problem at all. No sound, no banging from the wind. Also just drove through a storm hopefully everything is dry. I'll follow up after the trip.
B00PXXTQ9A|5|Works great!  Instructions were a very bad English translation(must have used an online translator)
B00M250FNI|5|Shipped on time and performed as advertised
B00G95W98Q|3|Wont fit hybrid models
B00CKE6WRE|5|Is great
B00BG4LE4U|5|Easy to use and Accurate :)
B00BCRMBSO|5|Great product!
B00GSIXI9S|5|My wife and I just moved & drove 3000+ miles from WA state to VA in her 2001 Acura MDX. I did a full tune up, used this oil and a Bosch filter. Car ran smooth and a lot cooler than when it was using Mobil 1. Every time I would check the dip stick with M1 it would be extremely hot to the touch and consume a tiny bit of oil. Not one time on the trip was the dip stick hot to the touch. The oil level stayed rock solid. The oil didn't even look like it needed to be changed after the trip. There is no looking back, its the best damn oil I have used and I have tried many.
B00OC7TSWI|5|Really good quality,  I bought 2 and have referee several people.
B0053O9EUA|5|worth the money
B0089GBAMO|4|good fit and value
B00J88IBME|5|Bought them for Dad because he loves to motorcycling. He had a pair of these that are already worn out so I decided to buy these for him. It has a great quality and it fits perfectly.
B000IZ49VI|5|A+
B0000AZ8NN|5|As advertised
B008CLNYPC|3|Sort-of decent, for the price paid.  It works ok, but long term, remains to be seen, as I believe it will rust and fall apart quickly.  Made in China, not my preference at all!  I am using it with the Scepter plastic 5 gal can, tight fit, but it works.  The rubber protectors are worthless as they will not stay put.  I figure I will use some weather stripping glue to stick them in place.  Simply put, you get what you paid for, but I think they could do a lot better.
B00AFVRF8Y|5|Hitch is heavily built. I installed on a 1993 Dodge W150. Only had to drill two additional holes in the frame. Fasteners are included. Overkill for a half ton truck, but  fitment is great.
B000BW8LRG|5|love them and my chevy 454 loves them
B000RZPNOQ|5|Excellant product.
B00ZE20ZHW|5|Easy to apply and it looks great.
B00V3M8YNY|4|It looks great on my blue F150xlt, the only thing is it plastic but for the price  you can't beat it.  I've had them for a month now and it hasn't  chipped  yet. I would recommend this to anyone looking  to give there vehicle a new look at a cheap price.
B0047W2JHO|5|This looks great on my car! I love it!!!
B007F08YRY|5|Works good in my Acura Integra. A little too small maybe for my liking, but good product.
B00O1T056A|2|Bought this in May, hoping it would be there if needed. In august 2015' the time finally came. My car would NOT start. I brought out my Anker jump starter and following instructions; hooked it up. NOTHING!  Would NOT start my car. Recharged the unit overnight and tried again the next day. Still would NOT start my car. The car only has a 2.6 L engine.  Had to get a plug in battery charger to get car started. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WANTING GOOD RESULTS.
B00CR1RGBG|3|Not as good as 3M but so much cheaper. Touch decision to make.
B00JBIBX12|2|Headlamps came with the incorrect low beam connection, one wasn't sealed at the top of the assembly and one parking lamp connector was slightly larger than its counterpart. All in all, after a run to the auto parts store, I was able to get it functional.
B00FB7Y58U|5|Good product, timely delivery.
B0007LZI8G|5|Fit my 2&#34; ball very nicely!
B001G4Z5J0|5|Exactly what we needed.
B003AT6CUA|5|Fits on my 2011 Hyundai Elantra Limited and works great.  No issues and appears to be very well made.
B002XPD8MW|5|OEM wipers. Came in original BMW packaging. Works as expected - absolutely satisfied.
B00CXMJAPY|5|If you are not going with the BHR $500 coil pack for your RX8 then use these.  My coils and plugs were beginning to fail, these work fine.  No issues with installation and I immediately noticed better performance and gas mileage. Cant speak to how long they will last, but the factory ones often fail at 30k miles so I doubt these are any better or worse. Fair price for the right product, on time shipping.
B007DJDH9C|5|Great bag and build quality.
B0012RN3AY|5|Great price
B009EACHNK|5|Perfect fit and quality was better than expected. Literally just switched the old ones out. Easy install, just took off door panels, removed triangular speaker covers, removed one H45 bolt and unplugged the old mirror, then reversed the process to install. Everything lined up fine and the color black matte finish matches the red car fine...no need to even paint. Highly recommend these mirrors. Can't beat the price and it was fast shipping.
B0010GAZOE|5|Works great, easy install. Lower cost here than anywhere else I looked.
B0025CNJXQ|5|Working perfectly at about 2000 miles.
B000ABGAU8|5|Excellent. It stopped the vehicle's leaking issue and lasted all through the winter. Wonderful value and finally something that works as stated :)
B00032KBFE|5|Just like real screws
