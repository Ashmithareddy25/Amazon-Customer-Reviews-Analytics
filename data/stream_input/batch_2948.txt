B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Keeps me on my toes! Its a lot of fun and a great way to pass time! I love that its constantly changing!
B00E89VXQY|4.0|A great live album but one glaring omission, Through the Never, the song in which the film (soundtrack) is named after in not included...hmmm
B00FA5MU58|4.0|Metallica comes at us hard and heavy with Through the Never- a concept film about some surreal goings-on surrounding one of their shows when a young PA is sent out to retrieve something for the band and ends up way over his head.  I'm old enough that the whole idea reminds me of Duran Duran's Arena- and this should be just as enjoyable as that was back in the day.<br /><br />From the familiar opening strains of Ecstasy of Gold complemented with audience participation, Through The Never is a damn good concert release, a double cd recorded from their 2012 tour.  The film itself is reported to have only fourteen songs featured while the cd has sixteen, so you'll get a little extra for your money.  And it's pretty sweet; mixing a few old joints in with the better known stuff... My personal faves here were Creeping Death, Ride the Lightning, Hit the Lights- yeah, baby!  It even seems like some of the band's stage dialogue from the film got included as well, but we'll see if that's what it was.  A final nice touch is the last track- a newer recording of \\"Orion\\"- probably used for the film's end credits, and it sounds great!  Cliff Burton would've liked it.<br /><br />You could argue that TTN is just another live cd, and you're right- it is.  But again, it's a good one that'll make you want to check out the movie- like a soundtrack should do- and worth the ten bucks you'd spend on the download.
B007L5KT76|4.0|I grew up watching pretty much every Holmes movie or TV show ever done and this movie, as the previous one, is  just marvelous.<br />Downey and Law are both wonderful in their roles and bring a chemistry of realistic friendship rarely seen in movies. They are at once stoically caring of each other and antagonistic. The writing, the acting, the cast, the settings are all fantastic.<br />Whenever I can't find anything worth watching I repeatedly come back and watch these two movies again and again and have yet to tire of them.<br />Just marvelous movies and I hope we might see a third in the future.
B00D6JX3OM|5.0|Sting's latest release, The Last Ship, is in his own words, both a memoir to his growing up in Wallsend, an English shipbuilding town, and a tribute to working class people in general.  It's also the basis for a play he's developing and a very personal, emotional and stirring album depicting a way of life that's coming to an end and its affect on the community.  From the romantic reminiscings of a street brawler wooing the love of his life, a man in love with a woman who doesn't love him to a son's rebellion against his father's wishes to follow in his footsteps taking up a dead end job because it's tradition- The Last Ship displays some amazing imagery and storytelling from a modern day master bard.  The music is mainly traditional English folk and shanty, even a jig & reel, incorporating all the styles and instrumentation- fiddles, penny whistles, accordians, bagpipes, bodhran drums, clog dancing, etc- you'd expect, especially in today's music landscape dominated with bands like Mumford & Sons.  But what's surprising is the assortment of guest appearances on the cd, including Jimmy Nail and AC/DC's Brian Johnson, of all people.<br /><br />Last Ship is a beautifully rendered, absolutely poetic project full of heart and humanity.  If the stage version lives up to the music, it'll really be something to see.
0385523912|4.0|This book was quite an eye opener about life in North Korea.  I was really shocked to learn about the horrible conditions that these people had to endure.  Sometimes I found it difficult to read because the conditions were so dismal.  However, I found it enlightening, informative, and well written.
0452295548|5.0|A Great book and a great leader. I find the brain fascinating and the author gives a detailed explanation of how different parts of the brain work from her own personal experience and education and determination. There is hope for everyone who has ever suffered some minor and major brain damage. This book will give you a better understanding that almost anything is possible in the recovery of abilities regardless of the brain damage and the time it takes. The brain keeps working to help us all the time whatever the circumstances. Our brain is very complicated and a miracle worker. Thank You, Doctor Jill Bolte Taylor. I ordered 5 books so I could give them away to friends and loved ones.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you ve made it through the first four, number five will not disappoint. In fact, you might be sad to be nearing the end. Epic tale that has just as many twists and turns.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I found this book compelling and unable to put down from beginning to end. It is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love and addicted! Really great cast- everyone is such a good actor. Wonderfully written. Beautiful locations. I feel as if I've been there because they make it so familiar for the watchers.

B004Q3SGWG|5.0|Thought it would be painfully slow watching one guy trying to figure a way out of his predicament but the time went<br />by quickly.  Drama, suspense, humor, nice scenery.  Would watch it again.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Brandon you have done Robert proud!  I lost track between your two styles and as per the rest of the series was caught up in the grandeur that is &#34;The Wheel of Time&#34;  A fantastic series that I've enjoyed so much so all I can do is say a large &#34;Thank You&#34;.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Loved this book.  Started with a library copy which expired and then bought it right away so I could finish it.  Learned a lot about the country of Afghanistan as well.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Having read both Hosseini's previous books, I found this one lacklustre and nowhere near as riveting as the Kite runner.

B00BFV1M0U|3.0|I liked this book, gave the reader more answers to the questions posed in The Maze Runner. Some interesting new characters introduced.
B008476HBM|5.0|It is a great story and was obtained at no charge. How great is that? Debatably the best Jane Austen story.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Period. If it sounds too easy to be true.....it is! I guess you need to be a techie to work it. Far from the \\"123\\" instructions they make you believe. I'll be returning it. I spent enough time on it already. Plug and play? NOT!
B00E0SX118|5.0|the art work was in this movie took alot of imagination and seems to me i meet a little girl like the croods younger daughter
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I love when books connect so many random characters and intertwine them into a great story. This book brought me the full range of emotions. I highly recommend this!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I have followed or started to follow dozens of TV and premium channel series with varying degrees of satisfaction. For my money, Walking Dead is the best. It consistently delivers high drama, intensity and gritty realism. There never seems to be a filler episode. Everything is on-plot, moving things forward and upping the ante and/or revealing new shockers. Really well done series!
B00C061I1M|4.0|Valerie's voice is haunting. I gave it four stars because a few of the songs sounded similar. I do recommend it though. You Can't Be Told and the title song are great. I would recommend to you if you liked the Civil Wars. Very similar.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I hardly know what to say about this magical, yet creepy, little book. In some ways, it was everything I hoped it would be. For certain, I couldn't put it down once I started reading. In other ways, I found it disturbing and, in part, a bit unsatisfactory.<br /><br />NOTE: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />My biggest problem is that the ending of The Ocean at the End of the Lane felt unfinished to me, but then I find endings where the hero of the book forgets everything that has happened to him to be as big a cop-out as the ones where the entire story turns out to be a dream. It just doesn't cut it. It smacks of not really knowing how you want to wrap things up. I realize saying this might be a sacrilege to my fellow Gaiman fans, and I apologize for that. I was completely fascinated by the story, and many things were done very well. But the ending . . . sorry. Not so much so.<br /><br />On the plus side, I love stories told from a child's perspective, and this was no exception. I found the young boy at the heart of the tale to be charming and clever, even if extremely precocious for a seven-year old. He had me from the birthday party that no one showed up for. I loved all the mystery and magic of the world he uncovered, and his observations of unfolding events were droll and wise. He was plucky and brave, in spite of his inner fear, and possessed all of the elements I enjoy in a central character.<br /><br />I also truly enjoyed the Hempstock women who lived in the house at the end of the lane, in front of the ocean of the book's title. Lettie, her mother, and her grandmother were remarkable characters. What I don't understand is why none of the many reviews I read after I finished the book mentioned the most obvious thing about them, namely, that they seemed to represent the Wiccan tradition of the Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone. I expected to read a lot of comments adressing that, but saw none. Curious.<br /><br />These powerful women also seemed to have elements reaching even farther back into mythology to the three Fates. Clotho, the spinner, who spins the thread of life; Lachesis, the measurer, who chooses the lot in life one will have, and measures off how long it is to be; and Atropos, who uses her shears to cut the thread of life when it is time for one's death. Maybe it's just me, but I certainly saw elements of both the Wiccan figures and the Fates in those mysterious Hempstock women. But of course, we each get something different out of every book we read.<br /><br />In spite of the things I was less than satisfied with, overall, the story was haunting, beautiful, and compelling, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is a fan of fantasy or magic. Neil Gaiman readers should love it. I did, even while wanting more from the ending. Bents reaching even farther back into mythology to the three Fates.

0399255370|5.0|The concept that the crayons left notes for Duncan about their dismay is a little steep for my 3 year old, but the pictures, the colors, and the emotions expressed in this book will be a favorite for years to come. Love it!

143353083X|4.0|The ESV study bible has proven indispensable in my Old Testament theology course. The translation is absolutely stunning, and is probably the truest to the actual words of the Hebrew and Greek texts on the market today.<br /><br />The buyer should be aware that the study materials and footnotes are written from a very conservative, Evangelical perspective for a very conservative, Evangelical audience. As a somewhat conservative mainline Protestant, there are a few contentions in the footnotes and supplementary texts that caused me to raise some eyebrows (see a footnote on page 65 for Genesis 9:5-6 that outright supports the death penalty), but nothing so serious as to detract from the outstanding quality of this work. For the most part, the accompanying material is relevant, engaging, and thought provoking (perhaps most of all because I may disagree with the editors on some points!)<br /><br />So to conclude, the ESV Study Bible should not scare away center-right, middle-of-the road or even moderately liberal mainline protestants. The clarity of its translation and faithfulness to the source texts is, for me, a welcome retreat from the NRSV, a translation which (particularly in the Old Testament) let political correctness wedge itself between the source text and the translation. The only folks who should avoid this are far-left of center Christians in any denomination. The lack of gender neutrality and the word-for-word translation methodology employed will undoubtedly bug you.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|It took forever to receive this package but it was worth it. I binged and watceh the whoe thing in two days.  Now i need to share the DVDs with friends so they can enjoy it too.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|This is one of the best animated movies that has been released in several years. It has a great storyline, great animation, and a great moral to the story. I don't want to give away details, but it you have children or you're still a child at heart, you will love it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I was introduced to Star Wars as a kid by my older sibling so I was excited to revisit it and watch it again. I felt like I bought the trilogy at a good price and I was not disappointed. I received the set in a timely manner and each DVD was in great condition (I think it was unopened if I remember correctly). Great transaction -- no complaints.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|The 3D rendition is awesome and this is a spectacular movie on a large scale!<br />Very enjoyable, absolutely entertaining and incredible scenes, funny and fast paced.
B0093QHWLC|4.0|Cant believe i waited so long to see this movie, intense with alot of twists and turns you don't see coming
0810993139|4.0|I am a student of year 8 and our English teacher told us to read that book as a kind of reward for the English lessons of the last year.<br />I think that book is fantastic.It is a typical book for teenagers.Greg is the main charachter of this book and he has a big family.Greg has a best friend, his name is Rowley.Greg has two brothers, the older brother is Rodrick and the little brother is Manny.<br />I like the structure particularly because it allows you to organize your reading process easily.<br />I like the cartoons because they are really funny and because they are printed in black and white. Even the speech bubbles are lovely. Moreover I adore the cover and Greg`s life. He is so funny and always he is in trouble with girls, the family or his school. Greg is weird, nasty and he usually acts clumsily. That is why I can identify with him. I recommend the book to kids, teenagers and adults.<br /><br />Celina Drexler
0061124265|5.0|The story is so fantastic, and the writer's style is superb!! Very addicting. Really hard to put it down once you start reading...

B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book was a surprise to me at all levels.  This is my introduction to Brandon Sanderson,  so I was a little wary of the reviews and hype around it, but I figured with 1000 or so readers who loved it enough to review and give it 5-stars, I could give it a try.<br /><br />The author is a master of creating enthralling fantasy settings, and for the first part of the book I was immersed in this vividly painted world.  Character-building is also superb; I came to love these characters through their trials and triumphs.  But, to be honest, I did think it a little slow in the beginning, the action interspersed with debates on religion and philosophy and self-exploration.  But this gives the story its own particular flavor, reminding me of the knights of old and their codes of honor.  So if a reader is looking for a book with nonstop action for the entire journey, you will have to exercise patience.<br /><br />And your patience will be rewarded. I took note of the page, 507.  It was the page where my jaw dropped when I realized that I loved this book,  loved what the author created, loved the characters, loved the emotions.  I realized that the first half of the book was necessary to create characters that come to life in such a way that the payoff at the end was so very satisfying.  And from page 507 on, I could  not put the book down.  I had not expected the book to be so much fun, but it was.  The action piled on until the epic finale.<br /><br />I am now a  Sanderson fan, and I can't wait for the next 1000 pages, which I suspect will seem much too short for me.
B00F6HOW4M|5.0|StonefoxMedia From YouTube review: Definitely an Album made for Driving. There are many high and low songs in it. Most songs on this album reference relationships and that's fine. Its good to hear an artist break from the monotonous Dance music. A definite must have for anyone who wants something original.
B002SJIO4A|3.0|This movie seemed disjointed. Characters were ambivalent about who they were and placed in unlikely circumstances. Aliens seemed intelligent yet lived in squalor. With their level of intelligence I would have expected decent living quarters. And if himanlike, romance was all but eliminated within the Alien community. If Aliens are to have human characteristics, let them have all.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|A good afternoon movie, I would see it again. However, it is not as suspenseful as I hoped it would be.<br />Good acting.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|I don't feel competent in judging this movie simply because I didn't understand it.  Perhaps if I find the inclination I could watch it again until it makes sense. Meanwhile it occupies a place on my shelf with other DVD's slated for the Salvation Army.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Although there are a lot of \\"The Walking Dead\\" shows out there, this one still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Done well.<br /><br />Puedie
B007REV4T8|2.0|Boring... weak plot....no energy in acting....too many bad guys....waste of my money. Seems something fresher could have graced the screen.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|Good movie, would recommend. Daughter took DVD to college. Family enjoying Blu-ray and son downloaded digital copy to his PC
B0018M6J90|5.0|It is a refreshing movie.  All the characters were fine actors expecially McDormand and Adams....What a change from the shoot em up bang bang movies littering the film world today. .
B0091THDOM|5.0|Few months back I bought this product and the case was too tight and the card slot could only hold one card which was also harder (tighter) to use. I gave one star and wrote my disappointed review exactly how I felt about the product, I also tried some other similar products and I was not 100% satisfied either. A week ago Snugg sent me a free case claiming that they have improved the usability,  it looked  exactly same  as before and I was skeptical at first to even try it, to my surprise the new product is very PERFECT. The phone fits perfectly..taking in-and-out is very smooth on both phone slot and card slot!! It is bit tighter if I try to put too many cards in the card slot but if I put two cards it is perfect.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|i really liked Pulse, having used nike fuel band i prefer Pulse because its small, discreet & can be put in pocket.<br />unlike other ecosystem Pulse more open and tracked data can be shared with other apps.<br /><br />my withings pulse  didn't work after 10days, i tweeted to withings twitter account &  the customer service  was exceptional, they very extremely helpful arranged to send me replacement Pulse. only wish the rubbery case design was more sturdy, as sometimes pulse tends to slips out of case.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|love the ability to print from iPad and iPhone. wish I could turn printer on from anywhere! makes printing easy
0307352153|3.0|being an introvert that has struggled all my life to act more like an extrovert, i was hoping this book would help me come to terms with myself. in some ways, it does. it offers examples of famous introverts that have been leaders and uses this example to show the strength introverts can bring to business situations.<br /><br />however, overall i found this book to be really convoluted and repetitive. it really could have done with some better editing. i also did not like the christian tidbits, as i am not christian and did not think i was signing on for a religious book when i picked it up. i truly do not see the point in including religion in the book at all. it makes no difference what religion you are or aren't- there are introverts in every walk of life. isn't that the point?<br /><br />there is some important information in this book to soothe introverts, but it is no 'page-turner.' expect the desire to want to skip ahead. (which i did after reading to page 27 and being supremely bored- i opened it up to a random chapter) i would suggest to not buy this on kindle because you won't be able to skip ahead if you get bored.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I got about half way and even that was a chore.  I so looked forward to reading this book but I have to admit that I increasingly found myself NOT believing what I was reading. I do believe in NDE's but do not believe this author. SO just gave up!!  I hate to be a quitter BUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002QYTQ3K|5.0|Blade Runner came out when I was Young (early 20s). I thought then and still think it is the most amazing piece of in your face storytelling. The imagery is amazing along with the idea of replacants(androids) that can feel and remember being a child growing up. Decker, the main character, is a cop who is tasked with identifyting and &#34;retiring&#34; unruly replecants. He comes upon one who is special. She become special to him. After destroying the killer replecants, surviving their attacks on him and deaths of all others. He returns to her and the rest is...history,lol. You won't regret watching this movie. It's classic science fiction at its best.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|A little campy with the mix of old style language and modern slang.  Great for learning all the intertwined relationships of the nobles.
B000HZCZZ6|5.0|After defeating the Borg, the Enterprise is doing diplomatic duty, and not enjoying it. They're wishing for time to explore and do some science and other endevors. Data is on a short assignment on a &#34;duck blind study&#34;, when they get a request for his schematics. They go to find out what went wrong with Data. This begins as a mystery, and mysteries must be solved. Why are the Federation involved with the Soma? They are basically thugs and pirates. Why are Federation people lying to them? How do they save the Baku? So the adventure begins. Alot of laughs, intrigue, some romance, battles, and good old Star Trek look at life (now and future). Directed by Johnathon Frakes, it's a home run.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|This book is an enjoyable read, and Timothy Ferriss' advice is helpful.  I've tried the high protein/slow-carb diet that he recommends.  It really does take the weight off.
B000YG0DQG|4.0|I thought the idea of teaming Blade with his 'enemies' was quite interesting. He actually had a love interest with the vampire princess, who turned out to be a 'good guy'. The evil one was Scud the vampire familiar who was working for Blade whom he, of course knew about, and got the better of, lol. The reason for the vampires asking for Blades help was for something that was created by their own leader, the vampire king. The poor princesse's brother, betrayed and out for revenge. Great action and a great story. Watch it and cheer for Blade and a recovered Whistler!
B00DXP7L88|5.0|Just finished watching the final episode and boy was it a tearjerker!  Sad to hear so many negative reviews.  I enjoyed the series from beginning to end.  And not to give anything away, but I think the ending as sad as it was, left it open ended.  Sometimes those are the best endings.  I really like the journey Dexter makes throughout the series and him realizing that he isn't such a monster after all and has a capacity to love.  Season 8 really shows this.  This season was also one of Jennifer Carpenter and Michael C. Hall's best performances.  Their chemistry together is hard to find.  Deb's personal journey was also gutwrenching at times.  Really looking forward to rewatching this season when it's comes out on DVD.  Adding it to my collection of the series.<br /><br />It really does have a ending that makes you think afterwords and to why things happened the way they did.  Much like Lost's series finale. I hope you enjoy Dexter's final season :-)
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Iron Man 3 takes you into the heart of Tony Stark. He's suffering from PTSD after the battle in New York with the Avengers. Pepper and Rhodes are still at his side, but don't know what to make of his latest behavior. Tony turns to what he does best, building. The enemy in this movie, is a dork of the first order. He has no conscience. He took a think tank and turned it into a destructive force of vengeance. Pepper gets kidnapped, so its up to Tony with help from Rhody and a new friend. An old friend works for the idiot and tries to stop him, but to no avail. Tony and Rhody save the day with help from Tonys building spree. The ending is eye candy worth seeing. This Robert Downey Jr. at his best. A don't miss.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Still one of the best novels. My tween daughter read it for a book report and fell in love with the characters. She couldn't put it down.  Just what I knew would happen!
B001RJXA7S|4.0|This is where we are first introduced to Blade and his mentor Whistler. They are what stands between humanity and Vampires. He is the qintessencial warrior against vampires. He has all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses. To get around the craving for blood, Blade has a serum. The villian is the one who killed his mother the night he was born. He plans to become a god. Yeah. Blade saves a Doctor who happens to come up with a cure for vampirism, and a few trick for Blade. It's also a trip down memory lane for Blade. A bad trip, but with the Docs help he wins the day. Whistler on the other hand vanishes, at the hand of vampires...  Stay tuned for Blade II !
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Awesome! Could hardly put the book down. Was interesting getting to know new characters. Glad Percy is back though in the next book.

B009LOJK1Q|2.0|If a writer of Stephen King's measure has to rely on child abuse, both sexual and physical and September 11th to engage us as readers, it's a sad day indeed. Doesn't Mr King realize that these subjects are already so nightmarish that even his treatment of them, as a writer, can't make them worse than their reality? Sure, we expect something special from this man, but the aforementioned subjects are easy targets and targets that are still too raw for some people to digest as the stuff of classic horror. I expect better than 'easy targets' from Mr King. I think he would have been wise to realize that survivors of 9/11 and their families might not appreciate some sections of the book.<br /><br />I do not think that this is a return to form for him at all. Instead of finding this greatly anticipated novel a classic in his genre I found at times the subject matter to be revolting and offensive.  I don't think revolting and offensive is what we usually get with Stephen King, we usually get mind churning, 'don't look under the bed' creeps (often from mundane and seemingly harmless things or people) and that's what I read him for. The way he usually weaves his words is hypnotic and graceful.  I really don't know what happened in this book, it's harsh and lacks style. The first half of the book, for me at any rate, is so uncharacteristic I could hardly believe he'd written it.  The second part of the book does return to form in some sections, but it still feels to lack much of the incredible style so many of us have come to love.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Interesting book.  Very informative.  As with anything Tesla related, there is a fair amount of one sided speculation regarding conspiracies against him.  We will probably never know the whole truth.  Fun to speculate about his world-wide free energy invention and how the world would be so much more passive rather than hording fossil fuels.

B00EDPFJA4|5.0|I won't go into great detail about this album, I will leave that to other individuals that try to sound smart and use words they never use except when writing an album review. This album is very good. The production is great one of the best I've heard, the tracks are so well blended and stylistically put together right up there with a Beatles album. If you are a pure hip hop fan this album is not for you, if you are a 2 chainz fan this album is not for you (unfortunately the afore mentioned is on the deluxe edition). From a hip hop perspective this album will seem too pop, from a 2 chainz/chief keef perspective this wont be \\"hype\\" enough. For a lover of music; whether it be r&b, pop, or hip hop this album is a must own. Drake really tries different things on each of his albums and luckily most of them work. Great album and nothing is the same!

B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Again, 2013 gives us a well-rounded film in the form of Now You See Me. This movie is purely, yet simply awesome. Everyone who has not yet seen this movie should definitely watch it. Here are my thoughts.<br /><br />What we have are a team of magicians and a agent determined to bring them down. This powerhouse cast consists of: Mark Ruffalo as Dylan the FBI agent, Michael Caine as Arthur Tressler, Dave Franco as Jack Wilder, Isla Fisher portraying Henley, Woody Harrelson as Merritt Mckinney, Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley, Melanie Laurent as Alma Dray, Jesse Eisenberg as Daniel, and rapper/rising actor Common makes minor appearances as Agent Evans. The whole cast was great; I was really impressed with Mark Ruffalo's performance and Jesse Eisenberg is quite the catch.<br /><br />The story in this movie is not as simple as some would think it is. Sure, it DOES involve magic, illusion, and the art of deception, but expect some major surprises (especially towards the 3rd act) and many questions left that will hopefully be answered in the sequel.<br /><br />I would honestly give Now You See Me a solid perfect score, although I do wish that a few things had been handled better. Nonetheless, Now You See Me is not only a cool, fun movie, IT IS entertaining. Out of 10 I give this movie:<br /><br />9/10

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I liked this book.  Presenting the story of Jesus from a historical standpoint makes for an interesting experience.  As a Christian, I was surprised at all the clamor about this book, as though it was robbing Jesus of his divinity.  I, on the other hand, found the book to be an intriguing take on what secular history knows about the man, Jesus, and the life he lived.  It was refreshing to look at him as a young Jewish man, a son, a brother, a neighbor, and a shaper of history.  Whatever you believe about his divinity, this book takes the story of his life and tells it in the context of the world into which he was born.  Definitely worth reading.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Dr. Lawrence Krauss explains the history of physics which has led up to his current theory at a level that most readers can comprehend.  About midway through the book there are some parts where he goes pretty deep and you may have to read this part twice.  Overall it is an outstanding composition with physics explained with a mixture of wit and humor that only Dr. Krauss can pull off.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|Not a great movie in my opinion. I'm a brad pitt fan but this movie just felt forced. Still somewhat entertaining.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I cannot begin to do justice to this book.  It shows the resilience and the man who was Christopher Hitchens.  Even to his death he kept writing, even when he could no longer endure the pain of speaking his fingers kept flying across the keyboard, trying to get out one more sentence.  To the end he stood up for his principles.  You are dearly missed.

0375707972|4.0|What a beautifully written novel. I was worried at first, as I had already seen and loved the movie. Only a handful of times have I watched a movie and then loved the book, and visa versa. But the movie was true to the original story, brilliantly so. Schlink has written a moving, soulful love story, and when the story involves Auschwitz and concentration camps and death marches, that is an extremely difficult thing to do. You feel for Michael and Hanna and want them to be together, but on the other hand, you understand their separation. It was wrong for them to be together and it was wrong for them to be apart. Though Michael was young, his adult descriptions and observations of Hanna are compelling and erotic without being creepy. He truly loved her and I loved reading about him.<br />Hanna was a little different. She was flaky and strange and I'm still not sure why she up and left Michael. Her actions were deplorable but the way the other women turned on her was cruel. She was broken and hollow and the ending doesn't surprise me. The overall feeling of this book, in a word, is melancholy. Both characters are beaten down and never quite get back up.
B00F6HOW4M|5.0|I really like Drake's newest CD. I am not a big hip-hop listener and I don't usually listen to main stream artist (aside from Mumford and sons) and I love this CD. His music gets you excited. He allows you enough room to think about his lyrics, and your own feelings. I love music that isn't just fun to listen to but music that makes you think. Drake does exactly that.

I love this game but to get enough bits and gems to buy some of the main characters you need to level up and complete the game would take an estimated two years. I got to a point where my only option is to buy gems and bits from the shop. But when I did this a few times my purchases weren't delivered to my kindle fire. My advise, cleft this app 'cause it's fun and free but don't spend a single penny on it.

1250007208|4.0|Cinder is one of those books that everyone really loved and raved about, so I knew I had to get my hands on a copy. Welp, I finally (I know!) read it and I have to say, I'm thoroughly glad I did. Not many books live up to the hype but this is certainly one of them. Cinderella wasn't exactly my favourite fairy tale but when you put a futuristic spin on it, suddenly, it becomes totally awesome!<br /><br />This book brings a fresh, new twist to fairy tale retellings with its heavy science fiction influence and incredible future-filled world building. You can definitely see the parallels between it and the original source material but the connections aren't so blatant that you're able to predict exactly where the story is going to end. That being said, there were a few big revelations regarding Cinder's true identity that I was able to pinpoint pretty early in, but overall, they didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />There's a lot going on in Cinder --- androids, lunars, cyborgs, classism, intergalactic war --- but it's all woven together in a way that makes sense. And futhermore, there's the romance, familial relationships and friendships that bind it all together. Admittedly, I was more entranced by the Meyer's storytelling and compelling plot than I was by the actual characters which isn't to say they were bad, because they weren't. While I liked Cinder and Kai, they didn't captivate me in the way they seemed to do with everyone else. Instead, I was more interested in the book's secondary characters: Iko, Dr. Erland, Pearl, even Queen Levana. I guess I just didn't connect with the MC's as much as the others, though I did feel for their situations (equality struggles, political problems, etc.).<br /><br />Overall, I'd say Cinder was a fast-paced, fun read with a unique premise and culturally distinct setting which meshed so well with the book's futuristic vibe. What really intrigued me was Meyer's ability to add so much dimension to such a familiar tale by infusing so many diverse ideas into it. While I expected to engage a bit more with the MC's and though some of the surprises were anticipated, I wasn't at all disappointed. The book definitely lives up to the hype! I'm really excited to see how Meyer will weave this story into her next set of fairytales and am wondering exactly how they'll all manage to find their happily ever after.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Cinder is one of the few stories that actually lives up to all the hype. A little bit classic and a lot sci-fi, it puts a fresh spin on fairy tale retellings. Though I wasn't as taken with our MC as much as some of the others, this book is a fun, quick read that will entrance a whole new generation of fairy tale lovers with its incredible uniqueness and wonderful world building. I'm really excited to see what other adventures we can get into in the sequel.ale by infusing so many diverse ideas into it.

B00EDPFJA4|2.0|On his junior album, Drake seems to be suffering from an identity crisis.  Ironically Drake does have talent, but he has yet to learn the art of juggling various styles on an album. Drake is stronger with the singing side of the album evident in the huge single Hold On, We're Going Home\\" (featuring Majid Jordan) and Own It. When it comes to rapping Drake shines on Tuscan Leather, Started From The Bottom, Pound Cake\\" / \\"Paris Morton Music 2\\" (featuring Jay-Z). Nothing else on the album really grabbed me but I'm sure the masses will love it. Had Drake spilit the album into discs similar to the way Tyrese did with [[ASIN:B000J20D4C Alter Ego]] or Beyonce did with [[ASIN:B002QY9RMA I Am...Sasha Fierce]] then he may have a better album.
B00DJZR46G|4.0|(A 21-track deluxe edition featuring two exclusive tracks is available only at Target.)<br /><br />The concept behind \\"The Diving Board,\\" Elton John's sophisticated new offering - his first solo outing since 2006's criminally underrated \\"The Captain and the Kid\\" - is one of simplicity, of intentionally harking back to the stark, literate sound he quietly descended upon downtown Los Angeles with in 1970 when he powerfully made his American debut at the Troubador.<br /><br />That alone makes it a worthy, often harrowing listen, though the songwriting itself is unquestionably ripened, wizened and mature in perspective - that John and lyricist Bernie Taupin are no longer the two lads who wrote \\"Your Song\\" and \\"The Greatest Discovery\\" is quite clear - making for an intriguing, if at first alarming, and not always successful, musical dichotomy.<br /><br />When Taupin is at his best it is something to behold. Lead single \\"Home Again,\\" the most radio-friendly tune among the dozen, is achingly beautiful and universal in its sentiments without a trace of treacle, beckoning one of John's most buttery, ingratiating melodies. \\"Oscar Wilde Gets Out\\" is as epic as one of his early 70s story songs, and John responds with a bone-chilling performance.<br /><br />\\"Oceans Away\\" is a classy, dignifying, and, above all, poetic tribute to the Greatest Generation and those they left behind in World War II. John's matter-of-fact, graceful vocal underscores the pathos and power of Taupin's key points, and his playing is arresting and rapturous.<br /><br />There are also moments where one cannot help but be reminded of Taupin's claim that he is writing lyrics now by and large as \\"a hobby.\\" While the results of songs such as \\"Mexican Vacation\\" and \\"A Town Called Jubilee\\" are certainly listenable, with John's piano obscuring some of their lesser qualities, they call no individual attention to themselves and are not memorable, with no huggably warm sounds to anchor them. In the past, such as on 1997's \\"The Big Picture,\\" John has been able to squeeze out juicy melodies to some of Taupin's worst lyrics, but on \\"The Diving Board,\\" where his once-in-a-lifetime way with a piano is front and center to achieve a certain sound, by necessity lessening the importance of melody, the lyrical shortcomings are more obvious, especially because John has long been keen to giftwrap Taupin's words, regardless of poetic worth, in maximally melodic packaging.<br /><br />Still, selections that impress and comfortably remind of previous majesty cannot be denied. Taupin's lyrics for \\"Voyeur\\" bring out the ever-adventurous side of John's pallette, with kinetic, undeniable energy. It is the kind of song that might have been compromised by the loud, overproduced atmosphere of albums like \\"The Big Picture\\" or 1992's otherwise powerful \\"The One.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart,\\" John sings with uncommon passion before diving into a brazen, enchanting solo, the likes of which longtime listeners associate with albums such as \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\\"<br /><br />Furthermore, \\"The Diving Board\\" is anchored by three instrumental solos that, quite predictably, are marvelous and attention-seizing. The third of these, \\"Dream No. 3,\\" is easily one of the best moments of John's career, winding down into the loungey, bluesy title track.<br /><br />One unique trait of Sir Elton's is that his compound professionalism and genius as a musician has never eluded him, not even in periods where his life was at a particularly low ebb. The result is that he has never crafted an album without something wortwhile resulting - those mid-80s LPs may have had filler, but the gems, once found, were unquestionable. Similar can be said here, only this time the highlights are less radio-friendly, yet more plentiful and with more weight and substance, and now instead of personal demons creeping into the music he has two lovely young boys and a happy, healthy marriage which meaneven more to him than his career. That comfortability waves in some less than compelling moments into \\"The Diving Board\\" but is also its asset - relieved of the burden to find a hit single or cater to the casual listener, John presents himself with a take-it-or-leave-it attitude, making the gambles really count and giving the highlights extra grist.<br /><br />One does hope, however, that he will return to the atittude of 2001's \\"Songs from the West Coast.\\" Though more reined in than \\"The Diving Board,\\" it proved he could go back to the template of his classic albums without sacrificing those instantly memorable melodic hooks.even more to him than his career.

B00DGGIXS6|4.0|Cher is never even the slightest bit phoney in an industry where phoney is the name of the game. That matter-of-fact generosity of spirit informs 2013's aptly-titled \\"Closer to the Truth\\" and makes it a more winning formula than it would be in the hands of a lesser vocalist. Her large, purple voice propels the songs, regardless of their intrinsic value, making her long awaited return a welcome one.<br /><br />While the album lacks the big, bursting energy of singles like \\"Strong Enough\\" and \\"Song for the Lonely,\\" tunes that beckoned repeated plays and airwave saturation, it has a more varied style of songs and a consistently higher quality of material. While the second half of the \\"Living Proof\\" album, for instance, contained smatterings of definite filler, with \\"Closer to the Truth\\" that is not the case. Each selection showcases a facet of Cher's outsized personality.<br /><br />The album is frontloaded with tunes ripe for the dance floor. Lead single \\"A Woman's World\\" is fluffy, infectious fun - when she cries out that she's \\"strong enough to rise above - this is a woman's world!\\" it's hard to do anything to believe her, the sentiment coming as it does from the mouth of a woman who seemingly survives all.<br /><br />\\"Take It Like a Man\\" featuring Jake Shears and the attitudinal \\"Dressed to Kill\\" also get the sweat dripping and the grooves flashing. Even though her delivery could perhaps benefit from a little more menace on the latter, her understatedness is also a statement in itself - with a track record like hers, what is there left to prove or question?<br /><br />\\"Lovers Forever,\\" which Cher co-pens, is arguably the best of the dance-pop selections, with its insistent, chugging and swirling synths. The up-and-down nature of the melody gives her singing ability a highly listenable workout. It's destined to fill dance floors and workout playlists.<br /><br />Of particular importance are \\"I Walk Alone,\\" \\"Red\\" and \\"Favorite Scars.\\" All three accent the niche she has carved with her extreme sustenance and longevity. \\"Red\\" in particular is a shot of grizzled, worldy-wise near-cynicism perfectly suited to Cher, anchored by a repetitive but catchy pop hook and anthem-sized production values. The mercurial \\"I Walk Alone,\\" one of two tracks co-penned by Pink, is tailored to Cher with its themes of independence and coming-of-age.<br /><br />The ballads, surprisingly, are what work best of all. Cher seemingly weaves gold from the rather formulaic \\"I Hope You Find It,\\" actually a Miley Cyrus cover, meaning it's finally getting sung by proper pipes. Though the emotions run a little treacly and the production, as on most of the album, is too heavy-handed, the results stand up because of Cher's bold vocals and investment in the lyrical content. Time has simply not weathered her instrument.<br /><br />\\"Sirens\\" is certainly the album's most valuable moment. Her earnest, precise execution of the soul-bearing lyrics affords the listener a look into her remarkably large heart. She sounds both vulnerable and dazzling - a better rendering of the song does not seem possible.<br /><br />It was a long, long time in coming, but \\"Closer to the Truth\\" is finally here, and it's a definite pleasure.

It is the kind of song that might have been compromised by the loud, overproduced atmosphere of albums like \\"The Big Picture\\" or 1992's otherwise powerful \\"The One.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart,\\" John sings with uncommon passion before diving into a brazen, enchanting solo, the likes of which longtime listeners associate with albums such as \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\\"<br /><br />Furthermore, \\"The Diving Board\\" is anchored by three instrumental solos that, quite predictably, are marvelous and attention-seizing. The third of these, \\"Dream No. 3,\\" is easily one of the best moments of John's career, winding down into the loungey, bluesy title track.<br /><br />One unique trait of Sir Elton's is that his compound professionalism and genius as a musician has never eluded him, not even in periods where his life was at a particularly low ebb. The result is that he has never crafted an album without something wortwhile resulting - those mid-80s LPs may have had filler, but the gems, once found, were unquestionable. Similar can be said here, only this time the highlights are less radio-friendly, yet more plentiful and with more weight and substance, and now instead of personal demons creeping into the music he has two lovely young boys and a happy, healthy marriage which mean even more to him than his career. That comfortability waves in some less than compelling moments into \\"The Diving Board\\" but is also its asset - relieved of the burden to find a hit single or cater to the casual listener, John presents himself with a take-it-or-leave-it attitude, making the gambles really count and giving the highlights extra grist.<br /><br />One does hope, however, that he will return to the atittude of 2001's \\"Songs from the West Coast.\\" Though more reined in than \\"The Diving Board,\\" it proved he could go back to the template of his classic albums without sacrificing those instantly memorable melodic hooks.<br /><br />(A 21-track deluxe edition featuring two exclusive tracks is available only at Target.)t more plentiful and with more weight and substance, and now instead of personal demons creeping into the music he has two lovely young boys and a happy, healthy marriage which mean even more to him than his career.

B00DJYKFXG|4.0|I bought this because I wanted the DVD Audio, the video clips, and the complete soundboard of the New Year's Eve show.<br /><br />I knew before I preordered it in August that it was DVD audio and not a DVD of the show, save for the two clips. It was made pretty clear, at least in my eyes, in every article I read about the set, including this site. Do your HW before buying so you know what you're getting!<br /><br />That aside, the first two discs (essentially the original Rock of Ages, save for a different order and extra unreleased track) sound INCREDIBLE on the reissue. Everything is so much clearer. The vocals cut right through the mix, and the drums don't sound as muddled as they used to. Everything is just crisp and tight and clear and it's definitely worth getting even the 2 disc version if you don't spring for the box set. I'm noticing aspects of songs that I just plain could not hear on older Rock of Ages releases.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to listen to the DVD audio yet, but I am looking forward to doing so as I am sure it will be a good listen. I did watch the video clips though, and they are a cool find, fun watching the boys do their thing. I, like most people, wish the entire show was available and part of the set, but it's not, and I knew that before I bought it.<br /><br />The soundboard recording is neat too, listening to some banter in between songs and whatnot. Has a little bit of a different feel than the first 2 discs, not as polished, but that's what they were going for from what I've read. Still sounds fantastic.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a serious fan, get it, regardless of the fact that the DVD is DVD audio and not the concert, it's a good investment. The Sound quality on the first 2 discs is outstanding, the soundboard recording sounds great, and the DVD audio will sound great as well I'm sure. The video clips are a bonus.

B00DJZR46G|5.0|The narrative around Elton John's new album \\"Diving Board\\" is about a return to a stripped down, sparse piano and lyric-driven sensibility of his early days. Go back to 2001 and the same claims were also being made for the excellent \\"Songs from the West Coast\\". But on this album Elton John has again enlisted the producing \\"gun for hire\\" T Bone Burnett, fresh from work with Diana Krall, Steve Earle, Gregg Allman and of course rekindling the link with Elton forged on 2011's \\"The Union\\".<br /><br />The Burnett and John link up adds new dimensions not least with Bernie Taupin firing on all lyrical cylinders and the producer essentially dismissing band support. The result is that \\"The Diving Board\\" is a fine album recalling the wonders of the early Elton which got lost over the years in \\"Tantrums and Tiaras\\". So it back to a proper emphasis on songs and all the better for it. Opener \\"Oceans Away\\" sets the tone with Elton singing better than ever as and where he opens with the confession that \\"I hung out with the old folks/ in the hope that I'd get wise/I was trying to bridge the gap, between the great divide\\". Other great songs follow not least the haunting \\"Town called jubilee\\" and the brilliant standout \\"My Quicksand\\" which is one of the better songs he has written in years. The album is punctuated with 3 \\"Dream\\" piano interludes and the sumptuous third of these is also Keith Jarrett like in composition.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Can I stay alone tonight\\" hark back to that vintage era of \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\" as does the splendid \\"Take This Dirty Water\\" where Elton sings sagely \\"If you break some bones on landing/ You'll know you're built to last\\". It is three of the darker songs here however which impress most. \\"Oscar Wilde gets out\\" charting the writers sad departure to France post Reading Jail is an automatic start for downloads. The \\"New Fever Waltz\\" would not go amiss on a Tom Waits album while the highly reflective almost Randy Newman style song \\"Home Again\\" is pure class.<br /><br />\\"The Diving Board\\" is a master class in song writing and sees Elton John at his most intimate and introspective. Perhaps it is not sardine packed with obvious hits but taken as a whole it is his most solid and worthwhile album in a decade. The old Rocket Man has got back into groove, and achieved lift off. Part of this stems from the fact that he is clearly enjoying himself greatly not least on the evidence of \\"Mexican Vacation (Kids in Candlelight)\\" and the excellent bluesy title track. This reviewer would not claim to be a fully paid up member of the Elton John fan club but this is one record of his that you really need.re class.<br /><br />\\"The Diving Board\\" is a master class in song writing and sees Elton John at his most intimate and introspective.

B00E9PMMX0|1.0|As much as I love the original Star Wars trilogy, I absolutely refuse to buy Star Wars on Blu Ray until the original unaltered theatrical versions are included.  I don't even care if the altered versions are the main features on the discs, but just as long as there is a special feature or some way to watch the original theatrical versions.  It appears George Lucas ignored the large majority of his fans who share my preference, but hopefully Disney or someone in charge will read this, and for once, listen to fans (who are willing and able to pay consumers, might I add).
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />When looking at a film like Mud it's hard to picture Matthew McConaughey being fit to play the titular character. Sure, he's had a handful of serious roles in the past, but majority of his work consists of Rom-Coms and things of that nature. However, it's this odd casting choice that makes Mud such a surprise hit. Not only is McConaughey able to pull of this role, but he does it with such ease that you would think he gets offered roles like this all the time. With that said, though, Mud is such a unique film that even McConaughey's stellar performance feels like a minor element in a much bigger picture.<br /><br />There's no denying that Mud's title and marketing are a bit misleading. While the story does center around the titular Mud, he isn't necessarily the main character of the film. No, that titled is reserved for a young boy named Ellis (Tye Sheridan). Living in De Witt, Arkansas with his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), the two boys come across a presumably deserted island while riding their boat one morning. However, it doesn't take long before they come across a man named Mud. After sharing his story with the boys, they learn that he is trying to reunite with his childhood sweetheart Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), but is on the run from some bounty hunters and needs their help.<br /><br />One of Mud's strongest attributes is its cast and their performances, but the story's purity and unpredictability are what really connected with me. Because of this, there's no way to gain a real understanding of the story based on the brief synopsis provided above or on the back of the box. At its core, Mud is about a young boy's crippled understanding of love. Ellis believes that if two people love each other then they should be together, but everywhere he turns another relationship is crumbling. Whether its his parents marriage, the complicated relationship between Mud and Juniper, or his horrible experience with his first \\"girlfriend\\", Ellis' faith in true love slowly deteriorates as the film progresses and its almost heartbreaking to watch.<br /><br />As a result, Mud's character progression makes itself known throughout the entirety of the film. Not only from Ellis, but from Mud as well. By the time you reach the story's conclusion you see drastic change in both of these characters and its arguably the result of them meeting each other. Ellis is no longer the naive boy blindly living in an imperfect world and Mud is finally able to move on and do the right thing for both himself and those around him. The viewer also sees a slight change in both Neckbone and Senior (Ray McKinnon), Ellis' father, but their growth isn't as apparent as the two leads.<br /><br />Mud's casting is something that's been praised quite a bit by those who have seen the film, and for good reason. Not only were the actors perfect for their roles, but everyone involved did a phenomenal job of bringing these characters to life. Sheridan and McConaughey are bound to leave the biggest impression due to them receiving the most screen time, but it would be wrong to ignore the fact that Witherspoon, Lofland, McKinnon and Sam Shepard all delivered outstanding performances as well. While I would have liked to see more emphasis put on some of the characters like Juniper and Tom, it's no small feat that even the minor performances stood out as much as they did.<br /><br />Finally, the film's sense of atmosphere is outstanding. Part of this is brought out by the cast's performances, but it's also accomplished through the film's score, composed by David Wingo. Both of these elements combined really help bring to life the gritty southern setting. David's compositions are dark, ominous, and, at times, even a little thrilling. They're a perfect fit for the story being told and without them there's no arguing that the film wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - Among other things, Mud is powerful and confident. The story is engaging, the setting is raw, and it's all tied together with some fantastic performances and an equally enjoyable score. However, all of these things are just small parts of a greater whole and that's what helps make Mud feel like a cohesive experience. If you had your eye on this before I definitely recommend you give it your time. It easily exceeded my expectations.

B002ZG980U|4.0|Dream vs. Reality<br />Dreaming just isn't the same anymore after entering the world of \\"Inception.\\"  Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, this dream like science-fiction thriller becomes a thought provoking film that will excite any dreamer's mind.  It all becomes possible through the Oscar winning performances, direction, and mind bending illusions in production. Chances are you will have to return for a second run through to grasp the reality of this blockbuster.<br /><br />The life of a professional \\"extractor isn't an easy one, especially for Dominick Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), whose job with the help of advance technology, is to attack the minds of their sleeping targets to extract valuable information.  Each time Dom invades someone's subconscious it seems to take a piece out of him. As Dom's story unfolds you begin to see the pain that he goes through, from the loss of his wife, to the torment of never seeing his kids again.  DiCaprio plays the role with excellence by showing that internal conflict.  That moment is shown when we repeatedly see his two little kids playing in the grass and then running off-screen, without looking back at him and is put into a context, and we realize what that memory is for him. Alongside DiCaprio comes the wisecracking comic relief from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy as the specialist in the team as well as Ellen Page who plays the role of the architect who creates the environments in which the dreams take place.<br /><br />At some point you have to wonder what was going through Christopher Nolan's mind when he brought forth the idea of \\"Inception.\\"  Nolan simply wanted to create a movie that allowed the audience to experience the reality of dreams.  The complexity of the film doesn't really begin until the multi-layered plot comes into play.  The \\"dream with a dream\\" idea shows that Nolan still has the creativity that moviegoers want.  Nolan's plan was to have Cobb complete one final job to plant an idea into someone's mind rather than to take it in order to get home to his children. That is the idea of Inception, and was carefully thought out from an award winning director.  From \\"Batman Begins\\" to \\"The Dark Knight\\", Nolan sets to intrigue the audience with another adventurous film.<br /><br />Many will find the movie confusing due to the multi-layered stories that are interlinked.  The production will have moviegoers will have more than an ordinary attention to the film and initially wanted them to keep guessing to have multiple screenings.  With ten years in the making, \\"Inception\\" gave everyone their own realm of dreams and new ideas for creativity.<br /><br />As I replay the movie in my head trying to grasp of what just happened, the producers got what they wanted.  The ending has us wondering over and over if it was dream or reality, and if it only took one screening to figure it out, bravo to you. The aim of the movie was simple, to create a new world inside one that we each have created when we fall asleep.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This is a movie for all time. Everyone needs to see \\"Schindler's List\\" to get a glimpse at what really happened during the Holocaust. Oscar Schindler was so moved by the heroic and stoic Jews, that his heart and soul completely turned around. He helped save the lives of so many while risking his own exposure of his compassion to the Nazis. My son was born on the day that Oscar Schindler died. I believe that it was no coincidence, as my son is a person of great compassion and unselfishness along with strength of character. Thank you Steven Spielberg.
B0027MJU00|1.0|The more I read of this book, the more I disliked it - finally stopping about 60% of the way through.  There was simply no one to root for; each character was more off-putting than the others.  I'll go out of my way to avoid any further Flynn books.
B00DRGQZRG|5.0|In spite of the hype, this is not a fusion album. The days of swirling organs, acid-inflected screaming guitars, and blustery drums mixed with exotic substances, inner enlightenment, and science fiction crossovers are dead and gone. Please listen to this album as simply a 2013 electric jazz set.<br /><br />The fusion rumors surfaced when people noticed that for the first time in decades, a Dave Holland-led album did not feature any trumpets, saxes, or trombones, nor was it a big band album. While there are references to past ensembles and recordings (such as Holland's 1990 Extensions album, or Eubanks' 1992 Turning Point album), Prism is something radically different and new, and at 70:07 will repay many years of listening.<br /><br />With Craig Taborn on piano and Fender Rhodes, Kevin Eubanks on guitars, and Eric Harland on drums, there is plenty of soloing for everyone, yet no one dominates. Wait until you hear Eubanks' twisted, distorted lines on \\"The Watcher\\", the Leslie-cabinet effect on \\"Choir\\", the Gibson hollow-body sound on the spooky \\"The Color of Iris\\", and the Wah-Wah pedal on \\"Breathe\\". More than just a non-stop soloist, he often doubles the melody lines with Taborn. Eric Harland is quite simply amazing, especially in a rimshot solo at the end of \\"Evolution\\". Taborn is the \\"most free\\" of this incomparable quartet: the quirky stops and starts of \\"Spirals\\" and the towering solos he plays on \\"The True Meaning of Determination\\" and \\"Evolution\\" are awe-inspiring.<br /><br />And what of Holland himself? As always, he's the bedrock beneath the terra firma. His all-too-rare solos sound so effortless that they almost defer attention. In spite of throwing jabs like a heavyweight champ, the listener can almost take his lines for granted, so cohesively do they mesh into the musical fabric. And while no one would compare this album to 1978's all-solo Emerald Tears, his dexterity, innovation, and virtuosity have not suffered after almost 50 years of recorded performances. For all those interested in the players involved, this purchase is what is colloquially known as a \\"no-brainer\\".

B00CL0J99K|3.0|Remember how refreshing the first IRON MAN was?  It was fun, witty, fast-paced, with solid acting and an undeniably charismatic lead in Robert Downey Jr.  Then we got all hopped up for IRON MAN 2, and we were...underwhelmed.  In fact, to this day, only two things about the sequel stick with me: the absence of Terrence Howard, and that amazing scene between Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke in the prison cell, where you leave two great actors alone in a room together and see what happens.  Everything else is a mediocre, \\"oh what might have been\\" blur.<br /><br />IRON MAN 3 walks the line between those two films, not as great as the first, not as utterly forgettable as the second.  It's plot is pretty great on the surface: a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is targeting America, using technology so advanced that no one can put their hands on it.  Enter Tony Stark (Downey Jr.), aka Iron Man, aka \\"don't mess with my friends.\\"  Well, the Mandarin does just that, and suddenly Tony finds himself in a (somewhat) morally complex spiral through terrorism, bureaucracy, and good old fashioned revenge.<br /><br />The film, from director Shane Black (who directed Downey in the grossly underrated KISS KISS BANG BANG), takes a few interesting twists and turns.  This will probably have fanboys wringing their fists (and pounding their keyboards) in frustration.  In part, they're right to do so; the film, like the second, wastes a lot of its potential with a third-act twist that (let's face it) is rather predictable.  BUT, unlike the second film, it at least tries to do something else.  I won't say what, but it's nice to see a blockbuster shy away from conventional expectations.  That being said...it IS still a letdown, albeit one boasted by some great performances (Kingsley in particular, but Guy Pearce has a few good moments as well, and James Badge Dale has some nice scenes).  Rebecca Hall gets little to do, but she does it well; same with returning stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, and Jon Favreau.<br /><br />Ultimately, how you feel about IRON MAN 3 will come down to your expectations going into it.  If you keep your expectations realistic (remember: IRON MAN 2), then you may be pleasantly surprised...unless you're fiercely loyal to the source material, in which case you're gonna be disappointed.  IRON MAN 3 isn't the film it could have been, but that's actually a two-way street: it could have been better, but could have been much worse.  Take that for what you will, but at least it's another chance for Robert Downey Jr. to quip some one-liners and give the cameras a mischievous glare.Don Cheadle, and Jon Favreau.<br /><br />Ultimately, how you feel about IRON MAN 3 will come down to your expectations going into it.

B008H7HE9S|4.0|I'd heard the &#34;un-clean&#34; version of this first and while I liked the CD, I felt the profane lyrics were unnecessary. I was very pleased to learn that I could get a more sanitized version. Neither the musical quality or the listening pleasure has been reduced, and I don't have to worry who overhears the songs. If you like Maroon 5, you'll really like this CD.

1476727651|4.0|The return-to-form King displayed with 11/22/63 and the novella JOYLAND continues for the most part with King's long-awaited 36-years-later sequel to 1977's THE SHINING.  Picking up only a few years after the conclusion of events in THE SHINING, the prologue features one of the most memorable apparitions from The Overlook making a welcome return &#34;haunting&#34;. From there, the novel jumps ahead a couple of decades, picking up with Danny at his lowest point in his late twenties before coursing ahead several more years. The pacing is a little disjointed at times and I was disappointed that some of Dan's arguably more compelling years (his teenage years) - and characters such as Wendy and Dick Hallorann - are never really explored to the extent or depth I had hoped they would be. A little more detail and padding here would have been welcome. However, King has often been criticized for his meandering, overlong style so many readers may relish this slightly more concise style.  The constant references throughout to even minor events in THE SHINING will have most readers inevitably comparing it to the earlier book (throwbacks to &#34;REDRUM&#34; and many other references abound). While DOCTOR SLEEP does work as a stand-alone novel, it works best as a sequel. There are two main threads to this novel: the exploration and expansion of the character of the now adult 'Doc', as he battles with his demons (alcoholism, his past, and his shining ability); and the new story and characters such as Abra, Chetta, Lucy, Doctor John, Dave, and The True Knot. The new characters, especially Abra, are well drawn but the villains come across as a little hammy and the overall plot pales in comparison to Dan's inner ruminations.  The book's strongest point is the characterization of the original character and his expansion, with the main plot (new characters, new villains) being somewhat weaker but serviceable. As is typical with many King novels, the ending is a bit of a letdown - (smallspoiler) it's not bad but it is a little predictable and the final showdown is rushed with its infamous Colorado setting underused.  King says that this novel is a &#34;return to balls-to-the-wall, keep-the-lights-on scary horror&#34; and eerie early scenes in the prologue and when Dan's Shining returns with a bang in Teenytown seem to promise this, but it never really manifests, and overall the novel is not at all scary or even particularly creepy. Unfortunately, while it is suspenseful, much of the tale is just not as compelling or terrifying as it could have been. It's more of a supernatural adventure than a horror - an enjoyable and entertaining adventure for the most part that also serves as a poignant story of redemption, exploring themes such as mortality, family, and second chances.  Due to high expectations, you may be disappointed - don't expect a direct sequel to THE SHINING, but view it more as a continuation of the character of Dan with a new story and lots of references to the original novel. Don't expect a horror novel either - view this as more of a supernatural adventure crossed with a poignant story of redemption. It's far from perfect (few sequels are) and it's not better than the original, but it does continue the tale of Dan Torrance in an effective and heartfelt manner, features a good (though not great) premise, and introduces some interesting new characters, while also being respectful of and paying homage to its roots. Despite its flaws, DOCTOR SLEEP is a solid work.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Elton John is going one more time back to the basics. His piano playing is fantastic, his voice fits perfectly the lyrics and music! I cannot understand why he is only playing his hits on his concerts as he has created some great albums within the last 12 years, especially \\"Songs from the West Coast\\", \\"The Captain and the Kid\\" and, now, \\"The Diving Board\\". His latest album needs several listenings before one regards it as a real classic, which it certainly is! To me, \\"The Diving Board\\" is one of his three best albums ever! Give it a try!

B004LWZW24|3.0|There was too little normal moments in film.  It would probably drive a child over the edge whereby they could not sleep or be alone for a very long time. It makes me think that person who made the movie is a raving mad lunatic. It is like being stuck in house of horrors. It is being sent to troops in Afghanistan to hopefully enjoy!

1603580557|5.0|This is a wonderful book! The ideas are so clearly explained, and their flow is so smooth, it really is a pleasure to read it. I knew of systems theory before, and often feared its complexity, but Dona Meadows's examples, graphs and explanations makes it so easy to grasp. Indeed systems are everywhere around us (and within us for that matter...), and to understand them requires a simple understanding of the fact that the components of a system are not necessarily the ones that are changing it, but rather the inter-relations among them and, most importantly, the purpose of the system. Explaining the book further would mean pasting it here, because there is no other simpler way to talk about systems as in this book. Highly recommend it!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|An awesome movie if you like period dramas like Pride & Prejudice! The novel &#34;North & South&#34; by Elizabeth Gaskell is great too if you like those kinds of books!

Well, there's nobody to call! I can't get this thing to work and google has no customer support that I can call for help. Waste of money, will try to return item.
B00DYWKPAQ|4.0|King of leon are one of the more distinctive bands to come up in the past 10 years. Starting off their career with the raunchy and garagey, and energetic Youth and Young Manhood and have gradually matured their sound. Losing some fans along the way, and gaining tons of others. They reached the pinnacle of their success with the worldwide hit \\"Sex on Fire\\". Which was in itself a very polarizing song for longtime fans. Their characteristically quirky and spastic sound cooled down even more in 2010's Come Around Sundown, showcasing an expansive and mid-tempo style that was pleasant but failed to impress.<br /><br />Their brand new album Mechanical Bull, seems to be taking more queues from the latest two albums rather than their earlier garage sound. I'm sure fans of the early KoL who still haven't given up will give this a listen and will, yet again, be disappointed. The group seems unapoloteic about their new polished and radio-friendly direction. But if you have come to this album with open ears and few preconceived ideas you are bound to find a great rock'n'roll album, well-balanced in ballads, rock anthems, and quirky garage-influenced tracks.<br /><br />Mechanical Bull will not rake in any new fans who haven't gotten on board since Sex on Fire blew up on the radiowaves, yet, it will provide with sufficient ear candy for mainstream music apprecioators and unprejudicial rock fans. If you are still searching for the lo-fi and hard-punching Kings I'm afraid to inform you those days are well behind them.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|nicely done mix of &#34;28 Days Later&#34; (in which the Zombies are FAST! rather than slow and stumbling) and &#34;Contagion&#34; in which the thrills and drama center around the race to find a cure.  it's not Brad Pitt's fault that he's tabloid magazine movie star fodder - he delivers another credible performance in this one, and the rest of the cast is up to the challenge.  a few slightly silly moments (you really didn't think to turn off your cell phone?) but overall a worthwhile couple of hours of excitement.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Darlene's new album is GREAT! She was able to record a great sound, upbeat music and very moving lyrics that take you right into the presence of God!!! After listening to this cd, I find myself singing parts of it as I go through my day and one morning, even woke up singing a song from it! It is refreshing and I believe one of her best works!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|It has an interesting, thought provoking premise.  I appreciated the historical research.  The consequences of the main character's history changing action seemed illogical.  The love story sub-plot ended nicely.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I wish this book had been assigned reading in high school (instead of the dull textbooks we had to read). This book (and book 1) gives you such an 'inside' perspective not just on what happened during WW1 and 2, but what it must have felt like to go through those wars--and not just from an American or British perspective, but from a German an Russian perspective as well. Very very engaging. Thank you Ken Follett. Can't wait for the last installment in the series.

I thought Sarum was great and really like Rutherfurd's style.

B00E89VXQY|5.0|I recently bought Metallica: Through The Never soundtrack and i must say that the first thing that came in my mind was the great sound that this cd have.<br />And the famous question is &iquest;Why i should buy a cd with songs that i heard a millions times. Here are the reasons:<br /><br />1) As i already said, the sound is amazing! well mixed, mastering, re mastering, etc. It's almost like you were there (i've been a few times and the CD is very close to the sound that the band has live.) Always rock/hard/heavy/metal/etc. bands have very bad or poor sound recordings on their live albums (almost all the bands). This is by far one of the best live metal recordings ever made.<br /><br />2) The band is in very good shape, especially james. In the past few years he is getting his voice back, and even Lars is playing great the drums again (since 2012<br /><br />3) The item is cheap now that they have their own label.<br /><br />Special attention to Creeping Death, The memory remains, Cyanide, MOP and Orion which are the really high points of the cd (the most well played songs)

B001EBWING|5.0|Not too often in recent days that Hollywood can produce something without sex, violence or taking God's name in vain. These older films have much to commend them, albeit not perfect (such as smoking & drinking). Anyway, good acting and a happy ending. There were some things in &#34;the good old days&#34; that had much to commend them over what we have today!
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I am not a zombie movie fan, but I did like this one and the story line was very good. The special effects were great and the zombies were menacing. Because of the violence and intense nature of the story I would not recommend that young children watch this flick unless you want them to have nightmares for weeks on end. It is very entertaining and suspenseful and I do recommend giving it a look. It's the first zombie movie I ever bought and believe me, I never buy these kinds of movies, but this one is worth it. Enjoy it without the kids.

B00D1QBQ2G|5.0|This album's subject matter is about the first, most scandalous pop culture star of the Italian settecento. The print media described Caffarelli as vicious as Farinelli was virtuous. He had an infectious personality that ignited scuffles, duels, and angry husbands on his hunt for blood. His histrionics on and off the stage went as far as heckling, mocking, and disrupting his fellow singers while on scene. He was boastful about his earnings, and emphasized how much more money he made than anyone else.  Though some critics and composers declared him superior to Farinelli, in the final analysis, Caffarelli did not go down into posterity as the best singer. He was persistent to alienate those who influence judgment about him at the peak of his career.<br /><br />To speak of this album, a word or two also needs to be said about Franco, the artist and the singer.<br /><br />As the singer, he has a before and after delineated by his 2012 Leonardo Vinci's Arbace.<br /><br />His before as a countertenor is relatively obscure, and frankly it does not matter quite more. Since Vo Solcando, he climbed to prominence and now flies high. Comparison between him and the other countertenors cannot be ignored as either he set himself apart as a mezzo or just raised the bar a lot higher for other countertenors. For now, he is in a league of his own.<br /><br />While most other artists are waging the grand battle of Son Qual Naves among themselves, it is refreshing Franco obliged to suppress it because, well, this is a Caffarelli tribute after all. It is also welcome that worn-out repertoire like Ombra mai fu and Scherza infida were clich&eacute;d out...and by the way, Son qual nave is a great aria which has become de rigueur just like lawyers having to pass the BAR exam to start practicing.<br /><br />The album's melancholic arias are sublime, and impossible for a foul creature, like Cafarelli was painted, to have inspired such finesse of the soul. Go figure. Franco sings these largos in almost a transcendental, timeless pathos with all nuance of nostalgia. Some scores could have the uncanny factor of period museum pieces; however, Franco interprets them in a form that grips attention and excitement. The result is worth his effort and risk taken here.<br /><br />As the artist, Franco creates a well conceptualized vocal portrait of Caffarelli. The collection of arias is cohesive yet with enough diversity in the vocal line to showcase the style and skills that Caffarelli could have been known for. The album's mix of new with known music shows great taste, and forethought to please the fans, not just the academic cognescenti. The orchestration of the arias de agilita share common elements in the use of horns and timpani, instruments reserved for the role of God or gods by baroque convention. Since these Caffarelli roles were neither, it is plausible that he imposed these musical requirements to please his own sense of grandiosity. This album is the best retrospective of a castrato made to date.<br /><br />With the opening aria, Fra l'orror della tempesta, Franco pays the price of admission as a baroque singer with his masterful execution of the vocal runs. They are furious, completed in one single breath, and adorned with double trills, martellos, and ringing tones which are now his signature. The melismatic movements ending in \\"tempesta\\" are inflected to sound like the strong gusts of a storm while the ones ending in \\"scintillar\\" have a brighter and more acute tone foretelling a glimmer of hope in the eye of the storm. The remaining lyrics are strung together in rapid staccato that flows with the fast unrelenting continuo that turns this entire aria into an instrumental allegro di molto.<br /><br />The promotional video on YouTube appears to be a little light-hearted showing Franco mentoring his own orchestra director. Humor aside, their timing is mercurial in coupling horn fortissimos with martellos to produce the effect of two vocal bombas in Fral'orror, and in highlighting Franco's ringing tones with sudden pops of violin obligato.<br /><br />Considering the complexity of this repertoire, and the skill used to hone its past glory, one can reasonably think that Franco is unto something very special when vocal painting the castrato artistry. His re-creation is credible. He made art. I dig it, and look forward to more.of violin obligato.

B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I will begin this post by discussing the characters. I thought that the characters in this book were really well done. Since it takes place in the late 1980's, I can't really relate to the times, but the other parts of being a teenager felt very fresh and real. One thing that I really liked is that not only were the main characters well written, but the others were too. Often minor characters feel less fleshed out and real, but that was not the case with this book.<br /><br />The writing was good. It was a fast read, and I enjoyed the writing. The one criticism I have on this topic is that the POV (point of view) switched back and forth between Eleanor and Park a lot, which is a useful (from a story telling prospective) but over used (from a reading prospective) story telling method.<br /><br />And last is the plot. I really enjoyed it, mostly because I felt like there were many levels of plot there, and they all felt important. There is the main story line between the two title characters, and then they each have at least one of two plot lines of their own: with peers, siblings, parents, ect. I also liked how real the plot felt. Many books involving teen romance do not feel real, but this one did. I felt like this could happen to me all the way through.<br /><br />Over all, I really enjoyed this book, and I highly recommend it. While it is a romance in many ways (though certainly not a traditional teen romance novel), you might very well still like it even if you usually don't like romance.

B00FN2KR2G|5.0|Being a true son of the South and a frequent visitor to Savannah, I can say that Mr. Whitehead captures the warp and weave of a culture determined to cling to a bygone culture with the same tenacity that Spanish Moss clings to the city's ancient live oaks. The Gordonston Ladies who are the pivotal characters could easily have been one of my aunts. Whitehead's descriptions of them are so dead-on accurate that you find yourself cringing at times - at least I did. It is not surprising that the ladies are right in the center of all the little mysteries that are spinning out of control. The story drips with dark humor tastier than a mint julep.  Sit back with your favorite adult beverage and enjoy.

I think the next trilogy should be fifty shades of Christian, cause we call know the inner monologue of Ana but I would like to know what was going through his mind. Read the story from Christian`s point of a view.

If you have an HDTV with HDMI jack, wi-fi, and an ordinary Win7 or newer netbook/laptop or equiv you are ready to go in 5 min from opening the package. All you do is install and use the Chrome browser and cast the active tab (with Netflix, YouTube, or whatever) to your TV. Great quality. It just eliminates the need for a cable to your TV. There are lots of other tips from reviewers here on ways to stream other audio and video. For $35 it is such a bargain. I cannot understand those who are gripping about it, but I guess there are always some of those. Get it and enjoy.

B008XZKSKG|1.0|Wow, wow, wow.  I am disappointed in so many ways. First off Genesis and their songwriting is 5-Stars.  This 1-Star applies to the quality of the remixing and vinyl.<br /><br />Where to begin.  For reference, I have attempted to listen to this on an audiophile-lite system consisting of Pro-Ject Carbon, Upgraded Acrylic platter and puck, Ortofon 2M, Marantz PM-8004 (in Source Direct Mode), B&W speakers, and Beyerdynamic DT770Pro headphones for baseline comparisons.  A modest system.<br /><br />1.  Trick of the Tale. Vinyl was actually \\"warped\\" a bit too much for the price.  And then there is the awful compression-loudmix.<br />For comparison sake, I pulled out an \\"average\\" ATCO LP from 1976 in my collection of Trick.  The original ATCO version I had from 1976 CRUSHED the new mix.  The dynamic range was a thing of beauty on the old version.  The drums & bass levels sound distorted on the new mixes.  (I will NOT listen to this new mix compared to my 76 copy. On visual inspection of 76' ATCO copy vs New copy, the grooves in the ATCO where there is more Bass/Drums or quite parts is noticeably better defined.<br /><br />2.  Wind and Wuthering. I decided to start with 'All in a Mouse's Night' on side 2.  DEFECTIVE!!! Seriously, it does not look the vinyl was cut deep enough, and I heard total drop outs and harsh static at points.  (STOPPED RIGHT THERE.)  (This is going back!) Tempting fate I flipped to Side 1, and played 'One for the Vine\\", again awful loud and compressed sounding.<br /><br />3.  Three.  'Follow you, Follow me' Vocals punch through nicely, but when Phil hits his Timpani it sounds a bit distorted and the Bass really dominates. 'Scenes from a Nights Dream' - Nice mix, vocals really come thru.  'Down and Out' is vibrant, drums sound amazing.  Overall, I could live with this copy. For new vinyl it does have a bit of surface noise.<br /><br />4.  Duke. ~Passable~... For comparison I pulled out my Atlantic Labeled version of Duke from 1980 that is VG+ condition.'Turn it on Again' was bright, but again a little hot sounding.  'Guide Vocal' - How do you screw up Vocal's & Piano?  Well, Phil's voice comes through beautifully clear but Bank's piano is now lost behind Phil's voice.  I prefer the orginal 1980 mix, where Phil & Tony are more or less equal and balanced.  Now here is an ODD one.  Visually, 'Man of our Times' looks completely different based on the grooves.  'Man of our Times' actually sounded pretty good on the new release!  'Duke's Travels' again a bit hot, but passable.<br /><br />5.  Abacab.  Well the mix of 'Abacab' was pretty good actually. Side 1 was actually enjoyable to listen to.  Side 2. 'Dodo' a bit too hot, but ok.  However, the vinyl itself had some bad surface noise at times.  (It may need a few play thru's if you subscribe to the MOFI 'break in' period)<br /><br />So to recap. Trick and Wind are simply NOT listenable when compared to my original vinyl.  Trick was warped, and Wind had pressing/cutting issues on side 2.  Duke is passable and Abacab and Three could be consider keepers -vs- old worn out vinyl.<br /><br />Part of me wonders if these vinyl recordings didn't go from Analog to Digital to Analog instead of true Analog from start to finish.  That would explain alot.  We need the old \\"CD Grading\\" system back for 'modern' vinyl releases.  Remember AAD, ADD, DDD on CD's? :-)
B00EDPFJA4|2.0|the thing about  Drake is that the songs aren't wack, its that he is more of a Singer than a MC to me and alot of his material has a formula that works well in both worlds and this album to me feels more like a part 2 of the last album, in style, theme and vibe.  Drake though has a sleepy time quality that allows him to almost croon and get over. he is  a catchy cat and that works more for him as to substance. he is one of those  cats where timing truly works in his favor, in any other era he would be  seen as a marginal act,however now he gets over alot more. i still feel he is at best hit and miss on  a  average tip.

B00D2I8E46|2.0|got a chance recently to sit and hear this album between Costello and the  Roots and the sentiment was  some things are either best left to just doing them on  the  tv show or best left to the cutting room floor period.  no songwriting here that goes anywhere and it just feels and sounds like  a jam session flipped to sell a project and who benefits from it exactly? Elvis Costello to me was always a 2nd tier act at best who was more important to the critics, i could take or leave him The  Roots to me are more famous and known for playing behind other folks and to me they stay as the bridesmaids with their own music and i'm still waiting on them to make a Artistic statement to merit  the hype. this ain't it.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I liked this book, but for someone who has seen the movie a million times and being one of my most beloved movies. I was disappointed in how differently the book is from the movie. Good book despite my misunderstanding of Hollywood's creative liberties with the movie script. :)
B009RX8MQ0|3.0|i dig this show and  i keep up with it.  however this season was hit and miss.  too much going on and it lacked focus and it needed to cut to the chase a little quicker in some respects, still i'm looking forward to what happens next. i  just hope it don't get watered down and loses the edge it had early on.
0763644765|4.0|We haven't used this book a ton yet, but it is cute.  The last page is a little creepy with the only word being &#34;underwear&#34; and lots of pictures of underwear.  We'll see if it's aw-inspiring for my toddler!
B001BANK32|5.0|Second time reading this book and I enjoyed it even more than before!  Boggles the  mind...twisting, turning, never seeing the end coming quite like it does!  Mr King, you are the master!  Now, on to Doctor Sleep...

B00CL0J99K|4.0|I'm on my third copy and it will not play on my playstation 3.  I've checked my PS3 with other movies, works fine.  Just a heads up, this is a review on the product only... not the movie itself, which is awesome.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I had to go into settings and change the bluray internet settings from automatic to confirm.  It plays now.

B00E6890VC|5.0|Probably the most anticipated debut album since \\"Manners\\" from Passion Pit, Glasgow band CHVRCHES (pronounced Churches) has finally released \\"Bones of What You Believe\\" to the masses! CHVRCHES has already made four singles available to the public, but how does the rest of the album stand up? Pretty well to be honest.<br /><br />After a couple of listens, what stands out the most is Lauren Mayberry's beautifully sonic and wide ranging vocals. Some bands have lead singers that tend to clash with the instrumentation; not in this case though as Lauren's voice thankfully compliments everything that plays in the background. Synths pulse and pop from the get-go up until the final gorgeous ballad of \\"You Caught the Light\\". It is a very infectious tune and it is obvious that the band took a lot of inspiration from 80's music of yesteryear.<br /><br />\\"Gun\\" is their catchiest song and the entire track has that addictive 80's vibe that is difficult to mistake. \\"Tether\\" is an ambitious slow paced piece (at least compared to the rest of the album) that has a stellar two minute finale as synths blare in the background and Lauren's vocals become intertwined with the music. \\"Lungs\\", with it's teenage sugary sweetness, is another brilliant melodious track that sounds like it would be meant for a high school play, and \\"You Caught the Light\\" is a fantastic slow-moving closing song that ties up everything nicely with optimism and joy.<br /><br />Though the synths and vocals are memorable, the actual lyrical content is the weakest part of the album and a tad simplistic for my liking. There are dark themes of broken relationships, abuse and acts of revenge, but nothing that delves too deep into the subconscious. Perhaps the band was attempting to do what Foster the People did in \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" and combine ominous lyrics with a catchy distracting beat. To be honest though, CHVRCHES is not quite as successful in accomplishing this feat. It is also worth mentioning that the band can be explicit sometimes as Lauren throws the f-word once into every other song. It does not go against the music, and is fairly sporadic, but it is there in case you are worried about swearing.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Bones of What You Believe\\" is a fantastic debut album by new players CHVRCHES. As noted before, the lyrics are not as deep as something you would find from Passion Pit or Foster the People, but the music is infectious and catchy! It is simple but effective, and the melody does it's job very very well. Cheers to CHVRHCES and I look forward to hearing more from them in the future!<br /><br />Rating: 4.5/5 Stars<br />Best Songs: \\"Gun\\", \\"Tether\\", \\"Lungs\\" & \\"You Caught the Light\\"
B00ENTDDGW|1.0|The game itself was really good.  However, when I went to exit, I got a pop-up or ad asking if I wanted to research sex offenders.  I thought this was totally in appropriate.  So while the game itself was \\"fun\\", the advertisement was not!

A disappointment for me.  I may keep it anyway as this box set is now out of print and its value has since risen quite a bit.
B009P1WES6|4.0|Good story, well written!  Chilling and not for the faint hearted.  Rather far fetched at times - nothing great but worth the read!
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|What happened to my weekend?  Oh, right.  I spent it reading \\"Outview\\" by Brandt Legg!<br /><br />I'll be honest, I wasn't certain about reading this by looking at the summary.  But a friend liked it and the reviews were good, so I gave it a go.  And kept on going.  The layers of story keep pulling me in deeper and deeper.  I found myself drawn back to my Kindle again and again, thinking \\"Oh, I can't stop now.  Just one more chapter.\\"  Before I knew it, I had reached the end of the book, surprised that it was here already!<br /><br />From the start, I was drawn into Nate's strange world as he was coping with having these episodes he called Outviews.  Slowly, he lets his close friends in on his secret, only to uncover a deeper truth about his life.  The mysteries are plentiful but all woven together beautifully.  The first person narrative (a story-telling device I quite honestly fear trying to read) was done expertly.  There was something about the way Nate told his story that reminded me of Katniss Everdeen from the Hunger Games (one of my personal favorite books).  Like the Hunger Games, this book could be read and understood by teens, but the nuances of the characters and plot development lends it being enjoyed by adults as well.<br /><br />The way that the author explores and explains the metaphysical and spiritual aspects of the world was quite possibly my favorite part.  It is this use of his own knowledge to enhance the story without seeming pushy or being too unbelievable that makes this story truly unique.  Mr. Legg is able to use what he's learned in his own life as a part of the narrative in a clever manner with light strokes, never dragging the reader out of the story or making them feel preached at.<br /><br />The only critique I have for the book is that there are a couple of spots where odd details about the scene or what people were doing, eating, etc. that seemed a bit jarring or out of place.  (Such as the scene near the beginning where Nate is having a meal with his friends and lists off what everyone is eating.)  But those tiny details aren't enough to keep me from enjoying this story and looking forward to reading the next book in the series.

B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Iron Man 3, is a GREAT movie!  It flows very nicely with the other Marvel super hero movies.  Not only does it work well with the first 2 Iron Man movies, but the big pay off is how the story continues after the Avengers movie.  Robert Downey Jr. is the only actor for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man.  His acting skill really show when he has the rely on his wits and skill and not the Iron Man suit.  The writing is outstanding for the over all story line and all the characters development within the story.  The work and money put in the making of the movie shows on the screen.  Robert Downey Jr. heads a great cast of actors that look like they are having a great time working on the project.  My 8 year old son and I sat down and watched the other Marvel super hero movies, Thor, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 1 and 2, and The Avengers.  He and I saw Iron Man 3 when it was in the theater and I just watched it again this morning with my purchase.  I got the Iron Man 3 plus bonus features video, so he is really going to enjoy it!  I can not recommend Iron Man 3 and the other Marvel videos enough to anyone that is a fan or looking for a well made action movie.

B004SBULWE|5.0|I use this app to to force stop Netflix on all my portable devices. Netflix has a bug that if the screen blacks out while Netflix is on (i.e. from being paused, or falling asleep after show/movie has ended), its touch sensors will not recognize any inputs when turning screen back on. Therefore, you must force close Netflix and then you can re-open.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|Nelson Mandella's story is epic. This book provides a rare opportunity to see the world through the eyes of the oppressed, to sense the depth of despair, and the allure of violence. The tenacity required to emerge from decades of unjust incarceration as a whole person is stunning.

I glad I purchased his book but its kinda dumbed down and I only like maybe 10% of the songs.  I think the rock book would have been a better purchase for me but it wasn't out when i got this.  I would recommend it just cause you owe it to justin cause I know you been on his website.  BUy it from HIm NOT amazon though..  more money will get to him that way.

B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I enjoyed visualizing the trail as she hiked.  Occasionally more details of the people she met, her family and friends, would have been helpful.
1595141979|5.0|This is by far my favourite so far in the series, and they seem to just be getting better and better.<br /><br />SO much happens in this book. Really, I don't even know how I'm going to talk about any of it without totally ruining the book for everyone....<br /><br />The theme really starts to happen in this one. Aspects from the first two books come in and start to really show where the story is headed. Huge fight scenes and much drama happens and then you are left on a huge cliff hanger. I would talk about them more, but they really are a large part of the story and if I do I think I would ruin it for everyone. Also, some of the question are answered a little as well, but there are still many things left hanging. But you really get the feeling that everything is about to unravel and snap into place.<br /><br />We deal with a lot of grief throughout this book. After the events of the last one plus things that come to pass in this book everyone is pretty down throughout the whole thing. Lissa is probably the happiest besides Christian and Adrian though they aren't all totally happy either. They deal with a whole love square thing with Rose that is pretty much just made up in Christian's mind because he is jealous of how much time Adrian spends with Lissa because of their magic, but Adrian loves Rose who is just all about Dimitri and does even realise just how much he likes her until the end when she uses it against him. I mean, i totally feel sorry for Rose, she goes through some serious mind stuffing up stuff, from seeing ghosts and being consumed with black balls of hate and crazy which are not her own, plus more death. I can totally see why she is such a total bitch sometimes, why she is really stupid sometimes, but poor Adrian. Leave him alone, you toyed with poor Mason though you didn't totally mean to and it sent him off into crazy hurtness that did contribute to him dying, so don't do it to my poor Adrian. He knows its kinda a loss cause, don't play with hisadorable, sometimes annoying heart.<br /><br />The only time really that Rose isn't a complete ball of unstableness is when she makes with her relationship with Dimitri which hadn't really progressed at all since the first book until now. They finally just accept that they love each other and that they are going to have to find a way to make it work because they didn't want to keep fighting it anymore by the end of the book. Very cute stuff really. You kind of felt that Rose needed just a touch of joy. She didn't get many of those moments in this book. At the end even her and Lissa have a falling out, and though I can understand where Lissa was coming from I felt it was a huge step back in the personal development of her character. She had become so strong in personality and what not then at the end she is complaining and crying about how Rose isn't thinking she is the centre of the world and not putting her first for the first time ever. Rose hasn't been the centre of Lissa's world for a really long time and really doesn't offer herself up to be there for her (not an easy feet I know since Rose doesn't scream help me, but still) and its not fair to Rose to think that she (Lissa) has to be her whole world. There was even a moment when Rose is accused of letting someone attack Christian because she doesn't like him, and Lissa totally believes it. To me that wasn't something a bestfriend would have thought. I really wanted to slap her then.<br /><br />There is only one real thing that completely took me out of the story, and it was a writing fail. There was a point where three people were interacting but the writer got the names muddle up and called someone the wrong name even though it made NO sense that it would be referring to that person. I wont say who or where those because maybe if you hadn't read the book before like I have you wont notice. They have probably (hopefully) fixed it in later releases.<br /><br />Anyway, in conclusion there was a whole mess of plot development and action, there was relationship development both good and bad, and I was more caught up in the story way more than the others. I know im supposed to be reading other books because their authors are actually waiting for a review but I doubt it is going to happen. All I can think about what might happen next, and I would never be able to focus on another story anyway.
B00125WAWS|5.0|In the 1960s, I heard a black man tell a room of whites that if we believed in equality, we would each put a gun into the hands of a black man.<br />I flinched and I doubted the efficacy of such an action, though as a child of an extremely abusive father, I did not wonder at the man's conviction.<br />I watched this movie today and I know that the story is a testament to actions which are much more powerful than any gun can achieve. In addition, this film is nothing short of elegant in all aspects of its masterful portrayal.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book. Though some bits of it were not the most well done, I could not help but caught up in the story and the world.<br /><br />Im a sucker for dystopian or post-apocalyptic worlds, and if they are done well, which it is here, its just knocks my socks off. The world of the differently struggling and functioning districts controlled by this all mighty Capitol was really interesting. There were some really good little details added to the story about them as well, like how they each had their own style of bread that represented each of them. I also liked the idea of mutated animals to serve a certain purpose.<br /><br />You don't get to really meet many characters throughout the book very well, but I liked what I did get to know about each. Of course because the book is from her perspective, you got to know Katniss pretty well. At first she is pretty much described as someone who has it all together because she had to, because she had to grow up too quickly. But you also see cracks in the shell, which I thought was a nice change. While I believe that a girl in her situation could have it all together and be an adult in a younger body, but then I can also see how a girl in her situation could appear completely with it but have moments where the teenager comes through, specially if she has pretty much been handed a death sentence. For the most part she has it all, but then there are moments where she does teenage tantrums and breaks a punch of stuff. I do however that she was a bit too much of an ice queen the rest of the time though. I didn't really get the feeling that she cared about anything, however I think this had more to do with the writing style however than the character, she did and said a lot of the right stuff, but I just wasnt getting the feelings behind it all. I also thought that she thought too much sometimes. There were parts where I felt that too much information was given that really wasnt given.<br /><br />Peeta I thought we got a really good look at the kind of person he was, and at the end when they are going home and Katniss is being really a typical confused teenager, I really got the feeling of how crushed he was that everything he thought was actually happening was just a ploy to get them through the games. And even though we did not get to spend a lot of time with Gale, I also felt I know who he is and what he wants. Really, the love triangle that I see coming is one that I dont know how I want it to end up. On one hand Peeta and Katniss share a moment from when she was little and they have had a life altering experience together. On the other we have Gale who has has grown up with and shared many a moment together, though not nearly as significant as being in the games together.<br /><br />The other characters I felt I met them well enough, but I would have been happier if I had gotten to know a few of them better. I also would have liked to be given other perspectives at some points. Like for the Capitol, what the hell was going on there, what were they thinking? I kind of felt that I was in a black box and new nothing about the people who put me in there or what was on the other side. Im hoping for more information in the next two books.<br /><br />So all in all I thought the theme, plot and the character were all well done, however the writing style was a bit flat and lacking depth at times.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|Hate is the amazon choice of words; I prefer underwhelmed to the point of a near death experience. It is rare for me not to finish something, even a bad movie. I'll hand over my time to the idiotic but, not with City of Bones. If I had a physical rather than kindle addition, I would have struck a match and incinerated City of Bones to ash. I've read 5th graders with better grammar than this writer. Shame on the editor and publisher for bringing it to print. Not only is is poorly written; it is a rip off of the highest order. It lacks originality and prose; parents don't let your children read only to learn a teenage affair can take the place of good writing. It can't.

Looking forward to more functionality by Google in the future.

B000GG4XJM|5.0|That this album (including the extended version) has to be a candidate for the greatest American album ever made. It covers the length and breadth of the music that formed \\"American\\" music.  It's politics are left, as they should be, reflecting the music that rose from the immigrant workers and farmers that forged this country.  It feels communal, with many voices and yet one guiding vision.  Above all, it is tremendous fun and, in many instances, danceable.  A tremendous testament.

B009DCOU9S|3.0|Very simple little puzzles that you can do while watching TV.  Way too much talking between puzzles. Better for kids then adults.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I found the story line captivating and exceptionally well written.  I thoroughly enjoyed how the characters interacted.  The author captured each personality on multidimensional levels.  They came across as very real people finding themselves and love in a unique situation.
B005K17RU0|5.0|One of the best weather apps out there. Well worth getting. Worth five stars a definite must have for any tablet
B00BTYFWEA|5.0|A great debut for Val Kilmer (and I'm sure he could use a dose of the humor here considering the current state of his career).  He embodies the Presley/Beach Party mash up character he plays perfectly and carries with a completely straight face a movie plot that borders on the insane.  Airplane flew these skies first but Top Secret is a worthy addition to the genre created by the pilots of that original classic.  They didn't need a navigator for this one because they knew where they were going.  Peter Cushing and Jeremy Brett agreed because they're along for the ride.  The rest of the cast is hilarious and the parody works just fine along with the wonderful sight gags (who can ever forget the paratroopers droppings???)  To do this today you'd need Bieber and Disney's factory kids to pull it off - but the adults who took this on channeled their childhood foolishness into a very funny movie indeed.  Took me<br />thirty minutes to locate my head on the floor under the bed afterwards because I laughed it off!!!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|This game started out fun and I was enjoying t until I got to a level that keep repeating and wouldn't let me go further.  I'm deleting it today!
B008D1RDFS|5.0|Why the 2nd and 4th I'm not privy to but these are bare bones upgrades that you have to have if you love the series as I do.  The question is do they look better in blu-ray.  The answer is yes they do.  So if you're fans or just checking out the cult series for the<br />first time this is the version of the 2nd and 4th you need.  Unfortunately of this writing only the first 'The Crow' is out on Blu-Ray and the third 'The Crow Salvation' is only available on DVD (again I've no idea why but make sure you get the Dimension Collector's Series edition of it!).<br /><br />Sound on is DTS 5.1 or 2.0 Stereo (English both)
B008QMMEOE|1.0|Too dangerous to hand this to a toddler.  When they finish the 4 puzzles, the next ones are there, just greyed out.  Tap on one and it will take you to buy one.  If you have autopay set up like I do, you just bought yourself additional puzzles.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|While the premise may be similar to so many older films (i.e. any movie about dance groups, etc.), this one manages to play out on a much higher level.  The acting is smooth, even during &#34;awkward&#34; college moments, and the songs and performances are very well done.  Catchy tunes sung well - a good combination.
B00005U122|5.0|If you like Pink Floyd, then I suggest you check this video out, Roger Waters is amazing. Having seen him in concert I can only say that he sounds exactly as he does on this video, I liked so much I have bought for several of my friends and they were blown away. The seller was prompt in their shipping and delivery was at its destination promptly.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I found it slow and disconnected.  Some chapters were excellent and then the story would drag on, then it would get interesting again and so on.  I had to push myself to keep reading it to the end.

B006GWO5NE|4.0|I thought my Kindel Fire was broken as it would not hold a charge.

B00005JKTF|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. It has romance, intrigue and the acting and casting are great. I could have used a little more of Rupert Penry-Jones but his role didn't warrant that I guess. If you are a romantic, you'll love it. If you're a Cate Blanchett fan, you'll love it. If you're a WWII buff, you'll love it. I  think you'll love it.
B000000WJZ|5.0|1993 was a magical year in music and more specifically, to what many people would refer to as \\"college,\\" or \\"alternative\\" rock. There was the sublime The Cranberries Everybody Else Is Doing It So Why Can't We, The Verve's debut, A Storm in Heaven, which produced some of the most beautiful soundscapes ever elicited from an electric guitar. Not to mention The Breeder's cult classic Last Splash, as well as Catherine Wheel's metallic shoegaze classic Chrome.<br /><br />I believe that Siamese Dream is better than all of them and is the best album produced that year. Better than Exile in Guyville, better than Songs of Faith and Devotion, better than Suede's self-titled debut. And yes, even better than Nirvana's In Utero, which is a masterpiece in its own right.<br /><br />What makes Siamese Dream so impressive is the melding of so many different genres into one beautiful haze-induced dreamlike epic album.<br /><br />[...]

B00DQVSTCG|1.0|The right front & right rear audio does not work. Looks like there was a mistake made in the production of the Blu-ray version of this concert. Of course it could have been done on purpose just so Madonna could say f you again. Not sure how anyone could watch the first half of this concert more than once as it is full of blood, guns & violence. The music here is just as bad. There is enough violence in news broadcasts. I don't go to concerts or watch blue-ray concerts to see it again & then have Madonna give me the finger. I think I have bought my last music from this used to be.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I'd heard about Marcus Luttrell and was interested in hearing the story in his own words. Woven into the incident in Afghanistan is the story of what Marcus went through just to get into special ops. The strength it took to become a SEAL was really put to the test in real life. Marcus is a true American Hero and his story should inspire all of us but especially our youth who need a positive role model.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|This album is a good mix of the old (Supersoaker, Rock City and Don't Matter), and new KOL (Beautiful War, Wait for Me).  I've been waiting 2 years for another Kings of Leon fix (2011 tour was cancelled 2 weeks before I was supposed to see them in Chicago) and they did not disappoint.  Whether you're a die-hard fan from 10 years ago or just a 'Sex on Fire' radio-hit fan, you'll enjoy this album.
B00D6DVSAE|4.0|This album represents another in a long line of new directions for Sting -- show tunes, many of them acoustic and many sung in the Geordi accent of Sting's native Newcastle area. There is a strong sense of narrative as these songs come, apparently, from a forthcoming stage production. A lot of the music is wistful and melancholy, and much of it has strong Celtic overtones that give it an Irish-like feel.<br /><br />This is a good album and rates a solid four stars, with a qualification: If you're not already a Sting fan, I doubt you'll be converted by this one. But if you are the kind of a fan who gets into deep cuts and not just the \\"greatest hits\\", you may like it a lot. This album does not necessarily deliver immediate gratification, but will be worthwhile for fans patient enough to invest some time with it.<br /><br />In refreshingly disarming liner notes, Sting is up front about the fact that this album revisits the themes of the dying shipyards from Newcastle that provided the metaphorical backdrop for his album [[ASIN:B000002GL2 The Soul Cages]], a reaction to his own father's death. Sting describes The Soul Cages as \\"the least loved, least understood of all my recorded efforts\\". This time, rather than a sprawling New Age meditation on death, we have Celtic-inspired sounds, some quite rousing, many others quite lovely.<br /><br />After a couple of listens, I'm not hearing an obvious hit single here, which is in a way kind of refreshing for Sting. It is a solid album and seems to me designed to be listened to as an overall album rather than a collection of songs. The overall effect is pretty cohesive and pleasant, despite the sometimes peculiar, affected-sounding accents.<br /><br />In terms of comparison to Sting's earlier work, does anyone remember his \\"Mack the Knife\\" from the Kurt Weill tribute album [[ASIN:B000002GH2 Lost in the Stars]]? That what this reminded me of most -- largely acoustic with an old-fashioned feeling a lot of the time.<br /><br />Recommended if you like Sting and have patience for his grander visions that don't sail up the pop charts.mmended if you like Sting and have patience for his grander visions that don't sail up the pop charts.

B00DU74U74|3.0|As is so often the case, the movie is a somewhat pale reflection of the book, but it was still enjoyable and decent action. If you haven't read the book yet, watch the movie first - if you have read the book, keep your expectations low.

B00DJ80VLS|2.0|Dream Theater is a band that I own every studio and live album of! I have had the privilege of seeing them live on numerous occasions, and was never disappointed. I should mention that I was first introduced to the music of this band in the mid-to late 1990s, when a friend of mine (Matt), knowing my love for progressive music lent me his copy of \\"Images and Words\\". I have to say that I enjoyed the material immensely, in terms of the vocals and overall musicianship. What I didn't like about that album was the production. \\"Images and Words\\" sounds dated, because of the drum sound.<br /><br />I should probably state that I am a certified rehabilitation counselor, with a strong background in psychology, and sociology spanning over 15 years.<br /><br />I've always been into sound, and it's a proven fact that people psychologically consciously, or unconsciously link sounds with memories.<br /><br />Upon listening to the new self-titled Dream Theater, I found myself generally enjoying the songs, however throughout a majority of the album I was hearing quite a bit of what sounded like Rush songs. This isn't a problem, as I'm a fan of Rush, and I know that the guys in Dream Theater are as well, but in some places the similarities to the Rush albums \\"Permanent Waves\\", and \\"Moving Pictures\\" were actually scary. Moving through the album, the listener reaches the track \\"Along for the Ride\\", which if you take away Mike Mangini's drumming, it could pass for an alternate version of Emerson, Lake & Palmer's classic track \\"Lucky Man\\". Similarities in this album turn to outright plagiarism with the epic \\"Illumination Theory\\"! While listening to this track, I noticed this orchestral progression, and although it is a beautiful arrangement, I kept hearing something else in my head. I stopped the album after several listens, and thought about the melody I was hearing, and despite this progression being only a small portion of the epic track it doesn't just resemble, but is an exact ripoffof The Electric Light Orchestra's \\"Mission, from their album (A World Record).<br /><br />Dream Theater has always paid homage to their influences in subtle ways before, but the self-titled album is a bit, if not drastically obvious in its use of melodies, and sound in general, which brings me back to the statement I made earlier regarding my background in psychology. As I was listening to Dream Theater's \\"Dream Theater\\", something just didn't sound right, and was reminding me of something else. My conclusion was the production sound. The musicians, as always perform in a stellar manner, from James LaBrie's vocals, which are far superior on this album than on his recent solo release \\"Impermanent Resonance\\", to the performances of Jordan Rudess ,John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Mangini. With that said, the album ends up being week on originality, and heavy on its reliance of the \\"Images and Words\\" production sound to give the listener a feeling of comfort that this is the same Dream Theater they fell in love with years ago. If you play the new self-titled album, and any track on \\"Images and Words\\", the production sound is virtually identical. This is actually my biggest gripe with the new album, as I never liked the sound to begin with on \\"Images and Words\\". I could actually overlook the plagiarism that's abundantly apparent throughout the album, if I wasn't listening with such a critical ear, due to the production sound.<br /><br />I do think that the bands prior release \\"A Dramatic Turn Of Events\\" was a far better album, and it is clear that Mike Mangini is a great drummer, but Dream Theater should have taken more time to write their self-titled 2013 album.<br /><br />Founding member and original drummer Mike Portnoy, since leaving Dream Theater following the tour for \\"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\\", has went on to work with members of Deep Purple in the band (Flying Colors), and most recently Portnoy found even more success with (The Winery Dogs). Mike Portnoyhas also been the primary drummer for Neal Morse over the past decade, as well as the progressive rock supergroup Transatlantic!<br /><br />Dream Theater's 2013 self-titled album is good, but not great, and I fear that longtime fans of the band are unconsciously drawing a connection to the \\"Images and Words\\" album, and are therefore rationalizing their opinions of the new album. I'm sorry to say that I would not recommend the new Dream Theater album to anyone!<br /><br />If you're going to purchase a fantastic album, buy The Winery Dogs, Flying Colors, any of the Transatlantic albums, as well as those of Neal Morse. You're guaranteed to hear something fresh and original in those suggestions, as opposed to the new Dream Theater.<br /><br />I'm not an anti-Dream Theater fan, or resentful because Mike Portnoy is no longer with them, I am merely stating that since Portnoy's departure he has performed on some incredible material that dwarfs the new Dream Theater.
B001HNE3NO|2.0|This book highlighted an event of which I was ignorant and for that I am grateful but that's about as far as it goes.  A subject as deeply painful and momentous as this deserved better narrative and a more mature handling. The storyline did not envelop me and I found myself  disengaging the longer the story continued.  This was a great shame as the subject was worthy of more.  Too lightweight for me.

She narrates the story from heaven, a place that continually changes as she matures and watches her family's struggles and accomplishments on earth. Reeling from the grisly crime and not having closure to their daughter's death, Susie's parents have a difficult time coming to terms with this situation, and as a result, their marriage and relationships with their other two children suffer.

I'm glad I came to Amazon to find the product for less instead of paying more when the scenes are cut short and alot of the extras that were in the old releases are not included in this release. So 4 starts because I love the series but quite honestly I should've stuck with what I had because I got alot more.
B00459EZLW|4.0|This was a good series, though I understand why it needed to end.  I wish it had been better planned out like Battlestar Galactica or Breaking Bad. Plus, I still wonder what happened after the season ended.

B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Always loved this music.  The movie is frightening, depressive, schized me out, but the music is great.<br />These two CDs really exercised my equipment and really did the equipment (and my ears) justice.  Made me realize how important the quality of the media is. Made me feel the money and effort I put into my &#34;stuff&#34; was worth it. Few CDs are this good.  I guess the quality of the media is a craps shoot. I enjoyed this presentation without anything that detracted from just listening.

0307386171|5.0|McEwan's stunningly written story of a very young couple on their wedding evening is one I could not put down. Flying through the pages, I marveled at McEwan's ability to convey both Florence's and Edward's wildly different fears, views and experience of their slowly evolving physical intimacy. Edward and Florence, so very young, are hampered by the mores of the early 1960s, just before the cultural revolution that rang across the world. Despite the pair's disconnect, I expected the couple would work things out through their love for one another.<br /><br />The pair hurtles down a path, each of them headily driven by their individual youthful inexperience, entangled by their interior worlds and their so very different interpretations of what is happening between them. Their story is a jewel of an example of how it can happen that a well-meaning, loving couple can lose their way.<br /><br />While the story's pivotal event occurs less frequently today than in the past, it provides a launch pad for what made the book both memorable and useful. I've never been obsessed with a white whale or stumbled upon refuge from battle in a cathedral of trees, but I was enlarged by reading Moby Dick and The Red Badge of Courage. And that's one reason I read: to enlarge and deepen my understanding.<br /><br />From that perspective, On Chesil Beach offers something valuable to all but the most enlightened of us. McEwan shows Florence and Edward trapped alone an interior world that shapes how each interprets and misinterprets experience and one another. In our own lives, the rest of us peeking out from our own interior worlds have contributed to miscommunication and sometimes outcomes as devastating as the one Florence and Edward unwittingly create. This book deepens my compassion for people and prompts me to be more attentive to the place from which others may be hearing and experiencing the world.

B001F6TXME|3.0|Works as advertised, makes getting stable shots much easier. No problems with compatibility on my D3100. Only downside I have encountered (and it's minor) is that the plastic housing around the button tends to slide and stick. Otherwise, it's great.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|My mom showed my this, who was previously made aware by my brother. This game is exactly what it sounds like. It's fun, silly and the sharks are adorable! I particularly love the first shark's smile at the end of each level. I appreciate the challenge of not only getting all the ducks in the suggested number of shots, but you have to get the coins too. I'm currently on the third shark, and it's great that each has its own perks, i.e., the red can cut through chain. The suggested number of shots is very helpful, but sometimes difficult which I guess is the point of the game. I don't usually purchase games when I can avoid it, but this one is a good buy!

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I did a lot of research before purchasing this backpack, and compared to the more expensive brands this bag has all the same features at half the cost. It isn't as big as a typical backpack (like what your kids might use for school), but it has room for all the basics. I can fit my camera (D3100) w/ 18-55mm lens attached, a second lens (55-200 zoom), and two speedlights in the main compartment (which has removable/configurable padded dividers) along with hot-shoe translators and cords, and some other minor accessories. Plenty of pocket space for batteries and whatnot. This bag is easily worth double what it costs. I love it.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Sometimes SK can get a little weird; you know what I mean. But this was a great novel; interesting without being too out there. It actually turned out to be more of a love story, which I enjoyed. It also made me want to learn more about the 1960's. It is a period of time that I really know absolutely nothing about. I never remember learning ONE THING about this time in history in school. After this I am definitely going to read some non-fiction about JFK. This has also spurred some good conversations among my friends. It really is a great book!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great show.  Loved the new actors and the sets.  Definitely worth spending the money to watch and will probably watch it again.
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|I've been a fan since WDaDU so I was very excited to check out the new album. I've listened to this 3 times back to back and still cannot find a song that is memorable enough to enjoy. What a let down in my opinion.<br /><br />  ADToE was a major comeback and I was hoping the band would continue in that same direction but all for not. Petrucci and Mangini are clearly the star players as they perform the songs with power and precision. Rudess just sounds plain tired and just keeps rehashing the same fills and phrases over and over again. In fact I'm suprised he didn't add any ragtime breakdown like he usually does (sarcasm)! Everything sounds as if they tried to add every riff possible into a short amount of time resulting with songs being rushed. I'm all for prog-metal but c'mon, let the music breathe.<br /><br /> I just have to accept that 2013 was a very dissapointing year for new releases (A7X, Sabbath, Megadeth, Winery Dogs, etc.) and was hoping that Dream Theater would save that. Looks like I'm gonna have to add Dream Theater to that list as well. This is my opinion of the album so please don't take my word for it, so if you are a major fan then please listen to it and decide for yourself. Cheers!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie.  We need to remember or learn how bad it really was for African Americans during this time period.
B00E03ULJS|4.0|The Krew's first single from the record, \\"Live for the Night\\", is a Ke$ha-style party song that was one of the first songs the two sisters in the group wrote together. Aside from sounding like many other songs we've already heard, it's a pretty well-done number. \\"We Go Down\\", however, deviates from the pop formula with a drumstep beat and a hard high-pitched drop that goes double-time the second time around. The vocals are still there, but the party vibe is gone - now it's all about survival.<br /><br />\\"Come & Get It\\" is the first previously released track, coming from the trio's Play Harder remix EP, but it fits right in among the beats and rage-ready dubstep. So much better than the Selena Gomez track of the same title. \\"Enjoy the Ride\\" is a much more progressive pop song, describing exactly how much fun Jahan, Yasmine, and Kris are having in their crazy, crazy lives, and while it sounds once again like so much other pop, there's an uplifting vibe to it, and the lyrics are much more well-written than anything else you hear on the radio.<br />Get Wet cannot be placed into a single genre, nor labeled an entirely electronic album. It is simply this: a look inside the hearts of Jahan, Yasmine, and Kris, together the soul and backbone of Krewella.<br /><br />\\"We Are One\\" starts out similarly to \\"Enjoy\\", but the drop goes much harder - built for banging as loud as possible in the largest room possible. Things change up again on the excellent \\"Dancing with the Devil\\", featuring drums from Travis Barker and guest vocals from Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump. The vocals are just dissonant enough that it gives the song a rock n' roll edge, and the drums definitely help that edge. The Krew's massive hit \\"Alive\\" comes next, and though it's a good song, it feels a bit as if it was put here as a filler track.<br /><br />However, Krewella tries out a seriously different sound on the chillstep \\"Pass The Love Around\\", and it goes over...moderately well. It doesn't fit too well withinall the heavy beats, but it's a nice break before the absolutely massive hardstyle highlight \\"Ring of Fire\\" drops its four-on-the-floor kicks and dirty bassline. \\"Human\\" brings a bit of an emotional vibe with an acoustic guitar riff and a heavy yet melodic dubstep drop with a power ballad guitar solo.<br /><br />Up next is \\"Killin' It\\", another track from the Play Hard EP, and once again, it feels like a bit of a filler - but it's still a really, really good track. The album wraps up with the Pegboard Nerds collaboration \\"This Is Not The End\\", and it goes out with a dubstep bang. The sisters' voices drive the hard-hitting song along to the finale, still proclaiming that it's not the end.<br /><br />The verdict? Despite one or two filler tracks, and some songs sounding as if they're made for the radio, this record is jam-packed with destructive beats, gorgeous vocals, and some very cool collaborations. Play this one as loud as possible.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm always looking for the best deal in headphones. I have a few that are considered up there- Koss Porta Pros, some Senneheisers, the Grado 125's... and somehow I just found out about these a couple months ago through an article on Wire Cutter, when they named them the best headphone under $150.<br /><br />That was pretty remarkable considering they were almost half that- about $78 on sale when I got 'em here on Amazon. The closed (i.e., sound doesn't leak) design and coiled cord makes them more practical than the Grados. And both the structural design (especially the soft ear pads) and the sound itself (I found the sound of the Sonys less harsh and sibilant). Though the Grados have more 'punch' to the bass and a little more detail overall, I think this is the more balanced, true-to-the-source headphone. It's easy to see why they're the industry standard in recording studios around the world.<br /><br />I almost ended up getting the Audio Technicha ATH-M50, but after reading the Wire Cutter article, I got these instead. And at nearly half the price, I'm glad I did. These aren't a pair of headphones that will &#34;enhance&#34; the music you're listening to (like the M50's) through beefed-up bass; these cans will just give you a detailed, unbiased picture of the source: nothing more; nothing less. To some folks used to that sound,  they might think the Sonys sound &#34;recessed&#34; because their frequency balance is so remarkably flat.<br /><br />In summation: These are cans for music fans who just wanna listen to the music, not the headphones.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|Both the kids and the adults enjoyed the movie.  Lots of fighting action, no blood and gore, some emotional moments.  A good movie to watch as a family if you have teenage kids.

B006LSZECO|4.0|*SPOILERS WHEN INDICATED* I give Gone Girl four stars, but on it's own merits it deserves three, and compared to other thrillers out there it deserves five. Confused?<br /><br />You should be. Let me explain.<br /><br />It's really hard for me to give the kind of &#34;thrillers&#34; that come out nowadays any more than an average rating. You know the ones I'm talking about - the James Patterson, John Grisham thrillers with their No 1. Bestseller declarations on the covers and their huge fonts on the spines. Gone Girl was more than that; it was refreshingly above average in every way. A suspenseful plot meets fully-fleshed characters, excellent description and prose and subtle human drama to create a page-turning and haunting read. I feel like I should give it MORE than four stars, but really, if I did that I'd feel like a sellout. Here's why:<br /><br />The ending. The ending of Gone Girl was deeply, deeply unsatisfying. Not to mention rushed, out of focus, jolting, annoying, and unsettling. And don't give me no, &#34;Oh that's how the author intended it&#34; baloney. There will be *SPOILERS* in the next few sentences. Now don't get me wrong, I'm fine with books and films in which the heroes do not get retribution and the villains walk away Scot-free. Take a look at Animal Farm and The Usual Suspects for some instances of that. But the ending HAS. To Be. SATISFYING. And ultimately, having Amy - a ruthless, conniving, scheming, despicable femme fatale - getting her way (in everything) is unsatisfying on every level. Our protagonist Nick (who we alternately love and hate through the course of the narrative) - be screwed over and left in the clutch of one of the most hateable (and I don't mean in a good way, as in Joffrey from Game of Thrones) characters in recent memory. It's not that we feel hate towards her (though we do), it's that we hate hearing her, seeing her, and even reading about her. And worst of all? She gets away without one shred of remorse or punishment. This is not a nice feeling to have, and ultimately, the book falls short when it comes to the ending. *Spoilers end* What should have ended with a brutal impact...ended like the flop of a floundering fish.<br /><br />But hey, let's talk pros: The writing was rich and vivid, with great descriptions, chilly moods, atmosphere, and great characters. Gillian Flynn gets you into the minds of her characters like no one else. It's a pity that through out the entire novel, there is not one supremely likeable or relateable character. The plot was suitably intricate and convoluted, and I just loved the &#34;unreliable narrator&#34; aspect of it all, though I was decieved before reading into believing that Gone Girl was a fast paced mystery. It isn't. The plot is slow-burning, taking a long time to get going, but is always engrossing and somewhat riveting. Don't go into this expecting something you will not get: a fast-paced, action-packed thriller. What you will get is a slow-burning, engrossing, complicated, realistic, and twisted thriller. And that's great on it's own merits, isn't it.<br /><br />So that's my review. Gone Girl gets 4 stars for the suspense and atmosphere, not to mention the ingenious plot and characters, though loses points for the absymal anticlimax, for zero sympathetic characters, and for the long time it takes to get started. But once it gets started...this is one of the most memorable and astonishing works of thriller fiction published in recent memory. And it's over to you, David Fincher. Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck should knock this out of the park..

B00E3I3KDE|5.0|I had enough sense to get both CDs, which entailed both the original Halcyon album and the new Halcyon Days and I didn't have to choose whether I put the one CD in my car or my stereo; I could put one in each now.  Also, the new album was just as good as the new one.

0307352153|5.0|I'll be adding this book to my collection of life-changing books.  A very eloquently presented new paradigm in which introversion is no longer thought of as a disease.  This book will do a lot for introverts who have grown up feeling that they were somehow inadequate and want to feel more comfortable in their own skins.
B00DJZR46G|4.0|I have eagerly awaited Elton John's new albums since I was a kid. I have gone to several midnight release nights at local record stores. Thanks to digital music, that's no longer necessary. The new music can be \\"auto ripped\\" to my computer. As an added bonus, Amazon.com allowed streaming of \\"The Diving Board\\" a week before it's American release so I have listened to it every day since it became available online.<br /><br />From the first piano notes of \\"Oceans Away\\" and Elton's gentle vocals, it's clear this is going to be a striped-down affair, with Elton's beautiful piano playing front and center. The tinge of melancholy in Bernie Taupin's lyrics on the opener, tell of hanging with the \\"old folks\\" to gain some of their wisdom before they pass away.<br /><br />\\"Oscar Wilde Gets Out\\" picks up the pace with the story of, you guessed it, Oscar Wilde. With just the piano, bass, and drums, Elton (as Taupin's muse) tells the tale of the Irish poet and writer. Again, Taupin's lyrics shine while Elton's keyboard swirls around the story and travels of Wilde's brief life and career.  It's an entertaining tale.<br /><br />\\"Town Called Jubilee\\" finds Elton and Bernie in a Southern mood, with a jaunty little tale backed by some good gospel vocals.  By the end of the song, you feel as though you visited the vividly portrayed town.<br /><br />The first three songs are one of the best opening three tunes of an Elton album in a long time.<br /><br />\\"The Ballad of Blind Tom\\" takes a little darker turn telling the story of a \\"freak\\" who entertains all comers. The strings add some texture to this song and again the piano is right up front in the mix.<br /><br />Next is the first of three short interludes labeled as \\"Dreams\\". These are just throwaways and don't really add to the flow of the album.<br /><br />\\"My Quicksand\\" is a rather depressing song, describing the protagonist's downfall due to \\"foolish notions.\\" It's just Elton and his piano except for some minor percussion during the bridge.<br /><br />Next follows one of the weakest songs on the album, \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight.\\" It may remind loyal Elton fans of \\"Turn the Lights Out When You Leave\\" from \\"Peachtree Road.\\" It's a rather mundane song. Elton and Bernie are capable of much better.<br /><br />\\"Voyeur\\" is next.  It's a hard song to get a handle on. It's a quieter version of Phil Collin's \\"Thru These Walls\\": a little spooky and disturbing. Maybe it's Taupin's commentary on today's surveillance prevalence.<br /><br />Then comes the gorgeous \\"Home Again\\" which hooked me from the very first listen on Facebook. Maybe it was the beautiful landscape in accompanying the video, which I highly recommend everyone view. But the music and the mood of the lyrics link perfectly. It's the story of the melancholy of a person looking back on how far one travels only to end up longing to go back home again. I have listened to this song dozens of times and have not tired of it. It is certain to become a John/Taupin  classic. The piano playing is wonderful.  Listen to the way Elton phrases \\"or was that just some nightclub singer back in 1963.\\"<br /><br />Up next Elton saunters into \\"Take This Dirty Water\\" a surprisingly successful gospel-tinged roll. I have been critical of Elton in the past for his attempts at gospel, but in this case I think he hits the mark, thanks to combination of the piano, backup vocalists, and handclaps. The song doesn't have a lot to say but it saunters nicely.<br /><br />\\"The New Fever Waltz\\" slows the pace down, talking about \\"too much war, too little love\\" and the innocence of the dance before battle. The piano solo in the break is beautiful, supplemented by a gentle horn section.<br /><br />\\"Mexican Vacation\\" took a few listens to grow on for me. The live version from the Columbia session really helped me take to the song. Elton's piano is superb throughout and the tune really swings.<br /><br />Last comes the title song, \\"The Diving Board\\" a surprisingly dull finale. Themetaphor doesn't work for me, but maybe other listeners will relate.<br /><br />I was not thrilled when I heard T-Bone Burnett was producing this album. I am not a fan of his stripped down, organic production. I think several of the songs on Elton's previous album \\"The Union\\" (with Leon Russell) could have been better with a different producer. But I think Burnett did OK with this effort. Minimal instruments and add-ons really allow Elton to make this album the piano album he has been promising fans for years. I hope his existing fans and new fans give this album a few listens. I give it a B+ and recommend it.
B00CA4S27W|4.0|This is another good effort from Blackmore's Night. No surprises here and in many ways more of the same from this group. Over the past several years they have carved out a nice little niche with their modern spin on &#34;Renaissance Music&#34;. Their sound is a blending of old world music meets modern instruments. Candice's voice is a delight to listen to and she delivers again with this set. Richie's guitar and other string work is excellent as always. The songs are very much in keeping with their past efforts. However, none of them really grabbed me. I guess I am always looking for that special something in a song that strike a cord with my soul. Those songs are few and far between and while the tracks on this album are good, none of them reach that level. If you're a fan you'll enjoy this album. If you are new to their music, this is a good representation of what they do so well.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Once I started this book I could not put it down.  Watching Cheryl's awakening and transformation as she walked the PCT was remarkable.  Great book!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Smart, and funny, and sad. Well rounded read. Made me cry a little at the end, but worth it. Would reccomend to others of all ages.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|this was for my son who had a storke and missed the season, he is able to keep up with the season.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|Awesome shots, awesome acting, intense movie, you would never know this movie is 3 hours long unless you timed it.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I was a little surprised this was a really good movie, wish I could have seen it in theaters hope a sequel comes out!
B00ESB5KXE|4.0|This show is absolutely hilarious. I'm thrilled about the last season; however, it is spelled peek not peak. Kind of ruined the preview for me. HA not really.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|This story is amazing. It's one of the best I've ever read. Rainbow Rowell is a genius. I love realistic fiction and I've been looking for a good one for the longest. Fangirl is the definition of realistic fiction. Cath is my untwin. She's socially awkward and one of the most interesting characters ever. Her college experience is the real deal. And I just love her and Levi! The writing is perfect and it's easy to visualize. This was my first time reading a book by this author and it will not be my last. I will never get tired of this story.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Terrific as always. Definitely continues the tradition of excellence. Can't wait for season 11!!! Not looking forward to Ziva's departure though.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Okay I have to admit I was predisposed to like this book.  I have been playing with the concepts it presents for a while now.  That said I have to say that this book blew me away.  I would read a section or a paragraph and got so excited that I would have a physical reaction and had to stop and walk around or do something to integrate what I just read.  I could not stop reading to do the experiments so I decided to read it straight through and then go back through it to do the experiments.  It is a great book.  Read it with an open mind and heart.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Everything right at your fingertips. Great little word games<br />for you to explore. Best app out there.<br />Reminds me of Bookshelf. Remember that?
1781162646|4.0|When I got this book and took a good look at it I was a little disappointed. I love Stephen King and hadn't read the description carefully before I snatched it up, so I didn't realize this was a hard crime/mystery novel rather than his usual fantasy/horror. And honestly the cover, while it DOES remind me of those old style murder mystery novels, is not the type of cover that has ever drawn my attention.<br />  However! Despite the fact that I don't read this type of fiction, I found myself really getting into it. Part of me kept waiting for something creepy or supernatural to happen, but it didn't... and in the end I didn't care. It was a good book and I enjoyed it even if it wasn't what I expected. I guess you've conquered another genre, Mr. King!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game as well, I just feel that it would be better if we didn't have to pay to get to the next set of holes. It forces me into playing the same ones over and over again.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Won't work with 1st gen Ipad, or windows XP. Barely works with my android smartphone. The four available apps are not anything I use. No amazon prime. No internet access.<br /><br />Wasted my money.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This story has your emotions all over the place because it's raw and you fall in love with the characters.<br />Everything you think you know turns out to be something else, life isn't always what it seems.<br />I love that it shows such beauty can come out of such evil and that YOU get to decide what your future holds, not your past.<br />Highly recommend to all readers!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I read this book, because I like the author.  It is a good blend of history and fiction.  A very nice paced story for those that are familiar with the author.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I needed a replacement cable It came apart after two days. The port fell apart. I was very disappointed with it.
B003YOMNCM|5.0|This item was a gift for my friend, the doctor who is a violinist.He was both surprised and most pleased asshe is one of his favorite artists.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app can be boring but also very fun. The problems can be challenging but some are not. Thank you for reading my review.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Great Film...better than the first!!!  Fast paced, lots of action, watched it several times already! Hope they make another or a series like Riddick!
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I probably don't read as much as I'd like. It's difficult to find writers that get to the point from page one, keep you engaged and bring you something you can use from nearly each chapter.  Jason and David have done it with Rework.  I can't make major changes in my corporate environment, but I've learned several smaller tips that should help me work smarter everyday. I'm heading to Amazon and preorder &#34;Remote&#34; now and looking forward for that read too!
B0030IIZ3S|5.0|All three are great but I have my own preference for this one. It's got moments of deep emotion without feeling like it's beating you up (which the third one does a little) and keeps the fun and the jokes coming at a steady pace. Really my only issue is my longstanding complaint about Disney not putting out a Blu-Ray only release, and forcing consumers to buy two copies of the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm reading it for the second time. The story moves forward rapidly and is not descriptive heavy. Just enough to give good mental imagery.
B002NXSRW0|4.0|Yes it's stupid, but it's fun stupid. I'm not much of a G.I. Joe fan to be honest but this is brainless entertainment done right. It really captures the insanity of boys playing with these kinds of toys (&#34;My guys have a secret base under the ice.&#34; &#34;Oh yeah? Well my guys have all these little subs and we're gonna storm your base!&#34; or &#34;My ninja is better than your ninja!&#34; &#34;Nuh-uh!&#34; etc.) The action is fun and well paced, and the performances aren't embarassing, not even Marlon Wayans. Dumb fun at its best.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I actually resisted reading the series because of Suzanne's method of pov, but once I got into the series, I couldn't put it down and was often surprised at how smooth the reading went.
B00009NHC5|5.0|Movies like this just are not made anymore.  All the suspense without the violence and gore we see so much of now.
B008645YEE|5.0|It came on the 17th of September.  It's sound quality is just to my liking! I can't wait to upload to my iPod!  6 stars!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|The special features are very good this season.  I do wish there was a longer &#34;gag reel&#34;, but, maybe they are that good and no many errors?
B0089J270U|5.0|This disc as rated by BLURAY DOT COM, which i always look at before a BD purchase was RIGHT ON THE MARK saying: &#34;...ease, with newfound detail and texture and overall refinement. The transfer's candy-hued color palette —which might pass for Technicolor—is simply stunning, with vivid reds, intense blues, and creamy skin tones. Contrast and tonal balance are spot-on, and besides the expected—and brief—color fluctuations around scene changes, the picture is stable and consistent..... If a little dynamically flat and bass-less, like a lot of mid-century movies, the music sounds great, with no peaking in the highs and no hisses or crackles.&#34; ...... and is a stunning piece of WIDESCREEN musical film magic.
0345528581|3.0|Hundreds of 5 star reviews should make anyone suspicious in this category. This is not, and never will be a classic.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />The only part of the book that is really good is the actual descriptions of exercises, and this bumped an otherwise 1 star book up to 3 stars, since they are the main reason I bought the book. The exercises are pretty much in order of difficulty within muscle groups, with very good descriptions and clear photos. I started doing strength training a couple months ago, and was looking for a reference of bodyweight exercises I could use to vary and scale up my workouts. This book supplies plenty of material, some of which is so difficult I will probably never be able to do it, and plenty more that is at or near my level. Some of the exercises involve props, like heavy boxes, chairs, or doors, but nothing that people don't commonly have around the house. That said, I'm looking into making a sandbag or something else cheap and heavy instead of trying to use a backpack or box of books, and the only door I'd trust my weight to when hanging off the top is the door to the outside.  This section could be improved with descriptions of what poor form looks like, what the most common form errors are, and more pictures of some of the advanced exercises. It could also be improved changing the format of how variations are listed to make it clear they are variations, and why making a certain change increases or decreases the difficulty. It is often, but not always obvious. But since the book is cheap, this section is still worth 5 stars.<br /><br />The rest of the book falls way short.<br /><br />The indifferent:<br /><br />The sample workouts aren't very useful to me, and neither is the section on how to build a workout. The samples are not a standard workout program (3-4 days a week, x number of sets and reps), such as I was looking for simply because it is proven, easy to remember, and easy to carry out, and for a beginner any programis novel. Instead, he tries to make it `interesting', even at the beginning level. Instead of a set number of reps, he wants you to do `Ladders', which is a variation he describes earlier in the book. They don't sound like a bad way to gain strength, but it's more complicated than saying do the exercise x number of times, adjusting x or the exercise as your strength grows, and he gives no evidence as to whether his ideas are more or less effective than standard sets of reps. He also has 5 days a week of working out, which is a lot (some days hard, some easier). His sample workout is designed to get you into boot camp style shape, but that is not everyone's goal, and he does not provide detailed information on how to scale down for people who can't handle that much, or simply don't need that level of result, and don't want to put in that much work.<br /><br />He has a little information on how to design your own program, but it isn't well structured, and again, for a beginner who doesn't know what they are doing, it lacks detail. I ended up using the Ultimate Weight Training Workout Routine on an outside website to figure out what a good strength program should include, plus this book to pick which exercises.<br /><br />He's also got a chapter on nutrition. Take it for what it is- a guy who is in really good shape, and eats fairly well is telling you what works for him. It may work for you, it may not. It doesn't add anything to the book's value.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />The book's introductory chapters were almost enough to turn me off completely. He writes about his background, trying to prove his credentials. A one paragraph About the Author section would have done the same job. I was pretty indifferent to his life story (yes, you're clearly a macho man, now get over yourself), but then it goes downhill. He's got a bunch of bull about how bodyweight is better than free weights, and therefore everyone should do it, but doesn't bother with actual evidence. Personally, I use it because it's cheap, and can be done anywhere. That's one of his arguments, but he also gives the hilarious example that no one ever lies on their back to lift things, the way a bench press has you do. Later in the book, he extols the pushup. Personally, I've never tried picking up heavy things while lying on my face. Promoting your chosen method of gaining strength is one thing. Pretending another proven method is illegitimate just makes you sound stupid, especially if you don't bother with science or even logic to back up your personal biases.<br /><br />Minor point. Something common to every strength training book I've read is that they are written for men. They usually include a few pages about how women can and should train almost exactly the same as men, and in this one half the pictures are of a woman, but the prose is aimed towards men who want to look big and manly, and lift heavy things like a manly man can. Not worth a star, but definitely enough to make me roll my eyes at some points.<br /><br />Overall: The list and description of exercises earn this book a legitimate place on my shelf. If I ever run out of shelf space, I can always tear out the other half of the book.
0375714839|3.0|I had to read this for a class. Initially, I didn't want to take it seriously because it looked like a comic book. I found that it was very interesting and insightful. It was a quick read, also.
B001NA6096|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was way too young to appreciate it.  I recently watched is again and loved the dialogue.  It's literally two people who happen to meet, spend a day together talking and getting to know each other.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again and again.  Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have great chemistry.

B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I really like the story... and the real truth about how we get fat. I believe Gary Taubes is on the right track with his research.<br /><br />The writing style is difficult to follow, which is a shame because I think more people should get to know this perspective and embrace it towards better health. Maybe there'll be a next edition that's a bit easier to read or a simplified/outlined version??

B009UX2YAC|5.0|ok so this game is like temple run. if you have played despicable me minion rush this is like that to. to me, this game is both of them combined. I highly suggest you get this FREE game if you like minion rush, temple run, or if you don't know what either of those are, try it. It is FREE! enjoy. hope this helps. :)
B00CM4VC7M|4.0|This is a fantastic figure, fully pose-able, with smooth movements and way more detail and attention than I would have dreamed. All of the paint is bright, clean and crisp, with a slight sheen that looks great in the light. The faces, hands, and accessories provide tons of possibilities for poses, and I like the subtlety of the stand. My main disappointment was in the packaging. Like the other reviewer, my box had a seriously mangled corner, which is probably a first of anything I've ever ordered from Amazon. I guess they decided to play soccer with the one thing I cared about staying nice. I also was kind of \\"meh\\" on the box graphics, hoping for more new art versus pictures of the figure. I would have been more excited to display it in that case, right now it's just nicely stored in the closet to prevent future mangled corners. It's wonderful to have such a quality reminder of a character that was so dear to me during my adolescence, although the 20th anniversary does definitely make me feel aged! Happy birthday, Sailor Moon!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Great story line and keeps you wanting to watch.  Great value and awesome that it is part of prime.  Thanks Amazon!

B000SGSU58|3.0|Well written and well edited crime novel.<br /><br />LA police detective (Harry Bosch) is being sued in court for wrongful death of a man that he believed was The Dollmaker serial killer.  He's being sued by the wife, four years after the police had closed the file on Dollmaker.  Unfortunately, a new `Dollmaker like' murder victim is discovered during the trial, which sends Harry's defense team and the LA police department into a scramble.  Did Harry nail the wrong guy?  Maybe a copycat?<br /><br />Good courtroom drama and murder mystery.
B00000FCBC|4.0|This disc has several songs I like, and several I do not care for.  Music taste is totally subjective so my favorites might drive the next person crazy.
B005DC68NI|5.0|This book lives up to its billing. It is not like so many other how-to-become-an-ebook-millionaire-without-really-trying type books. It treats writing not only as an art, but as a business. Like anything, intelligent work coupled with persistence increases one's chances of success.<br /><br />I appreciate the 30 or more real life examples of ordinary people having extraordinary success. David's appendices are also filled with really helpful information.<br /><br />Thanks for a great book!<br /><br />Eric M. Hill<br />Author of &#34;The Mystic's Journey.&#34;

B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I love the graphics of this game, they are just stunning! The single negative thing that I would say about this game is that the sounds are extremely noisy! Every time that i play the game I have to turn down the media volume. But that is something of personal taste... The app is really good. Entertaining, well thought, stable, and is for the general public. Great job, developers!
B004WO57E4|5.0|My daughter loves this game. She lost one of the discs, and buying the collection was cheaper than buying hte once disk she had lost.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|The UI is great. The app is very intuitive. Connects pretty fast regardless of if on WiFi or LTE. I have been using it for just 15 mins., and i like it already. I do not expect anything bad to happen. I recommend it.

B000LC4ZF8|4.0|I think this is one of Tom Hanks best, he never loses character; even as an adult.  This move had added things that were cut from the theater version; which makes it much better.

B00B8YSIMY|5.0|Oscar Wilde once wrote, \\"The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.\\" Jimmy Walker, the main character of this story, is far from being a saint. At the same time, he definitely has a future - a conclusion that was far from obvious at the beginning of his quest back to himself and to normalcy.<br /><br />Plagued by his addiction to cocaine, grieving a dead child but determined to make a positive change, Jimmy leaves his native England for Spain's Costa del Sol where he is supposed to start a job. The beginning is hopeful, but things don't work out for Jimmy, and his problems get more and more aggravated as he is immersed into the world of superficial people, faces a job too focused on materialistic possessions, and struggles to regain control of his life in the face of his own vulnerability to his darkest demon, his drug addiction. Jams N. Roses poignantly describes is as \\"the habit was there, it had clawed its way into my daily routine and I couldn't shake it.\\"<br /><br />The story is filled with insights into the psychology of an addict for whom \\"the drug-high can actually become the highest priority.\\" His life quickly descends with the loss of the job, accumulating health problems, and meeting strangers who involve him with dangerous jobs and activities that get him deeper into the cocaine habit.<br /><br />In one of the many ironic twists of this psychological thriller, it is through a dangerous liaison with somebody else's girlfriend that Jimmy rediscovers his passion for life and is \\"reminded that there are natural highs in life, highs that didn't involve putting toxins in your body via smoking or injecting or sniffing synthetic drugs.\\"<br /><br />As Jimmy is re-evaluating his definition of success, questioning the true meaning of life and searching for his true identity, he is determined to make a change. He wants to get away from pretentious clubs and pretentious people but gets himself deeper into trouble before regaining a glimmer of hope for a brighter future.<br /><br />Despite the darkness and grimness of the events in the book, the story follows the classic quest structure and has an uplifting ending. Jimmy is coming back home, but he is a changed man. And this time, the change promises to be permanent. This novel provides a very interesting and insightful look into the mind of a self-aware addict attempting recovery.

B000SEFNMS|4.0|Many things have been written about this book so I will not add much. But this is a great short read. Anyone who has walked in the wilderness understands what this kid saw-but amazingly he found a way to continue his trek for two years.  With the detailed description of Chris' adventure as well as other &#34;extreme adventurers&#34; (including the author himself) this book will make you think twice about how you live your life, what each of us needs in this world and what we are missing by living &#34;normal&#34; lives.
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham must do some great research because you always feel so much smarter after one of his books.  He can tell a story about the law and make you like the lawyers for their integrity.  Main characters are always good guys and that's the way it should be.  They say he writes so his grandmother can read it without being offended.  It's true.  You may want to slug some of the characters, but they are still fascinating.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Seasons 2 and 3 were good, but this was back to being great. It constantly left me wanting to know what happened to Dexter next.
B005UPOAT2|5.0|John Cusack is so adorable and sweet and I love Kate's accent.  Very cute story and good romance movie.  Chick flick, of course, but you still gotta love it.
B0018J2QB8|4.0|This wasn't as masterfully put together as Season 1, but that's fairly common for shows. It was still a very fun watch.
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|I can't watch this because it's based on a true story.  I would prefer fiction.  My guy loves this movie, though.  He watches it when I'm not home.  It's painful and scares me to death.  Too real for my taste.
B0028KF4M4|4.0|This show is very entertaining, but I think it is like most shows that are meant to be suspenseful or dramas. It has to keep things exciting, so it comes up with new plot twists, but the more it does that, the tougher it is to keep it all making sense together and the more cope outs there are.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I recommend it to people who are into mystery/horror. This was a kind of book that was hard to put down. I couldn't stop reading!!!!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Wonderful movie. Takes me back to my childhood and so happy I get to share it with my daughter. Makes a wonderful addition to my her collection!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hi just want to tell everybody thinking about reading this that is is definitely worth it and I would recommend all of them

159562015X|4.0|The premise is that the strengths of people can be grouped into 34 discrete themes (such as ideation, responsibility, strategic, etc,) and that any person's 5 strongest themes can be found through a short, multiple choice online assessment.  Advice is then given as to what to do with those strengths.<br /><br />Their assessment of my strongest themes rang true with my experience, and the advice seemed apropriate.  I would have liked to see all my themes ranked, and not just the top 5, so that I could have an idea of my watch-outs too, and how to manage those too.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Very good double CD set.  Buddy Guy has that Muddy Waters feel and in the music you can hear the influence he received from others as well as that he had on Stevie Ray Vaughan and others as well.  The nice little surprises like Steven Tyler and others added some interesting and good twists.<br /><br />Pour a martini and kick back and enjoy!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Probably because most of my music collection still resides in the 80's, I am just now beginning to explore some of the more popular artists of today. All of my younger friends recommended Bruno Mars and I'm thrilled that they did. This is a wonderful album, his voice sounds like he swallowed Stevie Wonder and Michael McDonald, there is not one weak tune on the album, his ballads are old-fashioned love songs and his up-tempo tunes have a wonderful R&B feel that keep your head bobbing. Good album, glad I bought it.

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Published with permission from MusicPlayers.com, the online magazine for serious musicians:<br /><br />If you're one of the skeptics wondering what was to become of Dream Theater in the post-Portnoy years, fear not. On the aptly self-titled album, Dream Theater, the band reminds everyone why they are the most beloved band in the prog metal genre. This is an album true to their name, and one that deftly combines heavy metal with progressive rock and classic hard rock. It's full of orchestral movements, extraordinary musicianship, loads of rich melodies and powerful rock content. It paints a picture; it tells a story.<br /><br />We knew that bringing Mike Mangini into the band lineup was going to really take things to another place once he became part of the songwriting process--the drum parts for A Dramatic Turn of Events were already written when he joined the band in 2011. Sure enough, the drumming here is sure to dazzle and impress. There's plenty of double-kick work to keep metalheads pumping their fists, but it's all the other grace and groove that Mangini brings that creates a subtle shift in the vibe of the music and takes it to places slightly new.<br /><br />Two of our favorite tracks,\\"The Looking Glass\\" and \\"Surrender to Reason\\" pay obvious progressive rock homages to Rush. In fact, there are multiple songs on Dream Theater that clock in under six minutes. But we were drawn in right from the orchestral opening and demonically tight and heavy guitars of \\"False Awakening Suite\\" and left in awe by the album closing, twenty-two minute epic, \\"Illumination Theory.\\"<br /><br />John Petrucci's guitar work is stellar as usual, as is the keyboard work of Jordan Rudess and the bass work of John Myung. There are plenty of subtly different guitar tones on display here for the tone obsessed (yes, it's all still obviously Mesa tone), and Rudess' chops are dazzling as ever, and share space with some great orchestra performances in the album opening and closing tracks.<br /><br />Myung is on fire. Not only did he contribute lyrics to a song (die hards look for this little detail), but you'll hear him soloing (along with other bandmates) on the instrumental track, \\"Enigma Machine.\\" Yes, you heard it, sports fans. It's the return of the instrumental, and it rips, complete with dueling soloing lines like only this band can deliver.<br /><br />And what of our dear friend, James LaBrie? Fantastic job with the vocals here. I think the work he's done on his two recent solo albums (check out his fantastic new release, Impermanent Resonance) has influenced his vocal contributions here, as he's sounding really melodic, sometimes with a big rock voice, as well as delivering some nice intimate moments set against acoustic guitar backdrops. Favorites would have to include the memorable, \\"Along for the Ride,\\" with a vocal hook that will stick in your head like a classic `70s rock song (not to mention the vocals are followed by a very Keith Emerson-like synth solo).<br /><br />Enough of my babbling. There just isn't any weak spot on Dream Theater. We love this release. This is Dream Theater sounding better than ever. If you were a rabid fan of the band circa Images & Words, Awake, and Falling into Infinity, you'll find this album to be more of a return to form, but combined with their updated, modern metal edge. And once again, we're thrilled that overly aggressive mastering didn't kill this release like far too many metal genre records today.<br /><br />-- SK<br /><br />(to read this and other reviews, please visit MusicPlayers.com)

Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert are in top form as always.  The highlight of this delightful recording is Handel's Eternal Source of Light Divine--one of the most beautiful things I've heard in a very long time.  Highly recommended.  Five stars.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|SS is a lot of fun. My only complaint is that there are no clearly written instructions dealing with differences between coins and points, as an example. They may exist within the app somewhere, but if there, they are hidden. I personally had to go to youtube to find them from another source. Frustrating at times. But very fun.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I loved this movie. The film was intense. Once the action started, it never let up. Brad Pitt's Production Company had a bidding war with Leonardo De Caprio's Production Company over Max Brook's book &#34;World War Z&#34;. Brad won and started trying to get it made as far back as 2005. Marc Forster wasn't their first choice as Director but he proves he can tighten the screws and never let up all the way through and the extra minutes that the unrated version adds just makes it more so. For those looking in this version for the original ending, it's not here. Word was the original 40 minute ending was re-filmed. I'm hoping in a few months, Paramount will say &#34;Hey, if we release this DVD/BluRay again and add the original ending along with the theatrical ending, we'll make a fortune again.<br />As the time of this review, the film cost about $190 million dollars to make and had made almost a billion dollars worldwide. Pitt has plans for two more sequels and I hope they are as good as this one as Brad Pitt as a retired UN Negotiator is blackmailed into traveling the globe to find where the virus started, so his family can stay safely aboard the Navy vessel they were rescued to. The action is believable and the gore is minimal. Although the film is rated PG-13, I would think twice about letting any child see this film. They may have nightmares for weeks. For that matter...so may you!

B000007MVX|5.0|I was fortunate enough to have been in the audience for this show, it was my first Tull concert. Watching Ian Anderson jump around the stage like a mad conductor using arms, legs and flute to accentuate movement and tempo changes. The music is very complex and intricate. To me, it's a masterpiece.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|pretty good device and really cheap compared to its competition however the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is its limited ability to stream only certain videos i wish they had pandora support and maybe a mirroring function for your phone! but still a really new product so there is still hope they will improve it
B007W8S2MG|4.0|I read raving reviews about this game and took the leap and bought it.  It is a pure RPG with interesting features.  The story is a little slow at start but hopefully will get better.
B00DYZ2YVG|5.0|With the author as the main character in this book he sets out from the beginning by stating how predictable zombie novels are. But in this case, that is as far as the predictability goes!<br />Set in Wales and a realistic explanation given for the rise of the zombies, this story begins an apocalyptic journey where the remaining humans, holed up in a deserted mine have the unenviable task of finding an antidote for the zombie inducing illness.<br />Because this is different to so many zombie novels which are not my usual cup of tea, I found this tale enjoyable and engaging.
0307950654|1.0|I was so disappointed in this book. I've been a fan of PD James; she usually writes interesting mysteries, and they are great. But in this book she attempts to write in Austen's style and fails miserably, in the process delivering a dull, unimaginative and utterly pointless book. The story purports to be a murder mystery, but lacks any of the normal aspects of the genre. There is no detection, either amateur or professional; there is no discovery of clues or pertinent information. The denouement is the result of a deathbed confession, and surprises all the characters. So on the basic level of a 'whodunit' it fails miserably.<br /><br />But for a true Austen fan, the worse problem is James' ham-handed attempt to sound like Austen. She uses old-style prose, but has none of the wit or sensitivity of Austen; her plot is terribly thin and its development is repetitive and redundant; and the end result bored me to death and irritated me. Additionally, she turns some of our favorite characters (Elizabeth and Jane Bennett, Darcy and Bingley, even Lydia and Wickham) into one-dimensional drones with not a single interesting speech between them. If the sparkle and charm of 'Pride and Prejudice' are like an ice-cold glass of the finest champagne, 'Death at Pemberley' is like trying to swallow a giant cup of mud.<br /><br />In short, if you love Austen, don't waste your time on this mess. Instead, read the Adam Dalgleish books that James actually excels at.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's fun and addicting! It makes the time go by fast when you have nothing to do. It's a very relaxing game
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I can't say enough about this album.  Cher gives us a fantastic and fresh album full of dance beats and includes some disco-influenced EDM tracks that take you back and if thats not enough, Cher throws in some of her best ballad wizardry in years.<br /><br />My personal favorite track on the album is the beautiful ballad, originally performed by Nell Bryden, \\"Sirens,\\" - Cher does an incredible job vocally and theres a softness and delicacy in her delivery of this song that I've never heard before from her.  This song absolutely must be a single.<br /><br />The stand-out dance tracks \\"Take It Like A Man,\\" \\"Red,\\" and \\"Dressed to Kill\\" teeter the line between current EDM and sprinkles of disco and 80's. What's interesting is that I was so excited to get this album to hear all the EDM/Dance tracks, that Cher has become known for since the \\"Believe\\" era, but I've been leaning towards the beautiful ballads that really remind me how powerful her voice is.<br /><br />The second single from the album, \\"I Hope You Find It\\" also produced by Mark Taylor is another stand-out.  The song was originally released by Miley Cyrus a few years back. I'm hoping radio supports this beautiful crossover track.  Cher absolutely killed it.  Also happy to see the magical \\"Haven't Seen the Last of Me\\" (more Mark Taylor magic from the Burlesque era) show up on this album.<br /><br />Now, to be objective and not just talk about the positives, Im going to say my least favorite song on the album is, \\"I Don't Have to Sleep to Dream\\" which is thankfully only on the deluxe version and not the regular.  My main gripe with the track stems from the demo sounding production work from Timbaland/J-Roc.  Cher's vocals sound wonderful as does the melody while the beat sounds half-baked...best way to describe it.  I think enhancing the piano sounding elements and the bass could have easily turned this into a hot track.<br /><br />Some interesting tidbits - Cher worked with Jake Shears (Scissor Sisters) on \\"Take it Like A Man\\" though I can't hear him at all.  Cher worked with P!nk on \\"Lie To Me\\" and \\"I Walk Alone\\" and lastly \\"Lovers Forever\\" was originally written in 1994 for the \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" soundtrack but was rejected by the films decision makers.<br /><br />Here are some more of the production/writing credits for each track.  I've also ordered the track from favorite to least favorite.<br /><br />\\"Sirens\\" - Mark Taylor<br />\\"Favorite Scars\\" - TMS<br />\\"I Hope You Find It\\" - Jeffrey Steele/Mark Taylor<br />\\"Red\\" - Josh Crosby<br />\\"Lovers Forever\\" - Mark Taylor<br />\\"Take It Like a Man\\" - Mark Taylor/Tim Powell<br />\\"Pride\\" - Carl Ryden<br />\\"I Walk Alone\\" - P!nk/Billy Mann/MachoPsycho<br />\\"My Love\\" - Mark Taylor<br />\\"Dressed to Kill\\" - Mark Taylor<br />\\"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me\\" (Original Version) - Diane Warren/Mark Taylor<br />\\"Woman's World\\" - Paul Oakenfold<br />\\"Lie to Me\\" - P!nk/Billy Mann<br />\\"I Don't Have to Sleep to Dream\\" - Timbaland/J-Roce it Like A Man\\" though I can't hear him at all.  Cher worked with P!nk on \\"Lie To Me\\" and \\"I Walk Alone\\" and lastly \\"Lovers Forever\\" was originally written in 1994 for the \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" soundtrack but was rejected by the films decision makers.<br /><br />Here are some more of the production/writing credits for each track.

B00A83075M|4.0|Got this for the teenagers, and we had a great time watching it.  The story is odd, the characters fairly original.  This is not a movie that I can watch over and over, but once every few years would be ok.
B0052GACNM|5.0|No matter your age or music preferences you gotta love this CD. Viewing the DVD will surely convince the nay sayers.<br />The chemistry, talent and professionalism of Tony Bennett along with todays young talent is a must see!<br />I purchased the CD only so I can listen to it in the car. I highly recommend both. Well worth the money...
B00F1RR3Y8|5.0|Per my 6 year old: it was easy to understand, she will play it again.  She would tell her friends to play it.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Very pleased with this movie, the characters are able to give you a feel of the original series, the language was almost decent, and you only had to endure a couple of brief seductive scenes.  The plot brought back some memories from the past and the action and effects were great!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|The movie basicly drags on with no real story to identift too. Same old format with realy bad writing and screenplay.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|George Harrison is a phenomenal artist.  I would have bought the album if What Is Life and My Sweet Lord were all that were on it.  Happily, there is even more awesome music on it.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is such an incredible story, and very well told. If this was a work of fiction, it would be entertaining enough. The fact that it is all true will blow you away. I have no idea how I had never heard of it before a friend told me I had to watch it. It's a story that must get out there! I'm not usually a movie buyer, I just watch once and I'm done. This is one I can't wait to get out over and over again to share with friends unfamiliar with this amazing story.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|The filtering, frames, and matting are incredible.<br />Don't know why people are having trouble accessing pics--the app saves in its own file and I can see it within my phone's gallery AND in a File Manager app like Astro or Solid Explorer (Galaxy Note 2).<br />Other than Samsung's Photo Editor (due to the S-Pen features), this is the go-to app. Get S-Pen functionality and it will become the primary one!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Great combo pack for the price! You can get it from Redbox but that won't include all the special features like deleted scenes and commentary. I definitely want to get the sound track as well!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This show is aimed at adults, not the typical sitcom aimed at 12 year-olds.  My wife and I look forward every week to see what crisis will arise with this crazy group.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Cast contracts seemed to determine the story line. Can't imagine why the actors would not come back for season 4. I hope there is a season 5 and 6 bringing the estate through the depression and WWII
B000IDEORY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and I have watched it every time it was on television. I can watch  this movie over and over. It is an excellent movie.
B005544TRQ|3.0|A good watch.  Give it a try you'll probably like too.  You don't have much to lose.  I'll be back for more.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|It was like watching a home movie from the 50's. The worst quality download from anywhere. Cable, Dish, Direct, Netflix. They all have Prime beat. Prime is not worth the money. If all you do with prime is order a bunch of books...maybe. Just don't get for the video. Not worth it.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I really like zombie movies and t.v. shows, Walking Dead in particular, and this movie was a disappointment overall. The zombies are fast moving with superhuman abilities so some of the scenes were interesting but not &#34;believable&#34; as far as movies of this nature go.<br />The story line was also rather weak in my opinion (rabies is the closest description to the pandemic given).<br />Expected much better.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Very low load times. Graphics are smooth and consistent. I will enjoy the game when I need a short break.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I freakin loooooooooooove this cd. It is my first purchase of Five Finger Death Punch and I have to say that I was blown away!! I listen to it every single morning to get my day started in a proper way!! I havent been this excited about a really good bad since DEAD AGAIN came out by Type O Negative. FFDP has their own metal sound and it is awesome!!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|it is very similar to Mario. downloaded it for my nephews to play and they love it.  I would recommend this if you like Mario
B008OM0EDO|3.0|It's the last thing I have to watch then I guess i'll watch it... If you want to be entertained then, there you go...
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|downloaded the app  for my nephews 11 and 5 they both like playing the game, they say it is easy and fun
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I didn't see \\"World War Z\\" in theaters, so some of the sound and visual effects were probably lost. However, it was a decent zombie flick that kept the action moving. It lacked much of a story, which was disappointing because the book was excellent. I didn't expect it to be as good as the book, and I hate when people complain about movies not living up to written word. They still could have tried a bit harder on the story, though.<br /><br />Still worth a rent for a weeknight in.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The characters are well developed.  The author really makes you feel empathy for all the characters.  She pulls you and makes you a part of their lives.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|If you loved Ender's Game, be warned.... this one is much more philosophical and less action packed. This didn't bother me in the slightest, however, and read almost non-stop until I reached the end. Orson Scott Card officially has me hooked.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Got this recently as the free app of the day it is an extremely useful very easy to use, I'm able to integrate all of my calendars including my wifes calendar into mine so I can keep track of everything and adding things to the schedule is a breeze.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very interesting- if a bit bleak- take on humanity's future. Couldn't put it down. I was worried it would be a bit too childish, but quickly realized my fears were unnecessary.
B007P06DOK|5.0|I listen to this CD over and over and never get tired of it.  More than any other album or collection of songs, I just love the music.  It makes me happy.  The lyrics are quirky and memorable.  Paul Simon is a genius, including how he put everyone and everything together to make it happen.  The music has its own soul and his soul has everything to do with it.  His words create images that you can't forget -- imagine every time you see a New York license plate you think of human trampolines na na nah na.  What a way to see the world!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|We don't have a blue-ray, but we use digital and DVD movies. We were able to give the blue-ray as a gift and keep the other versions. Super price!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I can never stop reading a Jack Reacher book. this one is no exception. Can't wait for the next one.
0061122416|5.0|This is a great insightful book. The parable is relatable and multi-dimensional. It can be read to children as a storybook, and re-read  later in life.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Stop charging so much for main characters, make it easier to add friends, non of my Facebook friends will add the game and I don't know how to add them off game loft. Discouraging and disappointed, such potential and such an awesome game.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|It just keeps getting better. Action packed but easy to watch. Good acting and good plot. I did not expect the movie to be as good as it was. I would definitely watch it again.
B00181JGI2|5.0|I do not know how anyone cannot like this movie. The story just keeps on going like a freight train! Things get unraveled, then get obscured, comically dark twists and turns just have you hooked! &#34;The Dude&#34; is forever immortalized in this classic story of how the Big Lebowski tries to screw us all over in some form or another because of who we are!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Though I will always Like the Star Trek shows, I loved Stargate the movie and Atlantis has been my favorite since The Next Generation went off the air.  You almost could call this the next gen.  as it is the 2nd show of the SG1.  I like the characters better.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Action, guns, gore, nudity, and MACHETES! It's not a deep and thought provoking film, its just a simple story of revenge with the whirlwind of chaos and mayhem intertwined with some other minor story lines. I absolutely love the cast! I'd have to say, just like those Scary Movie movies, what piqued my interest was the range of cast members from Robert DeNiro to Lindsay Lohan. Plus, I always liked Danny Trejo, and was glad to see him in his own movie!<br /><br />This is just that stereotypical &#34;GUY&#34; movie, action, violence, and nudity! But its done to perfection with this one!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love this game. I have no problems while playing this. Any age can play this. Something the whole family can play.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|If you're a fan of Eminem and Royce 5'9 lyricism, this album surely won't disappoint. The lyrical wordplay, flows, and the purely symbiotic delivery this duo throws down is amazing! The production is also very incredible, I have to say that whenever I listen to this album, I listen to it all the way through.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Yes, the movie, and the zombies in it, were nothing like this book. And, the movie seemed to cut too short, like half a story was told without an ending. But, having watched the movie first made reading this book a lot more enjoyable for two reasons.<br />  First, it gave both closure and a greater overall view of WWZ. We got to see the survivors and their stories and perspectives about the beginning, middle, end, and rebuilding afterwards. And the movie itself seemed to fit in as just one of those stories.<br />  And second, it wasn't just a book that went chapter after chapter following one main character. It was easy to pick up, read one or more characters' story, then put down without the feeling that you are leaving off in the middle of a story. So, for the readers who can't drudge through a long book without getting bored, this is a great read that you can walk away from when you can't sit down for a long period of time and read.<br />  Overall, it was a good book in a style that is unique and refreshing from all the other books on the market today.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|One day my friend was at my house and saw it was the free app of the day.( that was several days ago)  She said it was awesome and that I should get it. At first I thought she was crazy, but got it any way. After I played a few levels, I fell in love with this app!!! It is awesome.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|This is a wonderful new mix of songs from Norah Jones. I have been playing it a lot lately. Good Stuff.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Great special effect and a comedic hard core gore take on a classic.  I'd definitely watch it again.  Look forward to the sequel.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this book quite a while back. I should have reviewed it then. But I didn't...because the reason I read it was because a friend told me the story of Hugh Howey and his success as an indie author. And as soon as I read the book, I realized how much better is was than most traditionally published books. I was inspired to then publish my own book that had been sitting on my computer for years. So I got a little busy. While I was in the middle of that, I had to read Shift. And as soon as that was done, I started reading other books by other self-published authors like Michael Bunker, etc. All while waiting for Dust to come out. Then I learned about all the fan fiction in the Wool world. I can't get enough. All because of Wool. This book started it all. High Howey created a world unlike any other I've ever experienced when reading. Many have classified this as sci-fi. I would agree to some extent, but it is so much more than that. The world may be sci-fi, but the stories are so much more. Wool is well-written, characters are well-developed, and the story is amazing. I couldn't possibly recommend this book more. I only wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Loved the book for the ideas that get you to take action to change your life. Enjoy the humor also .
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Like game. The colors are bright and the game is easy and fast.. Sorry I do not have nine more words. thanks.
B000FC0ZAI|4.0|I ordered this book thinking it was the the book version of the movie--silly me! Since the film story was so tripped out, I was well into the novel before I was certain that I purchased the 'wrong' book. However, it was a great read in its own right. I loved the mystical allusions--particularly as they pertained to the native people's of the region. Living in Seattle, I'm about as far north as I care to be, and travel is usually to sunnier, more southerly climes. But I did enjoy this adventure up north very much! Well-written, great characters, and an interesting take on WW2 history.
B00622D3BS|4.0|Tried this on a whim and was so glad we watched it, well written and acted. Ryan Gosling was a real stand out for his dry humor and Steve Carol was his usual mix of charm and sweetness. Though nothing touches his performance in Little Miss Sunshine.
B005GRTNXC|4.0|I wish Leona could become a bigger star in America.  I love her voice and her song choices are really good.  I love this album.
B008M721MS|5.0|I remember rotary phones!  And taking phone calls from America when we lived in Australia.  You would hear the other person in an echo, and hear yourself talking twice.  What a mess.  And expensive!  Skype is so much better for keeping in touch with friends and family around the world.  On a tablet, however, the picture quality is a bit blurry and it's hard not to get just part of your face in the picture. So there's room for improvement but overall, it has to be the best thing since the wheel or something.  (Ok, I don't remember that far back.)
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Harry Bosch returns to assist his step brother in this possible serial kidnapper, and killer. The ending leaves one completely pleased that justice prevails at times in unusual consequences.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|&#34;i have always used Google on my desk CPU so I decided to use it on my Kindle. Thank you !
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Okay, the movie didn't make much sense, but it was fascinating enough that I just allowed myself to enjoy it without needing to understand what was going on. Anyway, I thought if I read the book after I could piece it all together.<br />The characters are interesting, and I really liked the futuristic parts. But it was a long, slow, arduous journey to the end--which is why I've only given it two stars. This is not a stupid book--just more work than I wanted to put into it for what I came out with.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved it so much,I read it for more than 3 hours straight. I could read it all day long
B003PVPXOE|5.0|Acting, not special effects makes these good old movies so much better. I really love this kind of story telling.
0307271609|5.0|Jung Chang has written a scholarly, readable, and vastly interesting biography of Empress Dowager Cixi who ruled China for over four decades in the late 19th century. This remarkable woman spent her life trying to modernize and improve the lives of the Chinese people. According to the author, Cixi \\"brought in modernity to replace decrepitude, poverty, and savagery and absolute power and she introduced hitherto untasted humaneness, open-mindedness and freedom.\\" This book details her struggles and accomplishments. Cixi was chiefly responsible for China's entrance into the modern world by instituting policies that built railways, telecommunications networks, modern shipping, and other infrastructures. She introduced educational and cultural reforms that erased China's xenophobic views of the world. I agree with the author that \\"one cannot but admire this amazing stateswoman, flawed though she was.\\"<br />Empress Dowager Cixi not only details Cixi's accomplishments but it also describes China's culture of tradition and servitude. As I read the book, I couldn't help but count my blessings that I live in a country with a constitution that spells out the powers and duties of those who govern while at the same time safeguarding the rights of those who are governed.
B00132S74A|4.0|Good read with great detail. Story is a little weak. No single military asset would be given that much authority.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Reacher wins.  He always wins.  A little too tidy, but a good first effort for Child.  A good read.  Entertaining, but few surprises.
B00DOPEGAS|1.0|We purchased this item for our daughters. Not even an adult could follow some of the directions. I would not recommend this to any one
1446301583|5.0|Love this book!  So many fun projects to make!  Wonderful photography and instructions.  Tone is a very talented designer.  This is one of her best books.
B000PMG16U|5.0|The only bad thing I can say about buying these movies is that the movies suck. I just wanted to have the collection together in one set and that's all I could ask for.
0307476073|5.0|I'm a Californian who has enjoyed hiking, including parts of the PCT.  Although I did some backpacking as a Senior Girl Scout, I would not choose to repeat the experience. I admire Cheryl for her spunk, persistence, and determination.  She was able to reach her goal, in spite of the many obstacles she encountered along the route, and the physical exhaustion and pain.  She had the courage to go out into the unknown, alone, in spite of her lack of wilderness experience.  I was happy for the interesting people she met, and that they became instant mentors and soul mates.  I enjoyed the humor, the descriptions of the scenic beauty, and the stories of her  relationships with family and lovers -  even of the dysfunctional aspects of her background.  She was foolish, but also wise, and along the way, her heart was healed.  WILD was selected by the women of my book club, and there has been enthusiastic response.  I have been recommending it to my daughters and friends.
0374214913|4.0|This book may be best thought of as an affectionate quasi-thriller. The stakes are very low -- some oddball characters are trying to solve a mystery in an old bookshop, and the clerk teams with some friends at Google to pursue the answer by novel means. None of the major characters think the world is going to be changed by their work, and this de-escalation of the stakes from the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" or \\"National Treasure\\" allows Robin Sloan to have fun with his characters without seeming flippant. Some of them seem likely to be based on people Sloan knows in real life, and he treats them all with a light touch and fond humor.<br /><br />The mystery feels real, but the techniques used to solve it amount roughly to \\"failed magic,\\" then \\"physically improbable nonsense.\\" It doesn't matter, though, the book is about a young man in San Francisco, who meets an attractive young woman and flirts with her over three dimensional modeling in Ruby. The main character and his male friends feel real, and don't take themselves too seriously. At one point, the narrator comments on his love interest by saying \\"I am really into the kind of girl you can impress with a prototype.\\" Hah! The female characters and the older characters are less believable, but by the time this might be a problem, the book has established itself as basically a lark, so it doesn't matter.<br /><br />As a first novel especially, this is a clear success.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|A good read and ending to the story of these two complex characters.  Entertaining.  The story and character development became much more interesting than the intimacy.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Not a great movie but a good zombie movie that is a little different take on previous movies.<br /><br />Worth a watch.
B004EPZ0H0|4.0|This was not an easy read. I enjoyed the story of Henrietta's life and that of her family. The sections about the scientific &#34;stuff&#34; was more difficult to wade through and understand. This is not my usual type of book but I am glad I read it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I got it for my nephew and I to play at the beach one summer when it was raining and we stayed inside. We had hours of fun and really enjoyed killing some zombies with the creative plants. They did a really good job on this game.
B007ZYABW6|5.0|The book is fascinating and captivating! The ordeals that those men went through are incredible. Everyone should read this book.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I like Bruce Willis and his other &#34;Die Hard&#34; movies, but this one seriously &#34;jumps the shark&#34;.  It's as if they had nothing better to do and so just threw this together.<br /><br />No need to pay to see this one.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Everyone should have this on their mobiles/tablets....it's the full Facebook version and it's great!! Easy to use, a bit slow in places but great to use :-)
B004FGMDOQ|1.0|It defiantly wasn't my favorite book it was hard book for me, their was a lot of pics and a lot of big words.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Fantastic little app that does an amazing job of freeing up memory and very quickly.  Thanks for this super helpful tool.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|I love these movies and I love having the entire collection all together. It was well worth it and I am happy I bought them.
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|Their first levels were not too difficult but still challenging. I have enjoyed this game over others that I have tried.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I downloaded this for my kids to play and I enjoy playing it. It is very addicting. Love flipping the car.
B00985E3UG|5.0|This is a well researched and interesting book. The secrecy, deception and sometimes downright lies from the food industry is deeply disturbing. No-one seems to give a hoot about our health, just about their products. Since finishing this book, I've dramatically cut down on any processed food, because, as this book will tell you, it's not really food.<br /><br />To sum up, I think this book should be a mandatory read at schools all over the country.<br /><br />Essential reading.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse isn't the best of gaming mice, but it is perfect for me. You can change the lighting of the logo, and even turn that off if it bothers you. You can also change the weight of it to fit your needs. Changing sensitivity of the mouse is also easy as pushing a button and you can program the buttons through their utility. Installation is a snap as well.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Well designed, you will want to spend hours just to level up. The environments are well crafted. The battle system is fun and not that repetitive. Highly recommended.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I loved the SG-1 series and I have really enjoyed all the series that came after it. This was a great conclusion to the story and I was really glad to get to see it.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I realize some of the characters are given dialogue and actions not necessarily totally in concert with history, because much of that time is not recorded entirely acupcurately. But when read as a combination of history and entertainment, and in concert with watching the new series on Starz TV, &#34;The White Princess&#34; I really enjoyed this. I did find it necessary to read all of the rest of the surrounding books -and to continually look up the family trees and pictures in Wikipedia to keep track of everybody. These ages had so many people with the same names, and they moved around so much in families and allegiances! But a great book, written well, as well as the rest of this series.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps on my phone, I'm glad they also brought it to the Kindle. The amount of content that you get is absolutely mind-boggling, and even better...it's free! For a language-learning app of this quality, I could easily imagine paying at least $10 for a single language, but this lets you learn 5 and all you have to spend is your time. As others have mentioned though, there are some nuances to the languages that can be difficult to acquire if you're just using Duolingo, but I do feel like it gives you a fantastic foundation in the languages. My only advice for the developers: please please please add in Japanese! If you do I will go straight to your site and donate. I love the variety of languages so far but it'd be great to have some of the Asian languages such as Chinese, Russian, maybe even Arabic! Anyways, to the potential consumer out there: get this app, you'll be far from disappointed!
B006JSXYPA|2.0|This is one of those films that is fun enough to watch, but pretty badly plotted and acted.<br />Sometimes, there is so much going on, on-screen that it looks like someone has thrown a bunch of old gears and car parts on the screen and just shook them around. One thing that you can say is that it's something of an assault on the senses!<br />However, it's also a pretty rubbish story, the actors seem to understand that they are in a not very good film and it just loses it's fun because of that.<br />Maybe one to keep the kids happy?<br />Having said that, at times, the special effects are stunning and for that, it's at least interesting to look at.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I'm 54 and I play these games all the time, I've played big fish, alawar, and too many others, this is a good one. It's worth 3$'  I hope they come out with another one., I like the fact that it had the black crow in it! One of the top ten games I've played so far
B00B22ASUM|5.0|LOVED this book.  What a terrific story and what a smart cat.  This man was so sweet to save that cat, feed him and keep him well.  The cat saved his life as well----great story.
B009JBZH54|5.0|These movies are classic. Some people even think of The Dark Knight as one of the best movies that have ever been made. I don't know if I would go that far but it is a great movie. It is the best in the series and Heath Ledger is amazing as the Joker. I wish he was still with us.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I Think This App Is The Best! :) I Play This Game Everyday! I Also Have It On My Phone! I Just  Wish That You Don't Have To Have A Facebook To Get New Friends. But I Love This Game! ADD ME!!! LAN7W LEAVE A LIKE AND I'LL LIKE YOU BACK! ;D
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun but it needs more levels.  It's very challenging and different from the other games.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|This is without question the best mystery novel that I have read in years and I read a great many mystery novels. It is really 3 novels in 1 because just when you think that you know where the book is headed, it changes course. Then it does it again. And then the ending is completely brilliant. It is a book that you have to go back and re-read because there is no way for you to see that everything that is happening is important for a different reason than what you thought.<br />Brilliant to the nth degree. Why can't more writers write books that are this good?<br />If you read one mystery novel in your life, let it be this book.
B00F35BV64|5.0|It was even better than I anticipated. Enjoyed every minute. The casting was perfect and the action was fast and nonstop.
B008KHRODG|5.0|I'm sure by now everyone knows these episodes mark the end of David Tennant's time as the Doctor and Russell T. Davies time as show runner.  This is a wonderful set, a must own for any fan of Doctor Who. That being said I have two warnings for people who want to buy this set.<br /> 1) These are some of the most depressing episodes of  Doctor Who or any series I've ever watched. Tennant's Doctor stole my heart and then broke it quite a few times, especially in these final episodes. During &#34;The Next Doctor&#34; and &#34;Planet Of The Dead&#34; it's not so bad. &#34;The Waters Of Mars&#34; shows a darker side of The Doctor but then he just gets sad again and it bums me out. &#34;The End Of Time&#34; episodes are brilliant but the end of part 2 is heart wrenching so if you're emotionally unstable like I am, beware.<br />*Also I would have preferred having the last two episodes on the same disc. I think that would have made more sense and disc 5 could have been nothing but extras but what do I know.<br />2) The price. If you're thinking of buying this newer slim box version you're financially challenged like I am, be patient. The price drops down to $20 something fairly often. I ended up paying $39 only to see the price drop a couple days later. I was aware of this but let impatience get the best of me. Just a warning.<br />Yes, it's sad to see Tennant go but it was inevitable. I'm more bothered that this was it for Russell Davies. I certainly hope this review helps someone.<br />Edit 2017: I'm not sure how accurate my tip about the pricing is anymore. I just wanted to add that the series was never quite the same after RTD left and for me this was not a good thing at all. The new showrunner really botched things up during the Smith years and things only slightly imprived during Capaldi's tenure. If you're not a fan of Moffat's fairy tale, catchphrase, taglines instead of plots, writing I recommend stopping here altogether or skipping ahead to Capaldi's stuff. Nothing against Matt Smith but his last two seasons don't even feel like Doctor Who. Four yeats later and these specials are still a great yet depressing end to the wonderful work of RTD.is last two seasons don't even feel like Doctor Who. Four yeats later and these specials are still a great yet depressing end to the wonderful work of RTD.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|These movies are classic and a wonderful buy. So glad to have a great set of movies like these in my collection. Great buy.
B00CSYR432|5.0|I was waiting for this movie for so long!!! I loved it. I'm a huge fan of Studio Ghibli. Very nice movie.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love this game! I love this game! I love this game!Wow I know that I have been saying the same thing over and over but it's so fun
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really, really wanted to love this book.  After hearing from countless people that reading this was a must, I finally caved in and bought it.  Yes, there's a lot of sex and it delivered there; however, I got so tired of reading these scenes I started glossing over them.  I realize it's a book but there were some parts that were just too much.  Stop reading now as I describe one scene which just grossed me out!  What man on Earth would ever remove a woman's tampon so he could have sex????  How is that supposed to be sexy???  The underlying cause for Grey's obsession with dominance stems from him engaging in a sexual relationship with a &#34;Mrs. Robinson&#34; type when he was 15 years old?  The author portrays &#34;Mrs. Robinson&#34; as someone who &#34;saves&#34; Grey from a family life which sought perfection.  As if that is a fate worse than being preyed upon by a pedophile?  Again, this is just wrong.  The author uses the same terminology and style over and over and over.  I lost count as to the number of times Anastasia bites her lip which apparently is the key to turning Grey on.  What man also says &#34;I'm going to take you now&#34;?  This phrase is repeated countless times as well.  By the middle of the book I really began to dislike Grey.  The domineering and stalking are not attractive characteristics for any one.  There's just too much wrong with the book and left me no desire to read the rest of the series.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is an addicting game and fun,there's lots to do. You'll have hours of play time and a lot to explore in all the levels.
B001QK91TY|4.0|If you like the old style jazz this is the ticket to the product<br />Brings back wonderful  memories of the old time musicians
B000UR9T82|5.0|These were all really good movies and I enjoyed watching them in theaters. It was great to get the whole set of them in one box.
0553801473|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loved it. I dont think he put it down unless he was working or sleeping. well worth the money spent

B008JD7VZM|4.0|Although I ordered LEGO Minecraft Original and LEGO Minecraft World each, ended up receiving both LEGO Minecraft Micro World, the same item. Can't be bothered changing or returning, not exactly as expected!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sweet and sweet. Sweet game. This game is awesome. Sweet. Who ever made this game nice job. Subway Surfers Suck. Just kidding :)
B00F35BV64|3.0|It was aiiight.  Some decent action and the Kahn character was interesting.  The rest was a mild gay love fest between Kirk and Spock, Kirk and Scotty, etc...at one point Spock is crying...a bit too much for me.  A few times people talk about how awesome of a legend Kirk is, but at this point in his career he hasn't really done anything yet.<br /><br />The previous movie was much better.  This one is ok to watch if your killing time.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I have downloaded and re-downloaded this app and for some reason it isn't loading all the way, So I haven't played the game yet to really give you a good review yet...
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|easy to setup and use<br />good concept - but disappointed that it only works with Nertflix, YouTube and a few other<br />want it also to support other commonly used applications - eg HBO, MetOpera, etc
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I chose this rating because it is exciting, action packed, romantic, and pure awesome!!  I did not dislike anything but I liked EVERYTHING.  I recommend this book to people interested in excitement, action, romance, and pure awesome!!

B004SIIBGU|5.0|I would recommend this app for anyone who buys and sells on eBay. A+++. And what could be better than free.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Their best album in years. Perfectly sequenced from track to track this disc has no weak spots. Mangini has found a home with this recording, and each member's musical voice is clearly heard throughout.
B00DGGIXS6|1.0|I was looking forward to something more than auto tune and forced dance songs... no such luck. This is a play once collection and put it away... far away. Why this woman chooses not to evolve and grow as an artist baffles me. This is poor.
B005CWRB44|5.0|I thought long and hard between a keychain light and a smaller light with a pocket clip, and after considering how much I usually end up carrying in my pocket, this was a sure choice. As bright as you would ever need for regular, everyday use. Light yet rigid construction makes it easy to forget about and even easier to not worry about damage. It is simple to operate, and for a light like this, a mode or pressure switch would just add weight or complicate a very streamline light.<br /><br />From working on the car to trying to find that thing that fell behind the desk and everything in between, this light does the job well.
B001O03NCW|5.0|I love all the many songs I got in the mp3 album for only like $5.. pretty cool! I would recommend!
B003NX76BM|5.0|Love Nora Roberts.  Always a different look at interesting professions.  Choosing her books always insures a good read.  Romance, intrigue, with well defined characters.
B001EBWISG|5.0|I would say pound for pound some of the finest actors in the world.If you like gansta movies this is one for the library.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The device is great if you use Google products (movies from Google Play) and watch lots of YouTube. Otherwise it can be a disappointment.<br /><br />The Chromecast device streams wirelessly from your device to the TV. The downside is that if you have Amazon Prime the device is unusable unless you stream from a laptop or desktop. Using a laptop or desktop with Google Chrome browser you can stream anything to the TV but you lose clarity. I believe it streams at 720 vs full 1080.<br /><br />Chromecast I believe was designed to better monetize Google products. Example, to stream a movie, you can stream via Google Play vs. Amazon or other movie providers where it won't work on a mobile device. For me, I have a desktop with a TV a few feet away. I can &#34;cast&#34; via my Google browser. But if I go downstairs with my Xoom or iPad, then I'm stuck with YouTube or movies from Google Play, which I don't believe offer any freebies.<br /><br />Lastly, signal strength. The Roku has better signal strength. I tried both in a back bedroom with a weak WIFI signal. Chromecast cannot pick up the signal. The Roku can. As an FYI, the Chromecast works as follows --- when you click on a URL in say YouTube, Chromecast is sending the URL to your router and receiving the signal, thus the 1080 playback and better signal. When you click on a URL using the browser and a desktop then the call is made to the router but the video is streamed from desktop to TV, thus 720 playback.<br /><br />I understand why Google created this. I don't blame them. Just understand the limitations. It would be easy for this device to &#34;cast&#34; any URL but that defeats Google's purpose of monetizing their assets. Hopefully someone can come along and provide a low cost device that can stream content wirelessly from the Net.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I pre-orderred this is April. when i got it-- i put aside a whole evening thinking (usually)  i would not be able to put this down--oh i did-- several times- now im just .... i don't know MAD at my own expectations waiting this whole time for this book.  Beware-- i may have unintentional spoilers in here.<br /><br />It's like a really bad amalgamation of some young adult/twilight/hunger games pop young fiction or something-- it's AWFUL. How can this be? What happened to his imagination? It's dull, without the name STEPHEN KING I would NEVER have believed he wrote this---- the man is brilliant-- yes there were some bad eggs here and there- but overall-- BRILLIANT.<br /><br />Seriously-- this is nothing like the SHINING (that i re-read recently) -I did NOT expect it to be the SHINING- i expected more of a sequel what happened to Danny etc-- this was a stand alone book-- and pretty bad if it were the first one i read. He had a couple of references to Dick H and Mom/Wendy nd of course memories from the Overlook(these do not make a proper sequel or whatever you are calling this.)  I felt nothing for Danny in this book-- I felt nothing for ANY of the characters--- this is crucial-- bc if anything Stephen King makes us CONNECT.  I didn't care about them-- any of them.  The 'bad\\" characters were so NOT scary- the \\"good one's\\" were hardly interesting,  without character and frankly i could barely remember them WHILE i was still reading the book!<br /><br />I thought the storyline was lame- the characters including Danny totally THIN and underdeveloped- really not one redeeming point to this book at all.<br /><br />This will make some people mad but to me this was almost like Stephen King writing a book while really REALLY wanting to have a drink-- (yes i know he's an alcoholic as are many of his characters including Jack Torrance) I was so annoyed by all the AA stuff-- at least in the Shining you could really see the how SCARY alcoholism or the drying out can be etc-- but this had nothing-- it was an AA manual of BOREDOM-- not even a good rock bottom.<br /><br />This is Stephen KIng-- and it's  just not creepy,  or scary, pull the blankets over your head-- wake up with noises that may or may not be there-- nothing......  the worst thing i can say -- and it IS the worst thing--- i was BORED. and couldn't wait for it to end.<br /><br />I have read everything-- everything by mr. King since is was a kid-several over and over- and i hate hate hate to say this.<br /><br />- it's just not horror -- or HIS old horror anymore. I guess the letdown is so much worse since i was looking forward to this for SO SO LONG.  I have factored that in.<br /><br />I don't understand all the great reviews-- this book was TERRIBLE.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Saw it when it came out - lots of my favorite actors and actress. Had to add it to my collection. Great humor and action. Looking forward to Red2.
B005K17RU0|4.0|One of the difficulties with the Kindle Fire is the lack of instructions. So the app was a bit difficult to navigate.  It has good weather details.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|IT IS VERY FUN TO PLAY ,BUT I THI K THEY SHOULD BE FREE .BECAUSE THEY ARE LONG ENOUGH FOR THE PRICE.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Perfect to put on my nightstand every night! It is 100% worth the $0.99.  Try it out! You won't be disappointed.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Great movie!! I went into it not knowing anything about it and enjoyed every minute. My 11-year old son was also intrigued with the special effects.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I like the fact that I can navigate and select both Netflix and YouTube video on any of my devices -- phone and tablet.  I can hardly wait for more applications to support chromecasting.

B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|What I love most about the King's of Leon is there songs pertain to so many different moods I find myself in. This album was one I have been waiting for for quite some time now, since Come Around Sundown was released in 2010. I can say truthfully that it does not disappoint, it delivers on every level. From country-esque sounding songs, to bluesy guitar riffs. This is everything I hoped for in the anxiously awaited return of one of my favorite bands.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|I bought this movie as a joke because my dad had it on LasorVision when I was growing up.  You can estimate my age by that statment alone.  Watching it brought back all kinds of memories and I was shocked to see who was in it.  All I can say is &#34;Flash ahhh, he saved everyone of us!&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I changed my mind. At first, I had this game as a one star on my Kindle fire. That was before I knew it needed WiFi while it was loading. After I figured that out, I finally got to play the game, and it is awesome. It's so much like subway surfers and temple run but only better. I like this game it deserves a five star. Plus it doesn't need WiFi in order to play. I'm especially glad for that.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|I was a bit skeptical upon hearing that the classic movie was going to be remade. It's an OK movie, though no actor will ever surpass Bruce Campbell: not that the movie try to do that. This movie takes itself seriously. Overall the movie tend to adhere to mythos established in the original movie: but there are some departures...Sam Raimi's car appear in there. Overall it's all right: as long as you do not expect a genuine Sam Raimi movie.
B0047DVHV2|5.0|As a Stones fan for more than three decades, I wondered what this latest instalment in the band's story was going to offer. What did it offer? Wow, what didn't it...<br /><br />Funny, honest, humble story-telling from a man who knows what it feels like to shoulder the burden of rock stardom on shoulders never designed for the task. This is the compelling story of the shy, pimply little Dartford kid who learnt to fuse the sounds of Chicago Blues and St Louis Rock and Roll, and created his own genre of music in the process. Keith put new sounds on the blank canvas that was silence. He invented new colours of music. New sounds. New notes. New rhythms. The Human Riff. And while he stumbled a few times, the inner strength of the man never faltered. It's all in this book.<br /><br />By now, if you're a Stones fan, you should have read it. If not - do it. And even if you're not a Stones fan; if you're mystified and miffed by the kohl-eyed heroin addled guitar player; puzzled by the \\"man most likely to die\\", but still kicking; if you were angered by the sexuality and suggested Satanism of the Rolling Stones; if you love Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow character and want to discover it's roots; if you've every swayed your hips to the sound of great rock music; if you think you've lived an interesting life yourself ... then you need to read this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This continues to be an excellent series. Every character is richly developed with a storyline full of twists and turns. Not typically a fan of this time period, I have been surprisingly enthralled since season 1. The costumes are magnificent!

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|an enjoyable movie with non stop action and a good plot by having Thor fight against his brother Lokei.  Watch it.
B0052Z3IZC|4.0|Not for the faint hearted, or those easily offended, this book features cutting prose. Squirm-inducing. Laugh-out-loud. Thought-provoking. Though I'd heard about this story before I read it for myself, I didn't know what exactly to expect ... and then received it in spades. That's the delight of this book. Uncertainty meets absurdity. It's certainly not your average story.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This is the kind of app that keeps you entertained whenever you need it. At the Dr.'s office, getting a car repair, it's perfect because it's not like other games where you have time sensitive things going on. Just need enough attention to think about it a little bit.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|The film was cute in the way the stories merged in an interesting way. Sometimes humorous but sometimes more serious.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|[Originally posted on the Arched Doorway]<br /><br />While this isn't the type of book I typically read, (I tend to avoid superhero type books), Brandon Sanderson`s Steelheart is an imaginative, and enjoyable read. Taking place in future Chicago,Steelheart follows David on his quest for revenge, ten years after Steelheart kills his father.<br /><br />While this was an enjoyable read, I found myself not entirely a fan of the characters. The protagonist, David, felt to be too perfect, with no real flaws besides for some awful metaphors (a bit `Mary Sue' in my opinion), The characterization felt weak and a shallow (with only a couple exceptions) compared to many that we see in his other novels, which was a bit disappointing. However, I did enjoy the dynamics between the Reckoners, and as always with Sanderson's works, there's more to them than there seems to be on the surface. There were some great backstories to go along with a couple of the characters.<br /><br />The plot of the book felt a bit formulaic -- being extremely reminiscent of the first Mistborn novel (fans of his other books will feel right at home while reading Steelheart). However, the story had an interesting premise, was well-executed and was a fast-paced story. And as with all of Sanderson's novels, his world-building skills showed clearly throughout the novel.<br /><br />While this isn't my favourite of his works, Sanderson once again proves himself to be a fantastic writer, painting a vivid picture of a strange new world, with vivid battles and a new magic system. Steelheart was a fun and entertaining read. It's definitely written with a young adult audience in mind. I did enjoy it more than I did his other YA novel, The Rithmatist which came out earlier this year.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Lots have been said about Walt being a bad guy yada yada yada - and yeah, he is - so why do we watch???  I remember the old adage about drama being nothing more than about conflict...and this show brings every one of us to probably more internal conflict than we have ever previously felt.  But I think there's more magic beyond that because we never really knew how conflicted we were until the very end.  In watching the last few episodes, each of us will encounter a point where we finally wake up from what feels in a sense like a trance and realize \\"WOW - Walt really is that bad a dude\\" and totally, \\"How did we end up here???\\"  It's as if we knew we travelled the journey - we remember all that had occurred - but we have zero recollection of how far we had gone.<br /><br />If you want to witness and experience one of the most amazing rides ever and take in some truly ingenious and fabulous writing - strap in and don't look back - you won't regret the ride...
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great suspenseful story! I don't usually like suspense, but this was a great story! I never knew what was going to happen next! That's what I love, very unpredictable.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|World War Z was about what I expected - a large budget, big picture, well executed zombie movie. For that I'll give it 4 stars -- there was nothing about this movie that I found to be truly exceptional, though that might be hard to achieve in this genre.

B003H4I4JU|1.0|I am not sure where to even begin.  I loved Ender's Game and when I saw there were other books I was excited to start reading Speaker for the Dead.  This book bored me from beginning to end.  The story just drags on and on and is predictable in every way.  I have no idea what book everyone who gave this five stars was reading.<br /><br />This book is a sales book for being Catholic. I could not tell you what role religion even played in the story yet it is in there from beginning to end.  Some references were so out of the blue I wanted to through my Kindle across the room.  E.g. &#34;Resurrected like Jesus who died for all of us?&#34;.<br /><br />The setting of the story is a Catholic colony, who knows why, in the depths of space 3,000 years after Ender's Game.  Again, no idea why we are that far into the future.  On this colony they speak Portuguese and English( called Stark, again, no idea why).  The use of Portuguese is another head scratcher.  The author would use the language then immediately translate what was just written. It serves no purpose at all in this book other than to maybe make the book a little longer.  he uses the language to spell out everyone's names which end up being very long.  I truly believe this was done so the book could reach so many pages.<br /><br />Another thing that really bothered me were the characters names.  Pipo, Libo, Miro, Leaf-Eater, piggies, etc....  It is as if the author asked his 4 year old son to come up with names.  Truly lazy writing.<br /><br />The story has no flow, does not go any where.  The whole Speaker for the Dead thing is so beyond stupid that I had to force myself to finish hoping there would be some great ending to make this piece of crud worth while.  Not even close.  Please, save your time and money on this book.  This book is a huge disappointment and I can not believe it was written by the same author.  And again, I have no clue how anyone gave this book a good rating.
B00064WSOQ|5.0|This is supposedly King Crimson's last studio effort, since Robert Fripp announced his retirement from music last year*.  Whether or not he is actually gone for good this time, The Power to Believe feels like a great note to go out on.  It's easily the band's strongest effort since 1981's Discipline, and comfortably stands next to their classic albums while still staying modern and perhaps even futuristic.<br /><br />The overall sound of this album is fairly heavy for the most part; compare to 1974's Red or their previous two efforts.  Tracks like \\"Level Five\\" and \\"Elektrik\\" will be instant favorites of anyone who loves the crunchy guitar tone Fripp uses on those records.  The album's not devoid of subtlety, though; \\"The Power To Believe II\\" reminds more of the softer moments on Larks' Tongues in Aspic, while \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" harkens slightly toward Three of a Perfect Pair (albeit a much better song than anything on that album).  Indeed, this album seems to utilize some aspect or another of just about every King Crimson album before it; it's got the epic instrumentals, the poppier songs, and even the quirky little deep cuts that are somewhere in between.<br /><br />The musicians on this album are as extraordinary as on any past King Crimson release.  Robert Fripp is a guitar god, and his work on this album strongly solidifies that status.  Adrian Belew is often seen as the physical line dividing diehard fans of KC's early work and fans of their work from the 80's onward due to his singing style and occasionally silly lyrics, but it's undeniable that he is one of the few who can stand next to Fripp with guitar in hand and not look idiotic.  Trey Gunn is back with his unusual Warr guitar, which is basically a bass with about three times as many strings, making for some interesting textures.  However, it's Pat Mastelotto who gets the most attention from me, being a drummer myself.  His play style is similar to previous KC drummer Bill Bruford's in that he can take an odd time signature and make it feel very natural.  What sets him apart is his inventive use of electronic drums alongside acoustic ones; sometimes it's difficult to tell which is which.<br /><br />For those who are interested and for the sake of thoroughness, what follows is a track-by-track review.  If you are at all worried about having the album spoiled for you, I would stop reading here.<br /><br />*EDIT: Robert Fripp announced the resurrection of King Crimson the day after I posted this.  It seems I spoke a bit too soon.  :P<br /><br />---------------SPOILER ALERT BAR---------------<br /><br />1.The Power to Believe I: A Cappella - No music, just a short poem sung by Belew that acts as an intro to the album.  This poem is a recurring theme of the album, and appears three more times before the album is over.<br /><br />2.Level Five - This is where the real music starts.  You may have turned the volume up on your stereo a bit to hear the quiet first track better, and if you did you're in for a big surprise, as this song immediately grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go for 7 minutes.  Heavy, angular rhythms are made all the more intriguing by a mixture of electronic and acoustic drums.<br /><br />3.Eyes Wide Open - Vocals and music finally come together.  This is one of King Crimson's \\"poppier\\" songs, but it's not devoid of KC's trademark odd time signatures or progressions.  This is the one you're most likely to find yourself humming subconsciously.<br /><br />4.Elektrik - Another lengthy instrumental and my favorite track on the album.  There is a nice balance of loud and quiet moments on this song that give it a great sense of dynamics.  This is also perhaps the most rhythmically interesting song on the album; the band plows through quite a few time signatures, and Mastelotto gets to show off his hybrid kit.<br /><br />5.Facts of Life: Intro - The extended intro to the next song.  A good cool-down moment after Elektrik.  Sometimes I'm tempted to skip it toget on with the actual song, though.<br /><br />6.Facts of Life - The second \\"pop\\" song (I use this term VERY loosely) starts with Adrian Belew singing in a mock Tom Waits fashion over an 11/4 against 4/4 polyrhythm between drums and guitars.  This is the easiest track to headbang to despite the odd time signatures.  Awesome bridge.<br /><br />7.The Power to Believe II - The song starts off sounding like the sonic representation of walking through a desert while on acid, then morphs into a middle-eastern percussive jam.  The theme poem from the first track makes its second appearance, paving the way for an authentic Fripp guitar solo that floats on top of the wall of percussion, bass, and synth.<br /><br />8.Dangerous Curves - Another slowly building piece.  Starts as a whisper and builds to an explosive ending.  The hypnotic, rhythmic guitar riff is very cool.  Reminds me a lot of \\"The Talking Drum\\" from Larks' Tongues in Aspic.  However, oftentimes I feel that the payoff doesn't live up to the buildup.<br /><br />9.Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With - This song seems to poke fun at modern hard rock and nu metal.  It's a bit \\"love it or hate it\\".  I think it's a good song, but sometimes it feels like too much of a joke.  If there is any single moment that the album loses momentum, it's here.<br /><br />10.The Power to Believe III - The theme poem is back (well, sort of), this time amid a soft cloud of synth, which is occasionally interrupted by a loud electronic drum beat that may make you pee your pants if you have the volume turned up and aren't expecting it.  The song takes a turn for the heavier halfway through with another soaring guitar solo.  Really cool piece, but I wish it was longer, as it seems to end just as it's getting started.<br /><br />11.The Power to Believe IV: Coda - The fourth and final reprise.  The cloud of synth returns more confident than before, and carries the album to a natural conclusion as the central poem is repeated one lasttime.
B0012QLYCO|5.0|This record consumed my brain when it came out in '74.  I was a college freshman.  Nice to reconnect with it.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I got this as a gift for my son since he is a big fan of Back to the Future. I have never seen him so excited. This truly is very creative. Characters are just like in the movie and I love the Delorean put together. I love the way lego can re create a movie in bricks. Definately recommend  this set.
B000LXQVA4|4.0|Took a star off only because we didn't find an English manual only Spanish, it took my husband a little longer to assemble.<br /><br />Our LO really love the jumperoo, it's the colors!, the sounds! the toys on it! and it can also bounce!  He loved it!  He's basically on it everyday but we limit his time to 5-10 minutes a day that's all.  We also put a sheep pillow/mat for his little feet.  But the jumperoo actually broke after 2 months use.  Our LO is only around 50-75 percentile.  he was really sad the day one of the spring broke.<br /><br />Amazon should will give customer a better pricing plan.  If a customer purchase something a day or two before an item's price drop they should give them a price adjustment.  They haven't even ship out the package yet and they wouldn't adjust it.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|As a prior military man I was so interested in the how, the organization<br />of the team, and what it took to be a member of this elite team.<br />The book did that for me.  I appreciated the last pages which give<br />detail to the layout of the compound, and the why of assignments to<br />each team member.  There are those who believe that an act of disloyalty<br />has taken place in which team identification and operations are disclosdedl.<br />I do not agree with that feeling at all; I believe it enhances and gives credit<br />to how strong, emotionally, psychologically, and physically, these great men are.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I loved the characters and their quirkiness. Every minute matters to each of us. We are not our diseases, but  rather how we relate to others.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Makes you want to keep trying just like you would on the machines at the fair or something,it's a great time passer
B000FC1KBG|4.0|I really enjoyed the message behind this book, treating your baby with respect and empathy.  I really appreciated the approach to forming a schedule for your baby and even as a mother  of four I found some use in he  approach to understanding and communicating with your baby.  The only thing that didn't really work for me was her approach to sleep training.  I don't mind the pick up/put down method in theory but putting it into practice was very physically demanding.  My 6 month old weighs in at around 19lbs and I found out quickly that I didn't have the back strength to lift him, put him down, lift him again etc. more than a hundred times in two hours.  We weren't getting anywhere with it so I decided to modify her approach and Ferber's approach to find a solution that would work for us.  I'm not saying that Tracy Hogg's method won't work just that it didn't work for us.  I encourage everyone to pay attention to the cues from their babies to find an approach that will work for them.
B009P1WES6|1.0|I'm an avid reader and this is the first time in my life that I have felt bound to write a review of a book. It's truly horrendous.<br />I bought this book on the basis that most of the reviews were positive and also because of the awards it had won. I got about 15% of the way through the book and felt that I just couldn't go on anymore. I deleted it from my Kindle. I really saw no similarity between it and a Stieg Larsson novel. Well, maybe the genre.<br /><br />As a woman, the plot and what happens to Alex at the beginning is too awful to contemplate - I felt distressed and had to stop reading.<br /><br />I also found the characters implausible and just couldn't take to any of them. Maybe it does get better further on but it wasn't a chance I was prepared to give it.
B0033AGJ5Y|1.0|The seller should have let it be known that this is not an american made dvd, although the film is american.  it is suited to play on european devices, and although i can modify my computer...it is a bit of a hassle.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved it. I was very disappointed when I tried to purchase the third book in the trilogy only to discover that it hasn't been published yet!  I can't wait.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|This game is a little confusing in thsat it tells you to go to one level and solve it and yet you can go back to the same level over and over and still do the same thing,  very weird if you ask me.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I watched this movie to learn about early socialization techniques in some different cultures.  Perfect for what I was looking for.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. You have to really use your head and read everything carefully.<br /> It is a lot of fun. My daughter loves playing it too.
B00E6895M6|5.0|Great Debut Album. I've been anticipating this release for a while now and it did not disappoint. Only 5 star I've given anything.
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|Big budget, big special effects, BIG lens flares. Too much action with too many one-dimensional characters with little to no character development. In short, I could have cared less about the \\"bonds\\" of friends and family between the good guys. In fact, the only people I felt for in this film where the bad guys. Solid performances from Simon Pegg and Zack Quinto.<br /><br />This is a rip-off of Star Trek II, TWOK. A really bad one. Who \\"okayed\\" this story? The screenwriter team should be ashamed for their \\"creative\\" plagiarizing of ideas and concepts from real writers who had originality, and the studio should be ashamed to have allowed this travesty to be created. Glad I didn't pay for it in the theater.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This may really be a five-star review, but I'm still reading it. So far, so good. Interesting characters, good descriptions of scenes so you can imagine the scene in your mind. Also enjoyed the author's intro... enlightening.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So glad read all three it was a great ending I'm glad there was a epilogue to show what happens after

B00F4KCD24|5.0|Just bought the deluxe version this morning and am loving it so far.  I am a huge Sting fan and was excited for something in this type of genre.  So far I am enjoying the subject matter as well as the excellent song writing and arrangements.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a book that is filled with defective people. Just like all of us. From the first chapter the tale is gripping and poignant.
B00ALGW286|5.0|This story takes place in the early 1990's during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It is written through the view point of a young girl named Marina, who lives in Russia and who has big dreams for her future. Now that communism is coming to an end and her country begins to experience democracy and freedom, she believes these dreams may be even more attainable. The changes also present new challenges for herself and for everyone around her.<br /><br />I was a young child during the early 1990's when all of this happened, so even though I have vague memories of hearing about it, most of what I know is from what I learned in school. It was fascinating to read about it here as seen through the eyes of an ordinary, young girl. I gained a much better sense of what it was like for Russians during that time.<br /><br />Like Marina, I have always had dreams of traveling and being able to see more of the world. Very few people in the Soviet Union were allowed to travel outside the country, however. As an American, I have never had such a restriction; although due to limited funds, I haven't done nearly as much traveling as I would like! It was very easy to relate to Marina even though we are from completely different parts of the world. She seemed very real, and reading about her life in Moscow was quite an enlightening experience.<br /><br />This well-written drama shows how uncertain our futures can be and how life is always changing -- whether for better or for worse. Highly recommended.
1468179993|5.0|This book is much like World Championship of Public Speaking, except you really need to pinpoint your message and drive your convictions home to get audience buy-in. Think any speaker would want to give a TED talk.

B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is fun, fast, and easy to use.  I like the way it starts out easy and becomes more challenging as you progress through the levels.  Well done!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Spoiler: this film isn't really about a plane crash, but a pilots issues with addiction.  The movie has the classic structure of a substance abuse drama ( and is occasionally heavy handed with religious references) but strong directorial work (particularly during the plane crash in the opening act ) and a compelling acting ensemble make the film highly watchable. Washington is terrific, taking his character, and the audience, to some truly uncomfortable places.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|First I got tricked to going to the movies to see this. Then my niece said that I needed to watch with her, nothing changed movie was not good to me.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|When you have seen as many movies as I have you tend to become jaded. You wonder if an original blockbuster-type movie will ever be made with genuine effort and a non-ironic purpose, especially in the sci-fi genre. You fear the day will never come. It is nice to be proven wrong.<br /><br />Oblivion is not a fantastic movie by any means. It has its problems. There are some inconsistencies and goofs here and there, but you can tell from the first few minutes that genuine thought and effort was put in to this movie, and that more than makes up for its other issues. There is a style and an atmosphere to it. In a time when green-screen rooms are substituted for real sets so often that you begin to worry for the livelihoods of studio carpenters, here is a film which \\"feels\\" real. These are sets and locations that, though parts of them were C.G., there was a seamless blending with the real that is a treat for computer weary eyes.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a technician responsible for the maintenance and security of huge reactors that supply power to off-world colonists. Earth has been nearly destroyed by an invading alien force and, though humanity won the war, the planet is a wasteland. This is explained by a helpful (if annoying) voice over/scroll at the beginning of the film. Jack's only company is his communications officer Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) with whom he occasionally gets frisky. Their memories are periodically erased to protect vital off-world information in case of capture by the remnants of the alien force which they call \\"Scavs\\". In spite of their memory wipes Jack has flashes of his life from before the war, which worries him because the war ended sixty years ago, well before he was born.<br /><br />His companion tells him to focus on his work and not to worry. After all, they are leaving for the new colony in two weeks and they don't want to ruin their chance to rejoin humanity. The work continues as usual until an encounter with the Scavs and the discovery of a crashed spaceship shake everything Jack thinks he knows.<br /><br />From here we would enter into spoiler territory, so I will dispense with the exposition. Suffice it to say that what follows, while not perfect, at least shows true effort at the writing, acting, directing, and effects levels. The actors really care about what they are doing and it shows. Tom Cruise, of course, can only play Tom Cruise. His range is limited, but here it is well used. The mystery of the plot, while a little predictable, at least doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. In a limited fashion the movie brings up questions about what it means to be human and what our purpose really is in the world. Though these issues are not delved into too deeply, it was nice to see them actually dealt with and not just used as cheap set pieces. The set designers and the director take care to create a world we can dive into and almost touch and taste. The sterility of Jack's base really contrasts with the grittiness of the devastated world below.<br /><br />The only items I would change are relatively minor. One is the opening scroll/narration. Opening scrolls may have been cool in Star Wars a few decades ago, but now they are a little dated and annoying. They are especially grating when read aloud to us and doubly so when you divulge the exact same information with dialogue not too long after. The other change would be to distinguish between the female leads physically a little better. Because of the washed out color scheme of the movie it is hard to tell the two women apart at times and it gets distracting. Is that her? No, wait. It's the other one. The fact that the two women are usually in different styles of clothing and in different locations helps, but it takes a while to get there.<br /><br />This is a movie well worth the effort put into it. It is good sci-fi with good execution and no franchise to prop it up. The studio went out on a limb by not playing it safe andfinding something to reboot or a big name to tag a sequel onto. Here's hoping this movie gets a lot of attention and maybe we will see more of its kind in the future.
B003W5C0VC|5.0|I have both versions, the first one called Manhunter with William Peterson and this one Red Dragon. Both movies were very good and suspenseful. Red Dragon is a better movie, but I would recommend watching both version.  Frankie Faison is in both movies the only actor to be in both versions.  Brian Cox compared to Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal, both are creepy and dangerous. Hopkins has played the role three times and Cox only once.  Just see both versions.
B005723JSQ|4.0|If you're looking for a good vacation novel, you won't be disappointed.  It's a treat for anyone looking to get their mind off work.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Very fun and upbeat movie.  The acting was superb!  I'd heard that it was a good movie and I was not disappointed.  It was hard not to cry at the end, but it was a happy ending.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I was very excited for season 4 it was great and I am ready for more. I think things are about to get interesting.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|One of the best updated Sherlock and Holmes, always holds your interest!  Very exciting and interesting! Would highly recommend.  Always look forward to the next one.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Haven't spent much time with this yet, but out of the box it didn't work.  And then sent me off to an equally simplistic website with the same instructions.  I guess I'll have to really sort through this.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed season three.  Looking very forward to the upcoming season four.  Hope this goes on for many more seasons.

0525951652|5.0|As usual Follett entertains while informing. His attention to historical detail is impressive. His research for writing this novel was very thorough. I look forward to reading the next one.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Much to my dismay, this book was centered entirely around Muggles.<br />For the first three chapters I thought the characters might be squibs. Or that the Hogwarts owls would arrive soon. But alas, the characters wander about oblivious to the presence of witches and wizards in their midst. One star.
B006CEYM3Y|5.0|Trajan is a great board game with some very unique elements.  One the one hand, it looks and plays like any other European worker placement game.  On the other hand, the action selection mechanic is truly unique and adds a lot of interesting strategic options.  Rather than simply choosing an action based on availability/cost/etc., players move wooden tokens around a circular track with &#34;pits&#34; in it, a la mancala.  The action pit you end up in is the one you take.  Furthering this mechanic is the fact that the wooden tokens are colored and the color combination that you end up with can get you bonus actions and points if you have a matching Trajan tile placed above the action you choose.  It sounds quite complicated, and on some level, it is, but it isn't too hard to learn the game overall.<br />Due to its unique mechanics and deep strategy, I've had a great time playing Trajan so far, and will no doubt continue to enjoy it for years to come!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Works well and is quick on note 8. No problems and entertaining.  For a free app this is worth picking up
1468179993|5.0|I loved this book! I feel totally prepared to give a TED talk...in fact, for me, this book &#34;broke down&#34; all the steps necessary for a successful TED talk, brought a huge picture down into digestible parts AND inspired me to apply to give a talk myself. An easy and delightful read full of helpful and usable material.
B00ECU4DPW|5.0|We bought this for our granddaughters, and they just love this movie, except for a small creepy part. The great thing about Amazon Instant Movie it that we can watch it from any device. We just love being Amazon Prime Members.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|Ghost is a beautiful love story tragedy about a young couple whose potential long life together was cut short by greed and murder.  One of the characters, Swayze, finds an opportunity to revenge his killing through utilizing the resources of a Medium Fraud, Goldberg, who turns out to be more genuine than she originally thought. Whoopi Goldberg brings such a delightful blend of humor and shock to the story, but she has a tendency to go over the top in a couple scenes.  Swayze is flawless in his role. Demi Moore, as believable as she may be in the romance, does have one scene that always bothers me: when Swayze's partner pushes for her to go for a walk and heal, she slaps him in anger.  Only the slap scene is hollow and without substance.<br /><br />Swayze's partner (can't remember his name and too lazy to look it up) does a fantastic job of playing his role, as well.  I could actually smell his sweat when he lost the cash in the account.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Awesome book!  Great characters!  Great story line!  Loved every minute of it!  Would highly recommend!  Read it...seriously.  You will not be disappointed.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This was well written, however I was disappointed it didn't really pick up from the previous story I had just finished. It dif not take as long to read this one either because it was much easier to get into and follow. Just ended too quickly. Can't wait for the next one!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game. I'm having so much fun and to think it's free. I hope they do more updates.
B007BVMVDU|4.0|just awesome.  The realistic placement of what things in the past occurred.  Although it is fiction, I am glued to the Game of Thrones when I can watch it.

0380018179|3.0|But I remembered it to be far better than it really was.  Okay, so I was a teen when I saw the movie and read the book. I'm old and I forgot it. Now?  Meh.  It's not horrible; it's just not great.  My mother and I discussed it after she finished it, and we agreed the biggest problem with the story was that we didn't really like any of the characters.  Patrick was okay but favored the boys. Mama was selfish and miserable because she didn't get to marry the man she really loved, so she made everybody else pay.  Auntie is just all about money. Meggie's oldest brother has anger management issues. Meggie's husband was a jerk. Ralph cheated on God. Meggie's kids weren't special, either.  Her daughter was a crude actress who happened to stumble on a nice guy, but instead of landing him, she toyed with him. These characters might be fiction, but our theory is that Ms McCullough believed she evolved these characters to be admirable. We didn't agree. The only one who was true to herself was Auntie Evil. She knew she was rotten to the core and reveled in it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Awesome book!  Great characters!  Great story line!  Loved every minute of it!  Would highly recommend!  Read it...seriously.  You will not be disappointed.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I loved this book because of all the tear jerking moments. If you've followed the chief throughout all of the story, you finally see some humanity from the Spartans after so long they aren't just robots in a suit anymore.
B000EQHHJW|5.0|The music is beautiful, Luciano Pavarotti and Ingvar Wixell are excellent in this opera.  I'm unfortunately belated in my exposure to opera but recommend this without reservation.  There are subtitles in many languages or your choice of no subtitles and a little booklet included which explains the story.  Really enjoyed this and undoubtedly will watch many more times!
B008M87GJK|4.0|Sometimes you get more news from the BBC than you get from CNN, CBS or FOX.  Go figure.  Certainly better coverage of Southwest Asia and Africa.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Don't listen to the other reviews. This series is meant for young adults and everyone who wrote those reviews must be in their 50's. Love this series.  So much better than the movie. Worth the read. Worth having in paperback and on the kindle.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I bought it for my daughter, who is a pianist and a teen. She has been a fan of Evanescence since a friend introduced her to that style.  It's not me, but I have to admit this woman's talent is astonishing! It's not just her powerful vocals and arrangements of the music. Her selection of music and lyrics grips the soul.  My personal iPhone has several of her softer, slower songs on it, and they are located in my favorites.<br /><br />The best part about Evanescence is the piano sheet music that I bought because of the songs.  My daughter plays piano voluntarily for hours every day!
B00F91SCXC|4.0|INTENSE. Best zombie movie I have ever seen.. Zombies are fast and scary. I saw this at the theatre and couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I have decided to reread all of the books again and this is great reading. Salvatore is a great literary man
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I'm not usually on to throw the word 'perfect' at anything, but in this case I feel that I need to.<br /><br />The quality of all the movies in this set is debatable; I love them all, some just more so than others.<br /><br />Now outside of the movies themselves, this set has some of the BEST remastering I have ever seen on any format. With the first three movies the video quality is gorgeous and crystal clear; I've even been told that this set has been used to test out the black levels for newer TV's and I believe it!<br />The fourth movie doesn't fair as well in the visual department, but that has more to do with how the movie was filmed than the quality of this set (supposedly vasolene or something similar was smeared onto the camera lens before filming to give it a distinct 'slimy' look). In spite of that this is the best transfer this movie has had so far.<br /><br />Audio quality is equally impressive for all the movies. I just love cranking up the surround sound while watching these. ^_^<br /><br />Special features are where the set really shines as it has hours upon hours of great and really interesting bonus features, behind the scenes documentaries and cast interviews. There's even a cool little interactive element to they way you can watch these that mimic's Mother from the first Alien movie.<br /><br />I'd say this set is easily worth the $30 or so that most retailers are  asking for it and it is easily one of my most prized movie collections.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Get this, it cleans your device super fast and keeps it running great. This rules. I can't believe this was free. I'd give it six stars if I could.
B00000G3I2|5.0|Excellent acting and a nice stroll down memory lane.  The music is appropriately chosen and the story is easy to relate to especially for those of us who experienced the late sixties.
B000HL2J0G|3.0|It was fun to watch the original MacGyver series. I watched it in the 80's and loved it. But 30 years later, much of what I thought of as new and edgy is now feeling a bit tired. The dialog is sophomoric and the characters are one dimensional compared to the complex characters you find on average programs today.<br /><br />All that said, if you watched this show back in the day, you'll get a bit nostalgic looking back at what we used to watch.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Its perfect for the family.. Not only kids will like it but also adults too. Funny movie and a very little drama :-)
B00004IC9G|5.0|As far as debut albums go,this one is awesome. Eric Adams has one of the best voices in metal of all time
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait for season four to start.  The characters seem so real to me that when someone dies I cry.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|It is a great movie! I usually not a big fan of zombie movies, but I really enjoyed watching this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed relaxing while playing this game- I was very bummed when I got to level 10 and didn't even notice until it was over. Now I'm reviewing so maybe they will give me level 11! Please release more!!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I would have gave it five stars but I cant merge with facebook.  When I try it makes me start all over with a new park.  Im a level 18 so not starting over
B009GIPDQS|5.0|The end of this book will surprise you, or at least it did me.  Like other Grisham books, this one was a great read that flowed from start to finish.  I loved learning the inside story of judges.
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|Well gosh folks, after waiting twelve years for a new record from Cher I feel like I should have more to say about it now that one is actually here. Closer to the Truth is by no means a bad album, make no mistake about it. In fact I'm actually really enjoying it and predict it won't leave my player for a while. But at the same time, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't exactly the kind of dance/pop album I expected it to be, with no additional frills or surprises. The thing is, Believe and Living Proof, brilliant and groundbreaking as they were in their day, followed very specific formulas which, fast forward to 2013, Cher has strayed very little from. Again, that isn't necessarily a criticism, but don't go into it expecting some grand reinvention or that she has spent all this time secretly plotting the next big trend. If you have kept up with Cher at all since about 1998, this should be familiar territory to you.<br /><br />So with that said, I'm still very pleased with what she has delivered here. The bulk of the album is comprised of catchy, upbeat tracks that are definitely club-oriented, yet also successfully fuses elements of different genres together to forge identities of their own. Some moments even hark back to the more adult contemporary, \\"rocker chick\\" Cher of the 80's, which I know many fans were eager to see resurface again. Ironically, it's the first single, Woman's World, that is probably the least representative of the record as a whole. Yes, it's fun in the moment, but probably not one you'll be caught singing to yourself later. My Love finds Cher channeling Donna Summer in a surreal 70's inspired anthem, and she goes just a little bit country for Favorite Scars, a song that wouldn't be entirely out of place on the Heart of Stone album. Every Cher album is entitled to one true power ballad, and I Hope You Find It takes up that role here. Sirens is a little more low-key, but I love the imagery invoked by the lyrics. If I had to choose, I'd say Dressed to Kill is actually my favorite song on the disc. Despite what others will tell you, she actually reins in the vocoder and techno effects quite a bit on this record compared to prior releases, but they're back in full force on this song that for some reason I can only describe as \\"very European.\\" Truth be told there really aren't any songs here that I would go as far as to call bad, though a couple such as Red and Take it Like a Man didn't really stand out or leave much of an impression on me one way or the other. As far as the exclusive bonus tracks from the red bullseye retailer, the only one I'm super impressed with is the poignant Will You Wait For Me, mostly because I find the lyrics personally relatable.<br /><br />Anyhow, these are just my early thoughts, but I think it's safe to say any existing Cher fan should be satisfied overall and have some fun with this, though I can't honestly say I'm able to picture any of these tracks exploding up the mainstream charts or becoming timeless classics in the vein of Turn Back Time or Believe. Otherwise, she's at the top of her form and can still belt it out like no other. If anything her voice has only gotten deeper since the last time we heard from her, if you can imagine that, lol. Ultimately, those who are touting it as \\"worth the wait\\" or \\"her best CD yet\\" may be a little overzealous and are probably just excited to have something new at all, but it's a solid pop record nevertheless and worth getting a hold of if you have the chance.to Kill is actually my favorite song on the disc.

B004QZ9PLU|3.0|This was the first book I purchased for my Kindle.  I read The Notebook and should have known that this book would be sad.  It was and I was sad after finishing the book.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Very nice looking app. Runs well on my kindle. Might not be so great for those that have never taken a language class. More context based learning. I wish that there was a &quot;slower&quot; button for other words to get the pronounciation a bit better.
B0089LOG02|4.0|4 stars. Very good book, but I felt like the ending was rushed.  I would be interested in reading more books about the orphan train children, biography & memoirs.
0307120007|5.0|This book is one of the funnest ones to read to children because they love to pat the bunny. The children love to pat the bunny.
1594484805|5.0|I am a Licensed Counseling Psychologist that has made his living teaching research-related courses for the last thirty years at several different universities.  I was aware of most of the psychological studies Daniel Pink (a Washington D. C. Attorney) cited as evidence.  I found Daniel Pink's book DRIVE: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, to be a thoughtful, helpful, and encouraging read. Several psychologists would object that the word \\"drive\\" refers to (and should only refer to) physiological needs that \\"push\\" us, as opposed to \\"aspirations\\" or \\"goals\\" that \\"pull\\" us.  But, we can experience any and/or all of them as strong motivational forces within us, so I'm not going to quibble too much about the definitions.<br /><br />Pink says that most corporations are still generally using their versions of the \\"carrot and the stick approach\\" - promising bonuses and otherwise rewarding workers when they get what they want (which can often feel like a \\"bribe\\" to the worker), and using threats, demotions, and firings when they don't get what they want.  These methods will not and cannot release the best things intelligent and creative human beings are capable of, writes Pink.<br /><br />Humans, writes Pink, are mostly motivated by A.M.P.  - Autonomy (enough independence to feel free to do their best work), Mastery (the drive to complete patterns, and achieve the best possible outcomes), and Purpose (to gain a deep sense of personal fulfillment and meaning from consistently doing great work).  Pink argues that corporations/work environments that recognize and build upon these higher human needs and motivations will reap the greater rewards.  His Encarta vs. Wikipedia illustration is powerful and persuasive.<br /><br />I recommended this book to the Chair of our Business Program.  He now has made DRIVE required reading in his Management courses.<br /><br />A close friend of mine is  a \\"turn around specialist\\" for a major restaurant chain.  He tells me that most ofthe hourly staff are really not ready for a full-blown A.M.P. approach, and still need a lot of direction, and sometimes the \\"carrot and stick approach\\" to keep them moving in the right direction.  But, he acknowledges, that the chain's managers would probably respond much better to an A.M.P. approach, versus the \\"carrot and stick approach\\" they usually experience.<br /><br />Even if Pink's book is at times overly repetitious, and at other times a bit too simplistic and over-generalized, I still give it 5 Stars for boldly and creatively reminding us of some of the best (and strongest!) motivations within us, and what we and others can actually achieve, if only given the opportunity.<br /><br />I believe one of my early mentors, psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, would have approved of and appreciated the message of DRIVE.  You can read more about Viktor Frankl in my Kindle book:  [[ASIN:B009JXHJ7Q From Sigmund Freud to Viktor Frankl: How Psychiatry Became Human]].  From any source, it's always good to be reminded that we are not rats or mules, and we and others should not routinely be treated as such.
1439190275|5.0|I have read and reread and I find something different each time. Great for having the carb list handy to highlight my favorites.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Good game nice gunz need more fire power but I'm just never happy but it makes me wanna shoot more..
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|The director tried to maintain a high level of intensity, but the result is a flat movie.  The casting problems were evident and the participation of Bruce Willis feels like a cliché.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Because it has lots of obstacles and carts, you can get different people and can upgrade stuff. It is good quality and works well. It has lots of different coloured coins.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|This CD is wonderful.  The music is so up beat and creative.  Katy Perry is a real talent.  Fun to listen to in the car.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Throughout the first half of the book the storyline is very predictable.  The ending may surprise some, but if you pay close attention, the author is leading us to this inevitable conclusion.  The book is an enjoyable, quick read.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|You could be able to not pay for the levels and just unlock them but things don't always happen<br />But for the most part the game is extraordinary,one of a kind.
142314189X|5.0|I have these on my Kindle but I had to get them in hardback. I bought these books on hardback through Amazon and got them a day earlier than I thought I would, go Amazon, nice job. Happy customer!<br /><br />Here you follow a young demi god son of Poseidon on his adventures with his friends. Although there now movies, I'll tell you to read the books they're 100% better than the movies. It's set based for younger adults but I found myself rereading these series and I'm 30, there full of action, fun mythology and plenty of humor in it for anyone to enjoy these books. My favorite one's out of the series is the Lightening Thief and The Last Olympian.
1878424319|5.0|This was a good read and the book was brand new, in beautiful condition.  The book arrived promptly and I was pleased with the purchase.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I heard this CD while traveling with a friend.  The songs are great.  Kelly Clarkson is such a talented singer.
1603427244|5.0|I never knew there could be so many ways to cast on or bind off. I bought it so I could learn how to do a stretchier bind off for the cowl I'm making. Looks like this will fit the bill.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because,after having a long day of work an school. It's nice to have something fun to do. It's entertaining an keeps me occupied :-) :-) :-)
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|Horrible movie ti watch. Just a waste of time. The original was still better. Not that it was that much better though!
B008L40Q7E|2.0|I decided to get Dr.No on Kindle after reading Thunderball. I was enjoying the book again until half way, when I started seeing the following: #$2013 in the middle of a sentence. This went on the rest of the book, and greatly reduced my enjoyment as sentences were interrupted with this glitch. I purchased another Bond book and hope it does not have similar mistakes in it. The book is still an entertaining read, but the mistakes in print make for annoying distractions.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Before you begin reading this gem, get very comfortable and relax. You are in for a wild ride of emotions, frustrations and horrors of the reality of  times not so very long ago. Bravo, John Grisham!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Never have I read a story so complete and rewarding. It gave me a deep appreciation for family - the good and the bad, and the gifts we get from them. Thank you for allowing me to see my life through gentler eyes. This book deserves only the highest praise.
0757302661|5.0|I found this to be very informative and an awesome tool for anyone who will be giving birth. it takes the fear out of child birth.
0805086846|4.0|This book tells the story and broken treaties and mistreatment of our Native American brothers from their unique perspective. It is the \\"other side\\" of an important story that needed to be told.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|I bought the series to share with my family at Christmas.  We will watch together<br />in front of a roaring fire.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Is fun, even addictive. But, once you surpass the lower levels in the game, you sometimes need extra &quot;help,&quot; which there are multiple choices - but at a price. This is a game that I refuse to purchase &quot;extras.&quot; Prior to the latest upgrade, friends from Facebook could send you lives to continue with game play &amp; it helped keep the momentum going. I have yet to receive anything but coins since. For anyone interested in spending their money, play on.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I just updated and now all of my groups are gone from the sidebar. Another terrible update. Now I need to figure out how to uninstall.
B00D0QSZHG|5.0|The principles in here are amazing. I like that it's given from a biblical standpoint as well! 5stars from me! Ready to apply, & change my life!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|for a free app this is great fun for even younger users. we are having fun playing and thinking for families.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I'll admit, after reading The Shining when I was around 10, I periodically wondered what Danny would be like as an adult. How would the events from the book would influence his life; how would his father's actions color his own adult relationships?<br />This is a great sequel. Moody, magical and mysterious. It's everything I wanted.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Probably one of the best movies of 2012. Anna Kendrick and rebel Wilson are great in this movie. This is my go to movie when I'm just bored or sad and need a good laugh!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Brad Pitt is great in this movie, it was a great movie!we all liked it,wow what a long review,yes 5 stars
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Wow and wow. Don't want to wait twenty years again for a book series to draw to its conclusion.  I think a lot of us had lost all hope of seeing the end, but Brandon Sanderson did justice and more to finishing the story that Robert Jordan began all those years ago. A spectacular end, or was it one end or perhaps another beginning?
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|Never played HALO or followed the any of the premise, but I was bored and thought I would give it a try, wow, very happy. This is very well done and not a cheesy SyFy movie, as a newbie, I had no issues on following the story. cool beans
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One was terrific reading experience.  It was as fresh and addictive as the early arcade games that make up part of the book's back story.  Ernest Cline's view of future is a believable extension of the part we've already lived. I forgot there was a writer and instead felt like a fellow gamer following the protagonist through harrowing video adventures, and even more dangerous real world threats.<br />I'm a writer in an entirely different genre, and only occasionally read sci-fi and fantasy. Ready Player One was a gift, and I have purchased a second copy to give away. This one is staying on my bookshelf next to Ender's Game, the Harry Potter series, and the Foundation series.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|The tripod is sort of a novelty item included, but the camera holder is fantastic because it holds the iphone to a connector for any tripod.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I love these guys they never have a problem.I have a go game from them and chess they're both excellent this backgammon game is no exception they put everything in here that you need to play the game perfectly the AI is superb and the game is always just as fun as playing the real-life version if you love these kinds of games download it.
B007RD4KQ8|3.0|Not bad not great. Some interesting unreleased stuff but nothing really grabs you. I was expecting much more since I thought Born Again was a great Sabbath album.
B00ANTX3HA|5.0|Very well done story, McNamara comes across as a very sharp and matter of fact person, but he seems to skip over many aspects of what impact his decisions had. He is a classic statistician, claims to only say he did the numbers, but not any responsibility for deaths of civilians. Should of been tried as a war criminal.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I usually speed read but that was impossible and it would have been a crime to rush through this amazing story.  The Book Thief is one of the best stories ever written.  The tenderness is raw and heartfelt with every character, but especially Leisel, the main character.  The ingeniousness is using death as the narrator.  I hear they're making a movie out of this novel.  read the book first.
B00821PCJS|4.0|A nice addition to post-apocalyptic drama. I will continue to watch this show. Interesting story, interesting characters. Worth your time.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I was disturbed by the story, husbands and wives shouldn't stray. Period. Communication I a vital part of any relationship, necessary to succeed.  The story was well written, but not my type of book.  Good for a light read while on a long train ride or trip.
1600242197|5.0|This book was adrenaline filled and action packed from the very start. Knowing it is a true story written by the SEAL himself was mind blowing. This is in my top five best books I've experienced and I have recommended it to several others.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|When I was a little-known boy I loved angry birds I got it today and I loved it on my iPod I played the pork side. It was great. Today on my iPod I got to the next palace
0395389496|5.0|My 6 years old son loves the story and so do we, the parents.  very meaningful.  I definitely recommand the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the most fun I have ever played! Who is ever out there that has not played this game, well the only thing I can say is that you HAVE to get this game... NOW!!!!!!
0521173787|3.0|good book, but I think is expensive when you have to buy separetly the CD to make the listening parts
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I choose this game on a whim, and I am pleased.  It challenges my mind and forces me to think about solving the problems in non traditional ways.  It is very difficult to stop  playing.  It is a daily joy.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is easily the best book I have ever read. I could relate with Hannah and I saw that I'm not alone. This is a must read.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I have had Chromecast for about a week and for the most part it was working great. Suddenly today I can't cast any google products on GOOGLE's own Chromecast.  I can cast Youtube and Netflix, but I can't cast the TV shows I purchased from google using their own Chromecast device.  I will be returning the two I bought and saying good buy to purchasing google products in the future.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Couldn't put I down after finding the letter. So many people whose lives touched each other in positive & negative ways. Reminded me of living in small towns where everyone knows each other.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|We have watched all 4 seasons of The Good Wife on Amazon Prime, and we ar now ready to continue as new episodes are broadcast during the current season. We really enjoy being able to play &#34;catch-up&#34; on worthwhile programming, because most of the recent &#34;entertainment&#34; is really just &#34;junk!&#34;
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Of course it was great! All the discs were in perfect condition, the case was well protected. Still have it to this day!
B00DYVUBYM|5.0|first, i saw the trailer for this when i  went to the mtv Movie awards. i was BORED! but, when i saw  i saw it on IMBD, i was HOOKED. i am a fan of emma watson, as well as taissa farmiga, so i thought it would be great. i got it on redbox,  and i was excited all the way through. the acting and picture quality is OUTSTANDING!  get this movie, or if you just want to see it once to see if it is any good, get it at redbox or paperview. eleven thubs UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't put it down. I love reading stories of strong caring woman and finding the right someone to help the her to see she isn't alone.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great upgrade for hard to find OEM battery function.  Take the plunge.  It has worked perfectly for me!  I rely on it everyday!
B0081336FO|4.0|One of the better Sherlock Holmes presentations.  It had a very real feeling to it and characters you are more likely to encounter in real life.
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|Excellent book.  Well written and truly entertaining.  Moved on to Book of Joe immediately and am about to start Plan B.
B0017TWUZG|1.0|I do not like this product at all along with 4 other DVDs due to the region code this is not specerfied on your website nor was I told when I went to make the purchase
B0093X805W|5.0|I read this to my grandson over several days.  We both saw the movie.  Reading the book was as much fun as watching the movie and more interactive (with my grandson).
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|cool game and with lot of fun. great graphics. cool stuff and items. dragons well draw. great story and tutorials
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  I played it in adventure mode, on a kindle fire.  . No problems, good story line, nice graphics and fun mini games.  It was short for the price charged.  There's no hidden object pages which I like, for as change of pace.  I would say it's a strong four rating but I did not enjoy the constant requests to give a five star rating.  I almost took a star off for that, but didn't.  I feel that when I pay for a game, leave me alone. I always review after I've played the game so I know what I'm talking about when I leave a review.  For the price I expected a bonus chapter but there wasn't any one.  The dev said if u leave a (5) star rating you will get a sequel.  I've been promised that before but have never gotten one, so we'll see what happens.
0061950726|5.0|Really good book.  I liked the historical facts, of which I had not been familiar.  Also the novel and the concept of the two different time frames was very interesting and made for a good read.
B00A3VLJCE|2.0|I thought the idea behind it was pretty cool. Being a photoshopper since version 2.5 I thought this would be a format to look forward to. After dealing with this app I got frustrated of the lag time and the delays. Lets Keep Photoshop where it belongs... On the desktop! Just remember people. PS will and always be a memory hogger!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Good tie together and decent action. Not all of the movies were my favs but they were entertaining. Would have to give most of the credit to Robert Downey although Scarlet J was great.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great Plot - couldn't put it down.  Very great read  Worth the money you will spend on this one !!
1587143879|5.0|I like it.......thank  you Amazone and sir. Wendell I learn and I try to get my CCENT, Amazing and great
B0063GORYU|4.0|The ads that take over after every game are annoying,  but this seems to be the new standard ad format. I prefer the ones that run while I'm playing. Other than that, It's the standard game and plays easily and has some cool options.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I replaced my MVR V 600 head phones which had served me well for years! These I'm delighted to say are better and cup the ears to keep out much ambient noise.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I  Love it it was a some had so much fun playing g there is so much to do the grooming is fun I love the like racing I have two horses now
B001HM1PFO|5.0|I wasn't quite sure about how I'd feel about it at first, but after watching it a hundred times it's become more and more intriguing. I'd recommend this to anyone who questions watching it.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Aside from the fact that your fingers are practically under the blade while you're honing each and every one you come across, this little gadget is definitely one to have around. I've used it in the field and in the kitchen, coming across only a few blades that have resisted its charms.<br /><br />The ceramic rod is a little difficult to unfold, but will stay locked into place once open.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book so much that in the middle of class I bursted out laughing then everyone started laughing with me I really loved this book.
B008JFUO72|5.0|This movie is fantastic! I love it! It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The actions is awesome, the acting is nearly flawless and the story line is the best of all the Iron Man movies I've seen so far! Any fan of Iron Man comics and movies, should definitely buy it! :)
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I am a total Walking Dead geek. Love, love, love the story line and fabulous cast. I would recommend this series to any serious Sci Fi or horror lover.
0062080237|1.0|I do not like to start a book and not finish it. I really wrestled with that decision, but I found it to be an abominable trudge. Should I critique a book I barely got into? So, I read alot of reviews of this book and then read reviews of other books to get a read on opinion that might be like mine. I'm glad I did. I totally put this book down but will read at least one of the author's other books.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|The actor and actress are good over all, I like the movie very much. good job. it's unique not a copy cat.
B00DYVUBYM|3.0|This movie wasn't as good as I'd expected to be. However, it was okay, it had some funny moments and as far as I can tell is pretty accurate to the actual events that took place. The actors did pretty well for roles that didn't have much substance to them, so I have to give them some credit for that. The movie is worth owning simply because Emma Watson is in it, in my opinion. I'm her fan to the end, I'll buy anything with her in it.
B000EXZI14|5.0|As you can tell, I am a great fan of the Bee Gees.  It makes me so sad to know that all but one of them is still with us.  Their concert in Las Vegas was made of gold.<br /><br />Las Vegas Baby
0375842209|5.0|I liked pretty much everything about this book despite it's unusual presentation. The story is great. Character development is really great. Death narrating really works well. Touching and Heartfelt. I recommend it.<br />I don't understand why it is marketed to youth. I would not recommend it to children.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Interesting story, action packed would purchase more books by Lee Child. Jack Reacher is at his best and manages once again to  save the day.
B005CRQ2XA|3.0|Pretty short...unexpectedly De-ja-voo....yea,it's fine.    P.S:I love the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series of books and movies.  Jeff Kinney,your one of my all-time heros.      P.S:I HAVE HARD LUCK +I finished the series-thrice!  You know what i mean.    (a kid's review)

044654759X|5.0|This book was in great condition at a great price!! i really loved it. i do recommend it to everybody!!
B004OC07GM|5.0|It's been a very long time since I've last read anything that has stimulated my own thinking as much as this book has.<br /><br />I've also learned about concepts that were new to me, such as the Resources-Processes-Values framework and the product lifecycle going from Functionality, over Reliability, Convenience, and finally to Price.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|I have never been a fan of Avenged Sevenfold. I heard the song \\"Hail to the King\\" on the radio one day and was blown away. Could not believe that it Was A7X. Bought the CD and was pleasantly surprised with the whole thing. The album has an \\"Old School\\" Metal feel to it and takes me back to when Metal was in its glory days in the early/mid 90's. Very very nice album. I hope to hear more like this from A7X.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best series on TV, may have to watch again.  Ready for season 4.  Hooray to PBS for a great show.
B00153ZC8Q|3.0|I've seen the movie, just wanted my son to see it. I am not sure what the problem was, but after the first 10 or so minutes, playback kept stopping. We never got past the first quarter of the movie.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Best movie ever period.........................................Morgan freeman was fantastic....the whole story was believable<br />everyone got what he was supposed to get save the little fat guy at the start of the film
B00CQRN3QI|5.0|Now and forever a Disney classic! A timeless story with superb animation. They don't make them like this anymore. Disney like MTV will never be as good as it once was...
B0063M22QO|5.0|My only problem is once I start playing, I can't put it down.  Good game and good for the brain.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen a long time!!!!  Everyone should see it!!! It has so many great messages.
B00F5F0208|5.0|Just wanted to put an early warning out there... I purchased this through android app Amazon mp3 as I do most of my music. Play store didn't have the deluxe version. I did not and still don't see anything stating this is the censored version. With no way to return this I will end up buying the uncensored version elsewhere. I hope this prevents someone else from making the same mistake. Obviously his will not affect my review of the album itself which I will add to as I listen more.
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|Brilliant Music filled with terrible irrelevant lyrics.<br />I understood what he was trying to do, but if he spent more time writing better verses, his voice wouldn't be testing my patience.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|The Fourth Season has been amazing. The cast is stellar and clicks on all levels. My daughter watches this program. She also loves it. If only more network TV came up to NCIS's standards. Keep up the good work NCIS, and we will keep watching.
B00122MWU6|5.0|I fell in love with 'in the morning of the magicians'  the first time I heard if. You will to.
B008Y768XO|1.0|I own dogs. I know the laws about domesticated animals, and if this story is true or based in true events, I can see that the cruelty of the characters involved has been diverted into a circus of sympathy full of hypocrisy.<br /><br />This is a dog that appears to suffer of ADD, because was not capable to play catching a ball to be returned to the owner up to some years later. The only \\"trick\\" this dog was capable to learn was to go forth and back the train station following or waiting for his owner.<br /><br />The story leans on the idea that people will trust the \\"will of the dog\\", this is to say, to do what the dog \\"thinks is best\\".<br /><br />We see a dog (Hachi) that comes from another country and by chance the cage falls and brakes and the dog \\"finds\\" a person who will take care of this animal. So far, nobody (and this is important to remember) nobody wants to adopt the animal, neither the worker at the train station, the hot dog tender, and so forth. Finally, Mr. Parker (the person who found the lost puppy) adopted the dog.<br /><br />This dog received lots of attention and love from Mr. Parker, and received treats from people who knew Mr Parker.<br /><br />One day, Mr Parker died and the dog was taken by his survivor, the daughter, to a new house. Apparently the dog didn't receive love and proper care anymore, and the dog escaped to make the only \\"trick\\" learned: to wait for Mr. Parker at the train station.<br /><br />The story continues with Mr. Parker's daughter leaving the dog free to go so the dog will never return back.<br /><br />This action by the daughter is the beginning of the cruelty that was performed by the rest of characters in this story. Everybody was in the move to feel \\"compassion\\" for the dog waiting every day for Mr. Parker at the train station. These people did nothing to adopt the animal or to find someone to take care of Hachi. This dog became a \\"street dog\\" because the owner decided to get rid off this animal. Ten years passed by andthis animal lived in the street suffering the changes of weather, living by the \\"treats\\" given by some people, and wasting life sitting or resting at the front of the train station waiting for Mr. Parker. Ten years, a street dog.<br /><br />I have no idea about laws for pets, but surely Mr. Parker's daughter should have to pay a penalty for releasing the dog to the street instead of taking the dog to an animal shelter.<br /><br />Hachi died \\"like a dog\\" in the street, old, dirty, alone, without love and care. Who pay to bury the dead dog? Perhaps the city? How in the world this city has built a monument to the dog, when the whole story is no more that animal cruelty after the death of Mr. Parker? I should investigate who were the owners of that dog and collect the charges for the burying of the dog, the cleaning of the dog's poo poo in the streets, and a huge penalty with years of interest for the illegal release the animal to the street.<br /><br />If this story is true, shame on you, the woman who released the dog to the street, shame of you, the train station worker, the hot dog seller, shame of you, the city which built the monument... shame of you, all the participants in this story who did nothing to take care of this poor animal, you make me sick with your imagination that the dog was something special and that was capable to rule its own destiny by some mysterious fate.<br /><br />A story that should be told, is the dog learning new tricks, playing with Mr. Parker's grandson, receiving attention and love in the new house. But what this story is about, is like to say that your father lost your mother, and instead of giving him love and care, you \\"release\\" your father to be a drunker, to wait for her at the bus stop for ten years, to forget shaving and taking showers, and to die miserably in the streets...<br /><br />Is this how \\"heroes\\" died?<br /><br />What a tale story or story tale... tell me about it...
B004T4KQJS|5.0|I choose this book because I wanted to know the answer to the question on the cover. I liked the book because it is in plain english. It made me want to advance my education where I can understand the math. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for answers.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like the different littlest tasks you are given. however, wish could play longer without having to buy energy. It's a free game, but can only play 3 or 4 rounds before needing energy. otherwise great game.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Totally awesome  game. My son loves the game. Great graphics and levels are just difficult enough. Highly recommend this game.
B008M4MB8K|3.0|when I got this, said it has 5 discs, only had 3.  Not the end of the world but not what I thought I had purchased.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Great movie, more than I expected.  The price for the movie was right up my alley.  It couldn't be better.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Sometimes this game can be frustrating because you are not given a lot of time and the objects are hard to find.  It is ok in the fact that you don't need to spend any money if you don't mind waiting to gain energy to be able to continue playing.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|Really enjoyed this book. Will read more of her books. 5 stars from me. Enjoy all the free books offered.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|Impressive sophmore release by the post MP era configuration. The songs are buff and you will want to listen to it turned way up. There are grand elements that snake together and march forth with vigor ! This is a powerhouse of a new kind for DT and is a common theme throughout.  Mangini is really really really good. Still prefer Portnoy though-  more dynamic  than Mike M. I really wanted Marco Minneman or Donati to win the job so they would find a new direction. I also really hoped DT would do the honorable thing and change their name.<br />Petrucci  has maintained his strong dynamic influences which always hold the albums together.  labrie  puts the DT stamp on everything but sounds a bit worn down and dare I say flakey in spots. Myung is more testicular on this cd perhaps because of the new chemistry between himself and mangini.<br />This cd is focused on grandiose technical construction that leaves you exhilirated but not as emotionally drained as earlier works.<br />I would buy it for sure but no matter how great DT may get post MP, they will never be quite the same! A bit too contrived and lacks the defining \\"progness\\" that they built their kingdom on.<br />I would note that I am finding more prog metal joy in my purchases of Pagans Mind and Symphony X than I did with this and the previous DT CD.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Like the game, but don't want to spend any more money. I am not so tech savvy, but I don't like the delays to play due to the lack of power. Also don't like that game says you can buy with coins when it can't. Can't seem to do that procedures. Very fun and diverse picture game!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Wow. Just wow. I'm not usually a fan of sci-fi, but this book was so engrossing. The psychological elements and the actual story are so entwined it's hard to know where one ends and the other begins. Emotional roller coaster :)
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This app never worked so I just erased it from my kindle. It is just as easy to check Facebook via its web browser anyway.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game to play when you are waiting. Like the scoring feature so you can compete against yourself for a better time or score.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Loved it on TV and love being able to watch it again before the start of Season 4!  Marathon fest anyone?
0385349947|5.0|Great book.  It is not only about Gender in the work environment.  Great career advice as well. Recommended read for all genders.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Sent the BluRay edition back for an refund as would not work in my laptop but kept the regular edition and love it.
B000R9RGF6|5.0|I love listening to Ludovico's soulful yet exhilarating pieces.<br />I am impressed with his extraordinary talent.<br />I often listen when I am in my studio contemplating my writing or the sky.<br />Thank you for creating such exquisite music.<br />Michal
B00D5CENXA|4.0|I found this a gripping short story that held my attention from start to finish. Definitely something to read on your commute to work.<br /><br />I'd say this is a very realistic portrayal of domestic violence, unlike the romanticised version in the Fifty Shades of Grey style fiction that seems to be quite popular.<br /><br />For those who think violent husbands deserve a bit of their own medicine as justice for their crimes...this story is definitely for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good excellent worth reading good not as good as Harry potter though it was a page turner overall good book
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I realize not everyone reads the Bible.  That's why I put 'you' in quotes.  This 'you' applies only if you, the reader of this review, choose to read a Bible.  I like that there are several Bible versions that can be downloaded for free so you can use them without an internet connection.  I like that there are many types of free Bible reading and study plans available for your use.  You can start or stop them at any time.  I love the &#34;catch me up&#34; feature because sometimes (a lot of the time) life gets in the way and you can get behind in your reading.  All you have to do is tap on &#34;catch me up&#34; and &#34;voila!&#34; you haven't missed a day.  You can let go of the guilt and stress you might face when looking at all those missed days.  There are many other features, more than I use.  You can highlight passages you like, post them on social media, and participate in dialogue with other readers.
B008JEJVXG|3.0|Nocturne combines cool 80s new wave stylistic touchstones (some have mentioned Psychedelic Furs; I'd add Here Comes Everybody-era The Wake and a bit of Low Life-era New Order) with a melodic indie/twee-pop sensibility (the Field Mice). You've got electric guitars and bass filtered through generous helpings of chorus and delay and occasionally synthetic-sounding drums co-existing harmoniously with lush, jangle-pop guitars. This may sound a bit anachronistic, but if you're a fan of the era, the references (and the results) are nevertheless satisfying. Even the cover art is an amusing 80s throwback, with a possible reference to the inside of Section 25's Always Now and the same font that's on the back cover and inner sleeve of Duran Duran's Rio. The songs themselves are generally artfully arranged, richly detailed, melodically engaging, and sometimes even wildly catchy.    The only serious drawback lies with the singer, Jack Tatum (who, for all intents and purposes, *is* Wild Nothing), as to these ears he has the light and wispy voice of a barely pubescent 12-year old boy. The sound of his voice ranges from nondescript to mildly annoying. I realize I may be the only person who is bothered by his singing, but let me put it this way: the singers in many of the bands that appear to have influenced this album had highly distinctive, powerful voices that instilled the music with soaring passion, and this kind of music is just crying out for someone like Paul Simpson or Ian McCulloch or even Andy McCluskey to take command of it and really push it into the stratosphere. Even Tatum's lyrics fail to make much of an impression. I really do like the music on Nocturne, but with a better singer this could easily be a 4 star album.
B002WY65W4|5.0|I love this movie.  And the fact that it was only $10 was perfect.  I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a great post-apocalyptic satire.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|If you like Chris Daughtry, you will like this CD.  My CD player ate my 1st one, so I had to buy another.  Tracks 10, 15, and 16 are my favorites.
B000002H97|5.0|My son is just learn how to play guitar and this will help him learn to Enter Sandman he does most of it by ear so he really excited about learning how to play it. We are certainly enjoying having him learn guitar, and that we get to listen to some of our music from my generation. lol
B004J4XGN6|5.0|The book outlines a clear and intuitive path to innovation for a startup and for large enterprises.  I highly recommend it.
B0030IIZ56|3.0|We had purchased this combo pack hoping the dvd would be used if we were traveling or something.  The blue-ray disc works great but when I tried the dvd it stops and locks up on the same spot every time.  I don't have problems with any other dvds in our blue-ray player so I think that this one was just defective.  I would have returned the whole thing but my son loves the movie so much I figured we would just keep the set.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|It's a great adapter, totally worth the money. Though I really wish it to be a bit cheaper on amazon.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is great for all ages. It is fun and has many levels. The graphics are great and the game is challenging too.
0670026603|5.0|I could not put this book down after the first couple of chapters. Louisa is determined to make things right and dedicated to doing so until the end.  This is a story of Louisa's growth through circumstances out of her realm of reason or understanding, at least prior to her encounter with Will Traynor.  This is a very special story and well worth your time.  I have not read a book this compelling in a long time.  Please treat yourself.
B002TO1Z8Q|4.0|I bought this because I had borrowed it from the library, and decided that I wanted to have a copy to own.  I work part time at a concert venue here in Seattle, and I actually worked as an usher when he brought this tour to Seattle.  It brought back memories of that show, which was a fantastic show! If anyone saw him on tour that year, I would recommend this DVD.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This book took me for a ride. I have never ever seen or even thought of this premise. I mean come on, a man killing people for wasting his time, GENIUS!
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|Predictable story but mildly entertaining. I finished it because I wanted to know how they caught him. The writing style is amateurish and choppy. But it's tolerable and I made  it through.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|ANY MOVIE HE MAKES IS A CLASSY AND ELGANT IN ALL WAYS COMES FROM HIM. PARTICULARY THIS MOVIE MAKE YOU THINK AND NOT JUST MATCH A &#34;MOVIE&#34; BUT TO UNDERSAND THE HUMAN MIND IN A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|A game changer, that is the consistent description that ran through my head as I listened to this album over and over. Not since Scenes of a Memory has any album, let a lone a Dream Theater album, seemed like such a game changer. A bold statement was made by the band when they decided to make this a self-titled album. It is a strong statement that we have yet to see these gentlemen max out their creative spark, but have just begun. And the album lives up to that. Not since When Dream and Day Unite has John Myung been this upfront as a presence in the mix. The \\"silent one\\" is that no more and it is glorious to hear. With the previous album, A Dramatic Turn of Events, I felt James Labrie was finally being considered in the lyric and music creation in that he was given songs that played to his vocal strengths. That continues with this album and in my opinion, his voice sounds better than it ever has. If this album marks a strong presence return for Myung and Labrie Mangini is finally introduced properly here with a thunderous explosion. The last album, he basically filled the drum parts as they were written. This time around, he was a full on part of the process and it shows. Jordan and John P. can't be left out, their ability to write choruses that are beautiful and catchy shine the brightest here. Petrucci's lyrics are on par with his best lyrical album, IMO, Images & Words. Myung and Labrie shinning brightly once again, Mangini fully integrated, Jordan and Petrucci raises the bar even higher, makes this album a game changer and their best overall album, IMO, since Scenes from a Memory.<br /><br />Below I broke down each song to speak to the strengths of each and weaknesses (only one song do I have any real complaint about and it is a minor one):<br /><br />False Awakening Suite - DT decided instead of using previously published music as an intro to their live performances, why not just write something of their own; thus the birth of False Awakening Suite. Equal parts dark and light, this is a perfect introduction to the album.<br /><br />The Enemy Inside - Their lead single and video from the album. This bravado riff heavy track has become one of my favorite tunes of theirs with its attacking style. It is one of the more simple riffs of theirs, yet when all members are fully engaged, it is classic DT. James sounding like James from Images and Words, great all around production. \\"Enemy\\" has an excellent chorus which sets the stage for many more excellent choruses' to come.<br /><br />The Looking Glass - One of two songs that channels DT's Rush influence. They have always toed the line of Rush-esque song writing, but here, they blatantly pay homage to the boys from Canada with an opening riff which is full-on Rush influenced. The result is a great new sound from the band. The only negative I can give for this track is the sudden end of the song. After the final lyric, it just seems to end abruptly.<br /><br />Enigma Machine - The final of two instrumentals on the album. Here, we get an even darker offering than False Awakening Suite. This is one of several songs where Myung is flexing a stronger presence than he has in a very long time in the mix.<br /><br />The Bigger Picture - Continuing the ballad trend from DTOE, the first ballad on the album and an excellent one at that. The last two albums DT has flexed their ability to write softer songs, something we knew from the past they could do, but rarely done this consistently good. Again, a nice chorus highlights an overall strong song. James once again in fine voice here.<br /><br />Behind The Veil - Probably the best chorus of any DT song to date. This song has all of the guys in absolute top form. This is no doubt, my favorite song on the album and probably my favorite song of theirs from the last 15 years. This song reminds me of their work from the first two albums.<br /><br />Surrender To Reason - The final homage to Rush on this album and IMO, the best one. Once again, a strong song powered by a strong chorus. Myung once again, very up front here. There is absolutely no wasted space here. The solo is very much Rush influenced and I can't remember Myung and Petrucci ever having this strong of a solo on a song. Probably the best final 90 seconds of a DT song ever.<br /><br />Along For The Ride - The final ballad on the album. Once again, strong chorus. There is no cheese here. I have always felt musically DT could write ballads with the best of them, but the lyrics were a little \\"processed\\". No longer, lyrics are standing strong with the music consistently now.<br /><br />Illumination Theory - The return of the 20 minute opus. I have to say, this is one of their tightest, best flowing opus' since I&W \\"Metropolis pt1\\". Absolutely beautiful, mid-song orchestra break and once again, a chorus which flows through the whole song and culminates in a grand finale. I love the silent break at the almost 19 minute mark, that sets up the grand finale
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This is a great app.  It turned my android smartphone into a kindle!  I only gave it four stars because the download was so difficult, otherwise its a five.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|I gave the macafee security 5 stars because I trust their programs. So whn I received my Kindle, I was the fist thing I downloaded.!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|Really great story! Two wonderful characters, Lara and Sadie! They keep each other on their toes! Loved the sheer absurdity of it!
0440246318|5.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels are AMAZING, and this is one of the best.  The twists and turns in the plot keep the reader guessing, and everything else in your life has to come to a stop while you finish this book.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I love this album. When I want to relax, I can put this on and listen for hours. I was not disappointed.
0761172726|5.0|i just love the Mom's Calendar! Its the best way  for me to juggle 3 other people schedule that why I love it! It helps with jugling everyone life!
B00F91H666|3.0|The pacing and visuals are pretty tight and fun, lots of suspense and 'jumpy' moments. But the script, oh man, the script is awful. Just bad bad dialogue. The actors deliver the lines ok, but you can tell they really didn't want to say them. Some lines and scenes are so cheesy that they made me cringe more than the Zekes.<br /><br />Overall is a good Z flick, but be warned of the cruddy script.
B007IGRV6U|5.0|Bought for my 3 year old Grandson.  He loves it!  Arrived quickly! Brio is top quality and will be enjoyed for many years.
B0045XGRQE|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars because it entertained me in an enjoyable way. It is what you 'd expect it to be...action packed, funny, ( I love Robert Downie Jr.) a bit sexy in some spots and just an overall enjoyable movie to watch.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|Downloaded this game because I like match three games and find it to be a fun variation of one. The graphics are well done and there are lots of levels, allowing players to begin with easier puzzles and advance as they wish. Perhaps the best thing to say is that the game is honesty free with hundreds of levels included<br />I do recommend this game.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|The previews made this movie out to be a lot better than it was! My husband and I were terribly disappointed in the way it ended!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I've read in places your first doctor will be your favorite doctor.  Well Season 1 is my first viewing of Doctor Who and I love that daft old face.  Love Rose and her adventures with Christopher Eccleston.  Love his wit, self depreciating humor.  David Tennant and Matt Smith are very good, but Christopher and this season is special to me.  Each and every Doctor Who fan has their favorites and this mine.  Hope you enjoy watching Eccleston's Adventures as I did.<br /><br />&#34;Nice to meet you&#34;. &#34;Now run&#34;!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun, fun, fun. Minions are just awesome. Though I wish I had more costumes for the minions. Run get bananas simple
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great product.  Set up easily, works with my phone, computer and iPad flawlessly.  Google really knows what they're doing.  I can't wait until they add more native apps to the line up.  Youtube is phenomenal.
B00E8B1358|5.0|Was a great movie! The kids came over we watched it together! Would recommend it to all GI Joe fans!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Thought that the book was as good or better than first! Now looking forward to the next 3! Really like his style of writing. I will probably read other books he wrote when I finish this series.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I should recommend this book for teens, and up. It was amazingly written and crafted together. The only problem was the story was to short! It was awesome, that's all I have to say
1612680011|4.0|This book will form the bedrock of a new way of thinking about money and how I want money to start working for me.  Reading this book can lead to a paradigm shift in your financial life.

B00B89LZ4C|5.0|HUGE fan of series. HUGE!. No, didn't buy thinking figurines sure to become worth thousands. Still basking in glow of series memories, and as I write this dear reader, the LAST episode, series finale, still a week away. So Walt is on my desk resurrecting moments of shows that I reevaluate, replay, just enjoy all over again.<br /><br />Think the series was edgy to point of telling truths many aren't comfortable with. Last time I admired a series as much was inTREATMENT on HBO. Really Good TV is rare. So I bought Heisenberg (Walt is in there somewhere...).
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book will pull you in and keep you waiting for more, and just when you figured everything out wham curveball. A very good book that will definitely make you want to read the third I finished the first book this month then had to read the second so I borrowed it from my sisters library of books and now am waiting to buy the third on payday. This is one trilogy well worth the wait.
B0001WANCM|5.0|...and written about this one. Just one of the best sports (road?)movies of all times.Heart warming and a movie one can watch again and again and again and...

B009IH0ICG|4.0|Once we were able to get this lit, it really made a difference in grilling on charcoal.  It wasn't always easy to get the newspaper to continue to burn, but once the paper lit, the chimney was very effective.  Does it need a deeper vented area so that the paper catches?  We live in a windy part of the world.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I thought that the book was great. It kept my interest and I didn't want to put it down. This is the first time I read any book by this author. My daughter turned me on to him.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone. It is encouraging whether you are a faithful person or not. It truly go especially a person hope and piece of mind.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I expected more information about the doctor and his life after his experience.  How his family was involved and how their life changed. The ending was abrupt to say the least.
B006VREHRS|4.0|I had no idea what to expect from Boardwalk Empire, but I LIKED it.  I tend to like mafia oriented movies.
0316247545|4.0|Great book. My girls 3 and 4 love this book. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is because a couple of pages have come loose. And have only owned it for 3 weeks.

B00E3D7WGU|3.0|The MDNA Tour (gotta keep it hip and current right) was a spectacle to witness live and in person.  Unfortunately, listening to it isn't quite as rewarding.  My complaints do not come from the song selection or the show itself--the mixing on this \\"album\\" is just terrible.  Back in the day, I used to hold my cassette recorder up to the TV to make cassettes of some of my favorite Madonna performances...and this release sounds like Madonna did exactly that.  It's essentially the DVD--with all it's added vocals, sound-effects, and intros and outros--released as an album.  The sound is muffed and, when played loudly, muddles together into a bass thumpin' mash.  A very poor quality product from the usually exceptional Madonna!

1250030951|5.0|With Fangirl, Rainbow Rowell has made it onto my pretty short list of &#34;I'll read anything they write,&#34; authors.<br />I like the worlds she creates very much. They are small worlds, sometimes existing only in the hearts/minds of two people. They are places I like to spend time in, populated by characters I want to know more about. I especially enjoyed Levi, he's not a conventionally handsome or perfect guy who never puts a foot wrong, but there was just something about him that made me root for him and made me smile inside and out, even when he screwed up. I tried to prolong this book as long as I could because I didn't want to leave that world.<br />Fangirl's world on the Nebraskan college campus is a touch larger than Eleanor and Park's world, and the main characters here are closer to the idea of mainstream but its still a unique place you will enjoy visiting for a while.

B000GL1BHO|4.0|I got this and two others from the same series for our three-year-old grandson and he loves them. The detail is amazing and the quality is excellent. They're also a great size for a toddler. The only issue with the Pteranodon is that it doesn't stand up by itself, so it's not quite as much fun to play with. On the other hand, I'm not sure how it could be re-designed to correct this issue, since it is, after all, a flying creature! HIghly recommended.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Loved this movie so much, I had to see it a few times in theaters.  Now that I own it, I must have seen it dozens of times.  It's got so many classic scenes, great acting, and that unforgettable Tarantino touch.  Easily one of the best Western movies in a long time, and my personal favorite movie of 2012.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|As a life long Sci Fi reader, (and that's now a long time), I find the wave of small publishing a bit disappointing.  Having read all of the classic great works, it is very hard to get excited about most of the outer space shoot up up that passes for SF these days.  I think that was why I was so stunned to enter in to Hugh Howey's world.  It takes personal stories, mystery, suspense, all against a backdrop of an expansive world and leaves you with a book you can't put down and a smile on you lips.  Speculative Fiction of the highest order.
0399159347|5.0|Loved this book - the characters were vivid and the story compelling.  You will want to share this book with your girlfriends, Mom's and Grandmothers - a story that crosses generational lines. I saw that it's going to be made into a feature film and I can't wait to see who they cast for each of the characters.
0865479410|5.0|I'm generally an upbeat kind of guy and consider myself a positive thinker . . . so when I came across THE ANTIDOTE: HAPPINESS FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T STAND POSITIVE THINKING (Canongate Books) by Oliver Burkeman, I was intrigued by the premise.The author contends that trying too hard to be happy is making us miserable. In fact, he presents many interesting examples in this book that may well be considered as a celebration of the power of negative thinking.<br /> Among them:* [Attending a motivational seminar featuring Dr. Robert Schuler] *Here it is, then,\\" Dr. Schuller declares, stiffly pacing the stage, which is decorated with two enormous banners reading \\"MOTIVATE\\" and \\"SUCCEED!\\", seventeen American flags, and a large number of potted plants. \\"Here's the thing that will change your life forever.\\" Then he barks a single syllable-\\"Cut!\\"-and leaves a dramatic pause before completing his sentence:  \\" . . . the word impossible out of your life! Cut it off! Cut it out forever!\\" . . .It is only months later, back at my home in New York, reading the headlines over morning coffee, that I learn the news that the largest church in the United States constructed entirely from glass has filed for bankruptcy, a word Dr. Schuller had apparently neglected to eliminate from his vocabulary.I also liked how he cited the work of Albert Ellis:* What Ellis had grasped about his unstated beliefs concerning conversation with women-an insight he would later extend to the beliefs that lie behind all instances of worry or anxiety-is that they were absolutist. To put it another way, it wasn't just that he wanted to be less shy, and that he wanted to be able to talk to women. Rather, he had been operating under the absolutist conviction that he needed their approval. Later, he would coin a name for this habit of mind: \\"musturbation.\\" We elevate those things we want, those things we would prefer to have, into things we believe we must have; we feel we must perform well in certain circumstances, or that other people must treat us well. Because we think these things must occur, it follows that it would be an absolute catastrophe if they did not. No wonder we get anxious: we've decided that if we failed to meet our goal it wouldn't merely be bad, but completely bad-absolutely terrible.And Burkeman shared this neat way of behaving at funerals:* Francisco parked the van, and we walked into the cemetery. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to what I was seeing. Many of the gravestones were only rough concrete slabs, or stubby pieces of wood, but almost none were unattached. Next to each, sitting in folding chairs, or cross-legged on the ground, were groups of two, three, or four people, sometimes more, holding murmured conversations and drinking tequila from paper cups. In one corner, a mariachi band in full costume strolled from grave to grave, serenading every headstone in turn. I stopped a woman who was carrying armfuls of rugs and chairs towards a nearby headstone, and asked what she was doing. \\"Oh, it's my mother,\\" she said brightly, gesturing at the grave. \\"We come every year.\\"I don't think that THE ANTIDOTE has made me a negative thinker. However, it has made me open to the possibility that there are many different ways to look at happiness.r that other people must treat us well.

0316056898|5.0|If you're a Tina Fey fan, you'll most likely love BOSSYPANTS (Reagan Arthur/Little, Brown)--her somewhat choppy look at her career, coupled with observations about parenting and a whole bunch of other subjects.<br /><br />Since I have always enjoyed Fey, I got a kick out of much of this book . . . I especially enjoyed her tales of her improv days. . . in addition, I liked reading about her days on the sets of both SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE and 30 ROCK.<br /><br />Many of her observations had me smiling, including these:<br /><br /> * Anyone who knows me will tell you that I am all about money. I mean, just look how well my line of zodiac-inspired toe rings and homeopathic children's medications are selling on home Shopping Network. Because I am nothing if not an amazing businesswoman, I researched what kind of content makes for bestselling books. It turns out the answer is \\"one-night stands,\\" drug addictions and recipes. Here, we are out of luck. But I can offer you lurid tales of anxiety and cowardice.<br /><br />* Politics and prostitution have to be the only jobs where inexperience is considered a virtue. In what other profession would you brag about not knowing stuff? \\"I'm not one of those fancy Harvard heart surgeons. I'm just an unlicensed plumber with a dream and I'd like to cut your chest open.\\" The crowd cheers.<br /><br />* There are a lot of different opinions as to how long one should breast-feed. The World Health Organization says six months. The American Association of Pediatrics says one year is ideal. Mothering magazine suggests you nurse the child until just before his rehearsal dinner. I say you must find what works for you. For my little angel and me the magic number was about seventy-two hours.<br /><br />My only disappointment with BOSSYPANTS had to do with the fact that I would have liked to have seen more about her work in the many movies that she has managed to find the time to make.

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Steelheart was definitely one of my most anticipated books of 2013 by far. I mean c'mon, who doesn't love superheroes? Anyway Steelheart is as amazing as I imagined it would be, if not better. Steelheart is a book that is super in just every possible way. Steelheart will make your heart pound, it will make you squee with delight, and most importantly it will make yearn the sequel. This is definitely one of the best YA novels I've read recently to say the least.<br /><br />I wasn't feeling the major love towards Steelheart when I initially because for some reason it wasn't really clicking with me. I decided to restart it a few days later and it was the perfect book for the occasion. I desperately needed to know what would happen next and I tried to read Steelheart whenever I had the chance. I was completely and utterly addicted to Steelheart, this is the YA novel I've been waiting for so long. I remember saying in the past that I need a YA superhero novel and woah, Steelheart is that book.<br /><br />The superheroes aren't so super after all, these superheroes are called Epics, and they have enslaved the human population. These superheroes are terrifying and yet I couldn't stop geeking out and gloating over them. I love how Sanderson focuses so much on villains in Steelheart, because this is a perspective we usually do not see in the media. Super heroes are always the one saving damsels in distresses and it was awesome to see them causing havoc for a change.<br /><br />I can definitely see why Sanderson's books have become extremely popular with readers across the globe. Sanderson knows how to craft an addicting story with just enough humor, suspense, and action. There is truly never a dull moment in Steelheart and I was extremely invested in the story.<br /><br />David is just the sort of protagonist I can relate to because in many ways he's very similar to me personality wise. He's extremely awkward, nerdy, and he isn't the best at handling situations with the opposite sex. David is very passionate about known everything about the Epics and I really admired his determination to learn every little detail about them. David tries to make comparisons to describe situations, but most of the time they were off-kilter and made me laugh. YA really needs more unconventional characters like David!<br /><br />Steelheart has one of the best beginnings I've read to date because it catches readers' attention immediately. Once you start Steelheart, there's no letting it go. This is the kind of book that will make laundry and chores pile up in your house until you finish. Steelheart is just what I needed to read and it definitely delivered. If Sanderson's other books are as epic as Steelheart, I'll definitely have a new favorite author.site sex.

B00B22ASUM|1.0|I purchased this book after reading Bob: no ordinary cat.  Much to my surprise and disappointment it is the same book.  Each chapter I started to read was the same as the first book.  I consider that a rip off.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun and very addicting. But I enjoy playing it when I have the time. And the minions are adorable.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is a great duo that have a pretty neat bromance.  It kind of shows how people in that industry will go to any lengths to win. Lie,  cheat,  steal.<br /> overall the cast shows a genuine chemistry.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Amazing from the first word to the last! It is amazing read I would definitely recommend this to someone. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing author and this book is a wonderful example of that!
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Another timeless classic with two great actors,  Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews.  A must see for children, and the scenery and animated parts make it a family film that will leave great impressions with your kids.  Enjoy.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This movie should have blown up at the theaters I think it's going to be one of those that does an INSANE amount in after theater sales as word spreads. Good cast, better twists!
B000669GAI|5.0|Wasn't buying too much music in the 90's.  musta been hiding under a rock.  I heard Pearl jam on the radio.  the songs I heard I liked. I could see they were happening by all the kids with pearl jam t-shirts.  finally got this album in 2011.  this is a great album.  Has a lot of their greats.  The Problem with Greatest hits albums is they usually miss some great songs.  And if you like the band and you are like me you start collecting the original albums to see what you're missing.  If you havent any pearl jam, this is a great place to start.  It will get you wanting more.  this is a double cd with 33 hits
B0063IH60K|4.0|we enjoy this game as it offers challenages for us both.  it is a matter of luck but there is some know how also.
B0045HCJ94|5.0|If you are a fan of Burton and Taylor this is the movie for you.  It is rather a &#34;dark film&#34; with all events taking place in Burton and Taylors home after a party.  The insults and remarks are sometimes laughable and then cutting, but all fit into a perfect mix of Burton, Taylor, George Segal and Sandy Dennis as two friends coming back to their house for an after party drink.  Sit back and enjoy a Burton- Taylor movie as great as they both were.
B00F35BV64|5.0|This movie has it all!  It does a great job of staying true to the original characters' personalities while adding new elements of action and intrigue.  Great for old and new trekkies alike!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Easy to use, earn points fast, it's free and I play for hours and hours every night. It's fun to play with others around the world with live chat. You can even exchange things you win, coins, free slots, and symbols you can collect. All around fun time.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|My favorite movie, I could watch it 100 times and never get bored. Such great acting by Meryl Streep as well she plays the role of Miranda flawlessly.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I waited for the movie, and waited for the DVD release, and have watched it over and over.  As a Zombie Movie fan, it met my expectations, and the zombies were unbelievable.  Having been from Philadelphia myself, the opening scenes are supposed to be in Philly, but wound up using a city in Europe, made up like Philly, using Philly street signs, bus signs, etc,  and Race Street where the film takes off with the attack, kinda makes me think &#34;gee what would I have done there on Race St, and where could I have run too&#34;  ha-ha.  Seriously, great effects, makeup, and storyline.  Highly recommend, and now can't wait for the sequel now in filming.  Sit on the edge of your seat and enjoy!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Great visual effects.predictable plot and an ending that was edited and short.I would not see number 2 if there was one.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I purchased this video in late July and did the workout 6-7 days a week. The first week is when I felt it the most, I was red faced and covered in sweat after every workout. I didnt go to level 2 untill about 11 days because I felt like I was still feeling the burn with level 1.  Once I did got to level 2 I discovered I was not going to get a good work out doing that level for the simple fact that so much of that level is down in either PLANK Position or Push UP Position and my wrist could not handle it at all. They would start burning or they would ache the next day.  So what happened, ..well I did my best to get through level 2 a few times then ultimately  I reverted back to level one with heavier weights. I also tried level 3. Level 3 is just ok, but again with the wrist. I basicly did level 1 for a little over a month with a handful of days trying level 2 or 3. My legs are pretty fatty so I deffinetly didnt get Shredded LOL. Even though I didnt  loose numbers on the scale I started to see a little deffinition peak through on nyquads and my chest and arms looked alot slimmer.  What I LOVE is that 20 mins is a Very Doable workout and after I got through week one all the other workouts flew by. I havent used it in about 2 1/2 weeks but will be starting level 1 again and trying to find a good SHORT cardio video to add to my routine.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I love google. I have a nexus 7, a nexus 4, and a chromebook; I use google drive for everything and since they released quick-office I have sworn off of owning a traditional windows PC ever again. I really, really, really wanted this to work (and expected it to). When they released this I thought it was too good to be true, and - in one very important area - it is. I couldn't connect the thing to my wireless network, which obviously renders it useless. I followed all of the troubleshooting recommendations, resent my router, tweaked the settings, tried connecting it repeatedly, and nothing.<br /><br />Now, I know that this is technology, and as someone who is tech-savvy, I understand that hiccups are to be expected; but something that I love about google devices (pure google devices - Nexus devices and chromebooks) is that THEY JUST WORK. I'm sure that if I had spent hours trying to correct this issue, I'd eventually have found a way to connect the chromecast and all would be well, but I expect better from google because they have provided me better. If I can connect a dozen devices to my wifi with no trouble at all, I should be able to connect this to it as well. I envisioned a plug, connect, and stream process that was seamless - or at least relatively seamless and painless. If my expectations had been met this would be a 5 star review and I'd have bought two more for every monitor in my home.<br /><br />As a concept, I'm certain that this model is going to revolutionize how we stream media; being able to carry around something the size of a usb-stick, plug into any HDMI enabled monitor as long as you have a wireless connection, and then streaming all of your personal content from a smartphone, tablet, or PC...It is an awesome concept which I'm sure will be perfected by someone soon, it just isn't there yet.

B00D3LA5WG|5.0|I found this to be an excellent movie, although I didn't care for the ending.  But I loved the boys and think it should be required watching in schools.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Even as an adult..you have got to love this game.  It was so much fun and loved playing it on the Kindle!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My girls, she 5 & 8, beg to play this all the time. Lots of tools to change the characters hair. It even makes me giggle sometimes at the faces they make. I'm glad I got it free though. I would have been disappointed to pay $2.99 & only game 6 characters.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I can even know where to begin. I feel that the reviews that are praising this book are fabricated and i dont want any other innocent person to get suckered, just like i did. so i hope this review helps someone in the future.
B007MB5OCE|1.0|If the author had stuck to the main story, which I found somewhat entertaining, I might have enjoyed it more.  However just because this shallow character managed to survive 100 years does not mean that he could even possibly been involved in every historical event of the era personally is too ridiculous to swallow.  I have suffered through this book and wish I had not wasted the time
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|The game is very cute and fun to play however it has a freezing problem. On any given level of will freeze and the only way to continue is to totally shut down the kindle. The graphics are great but the lack of the option to shrink the page makes it difficult to see where you are headed or what to aim at.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|2012 proved to be a horrible of year in the music industry. No artists or legend has ever felt that hardness and heartbreak further than Elton John. With so many losses from artists he had befriended from Donna Summer from Cancer, Levon Helm of The Band, the unbelievable Whitney Houston and her passing before the Grammy Awards, to friends and people he had lost who worked behind the scenes of music from the deaths of Dick Clark years after his stroke in 2004 of American Bandstand fame and Don Cornelius from Soul Train, which Elton had appeared in 1973 on the show performing Bennie & The Jets. Elton had so much heartbreak he had faced. But what was suppose to be a joyous year for him and Bernie Taupin which would celebrate 45 years of songwriting together, proved to be sadness down the road. It set the intimate scene for what had been his strongest record since the 90's with the albums Made In England & The One.<br /><br />The Diving Board is definitely a straight forward return to the simplicity of the piano and what made Elton a great performer in the first place. The songs and record shows the down to Earth stripped-down appeal from the piano well, and the somber moods from the piano, guitar and drums. Elton shows that appeal well from his songwriting on great songs that range well from the moods from the Blues on songs like Mexican Vacation (Kids In The Candlelight,) and The Ballad Of Blind Tom, which focuses on younger artists thinking they have fame but get screwed up along the way like Lindsay Lohan who has no career right now and Justin Bieber whom thinks he has everything but has lost it in his fame. The moods from the ballads speak loud in the piano as well from songs like the beautiful and somber Home Again, to the opening song Oceans Away and the mood-shattering The New Fever Waltz. It definitely shows well from the intimate set of the song. The settings from each dream track each work out too from the settings of the songs. While My Quicksand might be the one off-shoot that might not work, the feeling catches up with you in the song well.<br /><br />What David Bowie tried to attempt with The Next Day earlier this year, Elton John took it very well to that next level with The Diving Board. It definitely holds up nicely with Elton John's classic records from the past well. While everyone from Katy Perry and Rihanna try too hard to overexpose their music and they became tiring and more wasted, Elton still has found his heart well and wanted to make the records he has wanted too. While he is past his success from the 70's, Elton has no signs of stopping. I absolutely recommend this record not only because it is one of Elton John's finest masterpieces, but we really do not have legends making music for the way it should be heard anymore. What T-Bone Burnett did with Elton John and Leon Russell on The Union 3 years ago, he took it further with The Diving Board. We really do not have legends anymore delivering masterpieces, but I am glad Elton John is still standing with great strength after all this time.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: A<br /><br />Price: A 1/2-<br /><br />Mastering: A 1/2-<br /><br />Overall: A-e one off-shoot that might not work, the feeling catches up with you in the song well.<br /><br />What David Bowie tried to attempt with The Next Day earlier this year, Elton John took it very well to that next level with The Diving Board.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The third book in the Crossfire series was just as hot as the first two.  So many people have been giving this book poor reviews but I thought it was good.  Eva and Gideon's story continues and at first it took me a while to remember where the second book, Reflected in You, left off (because of the long wait for the release) which then made it hard for me to get into the third book.  Once my memory was jogged and after the seriously hot sex scenes I was hooked back in!<br /><br />Several questions were answered from the previous books but this book left us asking several more.  (Sylvia announced that she will do a total of 5 books in the Crossfire series)<br /><br />This book takes off from when Eva finds out that Gideon killed Nathan for her, and the struggles of them trying to move forward while everyone keeps trying to drag them backwards.  They must pretend that they are not back together while the police and reporters are still digging into their lives.  They must learn to trust each other and find a way to make it back to one another.<br /><br />I liked how Eva was able to tone down her jealousy and was able to talk through some of the issues she was having with Gideon which made her seem more mature.  Gideon is still a complex man with so many secrets still to be uncovered.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading the final two books in the series!<br /><br />Drink of choice:  Appletinis

B00F5FEZTC|5.0|It has been a very long time since Elton John made a new record. His music has remained the one constant that has delivered more greatly than any of the artists in the industry today. But last year proved to be a year of tragedy and sadness for Elton. Instead of having to celebrate his 45th anniversary of songwriting with Bernie Taupin, it turned to be a mammoth year of sadness for Elton. He lost so many artists he had befriended from Donna Summer, Robin Gibb of The Bee Gees, to people whom he briefly had a spotlight with from Don Cornelius of Soul Train, that Elton had made a appearance on back in 1973, to the passing of Whitney Houston before the 2012 Grammy Awards. Elton had so much heartbreak and sadness he had to swallow his heart with. Nevertheless, it set the scene to be what would be a simplistic album from Elton John, and truthfully it would be one of his finest in years.<br /><br />The Diving Board, Elton John's latest album is simplicity on motion, showcasing a intimate mood and mood-shattering motion from each and every song from start to finish. Every track is strong from the piano well, and you hear the motion top to bottom. The album showcases his finest record since the 90's greats like Made In England and The Big Picture. The tracks range nicely from the piano with ballads like The New Fever Waltz to the elegance of the lead single Home Again, all the way to the blues with Mexican Vacation (Kids In The Candlelight.) He also shows that piano well on his feelings of the younger generation and artists that have lost their talent like Lindsay Lohan and Justin Bieber on The Ballad Of Blind Tom and Oscar Wilde Gets Out. Every song makes it a strong and classic record that really sounds better than almost all the albums that have came out of the music industry from wasted acts like Rihanna, Beyonce' Knowles and Chris Brown, that don't even have the courage to make a album for its strength in song alone.<br /><br />All in all, this is definitely the best album of 2013 and it sometimes takes a legend to show that the younger generation is missing out on real talent from the songs alone. While Elton John is well past his point at making albums for the public and his smash era of songs from the 70's, he definitely knows how to hit one smack out of the ballpark. I absolutely loved The Diving Board not only because of the songs alone, but we really have had songs lately on radio that have lagged real emotion. I absolutely recommend this album for any die hard Elton John fan, and for those who have never even heard what made Elton John a legacy in the first place.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: A 1/2-<br /><br />Price: A<br /><br />Mastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: A-bum of 2013 and it sometimes takes a legend to show that the younger generation is missing out on real talent from the songs alone.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King fans are in for a treat with Doctor Sleep; it's much better than I could have imagined.  I anticipated for months how this sequel to The Shining might possibly play out, and my imaginings never came close to predicting how this one might shake out.  Plan to read this one when you are sure to have a uninterrupted time, as you will not want to put this one down until you've finished the entire novel.<br /><br />So yes, Danny Torrance, the little boy with the \\"the shining\\", is back in the sequel. He's all grown up now. He's battled alcoholism, and is winning the fight.  He works at a facility for hospice patients called, the Rivington House in a small NH town.  To his coworkers, he's referred to as, Doctor Sleep, as he, along with Azee the cat, have a way of helping guests there leave this world behind when the their time has come.<br /><br />As Danny has aged, and since he has stopped drinking, his \\"shining\\" abilities are not as powerful as they once were. There is, however, someone who has been communicating with Danny in unusual ways, whose \\"shining\\" abilities far exceed anything Danny was ever capable of.  Her name is Abra (Abby) Stone. Abra, even before she could walk and talk was trying to warn others about bad things that would and did happen.  At just 11 years old, her powers are stronger than ever, and her parents and Danny fear for her safety.<br /><br />Rattlesnake, Rosie the Hat, Snakebite Andi, Crow Daddy, Walnut, Mr. Business Man, Mr. Dealer Man and more, are a motley crew, part of a group called: The True Knot, the Steam Heads.  The group travels cross country in RV clusters, and to the average person, their attire of cheap sun glasses, fishing hats, stretch pants and attention getting bumper stickers makes them appear like many other retirees traveling in RVs.  Believing that they are regular folks would be dangerous, because they really are not interested in seeing the sites in their RV. They have a special agenda, and a special interest in talented young \\"shining\\" ones like Abra.<br /><br />Although Doctor Sleep is a sequel to The Shining, it can be read as a stand-alone novel.  I was happy that there were references to the Overlook Hotel, and also to other characters from The Shining. Most were referred to briefly like: Jack and Wendy (Danny's parents), Richard (Dick) Hallorann, who saved the lives of the Torrance family when the Overlook was destroyed by fire. Also mentioned was Mrs Massey, Room 217, Horace Dorman, as well as Tony, Danny's imaginary friend. It was good to have their names reappear, even briefly in Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />For me, this one is \\"classic Stephen King\\". When I read phrases like \\"eyes dripping and bloated\\",  I smiled. This is the Stephen King, I love the best.  READ IT!n talented young \\"shining\\" ones like Abra.<br /><br />Although Doctor Sleep is a sequel to The Shining, it can be read as a stand-alone novel.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book. It is well written, and hard to put down. I would have liked a more conclusive ending but well worth the read.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I loaned my first DVD and didn't get it back. Loved the movie so much, I just had to have another copy. No one can borrow this one unless they leave their youngest child as hostage! Movie is in mint condition, and I've already watched it twice.
B0017VG66I|5.0|Shane was the actuall gift, but you can never go wrong with the Duke..two classy men..Love them both - the men and the movies.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A beautiful fantasy that makes up for in imagination what it lacks in emotional depth or descriptive power.  It made me wish the night circus did exists and hits the part of all of us that longs for more magic and connection.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works well and easy to install, but limited on apps - YouTube and Netflix.  You can broadcast web browser from a standard laptop.
0553801473|5.0|Absolutely love all these books in the series. Just waiting for Amazon to have the DVDs on sale so I can buy the series. The book, sent by Premier Booksellers in Tennessee, was in perfect condition and arrived earlier than expected. Just love Amazon!!!!
0767817729|5.0|Omg I saw this when i was younger..It is well worth the watch...Kevin Costner is excellent.....OMG the move is one of the great ones.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My friend recommended it to me and I loved it. It was better than most romance story of books. It was great!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am an 8th grade student who hated to read after this book in which I read over 3 days I fell in love with the characters the story and the author...
B00BV5FVR0|5.0|Great ending to the Oryx and Crake saga; interesting outlook and future left to the readers. Will never have the full answer, just the way Atwood does it.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|Best songs from her repertoire with the exception of Gipsy and Gold Dust Woman.  Great to sing along to or play loudly to relieve stress in traffic.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|If you find yourself running 10 tabs in your browser just to keep track of your sporadic thoughts this add-on to Evernote is the solution. I have never felt so organized in my life!  The web search tool allows you to search and extract the information you need and store it exactly where you need it. Then you can add comments similar to the adobe text boxes. Suddenly my need for mini-notebooks, accordion folders, hi-liters, and Sticky notes seems unbelievably excessive not to mention wasteful!!  EVERNOTE and Skitch are practical web tools for students, secretary's, and anyone who wants less clutter, more productive research tools, collaborate on projects with coworkers, teams, family members or just solo projects. WHETHER YOU USE THIS TO PLAN A FAMILY REUNION OR TO RESEARCH CURLING IRONS..... THERE ISN'T A BETTER PLANNING TOOL ON THE MARKET TO DATE.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Great time killer. Another one to watch if you're not careful. Very easy to spend money to extend your play time.<br /><br />Like anything, just have fun with it.

B00E9PMMX0|5.0|Please get over yourselves already. These are the restored, updated, and upgraded director's cut special editions lovingly and meticulously improved in every way from what was released in theaters 36 years ago.<br /><br />Just look at all the documentary footage for the Special Edition releases and tell me if these versions aren't an improvement in all aspects of the film. There are no original versions of the film anymore. As was pointed out in those documentaries, the original films all had different little bits and pieces. There was no consistency. Everyone saw a slightly altered version of the film whether it was music, sound or visuals.<br /><br />These new cuts were the first time that every different version of the film was finally incorporated into a single print. The original film is still in there plus so much more additional improvements were added.<br /><br />This is the definitive version of the Star Wars saga. I don't believe that the majority of fans would want to see the old unaltered versions. There is no money to be made by catering to a small but vocal group of nagging spoiled brats who think that George Lucas ruined their childhood memories. Seriously?<br /><br />Yes, these are the same films that are already available on both Blu-ray and DVD separately, but this is the first time that both formats are included in one package. If you haven't seen or own these films yet and you have children, this is the best option and the best version.<br /><br />If you want to see the original unimproved basic raw versions, pull out your VHS tapes and laser discs, which I still own too. Since you are all such purists who only want to see the old versions you should watch them on the old formats too, to give it that extra nostalgic feel.
B004Y5AV4M|3.0|I read the book and found it entertaining but nothing special. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends but enjoyed reading a book about the times.
B00005Y7PS|5.0|The guitar on this album is awesome.<br />Take the time to listen to it a second time !!!<br />A must in your Black Sabbath collection.
B00CC1JXYE|5.0|I didn't want to pay the 60$ for a the Samsung case and let me say this case is quality and it it works !!!!!!!! Its easy to take the phone out and put back in. It is really a quality case for half the price.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If you do not have Comcast onternet connectivity, do not buy this product.  I burned $35 on this for nothing.  Very unhappy with it.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Elton has been around for nearly five decades now. If we compare his new production to some of the material out there, or if we look at how little recognition he has received for most of his work, we have another opportunity to see what quality is. With the help of one of the best producers around, his long-time partner, and Elton and his piano, \\"The Diving Board\\" is just pure gold.<br /><br />Everything in this album will make you feel good, even the themes of nostalgia and what some people might perceive as sadness, don't come across as negative reflections, but more like appreciations of what life has given you. His melodies are certainly some of the most gorgeous instrumentation on a classic album, and the cuts just get better and better after every listen. Yes, the melodies are grand, and the lyrics are fully complementary. This record is nothing short of a masterpiece.<br /><br />Yes, Elton's voice is not the instrument it was before, but his vocals are part of the contemporary world he is a part of. Elton represents the best of the past, and he makes you look back and reflect, and he is telling us that he is still standing, giving us more of what we always loved, and my only wish is that his peers now recognize his latest contribution to the music world not for being hip or different, or for providing music for laser shows, or for some irrational justification, but let's give him his due for appreciating his talent, his longevity, and his inspirations to others to be the best they can be. Here's the album of the year, and a strong candidate to be on a list of the top five albums of all time.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Amazing movie,  this movie is on my watch list for sure and I will watch it as soon as possible
B006LSZECO|4.0|His side/Her side.<br />Could not imagine who was the bad one.<br />Kept reading to find the answer.<br />How love can turn good to bad.
