B00480GZ9I|5|Great lights, just difficult to install on our Subaru - just wish they lasted longer, but they are bright!
B0030AD6WG|5|Came on time and is working
B007N6YRYO|5|No more knots on my head from the hood falling.  Thank you.  Oh yea, fit perfectly.
B003FOPY0O|1|The double sided tape that is supposed to stick to you dash can't even hold the vase up without water or a flower in it at all.
B0093LYB20|5|Perfect for my blind spots on my convertible
B0002U1TVW|5|Sometimes you need a little elbow grease to get a good shine.  This stuff works.  Been using it since I put my first coat of wax on my used '87 Chevy Celebrity.  Long lasting and protects the paint through harsh, salty Coastal Maine winters.  Just get it and wax your car.
B000CSWCAG|3|This product does work. It's does get rid of the smoke smell, and I never noticed a weird smell from spraying it. But I will say that the can it come in is poorly made. I didn't get to use mine very long. Only lasted a month or so before the sprayer stopped working and it was unusable.
B00EZ9Y33W|2|Fuse keeps popping, rechecked wiring and conections, no direct moisture
B00WUG1A9C|1|Product didn't fit properly
B00OPMIR2M|5|Works well and it has an easy to see display. I recommend it and I consider it a must have to have in your car.
B008C7CIBC|5|Great value. delivery was quicker than expected
B00C3OCI88|4|He likes it for the summer. Too hot to wear a long sleeve jacket.
B011YWW0T6|5|I bought this for my boyfriend & he absolutely loved it! Fits perfectly in his car!
B000N5VVNM|2|The nerf bars themselves are great.  Tough, durable, great looking but here is the thing...  THEY ARE A NIGHTMARE TO INSTALL.  Not one of the bolt holes line up.  You will fight every single one of them.  From putting together the heel guards to putting it on the bike.  NOT ONE hole lines up.  They need some serious overhaul on their production.  Its a great product but they need to fix this issue.  Seriously, this took me hours and hours to install.  Should have been an hour max.  Not to mention I stripped out a bolt trying to pry the top of the nerf bar in place to bolt it to the subframe.  I had to take it back off and tap the hole to start again.  I dread the day I have to take these off and put them back on for any reason
B007QQRKXG|4|good set
B00UHD4HJA|1|not at all what is shown in the pictures
B00EWSE5HA|5|So easy to install even a woman can do it. Watched a YouTube how to video, needed one screw driver and in ten minutes old visors were removed and replaced with new ones.
B00KDTDLNQ|5|AE 86!
B00K53D5KE|5|Seems to be a good working battery, best cold-cranking amps, good warranty, works well so far...
B0024E6V9E|5|Thanks
B00ZBC45MQ|4|Really great helmets. We bought 2 for my wife & I. The Bluetooth works fantastic. We rode to Sturgis & back (2000) and the helmets performed excellent.
B0000AXYLP|5|as advertised
B00Y5N5YA4|5|Great part no issues
B00EJRV58G|5|The Tucson shorty leather gloves fit perfectly, I usually wear large and that's what I ordered. The Palm has a little padding which soaks up any vibration. Great gloves.
B003HB29GW|3|Look great but have problems with them staying on. We lose one or two about every other week... Thank goodness we can always find them!
B001AIZ5HY|5|Set aside time. Do it right. I used painters tape. Three layers. The directions recommend two or more layers. Use three or more.
B000C2AMWW|4|So my fault but I bought the wrong one. This is the exact style and type you would get from auto zone or discount auto parts. I needed the 8.25 not the 9.25. Same brand and everything as you would auto zone. Seems flimsy, but does the job. It is actually a silicon type rubber but at first glance looks like cardboard. I did my differential change myself and I would buy this again on my next change, just the right size. Only giving 4 stars as I feel it should be thicker, but again it is not leaking so I am happy. Btw, my truck is a 07 dodge dakota SLT 2wd v6.
B00HG2UEBA|5|Easy to install, great protection for my bumper, looks more sophisticated than a bumper hitch
B008OJ5HGG|5|Works great, deploys and stows quickly and easily.
B00MJ43ZQG|1|Does not fit Mazda 3 sedan... Too long on front windows.
B009S95ESW|5|Worked perfect on 09 Versa. Actually made better than the ones from Nissan directly!
B00DJ5KEF4|4|My wife uses this to charge her cell phone on the motorcycle. Works great.
B0006FKFMC|1|does not work!
B00FKFJ330|4|Thought it would fit my window considering its a jumbo size but still a little to small its cute though
B0100VTE3M|5|I just bought this, and it is so effective! Normally, when I leave my car at the train station or in a parking lot, by the time I come back it’s hot enough to fry an egg. It is easy to handle and much more efficient than window sunshades.
B0091OE6K6|5|These work!  I replaced another brand that kept popping off with these.
B00I8IKIAI|5|Reasonable priced air filter!
B006STTIUU|5|This works exactly as intended, to apply polish with one side and buff with the other.  It's super soft and hasn't left lint on my black motorcycle.  The stitching around the edges isn't perfect but it's a &#34;rag&#34; and that doesn't affect its performance.
B001AY0YO2|5|I was nervous that it might be too tight but the fit was great. Easy to put on and take off. A little challenging to stuff back in the storage bag but not impossible. It was a good buy!
B001U7E030|4|The original step on our trailer was a very long step down when exiting.  This double step has made that first step much shorter and safer for us old folks.  The steps come with no mounting hardware and no instructions.  They also are heavy so installation requires both some hardware and strength.  As other reviewers have noted the steps are about half an inch narrower then the mounting brackets on our trailer.  Rather than fabricating spacers I mounted the steps against one mount and then slipped a 1/2&#34; nut over the 3/8&#34; carriage bolt to take up the extra space on the other side.  I saw no need to exactly center the steps.  This mounting method required a couple slightly longer carriage bolts on the side with the nut as a spacer.  The bolt holes lined up with my existing holes so no drilling was required.  I also needed to cut a little of the trim on the bottom of the trailer because these steps were slightly wider than the old step.  I mounted these by myself but it would have been much easier with a helper because of the weight and working under the trailer.<br /><br />The steps I received are not exactly like the picture.  Go to the Stromberg Carlson web site to see the actual picture and also see the detailed dimensions.<br /><br />Would have given these five stars except for the hard installation.  I would not recommend trying to mount these yourself unless you are an experienced handyman.  Once complete we are very happy with the improvement.
B0051XBNDY|5|it is worthing the money
B00CM589B8|5|Great Buy.
B0009IQZPW|5|As expected
B0012ZEZ8A|5|very good!
B00WZ0YKV8|5|Nice quality, looks great
B00LP7RY9M|5|Excellent
B006MX81M8|4|I thought the arm rest covers would be included
B00BE5INC2|4|As expected
B00J868VE4|5|Works great and looks great.  Only wish the element was a little thicker.  Sometimes gets a tad of oil on the intake from the air coming throught the breather bolts.  But does it's job and looks great.
B00B0QWXW6|5|just as described
B004RDN2YC|5|Great Thanks
B01256RQ3A|5|way bigger than I thought but well worth it. my boyfriend is going to love it!
B004A56K32|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B002Q907QU|5|Best oil ever.<br />Sincerely,<br />Frye lover, Filson wearer, Saddleback owner
B001DET91S|5|painted a bitphenix phenom with this and a nice skull stencil. i think it looks good.
B00U2CDJV8|5|worked as stated. I was on forest service road in back country of CO, came across a guy and family with new Dodge truck, with dead battery, when i pulled out the Cyntur, he laughed said he had jumper cables to use with my jeep. I hooked up device, He told me and his family, &#34;if this works I'l buy a dozen&#34;. Hooked it up told him to start the truck, laughingly he did, started right up, mouth fell open, family laughed &#34;with him&#34; and said, you have a lot of buying to do. what happened to him was my reason for getting one as I'm often on back roads and no phone service. I'm buying several for friends and family members for Xmas.
B008G5AA7E|3|They were as advertised HD construction! But no direction or mounting bolts.
B005Z8HAUK|5|Slime products are, in general, great so it was a no-brainer to go with their tire inflation device. I love the little box it comes in, it makes storing it in our vehicles and in the garage very easy. We are an off-roading/overlanding loving family and have more than used our money's worth from this thing. It makes airing down tires for better traction so quick and easy. Airing them up again once we're headed for pavement is nice too, I don't think either takes more than 2 minutes.
B00AFJO91W|3|I'm giving it a 3 star only because I sprayed it on and went through a car wash and it didn't get the bugs off. I used a lysol wipe and to my surprise that cleaned the bugs off better then Wizard. I'm going to try it again. Maybe I'll get a better result.
B00PVM6ZA6|5|Love the scale works wonderfully, has accurate reading, great little product
B0032DBQHS|5|good!
B000P72HG8|5|Happy with purchase. Good service.
B00YFQPE9C|5|Item arrived as described in the sales ad.....it appropriately met my expectations!
B002S3WA1Y|5|This is a great relay at a great price of less than $12. Fit perfect and works properly. Would recommend to anyone.
B000CQOIVO|3|Does the trick for the money.
B00N9LMXUC|5|Works as described.
B00BZ8JSDQ|4|Fit good.
B000BO54WO|4|Since purchasing these, I have been able to find an equal product locally at a lesser price.
B003UMJJ6G|3|Have these on a WR250R. Cool... until they burn out. After only 5 months and 2,000 miles one of mine is toast. If I open it up and push on the LEDs they work again. I had assumed the heat from my exhaust was the culprit. Then I notices a section of LEDs on my DRC Edge2 Tail light are out already as well. No heat to blame that on. Only about 700 of those 2000 miles were hard core dirt and the bike never went down. I think they just aren't up to the stresses and vibration put on motorcycle parts. I did order another set because I like em when they work. But if I don't get A LOT more miles and months out of the new ones, that's it.
B00FS0WGU4|5|So far i dont have any problem with ring. Good i will recomend this
B0050QIJ0W|1|thy are cheep i got to set's for bikes that i worked on<br />but thy looked cool on the bike's and that is what sold the bike's<br />i still gave them a one star review over all hard to put on<br />and thy pop open in the hot sun looks is all thy are the ones<br />with the light's in them are the best one's that was a plus<br />for at night .
B00CF2CTMI|5|Great headlights bulbs would buy again
B000H6QWWC|5|work great!
B000C16XLC|5|easy install perfect match  couldn't be happier
B00VOL4LR2|5|I live the helmet thanks very much!
B002MPUWCW|4|Can't comment on how warm it is yet however the actual jacket isn't exactly as pictured. The picture shows the emblem Vega on lower back however the jacket has no emblem. Seems like good jacket.
B00WKZXXW0|5|Great product, quality and price!
B00K2QQNAI|3|Not actual size as mentioned it's only 6 1/8&#34; wide by 6 5/8&#34; tall but awesome customer service.
B005CCJYEY|5|Good helmet
B00KGGTF9U|5|I was offered a sample of this product for review purposes on my blog, here is an excerpt of that article: …When traveling and you have your pets with you a helpful tip is to blast the air conditioner as much as possible while you find a shady place to park. It is helpful if you can back into a shady parking spot, so the shade protects the back windows. Be sure to pour a bowl of water for the pets, and set up the blind to block out the sun in the front windshield. If you can, put up some baby blind sunshields on the side windows too. And try to be away from the vehicle for no more than 15 minutes. This has proved very helpful when we are traveling with our pets and both of us have to go in; otherwise one of us would stay in the vehicle where we could open doors and windows if it got too hot. For those of us who have to park outside at work or at the grocery store you can certainly feel much more comfortable with a blind like this at work, not only protecting your vehicle from the onslaught of the sun but also to prevent visual access to the front of your car (if thieves can’t easily see inside they are less likely to break in). With a sunshade blind like this you will no longer have the inconvenience of trying to drive with a hot steering wheel or sitting down in a pair of shorts or bathing suit on a burning hot seat.<br />The first thing that appealed to me was the attractive silver case for the blind – it is really quite small, round and is very easy to store in the vehicle without taking up even half the space that our old reflective one did. Also, the case does not attract pet hair – another plus. It is nice to know that the screen will always be safe from damage like scratches or pokes from things in the vehicle and it will always be clean each time we bring it out to use it.
B0006IX87S|5|Used it on a long car trip (9300 miles).  Worked GREAT!
B00HDE3G52|3|Won't give 5 stars due to fact you need to modify it to fit if your running silicone boost hoses. Also I am a mechanic so I was able to hook up no problem after modify the product. There's no manual so if you have zero experience it could be a big problem. Also washers are joke the kept binding up on high boost apps. Other than that not bad for price.
B000BQSL5E|4|Works great
B00R6UOYEA|5|Awesome product very reasonable price made my truck looks better
B00CVFIIZG|5|This key cover adds an element of protection from scratches and dings. I appreciate being able to color-code my keys. This is especially helpful if you own more than one MB car, because all of their keys look the same.
B00LH82F84|5|Item was received just as described.
B00CCYWJQK|5|Wish I had this clever device when I was RV'ing full time.. Works great and no mess!
B00A6GHI30|5|These filters fit the 500 pioneer from honda. Had a hard time finding this out every time it listed a different kind.
B000RXX46W|5|great product
B00AQG7X2G|2|Put them in travel trailer and tried them in Camaro and did not work when trailer was hooked up to my Yukon but worked when I was hooked up to a Ford pickup. So if you have a Ford rig work great GM rig does not work brake light blinkers work just not running lights
B004GEG1UE|3|Replaced my broken handle, however it does not operate as smoothly as the OEM handle. It feels like it could break sooner than the last handle, but its working for now.
B00EDFM66E|5|Install them in my travel trailer and they put out awesome like recommend putting them in every trailer battery doesn't drain down at all
B00EOU2LOK|5|As described
B000C846U0|5|Works well!
B00EKRWJ6C|5|Have had no problems getting accurate air pressure & tire temperature readings while driving.
B00OM3EXQI|5|Great looking bags at a great price
B00JEP8NOW|1|One full sticker came off first day!
B00306YGNI|2|Rip every time I use them, even for light jobs. Waste of money.
B000XRHRZQ|5|perfect fit and condition
B001PLWS9Y|4|The switch is nice and it is clean. It should have came with instructions. drilled a 15/16 hole and filed two notches in it.
B00B7ORHNG|5|thanks for a great product. i love it
B0010E3IWC|5|made my car smell a lot better, got it from a smoker and its been really hard to get the smell out.
B01237AQSS|5|As of today, I still haven't been able to actually put this  hammock up and get to chill in it, but I've gotten it out and plotted how to do so. I've been looking for just the right hammock for a while and this actually delivered more than I knew I was looking for! I didn't realize when I ordered it, but this is actually a double size and will give tons of room. I also didn't expect tree straps to come with it and was stoked to have them included upon arrival. I'm impressed that it stores so small and is easy to get back into the attached storage bag. The fabric and straps both seem very strong and the color is bright, but not neon - just what I wanted. I'm super excited to spend extra time this fall among the trees! I got this at a discount for my honest review.
B00HDMEUBS|4|Runs big for my Jazz 2015 seat. But it works!
B0023VH8SG|5|Good
B00D8DR0AO|5|This is great stuff. I mix up about 1/8 capful per bottle of water in my Solo hand sprayer and &#34;voila.&#34; I can wipe down my car in a matter of minutes (under 5). Great after a day out driving in a state where we cannot legally wash our cars in the driveway. Just a few ounces of water and a microfiber cloth.
B005BNP7UO|5|plugs n play
B000A8JLO8|5|So far, so good
B00OPU5UO2|5|Very Well made.
B0083G3AXC|5|This worked fantastic during our whole vacation attached to our zero gravity chairs! Easy to put on and take off. Perfect! Nothing more to say!
B0013JVZ7O|1|After buying 3 of these I still have 2 after 2 years (1 went to daughter). Just used both of them today & they read 6 pounds different. So I am either over inflated or under inflated or close and I have no idea which. I guess I will try to find a better gauge.
B00Y1HTI0Q|5|Very easy to program, save hundreds
B000BZX92K|5|Good product.
B000GBGNUO|5|Thinner than the original lift struct for rear hatch on 2002 Honda Odyssey but it works! Replace both at the same time.
B00HSRFD00|3|Very bright but didn't take long before some of the diodes started flashing and had to replace all of them.
B005GOM2I8|5|Definitely the product to use when sealing fiberglass. Just be careful as it sticks to anything the first time permanently!
B0022SHR6I|2|Nose pads are low and non-adjustable therefore only practical for people with higher nose bridge, otherwise it would just keep sliding down on your face. I am asian and these sunglasses wears much lower than needed. Credit for build quality though.
B00RH3AMIS|5|:)
B00BAZCCX2|1|These bulbs turn off constantly for no reason at all, one bulb will turn off then I have to turn my lights on and off to get it to come back on then the other bulb will turn off and I have to do the same thing and sometimes both of them turn off and won't turn back on for a good 15 minutes, these bulbs literately suck the stock hid bulbs that came on my car don't have a single problem like this, and these bulbs rattled when I got them and seemed s***ty to begin with.
B006WPQMWM|5|this is the second one I have had, non better!
B007M9HZO6|5|Nicely done, glorious picture.
B003L358WI|5|Works the money!!
B004ZF4JPS|4|I've been running the Kensun Slim Digital HID kit for my low beams in my Subaru Legacy for a couple of years now. When I blew a high beam I decided that I might as well upgrade those as well. The hardest part about install of these kits on a small vehicle is mounting the ballasts. Everything else is simple. My only complaint is that the case was open and parts jumbled in the box, including one of the bulb protectors being broken. Everything functions as it should though. These kits are a great deal !
B0077GPGZE|4|Is good for Me :)
B00A95Q780|5|Perfect present. Quick delivery.
B000XECJES|5|these are slightly on the thin side, compared to all the different brands i have tried. but not then enough for me to hold it against them.<br /><br />just rip off the little annoying tag and you are good to go. i use these to clean the kitchen and bathrooms, wax my car, dry my rims, and i always keep 1-2 in my car in case of spills.<br /><br />if you drop liquid on a carpet just grab a couple of these, mcrofiber is super absorbent, i place this on the spill and stand on it for a minute, it will soak it right out.
B00HB2M7HO|2|does not fit well on face.
B005FL1GTI|5|Cowboy Dan,this brake kit for my 97 jeep Grand CherokeeTSI. Fast shipping installed them all the way around for 250.00 bucks thats pads & rotors .brake them in just like they tell you to and no prob,they work great.PS,I was told it would cost 1.000$ to have this work done? Time for new tires 265/75 16s 3&#34; lift by suprem suspention all done in the driveway.
B00042KG3A|5|GREAT
B006O85CP0|5|Very fast delivery and great prices
B0000AXNMO|5|I applied this to my new shower doors.  I no longer have to worry about hard water deposits building up on the glass.
B00T0RBOOK|5|I ordered 2 sets of stickers from here an they were excellent I couldn't have asked for more. I would definitely order from here again.
B00ZQ0U6MQ|5|Keep up the good work..... Thank you
B00D75E7J0|5|Haven't had the time to install this yet, perhaps tomorrow, but first I must drench it in fabreeze to get that awesome smell.
B00KJGPN2K|5|Though the 1st unit I received would not charge, I worked with Sena to get it replaced as I had already installed all the other components in my helmet.  Sena customer service was 1st class; they had a new unit (and all associated components - so I have spare speakers, mic, etc.) to me within a week.  excellent sound quality for helmet speakers and PLENTY of volume.  Unit easily pairs with other comm units, phone, GPS, etc.  In addition, the price I got through Amazon was significantly lower than that of my usual motorcycle gear superstores.  I'm very satisfied.
B001FCAXZO|5|AWESOME
B00PQZPMYI|1|Didn't fit the Chevy Trailblazer, they said t would.  They are of an incredibly cheap and icky feeling fabric.  They do not secure at the top at all, but have to be squished under the headrest.
B006YDPLPQ|5|Great for the car to keep the seat belt locked in place with your little one's car seat!
B00042KG3A|5|Very nice jack, would buy again if needed.  Be very carfull using these things, I have the bruses to prove it.
B00CZDGW9I|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00JR33NI2|5|Easy to install!
B0041CDPQO|5|Works great
B004GCMVTG|2|The Amazon tool to match parts to my particular vehicle didn't work as advertised. I bought this bumper cover for my 97 Subaru Legacy GT sedan. When I took it to the body shop for installation and unpacked it, it turned out to be the bumper for the non-GT model Legacy. Totally useless for my needs. Getting a credit was quick and painless, but the vendor didn't want it back. I'm still looking for someone to take it, as it's perfectly good and I would prefer to keep it out of the landfill.
B001G6PX40|5|Thumbs up!!
B000AMXQDG|5|We think this is the best tire shine product on the market. It lasts a long time and makes the tires look great!
B000AMBOI0|5|good value for price
B000Z0HVHA|5|great product
B00EFFVWBC|5|Worked great.  Quality was A+
B0085KGOIE|3|Good solid construction and the rubber wheels are much quieter than those with plastic wheels when hauling the Tote to the dump station. Unfortunately, the unit height is too tall for travel trailer in that the 3&#34; connection in the top of the Tote is only about 2&#34; below the bottom of the 3&#34; connection to our travel trailer which does not allow for a connection between trailer and Tote that will drain properly. I purchased and installed a second 3&#34; cap with 3/4&#34; nozzle connection and put it on my travel trailer hooked adapter and connected the 3/4&#34; hose to it and shoved the other end of the 3/4&#34; hose into the Tote in order to drain it - thus no seal. Had I compared the height of our travel trailer piping dimensions with the Tote-N-Store unit I would have realized I needed a less tall Tote. This unit needs a second tapered hooked adapter, like the one used to attach the flex hose to Tote in order to connect the other end of flex hose to the hooked connector of the trailer pipe. In order to improve dumping the Tote, I'm looking for a 3&#34; tapered fitting to band clamp the flex hose end opposite the connection to the Tote that will allow me to insert the flex hose into the<br />dump station hole. Actually, a non-hooked adapter elbow with tapered end would work best.  Live and learn.
B0007UQ2N2|5|Great hose
B00XXLZ29M|5|Boutique quality towels with excellent price point.  Extremely soft and safe to use on autos with delicate clear coat.  I have an older version that had gone through numerous wash cycles, yet remained plush.  Good to see quality hasn't gone down.
B004YWPELA|5|Kensun has great quality products. Very clean and bright HID's. Highly recommended. Very happy with purchase.
B00JMHGUZ6|4|:( love the product but it will not fit in my RV door. Going to have to return.
B00CE2Q4LQ|5|A little bigger than expected but that was my fault.  High quality product.  Provided as scheduled.
B000HAYHH0|5|Came fast, sturdy, works well in my box
B0091FJYES|5|Fit perfect
B00JVHLS3G|5|looks 5 time it price
B007Y867DA|5|Priced right made in America?
B005ZWN5FU|5|Just as advertised. And super sturdy! Love them
B00BCRMAAS|2|Well I guess you get what you pay for. Very poor quality control in their making of the seat covers, I will never buy them again.
B001DC9ZCS|5|As expected
B00A7EMCMS|2|Takes a VERY strong hand to use. Not at all an efficient design.
B00VF6B8X6|5|Excellent product! I recommend that everyone get one
B0017KJ15C|5|banks has spent years researching air flow and efficiency regarding common rail cummins engines.  Kit was easy to install, engineered for ease of installation - excellent.  More expensive than other products, however I am more than pleased.  Picked up .5 mpg, reduced tail pipe smoke with my Smarty Jr.
B00F0CIR3A|1|I just received my mirror maybe 10 minutes ago and a soon as I opened it , I noticed it was chipped in a few different place..
B00HVHAF9Q|5|Love PINK...
B00EPQUH3A|5|Fits my 128&#34; 3 seater 2002 Seadoo pretty nice.  I'm not using it for towing, so for the price this thing is fantastic.  I sure it will billow a bit in the wind, tho.  The straps are weird to adjust, but at least it has them for windy conditions.
B00D8U0A86|5|love this for obvious reasons. sticker is a little smaller than i expected, but close enough. maybe the USA can pull out of this Obamanation.
B000C3PYT2|5|Fit perfect on my car! Really easy to put
B006EFN1FG|5|Junkyards and other websites were charging $60-180 to get this, and I thought I was screwed (serp belt frayed, grabbed this part and shoved it down onto the pully, wearing a hole in the rubber on this). Managed to get the AC working in my own; getting this part was great. Exact match as well.
B000EVWDAK|5|DOES THE JOB
B00QMWQSAG|5|Great color and heavy duty
B00DIGMTHA|5|These mats were perfect! They were reasonably priced and delivered in a timely manner. I would definitely order from this seller again!
B00ARYTBFY|5|I put these on the lower bezel of my 2015 Taurus and they are awesome
B0078EDCB0|1|Thought this product was terrible. It was like bright yellow Easter Egg dye. It routine the small section I tried on tan leather car interior. Scrubbed most of the yellow out, but it still left a stain. Very disappointing!
B00F8LEB9W|5|Worked just as advertised, extremely easy to pair I had it done in less than two minutes
B00496LM4E|5|Fit like a glove.
B000IDUW5C|5|good price for safety
B004XN4UY2|5|I actually got this as a cover for my 30 Amp plug.  It has a hole in the top which I couldn't see in any of the pictures but that was OK.  Because I just put a nut and bolt through the hole and sealed it and put a keeper on that to keep it to my cable.  When I'm underway I cap my connector with this and it keeps the water out.
B0016WGUFU|4|It's a bit loud and clunky when engaging but works as advertised.
B00L5GIRA8|1|I received a different key than the one I needed (not wanted). Now I'm screwed with a useless key and I still need to replace the original.
B00L7XDGL4|5|They came on time sooner than expected! Great packaging perfect condition! I had them installed and adjusted by a shop! Put white led switch backs in the marker lights looks sick! Headlights are brighter than stock! One led when first installed had to warm up almost thought it was broken! Over all I love these headlights!
B00RUCN80K|5|Installed in my car....this was a very high quality looking piece.  I installed it with the Jensen VX 7020 double din radio and the car looks fantastic.  Replaced factory gray console.  Good buy.
B001QV881K|5|fit perfect for my application / appears little more heavy duty compared to other products.
B00151AFPI|5|Replaced my serpentine belt today on a 2008 Tundra 5.7L V8. It took me about an hour or a little more. Was pretty straight forward and not near as expensive as the local Toyota dealership wanted ($250). I did have to buy a longer breaker bar and some adapters to align the belt tensioner with the hole that keeps it from tensioning the belt. My sockets were 3/8 inch and the breaker bar I bought was 1/2 inch. It would have been somewhat easier access wise if I had gotten a 1/2 inch 14MM socket rather than using the adapter to my 38 inch 14MM socket. I would recommend taking the belt out of its packaging before hand and hanging it up to straighten it out somewhat. The curves from how it is packaged takes somewhat of a set and slows down the process of installing the new belt. I had to go in a few times to check the routing of the belt on my computer (and sip on a beer) so that contributed to the longer install. I didn't remove the V-Block cover from the engine for the actual belt install, but had removed it a couple of days earlier to wash it off. It comes off and on pretty easily, so kind of up to you, I didn't think it would have given me much better access from the top with or without it. There are a couple of good links I'm including to help you out, one from You tube and the other a pdf.  Tundra 3UR-FE Belt.pdf from tundra solutions website and the following You tube link that's for a 2007 Tundra but as I understand it the 2007-11 model years are the same https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52MAer_7-QA
B00VK0ATNC|5|Good light wish they came with mounting hardware
B00MZKBN3Q|5|The rotors and pads fit great. I purchased them for my 2006 Dodge Magnum SXT.<br />Quick shipping, great price, and even better service from the supplier.<br /><br />If you're looking for a higher quality rotor and brake pad set.....this is the one to buy.
B000W0RQ8C|1|Lock cap stopped working after 2 months of use (est. 10 times on and off).
B00T5Q98H6|5|Really nice cab lights look good on my 1998 ford f150
B006QH54VQ|5|Now i never have a dead battery and my car stereo can blast loud for hours
B0062IJYUG|2|Cool looking, but what they left out is that it is suppose to just go over your existing fuel door. Ohhh and did I mention it doesn't even come with any 3M tape on it or in the packaging.
B003YO7OSA|5|Excellent original product. Quickly reception.
B00PY1U8TI|4|They look very good!
B000BUQODG|5|I love this I put these on the roof of my camp so now i can leave the vents open on  the camper all the time and it won't rain in.
B000MD4YKM|4|Good quality, heavy duty.
B00W31VMYC|5|works as it should and with both of my older cars too
B00D9C2CDO|4|Fit nicely on your Toyota Highlander. Was surprisingly quite and easy to load. Takes up as much space as a couple of beach towels when not in use.<br /><br />Only draw back is that you have to disconnect the straps to get to anything inside, where a hard top cargo carier may be more easily accessible.<br /><br />Update:  I love this thing!  We tossed it in the trunk for our Christmas trip and loaded it up with the kids presents from the family on the way back.  Don't know what we would do without it.
B000BHHW94|5|GREAT PRODUCT AT THE RIGHT PRICE.
B00L2M73TQ|1|The gaskets are no good they leak 1 week after I had it installed had to pay the shop again to get it do
B0009H51RG|5|10/10. Would filter air with again.
B00S043ELK|5|Great prouduct.
B00KQSMJJ6|5|Just like original!!
B001BK6CA0|5|Folks, the driver side mirror replacement fit like a glove for my father in law's 2000 Ranger. Priced right, quick delivery. My thanks.
B00D7T4LX8|5|favorite! keep it on me everyday. I feel much safer at college
B00LG0YSYC|3|It's ok i think but not work with my car...
B003RB0YB4|2|The product failed on the second use and was returned.
B00S8C2CHQ|5|there a homerun
B0052R5PPQ|5|Awesome
B00S0I5V30|5|worked well on a 2012 brute force. Fixed my hasatation problem
B001XCBCQK|4|ok
B0023VDAYC|5|Great replacement part. Fit great.
B000RI9GF0|5|big help
B007EZOIMU|5|For all the bad reviews of this product, it is absolutely obvious that the biggest problem with it is that those who hate it don't know how to order the right product for their vehicle or don't have the thoughtfulness or initiative to properly assemble it and make it work. I have one of these for my 2006 Toyota Camry and it works perfectly and hangs on tightly and well without ever scratching the paint. Yes, it would not have worked so well if I had mounted it with no thought or modifications but I simply added a bit of Tressostar bicycle handlebar tape to the hook of the mounting clamps to keep them from scratching the car's paint and then bent the clamps, by hand, to properly grab the roof at the right angle which was super easy to do.The racks are now very easy to mount quickly and solidly and they never give me the least amount of trouble.  I WILL agree that it would have been more thoughtful and advantageous if the manufacturer had included assembly instructions and would have added to the acceptance of their product, but I had no real problem in figuring it out with a little thoughtfulness.  Makes one wonder why so many people don't realize why we were born with brains.
B007DBE5K0|4|lighting, color and brightness are great..<br />you do need more than 17 pieces for the entire interior lighting tho<br />also the lights for the backseat towards your head will flicker sometimes and are a bit big for the housing, had to put the housing back in crookedly to fit the bulb and keep the light from losing contact with the housing and shutting off<br />for the price this a good kit
B00PJ3ACOW|5|Perfect! Easy to apply
B00B8T1150|5|Too cute for words, exactly what I wanted
B00ABYVT64|5|great value and product - made so you can place handle and tube in bigger bottle if needed - i like that. i have some bottles that the sprayers have broken.
B008B3A382|1|Very misleading. I thought I had ordered (6) of the 12 x 50 and ended up with 1 large sheet. Not cool
B007AONLZK|5|The product fits exactly. I have absolutely no issues during installation and the power lift works perfectly with the new struts.  My only advice for installing lift supports is have a long stick handy to prop up the lift gate while the old one is removed.
B000WOCG7E|5|Nicely made. Not your average cheap grips. I would defiantly recommend these.
B011JNP9Z2|5|excellent for the price
B00F4YHODS|1|I agree with all of the comments from reviews.  The strap was not sewn .  No way will it stay put like the pic shows.  Very small and not easy to place anything on it.  Did not get a pen.  The seller will not pay to return I guess they don't want useless stuff around either!
B001UOCSG4|5|This stuff is amazing!  Goes on easy, looks great!  The slickness of the treated surface is unbelievable, I did part of a test panel with, Blackfire AIO, CG Jetseal and the Ultima,  the ultima is by far the easiest to apply.  Time will tell for longevity, I think the Jetseal will win that battle, but for the effort, Ultima has my vote!  Works amazing on glass too.
B002KQ86EY|5|Holds the chains on and adds just enough tension to them so that they don't slip.
B00DCVZ3JM|5|I did not expect the item to be shipped so fast. Great service and quality. Just finished installation, everything fits perfectly. Thank you for a good service.
B0015KR14C|3|This was leaking when it arrived but at least it was packed in plastic so it did not get on other items in my order or soak through the box, but the bottle was on the light side.  Works okay.
B0091FJYES|5|Perfect fit!
B000R9T21M|5|Perfect fit, superb design, high quality, and fast shipment (arrived like 4 days earlier than projected)!
B00VJ4LHUS|5|I actually was looking for an organizer for my laundry area. I needed something I could put  used  lint, and dryer sheets in. I needed it on the wall. I saw you're car organizer and it solved everything.  I can even get plastic bags in the pockets! Saves space and looks much cleaner!!!
B005GK9JXS|3|Adhesive strip failed within 3 days of application. Stuck firmly to the glass, but came off the plastic window support. Not sure how I will hold it up in the window now.
B004XONNQW|5|Very pleased works well. Nice gauge.
B00KTIUG5C|5|Works for my 2003 F150 extended cab.
B00ANXSWQS|3|A bit darker shade than expected...otherwise sticks fine.
B004Q0CLBQ|5|Thanks
B006PMJANK|4|6' 5&#34;<br />200 lbs<br />Slender but not skinny with long basketball player arms.<br />Purchased Med-Tall<br />I like my clothes to fit fairly snug. This is a good looking jacket that fits very well. The sleeves end a little past my wrists so I really like the length. The armor is sits in place quite well and doesn't shift around. The below pads in my Joe Rocket Phoenix jacket shift around quite a bit, just for the sake of comparison. All the adjustments are there between waist, forearms, and upper arms to get a good fit. The leather is tough, heavy, yet comfortable. I have no doubt that if I ever went down, I would be very well protected.<br /><br />Warmth; I'm not a fan of temperatures below 55 F. This jacket keeps me warm on it's own down to 55 F, can probably go down to 50 F. I can fit a puffy, down vest underneath this if necessary with no issues (think Northface, not a super puffy one).<br /><br />The shoulder armor is fairly wide. My shoulders resemble those of an NBA basketball player named Dwight Howard when I'm wearing the jacket. Google him, look at his shoulders, and you'll get it.<br /><br />I removed 1 star for 3 reasons:<br />1. Perhaps they'll change the picture in the future and this comment will no longer be valid. As it stands now, the picture on Amazon is of a shiny black jacket that appears to be a softer leather. I really like the look of the jacket in the picture. This jacket is less stylish; more of a matte black industrial look. Like I said; it looks good, just not like the picture. The style is pretty much the same.<br />2. This is probably my own problem; I have a hard time getting my backpack on over this jacket. I tend to flail and wiggle until I finally get the straps over my wrists. Once the straps are over my wrists the rest is no issue. This can be a bit embarrassing when you're on the streets of downtown San Francisco during peak hours.<br />3. The zipper isn't high quality. It's not bad, just not super smooth. My Joe Rocket Phoenix jacket zips much smoother.<br /><br />Overall I like the jacket and I'm keeping it. I just wish it was shiny and soft looking like the picture.nix jacket zips much smoother.<br /><br />Overall I like the jacket and I'm keeping it. I just wish it was shiny and soft looking like the picture.
B00CDAFT6K|2|It works have been great if it lasted longer then 2 months. The suction cup keeps falling off the window and the ring where the suction cup fits came off the mesh. Good idea, but product needs to be better constructed.
B000EQESVC|5|Perfect fit for my 2009 Kia Spectra EX!
B00DBEP77I|4|not the brightest bulb but well worth the money. you have to install your own resistor so it doesnt blink fast. would look great with a clear lens
B008XNZZ7O|4|I'm a realtor representing a home of a smoker for fifteen years.  Opened all the windows.  Put a jar upstairs and one downstairs.  A week later it started showing and haven't heard a word about the smell of cigarettes.
B00FSDEH1C|5|The power sliding door on our 2005 Sienna had begun to fail to close and open. We had to help push it open or pull it closed. After examining the cables and pulleys and not seeing any signs of rusting or fraying, we noticed that the door sagged considerably and in fact was making contact with the side of the van upon closing.<br /><br />After replacement, the door opens and closes perfectly and no longer needs assistance.<br /><br />Product was genuine Toyota part and fit perfectly.
B006MHSKC0|5|I bought as a replacement for a blown pump. It worked and functioned great
B00MKBCMYY|5|works good
B00IN3CWLG|5|great, received quickly
B0022ZT69C|5|Came with all the wires, fuses, and tube needed for my bike.  Only thing it needed was to find acid to put in it.
B001LA18W2|5|Great little sticker! I get a lot of compliments on it
B00JIJ4LWW|4|I left my accent leather chairs outside for over a week and half and saw it hardening due to morning wet dew and summer heat. Bought this and applied liberally once at night for 2 days to let conditioner settle. It now feels great. The only drawback was smell although it disappears after a day when applied. That being said, this saved my leather accent chairs and Definitely worth the investment!!
B00EWSE5HA|5|Did the job as expected. OEM items, delivered quick, no issues.
B00466L2GU|3|Needed to spend more time in quality control. The bubble was not level. The three holes that hold it were so out of center. Screws that adjusted the level were soft aluminum.They broke. Lucky I am handy with a tap/die set. Now that the repairs are made to parts that should have been rejected, I think it will do the job. If you can find one cheaper take it. Not quite worth the 60.00 bucks I paid. Definetly generic.
B00OY6JDH2|3|Used it to extend the seatbelt for my little girl's booster seat. it's a bit too long for that purpose and pokes her in the side of her tummy.
B000DZLE0C|3|It was folded and so it has wrinkles in it on outside. If they had folded it the other way wrinkles would be on inside and not seen
B005C5ET0U|5|I have used Prima Hydro for over a year and I think it is great. There are a couple of other decent wax as you dry products on the market and I have used each one of the others. They are better than nothing, but Prima Hydro is the best.
B000HAEPAO|5|I attached these to the wooden platform in my jon boat, so that I could keep my cooler from sliding around. They work very well. Seems like you could tie down a lot of weight with these. Well made
B001V8U12M|5|Best thing ever. Makes leveling our travel trailer a piece of cake.
B0001EFSTI|2|I wanted to like it much more, but it has major drawbacks. I bought this as a small, easy to carry, utilitarian tool. But one of the main aspects I wanted it for - the bottle opener - is practically unusable. It in fact is so frustrating to use that I gave up after the third try. Simply was not point to it. The knife and screwdriver (small as it is) are fine. Oh, and if you want to use the bottle opener, or some other aspects, BE AWARE that it will separate at the top, and fall off the keychain. There is no way to use it while attached. Big detriment.
B00EC0Z1GC|5|2011 Honda CR-V SE<br /><br />It's a flat mirror with a similar focal point to the OEM mirror; it clips securely to mirror shell and fits perfectly. Wonderful!!
B007LIB6AW|1|meh, doesn't really fit on my steering wheel.  it slides and that's annoying when driving.  wish I could return it.
B00ALI332I|5|Great quality
B00RM327NG|5|Best phone car accessory
B00GI81T0I|5|Nice and durable. Fits in most SUVs (I am not sure about cars). Looks great and does not even smell like rubber so no need for a air freshener.
B001JT5MCC|4|Awesome product, good quality sound makes it a lot easier to hear my scanner instead of the speaker being on the floor it is above me.
B0007M1FM8|4|pretty good but it sticks out pretty far so I take it off to prevent people from knocking the crap out of their shins in the parking lots.
B005CCJ25K|4|Great product....+++++A
B000AMOENW|5|Great experience
B00B117TQA|5|Cut perfectly and its nice that it doesn't accordian fold.  Allows a snugger fit.  Silvered surface does a good job.
B00EHLUAXU|5|works great. lots of light.
B011GYSW4Y|2|Cheap quality.
B001TCC858|4|a little bit of a pain getting the bottom plate on, but once you do get these installed they look great.  Seem to seal up any open holes on the bed really well.
B00062ZCSC|1|I had to use RTV to attach this to the vacuum cannister as the double faced tape that it came with was completely dried out. It seems that every product I have ever bought from Spectre Performance had a problem. When I ordered this I wasn't paying close attention and did not realize it was from Spectre or I would not have bought it.
B001RBCU90|5|Ya, well, its a sticker and it stuck so I guess its cool.
B007SKAKPU|4|The code reader worked just fine. Plug on, following the instructions and you are fine... so far so good, however, I gave it four stars cuz the anchor for the cable is very loose I might have to pull it apart to secure it.
B0056AAK3Q|5|on time and as advertised.
B004I8Q2HK|1|they were great for about 1.5 years. then they leaked water. i had to take them off to drain out the water. then the reflective surface on the inside fell off, now i can hardly see at night. will never buy these again!
B0002M7D6U|1|Product is described as 5.9 x 1.8 x 7 inches.  This is false. These values are actually only even kind-of close to the PACKAGE dimensions. The actual product itself is a measly 3.75 x 2.4 inches. Returning.
B00LTXPKEI|3|Fits my 2003 Sequoia OK -- not a tight/solid as I'd hoped, but seem good enough.  The plastic hooks for attaching it are a disappointment -- I fear they will break some day.  The instructions clearly say to install them with the flat round part of the hook on the inside of the mirror, but that is WRONG -- they fit, but poorly.  I saw an online video where someone put the flat round part on the outside, and they fit much better that way -- there is a lot less bending strain on the plastic hooks and they seem less likely to break.<br /><br />I wish the mirrors were bigger, and that the passenger side was slightly convex -- the driver side mirror is OK, but the passenger side one isn't as useful when towing.  But I can now back my trailer into my side yard without someone spotting for me, which I couldn't do before.
B00068XCQU|5|good
B00AZMI9EM|1|Purchased June 14th, 2015. Died August 26th, 2015 (2 months, 12 days later). And now my catalytic converter is also toast. No more than 3,000 miles on the car. This is unacceptable. I actually bought this to preemptively replace the OEM coil pack. When this burnt out, I reinstalled the OEM coil pack - car is up and running again, but the cat is, again, toast.
B0053ZB1Q4|1|It started to peel off in a 86* weather
B00U2ADLW2|5|Works perfect for resetting my engine light on occasion.
B00CPR5UF6|5|cheap, accurate, worth for the money.<br />but the battery used is unusual size which is rare in availability and very expensive.<br />Instead of changing battery it is cheap to buy one new gauge.<br />manufacturer must seriously consider either using commonly available AAA size or 2032 size
B002UC19T2|2|Please see my rating for the Hydro Life 52141 HL-200 External Filter Kit, in which I wrote about this filter failing after only six uses. I'd expect better quality for a filter that costs as much as this one does.
B001JT98S6|5|I use this to power my cb radio, a bearcat 880. I didn't want to forget to turn it off after turning my truck off and kill the battery. So this was a great alternative instead of direct battery hook up. I feel the cord is too short as I'd hoped to run it from the DC plug in up under the dash to one side and then on top of the dash to the rear of the cb. It's too short to do that. But it is not in the way just going straight up to the cb radio from the cigarette lighter anyway. It lights up too at the cigarette end, a cool blue, wasn't expecting that, but makes no difference, probably an indicator that it is powered.
B00QZHQFVA|5|These saddlebags look and fit my bike beautifully... Very pleased..
B005N6Z3V2|3|This shirt was excellent quality but runs way to small. Ordered a 3X instead of his usual size of 2X expecting it to run a little small. Couldn't even get this shirt around his chest or hips. Was going to send it back but ended up that my son loved it and he wears a size large and it fit hi,. so will be keeping the shirt. Sizing is completely off on this brand.
B00JDPRYLQ|3|The lower bushing doesn't fit for my Honda Shadow 1986. I kept the originals one not so worn. I only use the &#34;moving&#34; one, the clip and a o-ring.
B005CGRGG8|1|This was in pieces when I opened the package.  Solders were broken around the entire top and bottom of the light.  It was in such bad shape I put it back in the package and returned it.
B00JAXXD2U|5|Fit in my 2008 Harley Davidson Road King perfectly.  This thing turns the motor over strong and quick.  Oh yeah, and it's made in the USA.  Anytime I need to buy a product, if the quality is good, the price not unreasonable, and it puts Americans to work, then it's an easy purchase decision for me.
B000BWCFLO|5|Good quality and quick shipping
B00REJX5BQ|4|The bed cover definitely keeps the rain out and secures the bed as the tailgate has to be open in order to fold the bed cover back, but my tailgate also locks.  I would like the bed cover to be a little longer to extend over another inch of the tailgate.  The front clamps could also be re-engineered to be more like the front clamps.  The included LED light works great at night.
B004AQSBEC|5|Husband said it was just what he needed.
B00DHB092I|5|Good quality. Fast shipping
B00BT7TSFG|1|Will not work for my 2003 Chevrolet Avalanche.
B00OC0C0B6|5|Well made( solid and not flimsy ) and fits my 2015 Acura TLX perfectly.
B005UQQADU|5|looks good. worth it
B00KTIUG5C|2|ahhh.........not exactly what i expected. Maybe the batteries were dead or something....old stock or something..........works most days........does not work some days.
B00407WNE0|4|Lack of any installation instructions can lead to issues with removal of original and installation of this part. BUT, once in place, it is what you would expect in fit and finish from the factory.
B007ZDO8IU|5|Great product holds boost well and works like blox quality does:)Best price on the Web and shipping was pretty quick too.
B000C08Q8Q|1|Not use yet. Kit not complete as picture.
B00YDDPH26|5|Recommended! Easy!
B001O0U05K|5|good product
B001GRSV16|5|Great Product.... Super fast shipping!
B000KL2XRC|4|It is litterally that simple. Buy some connectors, (a pair of pliers works just as well as a professional &#34;crimping tool&#34;) and this thing is easy. The nice thing is you can wire this piece to your aftermarket radio plug anywhere (say for instance, in a desk and comfortable) and then you don't have to do it while sitting in your car. Simply plug in both ends when done and presto! Stereo works fine. I used it with a sony deck that had a usb port on it and would charge in addition to read and play off of a phone. My iphone 6 plays music and charges with this wire harness hooked up.
B006H81NLO|4|good affordable upgrade however the brake extension was not safe in my opinion so I made a complete new longer rod
B0031I5Z80|5|OEM - solid reliable performance!  These have lasted well and meet my high expectations for an OEM part.
B009YEYLFI|5|Excellent.  I have 1&#34; bars and the fit is excellent.
B000NPS086|5|Love the ability to vent in summer and in rain. Reduced that pressure wave herd with windows down on highway.<br />Fit perfectly and are low profile
B00J3E6PNK|5|Incredible product , perfect fit !
B007MVI5QQ|5|Did what it's supposed to
B001TXDPXQ|4|Was very pleased with this item.
B006GJKG1W|5|Awesome worked perfectly and makes the rear sit up nice for me happy with the product
B0001EW4DG|5|These were purchased for my daughters highlander replacing two that were broken.  A tough job to get the old off but we did the back windows first and ran out of time.  Next time she is home, we will spend an hour or so getting the old ones off and then it will take every bit of 8 minutes to put on the 2 front shades.  Thanks.
B00IO12YZQ|3|These would not fit into my Jeep 2011 Grand Cherokee Daytime Driving Lights but they worked fine for my reverse lights.
B00KTHYCEO|5|Worked perfectly!  The instructions to follow made my neighbors think I was a bit weird with all the door opening, closing, locking, etc.  :)
B000NZSNVU|5|Looks good love it only thing is that don't like the red bulbs it comes with but I just put led reds in it so all in all good product
B00YBEIP2G|5|Plug and play with my Spyder headlights, so far has outlasted the original ballast and is smaller so there are more mounting options...wish it came with an adhesive mounting pad but not enough to dock a star
B002S9UYM0|1|I've purchased THREE of these now, & all of them broke. The quality is terrible. The little plastic tabs are very thin & break easily. After the first two broke, I still gave it a chance & purchased again, hoping that maybe it was a fluke. What a waste of money.<br /><br />More importantly, your safety is what really matters. Don't risk your life on flimsy plastic.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS!
B00J8W5Z9C|4|Pretty freakin sweet. I do have some reception loss.
B001TMGC7I|5|It fits and seems to be OEM or better. Not sure what else to say about a cupholder... It holds a cup.
B00THH9I7I|5|Accurate gauge. Great price in the two pack. Gave one to my brother-in-law. He thinks it's great.
B0089K9NH4|5|Very good .quick ship fit perfectly !!!
B0002UQATS|5|excellent productj
B002OUQI3W|4|Works better on my 50 amp plug than it did on my 30 amp plug
B00K1C1WC2|5|good product
B009995MTC|5|My boss didn't think this was as funny as I did...... But it lasted 3 weeks on his porcsh so A++++ in my book!<br />Anyone highering?
B000CC0IRQ|5|It's a cool hula girl, but after a hot day on the dashboard her skirt can fly off.  It's applied with hot glue gun.  I reattached with super glue.
B00DNU3OAM|4|Loved them - mostly.  Heavy duty, well plated, multi-purpose attachment locations.  It solved a complicated fitment problem for me.! But I did have to turn the top plate upside down in order to get enough pinch on standard cables however.
B008BMN8X0|5|Very clean, bright white
B00JQOPV32|5|Good product.  Easy installation.
B000BYGGM6|5|very good
B000WK9BW6|1|These are pretty useless. They need to be in the angle to be of any use. Basically they reflect exactly what you see on your current mirror.  No blind spot help.
B00BXPSGHA|5|Looks nice!  I gave it as a gift and the recipient was very pleased.  Only negative is that it is a little heavier than expected, but seems to be made well.
B002R4V0WE|5|there great..gives the car a different look
B00634KUVG|4|Pretty good product.
B000BUU5WW|5|Neat NEAT NEAT!!!  keeps the sewer hose clean on the outside, and helps deliver the contents to the sewer trap.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Arrived on time and as described. It was easy to install and worked immediately.
B004AIHKT2|5|Worked great
B001DH0QUI|5|FIT THE MB 2006 E500 GREAT
B00IJ6INAG|5|FIT PERFECT TO MY JETTA SPORT 2013
B0027AL3X4|5|Worked perfectly
B005ALNCC2|5|for fans of SG1 this is perfect.
B00NP60URE|2|Very cheaply made and the pieces don't hold up.  The rubber gasket between the cylinder and the cap doesn't fit correctly and prevents a consistent air-tight seal making the system useless.  I'm keeping it around to test for vacuum leaks and other tasks, but it's almost not worth the space it takes up.
B00NTR458Y|5|I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a quality, durable and easy to use product. They have been tested in our mall security vehicles at night and with the sirens they move traffic. Good!
B009FNX6SQ|4|Very nice step bars, seem to be quality and look great.  Only complaint is one the bolts snapped off and broke inside bar when tightened by hand.  Had to weld it to the frame instead.  Hard to believe the quality of these bolts would break with hand torque only.  Other than that I am pleased.
B006QLN9F0|5|Installed easy. Fits just like the original does.<br />Make sure you save your original nuts. Its probably not needed but nice to have the emblem extra secure.<br />TIP: Removable of the old emblem. Just snap off the platic rods on the back with nettle nose pliers.
B00EFBYSLM|1|it's too flimsy, i hate it
B00EUZZK5G|2|Not happy with the fit and design. Returned.
B00N07IVVA|4|The item itself is very well made and looks great. They lost a star for their packaging. It came in a very damaged flat rate envelope which is by no means designed to hold that kind of item. BUT as for the item itself it is what I wanted and what I expected.
B001MU3DAQ|5|Works well!
B000EQ9ZVK|5|GREAT PIECE WILL DO BUSINESS AGAIN
B007SAIFWA|5|COOL!
B00DZ34YP6|4|still running strong
B00TDDCGN4|5|worked well
B00M1HUIDY|5|Unique design, my husband likes it in his truck.
B00EA0ZB7I|1|Got them out of the box and one didn't work definitely upset
B00BG3GFEU|5|Worked like a charm!
B005K5XVGU|5|Great quality and added a small bit of flare to the OEM turn signals.
B00O8EG35U|5|very bright but I have no idea how long will last, my reverse lights from CuteQueen with a different type of LED are superbright as well and still do fine in short use cycles
B007V2D2O6|4|It's well made and easy enough to put up, but one would think that a &#34;custom fit&#34; would fit a little better. It's a little over an inch shy of complete coverage.
B000AL8VD2|5|Better price than the small packet you buy at an auto parts store.
B00180I65M|5|This brake pad is very quiet. I highly recommend it.
B0007LQJLQ|5|Good fit looks good and installed fast.
B008G3IKPA|5|What I wanted
B00ROMINWY|4|Love this bitch cover but after having it for a little while now the picture is starting to get a green tint to it. Would have been nice if it didn't start getting green
B00BJCAPEE|5|This stuff is amazing.  Spray it on, let it sit and work off that grime and dirt in no time.  Smells great too!
B000NDL8PK|5|Perfect fit
B008FCD958|5|This product is easy to install and works exactly as you would expect.<br />Once the hooks are installed, loops on the ends of the net can easily be slipped on and off.  When I have small items (i.e. grocery bags, gym clothes) it is easy to slip the net onto the hooks and secure them for easy access.  When I have larger items (i.e. golf bags, camping gear), the net easily comes of and moves out of the way.  I hesitated a few months before I bought this, but am glad I pulled the trigger.
B000PWTIUG|5|Hey, it works! What more can I want? I'm no longer burning rich!
B00V5QDIPW|2|These guards are .5&#34; shorter than the DJI guards.  This means the blades actually extend beyond the guard!  One reason these seem like such a great idea is so you can easily remove them to fit the P3 into the case.  The mounting brackets that stay attached to the P3 extend so much that you must cut out the foam in your case to allow them to fit.  I had hopes of these being 'the ticket.&#34;  Sadly, I returned them.
B004QN2TII|5|Excellent, Now my hot water heater works without cutting out, Thanks for the quick shipping.
B003XNGLJU|5|Believe it or not, I was coming up on some deer on the road ahead of me and they looked at the car and took off the opposite direction. These things really do work..
B000CRO4IK|5|awesome product. Deep channels and has 4 slots as opposed to the ones made by Bell that only have 3 and a inner cup.. Very well made.
B0056HDCUM|5|works great, used it over a year still at 0 ppm.  very small signs of water spots.
B0022ZCTZU|5|works well on my harley, does not hurt any of the finishes.
B000CLHCEE|5|Quiet smooth braking, everything needed for a good installation.
B000C2LXHA|5|I put the brake pads on myself and it was easy and the product quality was amazing. There was no break-in period so I hit the road runing. I installed these on a 2004 Audi A4 1.8T (four door).
B0038B4AQI|5|Perfect headlights for turning signal. Perfect fit for my 1996 Honda accord.
B00FJT0304|5|This is one of the better quality suction guns, the parts fit together well.  The clear hose is thick wall, maybe 3/4 inch OD, which makes it too large for some oil fill holes.  Most suction guns have a thin wall hose that is the same ID, but only 1/2&#34; or so OD.  The ID of this hose and the nipple on the gun is no larger than any of the other common ones.
B000BM8RT8|5|Great air compressor,works like a charm
B001A2T6ES|5|great buy
B009KM1IZA|5|Sticking this on my car was a breeze, easy as pie. Looks really pretty, best value for the money.
B000BQWQ0A|5|Very quick and easy replacement for cracked, dry-rotted or damaged camper vent.
B00T74VX24|5|This thing is a MINI MIRACLE worker! My car had been having some battery issues. Sure, I should probably take it to the dealer and get a new one. It is under warranty. But in the meantime... I didn't want to get stranded in the middle of nowhere with a dead battery. I bought this months back, charged it, put it in its case, and practically forgot I had it in my glove box (yes, it fits with space for other treasures as well).<br /><br />Until... I was waiting for my boyfriend to come out of an appointment with my car OFF (no lights were on, I swear). And when I tried to start it... nada tostada. We were in a bit of a hurry and his face showed the edge of concern. But I opened my glove box, popped out the unit, and he looked at me bewildered and said, &#34;there is NO WAY that little thing is going to start this car&#34;.<br /><br />I too was pretty darn unsure. But what did we have to lose (other than I wasn't sure if my car was 12 volt and not sure if it might fry my car)?<br /><br />Well, my boyfriend hooked the sucker up and immediately told me to start. I actually thought for a moment, &#34;Shouldn't we let it charge?&#34; but followed his instruction.<br /><br />It started IMMEDIATELY.<br /><br />Later, he told me that the second he hooked it up it blinked green and he knew it was ready. And clearly it was.<br /><br />We both had a good laugh and were glad I had decided to buy this lovely little life saver.<br /><br />And, of course, it has the added benefits of charging other devices like your phone and computer. I have not tried this myself.... but based on its performance staring my car... I have little to worry about.
B0002SA3TS|5|So much more convenient than the zip down windows, I regret not buying these sooner.
B000C2SBYS|4|Gates products are always amazing and high quality but be aware that the flex hoses do not stay in any shape or bend. Flex hoses will bend if necessary but will go back straight once they are removed from a vehicle, like a spring. Unlike metal flex hoses these rubber ones will not maintain complex curves
B00PJUVBGS|5|Perfect for the price
B000IYD852|5|fit great, good quality replacement
B00F2VB1TQ|5|Worth every penny! Soft &amp; comfortable and stays put
B00VEW34LU|5|These are quality tools for window tinting. Comfortable in the hand. Worth the price of admission.
B00CNEFDM6|5|My mother hates it. Ha ha.
B00990FTOO|2|They look great but rusted onto my valve stems and had to be cut off and ended up replacing the TSP because the valves were damaged after just one winter
B000C9LOHW|5|oem parts, what else can i say
B004XERS2W|1|Logo and writing has worn off way too fast. Would not buy again and doubt I will see a replacement.
B0048IVY8C|5|I bought this to put in my 2007 350z , the lights a super bright I am very pleased with them .packaging was great . Installed them very easily . Great product
B004BE60ZU|5|Quality is good.  Works fine.
B006E2PKN0|4|Great light for my rv, creates no heat, and light output is good.
B00407TVNG|5|Great product, matches my oem paint perfectly, goes on nice, works as expected
B00L1S0JU6|5|Great product, exactly as described.  Very quick delivery!
B0073VENUC|5|This works great on 2014 Chevy Equinox.  Thanks
B000CN4XZI|5|As advertised.  Fast delivery.
B00JH1HI94|3|Very thin build. not much surface contact on rim to hold it on. I know others are using them and say they are holding up. I just didn't trust em and returned them.
B00I9IOWZE|3|Not what expected. Fits ok. Hard to get straps attached because of where they are and i guess the size of seats. But they  are ok.
B006J8UWMS|4|Great product....
B000GZR156|5|Awesome - fits my '05 VRSCA perfectly, and at a much better price than the OEM part but similar/same build quality. Nice to have the brake light turn off when I release the lever again!
B00GDIPNMS|5|always great
B0020K0DJG|5|Great Velcro pad for my porter cable buffer
B000CP8FNW|1|According to the Reese website, Amazon and several other sites (which I am sure get their information from Reese) this item should fit my 2007 Toyota Sequoia SR5.  IT DOES NOT!  When the receiver is in place to mount it, part of the arms near the ends touches part of the undercarriage of my vehicle.  This prevents the far ends from from being flush to the body where they need to be bolted.  There is nothing special or modified about my SUV.  It's a standard SR5.. This item just does not fit.  I called Reese customer service and the Reese guy had me verify my VIN to be sure I had the right year and such.. which it was.  He had no explanation other than saying something like 'we don't have any complaints about it not fitting that car'.  Well you do now!  He didn't take my information or let me know he was creating a complaint or note or however they track these things.  Next I looked online and found a Curt receiver that says it fits so I ordered that one (CURT 13440 Class III Receiver) and when I dry-fit it...  what do you know it fit perfectly!  I then put the Reese and Curt next to each other on the ground and sure enough you can see that they are not the same.. would not fit the same vehicle.  There is about a 3/4 inch difference in the heights between them from the top of the middle mount point and the top of the arms where they mount.  I added 3 pictures.   The first shows the Reese and Curt items side by side.  The Curt item has a cardboard sleeve on it so you can clearly tell which is which.   I shimmed up the Curt receiver so that the bumper mount plates are level between the two receivers.   The second picture attempts to show that they are vertically lined up at the center point.   Then the third picture shows that the Reese receiver arms are higher than the Curt receiver.   The Curt receiver fits and the Reese arms being too high causes them to but up against the undercarriage of the vehicle so the mount points on the arms do not sit flush to the mount points on the car.     Unfortunately, after I boxed this item back up I forgot about it in my garage and now I can't return it.  criagslist here I come I guess.  I'm not commenting on the quality of this product because I never got to use it.  I am also not complaining about the Amazon return policy because it was my own fault I waited too long.  My complaint is the inaccuracy of the Reese vehicle match information and the very weak customer service I received.  Recommend you order a CURT receiver.
B003BYFTEE|5|Fits perfectly in my 2008 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. Very happy with the features and the good fit. Only potential downside is that it has a lock but doesn't come with a key, but I wouldn't ever use it anyway.
B0007VEHFQ|5|It fit my car...  unlike the Reese hitch I tried.  Buy Curt.
B004QLZCES|5|Works great for light duty.
B008GVH8XW|5|Good parts. Keep in mind you need a bushing press to do it yourself. A mechanic (if you find one who accept) will ask you between 180 and 500 bucks to do it. So, be able to explain the work with a video, it helps a lot.
B0009JKI7W|5|Very good for removing water from a windsheild. Heck, I bought two....
B004L38AL8|4|We love it! Nice and tall!
B000SL4A84|5|Good product. Do exactly what I need. Thanks.
B00D3298A0|5|Very nice replacement mats. I am using them to protect the original carpet.  They are heavyweight but flexible.  They can be trimmed for an exact fit by cutting around the convenient patterns molded into the mats.  For my Ford Escape, they needed no trimming except the removal of the small strip where they were attached to the packaging.  For a larger vehicle they might be a somewhat small but for a small SUV like mine they are perfect.<br />They have deep grooves to catch dirt, water and snow.  Cleaning is a simple matter of hosing them down.  Shipping was prompt.  I would definitely recommend.
B003RY53U8|5|Perfect just what I was looking for thank you
B002IVEOR4|5|Amazing piece for less than $5. Replaces the easy-to-break plastic garbage that comes standard on most trailers.
B0041TR3BK|5|It worked perfectly
B00684TAYY|5|Works great
B00P9EJGR0|4|Great product, would recommend to anyone
B00407RRQE|3|Great color. Fast dry
B0024NSR4C|5|Dealer wanted $600, these are perfect
B0092ZWDNG|5|Great fit and works well in my 2015. It's just a bit difficult to roll up quickly because the velcro strap is kind of short. I might add a velcro strip to make it super easy to roll up quickly
B0002JN2EU|5|good service - good product
B009T4OC3Y|5|Easy install, worked great.
B002805T74|4|Rings fit my 2010 camaro ss nicely. They help reduce the shake at high speed
B000RN2AHQ|5|Got it right on time. Goes on my bike and is secure. Looks good and can store a lot in it. Very happy with this product.
B004757NQI|1|Don't go over 30 because you'll be hearing some crazy noise from these. I returned the product, it was very disappointing.
B00150T140|5|Perfect the real deal.<br />Thanks
B002R0YM14|5|Thanks
B004L5WLZ2|4|It's was ok,nothing special
B00925TWKS|4|Didn't get the sticker with it.
B00V7UO4DQ|4|It is what I'd expect for $17.00.  Does a fairly good job picking up dog hair, grass, and dirt in my car.
B00JAR6LXY|5|The best $249. I've ever spent
B004GCU3OG|5|Perfect fit
B000R4S4ZC|5|excellent... shafts are long enough, all parts shown are there. Very strong...<br />works well on my boat...I'm Happy :)
B007R4GMTU|5|Love it
B003BYFT9O|5|Worked great in a vintage truck.
B00D1YP8FE|5|Very nicely constructed, solid and attractive. The  light output is excellent and in a good temperature range. A great value!
B004UQQS8I|3|does the job
B0038B23M6|3|I ordered these light but received different ones, I was disappointed!<br /><br />Although with that being said, the one ended up working out much better and look great! Also the ones I odered did not have a trunk release key hole, and the one I got did! I am happy with my purchase but wish I new what I was getting before hand.<br /><br />Installation was a breeze. The original lights on my car (2003 eclipse gt) had three screws. And the new ones had four. I had to drill two extasy holes, one for each light into the frame. But worked out great, and installed both lights under 15 minutes!
B000JZFVBO|4|Looks good. Easy install (10 minutes). No shaking when driving. Horsepower and sound improvements are negligible. I hear a very subtle high pitched whine, but I probably could fix it by tightening the clamps.
B0018S1XRC|5|Has worked great so far for me.  I have ordered another set for the rear.
B00C6N1HBK|5|Perfect - saved us a great deal of money and works as described.
B00XQN432O|5|Cheap, work decently well.. when I first got it the ballast was not getting power but fixed it after powering it on and off a few times.. strange but after a few weeks, the problem has not came back. great buy!
B008S24LAM|5|Worked perfectly for my 2007 Honda Fit.
B00I50MDF2|1|Don't be fooled by the 5 packages of fuses on display.<br />5 pieces means 5 fuses.
B003O0YM0W|5|Installed on my 2005 C6 Corvette and they were very easy to install and perform great. Highly recommended.
B000CAYYP0|5|Grea
B00VNJ4PEO|5|Lil modification,works well
B002EOZFQ4|5|Very plesaed.
B00DIPSA8I|1|Terrible quality!! Put on my rear car window and it faded to a ugly green in 2 weeks!!
B00SXHLDP8|4|Lightweight and fast
B00C5T0JCI|5|Great item.  One less key to carry on my keychain now.  Only drawback is that I have to turn off the truck to lock or unlock the hitch
B00GOYN3Y6|5|Awesome product, great price, major upgrade over stock halogen lights. A++++
B00KYB5TEC|5|They work great everything fit perfect. Thanks well satisfied.
B001FAIAYC|1|Worst purchase ever.  I'm just glad Amazon let me return it.  If you buy this carpet set, be prepared to remove your ENTIRE interior, every bolt.  And you'll still need to cut it to fit properly.
B002ZTNVDM|5|great door handle. replaced my original handle in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ half doors. Look and function perfectly.
B009EFVCHW|3|The picture makes it look stitched but the ones I received looked like they were plastic. Floor mats look great because they are actual symbols. The steering wheel cover, seat covers, and strap covers look bad because it looks like some just laminated a label on it. Also they look white in the picture the ones I received are grey.
B00A2XLSD8|5|excellent!
B00D9C2CDO|5|Was weary about the rooftop carrier... not anymore. This delivered exactly what I needed. Much better than I expected, Zipper flaps are great and held down with Velcro. Excellent choice for the money.
B00OFLFWKI|5|Great product at a fair price
B0090Q4MZY|5|Great product with no issues
B00AE3J1GW|3|this product most be programmed every week, the question is why ? you can't reed anything on the menu over that.
B000CQBFRO|5|Proper flange for the car
B004P9DQLC|5|works great
B000BR6WBS|5|Put one on my 2002 F150 Harley Davidson, Great Filter. It does improve performance.
B000C2QPG4|2|Not satisfied
B0031B4YU2|4|Love it
B00INIRGNU|5|Thank you
B00BZVYM98|2|I purchased two remotes and after four months the first remote stopped working. The second remote only works if I am within 4 to 5 feet of the drivers door. Defeats the purpose of having remote start.
B0058KYUWQ|5|As described fast shipping
B00J3D75QM|4|I received everything as expected
B0083W16SM|3|it ok
B000J45BF6|5|This fits my 01 jetta perfect
B0055AW9KO|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00D7T4LX8|4|This product was a gift for my daughter. This was bought as a personal safety device for her to be able to carry on her person. It was just the right size and cute enough to not look scary. This device fits her hand nicely and is sturdy enough to poke holes in a very solid cardboard box. Hopefully she will never have to use this for her own personal safety but I feel it could do enough damage for someone to take pause while she runs away. A+ Seller
B0049ZFVMO|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.  Have not installed it yet as of this posting.
B000IPAK9S|5|works well
B000XRHRZQ|4|These fit great on my 2009 5D Hatchback Yaris. I gave 4/5 instead of 5/5 because after reinstalling them (air valve wasn't lined up with groove) I've notice they come loose after some steeper driveways/bumps. They don't seem to hold as well after first install.
B008HZOD2Q|5|Good grip at brake. Smooth and quiet. The only thing it leaves mud particles on the rims that needed to clean to allow the rim remains shinny.
B0052UOBEE|5|i was skeptical to be honest. Thought what the hell, Ill give it a try.<br /><br />I was amazed it absolutely worked first time I tried it. (following instructions of course)<br /><br />Thought for sure was wasting some money and would have to go to nissan for a proper one.<br /><br />Not so at all.<br /><br />Very pleased.
B000C96O8Q|5|Fits and have more power
B00KVU6YRW|5|We bought these in conjunction with LED replacement bulbs. These seem to be of better quality than OEM at a fraction of the price.
B008RO3DYQ|5|It fits, it works.
B001GMFITE|5|Great fit and good quality.  I would purchase again.
B000R5BLW4|5|Every now and then this tool is quite handy. Use it to keep tension downward when air-hammering a ball joint off. Or use it to manually pry down a control arm in order to move it for whatever reason -- to move the ball joint out of the knuckle or move the knuckle out of strut, for instance.  This is one of those tools that is in between specialty and must-have.
B009M0S4U2|5|I love this thing!!  I have a nice brand new car.  I also drive a fuel tanker for a living. On a daily basis I am covered in grease, diesel fuel, and gasoline for the commute home. This cover installs in seconds. Its made of a heavy duty canvas like material with a rubber backing that keeps the cover from slipping.  A real heavy duty elastic around the head rest keeps it in place at the top of the seat, otherwise the rest of the cover is kind of like a cooking apron held in place by the backing.  I really am surprised at how well it stays in place, it just does not move. I have had this for a few months now and am overly satisfied with my purchase.  Along with the Weathertech DigitalFit floor liners I bought, my car stays clean and protected.
B004NV42PQ|5|Cheapest alternative to making your own
B00FPR75VK|5|Love it!!
B000BZI4JS|5|Soon as I had installed the new ones the check engine light went out
B00L8CBQ9S|1|The master link broke two days after putting the chain on and it wasn't too tight or on hard acceleration
B002XM51CA|5|We bought two covers to cover each of the two steps on our trailer. The curved design is genius and fits our steps perfectly. Admittedly we haven't taken the trailer out yet after fitting these puppies, but these guys look like they will last a while and help minimize tracking of dirt and dust inside. We got black, which compliments very well our likewise black colored steps. Pleased with purchase.
B006FSOHBY|1|It was the wrong item I was looking for. My existing key broke and I thought I could trade out the pieces with my broken one but couldn't.
B008KIGCBA|5|So much better than the tiny stock ones. They are well worth the money
B00G6IOO4I|3|Didn't need it but good product
B00MU5X17M|5|Awesome product.
B00OT59QLQ|4|good
B009EDYZ0K|5|The clamp was just what I needed. Looks great on my chopper
B0066R1GB8|5|VERY NICE
B00BV1UPLG|3|Had a mount fail 3 weeks after installing. They sent me a replacement, after much escalated back and forth discussion.
B00D1CQVIY|2|I am disappointed in this item. I purchased this to put on my atv for a light bar I got with it and everything was good until just a little bit of water got on to the rocker switch and shorted it out. If it is designed to be for an off road vehicle, it should be waterproof, not water resistant, but it's not even that.
B000BHQXGC|1|The pic it totally misleading and the rating is also misleading. The description does not mention that it does not come with mounting brackets.
B0039BQGHS|5|Perfect fit, superb design, high quality, and fast shipment (arrived like 4 days earlier than projected)!
B00LEBLI82|3|one out of six did not work.
B00397B7NK|5|Good stuff
B004T636JS|5|Good
B002WHABF8|5|Perfect parts. The smooth drive of my car has been restored. Great product.
B000COB5MQ|2|Keeps getting stuck in the tailgate when closed!!
B004D0EAUE|5|Fit and works as expected
B000KL72DC|1|I purchased weather tech mats over Lloyds in March 2015. Within a few months the mats began to curl up on all ends.  I contacted tech at weathertech. After about 8 responses from the tech, I could not convince the tech I had a problem. I provided photos from all angles showing the mat curled up on all ends like a old tortilla.  After much aggravation I dropped the emails as I could not convince the tech I had a bad weathertech product.<br />I will never believe their ads or purchase their products.
B005GUQTUY|5|Great fit...f250 bench
B00XAX4B9A|5|Smart protection
B004P9DJSC|5|Truly the best freezer / refrigerator you can buy. We also opted for the remote display as we are using in our RV for extra storage.<br />Built very well.
B0002JMDFO|5|Great product 🚗🚗🚗
B0002F9YHI|4|Great for conditioning the leather seats in my car.  No excessively stick residue.  I plan to use it on some living room chairs next.
B00R3LYF7S|5|I have two in the back of our nissan pathfinder. They fit perfectly across the back behind the third row seat.
B00J11NWDG|3|Fit well. Awkward to roll up in the cab, have to get out to roll it tight enough for the velcro to reach. Takes up alot of space when rolled up. But it does keep the cab cooler than without it.
B005R4LJ9A|1|Terrible the lights looked cool but it wasn't sealed. Water got in quickly and not it doesn't work right
9539751047|5|Exactly what was needed for my new swing !
B00EEZUGRY|4|It's very sturdy, and surprisingly heavy! I picked it up and almost dropped it because I wasn't expecting it to be so hefty. The weight isn't as noticeable when you put it on. The hood has plenty of room, and the thumb holes in the cuffs are a must for wearing gloves or wearing the hoodie under a jacket during colder weather.<br /><br />The material is very thick, and I actually feel like it provides a lot of protection. The CE armor inside can be removed, via velcro-enclosed pockets on the inside of the hoodie (note that it's not exactly easy to take out or put in, but it's not too bad). The armor itself is pretty heavy duty rubber in the shoulders and elbows, and a thick and tough &#34;foamboard&#34; material in the back. The logo patches on the front and back are very thick and add protection to the chest and upper back, plus they are reflective and, more importantly, look very badass. The belt loop snap straps help keep the hoodie down and cover any crack that may result from bending or the wind causing it to ride up.<br /><br />WHY 4 STARS: This hoodie runs small. I ordered a size that I thought would be just a little looser and comfortable. When I got the hoodie and tried it on, it FIT. Not exactly too small, but I'm wishing I had ordered the next size up. Other than that, zero disappointments.
B00651C4EI|3|This antenna installs easily with the provided adapters and looks cool but you will loose some reception depending on where you are.  I live in the city and have had a couple of issues with reception.  I dont usually go too far outside the city so I can't really speak to the reception quality in those areas.
B005FL5XPQ|5|My husband was very happy about this purchase plus it saved us a lot of money as he installed them himself
B00F7H0NV2|5|As described, arrived promptly
B007Z4XHPY|5|Looks sharp. We have a jeep grand cherokee limited 1999. My bf cut the bumper from the grill (we didn't realize they were one peice) so that we could install this new grill. Fit perfectly. Lo e it!
B006DEVAAG|5|Great fit and the directions for measuring worked well. Have no complaints yet. We'll see how they hold up in the long term
B00Y2CJ95O|5|Awesome
B0036IA6JI|2|Fit perfect thanks for your help.
B008YDD6J2|5|Love them . Perfect fit @
B00P4EA53O|5|This fits perfectly in my 2015 Honda Fit and works great.
B004GDA0CK|5|fit the van perfect, still in use no issues at all. comes ready to paint
B00G49DVGG|3|Smell isn't good
B00BBFT4NC|4|great, just could be a little smaller
B000C2OFN4|4|Compressor is exact fit for vehicle. It arrived in a timely manor was easy to install and works perfectly.
B001AX8AWQ|5|Received ahead of promise date. Nice bag.
B00PV5DFUQ|4|not 100% suitable for infiniti G37x, but it's ok to use
B007KOC1MO|5|Order received in good time.  Practiced on scrap glass to get the &#34;feel&#34; for how it works.  Using a regular marking pencil, I circled the 8 inch long scratch on the car rear side window, on the inside of the glass, as a guide.  Then, using only the felt pad supplied, i applied the cerium oxide and was able to rub out essentially all of the scratch in about 20 minutes.  I didn't expect to be able to eliminate the deeper part of the scratch, but nothing shows.  Woo Hoo!
B00OKJXVVC|5|I've been using this helmet for a month.  Good quality and it fits great.
B0027QR2SI|2|Very very small might hold a soda can or two. But if you're willing to empty your trash from your car every day this might work
B000C9KOFU|5|👍
B00E1C6XOK|5|This helmet is gorgeous. The colors are very vibrant and the pattern works really well. Plus the fit is great (I got the medium BTW). This is a really high quality helmet, especially for the low price!
B00INVF4PY|5|Good wire for my mobile ham radio.
B00T36TGL6|2|The front door ventshades fit perfectly and I discovered the ventshades for the rear doors are at least one inch to long after the front ones were already installed. There's no option to contact the seller available like most orders.
B006LGKIM2|3|Seemed sturdy enough, just didn't work on my bike because the bike I was using had a weird bar that was round so no way to put this on it.
B00AFV7DI6|5|Fits truck, easy to use.
B0000AYJ8T|5|A great American flag for our Envoy.  Fits into the receiver with no problem and can be locked in place.  Had to work to get the flag mounted to the mounting bracket as it required a little bending to get the mounting screws in place.  But no big deal.  Great looking flag and good size.
B004I0LDA4|5|Looks to be of good quality, and is a good price.
B00OH0S5Y2|5|My old cheap leds were dead after 1yr. After reading some reviews on how bright these were I got some.<br />Honestly, these are bright, a lot brigher than my old one. Amazing! Only time will tell how long these last, so far 3m+ and still bright
B00042KJQ4|5|great product
B000JFN9WW|4|Would have gotten 5 stars if it came with the compressor adapter. Used it to change the oil in my Z4M. Worked perfectly. Not sure why people complain about the hose length. I just connected two of the included hoses together to make one long one. Since the Z has a filter on top, no crawling under the vehicle was necessary.
B000FQ0BSA|4|Would have given it five stars but it didn't fit my application.  My fault.
B00EAJMWSA|5|Items as described, prompt shipping.
B00GWFVD3K|5|These are bright and really work well
B00SJETRZI|3|These rain guards arrived in a timely manner. Wasn't the easiest to install, & definitely wasn't as good as previous ones I've bought. They're ok, but not the best.
B004R35Y02|5|Quick delivery, easy install,  absolutely nothing to complain about.
B0055CYH98|5|Perfect fit
B009FU7CUC|5|My only regret is that I waited so long to swap to Bilstein 5100 series shocks.
B003ZE6NW2|5|great product
B00VSDCJ0C|5|Great instructions, packaging, and easy to apply.
B000VKOD9S|5|Perfect fit for my 2011 Honda Odyssey!  Good Product - Great Value!
B00CFBT90O|5|Awesome!
B00D8DR0AO|5|This stuff is awesome, especially in SoCal with drought
B00K3GBRQ2|5|These are as they are advertised - extremely bright!  They negated the need for me to purchase a set of auxiliary reverse lamps.
B004X8SRLE|5|Nice
B00JBICD8Y|2|More Chinese built crap. Doesn't mount securely, does not properly cover factory hole in fender, no intructions, only reason it gets two stars is that I can repurposed them fairly easy thanks to the wiring plugging directly into the bulb socket.
B0023VIMCW|5|Fit like a glove - had to watch a U Tube video to figure what all needed to be removed to install it, but it works (and looks) great.
B00HXPSTOO|5|Looks great, not cheaply built, engraving came out beautiful. Picture is after a few months wear and tear
B00ELHNKB4|5|best price anywhere
B00QPQD1NQ|5|Excellent
B006TMAE1S|5|MATCHES MY PAIN PERFECTLY ON MY 2003 BMW 325I.... I COVERED A LOT OF MARKS UP WITH THIS AND YOU CANT EVEN TELL ... THIS PAINT WORKED GREAT
B0081ZZXO4|5|Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.
B004HUKF54|5|Great product! Very high quality and fits perfectly in my 2012 Camaro SS. Lightning fast shipping also!
B004LOZXZS|3|Not an exact duplication of the factory striping but good.  The main difference is the &#34;Cosworth Twin Cam&#34; - the rest of the striping accents seem to be well done.
B00MUAI7JO|5|Replaced ALL  the bulbs in my Travel Trailer with these, pulls about 1/3 the power..<br />with NO loss of light..
B0096UAU3M|4|Really bright. Looks good. Just wish it had more wire
B0062A7M2G|5|Bought this to cover the yucky faux wood trim on my Subaru Legacy. Very high quality, thick material with texture so it almost looks like the genuine thing (carbon fiber.) Very pliable with a little bit of heat. Car's interior looks awesome. Like it should have from the factory.
B00ANZW28U|5|Easy to use.  Folds to take up only a tiny space.  Really makes a difference when I have to leave my car in the hot sun.  Keeps the car significantly cooler.
B00CC2ZU4K|5|This is my second set of these. My first set lasted a little over 2 years and was very happy with their performance until that time. One ballast went bad after the warranty period so I decided to buy a second set. Recommended to anyone who has projector style headlights and want a bright bright headlight!
B001GXO0F6|4|Works well.  Nice carrier
B000EQM0X0|5|Worked for the jeep and wasn't 100 bucks
B00594A9H6|3|Works. A little hard to install without leaking.
B000Q6UEW2|5|hard to get unfolded. but is holding up nicely
B003TU662Y|4|It works pretty good for the shower and seems to save a little time compared to scrubbing by hand, especially on the floor of our showers. I originally bought it to scrub hard ward stains on pool tile, but it did not help for that.
B00C4QI35W|5|Bought these for street use, wound up taking them to the dunes too.  They don't disappoint.  Lightweight, breathable, but the padding feels like it'll provide great protection.
B006166OR0|5|Have it on my car now
B003021HZ2|5|look great on my truck...had to do some small modifications to them which wasnt a big deal and i love the way they look when lit up....
B007HA7RF2|5|It worked came fast
B00JPJLK9W|3|This is a very good quality replacement item for my RV door.  However it was not secure in the original box allowing it to slide around, did not have a protective film covering the plexiglass so therefore it was scratched up worse than the part that I am replacing after 3 years of use. Way way too expensive of a product for there to be any scratches or flaws.
B00A1X9AES|5|OEM, and good price, what more could you want? Stock up and save coin on future oil changes!
B00REPYU3C|5|Great product and was as expected.
B00IV50JTS|1|Doesn't work at all
B009TI5B3U|5|Awesome addition to an older boat for additional cupholders!
B000CO94E2|2|This cap doesn't have the plastic clips that lock it in place so you will have to super glue it on or it keeps falling off. This is not an improvement from the old cap that had the clips broken off, but if you need the switch you can't beat the price.
B0049Z4TO0|5|Perfect fit
B000CO86EG|5|Does what it was designed to do and inexpensive
B00EC0YVE0|5|Fit like a glove extremely easy to replace not tools or glue just clip on
B0002YQSQO|5|Great filter
B003UMRXSW|4|great
B00BZAGLG6|5|Great product, fit perfectly, arrived quickly
B00G9BRR0K|4|Seems to be a decent helmet...color is a little more pink than Orange...and size seems to run a little small..just a tad...
B00192JGDU|5|One od the best items we have purchased for our camper.
B003EOZLEO|4|Look great BUT these rails require removal of stock Rubicon Rock Rails.  I have a 2015 Rubicon Unlimited and the stock rock rails are some of the best money can buy - don't underestimate the stock Rubicon parts.  This is a cosmetic decision as these will not protect the body like the stock rock rails.  Notice there are two connection point on these rails.  They bolt under two frame mounts and the stock rock rails bolt to the Jeep in four places.  These will flex into the body if run against a rock.  Again - look great, but your rock rail functionality is degraded.
B004APM12G|5|Great tool. I do monthly checks of my tires and this makes it easy.  Lets me know if I am wearing tires unevenly before they become an issue.  I use it to check the dealers measurements when the car is in for routine maintenance. You might be surprised with the differences.
B00LOY0UGK|3|Sure this guy would work some where, but in my 09 Ram SLT, it was a no go.
B006VDB1EE|5|Fit perfect. A whole lot cheaper than getting one from John Deere
B00COOR73S|3|there ok no as clear as i thought but will work
B000IZ2AVE|5|Great product
B004TDO884|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B001VZN6ZE|1|do not buy this product my truck went through two sets of injectors in 2 months also it was blowing white smoke  and i spent thousands of dollars going through 12 injectors and  trying to find out  what the reason why it kept on blowing the injectors  . after the second timem mechanic said  that a new  pistion  . i cleared all the settings to stock and its been having no problems since i got rid of this garbage tuner that dosent do anything but cost you thousands of dollars. this super chips company is garbage
B000B90MIU|1|While I like the idea behind this product, it keeps coming apart. If it would stay together, I would like it.
B007N6YTRE|5|Lift supports were received in a timely manner and were very easy to install. Lift supports working great. Very satisfied with<br />this transaction. Thank you.
B00BUHLCHW|5|Great price for Honda 2013 Civic!
B0128U6BO8|4|Perfect
B00NRFZ0L4|1|Don't buy this snow plow for Can Am Commanders.  The mounting plate has 5&#34; long plow tabs that hang down in the front and interfere with your ground clearance.  The concept of removing the snow plow with quick release pins works fine, but the mount plate is still on the side by side and interferes when riding on trails, rock climbing or any four wheeling activity.  It requires that you remove or install the entire mounting plate every time you attach the plow.  Big pain!  This is a really bad design!
B00D3YEGO6|5|The box is great that it comes in as is the hardware and cleaning cloth. This is a beautiful product and looks expensive.<br />Application is easy. Great gift for someone or yourself. Won't be disappointed! Even comes with replacement jewels if any fall off!
B0045JYUY4|5|This worked great and was very easy to install.
B000BM8RT8|5|ok
B009NWPPLU|5|Perfect fit and a good price.
B00F3RM20Q|5|Great quality, love the sticker, looks great, my little nephew seems to like it to haha
B002GJM5B0|1|Didn't fit as advertised.
B00B8KBNDY|4|Make the interior look so cool and so different
B00FZR1UW0|1|cheap plastic, doesn't worth the price<br />the product is full of scratches and the finishing is bad
B00VOL4LR2|2|Not worth the money. Poor quality.
B000EDUTWC|5|fast shipping, packaged great, works good no problems
B007TYATVA|5|Order this got it on time and it was just what I wanted .!!
B005FOMYMI|5|These are great boots.  My daughter loves them.  The quality and workmanship are excellent.  Now she wants element pants and shirt.
B001GPUY9U|5|Good quality embossed (stamped) aluminum plate.  Second one I order and very pleased with Amazon vendor.  Would recommend if you are looking for Florida flag plate.
B001A1PPBM|5|I have not put them to the test and hope that I never have to, but they are good quality, light weight and cool to use in the summer.
B000NKCM2Q|5|Sounds good! Increases performance! Very Happy!
B00CM0Q38O|5|Good value
B000GTUU4G|5|always love this product, cleans my bike fast and with little effort
B00QPQD1NQ|5|As expected
B00450NBKW|5|Looks great. Good quality. Has been in place for 6 months and no discernible fading or wear.
B00076RLC2|5|Fast shipping. Good product
B004ZF39T0|5|I received it in two days, and It fit right in. I like the package by the way.
B00NOMYQJC|5|Excellent
B00658US6M|4|It is very convenient source of light and fire civilization outside
B000JZZ632|5|Quebec Canada
B000C9TPUK|5|fit perfect.ford f250 xlt 4x4 460
B004I18L58|5|Great prices. Order arrived when they said. Fit my car great. Would diffently order from them again
B01264D2DY|4|I purchased 2 covers for my recumbent trikes which are stored outside during the non-winter months in a beach community. The cover is large enough to completely protect the trikes all the way to ground level, keeping the trikes safe from the salt air and any sand that gets blown around. The fabric is light and easily manipulated to ensure full coverage and protection. The covers would have easily earned 5 stars had they come equipped with a few nylon loops along the bottom edges to add versatility and the ability to further ensure that the covers stay in place on very windy days. That said, the covers are equipped with elastic corners for a tight fit, if they are used for their intended purpose of covering ATVs.
B003RQBKLC|5|This is a great quality charger, will work with 120v adapter.
B000C2QM1M|5|seemed very good as I used some to repair the ac in my silverado - will know better as time goes by if I don't have any leaks. would buy again
B00SQU1ZDW|5|Installed on both sides of my 2007 new body style Silverado. It was work getting to the ball joint, but these pressed right in. They look and feel heavy duty. So far the ride as good as new. I'll leave an update if I have issues.
B00HSFAR80|5|Not easy to install in a Nissan Rogue but this air filter made a world of difference to my car cabin air
B005JU5V6E|5|These have been running strong for the past 2.5 years. Might replace them in a few months but so far there is no major streaking or squeaking going on. These are pretty incredible as I've had worse luck with the Bosch Marathon series (bad after 8 months), but the Icons are proving to be no slouch. Highly recommend
B00NP61VDQ|5|These ice scrapers are made of a great material. They are durable and comfortable. The ones I had from last winter broke, but I do not believe they were very expensive, either. The scraper is nice and wide, which beats scraping the frost off my car with a credit card or ID. It's also nice and these come two per pack, so I can place one in both mine and my husband's cars. We live in apartments and do not rent garages, so these will be useful from time to time.<br /><br />It's still summer here in Texas, so I will update this review after our first freeze. At least I'll be ready for winter now!
B00F07VU02|5|Thanks
B0110CO95S|5|My package got 95% of the ones in the photos, and more. I got euphoric levels of excitement going through them to see what I got. Great for laptops, skateboards, and whatever you want to look cool. Definitely recommend!
B00JNEAQIA|5|Very good.  They fit perfectly and don't chip.
B0065N5XAI|5|Fit perfectly and installed easily--very impressed
B00JIHC36K|4|more yellowish than amber...was hoping for a deeper amber color. noticeably brighter
B0069EQT88|2|It worked for reception, but it broke the third or fourth time we were riding with in on the bike.  No longer usable!
B0050ITM24|5|Air cleaner was exactly as expected new and arrived quickly satisfied
B00GBZ6L74|5|like the original, great to keep the oem style
B00ZR4324K|5|Great addition to my Jeep. Simple easy to install Handles that look great and serve a purpose.  Highly recommended.  Can't beat the price.
B00BF0IGIM|5|Amazing..........love this on my car, so easy to fix it.
B000H8XORQ|5|Exact same as oem,  at a fraction of the price.
B00FSEP9MW|5|this unit replaced the stock damaged unit perfectly / exactly,came on time,excellent packaging.
B00029WRKU|3|It works pretty well for a tacoma. I would rate higher, but it vibrates a lot.. and one of the posts is already missing and I can't use one of them after maybe 3 tows. Only mirror really available for my truck.
B000GRZX7C|5|Awesome design, great looking jacket.  Leather is nice quality.  Will be buying a second one for my passenger next riding season.  Still a bit on the warm side on the really hot days, so I ended up buying an Alter Ego 3.0 for those days.  This one is still my #1 jacket though.
B00VS0T7IC|5|Great price for an accurate easy to use tire gauge.
B00LWGFWRC|1|Didn't fit the tag for a motorcycle tag as advertised
B005JPJMI2|5|This is very easy to use for that quick &#34;once over.&#34; Exactly what I was looking for.
B003E24MAA|5|Quiet and effective! No issue.
B007XE8C74|5|I got this so I wouldn't have to keep going to autozone to figure out my status in order to pass NYS inspection. Let's you know readiness in real time!
B00NQ19AG0|5|helped me find the correct number lock for the keys I had
B00G8XN5LO|4|Was wrong aplication. I had to use some parts from my old one
B000COD57O|5|Very nice.<br />Works every time.<br />I'd recommend and buy it again.
B0057FR9FC|5|Its hard to give a review for brake pads because there are different factors that are important to different customers.  The main marketing item for these are that they are quiet.  And they are quiet pads.<br /><br />* Quiet brake pads<br />* fit correctly<br />* come with a small packet of brake grease<br />* Made in Canada<br />* Stopping initial bite is good, but not very agressive<br />* Pads are dusting, after a few hundred miles your wheels will be darkened.
B00B3W5GU8|5|Perfect fit oem part
B00OZVLY14|1|the unit shipped to me does NOT fit. the rivets were too long and the window sits 1 inch to far back. My convertible top does not close now. I need help echanging for the correct part. QC must be pretty bad with this company
B004007EOG|5|another oil change!
B004FSEJZA|4|Works well
B001TI5IIQ|5|It really works !!!
B00HB0WUB4|2|Felt like i had to use triple the dosage to get oder control
B00B9H3X5C|5|It would have been great if my passenger side button was defective, but of course it's drivers side. It is super weird when you are picking up uber rides and they are like 'uhhh is this guy going to let us out?' - but now I can let them out, and they don't have to leave all creeped out!
B002P48KLK|5|I use this in my camper to monitor voltage from the inverter. Great unit.
B000E7D394|5|nice wire
B011DKBXBK|5|I bought this hesitantly due to the fact its a brand new product.  I am very pleased with the results.  The quality and ease of use was outstanding.<br />And it worked as advertised with the Boxster S and 991 S.  Big plus tech support was very prompt and helpful.  Its a self contained unit so no need for a PC.  Their software update was simple and available every 6 months.  It can also be used as a general OBD-II scanner for other vehicles.
B00HKSURTE|5|Great quality and whimsical gift was and still is a fun conversation piece.
B00D010TDY|5|Great
B0108U7XVA|1|I ordered these because of the &#34;super bright&#34; description - they lie. The light they cast is nothing more than that of a night light. I sent them back. Very disappointed. Not bright at All.
B00L84EKI0|1|This wrench broke on its maiden voyage.  Unfortunately my window for return has closed.
B00PM82M3S|5|Excellent!
B00GE9Y5ZC|5|All aftermarket parts should be designed with this much engineering. These are so simple to install it's not funny. Hint - turn front wheels to left lock and drivers front. Turn them to right lock and install passenger side. They even give you a Torx bit. Fit perfect utilizing factory hardware and look like they belong on the truck.
B0012BL8LG|2|Doesn't work with 36W USB Quick Charge 2.0 charger, interferes with car radio (shuts it off completely when near glove box). Does work with cooler though.
B000C5C2E0|5|very good wiper I will buy again
B000F220YC|5|fit the van perfect, still in use no issues at all.
B000FW61SI|4|smaller than i was expecting but does the job good item
B0081XO50Y|5|These lights are great!  Perfect fit, super easy to install, and they look great on my truck.  ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH INSTALLATION.  Mine were installed on a 2003 GMC  Sierra 1500 pickup and ithey were probably the easiest part i've ever installed.  Instructions were perfectly clear, no wires to cut and splice, just simply unplugged the old ones, set these in place and plugged them in.  You do have to &#34;splice&#34; the wires in for the Halos and leds to come on with your parking lights but they came with the &#34;quick splice&#34; connectors so there was no cutting or splicing per se......you just snap them in place on the correct wire for your parking lights.  All I had to have was a simple test light to determine which parking light wires were + or -.  Love the lights folks........HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
B00CBTRMZ4|5|I have this hooked up to two of my deep cycle marine batteries in my boat and love it. Cords from the unit to the batteries reach when I placed the unit near the center of my 17 foot boat, one battery is about 3 feet from stern and on about 3 foot from bow. Charge is achieved and maintained well.
B00U4AK7YK|5|excellent items... prompt delivery...
B002ONTBMO|5|As described, arrived promptly
B00FDWRJN6|5|Item as described
B004L7J9ZU|5|Fits 2016 explorer! Great buy
B000IZ3OH8|4|Filter itself seems fine. Disappointed that it didn't come with a new filter housing o-ring. Had to go fish the old one out of the trash...
B00QN9458U|1|It did not fit
B003RYOWH8|2|We are returning these.  They slide all over the seat - don't seem to stay fixed in place.
B000H2W270|3|Did not function as expected even after tuning.
B0000AYCFD|4|qiuck and easy
B00D39407O|5|Fit Great speedy delivery
B000CAINEI|4|Works really well in the Texas summer.
B001D6L14Y|1|Not orange like photo
B00KUUXC9Q|4|not dealership quality but not far from it.. worth the money..
B00K87QA54|5|So far so good...great replacement in my 2001 GSXR 750
B004HCM9H4|5|This stuff goes on easy, wipes off easy,many leaves a real nice shine and smooth touch. I was shocked by how easy it was to use.
B000FW2NEY|4|Was stated to keep the steering wheel cool in the heat.  Did not do very well in excess of 100 degrees.  Besides that very nice and comfortable to use.
B004DK4P5O|5|Works great
B0002F68JK|4|They have made some much needed modifications since the last one I bought 4 years ago. A little more material and straps to secure around the mirrors make this a better product.
B0001MQ7A4|3|Takes quit a long time to heat things up but does work
B00M9MM1WW|5|Great fit.
B00MP4OJTC|5|Very sturdy, this is my second plate and they look great.
B011JB9HKM|5|They were great I purchase all this this stuff banditry me very well
B010L76NHA|5|SOOOOO handy for using my GPS and/or cell phone.
B000OR18BE|5|Worked Great
B00SBZAG5U|5|Great product, quality and price!
B000EQJXVC|5|Worked great
B008JPSWBW|4|OEM product was liquid filled<br />It was a chore to extract old mount and new alignment or orientation should be considered prior to extraction and installation.
B00I0O5HE2|5|This is a perfect fit for Elantra 2012 with gamma 1.6L Engine. I dont know what amazon did that they put this unfit for elantra but this fits perfect. Just installed it today and hoping it will last and run smooth. SOLI DEO GLORIA (Glory to God Alone)
B00B7FC4DI|4|Haven't tried this yet (hope I don't need to frankly) , but like how it all fits in the handle and packs in a small area on my bike!
B00SAGVKKU|5|wife loves this set!
B00DHVK7SO|4|Great goggles for the price.  Your glasses will want to be fairly small for these to clear your glasses.  Large horn-rimmed not so much.
B0035RZ280|5|Works like a charm!
B00QMWQK2M|3|They slide on the bottom of the car, but will work for the price.

B00BJ4EF0C|5|I bought it mostly for the rubber boot on my 99 Miata, but decide to change the bushings while I was at it. Everything was a perfect fit.
B00F23BNUG|5|I am very pleased with this product! Arrived on time, in good order and the bulbs work great! I use them on my JD Lawn Tractor. Great visability

B00VVGDF54|5|Fits correctly and allows one to bring a Wavian NATO gas can into compliance with CARB.

B004LX3AXQ|4|saved my battery that went dead after leaving bike on over night
B00EXG7ERO|4|Worked well. Fast delivery
B00TSSSFNE|5|These look great and seem to be of good quality.
B000C41N3W|1|This product is shoddily made! It was missing the gearing to connect to the window track. Not well built. How could parts such as this make it down an assembly line and then be placed in a box and no one notices that there are pieces missing?
B00EDU8VOU|4|Tinted so nice!!  Comfortable!
B00G258KAY|5|Very nice.  Sturdy
B00092RESK|3|Left a little cloudy/hazing on my dark colored paint, but a great shine and hopefully the best UV protection available

B00I9TMNM2|1|Crap
B0076AKISQ|5|Perfect fit for my 2015 Priusv
B002P8EMRW|5|Replaced the caps on all my nitrogen filled tires, top notch.
B00HVVVEYM|5|This bag is as good as all the previous reviews say it is. It's a little tricky to get everything in it due to the fact it is a soft bag. My suggestion would be place the corner items first to shape the bag, We used this bag with the  [[ASIN:B001G4Z5J0 Pro Series 63153 Rambler Hitch Cargo Carrier for 2&#34; Receivers]]and it was perfect. We also bought the [[ASIN:B000O5DUP8 ROLA 20174 Red Cargo Carrier Light Kit]] which fit perfectly. We didn't use the straps that come with the bag, we bought rachet straps for a little more security. We drove over 700 miles and had no problem. It even rained and nothing got wet. PERFECT for college bound parents taking there kids to school. This will come in handy on the way home from college as well. I might also suggest buying a lock for the hitch. We didn't at first but decided to get one during our travels and it gave us piece of mind the carrier wouldn't walk off.
B00O826XKM|5|Hi, I have been a user of this device so 2 years now, and just came across it on Amazon. If you are looking to install this type of auto device I highly recommend it. I used to use just a plain OBD reader, so when I knew there was a problem, I could diagnose it. The difference is the intelligence in the Mojio device notifies you. Two example, the first was it let me know I was having an enjoy issue and when I ran the code, I found that this was a vehicle recall event and it was completely covered by the manufacturer. I would not have known this nor gotten it to the dealer before it became serious issue and something I might have paid for myself. Secondly, it started to notify me of an intermittent problem that was showing up and then going away. Again, I got it repaired before any major issues and it costing me a lot. And thats just the diagnostics, not even talking about the other 4 supported apps that I run on the device as well. If your looking for value versus cost, this is it.
B011P4DQBY|5|/i love how it makes THE CAR LOOK BRAND NEW AND SHINING AND LOOKS LIKE YOU JUST GOT THE Car
B00PQIWOCI|1|Sometime low price means low quality.  What did I expect...<br /><br />Attached one of them and it stuck out too far looking ridiculous - I was also concerned about the quality of the material and feared that if I was to lay my bike down the material would crack on impacts or skid.  Needles to say I did not end up using them and they sit in a bag in my garage.
B00H9S71LW|5|This connects fast to my 2002 Prius, and I can clear my random battery codes. I work on the hybrid battery myself, so every once in a while, I get an &#34;uneven states of charge&#34; code when a module pair has a different capacity than the rest of the pack. This tool is certainly better (and smaller) than the little ELM tool it replaced.<br /><br />I haven't had it long enough to test out whether this will drain my 12v if left plugged in, which was a big reason for my having purchased it. Other reviewers say the autosleep function works fine. The LEDs remain active with the keys out, so we'll see. I'm happy so far. The Android app is cleaner and better than the Torque app.<br /><br />***EDIT***<br />Well, I've had the tool for 3 months and it has never drained the battery leaving it plugged into my OBD-II port all the time, so the autosleep function does work. I haven't really looked into all the features of the app, as I really only wanted this for the code reading/clearing ability while not having to unplug it all the time due to battery drain. Thankfully, I can say this powerful little device exceeds my expectations, and I'm glad I purchased it.
B008N1ZXPK|1|I ordered 1 got 2!!!  They were to large.
B00DKDFVVC|5|This combined with the  Happy Camper Organic RV Holding Tank stuff eliminated the odor. That was the goal :-)
B000C59WFM|5|Used this for my 2000 Chrysler 300M!<br /><br />Solid product at a great price.
B00EWIS2R4|5|Awesome
B0024NO9GW|5|So far these lights have worked well.  They fit very well and seem to be a quality unit, with all the adjustments having plenty of room to properly adjust the lights once they were in the truck.  If I didn't replace them myself, I wouldn't know they were aftermarket lights.
B009F59HR8|5|It was what I needed at fair price , fast delivery!
B003D2DX1U|2|bolt holes so not line up at all wtf nothing like drilling new hole when its suppose to fit correctly
B008PAJCRE|2|I really really wanted to like these shocks especially after reading all the great reviews. In all honesty, they ride rougher than the standard Harley shocks. Yes I got the standard springs and yes there set on the softest ride. 2008 Ultra Classic CVO
B003UM7B98|5|Nice floor jack for the $$$ So much easier to use than cheap scissor jacks. Feel like a pro.
B000X90YUO|5|It works excellent . An I don't have to go to the gas station an put a bag of quarters to pay for the airThank's.
B00EDFM5QU|5|I bought 20 of these for my 2010 Jayco.  I was confused at first about the kind of bulbs I needed, since the whole socket comes out of the base, but the wires are permanently attached.  It wasn't until I fiddled with it a little bit that I realized that the glass part of the bulbs just slides right out. I checked the size of the socket against the old bulbs, and they are almost exactly the same size (within 1/2 millimeter).  These are noticably whiter/bluer than the old bulbs.  Also, they aren't quite as bright, but they are more directional so they are bright enough.  Best of all, these are inexpensive.  I had no DOA bulbs.  They come in a little smoke-colored static-resistant envelope that smells slightly fishy.  They do take a little force to push them in (pushing on the socket part only), but I was able to change out all 20 in about 10 minutes.<br /><br />Now the priceless part of this is the energy savings.  For longer camping trips at non-electric sites, it will allow us to go longer without worrying about running out of electricity.  Granted, you still have the water pump and furnace to worry about, but being able to use 1/7 of the electricity for lighting for the cost of a few bulbs and 10 minutes of time is well worth the investment in my book.<br /><br />If you have an RV and you're on the fence, just buy these.  You won't regret it.
B00405056A|5|excellent and matches coach color. A bit pricey for what you get but time will tell if it was worth the extra bucks
B0073X8TIM|5|The antenna fit perfectly, just screw it on using your hands. Much smaller thanumber the regular s2000 antenna but awesome. Recommended 2008 s2k
B005EV22IS|5|fix well no problems
B0017TC1A0|5|Awesome sounds great awesome fitment very pleased
B00AB1Y55Y|5|Love this plate cover. Looks great on my blue Corolla. I get compliments all the time.
B005G8XTKY|3|Nice, a little smaller than expected.  With larger breasts, it may not cover everything. I did loosen the laces in the middle to cover sides better but, if you like full coverage, this won't work for you.
B00069CN2I|1|Box came with two right mirrors. Reordered and the second box had the same problem. Cancelled order after that.
B004GEJ4WQ|4|Good
B00ESYQY0O|4|Bought this for my wife when she rides in my truck. It works well and I'd give it 5 stars if it did not require frequent tightening and adjustment. Does a very good job of cutting glare for her.
B00MBP6UJC|1|Makes my car hotter
B004J9LC96|5|Easy to install.
B00JJ68FT4|1|I purchased one of the OxGord covers to replace a Saddleman cover that dry rotted, so I read the reviews on the OxGord brand and how great it is, well I call B S , this cover was on the truck 2 months and no one had even sat on the passenger side which is disintegrating from dry rot, these OxGord covers are POJ just as the Saddleman cover is and was.<br />SAVE YOUR MONEY find a real upholstery shop and get it done correct the first time.<br />I will NEVER EVER purchase these brands of covers mentioned in this review, if your smart you'll do the same .
B00466V9AY|5|Works great and very easy to set up.
B00U868BN4|5|So far so good.
B00Q0CZUQQ|5|Great part and price. No hassle.
B00H2VVL0S|5|Great product! Does what it says
B00T8ZNBTA|5|&#34;These pedals are so F-ing cool. As soon as I installed them on my car I drove my wife to the nail salon, so those little Vietnamese coolies could pretty up her toe nails. I matched the nail polish to the red color on the petals, then I took 55 photos of her feet on the pedals. OMG! Those have to be the hottest pictures ever. I have spanked it countless times while enjoying those fabulous pics.&#34;
B00XZ9N3AW|5|I just got this product today and it only took me 5 minutes to program it. It work right away. This is an awesome product and only took 2 days to get this product from the seller. I will definitely recommend this awesome product.
B00Z0B6C8I|5|Just got it in today, better than I expected (I thought it was plastic but its metal) used some 3M between the plate and the frame for a snug fit. My FRS is now awesome, without this plate it was lame
B00NEJR9SU|5|Must have for camaro owners.
B007BLMWXO|5|Best bang for your buck.  Get away from copper plugs and get a way better running motor.  More pep, economy, and smother idle.
B000BZEZS2|1|Definitely not the one in this picture had to return
B00E0IK3LY|5|Mine came with a rivet style link. It is very smooth, only have 100 miles on it so far but very impressed.
B003U1NQOS|5|Waiting for smokey to pull me over
B0002JN2EU|5|Great Value
B00M8KD67E|5|love this, fits true to size. its light and it breathes nicely when I'm riding. the material is not hot or heavy.
B00H58W59Y|5|I like this tool better than the Assenmacher since it grips just as well and does not require a seperate 24mm wrench or socket to use. This one has a hole for 1/2 ratchet wrenches or breaker bars. Quality is very good.<br /><br />The only thing about it is, it's not impact resistant. But neither is the Asssenmacher. Don't put an impact gun on it. You'll break it, that is, if you don't break the oil filter housing first.
B00UIULNZI|3|there ok not as clear as i thought but will still work
B003ZWE6W8|5|this snapped in with ease fit is perfect easy to install and looks great.
B00FEIL85E|5|Still wish these would come with a CD that had some sort of program to load on a computer and help better identify items.
B007ZGDR0W|5|Perfect stance for my car not to low to scrape. Leveled and still able to fit 18 in rims
B0009IBJE4|5|I love the size of this thing.  It's so small, but it works perfectly.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase.  I got it on sale, but after using it, I would probably buy it at full price over the others.  Check before buying to make sure exactly what charger you need for your application(s).
B0006IX7YC|3|This works like advertised. The ABS pipe to my black tank is longer than this thing is. I am going to cut the ABS and install a clean out port so this will work better.
B00P91JA42|5|they are fine
B00E9J3QPO|5|This jersey is perfect for the socal weather, hot and usually, hotter. I use it for mountain biking.
B002GJFIHS|5|Looks just as described
B00EC0XTBG|5|very nice mirror like original .
B000C9OJA6|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00AWPQKWU|3|Is this fit sea doo 2008? 255?
B001NZYO2Q|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.  Working properly 2 months after installation.
B006E59DPS|3|hard to peel off the backing paper'
B003334QAQ|5|It fit great and it was a good price, if and when I need another one I would buy it here.
B00UIU74OM|5|Verey very good, it fill my expect, thanks...
B00MQ1B456|5|Worked perfect and easy
B00AMKY6PS|1|This item was delivered and NOT the size that was described in the item details! It's only 4 1/8&#34; x 2 3/4&#34;... extremely disappointed!!!
B000FGCZIY|5|Bought this for my Typhoon intake after the filter got damaged, no thanks to me.<br /><br />It works just as advertised and filters air.<br /><br />Good job K&N, as usual!
B005ZWM0R4|4|Allows me to monitor engine sensors nicely.  Not sure what I'm doing yet but the information is there for the taking.
B000BVN8NY|5|Unbeleivable fit on 88 cougar seats. used some hog rings on bottom to stretch the material for full coverage.  Not tall enough for the headrests, but they were dyed black and look great .  The seats now look even tighter than the picture.  Hope the seams are strong.  Lumbar and side support great and keep you firmly in the seat.
B001V8U12M|5|Works perfect in my cordless drill !! Makes my jack lowering and lifting a breeze!!
B000JIND4S|5|Works great
B0041TU56A|5|Installed it in about 10 minutes. it looks just like OEM equipment I cant tell the difference. Happy I spent money on this. I would buy again (hopefully I wont have to though).
B003TUA5W6|5|great kit
B00JEUI2ZW|5|great price exact fit
B0010AN0SI|5|Exactly what I needed for my Fimco LG-5-P Sprayer.  Fit perfectly and works awesome!
B005NA6FJ2|2|smallish and the suction cups don't hold it up too well.
B00JM208IG|5|Works great after thinning out the new cam arm at the area where the stud passes through. The cam arm was too thick to allow the key lock to work correctly when the C clip was installed. Don't know if this was a problem for others who bought this item. I am still happy with the purchase.
B0126YHORE|4|The lights are very bright. Brighter than other LED bulbs I had. These are larger than standard size 194 glass bulbs though. They’re larger than my old LEDs which were larger than the glass bulbs too. (picture of 3 bulbs together) This light uses 9 small LEDs on each side instead of 1 larger LED per side. That’s a difference of 5 LEDs versus 45 LEDs. So as you can imagine, there is a lot more light output. (picture of tag lights shining) The negative is that by being a little bit larger overall, there are some applications where this style of bulb may not fit. (picture of map light not fitting) They fit most places I tried though. (picture of door light maybe?). Note that if you plug in a LED bulb and it doesn’t work, unplug and turn it around. Unlike regular glass bulbs, LEDs need the electricity to flow a specific direction. I will also point out that as a general practice, I do use electrical grease in the sockets before plugging in any LED bulbs to ensure a clean connection and prevent flickering.<br /><br />This was originally posted on CreativeMadnessMama.com
B00537FR08|5|kinda of a big condom, but it works in a pinch...
B0134IKZ3Q|5|Looks nice!
B00NLMD1GE|1|BAD QUALITY<br /><br />Absolutely the worst item quality, I got this car cover and it lasted just over 30 days! It literally melted away, got so thin it ripped. I realize the sun in Arizona is brutal but this item was supposed to have SUN protection!  I emailed the seller numerous times and sent photos of the issues, have not gotten any responses - check out the photos of the super thin material
B0038B0RC4|5|worked perfect!!!!
B00XDAB0DK|5|[[VIDEOID:ffb39d1c226bcf56f1c20b89a52532a]] I got the opportunity to review this and I jumped on it because I really needed one in the back of my Tahoe. I had so much stuff back there slamming around it wasnt funny. I have all of my works rain gear and hats and car cleaning stuff..It was just a mess. I git this and right our of the box I was I was impressed. It is very heavy duty and well built. What was so impressive is that it is very sturdy but it also folds up nice if you aren't using it. Very small footprint folded up and has heavy buckles that keep it folded up. It has some velcro on the bottom to help stick to your autos carpet too..I don't think they left anything out on this one. Even carrying handles...NICE. Grab and go. I honestly looked for something that I thought could be improved on this but I couldn't find a thing. They covered it all with this one.<br /><br />Guys this is getting a very high 5 star review from me...I would give it a 20 if Amazon let me. I will be buying another for my wife's car. As soon as she saw it she wanted one too. I am sure there are a million uses you could this for but in the back of my Tahoe SUV it worked perfect!<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br />I received a sample product to test and evaluate. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review.
B000AS5RNM|1|Review I seen before I bought this looked like it would be okay for the deal I got.  However dial of gauge somehow on its own went almost all the way to its max (about 1/4&#34; just short of it).  I had last used this in February with temps in high 20's.  When I took it out of tool box and tried to use it today I noticed the needle near max. My garage gets hot in the summer (up to the 90's) and cold in the winter, this year went down into the teens). I pulled back the rubber shield and could not find a way of resetting it to zero.  Unit only lasted about 9 months. I am puzzled as to why it failed as it did, surely temp fluctuation in my garage should not have caused this.<br /><br />Now when I look at the reviews there is a large percentage in the 1 & 2 stars, so I would not re-buy this model.
B001EOWQY4|4|good product. it worked for me.
B00F7NEREU|1|to short for the car seat.
B000OZTPIY|5|Wish that I had found it sooner.
B000HTNODE|5|I have only had this for a day so can not comment on long term viability.  That said, it appears to be professional quality.  Everything you need to use this instrument is included in a nice protective case.  The instructions are very straight forward & easy to understand.  I was able to get through the instructions, calibrate the instrument and get a freeze point reading on a new sample of antifreeze of known concentration (based on manufactures claims) within 10 minutes.  The antifreeze I was testing is Dex-Cool which is a newer concoction specified by GM and also for my new Yanmar Diesel engine.  I tried using several different &#34;floating ball&#34; testers getting readings of 0 degrees F to -10 degrees F versus the manufactures claim of protection to -34 degrees F for the Dex-Cool which concerned me since the engine could be exposed to winter temperatures as low as -20 to -25 degrees F.  I called Havoline tech service, the supplier of the Dex-Cool, to get their input and was informed that the only way to measure the freeze point of Dex-Cool was to use a Refractometer / Spectrometer.  This instrument does the job.  It provided a reading of the antifreeze sample within a couple degrees of the manufacturers specified freeze point.  It can also be used to test the charge status of wet cell lead/acid batteries.  You get what you pay for and, although expensive, this thing works on a variety of coolants and battery electrolyte (battery acid) so, in my opinion, it is an excellent value.
B0040M4MKS|5|Great product, quality and price!
B0029TQDLA|1|Broken after 6 months of use.
B00BD4U45S|2|They were not advertised accurately.  I have them and they are not as advertised.  I am still trying to get the right piece.  These are just decals.  I need the actual carbon fiber hard piece of trim for my driver side door upright post.
B00HCROOR4|5|Yup, they worked
B00KWGK0WA|5|Great price, delivered on time as promised.
B005JU5XE4|5|These have been running strong for the past 2.5 years. Might replace them in a few months but so far there is no major streaking or squeaking going on. These are pretty incredible as I've had worse luck with the Bosch Marathon series (bad after 8 months), but the Icons are proving to be no slouch. Highly recommend
B00BZR3NH4|1|Garbage.  Need to replace, it's been less that 3 months
B003UM9GDM|3|be careful using this equipment. be sure to have all the placements set as using. picks up my motorcycle. the hardest part was the 'jacking' function. sometimes jack would not go ALL the way down, in place, like supposed to.
B001810SHA|3|No substitute for professional servicing but will get the AC working better in a bind.
B00IX5MOD0|2|I'm in agreement with almost every other reviewer - they look awesome when first installed on my Land Rover. 90 days later, the logo chip is so faded because of the heat of the LED that it is just a blurry light projecting on the ground. I guess that's why Windfire Auto offers free lifetime replacement logo chips (with a $3.69 handling fee).  If you don't mind replacing the logo chips every few months, then it's ok. Here's a cut and paste from their FAQ section on their website:<br /><br />Due to high temperature in car and LED, the logo chips slide color may fade in 3~4 months.<br />Don’t panic, our LED comes with lifetime free logo replacement. The coupon code was sent by email when the order is shipped. If you don’t have the code, send us email with your order number and we will give you the coupon code.<br />So then, pick up to 2 logo chips, checkout with the code and they will be free.<br />See the Lifetime free logo chips replacement policies
B00L4TF32G|5|It's the best that I have seen of any protectants for leather and vinyls
B0093QIUYU|5|It looks great!
B000EDQR50|5|Exactly what I needed.
B00303XGRI|5|easy fix without buying the un-needed valve unit.
B0045WBVUM|4|Good products
B004YLKK5Q|5|Keeping my windshield washing to a reasonable level.  Hoping it will also deflect small rocks as well, after my first windshield was stoned.
B00BYNJ7HY|5|This is the cure for the dreaded death wobble.
B00CHD3ZPK|5|They fit, they work. No installation problems.
B00IGZQGAY|5|What's there to say, they're floors mats:) They fit and match the interior of my car perfectly.
B00MG687JW|5|To Buy this Product is a great deal pricewise, it is must for trucks and other big vehicles. Feature of flash light is very helpful at the night. It's compact nature make it more attractive.
B00FGKPSKQ|4|It was as said, but I didn't realize the sticky part was on the back.
B00M25PMNQ|4|For the money it is what it is! If you think your getting a plush suspension easy starting bike well I don't think so. My kid loves it and it runs its hard as hell to start but once it's running it runs good
B00LG07MZE|5|Great product. Not big enough for a Dodge Grand Caravan's windshield. About 6 inches short, but I bought two suction cup clips, used a little imagination, and clipped it into place in seconds. You clip one side, then go around and clip the other. There is enough flap to cover the windshield. With a little practice, I got it refolded and back in its storage case.
B008HRKJI6|5|Perfect!  Easy to program with the included instructions and works like the original one that was lost.  Buy it!!
B0059KLTR4|5|No bubbles.Great product.Love it.
B00F6AQUQC|5|Easy (although not quick) to install for an amateur. Great quality.
B00EPJDSAQ|5|Used these to replace some slim ballasts that just wouldn't come on right away.  Now I never have to worry about doing the on/off/on/off bit with the lights.  These really were worth the extra $.
B008YZGB7Y|4|I WISH THEY HAD HEAD MEASUREMENTS WITH THE DETAILS. OTHER THAN THAT THIS IS A GREAT PURCHASE.
B00JXLH7CG|5|[[VIDEOID:88b70cc55a1697572ec10117ddf12c4b]]Nice flasher, tested it with 9V Duracell battery and a \\"Blocklite\\" LED 6 light attachment that normally attaches to 9V battery, works just fine, this electronic flasher makes \\"ticking\\" sound when lights are flashing.    Instructions on how to connect this flasher independently on a moped to run from battery:  There are 2 metal prongs coming out of the flasher, one labeled \\"X\\" another labeled \\"L\\" there's also a black wire coming out of the flasher.  The \\"X\\" prong from flasher attaches to battery Positive (+) terminal, the \\"L\\" prong from the flasher attaches to the light switcher (when engaged switcher sends positive current to the light) the black wire on the flasher connects to the battery's negative terminal (-) and turn signal light ground wire also gets connected to the negative (-) terminal on the battery.
B008D8LZAA|4|Nice helmet but on the large side as far as mediums go. Medium was a little too big. Was afraid to exchange for small because I was worried it would be slightly too small.
B007FTV9Q8|4|I really like it a lot, It is a jumbo size but still needs to be a tad bigger
B011Q18D14|5|I am very satisfied with the shipping time and quality of product. The product is easy to use and the price is great.
B00ES9CACA|5|This item is perfect.. It works well and its $200 cheaper... I will write a fallow up if it goes out in a short period of time..
B00M1OUBES|5|Excellent... And Very High Tech.... That NICO Genius Boost jumped my neighbor's 40 Foot MotorHome vehicle.... NO PROBLEM.... FUTURE GADGETS ARE BEST... Thanks.
B00RD4D9AO|5|Perfect fit for car went in like it was a OEM part could not ask for better and great quality
B00VX8HE1G|4|Red isn't as rich as the description picture would lead you to believe (it's more orange-y), but the sticker is of good quality and seems to hold up well.
B00O39TPDM|5|fit perfectly, easy to install
B00GVV9AD0|5|Excellent color match, ended up looking very good!
B005KLVMEM|5|Great seller. Would repeat buy again.
B00397YNL8|5|I've been using Malco cleaner since I was a kid, my parents would pay me to clean their vehicles every weekend and always had it on hand.  I love this product, it cleans and treats leather and plastics extremely well.  You get a fresh/new leather look and feel instead of the greasy slipperiness that other products result in (armor all).
B00BOU0ZBY|5|I love lube locker gaskets,i'll never use RTV again on diffs, especially in a Rock Crawler rig where it seems you are always fixing and tweaking.
B00FWOKKGI|5|Great light off of this bar for sure, don't go to those lame off-road shops that try and charge you 300+ bucks for alight bar.
B006CV6FX2|4|I have had alot of great comments since I put it on. This product fit great, and is also pretty thick.
B001EOV4NS|5|Worked just like it should. No problem
B0020T17J2|4|you get what you pay for. Not much needs to be said about it, other than it works.<br />Use : 1985 Honda 200S atc rim
B00JVHLS3G|3|Little to big
B002UCACJK|5|It was just what was needed to hold the camper door open.  Works great!
B00XS4ZB4A|4|Product as described.
B00KGIE7KU|2|Ordered this part and bolted on my Honda 300ex.  Starter was probably used to start the machine 50 times, when it locked up.  Would not buy again.
B00EGWYH7A|4|It was not the right one but it work
B00ONGY3GY|5|Perfect!!!
B000C53XRK|5|Easy on getting the original off took some doing but i got it done
B001T6LKU8|5|just what I needed
B000H2W270|5|Nice antenna picked up people from far away pretty clearly out of the box but still want to get it tuned and it should be even better
B005XOZ29C|5|my mirror lost a fight between my husband and a weedwacker. The replacement came quickly and was very easy to install. It's lasted through a hot summer and a 1600 mile road trip.<br /><br />Will buy again if I need to, hopefully I won't need to, though.
B00DBH8W4K|5|Perfect fitment. Nice to have a place to rest my foot. :)
B00OAKGWNA|5|worked great
B00FBKJ2BW|1|I am so disappointed with this item. I though it was a completed remote. It's only the cover of the remote. The inside of the remote is not included.
B00F9VKX66|5|I have had good luck with the double platinum spark plugs. I guess the Iridium ones would last longer but after a couple of years it seems like a good idea to change your plugs anyway. We put these in along with a new K&N air filter and it seems to idle and accelerate smoother. I would recommend some anti-sieze lubricant on the threads for these long-life spark plugs. I've never heard of it hurting anything but I know breaking a plug off is a major pain. Thanks!
B006CRT72W|5|Works great. Easy to program.
B000TYTSPA|1|Don't work
B00W9G84Z6|5|If you don't have it in your life get one works on every car so far the things you need with is a lond 1 2 in extension and a 1 2 in ratchet highly recommend it ..
B00V75504S|1|It probably works fine but I should have researched more that the car needed to have the stock stereo in it for this to work.
B000C9OMTE|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B002P8OY52|5|as expected
B00GHT6SF4|5|Perfect fit
B00C0YQXYQ|5|Added a brass Tee so I could connect a  flexible air hose.<br /><br />Now I have a 5 gallon portable air tank .... that also works to seal tires to the rims.<br /><br />Remembered safety glasses, but forgot my ear protection.  I needed both.
B00M9NN0N0|5|The item seem to be of good quality the only thing is that it was worded as oil seals in the description and they only included one
B004SJSF1K|5|So far so good!  No noise and they stop well!
B00BZ3MSU6|5|Perfect fit. sturdy.  I was septical to see the mat folded in  two in the box but as soon as I install it it took it back his original  shape.
B001C4OB30|4|Very good I like it
B0002ILK4K|5|Item as described. Highly recommend
B002M496MK|4|not an exact fit, but close enough.
B008YFU3F0|4|Great item! My car looks very nice!
B001TNMJQK|5|A little short at the pin end, and looks small at the neck.  Very nice and heavy as is.
B0007Z9V4O|5|perfect fit!
B000BUQODG|5|Perfect replacement for my older vent covers.
B005BWIEB4|4|Look's like O.E.M. part,only problem was color.It is really brown,wanted saddle tan color.It beats the broken one on my daughters Camry.It will be fine for a 15 year old car.
B00924O1VE|2|No instruction manual cacame with it. Hard to install.
B00FB7YJZE|5|All the parts I needed came in the bag.
B004HMBK5G|3|OK
B00BSD9QQC|5|Great Hitch, Thank you
B0016ZNIAW|5|Goood
B00TPM7UTI|5|Fit perfect, works Great and is a whole lot cheaper than other marine starters.  I have an I/O Mercruiser 5.0, 2003 Monterey Montura.
B002P8WYRC|5|I have got two now excellent no troubles at all
B00TJBKUP6|5|Great product reasonable priced awesome that I could have find it than going to the dealer
B00BUMEIVE|5|Nice tank bag, would have fit better if I didn't have Heli-bars on.
B000AAMY86|5|I had purchased this to monitor my transmission temp in my Toyota FJ Cruiser since I am using it as a tow vehicle.  Works like a champ.
B00WW7DRPY|1|Is this a joke? Because if it is, it was done poorly. What am I talking about? In short, my hand is bigger than these reflectors for highway breakdown. If it's snowing and blowing, these reflectors wouldn't stand a snowballs chance in h***. But, the Google news is that my wife made a wind mobile out of them. When the solar charge is done, these items make a great glow in the dark mobile!!  I would highly suggest that the manufacturer rethink this item.
B00BD4PZKW|5|fits perfectly!
B000OCDYEI|5|good so far
B00CMOUXWW|5|Great Kit.  Surprised at the quality.  My brakes were not worn out, but the new pads and rotors are definitely an improvement.  Easy job which saved me over $500 from the shop price.  Take you time and be safe, and you should do fine.
B00AQBIICK|5|Fit perfectly
B00QYMY72A|1|broke on installation
B0091YV1F4|5|Highly Recommended!
B005XOYA7W|5|This was WAY more affordable than what the chain auto-parts store down the street wanted to charge me.  This is made sturdy and comes with adhesive pads and instructions.  This was so easy to do myself and I saved so much money.
B009XVBTN4|5|My rebuild kit was just what I needed it was correct part (dura) and am back in action!
B001BK062K|5|Thanks
B00XV4ZYLC|5|I love it .its fits great!
B001A5N128|5|Works well!
B000CMH9FA|3|It worked as expected
B000EQ833G|5|Hard to find glad I got for my ford aerostar more power with these plugs
B01173JG0S|5|Love it !!! Very lightweight , just what I wanted.
B00FC22Q4O|5|Great product hand down  super simple install.
B007Y5FI9M|5|Put sunshade during summer in the afternoon and make the car inside cool.  Make me relief when I am driving.  It is worth with it
B00C66ALNW|3|The mirrors work fine but the quality is cheap.
B00ET5P8PE|5|Beautiful radiator im  impressed..
B00747LXHQ|5|Easy to install and a quality product..<br />Looks great in my mustang!!
B0017LY2OQ|5|Great muffler. Stainless last longer than the plain type. 5-6 years in Wisconsin.
B00UNYLO26|5|Guaranteed to get your car vandalized in the Midwest!
B004MZKYLO|5|Shipped in a timely manner.  So far so good.
B00RBML85Q|5|thank you your product works great,, I am very pleased with your service and product
B00FYK0CD6|1|I bought 1 set. The left one worked and the right one went out in 3 days.. Not good
B001N41U1A|1|The product is made of thin flexible plastic. The fit was not that good. When you place items on top of it, the cargo tray would crease and sink indicating air space between the cargo tray and the cargo well. The lip will not hug the shape of the cargo well, it bends inwards on the long  sides and will get crushed when you stow the third row seats into the well.<br />The picture shown does not reflect the actual product.
B0016GXOXW|5|Great Product.
B00B1UYSA6|1|I didn't get the part I ordered from KIA
B002CMTIC0|5|Fits perfectly
B00HE6CI58|3|Not that bright...seems to be same as stock bulb. the hue is easier on the eyes thats all.  claims to replace de3022 but it is 1/4&#34; shorter than stock bulb...it still fit but barely sitting the prongs.
B012KZ5A3E|5|It's great
B0009TAOG2|5|Excellent product!
B0001XPCCC|5|I have put these frames on all of my vehicles that I have owned.  They're great and look sleek in my opinion. Especially when you are attempting to plastidip the badges on your car, or &#34;blacking out&#34; any chrome accents.  These really finish it up, especially with the bolt covers
B00VAGA19S|5|Good Very Good!
B00EKEGRVS|1|This device was ugly, it is not functional. It is not packed and had crashes...<br /><br />I had a buy very bad. The worst. I am unsastified.
B00CTG4TBO|5|As advertised.
B00G7GE6H4|5|The radiator fit the only disappointed it took to long to be delivered
B00PJPHEBO|5|Works great, no issues to date!
B00KOHHLTW|5|I bought a 2015 Street Glide Special and found out how wimpy the stock 103 is due to it coming from the factory already running lean. After the first thousand miles pulled the plugs to verify that. Sure enough plugs were already getting white.While in Sturgis this year I bought new slip ons, already had a K-N air filter, then seen just how lean it was on the way home, 1300 miles. Ordered a Vance and Hines FP3 tuner installed in ten minutes and bike now is what it should be! Easy to tune just use map for the pipes you have....done! Be for warned, V and H makes maps for their pipes and  generic slip ons. Can't say enough about this tuner! Forget HD and their maps this tuner will do any changes you make. My pipes are Freedom Exhaust 4.5 combat I used map for High output VH worked great. Torque curve is greatly improved, now I can run down to 1500 rpm in 6th and still pull without having to downshift! Very good product
B00C7Y83EC|5|gift, they said perfect fit
B003VASGOS|4|Great stuff!
B00I02BN88|1|Charged it for 2 days and no good. Did not work right out of the box. Returned for a refund.
B000CIQ5DG|5|I got it for the Weber 32/36 that I have on my FJ40 2F I get  a constant 5psig with. It is a bit noisy attached directly to the frame but that is easily drowned out by the rattles and road noise in my beasty. It's been on the rig for a while now and works great so far...
B0055R5TRC|5|stays on even in car wash
B00NON2332|4|Easy installation. Wish they were a little more durable but expected as they are universal fit.
B001EOV492|5|love it thank you
B0022ZWO0K|5|works as intended
B0006IX7Y2|5|This is a great supplement to your RV sewer hose system. Does what is supposed to do, allowing your waste tanks to properly drain (without manual manipulation of the hose) by providing a gradual downwards slope of the waste hose, from your RV to the waste drain hookup.
B001NBCKYO|5|used a bit ithis past winter.  I broke the fine heating wire - it was easily repaired with solder and sewing.
B0000AUSEW|5|These worked really well when we went camping! We were able to cook quite a few different things over the fire. My 6 1/2 year old had a lot of fun cooking her own food! It was long enough to ensure that we don't get burned and the wooden handles were comfortable to hold onto :-)
B000BOB3TW|1|Too large for my fuse box.
B000GTTWKE|4|Great cover! I have a Suzuki SV650S and the large cover fits nice. Even with heavy down pours the bike stays dry. Only complaint is the hooks are all metal, it would be nice if they had a coating on them in case they were to hit the bike while removing the cover. The hook for the middle of the bike is difficult to reach from the other side and I have to get on the ground to reach under my bike – it would be nice if it was adjustable but it does secure the cover nicely the way it is.
B0016LA5O8|5|Fits my CTEK Charger and works great.  Much easier than having to pop the hood to attach clips each time.
B00L4G91V8|4|I have had it over a year and seems to be holding on well although I think it is starting to weaken as sometimes the compressor isn't kicking in. Make sure you note wear the wires go as some are labeled with positive and some have a negative label on the capacitors.
B00A2IFP96|1|Giving this product a one star...not sure if it even deserves that. Cables were junk. Was not even a good shrink wrap that came in the kit. Had to use hear shrink I already had on hand. Clutch cable was not usable. Inner lining of cable was chewed. Clutch was stiff enough I could not fully disengage the clutch. In a nut shell...the throttle and idle cable were the only two parts of the kit that went on the bike. Save the headache by Barnett cables and lines.
B000GAOT88|5|Exactly what I wanted
B003CKJDW6|4|Worked well just what the battery needed
B00DHB09GE|5|Good quality. Fast shipping
B002ZTGLFC|5|as advertised
B0037NVKRO|5|Not very dark, but it's adequate. Doesn't scratch easily and is super simple to install.
B006NZTZLQ|1|I purchased this device based partly on the product description leading me to believe that it was worth the price difference between it and the cheap $15-30 models which based on some reviews I thought might be cheap knock-offs.  Unfortunately this device is basically the same and as such it is vastly overpriced.<br /><br />Don't let the software fool you, you can pick up a much cheaper Bluetooth OBD2 scanner and buy the comprehensive Torque app for $5.  This device offers nothing whatsoever over the cheaper models.<br /><br />Aside from being overpriced, I had difficulties using the device in 5 of 6 different vehicles.  I was able to connect with the computer in my 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee, but it would not communicate with the computer in my wife's 2008 Mitsubishi Outlander or my sister's 2003 Honda Pilot.  Other vehicles tried included a Ford Ranger, Nissan Pathfinder, and a Ford Escape.  The device regularly read and functioned in the Jeep, but nothing else it seems.<br /><br />I returned the device for a refund and will look to pick up a cheaper model and just use Torque with my phone/tablet.
B00BFYGZXG|4|My boyfriend liked his gift I expected it to be a little larger though.
B0006H8BEY|2|Mirror came with incorrect size bolts and did not come with hex bolts or locking bolts. I had to go out and buy longer ones, as well as their corresponding nuts.<br /><br />Once hooked up, lots of vibrations.  And mirror is horrible, reflection is skewed/distorted. And biggest problem? It is NOT a convex mirror, so field of vision is DANGEROUSLY POOR<br /><br />Thumbs way down
B002UC16F4|5|GREAT PRODUCT, SOLD BY FABULOUS SELLER AT A REALISTIC PRICE!
B00NAUKUNE|3|The red LED lights came in 2 x 5/8 that is the length times with, have not finished installing them do not know the brightness are loom quality, of  are as of the as this time.
B000Q753B8|2|This does nothing more than run an useless fan.  I've placed nearly frozen bottles of water into this unit, and placed it (plugged in) into the back of the car. While driving WITH the AC on; this unit still warmed up by the sunlight alone and we had room-temperature water after several hours of driving. The frustrating part was that I had this unit in and working, inside my air-conditioned car. But the summer sun alone was enough to defeat this unit. Meanwhile, the cheap $4 Styrofoam box sitting right next to it was keeping the (same) bottles of water nearly frozen hours later; no electricity required.  Don't waste your money.
B00HLV05DS|2|got this as a backup / loaner helmet and tried it out the last couple days.<br />pros: its very light, decent looking<br />cons: incredibly noisy at even relatively low speeds (25+ mph), no chin curtain, no breath guard<br /><br />fit was true to size, if not just slightly tight, but that is expected with new helmets before the pads form. there is a almost 'open' feel, like there arent enough pads, but still feels secure.
B004QEQIN4|5|Fast shipping low price worked out great.
B002IBRI9K|4|Not really white... Still a hint of yellow
B00M78820I|5|“ I received it the other day and it works just great replacing and old sun shade that had worn out. ”
B004GCAO5Y|2|The reason I got this was because my old bumper was being held up by zip ties. When I installed this one, the right side went into place. The left side (Driver side)  split open so, now it hangs down.  Such a disappointment. Wish they would quality check their product before shipping it. 2 stars, 1 because the right side locks in. 1 *Because it looks nice when it doesn't dangle.
B00QYEUSSA|5|Sturdy material, easy to follow instructions, and installation was less than an hour. Looks really nice on my Jeep and feel it will protect my a.c.condensor from rocks and other road debris. A pebble MAY get through, but, that would be about it. I feel a lot more comfortable going down roads, including gravel in traffic now.  I had a ford escape that we loved and a rock hit the condenser unit and cost us $800, so, what I paid for the grille is well worth the money.
B006VJH7Z0|4|Not quite a perfect fit,instructions are horrible
B00SBZRR8O|5|great
B0000AXQE8|4|Super hot water. Wow. Wish it was faster but it works good. Sometimes it trips fuse but not too often.
B00UXNVM74|3|This is cute- I 💜 all things Adventure Time!! Only thing is, I was under the impression this was gonna be black, like the picture shows, but when I got it it was white. My car is also white, so I couldn't place it where I had planned to cuz it wouldn't have showed up. Otherwise, I love it!
B00G9W9H2U|5|These are great for a plane if you want to bring a lot of clothes without checking luggage!
B00SH1SN6C|5|Tried it twice and works well.
B00E9D4NES|5|Excelente
