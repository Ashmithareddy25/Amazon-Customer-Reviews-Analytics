B004EF65QA|5|Our family has watched North and South about once a year for the last 3 years. It is still a favorite. Children, teens, and adults all stay to watch to the end.
B00FJ2YTLK|5|Great ending to a beautiful trilogy. Though there was heartache, anger, and shocking truths revealed, there couldn't have been a better way to end it. I'll miss reading about the lives of the Selected :-)

B00A6CCF0K|4|I bought this book with more than a little skepticism. I have been one of Mr. Kings, \\"Constant Readers\\", ever since I first discovered his work in the early eighties when a friend turned me on to, \\"The Stand\\". I was immediately hooked on his work and have read the vast majority of everything he has written. I have not always enjoyed everything Mr. King has done and his last two books I read, \\"Dumma Key\\" and \\"Under The Dome\\", really left me disappointed. Mr. King has always had a way of drawing me into the story and connecting with the characters. Knowing that this was the long awaited sequel to one of my favorites, \\"The Shining\\", I had to read it and see if he would disappoint me yet again. He did not. I loved the story. It had just the right touch of old and new to bring Danny alive and connect with me. Thank you Mr. King for letting us know what happened with Danny. I will always be one of your constant readers.
B000002JKA|5|Just read Dan's review. Best songs: The Mirror, Lie, Voices, Scarred.
B00005QZWI|5|Thanks for great response - great product - exact replacement for what had been stolen from us while on vacation!
0142428698|5|This is a very interesting and fun little book.  Theo is smitten with the law.  Both his paarents are lawyers.  He knows his way around the court house and knows many employees, including lawyers and judges.  They all know him.  Allhis school classmates come to him with problems.  Theo then gets involved with a murder investigation.  I will not divulge the rest.    Richard Thomas does a wonderful job as narrator.
1416523359|4|after reading all the negative reviews i felt it was necessary to give a positive one.  i loved this book, i read it in 2 days, so it is certainly possible that it is able to keep one's attention easily.  lisey and scott's story is incredibly poignant, the story of a life together with a little twist, brilliant.  people keep complaining about the language used in the book, come on, give me a break. it is not that hard to follow and the language is the key to the story, it makes it what it is and i loved it, it was one of my favorite things about this novel. i think people need to stop comparing this to other king books because clearly it is not the same.  i can understand why some die hard fans might be unable to digest lisey's story, but i think you have to appreciate it for what it is, it is not every other story he has ever written and frankly i think that is refreshing.<br /><br />so yes, if you find it challenging to read something a little more complex, not so straightforward, then maybe you should skip this.  but lisey's story is a great book and i think it is sad that just because it isn't the same predictable horror novel people are not giving it a chance.
B00E3BK0QQ|2|Easy to do and likely more for a teenager. Plus the free version is short and you can complete everything in no time. Maybe the pay for version is better, but I am a cheap skate and I know it.
B00K2G5ORQ|4|Wonderful and super inspiring read. Especially for someone who doesn't do much with her life :))
B0049VZ222|5|This is a very addicting series. Keeps you wanting to watch it all night long. Even though zombies are crazy to think of in the real world, this show makes it seem very real. Good acting and special effects.
B007J4T2G8|3|Eh, just got a bit dull.
0790738074|5|The movie version of The Music Man is quite a gem.  It stars the flawless performance of Robert Preston as Harold Hill and features the beautiful singing and intelligent acting of Shirley Jones.  One of the reasons that  this movie is quite a favorite of mine is because it is so faithful to the  script.  Many of the movie versions of the Broadway musical classics have  paled or have suffered in translation to the screen.   The movie version of  The Music Man is quite close to the original and contains a gem of a song  called &quot;Being in Love&quot;, which replaced the stage version's  &quot;My White Knight&quot;  (both songs are first rate).  The soundtrack  is also nicely done, even though &quot;It's You&quot; (sung by the Buffalo  Bills) seems to be missing.    The Music Man is a must for any movie  musical collection.
6300214710|5|Pretty in Pink is a 3 thumbs up movie. It's about an underprivileged girl named Andie Walsh. She is bright, beautiful, independent and really talented on the sewing machine (if you know what I mean)Her mother walked out on her and her father 3 years earlier, so this causes her dad to not be able to hold down a job. She's hassled at school by popular &quot;richies.&quot; Her best friend, Duckie, who's real name is &quot;Phil,&quot; secretly loves her. Her mentor is her boss at a small record store, Iona. Her life suddenly turns up when she's asked out by a rich romeo, Blane McDunnough. They're very happy until all of the richies force Blane to dump her while Duckie is mad at Andie. Now Andie, an underprivileged Cinderella, has to choose between two prom prince's, a rich guy of her dreams, or the person who dedicated his life to her. <br />   This movie has a happy ending and a genius plot that will bring tears to your eyes. I highly recommend this movie for everyone! Molly Ringwald did a stunning performance and really opened up the 80's eyes to what people who aren't rich go through in suburban america.
B000PAU032|5|Hans Zimmer is one of the most Beautiful Composers in the last decade and I am overwhelmed & delighted with his music.
B009EEL94Y|5|My nice loved
B00000IHE3|5|Can't say enough about this dynamic, sonic, audio gem. The material is every bit as good as \\"Brothers In Arms\\", and the recording quality is very close to that outstanding effort. Every song is imminently listenable and the lyrics are quite strong. The better your audio system, the better this material sounds played at volume.
B0006IIKS0|3|After watching a movie you really start to hate Lars. This movie is all about him. He shares his spotlight in the movie with James Hetfield, but overshadows James all the time. <br /> <br />If you'll be watching this movie, pay close attention to Kirk. He looks like he doesn't have any say in the band at all. But it looks like it doesn't really bother Kirk a whole lot. He just wants to play music, make money and enjoy himself. Now I really understand why Jason Newsted left Metallica. The movie does have some good parts in it with Jason, but they all get overshadowed again by Lars.  <br /> <br />You can tell that Lars always acts in front of camera. The rest of the guys do a good job of being natural on camera. Lars is doing a performance of a lifetime. You can really tell that he has a Napoleon Complex. Being short, that man is so insecure with himself that he constantly has to prove something to somebody and that leads to being not natural on camera.  <br />(By the way, I am not pounding Lars because of Napster. I totally support Metallica's actions against Napster) <br /> <br />James Hetfield on the other hand is shown as a very composed guy. It's definitely a new side of James that viewers learn from the film. I got nothing but positive vibe from James throughout the entire film. <br /> <br />But anyway, watch the movie. You'll enjoy it. I really don't understand why this documentary was chosen as a Sundance Selection. Being a huge fan of Metallica, I didn't find this film to be extremely good. It has its great and funny moments, but overall I give it 3 STARS. I liked \\"Metallica: Year and a Half Part I & II\\" a lot more. <br />
B003G4W49C|5|Enders Game represents one of the true classic works of science fiction.  It is a must read for anyone that claims to be a sic-fi fan.  I actually got this to reread as it was one of the genre shaping works from my childhood.  Surprisingly, all of the years between reading it as an eager sic-fi loving child and reading it as a jaded middle-aged man made no difference at all.  I was once again drawn into the story.  It was nice to be a child again and ironic given that Ender never go to be.
0440241413|1|As I have lately been enjoying the chick lit genre, I decided to give this book a try.  It sounded silly, but I figured if Kinsella was able to follow it up with several more Shopaholic books, she must be on to something.  I finished this book 2 weeks ago, and I'm still trying to figure out why, exactly, this book is such a hit.  I found Becky very hard to relate to.  Yes, like many 20something women, I've had credit card issues.  But Becky's pathological lying to her family, friends, and herself, wasn't amusing.  There were so many times in this book where I realized that a situation was supposed to be funny, but it instead just made me a little bit sick to my stomach.  I would have greatly enjoyed the fairy tale ending had it happened to any other character, but I couldn't root for Becky.  She didn't deserve it.
B00W6XM002|5|luv it
B00942X8PY|5|Very nice puzzle game.
0451239377|4|3.5 stars....<br />The day of the jackal was pretty entertaining! I liked it, didn't LOVE it, but I can fully appreciate why so many people rate it very high. (Especially men who like their guns :) I had trouble getting into it for the first 100+ pages. I also struggled with all the names of French places and character names as I have never been there or know much about France. And I also didn't like knowing the conclusion! But the last 150 pages was a fun cat and mouse game which was well written and quite exciting!
B005MLOKXA|5|One of the best lawyer shows that I have seen, Great writing/story lines, great actors and actresses, would definitely recommend. Need more shows like this one.  Glad it will be returning in the fall
B0049J3RBC|5|Cute and fun film.
6303314015|5|Disney had a doosy on their hands when they had to follow up the critcally acclaimed and Academy Award nominate &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; but the studio came through with shining colors.  The story line and plot seemlessly blends humor, sadness, hope, triumph, suspense, action and joy.  From the soul-stirring opening scene whe Simba is introduced at Pride Rock, to the race in the gorge to save simba from a raging stampede, to the finale where Simba and his fellow lions fight to save their kingdom.  To put it short, this movie is a masterpiece of animation and moviemaking in general and having Elton John write the music to the movie doesn't hurt at all.
B0000524CY|1|OK, I would say this is the worst movie ever, but Blade Runner, A Clockwork Orange and In The Name of the King have those titles.  There is no background for the old guy in the beginning.  We don't know why the demon selected this particular child.  The younger priest that first meets the possessed chick doesn't even try to do it himself first before bringing in the other guy (again, no real explanation).  The self sacrifice at the end is empty and really didn't have any value (they left nothing behind as far as we know).  The detective is a joke, provides absolutely no value to the story.  Only watch if you enjoy movies that provide absolutely no entertainment value.
B00HYTLY64|2|This movie was pretty boring. Robert Redford did a great job considering he was the only character and there was hardly any dialogue, but it was boring nonetheless. It was a good half hour too long.
B00VFTCGES|3|I like science fiction & action films, but this was a little too unbelievable.<br />A little hard to follow with multiple flashbacks & the time space continuum<br />All star cast
B005K17RU0|5|I have this appnand the weather channel app. I like this one best because all the info I want is on one page.
B0066W1AZK|5|this a very fun app, there are more games other chess! (checkers, tic-tac-toe, etc) I play it everyday! it's more awesome cause it's free!!!
0316055433|5|I purchased this book on a recommendation - this was a very good read I bought this for my husband
B00BLCHZC2|5|Love this show!!
B00005JL2O|5|I found this movie to be the best of the three austin power movies.  Almost non stop laughing.  This is just one of those movies you can't wait till christmas to get!<br />Some of the best characters are back, such as fat bastard, all of Dr. Evil's henchmen, Mini-Me, <br />And of course the movie follows the previous two in the \\"sequence\\".  What i mean by this is that there is a \\"shape\\" on the radar and everyone starts calling it diffrent names.  This is where the Osbournes make a appearance.  And of course some of the topics and planes that Dr. Evil comes up with are totally ironic and funny.<br />Mike Myers did an awsome job, and im quite sure you will enjoy this movie.<br />~hope this helps
B00KY7PEAA|5|This game is cool, I like it.  You can play it for hours and hours and hours, and then lots of time has gone by
B003EV6DBM|5|Any Doctor Who fan should have this in their collection.  It is a must have!  It is very well done!
B004ZJZQFG|5|I like this movie. I'm not usually into war films but this film was enjoyable. The quality of the product is great. I would recommend this product to anyone.
B00CL1SR7O|5|the dvd just came in today a day after my daughters birthday i had pre order it for her but i had to go out to bye one anyway so she has two of them so that makes her happy
0425252868|5|Great book, a must read
B00003CXDV|5|I hadn`t seen this film before I bought the DVD, not just because I bought  it only a few weeks after it was released here in Scotland, but also  because I read about it and thought it would be &quot;Dream Inducer&quot;.   But when I watched the DVD I thought the film was great.  I also like Star  Trek but even if I didn`t I think I would have enjoyed this film anyway.   Some of the humour was expertly placed and helped move the film along.  The  actors were great in the movie especially Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen  but most of all I like the Special Effects because before I watched the  film I didn`t know they used as much C.G as they did and it really was  fantastic especially the scene in the lift of the Spaceport when they first  see their ship, the NSEA Protector, that was superb effects.
B008469DGY|5|Fun and challenging game that really works great on my Kindle Fire. Don't get fustrated because it takes alot of tries to get 30,000 points!
B000002OVJ|5|Outstanding raw energy in this. Each musician gave a full-tilt display of really great musiciansip. The operatic style really enhanced it too. I saw this CD promoted a while & I finally bought it & boy, I'm glad I did!
B009G7ZYPY|5|This lady  has a voice made in heaven.  I buy her CD's for gifts and it gives me great pleasure to listen to her sing.  Again, this is what is so amazing and wonderful about AMERICA'S GOT TALENT.  These people have come out of their &#34;regular&#34; life and  taken the'<br />opportunity to be on this program and the long wait of coming back week after week, and &#34;uping&#34; their vocal offerings for our listening  pleasure and waiting for America to make a decision and vote.  Not only do they wait for us to decide, they first have to pass all the judges critiques to ever make it to our votes.  Miss Boyle is one of the most outstanding vocalist of our time!  If you haven't bought her CD wait no longer..............enjoy  Darlene
B000002897|5|ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER CREATED. ALONG WITH DUST THEIR SECOND ALBUM; THIS IS TRUELY ONE OF THE BEST BANDS OF ALL TIME. MUICALLY? GENIUS. MARK IS A FENOMINAL VOCALIST WITH HAUNTING VOCAL MELODIES AND A BAND THAT CREATES OUTSTANDING GROOVES TO BACK IT UP. SIMPLY AMAZING!

B00E8KLWB4|1|Sucked
B002MQYOFW|5|Started reading the book after seeing it recommended on Facebook.  Couldn't stop reading it 'til I finished all three books.  The characters are well-developed and the plot is the perfect combination of what we know now and what we can envision in the future.  As soon as I started reading, I knew this would be the perfect series for a movie.
1439177783|5|Unbearable Lightness follows Portia de Rossi on an emotional journey through bulimia and anorexia from beginning to end. Starting from childhood and a modeling job she was sure she talked her way into, and ending with the fairy tale romance we see from her and Ellen today. Portia spent most of her life feeling like she didn't deserve anything that came her way This was partially because she was gay, and because she couldn't change that, she controlled the one thing she could: her weight. She lived two lives, one in front of the cameras where she was a single straight female on a hit TV series. Another, a closeted gay woman obsessed with food portions and working out. She lived a sick sad life of self abuse and loneliness until she was able to confront her family and herself with the reality of her illness and her lifestyle.<br /><br />I am absolutely in love with this book and with Portia. Before reading this book I too have struggled with my weight. It's funny because she says something to the effect of: No matter how much I diet or workout I always end up right back at 130. This ended up being her \\"natural weight\\", something I had heard of a person having but I always struggled with finding or knowing mine. I had tried everything from fad diets to not eating until 5pm, and I always remained at 130. Food was an obsession, and I would obsess over what was in my cabinets until I allowed myself to eat them. I would binge, but unlike Portia, I never purged. Since reading this compelling story I have ended my battle with food. I enjoy what I want when I want. I never considered myself to have an eating disorder, but I definitely spend way too much time thinking about eating. Since reading this book I have ended that cycle of thoughts. I related a lot to Portia when she would tell herself that she didn't deserve things because she was fat or disgusting and there were even times when I was jealous of her control when she only ate a small amount of calories a day. I actually felt motivated by her sense of urgency towards working out and almost wondered if this book was going to be a tool towards me being worse with food then better. However, when I reached the final pages of the book I felt freedom from food because she felt freedom from food. It was such an emotional journey, one that I flew through with her, and by the end it just made sense to stop fighting with food and to just let go. That was three months ago. Since then I have not gained a pound. I do not binge, and I am no longer hating myself after I eat a meal. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever battled with food, and to everyone else who hasn't.motivated by her sense of urgency towards working out and almost wondered if this book was going to be a tool towards me being worse with food then better.

B001KQZ7I8|5|Superlatives are inadequate to describe the power and relevance of this small book. Framed in a specific historical reference(The Holocaust), that we all know well, still the significance of human experience, suffering and endurance is deeply accessible to me, here and now in this reality of 21st century catastrophic climate, cultural and geo-political conflicts and swaths of soul-numbing entitlements . . . where we still hunger for meaning.
B004LROMWU|4|Best season.
B008JFUQ3O|5|I went to see this one with my grandson and we both loved it.  It was the only thing he asked me for for Christmas.
1849904251|5|Fantastic addition to anyone's Sherlock collection. Great tidbits of each episode and their characters. Enjoyed the snippits of insight from the creators. Would like more from them in the next series book. Their process merging the past and present is always interesting.
B00IFOOPM2|3|Has it's issues but I loved every messy minute.
1556154844|5|McConnell has read years and years worth of computer science literature and distilled it into an extremely readable format. It is a hefty 800+ pages but you will rip through it and enjoy every minute. McConnell combines wit and valuable information into a gem of a technical book. If  you program and you haven't read this book you are doing yourself a great  disservice. McConnell also goes to great lengths to avoid dogma. He  presents many sides to what sometimes seem like religous issues in  programming. He gives you the information to make your own decisions. Trust  me, you MUST read this book.
0380789019|5|It takes you to an entirely different world, it's a darker type of world but it's amazing. Neil Gaiman is an excellent writer and gives just enough detail to get a picture but let's you fill in a few details of your own. His style of writing is definately unique and it's a nice change of pace. It's just like the cover reads &quot;A dark contemporary Alice in Wonderland&quot;.<br />I also read Stardust and will read anything else he puts out, great work :)
B0071XO8RA|5|We need more Wool stories, the futures of Silos 17 & 18 and other Silos. Please Hugh, I want more!  I've just purchased Shift and Dust, what more can I say.

B00003003R|5|Guns n' Roses can do no wrong and the world is not the same without them!
B005USZYDU|4|A well written, swiftly paced mini thriller that is reasonably believable. A bit like a Bobsey Twins tales of many years ago.
B00BLCHZC2|5|One of the most realistic shows with a Historic background that not only educates you about a people that braved the Seas. Exploring so much of the World.
B0037YOMWS|5|the best calculation I have never meet before! delivery is on time and quality is perfect ,so recommended!! the using function is clear and easy ,very useful for financial workers.
B0040I09RM|5|Highly addictive!!!!
B005O7PXNS|5|YES!!!
B000VDDDVO|5|Amazing movie! Part of our yearly Christmas movie lineup!
0802473156|5|I love this book. It is so easy to read and understand. Makes sense and offers great advice that you really utilize in your relationship. Highly recommended
0061002860|3|This struck me as almost a Christie pastiche; the number of (perfectly-timed) secret liaisons in the gazebo, secret engagements, secret marriages, poisoners, blackmailers, murders, suicide, unacknowledged children, torn scraps of cloth and so on per captia seems high even for Dame Agatha. Still, a fun read.<br />Maybe because I'd heard about how shocking and controversial the ending is, I twigged who the murderer was by about chapter four. Still, it was fun to watch the buildup and conclusion, and we get a fresh (although quite Hastings-like) view of Poirot. Three stars, but then I'm a hard grader! *8)
B005NQ94KS|3|And boring. It jumped around so much that I never did feel a connection with the characters or the plot. After the \\"climax\\" the movie still kept moving along through 2 or 3 more years. Ugh.
0143038419|5|This book was a great suggestion; received it very quickly; I am more than very satisfied.
B00A9C3RB8|5|Hope Springs, I loved this movie, parts of it reminded me of my own marriage of 31 going on 32 years and how we grow apart over the years or really just become different people and then need to find why we really are in the marriage and try to get some of the reasons back we started the union to begin with. It made me laugh and cry. I would recommend this to family and friends.
B00L9B7IKE|5|It was absolutely riveting
B004GJDQT8|5|Good
B00992CF6W|5|Many different objects and blocks to interact with. You can choose creative, which is an unlimited number of all types of blocks, or survival which is a mode where you have to dig underground, chop down trees, or hunt for different objects. In survival, there is also zombies, skeletons, spiders, and creeper that have different abilities to try to kill you. You can also die from drowning, falling from tall places or starving. Creative mode is better for children 3 - 7. Survival is better for kids 8 and up, but it's your choice which way you play. The only off-side is that the game takes longer to get updates on Amazon devices. I hope this review was helpful. :)
0316166685|4|This was a really good read...up until the end...which I WILL NOT SPOIL for anyone.<br />There are two things the writer could've (should've) done that would have made<br />this book excellent. I don't regret buying it though and I encourage others<br />to do so too. I still can't get over the ending though...
B001H4NXCK|5|Awesome movie. Cast are great in it.
B004SRPXWQ|5|Ok I was putting my kindle next to the speaker of my Tv then Tom started to repeat what the characters in CHOWDER are saying
B0059XTTW8|5|For any moviegoer who can sit still, and absorb intelligent dialogue along with a suspenseful storyline --- this film is for you.  There's a stellar cast -- and brilliant acting.  Sorry, no explosions or superheros -- well maybe one superhero -- George Smiley.
0800177363|5|1.  Others have well documented what this movie is about etc...<br /><br />2.  I just wanted to add my 2 cents that this is an extraordinary movie on all fronts; completely amazing.  Get it, watch it and be inspired.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|Best game ever<br />😉
B0098VYKSA|4|I enjoyed this version much more than Mirror, Mirror. I think that Charlize Theron is amazing and her portrayal of the evil queen is wonderful. Definitely could have a sequel..
B00JOT3HQ2|4|Omg so fun
B009HUB40Y|1|I just wanted to play the game and see how I could do.  Each time I would finish a game, it would ask if I wanted to connect to facebook and notify my friends of my score - well no, I didn't so I delete it!
B0064W65SO|5|I definitely enjoyed this book for the second time around and I highly recommend more people to read it. Great Read!!!
B0091REZMW|5|Great game.Highley recommended.
B0020BUWX2|5|Amazing. Phenomenal. Beautiful. Suspenseful. Amazing. A must read. Romantic. Tragic. Bitter sweet. Perfect. Beautifully written. Like no other. Sweet. A book I will 're read again and again.
B00EVW0SA0|5|Great combination of action with a bit of humor thrown in! Loved the interactions between Tatum and Foxx...not to mention Channing was easy to watch.
B009C7ZQM4|5|Nice very nice
B008I34ZFW|4|I really enjoyed this film it was a little campy, but it told the story very well. I think everyone should watch it.
B00F87ZUYG|5|Great show. Even greater episode. Not to spoil anything, but this one was on the slower side. Haven't decided if that's a bad thing yet. Just something I noticed. I'm sure they'll tie everything in next episode.
B00CNQ7HAU|3|The story was an enjoyable read but very predictable.  The outcome was somewhat disappointing because it was not deserving and was presented as an easy way to end the book.
B00HV8TN7K|5|Good
B00B2V66VS|3|I like the app but it keeps crashing on my kindle. the app is way better than the first other than that one aspect. I do encourage buying this game but I'm tired of reinstalling it. Please fix this Imangi Studios :)
B00KTDD69A|2|I enjoyed playing this game for about ten minutes, and then to move on I was asked to buy the complete game, which was $4.99.  As the game is not that exciting or interesting, I opted not to do so.  I have much better games that were either free or $1.99.
B00005JL0I|4|I know that this is the original casino royale but I really prefer the newer one with Daniel Craig in it.
B004JN1CW4|5|I enjoyed the whole experience throughout the series. The book was written as though it took the reader with for the adventure and that is what reading is all about.
B000002N2P|5|What on earth's wrong with you guys? This album is great and sooo underrated! I love Walking Contradiction and I used to hate Geek Stink Breath but now I've heard it a couple of times I love it and the title's quite witty. I love the video for walking contradiction. And I'm sure the other songs are just as good. I was wrong about Greenday being rubbish! What a stupid thing to think! Silly me! But it is just one of ten fantastic albums! Listen to this, they'll be one of the greatest bands in history! <br />
0446613444|5|It is my first book of Harry Bosh' series (but I've read other books by Michael Conelly that I liked) and I was impressed. There are many novels with the motif of 'lone wolf' but it is difficult to make the reader really like the main hero. This book is the one. The plot seems totally logical and realistic, and at the ame time intriguing until the end. Mexican background, including Harry' adventures there, seems real and interesting. The police work in LA is described with such details that you definetely get the atmosphere the writer tried to convey. Definitely recommended to all fans of mistery novels and police thrillers.
B009VB97EY|5|I thought that this movie was great. Channing Tatum did a great job, I didn't know he could move like that.
0553106635|5|I have been so bowled over by this book - and its two predecessors - that I can scarcely find the words to describe them.  Yes, they are dark and grim, but also filled with fascinating characters and a gripping story.  I can hardly wait for the next one - and it has been years since I've felt that way about any novel in this genre.  George R.R. Martin has set new standards for fantasy novels - and any other type of fiction, for that matter.
B00M7URUUE|1|Seemz like it needed more production and sea effects
B009EBLCK8|5|I am hooked! This is such a good take on the classic black and white TV shows but with a wonderful modern cutting edge; can't wait for the next season to begin.
B00VFTAXUC|5|Awesome Movie

B0038P80CO|3|Christian Alvart’s Pandorum is a typical science fiction thriller on the surface; however, upon closer review, it reveals a myriad of evolutionary themes. The film follows the flight crew (Dennis Quaid, Ben Foster) on a Noah’s Ark themed ship, which we learn has departed from an overpopulated Earth with an “ideal” population sample to restart life on a new habitable planet. The trip is supposed to take 123 years, so the pilots must take shifts where the off duty officers are in “hyper sleep” along with the other passengers. When the protagonists awake to discover something has gone awry, they encounter a new cannibalism practicing - human-like species that has taken over the ship.<br /><br />Though this film does not need to be viewed with a critical eye to be enjoyed, one can uncover the aforementioned ideas. A culturally appropriate depiction of overpopulation connects to the contemporary ideas of depleting resources. Next, eugenics and artificial selection are featured prominently through the choice of humans determined to be the only hope of a future for the race. What Pandorum lacks in character depth, it greatly compensates for in these areas and I highly recommend it to any fan of the genre.
B00M7UTFW0|2|Spoiler so don't read This was very strange take on the Noah's Ark story and a little to far out for me. Noah was a lunatic and madman in this movie thinking he had to rid the world of all people except his immediate family but when there is an unexpected pregnancy he threatens to kill the children to make sure there are no further people to ruin the earth.
B007FG9LIE|4|I read the trilogy in two days. Awesome read.
B00M1SRCAA|5|So good that the 1st time I listened I had to listen again.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Mark Watney is a hero for the ages. He's intelligent and humble, fallible and funny. The science in the book is fascinating, Watney's plight even more so, and in Weir's very capable hands it's a book that you won't be able to put down. Enjoy!
B000XUBFE2|5|I loved this book.  It truly touches the human heart and spirit.  I couldn't put it down.  This is a must read.
B00A1XOPE8|4|I really enjoyed this short story. It was truly an amazing work and I'm planning on reading it again soon. I recommend this read.
B00020HEG6|5|Amazing how John Williams comes up with all this new material for old characters . . . one of the best scores ever. Go get it, if you don't have it already! You won't regret it!!! <br /> <br />
B00HYTLY64|1|Need something to help you fall asleep? This is for you! This movie had next to no plot; it could have easily been a short.<br /><br />Spoiler: boat gets a hole. Boat slowly leaks.<br /><br />That's it, that's the whole movie. To help keep the excitement going, there is next to no dialog, so it's painful to watch in addition to boring.
1400031001|5|Written in diary form, this novel describes the life and times of Logan Gonzago Mountstuart, born in 1906 in Montevideo to an English father and his Uruguayan wife, who later moves with his family to England just before the First World War, and takes the reader from the 1920s to the 1990s.<br /><br />This is an incredible, thoroughly engaging novel which gives the reader entree into the ups and downs, the fullness of a man's life who travelled widely and knew many of the literary, social and artistic notables of the century (e.g. Picasso, Virginia Wolff, Hemingway, and Jackson Pollack). I enjoyed this book so much I almost hated for it to end!
B00GX50ZC4|1|It's the exact lifeless retelling you would expect. Kutcher is not even humorously bad as Jobs, just occasionally funny. Not worth a rental.
1419705644|5|Been waiting for this for a long time and its soooooooo cool. I wish other shows would do this. It's super funny and if your a hardcore fan you'll LOVE it. Not an art book or story board book, but a weird encyclopedia with stuff for the fans. For the price its great.
B00A8ECU24|3|My toddler loves it. It keeps her busy for a while. I would recommend it for any parent to try. I don't like it as much
B002DOSBMK|5|This book was recommended to me.  It is an easy read.  I love it when you can slip right into the story, in a fantasy story and everything seems so real!  That's a mark of a good writer.  Enjoyed the story, the characters and Drizzt's desire to persevere despite his circumstances and family.  I am already more than half-way through the third book in the series and the author continues to satisfy the reader.  Readers of young adult fiction fantasy will definitely enjoy this series!
B00FAPF5U0|4|I got sucked into this game by my niece. I'm stuck at level 245 but I'm still trying! Some levels can seem impossible!
B00ILHW6AG|5|It's a quick read and I had troubles putting it down at night. Became quickly immersed in this book and loved all the characters.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Why pay for HBO when you can get movies for free.  I know nothing about electronics but this was easy to install and my cell phone is my remote. I love this product because I have no wires hanging from my TV.
B007ZGO7EM|5|I've tried many calculator apps. This is by far the best calculator app free or paid for. Everything is clear and straight forward. The graphics are sharp. Great job developers!
B000VDDDVO|5|I previously had a VCR of this movies...but time goes on and VCR technology is<br />no longer practical.  The color version does have several black spots of perhaps 1-2<br />seconds.  Somewhat annoying but beats the vcr by a long shot.
B00P42WROG|4|Good, but less than I expected. I like the new genre with the detective work, rather than the horror, however I liked Mr. Mercedes better. That being said, I think Stephen King is an extraordinary writer.
0064431789|5|Classic
B0012QVJXS|5|Good
B002SJIO4A|5|This is a good movie and the disc was in excellent condition, this is a movie that is easy to get into and watch all the way to the end!

B005IS564E|5|I remember everything!!<br />This album lives up to War is the Answer. I only buy vinyl of the albums I truly want to listen to all the way through and this one delivers.
B001BANK32|4|I'll be the first to admit I'm not a fan of horror. That being said with such a literary classic as The Shining is, I decided to take a peek. Filled with flaws characters and suspense Stephen King does a tremendous job bringing into this world he's created. You truly see the evolution into madness that Jack has throughout the story. It wasn't as based into horror as I thought it was, and actually tells a superb story. I'd gladly recommend this book as it was a worthwhile read.
B00DUGCLY4|5|its really fun like you can play with your facebook friends<br />but you have to coins are hard to get and hints are expensive
0385504209|4|I just recently saw \\"The Adoration of the Magi\\" in the Uffizi in Florence, so this book really resonates for me.  It makes me want to go back and take a fresh look at Botticelli's art, at the Mona Lisa, medieval architecture, and the Bible.  I rarely put much credence in elaborately constructed conspiracies, but there is much to fascinate in this novel.  The only people I've ever known who were Masons, Rosicrucians, members of various Catholic subcultures, and so forth always struck me as supremely silly people with too much time on their hands.  Maybe I ought to take a closer look at them too!
0805095152|5|This is an excellent, very important book.  The shipper was prompt in sending this book off.  The USPS was very slow.
B00992CF6W|1|My kids love this game.  They play non-stop.  I'm a bad parent, I know.  But with the latest update, 0.9.1, which I updated yesterday, they cannot connect/join worlds.  It also seems to crash more often.  Which means they come to me to complain about the game.  What?  I have to have interaction with my children?  This update is ruin my life!!! (please don't take the bad parenting jokes too seriously.)
B007UQ5Z1G|5|\\"Living Things\\" by Linkin Park contains music that creatively embodies emotional vulnerability and resilience.  It is completely different from any of their other albums, but this change really fits with the \\"Living Things\\" title of the cd. For example, \\"Castle Of Glass\\" brilliantly touches on how tragically it is human nature for many to judge others from the metaphor of \\"glass houses\\".  \\"Lost In The Echo\\",\\"Victimized\\", \\"Roads Untraveled\\", \\"Skin To Bone\\" and \\"Tinfoil\\" are some of the compelling songs that touch a chord on the transformation that challenges can bring. \\"Living Things\\" by Linkin Park is a good selection for those who like electronica and rock and/or at least two Linkin Park albums.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|I cannot wait for the next chapter.  The room is a breath of fresh air in a world of puzzles.
B000P6YNSE|5|LOST is a show on high octane.  Once you get on this ride, you won't be getting off.  You'll be addicted as all of us fans are.<br /><br />Even if this season was not my favorite.  Even if we were given little answers and only more questions...I couldn't stop watching.  I guess I am invested in the story and the characters.  Every night it's on, I'm there in front of the TV and the next morning I'm discussing it with a friend.  LOST is the most original show out there.  By far.<br /><br />If you haven't gotten on the LOST bandwagon- do so before you miss out!!  I doubt you'll be disappointed.
0810993139|5|This is better than the third wheel book.  I would definitely recommend this book to other kids around 7 years old, and around the globe.  Other kids would love this book.  It was hilarious the whole time I read it.
B00631VJIC|4|I love the sons but was a little disappointed in the sound track. I still like the music, was just hoping for some songs i guess didn't make the cut.
B009ZE27US|1|My wife downloaded this on a whim. It was deleted within 10 minutes of download. I'm unsure why this app or one's like it even exist. This app has almost zero entertainment value; almost zero because I'm generously including the ~10 sec of laughter that my wife and I shared over just how stupid this app was because I went from being 18, then 45, then 70...
B0026S93C0|5|This movie is so romantic! I love its music and the story of success and how she overcame her fears.
B00BD99JMW|5|Insurgent was an excellent book. It is always sad to finish a good series, but I could not have expected more. I will always love this series.<br />  -Jon
B0000029DD|5|Jeff Buckley belongs to a very small sliver of artists that are gifted enough to produce a breathtakingly beautiful piece of music on the first take.  This music soars on its own merits, and not by virtue of his death  alone.  I picked this up almost a year ago after hearing 'Last Goodbye' and  without a doubt it is one of the best CDs I have heard to date. Usually  with one's favorite CDs, they rarely leave the stereo, but there is a  subcategory of favorites that you can only pull out every now and then  because they are so good they consume you.  This is the kind of music that  requires you to sit down and be possessed.  As such, I won't undermine the  scope of the CD by bestowing favor on any particular track; instead I urge  you to listen to the entire thing and see for yourself.
B00A822VDY|5|My 3 year old loves the movie. Comedy is good for most ages. Great that the Blue Ray version comes with te dvd as well.
B00M4ADWTK|5|Another &#34;spin on a classic tale&#34; movie, but well executed and thoroughly enjoyable.
0783225482|5|This is a great movie with rich colors and sound with beauty and humor. Goldie Hawn, Meryl Streep, and Isabella Rossellini are stunningly gorgeous in this movie!
B004QZ9PLU|5|Incredible. Simply incredible.
B00ARA4SLU|4|An unusual film \\"Hitchcock\\" is a bit of biography, a bit of a \\"making of\\" and quite a bit of fiction surrounding the Hitchcock's classic 1960 film \\"Psycho\\". If taken with a grain of salt, \\"Hitchcock\\" is an enjoyable mixture of fact and fiction that hinges on the performances of Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife (and uncredited collaborator) Alma and Danny Huston as Whitfield Cook a writer who worked with the Hitch's during the 1940's. All three give great performances and Hopkins focuses less on imitating Hitchcock and more on developing his character as he begins to see serial killer Ed Gein while preparing and shooting \\"Psycho\\".<br /><br />The introduction of an affair that Alma may or may not have had with Cook (those events supposedly occurred in the late early 50's nearly a decade before \\"Psycho\\" as Cook was working on \\"Strage Fright\\" and \\"Strangers on a Train\\"). According to Hitchcock biographer Patrick McGillian Cook may have been gay (based on information obtained from his journals--Cook reportedly was involved with Sumner Elliot much later in life).<br /><br />Even if \\"Hitchcock\\" is far from factual, it manages to be an enjoyable romp.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a top notch transfer from Fox. Colors pop and detail is extremely sharp.<br /><br />The audio is quite good as well and is provided in English, Spanish, French with subtitles in English and Spanish<br /><br />Fans who pick this up for the DVD should be aware that none of the special features are included on the DVD included in the Blu-ray combo pack.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has some nice special features including: a deleted Scene, a variety of featurettes focusing on \\"Hitch and Alma\\", Danny Elfman (who provides a very good score that compliments the Herrmann bits and pieces included from \\"Psyho\\")as well as featurettes that focus on the cast and director Sacha Gervasi's decision to make the film.<br /><br />The most informative extra is the commentary by director Gervasi with author Stephen Rebello who's book on the making of \\"Psycho\\" provided the basis for this fictionalized account on the making of the film.<br /><br />While not exactly 100% factual, \\"Hitchcock\\" isn't unlike other Hollywood biographies in how it takes liberties with the facts to create a good drama. As long as you keep in mind that this isn't like a documentary on Hitch and the making of \\"Psycho\\" you can enjoy the film.Gervasi with author Stephen Rebello who's book on the making of \\"Psycho\\" provided the basis for this fictionalized account on the making of the film.<br /><br />While not exactly 100% factual, \\"Hitchcock\\" isn't unlike other Hollywood biographies in how it takes liberties with the facts to create a good drama.

It's complete with great pictures to inspire you, plus tips for just about everything you could ever want to do in your home.<br /><br />This is a book you always see in Anthropologie and they WAY overcharge. So glad i got mine on Amazon.
B00FI7XBIS|5|I downloaded this game on Halloween and it really filled my holiday spirit since I don't trick-or-treat. Even after the holiday, I'm still engaged in this game.

B000002H70|5|When one thinks of an apt representation of the 80's, The Cure certainly comes to mind.  In &quot;Disintegration,&quot; this topic is handled on both a micro- and macro-scopic level.  Released in '89, songs such as  &quot;Closedown,&quot; &quot;The Same Deep Water as You,&quot; and  &quot;Disintegration,&quot; symbolically represent both an era and a part  of The Cure (especially Robert) coming to an end.  Ultimately, it is an  album of hope, with Robert realizing in &quot;Prayers for Rain&quot; the  certainty of rebirth.
074356619X|4|OK
B00UENHBAU|5|Amazing and its harder than the 1 and 2 just amazing
B004FYH2MQ|5|Wonderful surprise for the whole family!
B00R2LTNL2|3|So, As much as I hate to say this, The Hobbit Battle of five armies  felt too drawn out, and dare I say, too long. the effects were as usual, brilliant, but the entire movie could and arguably should have been wrapped up without dragging it out into an entire new second half of the ending. It was truly good, and if you've watched the others, then you have to watch this to feel complete in Mr. Jackson's world of Middle Earth, but he went a bit off course overall in his Hobbit series , adding things that weren't even in the book, and also subtracting other elements that should have been included. Fun though, overall, as long as you like protracted battle scenes.....
B005LAII44|4|Not as good as the first one, but theres alot of action, cant wait for the third movie to come out
0439796636|5|wonderful book
014050639X|3|I remember when this book was really popular, but then, as now, I don't know why. Story's kinda dull and the illustrations are just so-so. A disappointment for me from one of my favorite authors x 2 -the Ahlbergs
0345457692|4|I had to take away one star from a story that should have been five.  The sci-fi part was awesome! The action and ideas are second to none and kept me reading. It's been a while since I picked up a book that was difficult to put down...then.    I have a teenage daughter and pre-teen son who both like reading my books but because a couple sex scenes are thrown in, for no real reason, I will be taking this book to a used book sale so my children won't see it. Really, I don't have an issue with someone trying to write a steamy story but it was hardly provocative and it did nothing for the story but make me skip over paragraphs.    The story would have stood on it's own and would have been a five. I'm sure the ones who get magazines to read sordid affairs will like those two stories, but it wasn't as good as the author thought.    I hope the only 'hardcore' in the next book (I'll give Morgan one more shot) is just some good 'ol hardcore sci-fi.
B00DUGCLY4|4|I welcome a game that works the adult mind
B000M341QE|2|This won Best Picture?! Did no one see The Queen, Dream Girls, or even Little Miss Sunshine? This movie was filled with cliches and retreads of every other mobster film. The only thing saving this is Leonardo's and Matt's performance.
0307592731|4|Have to admit that I have always found great peace while walking, many amazing things happen when you turn down the noise and turn inside to your God center.  This book clearly illustrates that when you drop all the glitz and glitter and noise that surrounds your everyday life, you can find who you truly are.

0764169742|5|I have read it cover to cover and refer to it often. It helps you to look at plants in a new way.
0064400557|5|I don't see why the other review writers didn't like this book.It's great,fantastic,and a must read.I would give the maximum number of stars,no matter how many stars allowed.But there is only 5.It deserves more than 100.More than 1,000.More than 1,000,000! Unlimited! But the endings for these E.B White books are a little sad (especially the one for Stuart Little,see my review on it.)But the good drowns out the sadness.Better than Stuart Little.In fact,I have to say that this is the best of all three books.I also wish there was a fourth book,like there is to Harry Potter,C.S Lewis,and Roald Dahl.The E.B White books rock the world of books!

B002PEP4SC|4|Richard Castle is a fictional writer of crime fiction, one half (the literary half) of the sleuthing team of Becket and Castle on ABC TV's comedy-drama police procedural [[ASIN:B001XRLWPQ Castle]]. Castle is the \\"real life\\" author of these books. Who actually writes them is thus far a bigger mystery than a season's worth of CASTLE scripts.<br /><br />While lots of movies get book tie-ins, this is the first time a TV character has spawned a book series. (Disclaimer: BONES' Temperance Brennan was invented by author Kathy Reichs, and on the TV show Brennan writes novels in which Kathy Reichs is the heroine, but the BONES books inspired the show, not the other way around as with CASTLE.)<br /><br />You don't need to be a CASTLE fan to enjoy HEAT WAVE (though it doesn't hurt). Nikki Heat is the sexy, no-nonsense cop. Jameson Rook is her wisecracking sidekick.<br /><br />In HEAT WAVE they are investigating the murder of a New York real estate tycoon who fell on both hard times and the pavement of Central Park West (from the sixth floor of his apartment building). The story stands on its own as a good, light quick murder mystery, leavened with humor.<br /><br />The in-joke of Richard Castle having written the book (and having based the suave, attractive, intelligent and heroic Rook on himself) keeps bursting through the fourth wall to add a unique and entertaining dimension to HEAT WAVE. If you've never seen CASTLE, you will watch it after reading HEAT WAVE. And if you weren't aware that Castle's HEAT WAVE is a real book, then be in for a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Personally, I can't wait for NAKED HEAT to be released!

You can see right through the disc too.  But mostly, there are two bridge scenes where everyone seems to have one side of their faces 20 shades darker than the other.  Looks muddy.

B00LZWV8JO|4|At first it didn't seem this novel was quite up to Mr. Stephenson's other works.  But once I got used again to his somewhat verbose writing style, it improved.  And I certainly liked the fact that it wasn't a totally dystopian view, of which we already have far too much in science fiction.
B00EQ30RVY|3|Decent stuff

B004BSFSTA|4|I have been searching for some over-the-ear head phones and read reviews on MANY headphone them came across these marshals both from amazon and cnet. After reviewing positive reviews for the $100 range I decided to buy them. NO REGRETS! I love a wide variety of music and it sounds great on all! Have owned these For a couple months now and still in great condition! Sound is impeccable but I only gave it 4 stars because of the comfort level after several hours of wearing the headphones. the headphones are a great snug fit over your ears but after several hours of having them over your ears, soreness develops. I travel a lot and spend many hours on the road so I have these on hours at a time. I'm not sure if they will wear in after a while but it's snug fit can get to you. I have to give em a rest after long use but I still highly recommend these headphones!

B000HIVQBC|5|With this release DM finally became the truly sleazy sweaty rock band they always secretly desired to be (or at least frontman Dave Gahan did). For the followers of DM through their career this album certinaly came as a shock - it certainly did to me. But when you work through the initial resistance this album shows itself to be a truly memorable achievement. Whilst Violator saw DM master their skills and cement their position as the masters of electronic rock, this recording showed them pushing the envelope. From I Feel You's screeching guitars and pulsating energy (check out the Afghan Swamp Surgery mix on Maxi CD for a super treatment of this song!) to the stripped back Condemnation Depeche Mode moved into areas no one would have thought. Apparently recorded under extremely tense conditions with addictions and works stresses - the tensions seem to emanate from the album. The production on a DM album has never been so good and Alan Wilder's departure is sorely missed. This album clearly showed the manic obsession the guy applied to all DM productions. Every track is different and every track shows a different side to the band from the classic synth warmth of songs such as Walking in My Shoes and Higher Love to the electro frenzy of Rush and then to the soulful Get Right With Me and the super sexy In Your Room. This album shimmers, rocks, grinds and crunches. As a long time fan and owner of all their CDs - this is the CD I always come back to me when I want to release some tension. A True Classic.  Remastered Editon sounds even better - but look for the version with the documentary for some revelaing insight into the making of the album.
B00AOQ8KCU|4|Great
B00N0T38LG|5|If you're around my age right now (19), this is gonna be one of those albums that your kids are gonna bring up. And your kid's kids. I loved &#34;The Negative One&#34;, and when Knot release &#34;The Devil In I&#34;, I knew the album wouldn't disappoint.<br /><br />The album is very dark, very heavy, and very catchy. I don't know if I'd call it a complete throwback to Iowa (The Gray Chapter is a much more mature sounding record), but it is definitely full of energy, heavy as a ton of bricks, yet staying melodic, basically Slipknot's signature sound. The lyrics are really dark at times, and if anything on the album is a true throwback to days of old, it's definitely the lyrics. Vulgar yet thoughtful with deeper meanings than you'd think.<br /><br />Pick this up now if you're a maggot, or even just a metal fan in general. It's amazing, it rules, it rocks, it's gonna go down in history as a classic. Don't miss out.
B00CW6DAKC|4|This app is awesome and very addictive. The only thing I am getting mad at, is that it won't let me connect to Facebook so I have no neighbors and I can't get the extra RC that I need to complete on of my machines. This needs to be fixed. Badly.
B0050DIWFC|5|I love William Landay's books and he did not disappoint on this one! A fast read about the love for a child and how far one will go to protect that  child.
B00GQ7OZR0|4|Geographic location is not correct. Dates county music is very diverse. Hannah should have been kept in the shop past.
B007QNRMUU|5|I really enjoy every song on this album! I bought it because I wanted the song 'I Won't Give Up'. That was my wedding song :)
B008HK3XOU|5|I love this standing case for my Kindle Fire HD.  It is much sturdier than it appears  and it locks in so well due to the plastic stabilizing brace built into the case.  You can also charge your Kindle without having to remove it from the case.  I absolutely am so glad I purchased this case.  Worth every penny. Darlene
B00DVKOYBM|5|I play this almost every day. Its fun and challenging
B004MMEF30|4|this is an amazing book... It has its boring parts but if you just keep reading u will know why :)
B006LSZECO|5|Felt that I was deceived when about 40% through, it was revealed that the husband was a cheater...put the book down and picked it up a week later only to discover that the wife made his actions seem almost charitable.  It was a tremendously good read.  The ending was a bit milquetoast, and almost as if they were preparing their readers for the sequel.
B001FB55HQ|4|Ok. Finally a good movie of 2009. Ironic that the dvd itself is weak. The crappy Transformers sequel and Star Trek movies get great treatment but this excellent movie does not???    Anyway.....    This movie is excellent. Great story of redemption. The character Marcus is a death row inmate then changes and becomes hero to mankind, saving John Connor in the end. He gets his second chance at life.  There are many great nods to the other movies. You see how John Connor gets his scar seen in the very first movie. You see the T-800s as they come out of the factories(has the Arnold look), great touch to the 1984 movie.  There is lots of action too and many different versions of the enemy, from snake like to King Kong sized to the evil looking T-600s.  I reccomend this to any Terminator fan.  4 stars for the actual movie and 1 star for the poor dvd release. This was the best action movie of the 2009 summer.   No crude sex jokes or complete insult to the franchise.  Just great sci fi action.  This won't disappoint.
0060589280|3|Mixed feelings.  My first foray into Coelho, and while I appreciate his attempt at delving into the issues of sexuality, the overall impression I'm left with is awkwardness.  I thought his representations of the young woman's thoughts vacillated too much between childish and pendantic and lacked authenticity.  His attempt to elevate conversations around sex were lacking.  This may, at least in part, be due to having been translated from Spanish.  I'll give the Alchemist a shot, but more as feeling a duty to the renowned author and not because I am terribly excited about it.
B0006AP1F8|5|Great read, very informational really liked the way the book was written in an easy to read style.<br />Highly Recommend
B00005J6SZ|5|Sounds great. I had a problem with one copy I bought but I sent immediately and my card was credited in a couple of days.
B005LAIHPY|5|great movie and great price
B002W2U3H4|5|Good fun for the whole family...and a nice break from Thomas and Friends!
B009NPKTN6|5|I was an 80's/90's kid so I loved the music in this movie. My teenage kids get a kick out of it too. It's a great feel good movie.
B007SGLZP8|5|Once again John Grisham came through with a wonderful book.  Grisham is one of my favorite authors and continues to produce great fiction! :-)  This one is no exception.
0375842209|5|Masterfully creative and beautifully written. Unlike other reviewers, this was not a book I couldn't put down and read in a week.  Rather I read and soaked it in slowly, a few chapters at a time...similar to the slow enjoyment of a smooth and delicious, full-bodied glass of red wine.
B00BAXFJ5M|5|I enjoyed this book. I can't write any more.  I am not an author. If forced to do this I won't be able to rate these books.
B000K15VSA|5|I have been waiting for this for years since I saw the Criterion Collection Laserdisc, which I can no longer watch since my Laserdisc player broke...
B000BRBA8S|3|The story line is incoherent futuristic surrealistic-abstract, while future, present, and past are  co-relating to Tony's affairs.<br />To understand this movie better, it'd be better to read symbols instead of picking up the time and the space; and to name a few:<br />* A train of time and memories connects the stories of his encounters.<br />* The android represents one of his encounters, Faye, and himself as Faye's Japanese boyfriend.<br />* Different (speaking) dialects between he and each encounter foreshadow a unrequited relationship.<br /><br />Besides playing the elements of a movie and giving an ostensible beautiful incoherent directing, the story and the movie lack an extension and expansion of the protagonist's passion while interacting with other (over-acting) actresses.<br />I give this movie 2.46 points.
B007PJFFWC|4|Good heartfelt movie. Enjoyable scinematography.
0307454894|5|Bernhard Schlink is amazingly efficient in his writing of this novel.  It's a quick and relatively simple read, but he has not cheated the reader from a complex and courageous story that really, really makes the reader think and reflect.  What exactly the reader might reflect on depends largely on the reader's personal life experiences.  Schlink develops the relationship between the two protagonists, Michael and Hanna, in the first section as an intensely physical relationship between an adolescent boy and a woman twice his age - undoubtedly a fantasy come true for the young man.  But as life would have it, circumstances bring that episode to an end, but not the relationship, which lasts a lifetime - albeit a lifetime of questioning and some frustrations for Michael, given his inability to separate from his young Love or the endless memories forged by his young experiences into his mind.  While the story is uniquely German in that it draws on circumstances some \\"regular\\" Germans were put in during and after World War II, the underlying themes of the story are universal - just about anyone can ponder them in their own lives.  Schlink, through Michael, poses many, many rhetorical questions to the reader.  And though there are many, they never become a hurdle to the fluidity of the story, but serve to continually draw the reader in by engaging the reader's emotion and, at least for me, reminders of experiences of a personal past.  The reader who simply chooses to read this story for the story itself will not be disappointed; the reader who chooses to open themselves to the content between the lines will be changed.
B009UX2YAC|5|Very fun!!! I lo e the way the town's change and new characters are created. Very creative!!
B00C061I3K|1|Okay
B0009HAHD4|5|I used this to Replace my D40 eye cup that thing kept falling off with this it fits perfectly and works great doesn't fall off thank goodness. Definitely a great buy.
B004XJRQUQ|2|I am reviewing the product itself rather than the story because chances are you already have heard what a great story it is. Unfortunately the Kindle edition has some major flaws with the formatting. I went with 2 stars instead of 1 because it is readable, but that doesn't mean it is acceptable. The fact that the font size randomly changes from chapter to chapter and sometimes even within a chapter is extremely annoying. I can't understand why Amazon and/or the publisher won't fix this. Its a known issue that has existed for a long time now.
0525478817|5|Such a great book! Laughed, cried... Cried some more. John Green does an incredible job of capturing the feelings of a teenager. Gave these out as gifts for a party and the ladies were excited to receive it and read!
B00005LOUP|5|Jim Carrey in the rest of the cast did a wonderful job in bringing this doctor Seuss How the Grinch Stole Christmas to a live action classic it's just a wonderful movie to watch with the whole family if you love How the Grinch Stole Christmas the animated version by Doctor Seuss you will love this Jim Carrey version did splendid job with the special  makeup its it's just wonderful
B0050DIWFC|5|A page turner that keeps you guessing! Definitely recommend this to anyone that loves mystery and surprise endings! A must read!
B00A3NQNUU|5|This game is great must have!!! so much stuff to do and many things do explore. you have to download
B009C7ZQM4|5|My kindle fire had less than a gig and would not empty any more space no matter what I tried to get rid of. The Clean Master cleaned out all unnesssesary junk and gave me more than half of my internal storage space back. No other cleaning app could the same. My kindle is still in tact.
B007J4T2G8|3|Fifty Shades was an erotic read that excited me with every sex scene. What failed to hold my attention was the poorly planned out plot - I honestly cannot read one more scene of Anastasia Steele &#34;interrogating&#34; or &#34;conversing&#34; with Grey. I found myself skipping over more scenes than I was reading. I recommend saving yourself some time and just watching porn instead.
B008KP6ENE|5|This is a very entertaining, addicting  game that is cute, fun for kids and all other ages alike, and poses a challenge instead of being boring like most games. My only complaint is that on the Drag'n Dash feature, it does this weird thing where it runs out of platforms and you can't go any farther. It's hard to explain. But, it is something that you should definitely get, and if you are wondering whether you should get it or not because it costs something, it is worth the 99 cents. I encourage you to get it, unless you cannot afford .99,  then you should keep it in mind for later.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good, fun game that is unlike most, and although it looks like it is for youngsters, it is actually fine for all ages.<br /><br />Have fun playing it!
B007SYWFRM|5|This is a very fun game. Similar to farmville but with ice age characters. just started playing it and I am hooked
B007FG9LIE|5|Take a big heap of Twilight Zone, add a mess of Twin Peaks, some X-Files and some Lost and you have a great recipe for several hours of uninterrupted twists and turns.<br /><br />Downloaded the second book before I finished the first and am now pissed that I have to wait almost 4 months for the third.  The only thing that I would ding the author for us that the end of each book is more of a pause leading into the next book rather than a closing of that book.<br /><br />But that being said, it was well worth the time and money!
B00JE5NR4I|5|Entertaining! For fans of Japanese samurai movies, it may embody too much fantasy. I found it very interesting and entertaining!!<br />Acting and action scenes were very good!!.
0800141865|5|Thank you. It's great!
B007VUA7VO|1|Installing this made my phone crash over and over again.  I had to reset the entire device.  It seems to be the most \\"unsafe\\" app I've ever encountered.  Just seeing it on my list of apps scares me.
B00GPWEQ70|5|This is absolutely one of the best films I have seen this year. tom hanks and emma Thompson are terrific. tom hanks portrays Disney very well. the story is fantastic and I now have a new respect for the movie mary poppins. it was made with so much love and sacrifice from both Disney and traverse. in the movie traverse is quit a nasty and rude woman but when the climax comes you will understand why. the movie is funny and heartwarming. and just to warn you, you might cry at the end I did. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B001K3EXTA|5|I had forgotten how handsome Robert Redford was... I totally enjoyed the movie...loved the music...acting...and the automobiles...I will watch again!
B00TEAVEY8|5|This is a good game the only thing I don't like is that you have energy and when you done with a level it don't add the energy you all r ready have it takes it away and just give you 110 but it is a fun game
B00F35BV64|1|One of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. I couldn't finish watching it. I started to rewatch Alias on Netflix just to remind myself that Abrams isn't actually a completely incompetent storyteller.
B003DDKAT2|4|the star power in this movie is outstanding, well performed and written.  the part that I enjoyed the most was the narrative.  By narrative I mean the thoughts in the lead character, Louis.  A powerhouse of a movie, and it holds up very well since its release in the 90's.  not many do (think technology as in the old bricks that were cell phones, etc. )
B00004STPT|5|I purchased the soundtrack before I ever saw the movie.  I found this soundtrack to be so very moving to my soul.  It has so many emotions interspersed throughout the album.  This album made me become more interested in Hans Zimmer's music.  I find him to be a musical genius.  He knows how to capture a feeling to bring you into a movie that amazes me.  If I may recommend,  listen to his other movie soundtracks.  You may be surprised to find out just how many he has and how awesome he is.
B00IJJUIMY|5|Well constructed,no excessive violence or car chases.  Good momentum and teamwork. I really enjoy Harry Bosch and the travails of the LAPD politics and personalities
B000EOTAM6|2|This was a terrible movie.  I used to watch the cartoon and it was really good.  This movies is for men to watch skinny ladies in skin tight clothes.
B00475BUVM|5|I loved it
B001KVZ6HK|5|I had the privlege of seeing this before the day before it was released since I was a movie theater employee.  What I had called the &#34;Rag-doll scene&#34; (and so did many others once it was released) got tons of laughs from myself and from my co-workers.  There were plenty more scenes that matched this laug throughout the film.  Word of the wise, there are two post credit scenes!
B007FG9LIE|4|Interesting, easy to read...
B001GCUNW6|5|I saw this movie in theaters and thought that was ok, I bought in bluray for my kids. I watch it at home and I really like it, now I think it's he best of the 3. PQ and SQ excellent.
B00H71PHS0|5|A wonderful series beginning in pre world war one England.  Not my usual fare, but I did become a fan.
B001CIPU3G|2|On Shogun, Trivium resume the path to mediocrity they briefly strayed from with 2006's The Crusade. The shopworn aggro metalcore the band continue to practice was barely passable when they released their sophomore disc in 2005: in 2008 it's just embarrassing. While The Crusade showcased a slight evolution for the band, Shogun throws conceptions like \\"logical progression\\" and \\"artistic development\\" to the wind. In all earnestness, it's very likely the dullest and most redundant metal album of the year. There is absolutely nothing on Shogun to differentiate it from Ascendancy, or even their debut album Ember to Inferno. Despite his overt talent at purveying conventional thrash metal vocals, singer Matt Heafy chooses to monotonously scream his way through most of the album, forgoing actual singing in an abrasive attempt to prove his manhood. The album bombards you with trite, uninventive riffs, generic metal scales, and horrendous vocals without offering even a moment of respite from the tough-guy metalcore comprising the entirety of the disc's 11 tracks. Simply put, listening to Shogun is a chore. You'd be well advised to simply pass this one by in favor recent discs from superior practitioners like In This Moment and Bullet For My Valentine instead.
B002G4FQI4|5|This item was guaranteed to be free of any defects and it was delivered as said. Excellent product and seller!
B00LFVTGE4|5|This whole album is excellent.
B00BWWS81S|5|So happy that my family took me to a KT Tunstall concert.  I have enjoyed all of her CD's, and this one is no exception.
B0000AQS0F|5|Don't let a travesty go unscathed! If you love Firefly and are in utter horror that it's canceled tell Fox! Tell them twice, just tell them! Maybe we'll get a movie, maybe a show. Go to Fox.com and look for an email drop-box. Go ahead, be mean!<br />At LEAST they may finally realize that airing them out-of-order, and NOT airing the three BEST episodes was in fact, ASININE. The pilot is actually pretty terrible (as most can be), but the evolution of the others is impeccable and even becomes a sheer masterpiece (as one might gather from these reviews). So believe it, you won't be dissappointed with this set and then you too, will be in horror, yet glad to have something rather than nothing at all..
B00742GBDM|5|Frances O'Conner does a great job in this Jane Austin movie - I really enjoyed it
B008BQ8YHQ|5|Really good acting, character development, and plot progression. Looking forward to how rachel changes I'm season 3. I I i
B00MU79IL8|5|Terrific! Gags has a suprisingly beautiful voice, but it is really the music that creates the magic. How could we have lost it ?
B001974DG0|4|I have never read a DK book. I love Stephen King books. Is this a good book to start with? I read the sample, it seemed interesting. Can someone recommend a good book by this author? From the reviews I read \\"Watchers\\" seemed very popular.
B002WR791W|5|See it with pacific and flags of our fathers.
B008WOPHO0|5|Awesome!
B00MU9R5OI|1|SINCE IT HAS NEVER DOWNLOADED I WOULD NOT KNOW IF I LIKE IT OR NOT
B00AIUUXHC|4|Great game .but all the blood is not necessary. I think the makers of this game should take all of the blood out of the game. Thanks! :D
B00IKZX1ZI|5|I think it is really fun to play after a really hard day.
B00030590I|5|This movie was excellent from start to finish. It is a show of great cinematography and visual effects. Although the effects are a little crazy after a little while, it is stilll an excellent movie. It shows what a true hero to Chinese culture. The only flaw I thought that there was in this movie would be its ending. Its ending gives off a great message but still does not entirely make sense, even in a movie that if you are to watch it, must be taken more as a fantasy story than a historical fiction or non-fiction story.
B000W00Y0Y|5|Great concert, very fast paced songs. The bonus commentary by Brian May and Roger Taylor is very funny and heart warming. A must have only if you get it for the Live Aid bonus concert.
0971855110|5|This book had changed my life. Because I have read it, I am happier, my home is squeaky clean and my life is so much simpler and organized. I have never been know to be a neat person and my husband and friends are amazed by my new habits. Flylady taught me that a few daily and simple routines make a huge difference in my family's way of living. This book is worth every penny.. Can you really put a price on having an enriched quality of life? Oh, also it's easy to read and funny!
B000007U6W|5|i just bought this album today and love it. i had the original L.P. when it came out in 1974. i'm glad they put it on c.d. Autobahn is great to meditate to. the kometenmelodie 2 is wonderful too. this is just a super great album. if you like electronic music, this is a must to have.
1587613379|5|It is a wonderful piece of writing that acknowledges the reality in which we live and delves into the practical and ethical aspects experienced by those seeking a more loving lifestyle. A worthwhile read regardless of one's stance on polyamory.
B00DJUPLY8|5|Wow. Finally a media player that actually works. I've had problems finding a player that would play MKV and AC3 files. This one plays them all. And its free. Wth!
1847879063|5|Excellent explanation of statistical terms and formulas. Andy Field uses his life experiences and integrates to illustrate an understanding of terms. Drawing and tables additionally provide clarification of statistical tests.
B000002KFJ|5|One of My favorite old Sabbath albums I have them all
B00AOCLWF6|3|Great Action, and really impressive aliens, The aliens are the stars of this series. The rest of the plot is very predictable<br />and falls into the rut so many of these series find themselves in as the series progresses. It is very worthy entertainment<br />though. Watch it just for the aliens and you won't be disappointed.
B008WCP2KG|5|Hot movie. Loved Channing Tatem. That's why he is named Sexiest Man Alive on Peoples Magazine. Terrific Dancing and very sexy movie.
B00CO5AQ12|5|The little one loves it.  Not gonna lie.  I love it too.
B00JVZ0DQG|4|Addicting and relaxing
B00018D44U|4|I'm a big fan of this small woman with the sweet and powerful voice. This is good, laid-back, moody and unpretentious music.
B005LAIGSM|5|My mother loved this movie. Don't know what else to say. I bought it for her. So that's about it.
B00BD99JMW|2|I was really looking forward to this, but I was disappointed. It seems like it was almost written by a different author than the first two.  The quick chapters alternating between Tris'  voice and Tobias' were really distracting, someone at Corporate convinced Veronica Roth to pander to the fangirls with &#34;more Tobias&#34;. .<br /><br />All of the depth of Tris's character disappeared and of the faction worldbuilding was just abandoned. People just drove in and out of the wall at will. And how do you just drop someone in to Dauntless at age 15 with new memories?  Wouldn't anyone else notice the sudden appearance?  And you could definitely see a lit up O'Hare airport from the Hancock Building or Sears Tower at night.  I think the only time it felt as good as the other books was the last scene between Tris and Caleb.<br /><br />I think Divergent will make a good movie, I'm looking forward to it.
B00DR0PDNE|2|Arrived before time - Awesome<br /><br />My below observation is using my laptop with internet speed of 12mbps<br />Youtube - streaming well with quality<br />Neflix - streaming well with quality<br />When cast  tab or desktop(beta) with running video in browser the first frame/picture cast and then hangs without any video or audio. I am sure they will improve this in future.<br /><br />I am returning this and may buy again when cast tab & desktop without any issue.<br />If you are looking for cast only youtube and netflix this is really very nice device.
B00KMX5V8G|3|still trying to get into it
B007SGM084|4|I don't know..... I read all three books in about a week.  I kept feeling like I had read the story before.  Than it dawned on me.  It was Beauty and the Beast with kinky fuckery.
B007SGM084|5|I haven't sat down to read a book in a long time, due to being a mom. But after seeing the movie _ which, before I saw it, I knew nothing about 50 shades_ I was absolutely hooked and I had to get the books. I finished all three in one week, finishing the first book in less than two days, as well as the second one. I could not put my Kindle down! I'm not really sure why the books had such bad reviews because I found them very entertaining and beguiling. I cannot wait for the 50 shades grater and 50 shades freed, movies to come out!
B00HYTSTNU|5|This movie is intense from beginning yo end very good movie. I love it and I would recommend to anybody to watch it.
B007SWZVBQ|5|Love this.
B008MG1E4A|5|This book is an interesting read if you want truth about the Navy SEALS who took Osama bin Laden out, and not just what comes out of the Oval Office.
B00AQ3K8IU|3|I was not completely captivated by the story, but it held my interest in a few sections. It became predictable near the end and was just too neat of an ending.
B00C5XBAOA|5|Excelente
B0000025P9|5|\\"IV\\" won the Grammy for album of the year, giving them the respect at last that they so richly deserved.  This album is filled with the high quality mid-tempo tracks \\"Rosanna\\", \\"Make Believe\\" and \\"Africa\\", as well as the amazing ballad \\"I Won't Hold You Back\\" and the twin rockers \\"Afraid Of Love\\" and \\"Lovers In The Night\\".  This album has aged well and could easily have been just as successful in any generation.  I'm not sure to this day if I like the progressive Toto, the hard rocking Toto or the soulful Toto best.  I do know that the styles meshed perfectly here and caught the ear of the public once again - and Toto's numerous fans felt a sense of vindication from the band's critics at last.
B000084T18|5|When Jay-Z wrote \\"Takeover\\" I doubt even he invisioned an invasion like the one 50 Cent launched on the rap world with GET RICH OR DIE TRYING.  With Eminem and Dr. Dre executive producing, the press about his 2Pac like survival of an assasination attempt that left him with 9 holes, his beef with Ja Rule and Murder Inc. and \\"In Da Club\\" bumping anywhere you went this had to be the most hyped rap album since...?  The truth is \\"In Da Club\\" was such a good song and the hype was so huge I was actually somewhat disappointed the first spin of this disc, but after I realized that this wasn't 2Pac or Eminem and listened to it again I realized that while not the  greatest rap album of all time it is a great CD.  50's not the tightest with rymes, but he makes up for it with attitude, lots of controversy and a great laid back flow that any song can benefit from.  With Dre and Em handling the bulk of the production this album runs one classic song right into another.  \\"Many Men\\" is his most Pac-like introspective song revealing his justified paranoia that many men wish death upon him.  \\"Patiently Waiting\\" is produced by Eminem and he delivers an amazing verse that sounds like he's possessed and reaffirms he is still the superior MC, but 50 still shines all over the album.  Other radio staples like \\"P.I.M.P.\\" and \\"21 Questions\\" featuring Nate Dogg confirm the classic status of this album.  50 successfully conquered the industry and put the rap game in a choke hold with this album.
0440246318|1|Here is a fine example of how an editor is afraid to touch a popular author. This book is 600 pages. I quit it at about 300. Lee Child was wasting my time, not entertaining me.

1250012570|5|*Review posted on Mundie Moms on 5/31/13*<br /><br />Every year since I began reviewing, there seems to be a story that surprises me. It's usually a quietly launched story without a lot of over-hyped buzz, but it picks up steam as it passes from reviewer to reviewer and friend to friend. It's the story that your good, bookworm friends will text you about and insist you need to read it next. It's the story that once you do read, you understand immediately why your friends encouraged you to read it and so in turn, you pass it along to someone who hasn't read it, yet. Eleanor and Park is just such a story.<br /><br />First, I remember 1986 a little too well, and I remember the music a little too well. I also remember the biases of small towns towards anyone who didn't fit the norm. I use this phrase entirely too much, so here it goes again -- lovely, layered characters. That's exactly what Rainbow brings us. It's not just Eleanor and Park who I feel I know so well that when I climb onto a school bus (for my kids' field trips), I expect to see them in the back. It's also the parents, especially Park's, that rang so true. His mom could be my mom if you swap out her Korean upbringing for a Serbian one. Rainbow delivers glimpses of their back-stories in a few short sentences that left me shattered at what the mom, in particular, must have experienced. I won't even discuss Park's dad, because in Rainbow's capable hands he's THAT guy; oh trust me, you'll know it when you read it. He's the guy that is so consistent; I simply fell in love with both his parents. And in them, I saw hope for what Eleanor and Park could become.<br /><br />But wait, you say, Sophie this book is not called Park's parents. Okay, it's not. I'm trying to not spoil things because Eleanor lives a tough life. An awful life. In the midst of what should be hopeless despair, she finds pockets of sanity for herself, and she finds Park. Watching her allow Park into her life made this story, for me, one of the most satisfying reads this year. I won't even talk about the ending because it contained words that broke my heart, yes, in a good way.most satisfying reads this year. I won't even talk about the ending because it contained words that broke my heart, yes, in a good way.
B00F91H666|4|The movie was actually pretty darn cool.  More violent than I expected for some reason.  I guess I thought it would be more tame since Brad Pitt was in it and I don't think of him as very edgy anymore.<br /><br />But I gotta say that I watched it on Amazon Instant Video and it paused many times to reload.  Bummer.
0891419063|5|E.B. \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge writes an amazing memoir of the Marine Corps in WWII and one of its great, forgotten battles, Peleliu. Sledge brings home the utter brutality of war in vivid descriptions. You have to wonder how different WWII might have been if we had the same ease of instant communications that we have today. The soldiers, sailors and Marines of that era were so isolated in these forlorn locations.<br /><br />His insights on human nature, the esprit de corps of the US Marines and the bonds that are forged in war are just great.
B0001LYH9S|5|The eerie storyline that ties the songs together adds to the fantasy and mood of the CD. A dismal, desperate attitude in the lyrics and sometimes discordant music. Add to this David Bowie's ethereal voice and you've got a great masterpiece of industrial music.
B00ESF285S|3|I bought this for the grandkids to read.  It is not one of their favorites yet but since I have so many other Dr. Seuss books as they get older I think they will enjoy the book.
0307476073|1|This was the most boring book I've ever read. I was waiting for something to happen, and then it ended. She hiked the PCT, the end. Don't waste your time.
B000001FFR|5|Whenever I am on the highways for long periods of time,I make sure I have this with me.My favorite tracks are &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Lone Justice&quot; and &quot;The Enemy&quot;.I absolutely must  recommend this to anyone who doesn't already have it.
B00005JM4Z|4|Great product, got just what I wanted. The cover was in good condition and there were no scratches on the actual cd.
0061128562|5|This was a great low cost alternative to the more expensive books of the same title.  Came with mini book and a CD both were perfect.  My grand children love the story.
B00005NGZX|5|When i first heard of this band, there was alot of hype. And like when any band has so much hype surrounding them, there is always doubts before hearing them. I recently bought this CD, my first of theirs, after deciding that it's time i truly gave them a chance. After listening to this album, i've been kicking myself for not getting into them any earlier. The intensity is just unbelievable. Musicianship is amazing. Riffs are brutal and relentless. The vocals underneath the chaos are just awesome, fitting the music perfectly i think. <br /> <br />Song after song after song on this album, just leaves you wanting more, more, more..especially (!) the last song, \\"Jane Doe\\". Going for at least 11 minutes, it is THE coolest (new..to me) song i have heard in a long time. It seems to stretch on for ages and ages, but you don't get restless while listening to it, instead you kinda..(well, i did)..get excited. Then the album finally finishes, the last song floating away into the distance and you're left going..\\"Like..Whoa\\". <br /> <br />As for my favorite tracks, i just can't pick a favorite really. Except for the final song, which is totally outstanding, every song is just as listenable as the previous one. Not one song on this CD i can skip, nor want to skip at all. It all makes for around 45 minutes of astonishing chaos. Converge remind me alot of bands like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Buried Inside, Black Dice and even Pig Destroyer to a lesser extent. Converge are just a punishingly brutal band, with total intensity and fantastic musicianship being some of their excellent trademarks. <br /> <br />One thing is for sure, when it comes to this band..Believe the Hype. Absolutely 5/5.
B00W3V83QW|5|Fun to play, keeps me busy.
0316056863|3|I ordered Bossypants through Amazon so it would be $10 in hardcover. I'm glad I didn't spend more for such a short, easy read. Not as witty and smart as I'd hoped for considering Fey is known as a talented writer. I enjoy 30 Rock, but I've learned to expect little from memoirs by high-profile female comedians. I didn't think Kathy Griffin or Chelsea Handler's were good at all. Bossypants seems half-assed and either ghostwritten or lazily written by someone who can do better (but why bother when she's so busy with 30 Rock and will make lotsa money off book sales either way?) I basically read the book to avoid denser material and only read the whole thing because it was over before it started. I think pretty highly of Tina Fey, but this seems like some half-baked effort she barely exerted herself on. It seems like female comedians just churn out these sub-par memoirs because women buy more books than men and are hungry for memoirs by other females. It's not like Fey is trying to write a game-changing book people will refer to several decades from now, it's just to make a quick buck off an easily sold target demo.

B0068LYEHA|3|I read this book for a book club.  It sparked some VERY good conversations.  It touches on a lot of great women's issues in a lighthearted way.  The first half of the book was hard to get through.  The chapters dragged on a bit for my liking.  But at the end I was captivated.  There is a lot of British humor that I didn't get, but I'm sure would be funny to those who live there or are more aware of their social culture.<br />The author does a really good job of presenting the topics and her point of view.  A good feminist read!! :)
B00BF11STU|5|Loved the movie.  It did a good job of conveying how much our military (and other govt. agencies) does for our freedom.
B005D646RE|5|The writing, directing, and acting were all superb.  I can’t think of anything negative to say about this season.  It was suspenseful, edgy, and above all else, entertaining.  It continues to be the best show out there.  Make sure to check it out.
B005RUUUAI|5|A very addicting show, love it, counting down till the new season begins, October is so far away. Great show
1616550414|5|In depth information of zelda. It connects all the stories and makes sense of them. Bought for a family of Zelda fans and we all enjoy. A+++++++
B000EULJLU|5|I have been counting the days, and years, until the next Tool relaease and once again it was well worth the wait!  There is a reason why Maynard James Keenan, Adam Jones, Danny Carey, and Justin Chancellor are all gods, it is because they manage to not let down their fans, EVER with ANYTHING they put out.  From Opiate till now, this band has never let us down.  Lyrically, Maynard is at his best.  I cant wait to see what Adam has up his sleeve for the new videos!!!  Not only that but the album cover is pretty darn nifty too.  As for the music; Vicarious makes me feel like I am in the stereo.  The lyrics, the bass, it all becomes a part of you.  I listened to this for the first time the way I have always loved to listen to Tool--in the dark with the stereo as high as I can take.  You feel sucked into the album.  As if your heartbeat is the bassline.  As if your breathing is the drums.  As if your blood is Maynard's beautifully melodic voice.  This album, once again, excites me to my very core.  Maynard, I LOVE YOU.
B005ZOBNOI|4|Wonderful story told with wonderful language. This book will be enjoyed by adults of any age as it has strong messages on how to deal with very unfortunate personal circumstances.
B0000A118M|5|<br />Yes, there is no better jazz album (or if you prefer, disc). <br /> <br />Listen to the urgency, the striving, the aspiring.  This was John Coltrane's paen to the divine.  This was his leap for the immortal and his immortality.  He succeeded both ways more than he would ever know. <br /> <br />Churches have been organized around this music.  This is no joke.  Modern-day fundamentalists should listen too--hint:  it's about The Big Guy (or Gal). <br /> <br />For the naysayers and doubters:  Put away your Kenny G and smooth-jazz albums.  At least for the time it takes to listen to \\"A Love Supreme.\\"  Put it on.  Play it over and over.  Listen for the nuances of 'Trane's sax, the young McCoy Tyner's majestic piano chords, Garrison's and Elvin Jones' resounding bass and rhythm lines.  Listen without prejudice for about 10 or 30 times.  Put it on in your car or at home.  Above all, play it for your children.  Then say you're not moved. <br /> <br />These are not \\"old farts\\" in the words of one Amazon reviewer.  These are masters who were recording one of the greatest gifts humankind has ever known.  Yes, the recording is not the best; it was 1964, an analog/two-track world before zeros and one and who-knows how many channels.  Yes, Coltrane explores some upper register sounds (yeooo; my i-pod's turned up too loud!)  But what these four master musicians did has only grown in stature these forty years later.  When people who appreciate music 40 years hence have forgotten about what passes for ersatz jazz these days they'll be listening to this one.
B000VXLC3K|4|I'll admit -- I'm one of those people who feel that TAPESTRY is one of the greatest albums of all time.  So my review of this new 2-CD edition is colored by that view.<br /><br />TAPESTRY is one of only a handful of albums ever released that contains only total winners (in terms of songs).  Many artists produce great albums, but there are always a couple of songs that I don't like as much as the others.  Not so with TAPESTRY.  Every song on the album deserves five stars.<br /><br />This 2-CD set contains the complete original album, along with a second disc of previously-unreleased live recordings of (most of) the songs from the album.  These live versions were chosen because they strip the songs down to their pure essence -- Carole at the keyboard and on vocals, with nothing else.  This is a fantastic thing to have paired with the original album.  Sound quality is excellent, performances are inspired and passionate.<br /><br />The set loses a star, though, because it's just not as good as it COULD have been.  TAPESTRY has already been issued in a remastered, expanded edition.  (This version appears to be the same mastering as the previous one.)  However, the first expanded edition included two bonus tracks (one a previously-unreleased studio track, the other a live recording), and neither of those bonus tracks were included in this new edition.  So if you want to have a \\"complete\\" TAPESTRY, you have to own both versions of the album.  To me, this smacks of record company greed -- let's see how many times we can get these suckers to buy the same album.  Sony has done this same thing recently with Michael Jackson's THRILLER.  And Elvis Costello fans know all about this sort of thing...<br /><br />If you're a Carole King fan, you will definitely want this set.  If you don't care about live versions of the songs, you can stick with the single-disc remastered version from a few years back.  But if, like me, you're a die-hard aficionado, you'll have to have both.  It's only shelf space!
0060765488|4|This is a fantastic book. It takes you into a magical land that can only be created by one such as C.S. Lewis. There is never a dull moment which is good if you get bored with reading easily. However, there are a few downfalls. The book itself is relativley fast paced and sometimes the narrartion is a bit childish. All in all its a good read and a classic that nobody should ever miss out on.
B0086700CM|1|I would probably play this game if it weren't for the thousands of obviously fake 5 star reviews.  Seriously??  Just be honest about it and I'm sure you'd get more downloads!
B00003JRCQ|5|I love this story and I love this version of Persuasion. I could watch this movie multiple times and still not get bored.
B000PFUAO6|2|... this is for you. <br /> <br />I don't play an instrument (except for a mean guitar on Guitar Hero) so I can't comment on their musical ability - I initially got into DT during the Pull Me Under era because they sounded like nothing I had heard before and their lyrics painted a picture and were intelligent, not generic and cliched. <br /> <br />That DT, I fear, is dead. <br /> <br />When I saw they were signed to Roadrunner I thought ... good.  When I saw they were producing their album alone again I thought ... bad.  Unfortunately, there was little good to this release.  If you are a blind adherent I'm sure you'll think this is another stellar release, but I can't get past the cheesy lyrics, Portney's horrific vocal \\"stylings\\", and Ruddess doing nothing for me.  I mean ... how can you not laugh during \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" - with laughable lyrics and an even worse vocal delivery?  Why can't they have an outside producer come in - is it an ego thing? <br /> <br />I agree, at times, that in some cases a CD requires multiple listens to appreciate, but should they really?  Shouldn't it stand out from the crowd from the beginning?  I think so.  I cringed the moment I played the first track and it didn't get much better, until The Ministry of Lost Souls - which was tolerable.  But of course - the track was about 5 minutes too long. <br /> <br />Obviously I am in the minority, but this thing is a clunker.  Loud and uninspired, this is the last time I buy DT on the first day of release - if at all.  Sorry guys, try again.
B004J4WKUQ|5|\\"Ready Player One\\" is a rendition of the Hero's Journey that's custom tailored for the nerdy geeks in all of us.  Whether you get every reference or only a few, it's a fun ride.

B004LOMB2Q|4|I Installed this on the computer, kindle fire, and two phones. I love the ability to make a shopping list and my husband will get it at the store.
B00COMLLX2|5|Love it! Enjoy playing every evening after I lay down. No problems . No glitches. Would recommend it to anyone who likes pinball.<br />I'm over 13. Tried to submit a review.
0670014893|4|Enjoyed this story and really liked the way it moved.  Don't want to spoil the story so will just say the plot construction worked for me and I enjoyed the themes.
B000003S09|5|I first heard this from a dub tape a friend had made for me. He had incluled \\"Karn Evil 9\\" by ELP as the first track. I literally jumped the first time I heard \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", it being the second track. For a 16 year old, this meant:keeper! This is a true classic album, if only for the lyrics. Listen closely to \\"Epitaph\\" and you will understand. It sounds like it was made very recently; I hear something \\"new\\" with each playing. And be prepared for the \\"surprise\\" at the end of \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\"...

B0036TGT2A|5|Love the Disney movies and always have and this is no exception.  Was very beautiful to see this again and in 3D.  Before purchasing this, I had also recently gone to see the stage production in our area and it provided a whole new level of magic and music to the experience as well.  I recommend this for any disney fans, old and new!

B00J6YA1V4|4|Ann Rice's new book, PRINCE LESTAT, is another great vampire genre book that will be added to the classics of horror fiction. Her characters as always are fully developed and full of human frailties but in Lestat we see a maturation from the Brat Prince whom we have come to know. The book is full of characters both new and old who inhabit the dark realm of the night walkers.<br />This is a great read and I highly recommend it to all vampire fans and Ann Rice junkies such as myself.<br /><br />Gaston Sanders, Author
B002ZCDR88|5|I'm at a loss for those who don't see this album as creative genius. Perhaps they are pissed it wasn't Lady *aga who thought of it.  I agree this is nothing like her prior works, but Leave Your Sleep is as relevant as all her prior solo work. To me this album was so out of the box in a quiet way, it may be overlooked and misjudged, which shows how much courage it takes to create an album like this one.  Each song is based on a poem written by poets of long ago, their stories are interesting and thought provoking and through her incorporation of words, the songs are confronting, meaningful and inspiring. The musicality is spot on and is matched so well to the flow of the meaning and lyrics of each song, as is her amazing voice. All is seen through a child's eyes... now that could be the reason some don't understand.

B001RIY49C|4|Gosh in my entire DVD collections, Terminator 2 is the worst one as I spent so much on double/triple dipping from the Ultimate Edition to the Black Edition to the Extreme Edition...<br /><br />When it was initially released in Blu-ray, I got it though knowing it has no extended scenes. Now here comes another edition that will suck our money again!<br /><br />I really hate such marketing plot but being a T2 fan, I just can't help it...Geez if they release another edition again I shall go nuts!!<br /><br />**********<br /><br />Update: The video quality is slightly better than the original released Blu-ray but the audio quality surpassed the revious BD!<br />The previous Blu-ray release of 'Terminator 2' featured only a Dolby Digital EX mix, and no true high-res audio option but this one the studio gives us a DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 6.1 Surround track at 48kHz/16-bit which sound much superior than the old one!
0316044695|5|Great book, good group of men that served their country to the end.  Should have read before the movie for sure.
B004XDYJRU|1|I did not get it on my phone when I made the purchase today thank you for taking my money .
B0006399FS|5|How does a band pull off music this good 25 years after their first release?  That, in my view, is unprecedented.  The disadvantage a band like this has is that anything new they release will inevitably be compared to their back catalog.  Regardless, \\"How To...\\" holds up extremely well.  Probably a notch below their very best work, but one I'll still be taking off the shelf years from now. <br /> <br />U2 received flak from some critics for reverting to their 80s sound circa Unforgettable Fire and Joshua Tree.  Not a fair assessment.  Although The Edge's trademark chiming guitar is more evident than it has been since then, this CD has an overall tougher and grittier sound.  Besides which, it's just great rock and roll with one catchy and memorable tune after another.   <br /> <br />There are really distinct melodies within, so don't think you know the album just from the singles (besides which, \\"All Because Of You\\" is, in my view, not one of the strongest cuts on the CD).  You'd then be missing out on tracks that should become U2 standards such as \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"City Of Blinding Lights\\", \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\", \\"Origin Of the Species\\", and \\"Yahweh\\".  Altogether there are zero weak songs here.  I never find myself reaching for the skip button on any of the songs and that's rare. <br /> <br />This is a band at the top of its game and one of the most engaging rock releases so far in the new millenium.  As of this writing I think this CD still has a lot of legs, especially as their North American tour kicks into gear.
1455113549|4|I don't believe anyone in our book club saw the ending coming!  We liked the book but not the family, very<br />dysfunctional.  Most wanted Jacob to be innocent of the crime but the blood on the bathing suit made them<br />believe he was guilt.  Probably the best book discussion we have had in a long time.  It's a book we will<br />remember for a long time.<br />  Pat Sibley
B00729GQ0A|5|This was a great book. I enjoyed it so much I pre-ordered the second one. Nice to see a book that showed Wicca in a good light. As a practitioner of The Craft myself it's hard to find a fictional book that understands The Craft in any way. This one did. I saw when I pre-ordered the second in the series it has been optioned for a film. I will be going to see it. I loved the tension between Sophia and Charles and how it showed falling in love is never easy. I really enjoyed this book.
1101946342|2|Not what I was expecting it to be.
1609611543|5|Everyone should read this book.  Very insightful on how bad we eat and what we put in out bodies.  Great inspiration to create eating habits and change.
B00BETX5PS|4|I am a life long James Bond fan though I haven't always loved all of the actors who have played him.  It seems that with the increase in computer graphics action movies have moved more and more toward high tech action sequences and away from good story plots.  I have been so bored with movies that basically nothing more than one action sequence after another with little story to tie the movie together.  It should be possible to have a balance.  This Bond movie was the first in a LONG while that was low on tech yet still HIGH on action, plus it had a good story plot.  And some of you might have always known what &#34;Q&#34; stood for, but naive me I didn't so this movie explained that little mystery for me.  I'll admit I still don't know if &#34;M&#34; is supposed to stand for something or not as they didn't give us that one, but maybe one tidbit should be enough for me.  Right?

B003FSTN52|5|This is one of my favorite shows, so I was happy to receive the season so quicker.  I don't get to always watch them when they come on tv, so this gives me a chance to catch up.
B0070Y46UY|5|Lots of strong similes. Religious and social beliefs come out through the simple texts.  Like the movie, a little long but worthwhile to read
B004HO6I2E|4|Yet, another movie that was really good that gets a mere 3 stars on Amazon. The shock!! Basically, morons review movies. If a movie on here gets 2-3 stars, it is usually great. If it gets 4-5 stars, there's a 50/50 it sucks.
B00005Q66T|5|I must start off this review by admitting that I was a child when she first became a household name in the 80's, and was too young to have appreciated her musical greatness. Then the 90's came (along with my teenage years, and I started to get into her songs more). Fortunately for me,(and other fans who have appreciated her since the 80's or 90's) this music collection contains many of the great songs from the 90's and early millenium that fans have come to love. Even if you are a casual fan, I would still recommend this collection because there is something for everyone. Some of the hits that are included in this collection are \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", \\"Music\\", \\"Human Nature,\\" and my personal favorite \\"Erotica\\". One of the reasons why I like \\"Erotica\\" is because she showed through that song that it is fine to be a sensual, sexual, and self-confident person all at the same time. Obviously, there are other good songs on there besides the ones that I just mentioned, but it was important to me to at least offer a sampling of the great and diverse selection of songs. Many hardcore fans and even occasional and/or casual fans are going to find some songs to love in this collection.

B004GHNIRK|5|Never in my life have I read a book that was so thoroughly authored. No author in my experience exists, who can as marvelously developed his/her characters as well as Victor Hugo in this book. Nor do I remember a book that brought—as little as it may be—tears to my eyes. “Les Mis&eacute;rables” a MUST on every one’s reading list, young or old.<br />If you do know the story, I’d recommend this abridged version. But if you have never read or know little of this magnificent tale, get the full experience.

B004YEJGEO|4|I really can&apos;t get enough of this game. I&apos;ve been playing everyday since I got it. Great job in providing just enough levels to get started but complexity has been steadily increasing. Only one problem that I&apos;ve been having is selecting the beams that come out of the prism. Almost gave up on it in the beginning. For that, I give it a 4 star.
B008JFUNKU|4|Really liked the movie.  Love Tom Hanks in all of his movies and really liked him in this movie.  Kept myinterest in the whole movie.
B0029VUV70|5|Kate was on point and truly believable in her portrayal of a lonely haunted women. I don't know how I missed this one, another must see.
B006R4H5FG|4|I like the way the writer expresses his points...<br />I think he gives very useful  tips when you are making presentations in public
B00DGKQF2S|5|I've listened 3 or 4 times now and I'm really enjoying this album. Of course those who love great musicianship in a rock setting will find a lot to like here. I did not know Kotzen could sing like this! To me he sounds like Chris Cornell from Temple of the Dog; just a very cool rock voice! Great musicians making music together and a whole lot of fun!
B00KLF5J64|5|1970s kids you loathed the music at the time yet will put it on continuous repeat in the car or gym.  Each song is a jem that will get you to hum or sing.  This Pink Floyd / Dead Head has had the cd now since the movie came out and still has not had enough of it.
B00FHEP9XM|5|This keyboard is great. Makes texting a lot faster for me. Although, sometimes it crashes on Android 4.4.2, but that could just be me. It does recommend that you turn off Android's built-in spell checking tool, which is something I haven't done yet. I think I still prefer using Swiftkey, but I am definitely biased (been using Swiftkey for a lot longer time than I have been using Swype). Still, if you are in the market for a keyboard replacement, Swype is definitely one alternative you should take a close look at.
B001TKD4ZI|5|An interesting view on the lives and loves of vampires.  With a good amount of  humor.  Brilliantly written, with stories within stories. Serious enough to bring life to the characters. Laughing through most of the book with realistic occurrence that are very humorous.
B00H71PBQ8|5|I love Downton Abbey
B000O178BY|3|This new NIN album was an unexpected surprise since I had barely heard it was coming out before 'there it was.' Unlike many people I actually enjoyed a lot of With Teeth, With Teeth was a bit more commercial but the songs were creative and well written. To me the biggest problem with Year Zero (and I can appreciate the possible perspective from my being a songwriter as well) is that it seems like it was written to prove a point. Namely Trent began writing the album on a little lap top computer. Somehow to me it sounds like part of the 'challenge' to Trent was to see IF he could program the entire album on computer without using any real time musicians, especially drummers.    Now I know Josh Freese plays on the opening track (really ANYONE could have played that simple beat) but after that the album could have really used a human element, real drums and a real bass as well. So many of the tracks sound like Trent created a techno landscape and then wrote some simple melodies over the top thinking the electronic landscapes were interesting enough.     Unfortunately they're not. Maybe the 'all programmed' tracks were supposed to intentionally show the lack of a human element for the lyrical theme of the music but in the end the performances are just a little too cold and flat.    Musically (compositionally) the songs are too simple and unimaginative, straight beats, straight rhythms, predictable choruses right where you assume they're gonna be. And often the songs sound like he's borrowed musical ideas he already used on With Teeth.    But in the end its still a decent album. And for me often the new music will take on a higher polish when its played live by real players. I just wish NIN could finally record something using  live musicians more.  A new album doesn't in any way negate what an artist has created before and if this is what held Reznor's interest in the last few years more power to him. Hopefully as he perhaps finds out that his fans still support him he'll be willing on the next album to take some bigger and less commercial musical chances with his music. I sense that he has better and more interesting music in him. I'm just waiting for him to let it out!
B00DJFIMW6|5|my niece really really  love this game she plays it all night and day I have to go shut it down or off....
0143143492|5|execellent...life changing, thought provoking. Listen to the cd's more than once. Each time through, I pick on something I missed before.
B00002N9ER|5|Used this to mount on the drivers side seat of my Toyota Tacoma.  Easy install and holds my flashlight perfectly.
B000088E6D|5|You need to know that someone likes the artist, need a reason to give it,  got a great response from recipient
B000FC2L1E|5|This series is the best I have read! The characters are so alive that you can't bear to be away from them when you must pause in reading to attend to daily minutiae. I am hooked and cannot wait to proceed in this amazing journey!
B00FATEJYE|5|This game is jam-packed with cool features and characters.  In my opinion this is one of the best games ever made!!!!
B000LXQVA4|4|This jumparoo is great!  It has lots of different toys and colors for the baby & the seat turns full circle, so she can have her favorite in front of her!  The lights are bright & eye catching & she tries to grab them - which starts her bouncing!  The height of the seat is great & with the stand - it is safe & she can't move it or bump into anything.  The only thing I think could be improved is the seat somehow??? She is 4 months old & it is fine for now but will soon outgrow it.  It seems to be very deep & leg holes seem small making it tricky at times to get her in & out of it.  Other than that - we are both thrilled with it!  It is also important that baby can hold their head up by themself before using it as they lean way back to see toys hanging above them.
B004GJDQT8|4|Great item sourcing
B00KW282MO|2|good actors, lame plot
B007PVHMCG|4|These were delivered on a timely basis and in good shape.  The actual size of the Legos was a surprise as the Legos are very small having 480 pieces of the small Legos.

I can get over having to wait 24 hours between games (unless you pay)... but having to share FB with them so they can advertise my activity is the last straw.  just un-installed it.
B00000AFWZ|5|Nuggets was originally released in 1972 as a double album.  It celebrated the garage rock music of the mid 60's with future Patti Smith guitarist Lenny Kaye providing dead-on liner notes.  The band's featured on the album laid the blueprint for such bands as The New York Dolls, The Stooges and Patti Smith as well as the punk movement.  The songs are no nonsense, crazed out rockers with some psychedelia and dance tracks thrown in.  Rhino Records has done an amazing job expanding the original double album into a four cd set.  Some of the songs like The Kingsmen &quot;Louie, Louie&quot;, Sam The Sham &amp; Pharaoh's &quot;Wooly Bully&quot;, The Outsiders' &quot;Time Wont Let Me&quot;, The Human Beinz propulsive &quot;Nobody But Me&quot;, The Musical Explosion's &quot;Little Bit O' Soul&quot;, The Count Five's &quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot;, The Castaways' &quot;Liar, Liar&quot; were all top ten hits with The Strawberry Alarm Clock's &quot;Incense &amp; Peppermint&quot; going all the way to number one.  For the most part, the collection is made up of obscure songs that were minor national hits and regional hits around the country.  Songs like The Cryan Shames' searing &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot;, The Barbarians' earnest &quot;Moulty&quot;, The Lollipop Shoppe's pulsating &quot;You Must Be A Witch&quot;, The Sonics' &quot;Strychnine&quot;, Kim Fowley's spooky &quot;The Trip&quot;, Rare Breed's (who became American Breed and scored a top ten hit with Bend Me, Shape Me) r&amp;b flavored &quot;Beg, Borrow &amp; Steal&quot;, Richard &amp; The Young Lions' stellar &quot;Open Up Your Door&quot;, The Bees' buzzing &quot;Voices Green &amp; Purple&quot; and The Palace Guards' bubble gummy &quot;Falling Sugar&quot; are all basically unknowns.  But they all show an immense amount of heart and soul and the classic three chords and a dream philosophy of most bands out there.  Some well known bands show up with some lesser known hits like The Turtles, Captain Beefheart and Paul Revere &amp; The Raiders whose &quot;Just Like Me&quot; is an absolute rave-up.  Some famous artists appear in their first or lesser known groups like Todd Rundgren with The Nazz on &quot;Open Our Eyes, Ted Nugent on two songs from The Amboy Dukes, ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons with The 13th Floor Elevators and Creedence Clearwater Revival shows up under their original moniker, The Golliwogs, with the chooglin &quot;Fight Fire&quot;.  Other great songs include some semi-famous tracks like the frat rock classics &quot;Double Shot (Of My Baby's Love&quot; by The Swinging Medallions and The Premiers &quot;Farmer John&quot;, The Standells' &quot;Dirty Water&quot;, The Strangeloves &quot;I Want Candy&quot; which Bow Wow Wow would turn into a new wave staple, Love's influential &quot;7 And 7 Is&quot; and the Tex-ex stylings of The Hombres' &quot;Let It Out (Let It All Hang Out)&quot;.

B00V88YDUG|5|This album is so awesome! Till in all English and covered in humor. I am absolutely in love with Till! He is amazing. This album, his independent works, are incredible! I was at a Rammstein concert a couple years ago and shared an incredible few moments with him while they performed &#34;ohne dich&#34;. At the end of the song he unscrewed the microphone top and dropped it down to me. Now I am convinced that &#34;FAT&#34;, my favorite song on this album, is about me and that he dreams of me as I dream of him. I just love it all. The book is incredible. 88 pages, full color. Large coffee table style. Come in a box. Great for my collection! I purchased this with my own money, please do not remove my review!
B009LDD1X0|5|Like everyone has said, this is possibly the best show ever. Many here have compared it to Seinfeld. I was not a Seinfeld fan, (I watched it a few times in reruns) and really don't see the similarity. To me the Seinfeld characters didn't have any focus. Back to BBT, sometimes Sheldon gets on my nerves, he is just such an egomaniac. How he thinks he is the center of the universe. That shows what a great actor Jim Parsons is. Makes me want to write the show, and tell them to have Leonard or one of the others take him down a peg or two. You can see how Leonard gets so frustrated with him.
B0094BB4TW|4|Love it but have trouble with my tablet saving my password.  Have to change it even though am POSITIVE it is correct.
B00KA7JIII|5|Artwork is beautiful and the way it moves to challenge you is amazing. Perception is very important.  Enjoyed it so much, bought the additional levels for  $1.99
0810971089|5|Even non readers will enjoy it. My daughter likes them, yes its a good book for girls also.
0064430227|5|I brought home 10 books from the library tonight, and both of my kids (twins, age 3) fought over this book.  It is the oldest and smallest of all of the books I brought home, reminding me that this is a classic for a reason!  They liked the small size, because they both hold their books facing outward, the way I do when I read to them.    I honestly cannot say what they liked the most about this book, because my favorite was \\"I Love You, Stinky Face.\\"  But this book was like a magnet to them; they instantly took to it.
B00BRUPICM|5|Couldn't put it down. Want to read everything he writes. Lots of plot twists. Just wonderful. Great characters. Always unexpected.
B0054JZC6E|5|this qame is awesomee and supper adictinq I love love love love love love love it so friqqin much I cant put my kindle down!
B00HYTSTNU|4|I avoided seeing this at theater when it first came out. I assumed it would be a predictable story since it was in the news a few years back; good guys/bad guys, bad guys get shot. I was wrong. This movie was thoughtfully done.
B00CHIMG6Y|5|I thought this was a great story of overcoming the impossible. It was amazing how it all came together. Well worth the time to see.
B0058UXHHK|5|I liked the main characters and found myself chuckling over Rose's quirkiness and sarcasm.  Joe is a complex character still evolving at the end of the novel.  I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.
B006885LZM|5|Very emotional and well-written....I loved this series and will definitely watch it again. Coming from a military family and hearing all of the stories of WWII, I'm so glad that Tom Hanks & Spielberg did this series. As I've gotten older, I crave to understand and learn more about our history, especially since I have 3 grandfather who have fought & served. It sure feels like we're getting so far away from those times.... and morals.
B00275EHJG|5|I finished watching Toy Story 3 and although I still have not seen the first two Toy Story films, I felt that the action and lessons learned were powerfully portrayed, but missing the adult themes and nostalgia that I enjoyed with Wall-E and Up.<br /><br />The film starts out with a short, \\"Day & Night\\" which I thought was fun.  Both Day and Night have their pros and cons which we see.  Ah the nightlife of Vegas!  Ah, the beach girls in summer!<br /><br />Many years ago, most films had a cartoon and a newsreel before starting the main picture.  In fact, there were these things called \\"double features\\" which you don't see too much of, which had two films playing for a single admission price.  Good old days.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the main event:  Andy's toys are being boxed up and he's on his way to college.  Through an accident, most of Andy's toys almost get trashed (to a toy, being trashed is the same as hell!).  Thanks to some of Woody's (cowboy toy) actions they escape only to end up in Sunnydale, a preschool that has the apparency of lots of kids playing with toys, to being beaten up and busted apart by little children!<br /><br />The toys are not happy with being treated like hammers and paint brushes and want to be played with.  Too bad says \\"Lotso\\", a large, toy bear who is literally a dictator running the toy show at the preschool.<br /><br />I came away from the movie with the idea that there are several ways to handle rejection.  Some of the toys, like Lotso, handled rejection by becoming bitter and treating others badly.  He came up with the false idea that \\"everyone\\" treats toys like hand-me-downs, that they can easily be replaced, and that they are not appreciated and will eventually be trashed.<br /><br />Andy's toys however deal with rejection in a different way.  They too feel that they are being rejected and trashed.  But they also understand that Andy is growing up and no longer has a need for toys.  They're not too keen with ending up in the attic storage but at least they won't be trashed.  But these toys are flexible:  All they want is to be played with.<br /><br />Finally, Woody is not too keen on being trashed either.  But he wants to maintain status quo.  He feels that they all belong to Andy and should be loyal to him.<br /><br />All three groups have an epiphany of sorts.  Some adapt and well, some just don't change and end up on the wrong side of (something) (no spoilers, sorry!).<br /><br />There are some scenes that might be a bit intense for smaller kids, but I think Pixar earned its five stars because of what it created here has a story lesson, is not knocking you upside the head with its moral lessons, has some conflict and resolution and is fun to watch.<br /><br />For me, not as charming and fun as Wall-E or Up, but still highly recommended for the kids in your life.e trashed.

B0058EBNAO|5|I think this is a terrific app. I've tried several different weather apps and this is my favorite.  Very user friendly and I think the display is quite pleasing.  Lots of information about weather conditions.
B003UYUP58|5|Having been touched  recently by two incidents of cancer in my family, I began to read this book nearly three years ago. I have found it to be compelling in its information and very well written. The author has a gift for telling a story--almost like reading a compelling novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to know about the 4000 year journey to find ways to treat cancer.
B002VPE1AW|1|I have not recieved this item yet.  My money has been taken out off my account but not record of where product is.  Not very happy about this with this being my first time buying off of amazon.  Not planning on buying anything in the future.
B00263HWM8|2|When you watch a popcorn movie, you have to have a high suspension of disbelief.  Okay, gadgets like that exist and work great.  Okay, a person can take a massive beating and still have enough strength to win a fight.  But there has to be something about the plot that makes sense.  I found myself right off the bat saying, &#34;Oh, come on!&#34; The preposterous plot, along with some dreadful dialog gives the actors very little to work with.  This is coming from a person who loved M:I-1 and M:I-3.
B000QCQ970|5|Josh has lived several lifetimes in the 29 years of this book. His lessons are timeless and can be applied to mastering any subject
B00BQPEIT2|5|This is a really awesome game. The graphics are really good on the nexus 7. I am happy that this game was only .99 cents.
B000E1YVZU|5|Highly recommended, almost as great as the stage production.  A must have for the lover of the arts.  Bonus DVD has great background information on the writer and his inspiration for the show.
B004LM72ZY|5|durable and fun
B0051ANPZQ|4|There were many things I liked about this story. Mostly the way it dealt with discrimination and the fact that kids are often more considerate and understanding than adults. Taking away the understanding that we all need to be kinder to each other to create a better world.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I like the surprise you get when you get a prize so far I  have got 3 characters it is like floppy bird but in a different way it is fun to play when bored
B003YVLC18|5|Most excellent movie.  Great for the entire family.
B007PT3QOQ|5|I love it!!!  It reminds me of school when I was little. We played the original as a contest within our class.
B00MHT49KO|5|This is just like any other Ghibli studio movie. Very great animation and a lovely story to go along with it. It is fairly long, but it is another movie that will get stuck in your memory.
B00AIQP9DE|5|Really good game.  The graphics are exceptional and it has a real story line (a pleasure lately).  Thanks again to G5.
B004HXIZVC|5|Nice
B004MC8CA2|4|I particularly enjoy this Bible app because of the powerful narrations of the NIV and KJV . However... I am still waiting for the Saint Ignatious Bible translation to become available and perhaps the Septuagent.
B000002KXO|4|While not the best Fleetwood Mac album, it still has some of the Mac's finest songs. Stevie's &quot;Gypsy&quot; is the best song on the album, and one of Fleetwood Mac's greatest.  Christine McVie still has the catchiest  songs.  &quot;Hold Me&quot; &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Love  in Store&quot; are classic McVie.  And Lindsey's &quot;Book of Love&quot;  sounds great.
B008ZOHCKE|5|Easy to use, and very handing for appointments and other uses..Thank You I would recommend this notebook to other people.
B000OT8GCQ|5|Very pleased with the book and the service.
B002ZG98FU|5|If you want a feel-good movie (with talent providing the feel-good), don't miss this movie!  It's not often I give a perfect rating to a movie, but no hesitation here.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Great evening of viewing!
1593974256|5|This product arrived shrinkwrapped and in perfect condition.  I couldn't have asked for anything better at such a great price.
B000GCFG7E|5|Love the Reacher books!
B004C03TJ8|3|Had always heard about this movie and I wanted to see for myself. It wasn't quite as thrilling as I had hoped it would be. Many, many superb Disney movies have been produced after this one.
B00HERGM86|3|I love the first Thor movie, So I paided 30.00 dollars day one for part 2 , what a mistake should of rent it.....average movie
B00DUGCLY4|5|this game is pretty fun it challenges your brain to think outside of the box. I would definately reccommend it
B003PJ6UHA|5|This book's provocative ideas drew me to it, but the beautiful storytelling kept me interested. It truly changed the way I see our universe and our place in it.
B00GIZO674|5|Thank you for coming to the Amazon app store. I can play this game for hours.  Plays very well on my Kindle HD.

B000K7VHQE|5|Little Miss Sunshine si one of the best comedies of 2006. It follows the journey of thsi very dysfunctional family as it travels to California in an old yellow Volkswagon van. This film has a variety of different characters with each of them having a personality of their own. There's the anal father who just wants his kids to be winners. (He wont' stand for them being losers, probably becasue he is somewhat of a loser himself). THe foul-mouthed grandfather, played by Alan Arkin, and the teenage son who refuses to speak until he gets into flying school. Oh yes, he also hates everyone. It has a smartly written script that is clever and original with some very funny moments in it. I found Little Miss Sunshine to be one of the best comedies of 2006. It is a real pleasure.
0142002038|5|As most teenagers, I had my &quot;Bond movies phase&quot;, renting and watching every movie from Sean Connery through Lazenby, Moore, Dalton and now Brosnan. Even so, I had never read one of Ian Fleming's books, prejudicialy dismissing them as childish and poorly written. After ten years, I found &quot;Doctor No&quot; in a used-books store, and since I made the mistake of thinking this was, like in the movies, the first book of the series, I bought it.<br />In &quot;Doctor No&quot;, James Bond, after a bad mission and spending some time in a hospital, is given a kind of &quot;vacation mission&quot; in Jamaica. He has to discover what happened to the local stationed british secret agent, who is reported missing. When Bond gets there, he is driven towards Crab Key, a misterious island owned by Julius No, a tall, bald maniac for privacy and who is hiding things from jamaican administration.<br />To my surprise (and showing I was wrong in my prejudices), Fleming is a good writer who can hold the reader's attention at most times. It's just a pity that I didn't begin the series with the first book, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, to see how Fleming developed his writing style, characters and plots while writing the books.<br />Other surprise was to compare Bond in the books with Bond in the movies. Bond in the books was more human and credible, even to the point of throwing up after moments of extreme tension. Other characters are interesting as well, like nature girl Honey Rider and Bond's friend Quarrell. I also liked to meet again characters like M and Q. Doctor No, though, as everything related to Crab Key island, is a little too fantastic for my taste, but, from the information I gathered, &quot;Doctor No&quot; is Fleming's most &quot;exotic&quot; and implausible book.<br />The important considerations are that Fleming can create good thrilling scenes, and that James Bond is a better character than I expected. I will surely look for &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and start the series in proper order.<br />Grade 8.8/10e series in proper order. <br />Grade 8.8/10
B00005J6T0|5|And after recently hearing 'Holiday' (that song is not on this album) on the radio decided that I needed to purchase all my old Madonna that I owned in either record or cassette tape form in cd form. So glad I did. I forgot how totally awesome this album was. The whole album! If you love Madonna or just love 80's pop you should purcase True Blue.
B005IQZB14|5|This book came to me in a very good time, it inspired me and helped me go through a rough time.
B005S9EKCW|5|Liked the stage version, Like the Movie.  Although some of the music on the movie didn't thrill me as much as the Stage version did.  Some parts are completely missing from this version, for example, toward the end, when Jon is dieing, and the girls are singing together on Stage, only mom sings in the movie version.  I miss the harmony of all three girls singing.
0792163710|5|I remember this movie, when it came to the theaters.  I was just a kid at that time, when Roy Rogers, Gene Autry & all of the other Cowboy Idols were still popular.  It is definitely a Classic among the Westerns.  If you enjoy Westerns & collect the movies, this one should be part of your collection.  Also, Westerns in color were a premium treat back then.
B002P79KAC|5|Big Bang Theory is always gives me a good laugh. I love the show. The second season did not disappoint.
B00D3V5V7U|4|This album, while it lacks some of the original creative spark of old Black Sabbath, it certainly carries on the legacy of heavy rhythm and dark pensive lyrics. A good work from the Godfathers and founders of Heavy Metal
B009AMAJPA|5|This movie surprised me because I did not expect it to be so well acted and the scenes to be so well made.<br /><br />It is basically about a Man and Woman with scars who by helping each other help themselves.<br /><br />I highly recommend you give it a look.
B00886XQO0|5|This really upped my Cod game, works great for other titles also.  I've been having issues with deteriorating battery life recently.
B004GHNIRK|5|I never thought I would finish the  book. HUGO's language so formal, French words or phrases I did not know. Sometimes the word was so ancient it was not in the dictionary. I know the story from the musicals on stage, and movies. But here I am at the end.  Mr. HUGO GRABBED me with his eloquence and did not let go. I especially loved his description of the transitions from the Dark ages to enlightenment, starting with Napoleon loosing Waterloo. The universe felt it was time to change from despots to democrats. How ageless. We struggle today with the same issue moving forward some but so far to travel to reach the goal.
B005MMY9A8|5|I've been a Thor fan since childhood comic days. This movie did a great job on keeping my perception of Thor alive. He's powerful, yet unmistakably human with all the complexities that come with that combination. It got a little surreal in a few spots, but hey, this is  a movie about the gods we're talkin' about here.
B00ECR7KX2|3|Does not quite give me the real &#34;English &#34; feeling.Have seen the &#34;proper&#34; version and this is the &#34;light&#34; version<br />I missed more flow  in the whole production.The cast and crew had a difficult task,and all in all they did a ok job with what they had.
B0091WNK8M|5|Over 20 years old but still a great movie.  All three of my children aged 7, 8, and 9 loved it.
067182449X|5|I read this book in the 9th grade of high school my final grade of the year and it was great. I found out that it was being sold on amazon.com. I bought this book and read it all over again and really got the whole idea of what Anne Frank went through. She and her family had to go into hiding so that Anne or her sister and her mother would not be captured by the Nazi's and taking to the concentration camps. Anne and her family were living in a 2 room hiding spae along with another family. I some parts of the book were very tearful and other parts would make you think, Thank God this was not me back then and the sad part is, when  Anne Frnak was released from hiding she died 2 months later. This book gave you an inside idea what is was like back then. This book is a must read book. Everyone that buys this book, it not money wasted. I will be the best amount of money spent on a book. I am glad that I bought this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Fun stuff!
B007IK44CK|5|This movie was very entertaining. Tom cruise is a wonderful actor. I thought there was plenty of action in this movie. The only thing I did not like in the movie was that they revealed to much of womens cleavage.
B000LXHK2C|5|Great movie, but I wish there was a blue ray version.
B00632HWOG|3|I have Yahoo Mail on my desktop but ended up deleting it from my Kindle, it didn't seem to work as well as what I already had to read my mail.
B00QR7ZM8A|5|I listen to this over and over. The songs hark back to slower, simpler, more romantic times. Dylan's interpretations bring the lyrics into focus. He's still got that old magic.
B00IUBM8PQ|5|The story line was very interesting! It seems as if &#34;great&#34; movies are far and few between.  This one was a hit!
B00004XPOZ|5|After seeing the original and special edition Star Wars Trilogy, I can honestly say that this is probably going to be the best version of them  all, and with widescreen to see more of the movies'. As if the Trilogy  wasn't enough, Lucas Films has put 10 minutes of Episode 2 which should  make all Star Wars fan love this version of the movies than the others made  before it. Though I haven't seen it yet, I'm sure it deserves 5 stars and  that this is a movie made for everybody.

B00HXYKYIE|4|Truly well written and this author does not disappoint.  I did not become lost in the chapters or the characters and I certainly am a fan of the paranormal.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B000002UJQ|5|I just thought this cd was great.  At first, only karma police appealed to  me because I heard it so much, but the whole cd grew on me.  To tell the  truth, I only bought the cd because of the grammy hype and what my friends  said, but I can know honestly say that OK Computer is my favorite cd, by  far.  I just listen to every song and never get bored.
B009RH9HDS|4|I love the color .  I got the Orange to match the word fire.<br />Do not like that it slips out of the case easy. I do like the elastic to keep the case closed.
B0017SWPXY|5|Garth Stein is truly a great storyteller and this novel doesn't disappoint. From a dog's perspective, you hear a story that will take you up and down the emotional scale with heartbreak and happiness, triumph and tragedy.  You will feel the excitement and exhilaration of blazing around a race track as well as the heartache and emptiness when confronted by the loss of loved ones.  Besides enjoying a good read, I developed a greater love for my own dog, who is actually much like Enzo.

B00KK0PICK|5|Very well written book. It all just makes sense. Looking forward to tackling my house and belongings- I have way too much stuff
B00EMJBVAI|2|so so movie.  not really into zombie movies.<br />i have seen better.<br />movie was kind of long and boring.<br />eh
B00TU9UO1W|4|The story is great!<br />Really.<br />The science for what we understand right now, is correct. The theory they work with, may just be spot-on. The soundtrack fantastic! Acting was good. The special effects were wonderful. And on a big screen, you won't be able to tune out the movie! It will have you falling into the screen as if you were a part of the events. Not many movies can do this. And the fact of how they cover so much, but don't miss a beat, shows careful forethought in production. But, to extrapolate a possible future that hits home, well that is equally scary.<br />However, they could have left the &#34;ghostbuster&#34; part of the storyline out. Another method may have been far better, and closer to the &#34;science fiction&#34; genre they were writing within.<br />However, that said, the bottom line is the ending. It doesn't end. Oh they resolve the big issues, but they don't really wrap-up the story with all the main characters. I hate movies that do that! I want to SEE the ending, not hint at what most likely will be.  So, if you don't want to be left hanging with a certain level of irritation. Don't view this. However, if you need to watch it, don't buy it. Just rent it. Then decide for yourself if you really want to add this to your library of films. It has a lot to offer. So do  not get me wrong. But why did they not add a just a few minutes to wrap this movie up correctly? Shorten the credits, or speed them up like some movies do.<br />I cannot see how they could make a sequel.
B003IPC5SO|4|Kylie is back to the dance floor full force.  This cd is her best since Fever.  There is not a track that won't get you moving to the beat.  If you wanna dance all night, put this disc in your cd player, you won't regret it.

0679805273|5|Love this book.
B0026KX5PO|3|too slow. All the actors were good in the parts and it was a good plot line it just moved to slow.
B004W2UBYW|5|A book written by a genius, about another genius. This is a fantastic, engrossing, illuminating, surprising read.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this book
B004LWZW4C|1|First I have to say that getting the Bluray to play is hit or miss depending on the bluray drive. Secondly, the digital copy has been all MISS for me. I can't get it to play on an HD2 nor on a Samsung Infuse, neither in the Apple (mp4) nor Windows (wmv) formats.    Don't make 'digital copy' a marketing point if it's only going to work some of the time.

B00KQWZ3HW|5|Great song with a lot of punch and compression. Wall of sound.

Surf the pages and soak up what makes sense to you. I can assure you that you will pick up something that will change the way you operate. I can say that I am much more productive, producing better results at work and spending less time doing it. Furthermore I am spending more time with my family.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0040I09RM|5|Love the series. Great music. Not enough space to stress how great the show is.
B000A2WNB2|3|Don't get me wrong, I *love* Muse.  But I am frustrated by the listing saying \\"All Regions\\".  The item description says \\"All Regions\\" but I just tried this in my USA-bought Sony PS3 to upscale the signal, but the screen comes up \\"'PAL' not supported\\" (!!).  Now, on my computer the DVD-disc-1 is playing, with the 'canned' software that came with my Windows-Dell laptop, so that's OK I guess.  But not the same as having it run through the PS3 and the sound system+big screen tv, right?  Maybe I am the blind one and should have read more of the reviews, but I wished this had been REALLY CLEAR in the item description.  Buyer beware, which makes me very sad because I &lt;3 Muse!  :{
B0012QVJXS|3|I once thought the Superman movie was pretty good -- and maybe it's just been a few too many years from the time I originally saw the movie -- but now, it's a bit dated and corny. The films starts out well enough, but soon degrades into a silly love story between the &#34;Man of Steel&#34; and Lois Lane.  Oh well, just call me &#34;jaded&#34;!!
B001NFNFIK|4|I consider, 'In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead,' released in 1993, some of the best of Burke---and his character, Robicheaux. I had the opportunity to listen to the book, way back then, on tape.  Now this was not the 'usual' audio book.  It was complete with eerie sound effects and so expertly done, that my family camped out in the living room, turned out all the lights and we made an evening out of this extraordinary tale.<br /><br />While I don't believe this movie adaptation, 'In the Electric Mist, holds a candle to that first experience, it still provided a great visit, with characters that I came to love, over a decade and a half ago. It was this previous introduction that turned me on to Burke and destined me to become a loyal, forever fan.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I've always rather envisioned Robicheaux's character to look something like the dark, craggy, and grumpy, Kinky Friedman. And in real life, he rather does. However, if given a list of potential actors, I would have placed Tommy Lee Jones on the short list, for some of the same physical characteristics. I was able to completely identify him with the role, although I could have used a tad more accent.<br /><br />Robicheaux is an alcoholic, struggling to stay in remission, with many skeletons in his closet, including witnessing a black man being gunned down in the swamps, many years previously---something he chose to remain silent about.  He can no longer remain in denial, when a member of a filming crew working in the swamps, comes across the bones.  In the midst of this event, grizzly murders of prostitutes begin to take place---murders he would love to pin on his sleazy nemesis, the mobster, played by John Goodman.<br /><br />The character who plays Robicheaux's daughter, Alafair, provides some nail-biting moments toward the end of the movie, as well. To digress, I've always loved the way Burke's real daughter is named Alafair and the way he sets up such a bond between Alafair and Robicheaux, in all of his work. I find this sweet and endearing.<br /><br />As Robicheaux begins his investigations, he has hallucinogenic encounters with a troop of Confederate Soldiers, under the famous John Bell Hood. Hood becomes Robicheaux's ghostly sub-conscience, offering insights into seeking and finding truth---an all knowing wisdom, from the grave.<br /><br />The movie is not high on budget and in some respects, it looks almost like a made for TV drama.  However, they still managed to capture the mysterious Cajun atmosphere, making you feel you might just have to start swatting skeeters. I wish there had been more development of the supernatural aspects---the war, the soldiers.  In the book and audio version, this was hair-raisingly spooky, but not so much in this movie.<br /><br />There were a couple of superficial mentions of Katrina, bringing us more up to the moment with Louisiana, which felt a little out of place, because we were dealing with another place and time, with the original story.  Besides, Burke's 'The Tin Roof Blowdown,' is where he excels in describing his beloved New Orleans, post Katrina.<br /><br />I agree, you don't have to have read the book to enjoy this mystery/drama. There's plenty of suspense, reminders of the devastation of war, prejudice and corruption.  It's also contemplative, ensuring we can't run from our demons; that anesthesia through alcohol, won't extinguish the omission of truth, or responsibility.work. I find this sweet and endearing.

B0071XO8RA|4|this was a great story . it started slow with background and imagry then it took off with action and a unexpected ending ....i loved it
B00BAYLQI0|4|True story.  Holds your interest, but you know how it is going to end so there is no mystery.  Well acted, the natural disaster effects were realistic looking, pretty well done.
0307887898|1|Borrowed this book from the library after a Senior Mngr recommended it. It also had some pretty high ratings on Amazon also.<br /><br />Introduction was well written and easy to read but the real contents of the book aren't. It's almost as though they're written by two different people. Like most of the other reviews of this book there is a lot of fluff and verbal dribble. From about chapter 2 I started skim reading as there was just too much bs without any real content. After finishing chapter 3 which was more of the same I had a closer look at the Amazon reviews and realized a lot of other reviews have had similar feedback.<br /><br />I'm glad I came here instead of wasting time and energy reading the book.
B00HDMMISA|4|I had a hard time putting this book down, it was a fun read even though at the end there was food for reflection. I would suggest this read to anyone.
B00HVOGHO6|3|A great cast and they turned in some terrific moments.  The basic story was excellent.  Pretty much everything else was seriously lame meaning the director's immediate work and all his presumed lines of responsibility.  The movie was awkward, poorly paced, poorly edited, and made awful use of some great music.  My sense was that this an effort at a Coen brothers take on Scorsese; it did not work.  I felt like the music choices were self-consciously quirky, and they were a disruption to a film that was always struggling to find a rhythm.

B00H7EV49S|4|Having collected the 10 APP Studio albums/original CDs from around 1986 to 1989, I remember being less than impressed at the sound quality on a few of the titles. 'Pyramid' and 'Eve' in particular were thin with no real bottom end, and had low volume compared to later releases like 'Eye' and 'Gaudi'. 'Stereotomy suffered from very tinny/sharp/clipped drums. Alan did a great job with the 'Tales' remaster, and I just never got around to buying the single disc remasters late last decade. So, when this box set became available I was ready to pounce. And I'm glad I pre-ordered and got it for around $67 before it skyrocketed to over $100. The improved sound quality alone vs. the 80s issues alone gets 5 stars.<br /><br />The packaging, while well done in appearance, doesn't stand up to scrutiny. I've only taken each disc out once, and can tell that the glued seams (especailly at the top glued edge) are going to separate with very little use. And while I appreciate the faithful album sleeve reproductions, the printed lyrics on some of the jackets are a joke (I'm looking at you, 'Eve', 'Turn of a Friendly Card' and 'Stereotomy). Would have been nice to use the booklet to reprint all of the lyrics at a reasonable font size, since, with the faithful jacket reproductions, we don't get ANY lyric sheet on albums that originally had them printed on the inner sleeves. Packaging gets 4 stars.<br /><br />The new kid on the block, ' The Sicilian Defense,' was an interesting listen. A lot of it sounded like the soundtrack for the original TRON movie. A couple of the piano pieces were nice, and I could see floating a couple of those into some eclectic playlist, but overall, I don't think I'll revisit the whole album in its entirety again. It's a nice-to-have as an oddity, but not groundbreaking. It gets 3 stars, which brings the whole average to 4.<br /><br />This set is certainly worth buying if you only have the original 80s CDs and want a great sonic upgrade. If you bought the remasters of a few years ago, it probably isn't worth the purchase just to get 'The Sicilian Defense.'ers of a few years ago, it probably isn't worth the purchase just to get 'The Sicilian Defense.'
0385510454|1|I was very disappointed in this book.  I'm a big fan of Grisham's earlier books and had hoped The Broker would be as exciting.  I kept reading and reading and reading, waiting for something to happen.  I thought, surely the ending will bring it all together - wrong!  What ending???  Read this book if you want a vivid description of Bolonga, Italy and Italian language lessons.
B00M25EALG|5|Loved it
B005DD7TI0|4|I liked the movie more than I thought I would.  It was a bit of sci-fi and adventure - I enjoyed the movie and recommend it.
B00EMXBDMA|5|I loved Mark Watney as the main character. He was so level headed and resourceful. The book kept me on the edge of my seat, had me in tears and had me smiling throughout.

0780624890|1|What can I say? this movie is one of the most horrible I have ever watched, I wish I could have given it -5 stars, and its not even worth it to say why I hate it.

MOBY IS EXCELLENT, MY FAVORITE CUT SO FAR IS &quot;FIND MY BABY&quot; IT'S SOOOOOO COOL. &quot;PORCELAIN&quot; AND  &quot;WHY DOES MY HEART FEEL SO BAD&quot; ARE ALSO GOOD TRACKS. I LOVE THE  ATMOSPHERIC FEEL OF &quot;PORCELAIN&quot; IT REMINDS OF YES AND ELO FROM MY  YOUTH. IF YOU ACTUALLY LIKE MUSIC WITH SOUL BUY IT  NOW!  P.S. SORRY ABOUT THE  SPELLING.
1451629192|1|I bought the book for my mother as a birthday gift. She wanted the book so bad! Thought the book was good until I got about half way through it and realized that it was repeating itself?? Around page 60 it started over at page 20 something and then you couldn't read the story again until page 90 something. Idk if this was a publishing issue or why the book had 15-20 of the same pages in there twice, but I wasnt happy. The book was totally screwed and it was quite upsetting.

B004EPZ0AC|1|This movie was soooo horrible. I can't believe how much of a waste of money it was going to see it. Save your money!!
B00L9B7IKE|1|I had a difficult time finishing this book. It's written as a mystery, and that is the only reason I finished the book-to find out the ending. For me, I found it impossible to like the lead character, Rachel. I couldn't feel sorry for her, couldn't feel any empathy for her, nor did I care about her as I read along. I even felt that way at the end. This is very unusual for me. I found it depressing, and I dis-liked Rachel so much, that I almost put the book down numerous times. It was almost irritating to read about her. This book has been compared to Lost Girl. I can't see it at all. Most of the characters in this book are so miserable, that it was almost painful for me to continue reading. I felt it was a waste of my time, and am glad I didn't recommend it for my book club.
B00846F1YW|3|Very frustrating when objects are behind the border! Some shapes are extremely vague making it difficult to see what it is. The author really missed a great chance to reward the player by actually using the solved puzzles to progress the game.<br /><br />This is my first time with a game like this. I am about 3/4 of the way through.
B00000099Y|5|Thats what this is. Out of the four Tool Albums released thus far, This one is the greatest. The Hardest. The Angriest. Most importantly the most experimental. All these other reviews are great but Ill just sum it down. Buy this album. Anyone can appreciate it. I mean. Im not just a rabid person who rates everything with five stars either. look at my other reviews. the only other one to get five stars is Snots &quot;Get Some&quot; so...dont take my lightly when I tell you to buy this album....now.
B00HDMMISA|4|This author is like that one friend that you have that talks too much and is kind of annoying but she is so fun you just put up with her.  That's how I feel about this author's writing.  She goes on and on when she doesn't need to but it's annoying but fun at the same time.  This book is really good.  I got so caught up in all the characters and as I would read the book...I found the time would fly by and I was sad when I finished it.  The characters were so real to me.
B0002V7O3S|5|whether you believe in alien abductions or not..this is a great film that you should check out for its great story and intense atmoshere, robert patrick is very good in this movie along with sweeney and garner
B008JGSM6G|5|its sooooo fun i could play it all day it is soooo fun and challenging :) :)just got it on my iphone
B00D7Z4GQY|3|Well-developed interesting characters.
B0044XV3QY|3|I love love love this movie soooo much. It is fantastic. The movie would get a 5 star but the idea of the Family Audio version is the reason for the 3 star rating.  I was super excited that this set came with a DVD that had a \\"Family Audio\\" version with what they call and this is quoted from right on the box...\\"ALL objectionable language removed.\\" So I guess objectionable is relative.?? Because they did a fantastic job editing the really bad stuff, I was impressed (3 stars for that), but Hell's and Damn's are in there and when you sit down with your family expecting that ALL objectionable language was removed, and they say...hey that's a bad word and hey they left that one in. I was hoping for better when the box promoted ALL. I am disappointed that those words weren't deemed objectionable on the Family version. So this review is for others so they know that there are a \\"few\\" words that are in there. But still a fantastic movie.
B002VPE1AM|5|AVATAR will blow your mind.  See it in IMAX if at all possible; if not, opt for 3-D, but do not see the 2-D.  You need to experience this movie as a viscerally as possible.  At once a corny diatribe against war-mongering, and a not-so-subtle cry for \\"greenery\\" (aka WALL-E), this is so much more than a movie.  AVATAR transcends whatever your expectation might be - based on the somewhat baffling, weird previews, and based on your collective knowledge of James Cameron's showmanship at the movies (kickass movies that linger - and hold up! - but each with a distinctive look, and YES, heart!) The heartbeat of this wildly conceived story is what will make you remember it.  The palpable love story between the two lead characters, as well as the story of one soul's salvation from certain doom, are the things that make this Pocahontas-Jurassic Park-Aliens adventure work so brilliantly.  I've already said too much - you need to SEE this thing to believe it, and trust me - you WILL.
B00BD99JMW|5|Phenomenal book. It was gravitational, up one moment, down the next. To my surprise, it left me smiling. Hopeful, much like the characters at the close of the last chapter. A brilliant series!
B00FKF0F3C|1|It develops confusingly. I could not the jist for a while. Not one ofhis good books<br />Read Noah Gordon.
1594632383|4|I found the book slightly difficult in that a number of stories are woven through it and you have to figure out as you read which of the characters is telling the story in that particular part.  The chapters are not numbered and the narrators are not named as one would expect.  The book feels very incomplete as though there are a few ideas for novels thrown together, even if the people in the book do touch each other's lives.  People do go in and out of our lives, and sometimes, we never get to know what becomes of them.<br />The characters are flat.  And yet, they and their stories kept reminding me of similar events and people in my own life.  Like at the end of the book when Abdullah strikes out at Pari and wants her thrown out because he doesn't know who she is or that she is not stealing his pills.  When my Aunt Harriet had Alzheimer's, my sister went to visit her and Harriet wanted to call the police to tell them that a strange woman had broken into her house.  The book was full of &#34;events&#34; like that, and I was crying almost too hard to read by the end of the book.<br />It hurt to have no resolution to the story of Abdullah's brother and his son.  That made me think of how many people have their homes, possessions, loved ones and even their own lives taken from them by people who are greedy and have no respect for life or God.  Not only in Afghanistan but everywhere in the world throughout human history.  The murders and betrayals in the book were terribly upsetting and disheartening to read, but they go on and on all around us in the real world, and we go on and keep drinking our coffee and hearing about them in the news and never putting an end to the worst of human behavior and to the nightmare that life is for so much of humanity.  Like the character Adel, we recognize the evil in people, but we too often just go with the flow because it is so much easier and safer than trying to row against the stream.<br />The book itself is like a poem, not because it is poetic in a literary sense but rather because it evokes one's emotions like a song does.  Not a happy song, but one that helps you discover some truths about who you are.

I saw him in concert last year and loved it, but wondered if his creative time had ended, since the concert was a direct take from his \\"Essentials\\" album, although being in the South (Atlanta) he didn't perform 'Democracy'.  But this album proves me wrong.  If you like the darker side of Cohen, buy this CD.

0802473156|3|This is a great book to explain the different types of love languages. It's important to know how you love and how you want to be loved. It's a great discussion book for you and your partner. It is written a bit simply and I passed over a lot of the examples as I found they dragged out. However, the basic content is all you need.
B007HACDLK|5|Very good read action packed, typical Mitch Rapp shoot em up interesting plot twist and worthy of 5 stars can't wait for the next Mitch Rapp novel no let down here!
B002SRQ214|5|excelent
B0051UP5NQ|5|I have only had the app for a week but it has worked great.  Love the all the features and is just like using microsoft office.  Use on Samsung Galaxy Note (tablet) 2013.
B00HERGNR6|5|Great movie!  My husband makes me watch all of these comics movies and I love this one the best.....an actual storyline and romance!
B00HDMMISA|4|Big Little Lies is an excellent book.  It was one of those that I could not put down, a abolute page turner.  Actually did not have it figured out until the end and then the way it happened was a total shock.  Loved the way she brought in the children and the adults. It involved so may different people in so many different situations in their lives. I plan to read everything else that this author has written.
B0017KIBAI|4|i do agree with the other review's it is a really good controller i have 2 of thim but for thos who payed 30-40 bucks for it should have shoped a lil longer the same controller is at a stor called family doller for 10 bucks 11.50 tax and all but like i sead it is a really good controller not hade any probloms out of it anyways thanks for reading this just trying to save some ppl some money
B004SH40BQ|5|Now my Ipod is now wireless!
B007T8BYWE|4|I've been playing this game for a few days now and I really enjoy it. It's hard enough to hold your interest  but not to the point where you get frustrated and give up. I recommend this game to all my friends.
B00I75EROU|4|Joyland kept my interest. It was a really good book . sad at times but joyful at times.that Stephen King is a busy guy.
B00BAXFECK|5|I loved her writing.  I could actually &#34;hear&#34; Boris's voice, and I loved his character. Great story, great writing, and unexpected plot turns. I actually re-read the last 60 pages because she tied up the loose ends beautifully.  So sorry to reach the end!  Highly recommend this novel.
B00DR0PDNE|4|I absolutely love this.  As soon as I got used to it and got a Netflix streaming account, I immediately bought a second Chromecast for our bedroom TV.  In my opinion this sort of thing is the wave of the future.  For $35 and a $9/mo subscription to Netflix, you open up a whole new world of TV watching.  I find now that I end every night watching something streaming on Chromecast.<br /><br />I would easily give this 5 Stars if you could stream local media from your Tablet.  I imagine they'll get there eventually, but for now it seems a bit odd to me.  One of the first things my wife tried to do was play a video of our granddaughter that she had in email.  I had to tell her that didn't work yet.  Not sure whose problem it is, the tablet makers, or Googles, but it really needs to be solved before you can realistically call these things 5 Star.
0670022411|5|This is the kind of witch/vampire story I've been waiting for.  Strong, modern and intelligent, the witch is 50 parts curiosity and 50 parts mystery.  Even she doesn't know what she is capable of doing.  The vampire is mystery, history and reluctant charm, hardly believing his good luck can be permanent.  Will all his love and strength be enough to save his love?  Deborah Harkness delves deep into both their psyches.  There are villains and scary parts, but the worst is wondering if and how the couple will survive with creatures on every side trying to tear them apart.  I am enjoying every page.  This is for the mature reader.
B008GXHOFW|1|i played this game in the xbox 360 and i love but this game for kindle fire version dissapointed me. it doesnt even work. waste of money
B00957T6X6|5|You know nothing Jon Snow...until you read this series. Read it!!!
B009GEEMLY|5|What more could you want, then most of your superheros in one movie.  I mean Iron Man, Capatin American and Thor just to name a few.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who wants to lose themselves in a move that is there to entertain.  Forget your daily grind, gather the family and sit back, relax and enjoy yourselves.  This is one of the few movies that you can watch with your family.
B007IXWL2C|5|You just have to finish the series once you have started and this is a great final book...I really enjoyed the entire series so much I'm thinking of re-reading it.  I might just collect a little more insight now that I know the out come.. great read.  I love it when I enjoy a book so much I hustle through everyday just to find a few minutes here and a few minutes there to read...I had no trouble sitting in Doc offices the entire time I was reading this series.  Love all three books... enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|5|I love that it is challenging without being impossible!
B0011Z3334|5|This album rocks, and rocks hard.  Paramore is my No Doubt replacement (they haven't released a new album in, what -- 7 years now?), and I love them.  Riot! has some amazing songs, especially \\"Fences\\" and \\"Crushcrushcrush.\\"<br /><br />The overall feel for the album is high energy rock, with very few downbeats.  The lead vocalist has an enchanting voice, and she delivers the songs as only a top quality rock singer can.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this album enough!
B00DJFIMW6|5|amazing graphics . really fun . and it is surprisingly not a rip off and i love it there are no pop up,adds its great
B00TEAVEY8|3|It is too easy.  Needs more variety in the scenes.
B007PTJOV0|5|Its a pretty fun game...and its just like Mario :). Nice way to pass the time when you're bored and its free!!!
B007IXWL2C|5|Incredible series cant wait to read this from his point of view.  The teaser they had was just that a teaser
B00KA87GCW|5|Awesome 😂😀🐶
B006MW3V6U|5|For a year I had been hearing from friends about Downton Abbey and didn't have a clue of what they were talking about it until one of them gave me the DVD of the 1st Season.  I was hooked within the first 5 minutes and proceeded to watch an episode every night and immediately ordered Season 2 so I wouldn't miss a night with the Downton Abbey family. Most engaging story, most engaging characters and actors and am counting the days till Season 3 starts.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This is a very good game it's so funny when the animals die I gave 5 stars because you are creative you use your mind and I love games so 5 stars to crossy road
B001A4LYN2|5|Daniel Day Lewis is remarkable, yet again, in the role of Daniel Plainview. The way he can use his voice as a tool to portray a character's essence is spectacular, and he actually makes you garner some sympathy for an otherwise despicable character.  Paul Dano also is an impressive nemesis for Plainview, and this family business story is stirring throughout.
B005LAII44|5|TOTTALLY AWESOME MOVIE LOVED EVERYTHING IT WAS ABOUT
B002436WFI|4|i'm going to presume that you, like myself, are a long-time Discworld reader.  if you're not familiar with the plot of the first two books, or Terry Pratchett's writing, or the themes and characters of Discworld, you should skip this.  although the movie would be a good starting point for anyone unfamiliar with Discworld lore, this review is specifically for veterans of the books, if not the previous adaptations (Wyrd Sisters, Soul Music, Hogfather).    the plot(s) of The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic were carried over mostly intact.  some specific scenes or events are left out or glossed over, but i think it was an acceptable adaptation.    i have no problem with Twoflower being \\"American.\\"  it works, it really does!  i don't remember it saying anywhere that Agateans *look* Asian.  but Twoflower's gormless optimism?  Sean Astin nails it!    i *do* have a problem with Rincewind.  for one, he seems too old; i know that's also a minor complaint, but he didn't look much younger than Cohen.  my bigger gripe is that Rincewind is supposed to be a runner (away), not a eye-roller.  less befuddled muttering, more screaming for help in 87 languages.  too much of his faux-exasperation falls flat    since i mentioned Cohen, i must say they did him justice.  mostly.  i mean, you can *clearly* see his teeth while he's complaining about not having teeth.  but his mannerisms and fight scenes are spot-on!    what else?  oh, the Librarian.  one of everyone's favorite characters, they must have gotten him perfect, right?  nope, it's an unconvincing guy in an ape suite.  i'm presuming they had reasons not to use a *real* orangutan, but the costume simply didn't work, in my eye.  put a man in an ape suit and it still moves like a man, not an ape.  it would have been less unreal (eg, more fantastic) to use a CG orang, or a Henson-esque puppet.    Death seemed better actuated (physically) than in Hogfather, but some of his lines sound more like Marvin from HHGTTG than Death.  for easy example: \\"I WAS AT A PARTY, YOU KNOW\\" sounded more like a complaint than a reproach.  still, \\"I THINK I JUST HAD ANOTHER NEAR-RINCEWIND EXPERIENCE\\" is worth the price of admission  =)    finally, the Luggage.  its movement was perfect!  it trundles around in a bouncy gait, often chasing people around in the background.  i wish its homicidal nature had been more on display, and they never did show its mouth (\\"lots of big square teeth, white as sycamore, and a pulsating tongue, red as mahogany\\") but its \\"expressions\\" and reactions were subtle and brilliant.    all in all, i enjoyed The Colour of Magic more than Hogfather.  i also feel more comfortable recommending it to non-fans as there's less background to know and hidden context to be aware of.    i can't wait for Going Postal, the next adaptation.  oook!
B004DP9QFS|5|Free app of the Day!!!!
B00J8NDGOM|3|i really liked this but hey im colorblind so it wasnt easy but hey I liked it so go for it and try it
B007SGLZP8|5|This is a wonderful read. I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Will most likely read it again because I read it so quickly.
B003LZJI86|5|Great songs, my favorite Bon Jovi album!  The delivery was fast and the CD is in excellent shape.  This is the only CD that has the song \\"Hallelujah\\" on it.  Looked everywhere, should have known Amazon would have it!  Thank you.
0393325172|5|O'Brian's talent ranges over several facets of early eighteenth century society with astonishing competence (e.g. music, social manners, natural philosophy and theology), while reserving a greater part, still, for a natural description of the technicalities of sailing and the Royal Navy.  In this book, and the following books, O'Brian consistently demonstrates his genius for creating diverse, entertaining, believable and natural characters; plots which are plausible in that they are infallibly shaped by the emotions of these characters; and more impressive than all of this put together, perhaps, a style which flows perfectly naturally, without waste, and with no unnecessary economies.
B005K17RU0|5|I have been using this app for a couple of weeks.  It gives weather and forecasts at a glance and is great for getting the weather forecasts when you are traveling.
B0009HLDFU|2|Yes, i am a foo fighters fan, rating \\"nothing left to lose\\" as one of my favourite albums ever, but this album was an amazing flop to my ears, on the heavier CD, there are just no \\"tunes\\", \\"best of you\\" is a poor and formulaic four chord piece of weener rock and the other songs, average in their riffdom and choruses, fail to leave landmarks such as \\"hero\\" \\"learn to fly\\" or \\"everlong\\" did. <br /> <br />things improve with disc 2, some pleasant chords but to be honest when we have amazing stuff like tweaker and bjork these days, these vaguely pretty songs fail to mark aswell <br /> <br />go back to the drawing board foo fighters, fame has gone to your heads, give us another \\"godzilla\\" before you quit mr grohl, go on, please do.
B00820N2JG|2|I would have given it 4 stars had I been able to get stoned before viewing. Since my job doesn't allow that type of recreation, the movie was barely tolerable.
B0000DIXN7|3|Amy Winehouse - Frank (Universal, 2003)<br />I read about Amy on dustygroove.com and I had to check this album out. She doesn't disappoint here. It may take some time to get into her voice, though. She has a Ms. Dynamite/Nelly Furtado thing going on (although I would listen to Furtado over these two artists). Still, help yourself to &quot;Help Yourself&quot; and the funny but true &quot;F*** Me Pumps&quot;, where Amy tells a woman to stop dressing the way she does if she wants some respect in the clubs. Producer Salaam Remi (Nas' God's Son, Fugees' The Score) contributes here as well; in fact, &quot;In My Bed&quot; features the same beat from Nas' &quot;Made You Look&quot;. -EJR
1475143389|5|Of all the Books I've read over the years about weight training and eating, this is by far the easiest to understand! It breaks one what you need to do to bulk, cut, or just maintain a certain weight for everyone from the beginner weightlifter, to the experienced bodybuilder. An overall great book! Feel free to contact Mike as well. I honestly believe that he is really trying to get people in better shape and not just sell books.
B00CPH8FH6|5|Pacino at his best!
B00APJLFEG|3|ehh
B002VPE1WK|4|I purchased this bag recently and even though it looks pretty small, it can accomodate a reasonable amount of stuff apart from my camera, three lenses, a flash, charger and some filters I carry around. I tried hanging my tripod at the side but it kinda tipped over the bag a bit and it looked like it could rip the side seams of the tripod holder so I didn't try it again. So overall it's a good backpack for a camera and some lenses but might not be the best choice to attach a tripod to.
B00005JMAH|4|This was a great movie, based upon the book, it follows the key story line without any added extras that wasnt included within the book. A great purchase for any Harry Potter fan.
0375851569|5|Nice set. Brought me back to my childhood days. I wanted my daughter to have the same books I did.
1885167776|5|I am happy with the purchase, great price for a good quality book :)
B00JGWZV5M|4|The music is cool, the graphics look nice along with nice sound effects and block destruction.  The gameplay is simple you cascade all blocks one of 4 directions those that match at least 3 dissolve under most circumstances.  So far this is the only game on kindle I've spent any real time.playing.
B0029LCJJS|5|Awesome!!!
B008IJTFYW|5|This is my second white noise app to help me sleep.  The first one seems harsh compared to this one.  I like being able to create my own mix and give each individual sound its own level of volume.  Considering purchasing the upgrade.
B00MO420DU|5|I'm a big kid I want to take all of them out of box and play with them I just can't do it knowing I'll be struggling to put them back neatly and I have 10 monster high dolls I'll buy all of them eventually.
B003WE9TU8|5|Awesome concept. Way, way better than (and different from) the movie.<br />The kind of book you wish wouldn't end.<br /><br />An easy and satisfying read.
0345803485|5|Even people that live under rocks have read this book. I am sure that they agree it's one of the most complicated and sweet book they've ever read.
B00PXZT1RA|5|Long game with lots of play.  Maybe a few too many hops but fun.  Good graphics.
B009AP2G26|3|I did not care for the new cast. Trying to hard. I liked they brought back the others. It is just ok.
B00DR0PDNE|5|This product has made our life easier.  there is no need to use hdmi or connect to Xbox to use Netflix.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love to play when I am stressed. It is a great destresser. The higher levels make you think. It keeps my mind sharp.
B00SH04286|5|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was not what I expected but I would watch it several more times.
B00942XS04|5|Great movie!
B00APUYWYA|5|Excellent movie. Love the music
B002GSXKN8|5|My son loves these!
B00HV2KPNW|5|I absolutely LOVE this movie.  It is funny, heartwarming and has some excellent lessons for girls.<br /><br />I love that they finally addressed marrying someone without knowing them.  I love that her &#34;act of true love&#34; involved her sister and not a guy.  I have watched this about 6 times now and I have yet to find anything that I don't love about this movie!
B00I8H7APK|5|I laughed so hard that I couldn't hear what they were saying. It was romantic, funny, sad and happy. A great romance.
B00FAX6XQC|4|The best guns cost you but the game is fun and would be better if all the guns were available for bucks instead of coins.
B000002KNY|5|this album is one of their best works. they are truly the greatest band ever.
B004EBT5CU|4|Good album, as everyone knows by now.  For some reason, I never did get around to buying it, probably because of the constant airplay on the radio and XM.  But, I finally broke down and ordered the CD, which was cheaper than buying the MP3 album, yet included it for free.  Funny, huh?<br />Listened to it completely through 2 times in a traffic jam.  Still like it!
B000OZ0NXA|5|It's been a while, but I got back into reading again and started with Killing Floor! What a great novel! I didn't want to stop reading it even when my eyes were begging for sleep. I made time to pick it back up to continue on his journey. I found myself envisioning it as a movie and was able to see all the action. I was able to follow and sometimes ask why, why, why, but the outcome was always positive. You root for him all the way.<br />Just started &#34;Die Trying&#34; (No.2) and look forward to No.15!!<br />I definitely recommend this book (and author) to all.
B007ZGO7EM|5|Easy and awesome.
B0027MJU00|3|Maybe I'm just getting better at predicting outcomes than is fun for a reader but I really wasn't very impressed with the \\"twists\\" in this one. Read it because I enjoyed Gone Girl and now know I prefer that one better. Not bad for a weekend read.
B00E193TM2|3|About half the tracks are good. the song with the duet with Rob Halford would be much better if it had more than 30 seconds of Halford in it.<br /><br />After a few listens, my favorite track is probably their cover of &#34;Mama Said Knock You Out.&#34;
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This app is amazing! You'll like it if you like Flappy Bird! It's just like Flappy Bird, but not as annoying! :D
B00L9B7IKE|5|It took about mid way for me to really fall into this book.  Excellent character development!!
B0067TQQI8|4|will rate it higher when i have it a little longer, right now to early to tell, seems nice but will wait
B007FG9LIE|5|Probably the best book from Blake. There are so few hints to guess that story takes place in the future. The question is if this is science fiction or a window to our near future.
B0064W65UM|4|Love this one.  Most likely a five star rating with a re-read as the numerous characters were tricky to keep track of and tell apart.  The climax of the story was powerful, will stay with me.  Thank you for sharing your genius Mr. Moore.
B00FKF0F3C|5|At times hard to keep the families lines straight, but checked back on the geneograms which was very helpful.  Ver much enjoyed the development of the characters .  Putting the history into the series made it even more thoughtful.
B0009QTS1M|5|Come for Russell, stay for Oliver. Come for the action, stay for the story. You can watch this movie from any point IN the movie and still get sucked in by the drama, costumes, acting, scenery..........it's all good!
B008PWN0I4|4|It is small, light, and easy to connect. The connection usually works fine, and the transmission is constant and strong, the two-way communication to listen and control the iPod classic is good. The only problem is that occasionally it does not working and stay blocked with the blue light on. The only solution is reset the iPod. I recommended it.
B0007TKNII|5|I loved the movie. Excellant quality and new as stated. Great price!!!  Prompt delivery, no hangups. Easy to order, prompt service. I LIKE AMAZON. They have a great selection to choose from.   I will purchase my next movie this way.  You can't go wrong at AMAZON.   I like opera, so it is kind of a selective movie. But, I truly enjoyed this flick.  I would recommend it to all who like opera or musicals. No swearing or nudity so I think any family members fifteen and older would enjoy it also. It might be a little to spooky for smaller children.
0307454541|3|This first book of the trilogy is rather slow and wanders around with family matters for the most part.  There are some suspenseful chapters.  The real payoff comes with reading the second and third books of the trilogy.  They are much better.
B007FEFLTO|5|What a tour de force! So far, I’ve spent around 2000 pages, and countless hours inside the world that Ken Follett has created for his Century Trilogy. I’ve just finished Winter of the World – book two of the Century Trilogy, and all I can say is wow!<br />Continuing on from where book one left us, Winter of the World explores the lives of our favourite characters, as well as their offspring. Just like in book one, we are treated to a snapshot of these characters daily interactions against some of the major occurrences of the 20th century. As we know, Follett is an expert at covering huge events, with a huge amount characters, in a way that doesn’t leave the reader confused or exasperated. Setting his story mainly within WWII, and masterfully managing to show all the different perspectives that helped to shape this period, Follett allows us to see life – both from the view of everyday citizens and government officials – unfold, and indeed the consequences that occur from the smallest action, to the biggest action.<br />I’m not going to lie to you: When reading a book of this magnitude, page length and content matter included, it can sometimes be a bit overwhelming. You get so invested in Follett’s world, that you begin to forget your own world, and then when you get sucked back into reality, it can be hard to get back into the alternate reality. I had to take a break for a week or two, but after that, I got straight back into it and thoroughly enjoyed myself.<br />Sequels are usually nowhere near as good as their predecessor; however, in this case, I actually enjoyed it slightly more. I think it was more to do with the time period rather than the actual writing or story, so do not let that put you off starting this trilogy. All in all, this is another 5 star result from Follett, and I cannot wait to get stuck into the final book!
B00005O3VC|5|its gotta be the weirdest and funniest movie of all time.  Its complete lunacy.  I've seen it so many times i could resite the script in this review.But i wont.

B000YIGNKE|1|This adaptation of Jane Austen's brilliant story is laughably bad. The acting is quite the worst I've seen in a very long time--I'm not entirely sure what Amanda Hale was attempting in her portrayal of Mary Musgrove, but the character ended up coming across as very weird and possibly demented. Sally Hawkins was perhaps more attractive than Amanda Root's Anne Elliot, but seemed to think gasping and a perpetually slack mouth constitutes a good performance.<br /><br />Rupert Penry-Jones gave me a glimmer of hope in his performance, but any acting skill he possesses was forced into the background by a truly terrible script. If the writer and director actually read Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion\\" (of which I am not convinced), I'm quite curious why they felt the events of the story needed to be cut up and rearranged.<br /><br />The conversation Anne has with Harville in the book, regarding the constancy of women, instead takes place between Anne and Benwick, outside Wentworth's hearing--which is rather extraordinary, since Wentworth's overhearing of that conversation is what prompts his declaration of love. It is all finished off by a very unladylike and period-inappropriate sprint through Bath (complete with enough shaky cam to suit any extreme sports filmmaker), and one of the worst on-screen kisses I have ever seen.<br /><br />I can't think of a single redeeming thing to say about this film, and forcing myself to finish it was nothing short of torture.
B00884GR0W|5|this game is like minecraft but 1000 times better the creatures are so awesome like the dragon and there is a lot of weapons at your disbolsle
B0033H7VI6|5|If your into the outdoors like I am and enjoy collecting decent quality knives that will really take a beating if your forced into a difficult situation, buy one of these. Their inexpensive & made from 1095 high carbon steel just like a Kabar, but they are twice as thick & you could easily use one of these knives to chop down a tree if you had to ( no kidding ). They're a lil bit on the heavy side, but you need tools like this to survive when you don't have much else to depend on except your survival skills and the items that your carrying with you.
B00HZ4ASEC|5|Funny, heartwarming,  should of had one more actor in my opinion, Dustin Hoffman as well...hey and why not add Merely Streep!!
B004SBQAN8|5|It is really nice when I and my wife and teenager can all go see a movie and all enjoy the heck out of it. This was an excellent movie well worth seeing. I hope they make a sequel. Good family fun.

B00KTDD69A|5|Makes my time go by fast! 🐁
B0041KKYEM|5|I watched this film at a theater near me on early march when was available in my town, after the academy awards and was a shock! Actually this is a great film, some kinda mental but with the thriller at the core with some traces of good old horror flicks. I remember the comments on amazon abut this one when I didn't see it, one was remarkable talking about an Argento style rip-off. Anyway, here is what you got: a sneak peek into the ballet (I'm a totally ignorant about it) world with the just portion of sensuality and sexual intensity with both feeling repression and untamed rage in a black atmosphere of human emotions and mental affections. Great film for troubled mother-daughter relationships...and Natalie Portman,  & Mila Kunis are/look so gorgeous, and a very decadent Wynona Ryder and Vincent Cassel as usual, totally amazing performance of the whole cast and the music is simple sublime. I'm going now through the extras that are a deep view on the film-making, not to forget the pretty double ballerina of Miss Portman. Now I understand why Degas loved so much the ballerinas!
B004SKQAJI|5|The 'Lord of the Dance' returns and Michael Flatley and his spectacular dance troupe, with him. In this sold out performance of his 2011 European Tour, filmed LIVE in Dublin, Ireland and in London, England, Flatley and company, do not disappoint. In fact, his performance is superb and what's not to like, is more like it?! It captivates audiences worldwide with breathtaking dances that will astound and amaze you. And, as if this phenomenal dance production wasn't enough, included on this DVD disc, comes the bonus features of a 'behind the scenes' look, along with deleted scenes. Plus, the feature and extra subtitles are in no less than 10 languages, besides English. And the sound? How about 5.1 Dolby Digital/2.0 LPCM?! And if you're not a dancer before watching this dancing extravaganza, you will want to at least get out and onto the dance floor, after viewing this. So, have fun and enjoy and save a dance, for me! Nina Kish
B006ID6NDQ|5|Very well written and thought provoking.<br />It certainly gave me more knowledge on WW2
B00E9ZATTY|4|Overall it's a beautiful,colorful film to look at..Not quite as brilliant as the first one but still a enjoyable flick..
B00006AW63|5|I watched it as a kid and loved it, she loves it now.  Cute movie!  Can't go wrong with Disney!
B00KGL7Y6Q|5|Excellent!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5|I loved the writing and the story. Everyone loves a love story and everyone can relate to someone close having an illness.<br /><br />The book captured my attention from page 1 and I loved every single character.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone
B0054JZC6E|4|lots of games to be able to okay for free. the amount of points for each game is a little high.
B001I9YOHW|5|A classic!  A great movie to watch on Halloween night!  It has that small town setting, mixed with the 80s wonderfulness... it's fantastic!
B00633W614|5|Mr Archer is a great writer.  He leaves you at the end of each chapter want more information.  Great story teller.  After reading Sins of the Father I went back and read his earlier book and enjoyed each as well.
0811875040|3|Update #3 on 10/20/2011:  Following is a copy of an e-mail response that I received from Miette's Publicist earlier this afternoon...............  It seems to conflict with Cindy's post (see 1 star reviews) where she spoke with someone from Chronicle Publishing.  I do feel for the author as well.  Miette would be a wonderful cookbook to own; but who wants to have to refer back and forth to a card for recipe corrections.  Years from now one of us that bought this book will pick it up to use and the errata card will have been misplaced and the corrections lost forever..........  1.  Copies of the revised version are NOT in stock anywhere. They will be in stock on Amazon and the Chronicle Books website in a few days.  [.....right now ...they don't exist in the world as of yet.]  2.  Amazon WILL be sending revised copies when they come in if you have reached out to them.  3.  The kindle version is the only version currently on Amazon only because they are out of stock of Miette (the book with errors) because everyone is buying it.  Update:    As of today, 10/20/2011, it appears that Amazon is only selling the electronic version of this cookbook.  The hardcopy is no longer available to order directly from Amazon, only it's resellers.  Since I like to physically hold my books, I will not be purchasing the \\"Kindle\\" copy.  I'm so very disappointed :-(  Original review:  I pre-purchased the original Miette book back in June, 2011.  In July 2011, Amazon notified me that there were errors in the recipes and that a revised edition would be released in October 2011.  Amazon also indicated that they would send me the revised edition at no charge.    Well, trying to get the revised edition has proved to be a nightmare of e-mail and telephone communications with customer service.  Ultimately, they refunded me the original purchase price of the book and I'm now left to reorder the book on my own.  I contacted the publisher who confirmed that Amazon should have the revised editionavailable to ship replacements to its original customers the week beginning October 16, 2011.  Any shipments to customers ordering the book after this date from Amazon should also receive the revised edition.  With this information, I will order this book again.  I'll provide an update to this review as to which version of the book I receive.  Hopefully, it will be the corrected version.  I read the original cookbook and loved its simplistic and tasty sounding recipes and decorated cakes.  They seem the perfect dessert for serving at the end of a dinner party or even if you just want to have friends over for dessert and coffee.  I hadn't tried any of the recipes because shortly after receiving the book I was informed of the errors.  In the interim, however, I purchased various sizes of smaller cake pans in order to make some of the wonderful cakes.  I love this book based on what I've seen and read.  So now, I'm very anxious just to get baking!!
B006ATJXQW|4|I expected a little more but overall it's a good book. The triology needs to be read first for this book to truly make sense.
B000083E79|4|Had songs that I was unfamiliar with and i had hoped it would have had more of her older hits
1588167461|5|Very intricate book for those that do not understand business class style. I only began to wear suits and classier clothes. This book will give the reader an in depth education on how to dress to impress. The intricate detail of what colors go with what designs, watches, and cuff links give an uneducated reader the knowledge they need to dress well and look sharp. Very impressed.
B000002MZ9|5|What a great album this is. Give Neil Young credit; he will play with anyone and play many styles of music and he almost always pulls it off. He challenges himself here once again by playing with Pearl Jam and it is one of the best pure rock and roll albums I have ever heard. Neil and Pearl Jam sound as if they are having one hell of a good time doing this and we as listeners are the ones that benefit. This sucker really rocks and is similiar to Ragged Glory. This marriage of ideas does take on its' own style though. The sound is muddy but it appears to have been done that way on purpose and here it works well. It has a great garage band feel to it. There is not a bad cut on this thing. Neil just simply continues to amaze me. He is constantly turning out great stuff no matter how old he gets. How many artists can make that claim?
B005CRQ2DK|4|This book was awsome. It was totally worth eight or nine dollars. You should definitely tri it man. Increadibly awsome man.
B000E0OBK6|1|Unfortunately I was dissapointed by Jarhead.  This is mainly due to the action packed previews I saw and loved so much.  As far as I can tell the previews contined almost every second in the film that contained a gun being fired or an explosion.  This lead me to believe there would be a lot of action in the movie.<br /><br />I was also dissapointed by the fact that the scenes in boot camp were plucked straight from Full Metal Jacket.  The dialogue, althought true to life, was unoriginal.<br /><br />I love movies about the first gulf war, of which there are few (Courage under fire, Three Kings, Bravo Two Zero) so I could not wait to see Jarhead. Ultimately my excitement about it probably led to me disliking it more as a result.  However, it was ultimately the previews that portrayed the movie as action packed that proved to be the biggest let down.
B00B4BJY7E|5|Nice snappy processor plus built in graphics were a plus. Use this to play Smite and MC.
B00JL6L4UY|5|I like it very much
B005K0HDGE|5|One of the best books I've ever read. Very memorable characters and just an awesome all around story. I didn't want the book to end.
B00HHE9H24|3|this book was fine but like all sort stories it leaves you wondering. too many unfinished thoughts and unanswered questions.

B005D51II0|5|In the late 1950's, at the dawn of stereophonic recording, several classical record labels embraced the new technology wholeheartedly. At the top of the pack were Decca, Mercury Living Presence, and RCA Living Stereo. Each label had a crew of recording engineers dedicated to using the new stereo recording capability to create state of the art recordings, in anticipation of the forthcoming standardization of stereo LPs for the consumer market, which happened in 1958.<br /><br />This collection spans many years of Decca recordings, from the late 1950's out through the late 2000's, including the transition from analog tape recording to digital. How do the older analog recordings compare to more modern digital recordings? The original performance was captured first on magnetic recording tape, and then transferred to the LP master. Magnetic tape recording has several limitations, compared with today's digital recording. The most important limitations are tape hiss, limited dynamic range, and bad distortion (overmodulation resulting in clipping) that occurs if the incoming audio level is higher than the tape can accommodate. The Decca engineers worked carefully to avoid overmodulation distortion, so the worst you'll hear on these CDs is some residual tape hiss. It's subtle, and doesn't really detract from the overall enjoyment of the sound. In short, even these earlier recordings sound splendid.<br /><br />The diversity of music presented in this collection is impressive. We have early music from 1551, modern composers like Walton, Bartok, and Britten, and everything in between. There's orchestral music, opera, solo piano, and even cabaret songs. Most of the albums are on the Decca label, but Decca's associated labels L'Oiseau Lyre and Argo are also represented.<br /><br />Of course, even with 50 CDs, this collection doesn't come close to covering the entire Decca catalog. But what's here is wonderful, both for Decca fans and also for anyone new to classical music. At roughly $2 per CD, it's a great way to quickly assemble a diverse classical music library. Also check out the equally impressive and bargain priced box sets from [[ASIN:B005XBA9Y8 Mercury Living Presence Boxed Set]] and [[ASIN:B003UCPEJ2 Living Stereo 60 CD Collection Box]].
B007RI56NY|5|Train hit California 37 out of the park! I can't get enough of it. I love listening and tapping my toes right along. This goes right up there with their previous albums that I can listen to over and over again. Love how the words are really true to the Train from the heart songwriting.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Graphics are great on my kindle fire hd. Downloaded the game for my little sister and I ended up playing. I'm 25... enough said.
B000SJJCX4|1|What a nightmare.<br />I had just re-strung two guitars the day of my first gig with a new group I joined.  Right after putting the strings on, I did a quick guitar tune using the tuner in garageband, just because I happened to be sitting at my computer when I was putting the strings on, otherwise I may have used this pedal tuner and realized it was not working.<br /><br />By the time I took the stage that night, the strings had obviously loosened up quite a bit, so I plugged this pedal tuner in and - nothing.  No lights, nothing. There I am looking like a goof with my out of tune guitar at my first gig with this group.  Let me tell you, it did not make me look very professional, which is exactly how I wanted to appear that night.  I mean, I bought new strings for both guitars, bought a brand new stage pedal tuner, bought all new cables, all because I wanted to impress these guys and not have any amateurish technical difficulties.  These guys delivered too!  They packed in about 300 people into a tiny night club, and there I am standing in the lights trying to tune by ear…  Total Nightmare!<br /><br />If you play stages, stay away from this tuner!  It may be fine for it to break on you if you aren't under pressure to perform, but if you are going to play in public in front of people, do not trust it!<br /><br />I thought I was being so smart by saving myself money and buying this cheapy instead of the real deal, but I guess I'm just gonna have to cough up the extra money and buy a PRO tuner.<br /><br />I had this thing for less than 3 weeks.  I had read some other reviews before I bought it that said that as long as you don't jump on it, it works great.  I was NOT jumping on it, as a matter of fact I WAS VERY GENTLE WITH IT because I had read those reviews before I decided to buy it.<br /><br />Amazon's return policy offers to replace defective items with the exact same model - no thanks.  Not gonna fool me twice.
B0013ND36G|1|i got the package but my uncle already bought me this, when returning it i have never got my refund, nor i got a message. plus there was no way to contact them. do not buy it at all nor waste your time looking at it. thank god i have money still but never will buy it no more unless i get my refund to erase all this and start some thing new.
B003UXRZIY|5|I read the books years ago and did not even know this series was out, which I feel is one of the reasons this show only had 2 seasons.  I believe with the proper marketing, this show would have finished the saga of the Sword of Truth. Yes, die-hard book fans might turn their noses up at it.  I was one of them but this show is sheer and pure brillance.  I am so sorry that I missed it when it was on.  With all the horrible shows on TV that seem to stay on forever, this one got 2 seasons.  The actors, though almost all were unknown to me, were perfect for the parts, and I honestly never saw so many beautiful women in one cast on ANY show.  Also, Craig Parker, who plays Darken Rahl, is the epitome of what ever villan should ever hope to be.  He is deliciosly evil.  Just action-packed, sprinkled with humor, longing, magic, and good versus evil. This show deserves to still be on the air.  It's a darn crying shame it isn't.
B000GTJT0W|5|WOW! is how I want to start this review. This is an EXCELLENT HD-DVD. This is what HD is all about. The picture quality is superb and the sound is awesome. I own the standard version as well and now that I have the HD version....I have given the standard version away. Yes, it's that good! For those of you who have a HD player already get this movie and you will see what I'm talking about. Yes, the movie is great as well. It has lots of action and it's funny! For those of you who are on the \\"fence\\" about Blu-Ray and HD.....there is no doubt in my mind that HD will win this war. I have about 10 HD movies and they are all EXCELLENT! From what I have read the Blu-Ray movies are not nearly as good as HD. At this time HD is so far ahead that Blu-Ray will not catch up. Plus the titles on Blu-Ray SUCK! I cannot not imagine that Blu-Ray will look any better than HD. Also keep in mind that the only Blu-Ray player on the market is the one by Samsung(which from the reviews suck) Sony still has not launched it's player. Toshiba is now about to release it's second generation player in Dec-06.
B009HUB40Y|4|This game is similar to Bejeweled and other clones.  It is a match three or more jewels and you compete for the highest score.  It is a great game to play if you are stuck somewhere with time on your hands.  I'm enjoying this game.
054531058X|1|I honestly can't see the why anyone would give this book a good review.  The book is about 320 pages long.  The first 150 pages were used to develop the main character who seemed even more unfamiliar as the story rolled along.  The author claims to have gotten her idea for the book from contemporary research.  This is a lie, whether she or her publisher admits it or not.  The book too closely resembles the premise of Battle Royale.    Actually, towards the end of Hunger Games I started wondering, why was the author including a love story plot to the book that, up to that point, was devoid of such an idea.    After reading Battle Royale, I saw why.  However, Collins was extremely less successful in developing her characters (which were a handful) then the Japanese author (which were many).    I know there are alot of Collin's fans that would like to hunt me down after this review but I have to be honest.  Her idea was stolen and if you don't believe me, read Battle Royale.  I guarantee you will come to the same conclusion.
B001C4AFP8|5|Films involving 'current events'--particularly those relating to anything happening in the Middle East and Terrorism--tend to be soaked in the writers', producers' and director's politics, which usually end up very much in-your-face and spoil the film, because you suddenly lose the story and drown in the preaching and proselytizing.<br /><br />Ridley Scott, who has already addressed the West-East/Christianity-Islam issue in a previous film, 'Kingdom of Heaven', this time bit the bullet (instead of the sword) and continued KoH's story about 1000 years later. 'Body of Lies' is very much a Ridley Scott movie and this translates into the film's politics as well. Thing is, you can't leave politics out of a political movie; and so what do you do?<br /><br />Well, here's a newsflash for the poli-preachers on all sides: it's possible to have it all, and just watch Ridley Scott do it. Just like KoH, it's all about even-handedness and realizing that (1) every side in a conflict has a point of view, which, to itself, is perfectly valid; and (2) every side has people you'd probably like and some you really wouldn't, (3) the way to peace lies with understanding (1) and (2); and not with having just one point of view, no matter how righteous it may appear. Both, Islamophobes and Islamophiles--or those on the extremes of any aspect of the political spectrum--will probably find ample elements to dislike about this film. Others of a more moderate and even-handed disposition will find much to like and appreciate.<br /><br />All of this, rather profound, stuff is wrapped up in a gritty Ridley Scott production and direction, that keeps your full attention for its full 2+ hours. Leonardo DiCaprio has really grown up and cast off his annoying persona, which was so prominent in just about all his movies; until 'Blood Diamond' came along. Russell Crowe is basically a secondary character, eclipsed almost completely by DiCaprio and Mark Strong. The latter has come a long way since I first saw him in the BBC production of Jane Austen's 'Emma'. The gentle and understated romance element provided by Golshifteh Farahani as 'Aisha' provided a nice contrast to the testosterone-soaked male world in which this drama plays out.<br /><br />The movie confirms what I've known for a long time: Ridley Scott apparently can do no wrong.ion of Jane Austen's 'Emma'.

B000VS6R26|5|Director Cameron paid amazing attention to detail, recreating every set to look exactly like photos of the real ship. The engine room is a masterpiece. Filmed on a living, restored Liberty Ship (whose powerplant is a fraction of the size of Titanic's), CGI was employed to create miniature catwalks and tiny blackgang crew, and the impression of coal-stoked operation. Costumes and accessories, even the meals served, were faithfully replicated. Actors were chosen who actually resemble the historical figures in the supporting cast. The special effects involved in the sinking, utilizing a full scale model, are spectacular. Likewise the remarkable authentic footage taken from the real Russian research ship and minisubs. By brilliantly framing the past story in the present, Cameron shares with his audience his own wondrous experience of visiting the Titanic in her North Atlantic grave. A marvelous film!!
B006IYG5HE|5|Very interesting plot. A 'must-read' book indeed!
B00GP1ANXC|1|It shows you categories and then just takes you to youtube where the videos don't even work!! Not a good app... I recommend not getting it...
B001KVZ6FW|5|Got for our grandson and he loves it. He is always imitating the whole movie and almost knows it by heart.  He has part of a toy that is his house and we got a balloon for him to tie to it and he has some little people that he uses.  It is really cute to watch him play.
B002VISNAS|5|For a few weeks after I read this book I started many conversations with &#34;in this book Blink that I just read, it said ... &#34; to elicit groans from my husband.<br />Great read, insightful, well written and thoroughly added value to my life.
B00JJH3FDE|2|For a low)er) budget sci-fi movie it wasn't half bad. Although the plot could have been better and it fell short a couple of times. The special effects were pretty good. Not bad for a first time director
B00KFUU6H2|4|Thoroughly enjoyed the thought provoking life of a principaled man of that time period.
B008JEJOAG|5|Duel Sport have deeper lugs than conventional Crocs, better for loose surfaces. Fit is identical to the originals.<br /><br />Very pleased.
0767827902|5|An American masterpiece of the first order.  Peter Bogdanovich suffered the Orson Welles syndrome - making his masterpiece first and then falling slowly down the Hollywood ladder to his current oblivion without achieving Welle's stature as 'autuer' and seemingly has a sub conscience awareness of the fact since he wrote one of the definitive biographies of Welles himself (In all fairness - I'm sure he'd disagree with me).  The Last Picture Show is a magnificent piece of American story telling and has to be seen to be explained or understood.  This version brings a genius vision into sharper focus. So with no further ado I urge you to buy it and watch it.
0810993139|4|For older kids for sure.  My 6 yr old asked for this, but I'm putting it away till he is maybe 7 or 8.
0783225970|5|I was first taken to see this film when i was 16 (by my mum,bless her)and i can say i was hooked on al pacino for life , this is the movie that set a new standard in gangster drug movies.10 out of 10
B00R3DODWI|5|Fabulous movie, great characters, fantastic special effects, wonderful plot conclusion.  It made me want to go back and watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy as that I could relive the end of the storyline.
0375869026|5|My grandson said the whole class had to read this book and it was wonderful.<br />i would recondmend this book for all schools to read.
0634022296|4|Great book and easy to read.  It is a Christmas gift he loves the Beatles and I am sure he will like it.
B00BD6EJRK|4|Good app for amateur photo editing
B009UNGYHG|5|Works like I expected it to work
B005HEVBGG|5|Love the series.  So happy to see it is on here.  Will be here awhile and watch all the series
B00LXLM05I|5|This is a really well made game. It has a lot in it, and is very developed.
B000OV170W|5|i loved the book, I even cried at the end, even though I thought it was far too strongly forshadowed. I have an objection to the claim that it addressed the issue but failed to resolve it: I don't think that was the intent. I found the book gripping and realistic.
B00HDMMISA|4|but darn good. This book is really about spousal abuse/domestic violence. The school politics go on and on, but I loved subtle humor. A good read, entertaining read and MUMS with kids may like it even more.
B00LNTKDYA|5|I purchased this case half year ago already. It still looks new, it´s easy to clean, nicely covers my Kindle. The only drawback is that when I put it standing on a smooth surface it sometimes collapses, but it´s not a huge problem, just need to put a blockage behind or choose the surface better. :)
B000Q6ZG5M|5|it is exactly what was described would gladly buy it again if I needed it, am very happy with it
B007TBZ63Y|5|this book is a well rounded ......... it has a good story line with a ending that was buried behind. I find that this is the best story out of the series so far. In other word  this book is imply flawless
B00JOT3HQ2|4|this game is really fun i love all of the levels but i dont like that you have to pay for the rest of the game
0375826726|4|I enjoyed the first two books of this series, and was eager to read the third. I won't outline the plot, because you can find that elsewhere. I will just tell you what I think about this book.<br /><br />It is an enjoyable read, and a worthy third installment to the series. I thought that Eragon was a very good story, and Eldest not quite as good, although Paolini's writing had improved. Brisingr is the best of the three. I fell back into the story right away, and I found myself caring about the characters, even worrying about their safety. This is what I look for in fiction: it made me want to pick up the book every chance I got. If it interferes with the rest of my life, it is a very good book. Brisingr is one of those books. I am thankful to my son that he recommended this series to me.<br /><br />Some reviewers of Eldest were very critical of the fact that the plot is derivative of other epics, like The Lord Of The Rings or Star Wars. I didn't mind this in the least. It is the tale of a hero's journey, complete with absence, devestation and return. It is one of the oldest tales in storytelling. We already know the story, but it is the storytelling that makes it good or bad. Paolini is a good writer. Not as great as Tolkein or LeGuin, but good nevertheless. I was able to suspend my inner critic, and enjoy the read. I recommend that you do the same.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good game. Gets progressively harder as you replay each scene as well as changing the seeking styles. Plus the addition of other type puzzles elevates this game to more than just a hidden object game.
B001NLKXK2|5|Beautifully portrayed a serious illness with love and support from family. Julianne Moore Oscar worthy!
B00637UISI|4|This is my favorite soundtrack so far. The early ones had some good songs and introduced me to some bands I was unfamiliar with, but many of those songs had originally been written outside of the Twilight universe.  Now that the franchise is so huge, you can tell that artists are writing songs specifically about these stories. Many of the songs on this soundtrack fit so perfectly and have become fast favorites: Turning Page, A Thousand Years, and Eclipse (All Yours)  If you've seen the movie or read the books, I think you will really appreciate this soundtrack lyrically as well as musically.
B00DR0PDNE|5|This is the best streaming product for YouTube and Netflix. Only its missing Amazon Prime and On Demand streaming... come on Amazon make an app for this...you've sold way over a hundred thousand units. Wouldn't you want to sell to those people? I know I would buy more movies and series from Amazon if they had an app for Chromecast.<br /><br />Definitely easier to use than GoogleTv. And using your Android  phone or Chrome browser on a laptop to control it makes it so easy to use.<br /><br />Seriously,  Amazon get to work:)
B0089LOG02|5|Loved it, this novel is based on fact, I  once saw a documentary about<br />these orphans, it was a real page turner.
B00571F26Y|4|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend who listened to me lament on my issues with eating bread. Makes sense. The author did a great deal of research, I am now eating far less wheat products. I didn't get this book for losing weight, but weight loss is easy when you eliminate all wheat products.
B00C8S9W0G|5|The best book I have read ok n a long time.  Could not put it down.  Held my attention to the very end and left me sorry that the next book is 3Yeats down the road.  Loved the book.
B00000JCB2|5|this cd is pretty good put together if you like hard-core metal,rap with a little bit of humer than you should definetly buy this cd and you will be surprised
B000003BEM|5|This is classic rock, sure, but that don't mean its good.  There's good classic rock, like Barry Manilow, Air Supply, The Carpenters and Herman's Hermits.  Buy those bands if you want good classik rock!!  Also, support The Bengals, there the best football team ever.  Go bengals, who-dey!!!
B008PZZYB2|3|Mediocre at best.  I always root for Ben Stiller but he rarely delivers.  I will keep hoping for a good movie with Ben acting in it.
B0017U7PT6|5|I saw this film in theaters on the opening day. It was amazing: the special effects were great and the storyline was coool! There were some immitations in the movie with the contrast of 300, which made me mad! Rolland Emmerich is one of the best directors!! \\"Pure and Exciting!\\"
B00HEQOAQ8|5|Going into this movie, I was concerned that I would be lost, since I'd only seen a few random episodes of the TV series.  I was pleasantly surprised however that I was able to follow along and enjoy the ride with almost no issue.  I was told that there were plenty of great references to the TV show, but even without those I was able to enjoy the movie and follow the intriguing story.
B003JTHXOK|5|Beautiful and touching. It brought me to tears.This is something I will definitely re-read. The only thing I have left to say is wow
B00GTCECVG|5|This game is a lot like clash of clans but better if you like games like coc you will love this game too there are different heroes wich look awesome one of the best is the vlad Dracula I wish I had him.
B00012QM8G|5|I am interested in history. I didn't care much for it when I was in school. I really didn't learn much. But now in my late 20's and I enjoy watching movies like Schindler's List.
B00MIA0L9U|5|BEAUTIFUL
B003XF1XOQ|5|I really enjoyed reading the Hunger Game series of books.  Not often can you find a good intriguing storyline that isn't filled with crime, sex, and vulgarity.  The Series kept me interested with drama and a slight tale of romance.  Highly recommended for all ages.
B003YFIUW8|4|Room is an extraordinary novel that is told entirely through the eyes of a five-year-old child. It will stay with you and give you a new perspective on the world around you. Jack has spent his first five years confined to one room with his mother. She has protected him, nurtured him and taught him about life, while planning an escape. The aftermath is as fascinating and moving as the story of the confinement.
B00IDI7WP2|5|great
B00BD99JMW|5|Wonderful series.  I hated that she died.  I wish there could have been a better ending.  but all and all these books are worth reading.

B00005JN0T|4|I, ROBOT is based upon ideas created by Isaac Asimov, the beloved and prolific writer who invented many of the \\"rules\\" for writing modern science-fiction. Asimov's book I, ROBOT is the novel that cemented the three laws of robotics: 1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; 3. A robot must protect its own existence, except where such protection would conflict with the First or Second Law. The movie takes those concepts and one of the main character's from Asimov's novel (Susan Calvin, played by Bridget Moynahan) and introduces a story that feels like one of the short stories included in Asimov's I, ROBOT.<br /><br />In the movie, Will Smith plays Chicago detective Del Spooner. Ever since a freak accident, that the audience is briefly given glimpses of in the opening of the movie, Spooner has had strong misgivings about robots. Even though they are supposed to be incapable of hurting a human, Spooner is convinced that robots are up to no good and he doesn't trust them. His feelings towards the machines are beginning to affect his career. Then, Dr. Lanning, one of the executives of US Robots and a friend of Spooner, is found dead at US Robots headquarters apparently because of a suicide. Spooner doesn't believe that and is convinced it's murder. He begins an investigation which leads to the arrest of a robot for murder. But can a robot kill or is Dr. Lanning's death just a small part of a much more sinister plan?<br /><br />I, ROBOT is an entertaining film. It's fairly well written and contains some great acting which is augmented by the movie's special effects. Also, watch out for a small role by Shia LaBeouf as Farber, a street smart kid that looks up to Spooner. The film doesn't raise as many questions as the novel it is very loosely based upon. However, the movie still raises a few questions about the nature of humanity and the mechanized society in which we are increasingly becoming consumed. Overall, I, ROBOT is a surprisingly good movie.about the nature of humanity and the mechanized society in which we are increasingly becoming consumed. Overall, I, ROBOT is a surprisingly good movie.

B003DZX3SA|1|I ended up trying two different [[ASIN:B003DZX3SA Beauty and the Beast]] discs (purchased directly through Amazon, and definitely the real Disney article) and found a serious play flaw in the same spot in each. Each disc cut off the end of the same scene when watched in \\"original theatrical release\\" mode. When we tried \\"extended release\\" mode, they finished the scene, but then jumped back to the beginning of the movie! Amazon was great to deal with re: replacement/returns, but when I asked about maybe trying a different lot, Amazon's answer was that only option open to me was to try purchasing through someone else. Buyer beware! There are a bunch of other versions available, so don't bother with this one.
B008Y79HE6|2|Worst adaptation ever
B00LFF3MKO|1|This movie has one of the dumbest plots of any movie I have ever seen.  Nothing about this movie was enjoyable.  The acting was terrible, the story line atrocious, it was far to gruesome, and it felt like the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; on crack. Watching this movie is a terrible decision.
B00992CF6W|5|OH MY GOD mindcraft is awesome you can make almost ANYTHING it is my most favorite game on my kindle fire whoever sees this should totally get it. IT IS AWESOME if you cant offord minecraft for xbox or pc then get it in the appstore
B008LZHA3G|4|I realize that a lot of people prefer to \\"wait for the covers,\\" that is, they just can't get past Bob's non-pop-oriented vocals. I can understand that, but I would urge the more open-minded folks to give this CD a few hearings. It tends to grow on you. Track-by-track (your results may vary): 1) Duquesne Whistle -- harmless, jaunty opener; 2) Soon After Midnight -- solid Dylan song; 3) Narrow Way -- above-average Dylan song, therefore, WAY above-average by common standards; 4) Long and Wasted Years -- superb Dylan song, reminiscent of \\"Brownsville Girl\\", but a lot shorter; this is a heart-breaker. with a heartbreaking final couplet: \\"So much for tears/So much for these long and wasted years.\\" 5) Pay in Blood -- dark, but with a sly tag-line: \\"I pay in blood/But not my own.\\" 6) Scarlet Town -- OK, but not one I would listen to again and again. 7) Early Roman Kings -- a classic Dylan song, probably the signature song of this CD, though not the title song. 8) Tin Angel -- OK, but kind of a space-filler; I'm not into the pseudo 17th-century ballad style. 9) Tempest -- not quite what was intended, I think; ponderous and kind of a one-idea, predictable song; unfortunately in 3/4 time, which makes it more ponderous. 10) Roll on, John -- It's really, really hard to do a good tribute song, and many tributes are painfully cheesy. This tribute, to John Lennon, is exceptional. It combines intense specificity to John Lennon's life and expansive generality to anyone who's ever lost a close friend or an admired hero. Oddly, it reminds me of \\"I and I\\" in the way it combines concrete details with almost philosophical or religious abstraction. It is a tribute both to Lennon and to Dylan's artistry.
B004XUMMFE|5|One of the best TV Science fiction series ever!  I would like to know who the idiot was that cancelled the series in mid season.  If that person still has a job in the entertainment business, lets hope it's as an usher in movie theater.
B0015AARJI|4|Wasn't exactly the shiny color that my other remote has but otherwise, works perfectly well and it feel comfortable with it.😄
B00005JKLZ|3|I saw this movie first at the Theaters! I have to say that I liked it, actually I loved it... A half year later it came out on DVD; I bought it the second it came out. I was so excited to see it again... I didn't liked it as much as the first time. It wasn't the same! I knew what would come; after that I watched it again, but my conclusion didn't change... I don't have that with other movies like 'the Omen', I watched that movie almost 6 times, I still love it. So don't buy this DVD, go rent it and never see it again, you'll love it the first time!!
0061906220|5|I teach 2 year olds and they LOVE this book.  I got it from the library on a whim back in March ago and they could still recited it from memory a month ago.  I got it from the library again and they were ecstatic to see Pete again.  I even had one of my girls reading a different book and telling herself the story of Pete.  Wonderful, amazing book.  Kudos to the author!
B00846REIS|5|If you loved 50 shades you will love this. These two charictrts are in a slightly similar situation and have a heated affair.  But I love how they interact with each other. Just when you think things are great someone screws it up.
B00005N9CV|5|Great quiet back ground music  or something to listen to on a romantic evening. Came in great shape and can not beat the cost.
158234082X|4|Although not a universally likeable book by any estimation, Bourdain's narrative voice, as crass and straightforward as one would believe the man himself to be, is definitely endearing.  He makes few attempts to describe  for the lay person the many digestibles he hints at in the book, relying on  the wit and sheer perusability of the rest of his work to grasp the reader.    And it does, for over 300 pages.  Kitchen Confidential is a must read for  anyone remotely affiliated with the hospitality industry and well worth  reading for those with at least a passing interest in the inner-workings of  the kitchen from hiring to the way to make one's purveyors arrive on time.   A person with generally no knowledge of fine cuisine will find the first  half of the book fine, but the second half less friendly as it delves into  the more specific nuts and bolts of the restaurant business.  The book is  really part culinary textbook, part biography, with a few eye-catching  treks into hedonism.  It's uneven in parts, but this is altogether in  keeping with the life of Bourdain, as the reader will come to find.
B00005JKES|2|I could'nt wait to get this beautiful DVD, as I'm a big Twin Peaks fan, but I've been really disapointed to realize that no subtitles at all were on this issue. Not even in english for people who does'nt ear well. No spanish, nor french (some people in Canada speak french you know ?)<BR>I tryed to get in touch with the company, but they ignored me, as arogant as possible.
B00BUCW54Q|2|This movie is 2 hours and 11 min of pure boring! I watched it because I did wan't to know how it ended... But it wasn't worth the time. I'm just glad this was free, if I had actually paid for it, I would have been very mad.<br /><br />I have never read any of the Jack Reacher stuff, so I do not know if it was true to the story or not.<br /><br />I'm giving this a 2 star because I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it.  I however would not recommend that anyone wast their time watching this!  While it did have an interesting story, it was poorly executed.

0553277472|3|I read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance for the first time a couple of years after it was published, when the eye-catching pink paperback cover was new to bookstores (I remember my parents talking about that bold color while we were on our own long trip of some kind). At that time, I was more or less the same age as the son of the book's narrator, Phaedrus, and of course I could not help but interpret the story from the younger man's perspective: this was an adventure story about a cross country trip, a boy learning about his father, an introduction to a life led by beliefs rather than instinct.<br />Now, as an adult, I see things through Phaedrus' eyes -- which is to say author Robert Persig's eyes, since in terms of concepts (if not geography) it is considered autobiographical -- and I can recognize many of Phaedrus' musings and thoughts as those of a man who is at once confident of and also seeking his place in the world.<br />The book is best known as a tribute or sequel to Henry David Thoreau's Walden, which Phaedrus refers to at several points. Others have pointed out, for example, that the protagonist's long (and not too interesting) discussion of what he carries in his knapsack recall Mr. Thoreau's own endless lists of the materials used to build his lakeside shack or the seeds he planted for his sustenance.<br />But there is much more to this book than that. The provocative blend of Eastern and Western thought, the way he generalizes regarding his philosophical predecessors (and gets some things wrong), the conclusions he draws and the way he sometimes fails to follow his own advice -- they blend to create a picture of an intelligent, complex, and flawed character. Not unlike many of the book's readers.<br />Maybe that is a key to the book's lasting impact -- at least to this point. Like Walden, the book has practically become an icon in the decades since it was published. A quick scan on Amazon reveals dozens of books using the title Zen and the Art of something ... of knitting ... of making a living ... of archery ... of falling in love ... of poker ... of day trading ... even of the actual maintenance of motorcycles.<br />But unlike Walden, I think the high water mark for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has come and gone. It was an interesting and compelling re-read for me -- as it would no doubt be for others -- but as I worked through it I started to realize that much of its appeal was as a philosophical time capsule, a glimpse at a time when the globalization of ideas was still new, when East and West were further apart than they are today. Take that away and most of what is left is an adventure story about a cross country trip, a boy learning about his father, an introduction to a life led by beliefs rather than instinct. And that's not so hard to find elsewhere.Art of something ... of knitting ... of making a living ... of archery ... of falling in love ... of poker ... of day trading ... even of the actual maintenance of motorcycles.<br />But unlike Walden, I think the high water mark for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has come and gone.

B007H51DQG|3|*spoilers*<br /><br />Poor Dale, he was such a humanitarian; a real Mensch and likable character. I think the group really took him for granted and killing off his character was an epic fail on part of the writers as he was not only a likable character but also represented a balancing force in the dynamic of the group. Now they are left with the trigger happy hanging judges that run the group and it's going to be hard to water down the intensity of their polar opposite points of view. And if rumors of serious cast changes are true, more deaths are to come as we approach the season finale.<br /><br />I noticed that in this show most of the characters are beginning to behave in a way designed to service a desired plot outcome (like Carl attracting the Walker to get Dale killed) instead of the plot responding to the characters. For example, Lori and Rick must be just about the dumbest parents ever. Who lets their kid (that was just recently shot), wander around unsupervised in a world run over by the flesh eating undead? ESPECIALLY after what happened to Sophia. I mean that stupid kid was wandering the woods, climbing into the barn with Randall yelling \\"I am a man, I can take care of myself\\", was almost eaten by a Walker and not once did his dumb parents wonder where he is. That is not very believable and was obviously put in there to service the desired plot outcome.<br /><br />And then that kid Randall: they all act like there was NO alternative to execution, just so the writers can put the characters in a situation where they have to contemplate his execution. But there were other options besides murdering the kid and the writers DIDN'T do a good job at showing us that they really had exhausted all those and had to now consider execution for lack of a better alternative. It wasn't believable and again, put in there to service the desired plot outcome.<br /><br />The logically incoherent rules and reversals of elements according to whether they need them in an episode is also annoying. The Walker that attacks Carl is not strong enough to pull his feet out of the mud and is barely able to wrap its paws around him, but just a few hours later tears a man's chest cavity open with his bare hands? I didn't think that was even possible. A wild animal with claws needs to put more work in that but in this case the Walker just went through Dale like a hot knife through butter. And where did that stealth zombie come from anyway? One moment we see Dale walk in an open field with no one is sight for miles, next minute a clumsy Walker is standing behind him.<br /><br />Hershel goes from \\"No guns and violence on my farm\\" to \\"meh, kill whoever you want, I dont care\\". And for Rick, the decisive reason not to cold-bloodedly murder someone is not what Dale said, but that his kid is watching, whom he just five minutes ago asked to never ask any questions or disagree with anyone, no matter what. Are they kidding me? The dialogue in this dhow must have been written by juvenile boys. It is conpletely devoid of any kind of substance, wit and insight. The writers have gone from quoting William Faulkner in season 1 to Lori giving Andrea a hard time for not being a good submissive woman who knits and does laundry for the big strong men and Rick telling his kid, whom he never even asked what he actually said to Carol, to just summarily shut up and never ever ask any questions or question anyone. Great values to instill on your kid. This show should seriously be the called A/-holes on the Zombie Farm, because that is what most of the characters are.<br /><br />It is also insulting that T-Dog, who did have somewhat of an interesting role in season 1 (and even beginning season 2) and actually had meaningful conversations with other people, barely ever appears anymore and when he does, he is standing in the corner quietly. I think his \\"what do we do with the body\\" single line was the most he has said since episode 3 of this season, which just points to the overall crappy cheapness of this show (dont have to pay actors that dont talk much or are seen, same location...). T-Dog's role in the show and group has been reduced to that of doing the grunt work. Sure, let the token black guy take orders from king Rick and queen bee Lori. What's gonna be next? let him be eaten by zombies?<br /><br />They should bring the focus back on the apocalypse and what caused it and survival and leave the farm and they should use zombies as another character in the show - as Jenner did - instead of as just props that pop up every now and then so that the producers and writers can check it off their list of things to do. Didn't Rick see a helicopter when he was in Atlanta? Whatever happened ot that? Seriously, it seems like the writers are making this up as they go.<br /><br />The previews are unfortunately showing that we are going to go back to that Rick/Lori/Shane triangle and I just don't care about these peoples' personal issues. No one does. The world has come to end, get over yourselves and your petty affairs you selfish dolts. Why couldn't they have gotten rid of Lori? Everyone's problem would be solved if Lori was gone, because let's face it, as the Alpha, Rick is acting like the judge, jury and executioner to prove to the other Alpha, Shane, that he can take care of the water hole and his mate.<br /><br />I hear something about the comic's nemesis The Governor making his way through season 3. So then it will be this group vs. the Governor's gang. Like Boys in the Hood but in a zombie setting. Yawwwn. Been there, done that. Not very original.<br /><br />And hey, if you run into a group that looks like they wanna hurt you, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. No reason to waste 22 episodes on it and artificially build the story around it.  It is not like there is only one patch of land left for all of humanity and these people had to fight for it. Again, the writers are artificially extending these peoples' struggles by creating directions and \\"issues\\"that don't make sense. this isnt south central LA. You dont like, move on.<br /><br />As to Dale, story wise, maybe it is better he died. He wasnt going to make it in this world. He pretty much lost out on the execution debate as no one had his back and thought he was some naive and delusional old guy. And he said that he didnt want to live in this kind of a world anymore. So his demise, while tragic, was his peace.<br /><br />If they do that with too many characters, though, I suspect alienation by fans. People are drawn to not only the story but also characters and historically shows that have gotten rid of major characters ended up alienating the fan base, eventually facing cancellation. That and please gt/fo of this farm. And goodbye Jeffrey DeMunn, loved your character.
B001SMC91M|4|I love the sound of this band, but after awhile, Joe's voice really starts to grate.  The instrumentation is great, I love the horns, and Joe is a great guitar player and songwriter (for the type of sound he's aiming for), but he just doesn't have much vocal range.  That said, I'm really surprised a couple of these songs haven't found their way onto some 1970s period movie or TV soundtrack.
B004H4XDBI|5|Loved this book after &#34;If I Stay.&#34;  I enjoyed reading from Adam's perspective. Definitely worth the read. Highly recommend for everyone.
B008Y7J91M|5|Very well done and wonderful attention to detail in the costumes and customs of that day.

B000T00PE2|5|I think this is one of the milestones in trip-hop. Dissolved Girl, Angel, Black Milk and Teardrop are songs that will live forever. Must have.
0316204366|5|although it is still worth reading. as always malcolm brings to light very interesting ideas and perspectives, which are always a treat to read about. great conversation material until you realize your hot girlfriend can't contribute to an interesting conversation LOL am i right, fellas?
B003O86FMW|5|Another gripping adventure that kept my attention to want to turn the pages.  There was suspense, love and drama and lots of symoblism which catches up to the third book which is a must read as well.
B00F8L2VO4|1|not for me
B00O7UED2A|5|This game is fun and creative
B008IJTFYW|5|works better with big comfy headphones.  like beats by Dre.  had it during a road trip while people were listening to radio I was asleep.
B00GINENG0|1|I loved playing this game, I paid for it, I was at level 50, I had a lot of the royal items, I was leveling up fast, earning a lot of coins on the games, it gave me something to look forward to. Then the game crashed and closed on me, and I lost everything, even the fact that I paid for the game, I tried contacting the makers of the game and it got me nowhere. So beware and don't count on out fit 7 to help!
B00B2DSK06|1|Have not received my DVD so I can give a recommendation about what I purchased so for now I'm not very happy
B00T3DNKIE|4|While Harper Lee's voice is ever present, it was not as enjoyable a read as the first person account of &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird.&#34; The book was a bit too political and angry for me to find the pleasure reading &#34;Go Set A Watchman.&#34;
B004LWZWGK|2|this was not a good movie. bad catwomen along with a bad story line. really the police are living under ground? they put cat women in a mans prison? you dont think all the excons where rapeing and killing all the civlins?? they would have been no city for him to come back to! and how in the hell did he make it back to the city so fast? he had a broken back with the bone out! they punched it back in, he could not beat bane when he was better but then got a broken back and could not lose. baddddddddddddddd movie! and that was just a few problems with it
B00BI5IXL4|4|If you haven't seen this movie you need to!! It makes me cry every time!! The two things I don't like about it are:<br />1. I don't love Russell Crow's singing voice<br />2. Don't love Anne Hathaway as an actress<br /><br />It is super easy to get past those things though and LOVE everything else!
B0015D3Z4O|3|Madonna is one of the few artists who consistently delivers new styles (musically and physically) and refuses to release anything that rehashes its predecessors.  \\"Hard Candy\\" is certainly no exception to this icon's ever-changing repertoire.<br /><br />For the most part, \\"Hard Candy\\" is entertaining and well done.  Only a couple of tracks (\\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Spanish Lesson\\") really make you run for the Skip button on your player.<br /><br />Even Justin Timberlake and Kanye West can't seem to pull their tracks up from the dreaded \\"that was just okay\\" territory.  But that's not to say there aren't some exceptional tracks.<br /><br />For those of you who would prefer to buy your albums song-by-song, please note that \\"Heartbeat,\\" \\"Miles Away,\\" \\"Voices,\\" and \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" are definite hits amongst an album of almost-but-not-quite songs.<br /><br />Yet even these handful of addictive songs never quite reach the musical brilliance of Confessions, nor do any have the stunning emotional depth of Ray of Light.  Nevertheless, this is not a throw-away album and is still worthy of a good spin.
B004EXLDFU|1|Such a stupid plot twist completely killed the development of the entire story line.  Olivia who is trapped in the alternate universe, risks everything to break into the lab, and for a moment manages to cross back into her universe, just long enough to beg a night cleaning lady to pass on a vital message to Peter.  Cleaning lady calls Peter late at night and passes on the message, stating that real Olivia is trapped in the alternate universe.<br /><br />Having such vital, game changing piece of intel, Peter gets up in the middle of the night, to SNOOP around like a little boy, and then decides to just randomly type in passwords to hack planted Olivias laptop...<br /><br />Yeeeaaap.  This is the dude thats been doing all kinds of shady, under the table deals in every nasty crevice of the world, and instead of soundly going to sleep, so he can safely burn her the next day, or I don't know, maybe even run surveillance on her for EVERYTHING shes got, nope, he's going to immediately tell her that he knows she's a plant.<br /><br />Further more, while under her gun, Peter proceeds to INJECT himself with unknown compound, simply because planted Olivia is forcing him to.  He does kind of inquire if it'll kill him, but I guess for a fella that feels right at home in places like Iraq, doing something to him self that'll conveniently look like a suicide, apparently makes total sense.<br /><br />This kind of a plot twist, is simply insulting, and after that scene they could have cut away right to ScoobyDoo.  I don't care that for some reason injection was not deadly, and Peter is going to wake up, none of that matters.<br /><br />Once story credibility is blown, there's no way of recovering it.  The entire development of the series was turned into a cheap joke literally in a matter of 7 minutes.<br /><br />Peters character was positioned as the prime focus point of the whole plot, he's the one who is supposed to activate the next phase of the operation, and he is a complete idiot.  From this point on, he might as well walk around in a sagging diaper while sucking on his thumb.<br /><br />Ludicrous waste of time.
B007SYWFRM|5|Wife loves
B0087JTAKW|5|This is not a long book, but it is long enough to tell the story.<br /><br />An old man is dying, and a young girl is defining her worth by the opinion of a teenage boy.  They don't seem to have much in common, but they do.  One values time too much and the other too little.<br /><br />This is a riveting read. I finished it in one day.
B0034DGPEU|2|After enjoying The Help, I was very excited about reading this next book. The setting was rapidly set and I was engaged in this book. Sadly, the characters were trite and poorly developed. I kept expecting them to get deeper and more interesting but to no avail. This book is too long and too shallow.
B002QGUFWE|5|Lady Gaga is everywhere now compared to a year ago, and I really think she deserves it, her music is great. This album is great to sing along to, and dance to, you can have a lot of fun listening to Lady Gaga. If you are sad, and then listen to this album you will be happy again, she makes my day. I really enjoyed The Fame, a lot so I am glad she released The Fame Monster the different side of her which is great. I love her lyrics. This is a have to have album of 2009. Lady Gaga reminds me of Madonna, Britney Spears, and Gwen Stefani all mixed into one musician. Lady Gaga is very talented, and I hope she is around just as long as Madonna has been.
B00BLSJI80|5|This album is perfect. It's my second favorite of hers because unbroken I have to say is a little better. My favorite and most overplayed tracks from this album are \\"Heart Attack\\" \\"Really Don't Care\\" \\"Neon Lights\\" and \\"Warrior\\".
B000QUEHOO|2|[[ASIN:0143117009 Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed: Revised Edition]]    This is a fascinating book, but do not buy it on the Kindle.  The text references a series of plates, and images. Most of them are not included on the Kindle version.  None of the hyperlinks work.  I feel like I bought the book but many of the pages are blank.  I am sure it is a much better read in print.  I am used to the many annoying typographical errors, but leaving out content is absurd.
B001KZG99A|5|Great movie!
B00005R2IS|4|I loved the fact you had the opportunity to watch the American dubbed version I watched as a kid! Great DVD.
B001KQZ7I8|5|I first read this book in college, as a psychology major.  A few years later I loaned the book to a friend going through a tough time in his life.  He loved the book and said it helped put things into prospective.  He never returned the book.  So when I had some difficulties come up in my own life, I went looking for the book to read again.  I've recommended this over the years to many friends and family members.  The basic concept of having a purpose in your life gives you strength to get through the tough times in life, is really the kernel of this entire book.
B004SVM7BW|1|There are better alternatives. I tried this because it was a weekly freebie with Amazon Appstore. I didn't really like anything about it.
B002P4VUMQ|5|Every song on this album is excellent, and the quality of the CD and DVD are well worth the price of admission!
B00J2VSS0C|4|I think it's amazing I love mystery apps and trying to find hidden objects but some of them I don't even know what they are. Well I'm<br />Only 9. I would rate 100 stars if it was a bit easier.

B000008HPE|4|Once Huey Lewis and The News took control of their sound on [[ASIN:B00000JCFP Sports]], their canny blend of R'N'B, Rock and Pop made them superstars. They established themselves as a first-class live act, their videos were polished and clever, and as a front man, Lewis had become a star in his own right. The follow-up was \\"Fore,\\" an album that seems a bit caught up in its own desire to please and sound serious, losing some of the fun of \\"Sports\\" but still having enough ace craftsmanship that two of the songs went to number one.<br /><br />Lewis and the band were far from over-night sensations, so the musicianship was already focused and top-notch. But the album sounds a bit too professional at times, stuck in the \\"everyman\\" mold a bit too obviously to sound like the hungry happy-go-lucky's that \\"Sports\\" made them out to be. Two of \\"Fore's\\" biggest singles lay that point on pretty thick. The number one \\"Stuck With You\\" is a smart and somewhat cynical look at romance where the couple stays together not out of love, but because it's easier not to break up. Then there's \\"Hip To Be Square\\" where, without a trace of irony, the band extols the virtues of conformity while backed up with a chorus of pro football players. It's catchy and funny, but it is hard to be a \\"square\\" when you're hamming it up with Super Bowl champs.<br /><br />However, talent wills out all the way through \\"Fore.\\" The pop of \\"Doing It All For My Baby\\" is terrific, as is the acapella \\"Naturally.\\" \\"Simple as That\\" is corny but closes the album on a solid note. And as cynical as I am about \\"Hip To Be Square,\\" there is no way to get caught up in just how fun and catchy the thing is. \\"Fore\\" is the sound of a band seizing their moment in the sun and enjoying the heck out if it. There's no reason you shouldn't enjoy it as much as they are.
B000A7DVR2|5|I'd seen this movie many times, and thought it was &#34;high time&#34; I had my own copy!  The Dude does not disappoint!  A crazy wild ride but intensely satisfying......
B001I45UFC|5|I just read this book to my seven year old and we both loved it.  We can't wait  to watch the movie and I can show her that the book is always better :)
B009YQJ322|5|It's too bad this movie was preceded by that Stallone piece of garbage. This movie was great. It kept to the dark and uncaring world of the dredd comics. Some folks complained about the Judge uniform, but they need to remember that (A) this uniform did resemble some earlier variations seen in the comics and (B) they wanted to give the movie a more realistic feel that anyone could accept, not just prior readers. Other folks complained about the Lawmaster (Judge's motorcycle) but there's nothing you can do about that. There's just no way to build that and make it rideable. There were other nitpicks, but the bottom line is they did an excellent job making a movie that pleased readers and non readers. For those who wanted a little more insight into Dredd and Mega City One politics, lets hope they make a sequel.<br />Just get the \\"Judge Dredd\\" movie out of your head and give \\"Dredd\\" a chance. I bet you'll be glad you did.
B009KS4XRO|5|This game is great for some simple fun.  Helps to relax after a harsh day
1476746583|2|I have so many friends who loved this book that I jumped to buy a copy. I'm not fond of long books written in the present tense, but I thought the book would redeem itself in spite of my bias. Alas, it was not the present tense that put me off, nor was it the fact that the plot hopped between two characters, one in France the other in Germany. Rather, it was the structure of the book itself that was unnecessarily confusing. The book is broken into 13 &#34;parts&#34; titled by date, that are further broken down into &#34;sub&#34; chapters that hop between the two characters. Ok, so far so good. But why, then, were the &#34;parts&#34; out of chronological order? For example, Part Six (8 August 1940 is followed by August 1942). In Part Six the character, Bernd, dies. In Part Seven, two years earlier, he is alive? What's the point of this? A good plot damaged by poor editorial choices.
B00000I8NC|5|\\"Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada,\\" the second release from the brilliant Godspeed You Black Emperor, is a 30-minute EP that is probably the band's most mainstream friendly release.<br />And when we're talking about 30 minutes that bend, swirl, explode, buzz and drone as an extended wall of sound, that's saying quit a bit. Because this stuff isn't mainstream AT ALL.<br />It is, however, possibly the best introduction for a newcomer to the band, more rooted in traditional noise rock than their other releases, and easily digestible at just 30 minutes or so.<br />Trying to describe the music of Godspeed You Black Emperor is like trying to describe a dream. You can offer an accurate description, but actually capturing the essence is difficult. One must experience it firsthand.<br />So, too, is the music difficult to describe. You can describe the instruments and how they go about their business, but until you hear it, you won't have a clear picture of what this band is all about.<br />Built upon layers of instrumentation by a band that is at times more than a dozen members strong, Godspeed You Black Emperor, or Gybe for short, mix airy, noisy guitar with strings, sound collages, piano, chimes, and much more. They take fairly simple musical themes and, using this vast array of sounds, build them up over a long period, morphing simple melodies until they metamorphosis into something wholly different than what they began as. This isn't simply droning, lulling music. The effect is a journey.<br />One could liken Gybe records to soundtracks for films that have never been made. It's a description that works, because their music conjures images in your head.<br />This second release is more focused that the first album. Here, rather than the mish mosh of smaller pieces and collages strung together on the first record, this EP shows Gybe evolving into what they have become, working out what is essentially a single piece (despite \\"songs\\" being listed) over 30 minutes. The music rises and falls. The layers here are dense and thick, rising and falling like a tide. Strings swell up and dominate, and then guitar takes over, and then some twisted sound effect. Transition pieces are overlaid with the spoken words of an insane man.<br />If it all sounds very anti-radio, it is. You won't find this stuff on a top 40 station.<br />Godspeed You Black Emperor is a superb band for those who enjoy lengthy songs, sprawling soundscapes and music you can sink into. It's a heady experience listening to this stuff. And it's worth it.
B009D0LBRO|5|I love Rayman Origins.  I actually got the platinum trophy for it on the Playstation Vita because I finished every little thing I possibly could.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this mobile game, as it is similar to Origins, but unique.<br /><br />Rayman never stops running - you just control when he jumps and punches.  It simplifies things for the mobile platform, but allows enough flexibility to keep the levels challenging.<br /><br />I enjoyed this game enough that I finished all 40 levels, including the extra-hard Death levels.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes platforming games.
6304698798|5|This theatrical version cut some of the flab while still keeping it epic. Why they didn't include it on the blu-ray, I don't know. Oh well...
B000000XB9|5|Very happy with the CD.  I think any Creedence fan would like it. Sure brought back some good memories.  I will not pretend to be some audiophile geek, but I think the CD sounds just fine.  Long live CDs!!
B00C7KYXHW|5|Excellent!!!!!!
B003LQ3YXU|5|I've been hearing good things about this series so I finally watched it. I love watching sci-fi any sci-fi watcher will love this. I was curious how the can change The Doctor, found out during the last scene of the last episode of season 1. Can't wait to start the next season.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Omg I can't stop playing ...insanely is the word for this game . Love the graphics.I got a buy some tokens..Love the challenges and just a ball around fun game.
B000HZD168|5|the best star trek ever
1577314808|5|This book written by Eckhart Tolle is a beautiful and astounding read. That's it. There's nothing else more to say about it.
B000AGTPUK|5|Robert Zemecki's take on the popular children's classic is a visually stunning and heartwarming tale of faith and belief.  Though the story itself is somewhat thin, the animation is brilliant.  Never has animation seemed so lifelike, with loving detail to character movements and gorgeous alpine scenics.  Tom Hanks lends his brilliant vocal characterizations and physical appearance to several roles, most notably the conductor and the mysterious hobo.  He is of course also the embodiment if not the voice of the hero boy.  The movie's message is clear:  if you believe, then everything is magically possible.  The trip to the North Pole is fraught with misadventures and once there, the magic of the landscape and the North Pole is breathtakingly captured.  Alan Silvestri contributes a fine score even if the BELIEVE song is a little maudlin, but deemed Oscar worthy as performed by Josh Groban.  Nona Gaye also does nice work as the hero girl and Eddie Deezen is a great know it all.  In time, I think this groundbreaking joy will be a Christmas classic.  The whole family should enjoy this one.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Enjoyed.
B002ZG98J6|5|loved it, action and adventure.
0385338724|3|I  guess it would have been okay if you have never read one of her books before but I'm starting to think that she only has one writting style and that a thirty something woman is going to end  up with a rich guy. The end. Save your reading time for some Emily Giffin.
B00DUGCLY4|4|This game is fun but I hate when I get stuck on them and its so hard to guess what they are
B0063GORYU|5|I have played this game for a couple years now so can really recommend it.  Sometimes  it's a real  challenge but not enough that it is discouraging<br />Don't hesitate to try it.
B00TB5O7UY|5|Love Hollywood Undead
B00ADQPA38|5|Great show .
B008QTVNUI|5|The best show on tv at this time. The multiple stories and fast paced twists keep my attention riveted. Can't wait for the next episode each week.
B0058U0160|5|One of the best
B00571F26Y|4|this book is very insightful,  technical, and offers good advice I believe.  In a country where every aisle is loaded with carbs of some sort or another, reducing the gluten we eat is something we should be looking at.  My only problem with the book is that is tends to drag on and repeat itself a lot, sometimes making it a tedious read.
B006C1DH92|3|mean it is the same Thang as all the rest of fruit kings except fruit hinge is free in stead of 99&cent;
B004QOB8SO|5|I loved this series, but was disappointing that there were only three episode in this season. They should have made it longer, and left the ending open for that possibility. A must own.
B0002S947K|5|This can't happen.  This isn't true.  It's not possible.  A guy wakes up one day to his alarm clock playing a Crosby, Stills, and Nash song and it is so powerful that he knows what he is meant to do and that is to become a singer songwriter and make a fantastic debut album.  That's exactly what Ray LaMontagne has done here.  He taught himself to play guitar and to sing \\"from the gut.\\"  Having a tough upbringing is perhaps good fuel for writing great songs but being able to actually write and sing those songs like Ray has done is just unbelievable to me.  When I first heard him I thought he was black because he sings with such soul.  He's a white guy who really does sing from the gut.  He sings from deep down in the essence of his troubled soul.  This album has some redeeming qualities.  It isn't all about \\"trouble.\\"  Ray's answer to life's inevitable problems is through love.  Their is some melancholy here but it is balanced by a romanticism as in the line \\"I would walk miles through broken glass just to fall at your feet.\\"  All the songs are great but a few of my favorites are: \\"trouble,\\" \\"forever my friend,\\" \\"hannah,\\" \\"how come,\\" and \\"jolene.\\"  I am thoroughly impressed by this debut and I look forward to hearing more from this soulful singer.  This isn't a very good review because any attempt to describe how great this album is will fall short.
B0054NQZ9S|4|Good movie, well played but somewhat typical.  We had a difficult time with seeing it as it kept having to download.  Is this a common issue with streaming?  Amazon?
B0015OKWL2|5|Excellent partnership -- again!
B001UTW7QU|4|Loved the show and wanted to revisit the beginning. Still catches you off guard.
B00C1BUYX4|5|Loved it
B004TI5N38|5|Excellent book.
B00GCE3TCE|5|The wording and phrases were actually delicious to read.  The author is heads above the rest.  I don't even want to see the movie.  I'm afraid it couldn't possibly hold a candle to the author's words.  This would be a wonderful book for two people to read out loud to each other.  I will be reading it again within the year.
B00DJ3ITKS|5|Having lived as an expat part of my life in latin-American countries with no access to English speaking books, I am eternally grateful to Amazon. Thanks to its existence, I have been able to order first physical books and later digital books and receive them in Venezuela and Bolivia. This book is an excellent read, showing us the early history of the company and it's founder, helping us to better understand Jeff Bezos as the main driver of the immense success of Amazon.
B00FAX6XQC|4|There's a deer hunt arcade game at the pool hall we frequent and I downloaded this game thinking it would be just like that. I was blown away by the advanced graphics and ability to upgrade weaponry. I even admit that I planned to share with my son but have been playing it so much myself he hasn't gotten a chance to play!
B000HEWEDK|5|Good Sci Fic film. There should be more films like this.
B000THCKHU|5|JT as a band has gone through a lot of changes. In their 20th aniv. 4 disc set, there is a small &quot;Family Tree&quot; like section, naming the members I think year by year. And despite what a lot of people think, JT is not ONLY IA.<br />This album in my view is their peak period, and along with  Aqualong is their best album. A lot of energy can be felt starting with the first note of MOUSE Police!, and then comes my personal all time favor; Acres Wild. On top of that there are JT's unique Acoustics like Moth and another JT masterpiece Living In the Hard Times. Oh did I mention another classic Bradford Bazaar?<br />A must buy, I am sure that long time fans already own it. I have the original Vinyl, 2 CD's an d this mp.3 set on Amazon from 2007, which is pretty well remastered.
B003JTHXOK|3|I am convinced Nicolas Sparks starts each book by imagining different ways to get women to cry.  This novel has the same tear jerker traps as the other ones although not as sappy as some of the others.  While the writing is techinically good the story seems a little tired and over done.  It was a very quick read.
B008Y6RGFE|4|Light, easy to watch, true entertainment.  Enjoy most of Will Smith's movies
B003YUC2FE|5|I bought this for my niece and nephew's 3rd birthday.  They watch them over and over again.  It is good to get the DVD copy as well because most cars cannot run the blue-ray.  Nice to have a copy in the car and at home.
B006Z1GLHO|5|Best Show ever<br />Can't stop watching
B009ZQC7MY|5|I am addicted to this show! It's just so interesting, lots of characters, good and bad, takes you back to how life really was all those years ago
B00DAXXRTA|2|HD version took long a time to play. No wonder same cost. But will HD skipped in the future version.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|Once you start, you won't want to put it down. Only complaint is that it's short. Completed it in about 2 hours, but definitely worth the price!
B005MMJ84K|5|Fast paced that keeps you turning page after page. Lots of twists and surprises. Far surpassed the first book, which I also loved.
B00688628M|5|Amazing, emotional, and the best series we've ever watched.
B000093NLE|5|Can't say enough good things about this vinyl album and the service from Amazon A+!
B0097BTSSS|5|LOVE this album and I'm so happy to add this to my vinyl collection. Can't complain about a single thing.
B006FE83UE|5|We have always loved To Kill a Mockingbird because it has ties to my in-laws hometown. It is a wonderful story.
0345495004|5|Although this story is fiction, it is based on truth.  This book tells the story of Frank Lloyd Wright's relationship with his wife and family and his clandestine love affair.  Insights into this famous man, interesting.
B0000DJYQQ|4|A stones must have.
B000Q9IZ5C|5|Nice edition to my Firefly collection.  Of course I would buy the 14 dvd set of expanded words from Joss if it was for sale!
B0064MPXFA|4|Getting interesting!
B000PC6A3E|5|Needless to say, this movie is a fantastic origin story of one of the most widely known icons in American popular culture. The disc itself is a must have for blu-ray owners as it is full of the obligatory behind the scenes features. It is an absolute must have for Batman fans as well as movie-buffs. Here's hoping that there will not be a rerelease with even more features, but unfortunately you never really know.
B001NLKZUA|5|I like this book as well as I did the rest of the series. Keeps my interest and wanting to keep reading till the end.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I love how this game let's you be an animal or person you want to be and how you can jump on Lilly pads and logs. I really recommend that you have this game! 😃
B002VECM72|5|It  was wonderful to see a movie with family emphasized; and non-dysfunctionable. S Bullock is terrific. I'm a real sucker for true stories and this movie didn't disappoint me even for a minute!
B000002B2T|5|This CD rocks.. and for those of you who only know of or have ever heard &quot;River of Deceit&quot; this album goes way deeper than just that track.  In fact if you didn't know any better, you would think this is an A.I.C. album, it's just that good. In my opinion all 10 tracks are pretty cool in their own respects. <br />¤¤¤~~R.I.P Layne~~¤¤¤
B00005YXZH|4|&quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; is my first experience with Wilco.  After reading all the positive press, I just had to see what all the fuss was about...now I see.<br />The word &quot;honesty&quot; is the first word that comes to mind when recalling this album.  The guys just lay it down, period.  Simple chord structures and innovative yet familiar melodies compliment eachother nicely here.  The songs vary from light, barely-strummed dirges to happy little rocking numbers.  The album is just a nice little change of pace from the norm...dig it.<br />Vocally, Wilco brings to mind Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips...thin, just barely in tune, not trying too hard...very direct.  Musically, I get Radiohead, Gomez, Flaming Lips, maybe even classic Beck.  Sit back and relish the melody.
B00003CXP1|5|This Movie actually deserve 6 stars I'm a 15 years old kid and this has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's not just it's an incredible movie. It has the amazing soundtrack by clint mansell
0393327655|5|If you are an atheist, you will love it.  If you are religious, it will make you mad.  If you are agnostic, it is good food for thought.  It is a good book. Regardless of your beliefs, if you find religion and religious history interesting, you should read this book.  I also recommend visiting the authors home page, [...]
B004SRNH10|5|I recently bought an Android Tablet and found that I needed Adobe Air to run certain APPS. Amazon offered the Adobe Air App for $0.00. It downloaded quickly and installed easily. Now I am able to run those APPS on my tablet with no problems. I appreciated Adobe Air and Amazon. *****
B005LAIHY0|3|Ridley Scott takes us once again on a dark journey to an alien planet that may be even darker than ALIEN.  Not only is the planet ominous and foreboding, but the space vehicle itself offers little refuge from the outside world.<br />Initially planned as a prequel to the ALIEN franchise, Scott decided to explore the origin of man, constructing a bold scenario to offer one possibility.  Parts of the script seem convoluted and while Noomi Rapace generates some thespian fireworks, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is too iconic to compare.<br />PROMETHEUS  is a visually stunning movie and the creature effects are fascinating and repulsive.  Michael Fassbender as the android David is excellent and Charlize Theron oozes ice as the evil corporate entity.  Logan Michael Green and Idris Elba lend good support, while Guy Pearce is unrecognizable in a small but pivotal role.<br />Two more PROMETHEUS films are planned which may answer some of the unanswered questions in this film.<br />PROMETHEUS is good film making that is also thought-provoking.
B003MZ0I84|4|There are a few tracks on this album that are not great (e.g., \\"Stutter.\\" What were they thinking?). But others (e.g., misery, never gonna leave this bed) are quite good. If you really like Maroon 5, buy this album. But don't expect anything like their first album, Songs About Jane. Definitely the best.
B00PSLQYWE|5|My fasvorite show, love those upitty brits!
B009JBZH54|5|What can I say?  Awesome trilogy at a great price!  By far the best acting Batman and vilans!  Definitely a must in your Blue Ray library!
B00CBRAD2A|4|Standard plot. Standard Arnold movie.
B00OX3F1JK|5|It was a fun read.  It kept going and added bits/twists at a good rate.  I enjoyed it enough to get book 2 and I will probably read the entire series.
B008ZOHCKE|4|This app is great, i would have given it 5 stars, but there are ads. These guys that are saying it stinks because the undo button?! Really?! It doesn't take much. This app is awesome. And it converts files to pfd, and so much more.
B00000JCOV|1|Slipknot has like 35 people in their band and their stuff is still simple enough for for a 4 man band to pull off.<BR>   <BR>   They wear masks for to reasons:  to get recognition and (according to a.c.) to hide the manly fluid stains on their faces. <br />   Do they think they are original using those vocals?  It's been done a million times and it was annoying the first.<br />   I noticed some moron called this CD revolutionary.  No, The Beatles were revolutionary.  People have been listening to their songs for 40 years and will continue for a many years more.  This is along the same lines as Papa Roach.  I once bet someone that in 2 years they will be forgotten.  I was in the 6th grade then.  Needless to say when I was in the 8th grade I got 15 dollars.  Slipknot will be done in 2-5 years.
B00H58VGIA|5|history & fiction beautifully woven together to create an exciting & emotionally riveting book. I could hardly put it down long enough to get anything done.
B00WV7TQDW|5|One of the best sitcoms ever made, as politically incorrect as you can get.
B00004ZAV3|4|While, it's the most complete collection of The Beatles' biggest hits to date, &quot;1&quot; still leaves us a huge feeling of incompleteness. By limiting it to just numer one hits, many of their biggest hits - &quot;Do You Want To Know A Secret&quot;, &quot;She's A Woman&quot;, &quot;Tiwst And Shout&quot; and most glaringly &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; - are not here. <br />Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love the songs here. You can't argue the timelessnss of numbers like &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, &quot;Come Together&quot;, &quot;Something&quot;, &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and the many others. <br />But still leaves a hairraising question: why couldn't this have been a boxd set of all their singles? A Boxed set would have pleased both casual fans and ones who have listened to them for years. The Beatles scored 70 chart entries between 1964 and 1996, and 32 of them made the top 10. With only 27 here, it leaves oom for more. I know it's going to take up space and proably won't get me any helpful vots, but here's a list of all the missing songs.<br />&quot;Please Please Me&quot; (number 3)<BR>&quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; (number 14)<BR>&quot;My Bonnie&quot; (number 26)<BR>&quot;From Me To You&quot; (number 41)<BR>&quot;Twist And Shout&quot; (number 2)<BR>&quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; (number 68)<BR>&quot;All My Loving&quot; (number 45)<BR>&quot;Do You Want To Know A Secrer&quot; (number 2)<BR>&quot;You Can't Do That&quot; (number 48)<BR>&quot;Thank You Girl&quot; (number 35)<BR>&quot;There's A Place&quot; (number 74)<BR>&quot;Why&quot; (number 88)<BR>&quot;P.S.

All these great hits are missing. Just hope that a boxed set will be released in the future.
B009ZQJVAK|4|Fun movie to watch even though slightly predictable but still fun. See Chweitel Elijifor (sp mistake) in a totally different role. He's a great actor!
B001JNNE64|2|I know we're all addicted to the idea of Director's Cut is far better than theatrical cut, Amadeus is not one of those movies(Dances with Wolves is another disaster). It was truly a great movie as it was.  So please don't deprive us with this Director's Cut only!  Give us theatrical cut or at least give us both version release.
B009ZQ8FQG|4|The inter-war years were quite interesting as a prelude to what followed in 1939.  This family is perhaps representative of their class in Britain, the servants certainly so, although change was coming slowly to that world.
B001DHXT6G|3|Have not watched them yet, so can't speak for the quality of the discs, but VERY  CHEAPLY packaging for DVDs.  Looks like they will get damaged if removed from case more than one or two times.
B0054JZC6E|4|Pretty good selection of games to occupy spare time. Some games are a little...stupid. But other than that, I'd recommend it to others.
0767802470|4|If you would like to know how life was on a German Submarine in WW2, then this is the movie for you. It will keep you glued to your seat.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who's interested in WW2 history and how the thoughts of German sailor's were not much different then our own.
B00IIUAPCM|5|I bought this for my mom for Mother's Day and she enjoys the whole album. I also like it. It's fun and poppy and appropriate for most listeners.
1250030951|5|Terrific story about a college freshman who is a fan of Simon Snow. Cath and her sister Wren have lived for their idol Simon Snow for a few years now and now with college, the two sisters are attending the same college but splitting up too. Wren no longer wants to live for their favorite star Simon Snow, nor does she want Cath to be her roommate but Cath doesn't want to let go. With things changing all around her including her relationship with her sister, Cath can't help but go places she doesn't necessarily want to go. A wonderful book about becoming an adult and the changing life of adulthood. One of the best teen books of 2013 and quite an achievement!
B000BPFBVW|5|I owned the SA-CD Version and liked that a lot, especially the surround sound. But the Monster Version does this much better.  And you'll have a bouns track, too. And some MP3 versions. And an iPod versions. And ... even the price is lower.
B00EGJ32A6|3|It's original but tries too hard to be strange and exotic. Maybe the remainder of the series will have more focus.
6304712944|1|Love the movie, but I've ordered this CD twice and both discs do not work!  Maybe it's because this is an older movie, but the movie plays and the music sound track but no words. I wish it worked, I'd like to see it.
B002KQ6BT6|1|I was very disappointed in this book. Read and loved the Da Vinci Code but this one is so incredibly bad. You have to suspend belief about the plot and the CIA's involvement. Hope in another 6 years he comes up with a better book.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Love it very entertaining

0060922583|4|Talbot's book reads like a pot-boiler.  I think I read it two sittings (the only other book that I read so fast was The Amityville Horror in 1978!).  Talbot weaves his theory that the universe is a hologram around findings in neuroscience and particle physics.  He then brings in every paranormal phenomenon one can think of to fit into this theory - reincarnation, out of body experiences, ESP, UFOs, psychokinesis, etc. etc.  This is both the strength and the weakness of the book.  While having a theory that describes all of these phenomena is like finding the Rosetta Stone, I found myself thirsting for alternative explanations as well, just to get a comparison.  But still, Talbot's book is a page-turner and is recommended.

B000002KNY|5|This is, by far, the coolest Talking Heads album ever.  It's music is dark and forboding, yet funky and dancable at the same time.  This CD is a collection of contradictions: from the electricity of &quot;Drugs&quot; to the torpor of &quot;Heaven,&quot; the Heads rip it up all the way.   &quot;Animals&quot; is a great song, and even better to listen to when  you've had a bad day  : )

B000JK8OYU|1|Man this is bad - so bad i would rather listen to the Backstreet Boys or Brtiney Spears. But it's the Beatles i hear you cry!!!! You wanna know why i think it's crap - because it adds nothing to their legacy and gives EMI or whoever a chance to make more money of their back catalogue. These mix-ups are not inventive or even vaguely interesting, just a few sound effects here or there. Save some money and buy say a Wings album like London Town or Red Rose Speedway if you need a new Beatles fix.

B0081BU42O|5|The Hydrogen Sonata is one of the last novels of Iain M. Banks before his death last June.  It's also the last &#34;Culture novel,&#34; one of a series of essentially disconnected novels about a galactic, post-scarcity civilization called &#34;The Culture,&#34; and the various other civilizations with which it shares the galaxy.<br /><br />I loved this book.<br /><br />While some people complain that Banks's Culture novels are all basically the same, I find every one of them to be distinctive and highly unique.  And while some themes may recur in multiple novels, each novel is clearly its own story, each examining those themes from different directions.  They're all wrought with outrageous yet exquisitely detailed events and spectacles, by turns lovely and gory.  Banks also paints different cultures beautifully; different enough to be startlingly alien, yet all with some tiny bit of familiarity to them that draws the reader in.<br /><br />For instance, in this novel, there is what might be best described as a space station that orbits a planet, but inside a kilometres-wide trough sliced round the planet's girth - the station actually orbits the planet below ground level.  I've been reading SF close to 50 years now, and I ain't ever read anything like that before!<br /><br />The plots are also ridiculously complex and worked out in stunning detail.  In this case, the plot revolves around the impending Subliming of the Gzilt, one of the non-Culture civilizations of the galaxy.  Old enough to have been around when the Culture was first created, the Gzilt have reached a point in their development that they're ready to evolve - every one of them all at once - beyond the physical.  This ultimate step of evolution, Subliming, has been mentioned in many of Banks's previous Culture novels, but never dealt with head on.  Till now.<br /><br />The Gzilt have a holy book, and a weird one at that.  It's a book that seems to fully outline all their major achievements with surprising accuracy.  But there is a distinct possibility that there is a perfectly natural explanation for the book's existence, and that explanation might, if widely known, cause all manner of ugliness.  The Culture, and especially the virtually omnipotent AI &#34;Minds&#34; that inhabit giant spaceships, regarding the Gzilt as one of its progenitors, feels some obligation to try to make sure things run smoothly during their Subliming.<br /><br />And so begins the intrigue.<br /><br />It's not possible to give a short description of the varied characters and roller-coaster plot that are involved in this story, so I won't even try.  I will give this one, entirely inadequate, example, though, just to whet your appetite.  A man some 10,000 years old - apparently the oldest man alive in the galaxy by orders of magnitude, knows the truth about the Gzilt holy book.  He had those memories put into extra memory enhancements in his eyes, then eventually had those eyes removed and replaced with an extra set of ears.  He gave his eyes, containing the memories of the secret of the Gzilt, to another person who wore them on a necklace - and who has 53 penises.<br /><br />Betcha didn't see that coming.<br /><br />What I found particular about the Hydrogen Sonata was that it dealt quite directly with Subliming - and it was written just before Banks died.  It is even possible that he knew he was ill as he wrote it.  I wonder if he wrote it thinking of the notion of death and the possibility of after-life.  While Banks was atheist, it does seem reasonable that his thoughts might turn to the finality of death, given the circumstances.<br /><br />Even if he didn't think that way while writing The Hydrogen Sonata, I certainly read it that way.  It was quite bittersweet, reading the novel as I did, knowing it was the last Culture novel I'd ever read, and I couldn't help but see it as a kind of manifesto by Banks about his thoughts on existence and death.  In the Culture, you can live forever,transferring from one body to another, keeping one body for centuries and another for only hours, having your mind Stored for awakening and re-embodiment under conditions you specify before being Stored, and where the body you assume can be pretty much whatever shape and size you want it to be.<br /><br />And then there's Subliming.  A completely mysterious state of existence, all but certainly real, only not in any sense we could appreciate.  Nestled somewhere in the onion skin of multiple dimensions and universes that comprise hyperspace in Banks's world, there is another existence to which whole civilizations can gain entry, assisted by Presences (whatever they are - it's never made clear) or by an appropriately powerful AI.  Sometimes, entities return to &#34;The Real&#34; from &#34;The Sublimed&#34; - like ghosts or angels - but are unable to describe in Real terms what being Sublimed is like.<br /><br />If this is anywhere near a reasonable reading of The Hydrogen Sonata, then its ending is surprisingly appropriate.  And that is all I'm going to say about that.<br /><br />Needless to say, if you like Banks's Culture novels, then you should love The Hydrogen Sonata.transferring from one body to another, keeping one body for centuries and another for only hours, having your mind Stored for awakening and re-embodiment under conditions you specify before being Stored, and where the body you assume can be pretty much whatever shape and size you want it to be.<br /><br />And then there's Subliming.

B00G6Q29KQ|5|Third book in the series. Read all three books in the span of one week and LOVED them.<br />Characters are likeable and some you care deeply about.<br />Be prepared to visit places that will challenge your imagination ( in trying to picture them) and places you would love to visit and spend time in.
0374105235|5|I literally just finished reading this book about 10 minutes ago and I am still amazed at how great this book was. Beah did an incredible job at keeping my attention throughout the entire book. Very easy to read but very hard to digest how a boy no older than 15 could have gone through so much tragedy.    The book comes to an abrupt end, but the meaning behind the ending is beyond moving. This book is incredible and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

B000W91RUG|5|Focusing on the lives of physicists, and geeky ones at that, does make for an atypical television series, but a great cast, original characters, and high quality writing, combine to produce a modern comedic gem.  Created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, it understandably took a little while for the creative team to develop the personalities of the characters.  But once the basic parameters were set, The Big Bang Theory began to boldly go where no comedy has gone before.<br /><br />With characters that always seem to be evolving, the series explores some unusual topics, and frequently heads into uncharted territory, usually making it impossible to predict what may happen.  This is one of the main reasons why this unique, goofy, show is so hilarious and captivating.  The creative team taps into facets of pop culture that may be associated with geeks and nerds (and teenage boys in general), and find ways to weave them into their stories, often in an exaggerated way.  Science fiction, comic books, superheroes, video games, television, action figures, paint ball fights, Star Wars, and the Star Trek universe, are just a few of the subjects that are featured.<br /><br />The cast is marvelous, with Johnny Galecki as Leonard Hofstadter, the shy guy enchanted by his new neighbor.  Jim Parsons is Sheldon Cooper.  If you look up the word neurotic, Sheldon's photo just might be there.  Simon Helberg is Howard Wolowitz, the delusional sleaze, who does still have his good points.  Kunal Nayyar is Rajesh Koothrappali, who can't speak to a beautiful woman unless he is under the influence of alcohol.  Kaley Cuoco is Penny, the girl from Omaha who moved next door, works at the Cheesecake Factory . . . . and changed their universe.<br /><br />Since Sheldon is off the scale when it comes to weirdness (what Penny would later come to describe as `whackadoodle'), and Wolowitz and Raj are arguably more `abnormal', Leonard seems the most sensible of the bunch.  Sheldon is totally unique, so bizarre in his beliefs, behavior and speech, that he seems at times to be from another planet.  Jim Parsons is a amazing comic talent, with a bright, bright future.<br /><br />Penny has a multi-faceted role.  One is as the primary female character, another is that she usually represents as close to a 'normal' persons' point of view as we will get.  As a link to reality, she is often the reference that shows just how wacked out the guys really are.  The times when she joins them in their world (such as when she fragged Sheldon on Halo night), are often some of the program's funniest moments.  By the end of the season, everything about the show is clearly peaking.  In `The Pancake Batter Anomaly', Sheldon gets sick, and Penny gets stuck taking care of him, rubbing Vaporub on his chest, and singing `Soft Kitty'.  In `The Bat Jar Conjecture', it's Sheldon's team versus the rest of the gang and Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert), in the Physics Bowl.  Sheldon's knockout of a twin sister arrives and makes waves, in `The Pork Chop Indeterminacy'.  Sheldon gets a look in the mirror, in `The Jerusalem Duality' when a young genius arrives on campus.  In `The Nerduana Annihilation', when Leonard buys the time machine used in the classic 60's film `The Time Machine' on eBay, Penny's  astute description is that `It looks like something that Elton John would drive through the Everglades'.  In the season finale, there's a glimmer of hope for romance for Leonard, in `The Tangerine Factor' when Penny agrees to go out with him.<br /><br />The Big Bang Theory is simply one of the most engaging comedies to come along in years.  Each episode seems to fly by, and leave you wanting more.  Some commentary tracks would have been cool, but the only bonus is the `Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory' a look at the creators, cast, and genesis of the show.  There are only seventeen episodes in the First Season due to the writers' strike.<br /><br />Things only get better in the second season, as the show's creative team continue to develop the characters, and introduce new elements to the mix, keeping things fresh and extremely funny.  As Sheldon Cooper might say, it is a foregone conclusion that the third season will be characterized by the same outstanding writing, and brilliantly quirky humor found in the first two seasons, continuing to keep The Big Bang Theory, at the cutting edge of contemporary comedy.ue to develop the characters, and introduce new elements to the mix, keeping things fresh and extremely funny.

B009AMANBA|3|Don't get me wrong, I enjoy historical dramas e.g. Barry Lyndon by Kubrick, and other movies based on historical figures e.g. Citizen Kane, Patton etc.  But I just found Lincoln to be too slowly paced and too much emphasis on passing the 13th Amendment rather than on the Civil War.<br /><br />Of course, it is a well made film with fine acting.

B00DR0PDNE|2|The quality of the video streaming is excellent and it does not lag behind at all. The problem I am having is that I cannot stream much at all from this device and think it is a waste of money!

0312263120|3|This was my first book by Dan Brown, and probably my last.  He wrote a minithriller, attemping the Clancy style.  I found the plot interesting, and I did have trouble putting down the book.  He wrote a passible thriller. <br /> <br />But the book impinges on several areas of my interest and even expertise, and it appears to be entiring uncontaminated by knowledge of the underlying technologies.  Any CISSP could have shown poked a dozen holes in the putative Internet security at the NSA.  In fact, if the NSA were that incompetent, Cuba would have overrun our republic years ago.  The bits of cryptography were technical gibberish, using real words in phantom ways.  And he misunderstands the difference between the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan. <br /> <br />My friends who have studied the middle ages have similar complaints about the DaVinci Code. <br /> <br />Still, despite the technical tomfoolery, I enjoyed reading the book. <br />

B00HJ92QTI|1|How in the world did this movie get so much praise?<br /><br />Watched bits of it with my family. They were much more interested than I.<br /><br />What a waste of time.<br /><br />None of us liked it. There are times we laughed out loud. The plot is utterly cliched, you knew exactly what was going to happen, and didn't feel at all for the 2 main characters. And for the empty silent void of outer space, the soundtrack was especially loud and annoying.<br /><br />OK ... I will give the movie this much: I bet it looks really nice on a big theatre screen. On my flat screen at home, not so much.
B0018PJEYY|5|I saw the Moody Blues perform shortly after A Question of Balance was released in the U.S.. The opening act was The James Gang whom had just released Rides Again.   Now... here is my question: Late January in 1973, my father and I were watching television when suddenly what we thought was a commercial came on screen. It was a jet fighter flying through beautiful sunsets and landscapes and the music playing was the whole uncut version of Dawning is the Day. After that, there was one minute of silence, then the program on T.V. resumed.   Did anyone else see this? My Dad still talks about it this day (He is 84) and laughs because he saw the first MTV video before MTV even existed.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Good book. Couldn't put it down.
B00B5HQL50|4|Contains the usual over the top 007 stuff but the cast makes it a movie to watch.  Hope you have a big screen TV to catch the action scenes if you stream or do the DVD.
0767803434|4|It's easy to understand why Air Force One was such a big hit. The President saves the country. America has an honorable man as their leader and he's saving them from evil again. Audiences walked out with pride in their hearts (fueled by Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score) and they forgot about the LewinskyGate scandal that was going down with the REAL President at the time.<br /><br />But the film is very good in it's own right too. Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension, Ford a likeable hero and Oldman as Korshunov, a rotten villain who was actually quite scary. The film is also very well put together technically. The editing and sound is top-notch, though some of the CGI is way below par for your average blockbuster. The R-rating helps. If this were made today it would be PG-13 garbage, but the blood spatters, swearing and body count make you believe that ANY character could die next.<br /><br />But there are flaws. And one BIG flaw. Some of the dialogue really sucks. And Wendy Crewson has a pretty bad role as the First Lady. The only reason her character is even in it is because the President needs to have a First Lady. Her role is totally useless. I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it. I am not kidding. Even Oldman at one point tells her to `SHUT UP!' echoing the feeling of every viewer.<br /><br />If you can overlook this minor, although highly irritating, glitch you will totally enjoy a high-octane action film with many, increasingly exciting, set-pieces. Very cool.<br /><br />And try to spot three villains from Beverly Hills Cop 2 and one villain from Beverly Hills Cop 3. They're all here.

B00QW8TYWO|4|Crosby road is really fun, and the graphics are amazing. The reason I rated it 4 star is because when I downloaded it, I got to play it once because it would be stuck on a picture of a chicken.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Loved it. With all the science that gets thrown around it is still broken down enough that some one without a doctorate in physics and chemistry is going to get this book (me), Because it is also about an incredibly funny intelligent scientist dealing with some really hard and traumatic circumstances. Poor guy is alone on Mars. Anyways they want Matt Damon for the movie so that should tell you how much action gets thrown at this guy. It was deffinately an edge of your seat book. finished it in a day, Didn't get much else done.

At first, I couldn't help but feel it to be somewhat of a waste (?) to devote one's entire life to the study of the ellipses \\"...\\" (cf.

0345529057|3|I, like many probably, purchased this after getting interested in the show on HBO. I enjoyed the show and it is done amazingly well, but the book is far, far better. I can only imagine how they are going to fit all the action from A Clash of Kings into such a short number of episodes (Well, to be completely honest they could probably finish up a number of the stories in the book in an episode or two since for a number of characters little of substance actually happens).     Anyways, I am currently in the middle of A Storm of Swords and have started noticing a couple of things. Namely, there are quite a few spelling issues that crop up throughout the book (I can only remember one or two from the first two). I can't say if this is also in other editions or not, but it really takes me out of the story when it happens.     I've also found that a number of pages are off-kilter, having been printed at an angle or near the edge of the page with little more than a 1/16\\" right-side margin. I understand this edition is mainly a cheapo version, but this is somewhat much. The cardboard container the books come in isn't exactly sturdy and is mostly just used for keeping the books next to each other, although there isn't much point to it otherwise. I don't treat my books harshly, but simply reading the first two books has caused noticeable damage to the spine and cover. A not insignificant portion of the covers, especially around the edges, has worn away and the spine titles are pretty much gone.     If you're thinking about keeping these books for any period of time or plan on reading them more than once it would be in your best interest to invest in a different edition. For the price, this is absolutely a must-buy if you're looking for cheap entry into the series like I was. If you're already a fan and want a set of books to keep, look elsewhere.

1455527475|5|I remember reading Greg Smith's Op-Ed piece in THE NEW YORK TIMES about his experiences at Goldman Sachs . . . this book, WHY I LEFT GOLDMAN SACHS: A WALL STREET STORY (Hachette Audio)--written and read by Smith--picks up where the newspaper account leaves off.<br /><br />It details the how the author progressed from a summer internship to become head of the company's United States equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Along the way, he describes how Goldman Sachs  went from taking  companies like Ford, Sears and Microsoft public to becoming a \\"vampire squid\\" that referred to its clients as \\"muppets\\" and paid the government a record half-billion dollars to settle SEC charges.<br /><br />Smith tried to bring about change, and he even had conversations with nine Goldman Sachs partners over a twelve-month period  . . . but when they proved fruitless, he came to believe that the only way the system would ever change was for an insider to finally speak out publicly.<br /><br />Smith's insights included advice he learned from the beginning of his career:<br /><br />* We had a rule still in effect for all interns. When you're in the elevator, don't say anything. You never know who might be in the elevator with you.<br /><br />In addition, he observed:<br /><br />* Additionally, casinos may be better regulated than some banks.<br /><br />And he expressed a belief that:<br /><br />* People should be outraged that there's no political will to fix a problem that hurts everyone, enriches a super minority that has learned to rig the game and  could threaten the world with another calamity in a few years time.<br /><br />That's scary stuff, but something that must be learned by us all to make sure that this type corporate behavior doesn't continue.

B0030Y11XS|5|Watch this film, period. Michael Moore has once again taken things that many of us just suspected instictively and provided the cold, hard facts. It's frank and it's very unsettling, but the message contained in this film is so vital to this country right now. If for nothing else, watch this movie for the segment on FDR's proposed Second Bill of Rights, which, had they been enacted would have made this country into a much better place than what we are witnessing right now.<br /><br />I am all for difference of opinion, but regarding the message in this film, anyone who is a detractor is part of the problem.

0385504225|3|In the Robert Langdon trilogy, The Da Vinci Code is definitely my favorite. As someone who unfortunately grew up Catholic and is now agnostic, religious conspiracy theories never fail to amuse me. Especially when churches try to ban the movie! Speak out against it, personally boycott it, fine. But banning it? That's just funny. So obviously I also loved Angels and Demons. While I enjoyed The Lost Symbol, I just didn't think it was up to the level of the first two. I still think it will make an excellent movie, however! And we need to finish our trilogy.<br /><br />Here were my problems:<br />1. Why did Robert have such a hard time believing everything unbelievable? He spent the entire first two books convincing other people of unbelievable things. Suddenly he's a total skeptic.<br />2. Why didn't anyone point out to the villain that if only the worthy could be enlightened, having someone else solve all the puzzles for him obviously meant he wasn't worthy? Just because he was going to tattoo the final answer on his head, what did it really mean if he didn't come up with the answer himself? (By the way, it's very difficult to cover tattoos with makeup. I find it hard to believe that he hid them on his entire body.)<br />3. I HATED that the Noetics research was saved. People died (lots of them), but the beloved research was saved. Were they really delusional enough to think this kind of \\"technology\\" and \\"advancement\\" was a good thing??? People are already capable of hurting each other from a distance these days due to wonderful advancements such as facebook and text messaging. I can only imagine what damage could be done once the world / the government / regular people have the power to do whatever they want with their minds. And we won't even have any evidence they were there.<br /><br />Besides that, the similarities to the first two books were what I enjoyed. The way all the elements came together...  the way all the puzzles suddenly made sense. I wish I could fit as much information into my brain as Robert Langdon does! Speaking of which, I'd hate to read a book like this for class instead of for pleasure. Boy would that make a nightmare test.s much information into my brain as Robert Langdon does!

0316322407|5|Gift for my husband. He read it in 3 days. Really big fan of Malala..(who would not be)<br />My next read as well. She is remarkable and what a role model and mentor for others<br />like her. Strong and courageous, against all odds. Living in fear forever.<br />Everyone should read this book. Learn what strong really is~
B00E8KLWB4|3|The magic pictures of hidden objects are visually interesting and beautiful.  Challenging--I'm at level 15 and doubt whether I can go much further since I don't plan to spend money to get the tools or energy required to progress.  Nonetheless it's given me many hours of fun with no annoying ads.
B000TFINY6|5|Love this show and we are buying and watching them again on blu ray. It's a great addition to any collection.
B005MLOOJA|5|I am so hooked!  Love this show!  Every episode is good, start to finish.  Can't wait to catch up to current episodes.
B000NA77YO|5|Great CD!  I already have the three albums/CD's that Black Sabbath recorded with Ronnie James Dio, so I mainly bought it to have the three new songs that were recorded for this latest release. <br />The new three songs are really good, so I am glad that I spent the money to purchase this new CD.
B009LDD1X0|5|The Boys (and Girls) on the Couch have done it again--Always Fun!!
B007XGJK4G|5|If you loved Bob Marley back in the day, you will love this in-depth look at an icon.  So many things, I, as an American fan in the seventies, never knew about Marley.  This is a  really wonderful, informative look at the man, his times, and his music.

B004222UC8|5|A childhood favorite of mine, and the Ray Gillen disc was awesome to hear for the first time!!!
B000002N3J|4|Well, judging from the past fifty or so reviews (!), I don't think I could say too much that is new, so I'll just give a simple opinion.<br />First of all, yes, some ballads are missing.  Personally, I think that the majority consensus that Crazy for You is unwelcome is right on the mark.  That could have been jettisoned to make room for something else that the general public is unfamiliar with.  Promise to Try and Love Tried to Welcome Me come to mind.  They could have even been daring, and included Bad Girl!  (discuss...)<br />However, you have to give the record execs credit for not leaving behind Oh Father.  The inclusion of that one song frees the complilation from being dismissed as just Adult Contemporary fluff.  And, it's my favorite Madonna song, by the way.  Another good choice was Something to Remember.  It had the misfortune of being on the kitschy Dick Tracy album.  Here, it really shines, even if Madonna can't quite vocally reach those high notes.<br />Some of you think that Live to Tell should have been left off, but it's too good to have been dismissed.  <br />That's enough, for now. :)
B0007GAERG|3|OK Ms.Mariah um........wha can i say with her powerful voice and producers like jermaine dupri and Neptunes its bound 2 be sum hot tracks on here but sadly i would have 2 say its only a few songs on here thants Worth listenin 2 i personally think Keyshia Cole album is better than \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" Because i just think there is no soulful singing on this album. <br />Did you see Mariah on BET i really hope her voice i alright she sounded really HORRIBLE on the Award Show <br /> <br />Like that 10/10 i jus love the beat and fat man scoop <br /> <br />We Belong together 10/10 best song on here and she tears the ending i guess letting evryone know dat da best selling female atrist is back 4 her throne <br /> <br />Shake It Off 10/10 I like the beat and its a  song 4 the radio dats it <br /> <br /> <br />Mine Again 10/10 what a beautiful song <br /> <br />Say Somethin' Ft Snoop Dogg 9/10 Neptunes wat a hott track <br /> <br />Stay The Night 9/10 <br /> <br />Get Your Number 4/10 this one of the annoying song SKIPPP this song plz your wasting yur time <br /> <br />One and Only 9/10 the vocals shoulda been betta on this song but its straight <br /> <br />Circles 10/10 Love the Vocals on this song i like songs like this songs that have meaning which is a few on this album <br /> <br />Your Girl 8/10  <br /> <br /> <br />I wish You Knew 7/10 its alright <br /> <br />To the Floor ft Nelly  3/10 this song is horrible i dnt know wat da neptunes was thinkin <br /> <br />Joy Ride 10/10 cute song <br /> <br />Fly Like a Bird 8/10 <br /> <br />not her best album i like the old mariah better i think yu should burn this album instaed of buying it lmao!!!! not wroth 15dollaz at all <br />BUY KEYSHIA COLE ALBUM instead \\"THE WAY IT IS\\" way better trust <br /> <br />overall grade B <br /> <br />im out <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00AIQP9DE|5|I have always enjoyed the g5 games. I love the mini games and the challenge of piecing together the puzzles and I really enjoy the story line of the mystery. I cant get enough...I play game after game after game.
6303422020|2|While it has its moments, this sequal doesn't even compare to the first one. The cartoons between the stories are embarrassingly lame, and the Indian story is awful. The Raft is pretty creepy, and I think the hitchhiker story is the only one that comes close to anything from the original.
014241543X|5|This book is so good! I read almost all of it in one day! Definitely recommend it!

B00E8KLWB4|5|Great game
B00GI8AMI8|5|I loved this game.  It wasn't too easy or too difficult.  Easy navigation.  Great looking screens.  I hope Echo Lake makes more like this.
B00632HWOG|3|If I could delete more and quicker at one time instead of the long process of selecting every email I'd give a bigger and better rating! Like all emails from $$$$ delete and they are deleted
B00CSR2J9I|4|When I first got this game I DIDN'T like it but now it is a challenge to get further and keep getting gas for the car which really duplicates MY life I always seem to be putting gas in my car. IT IS FUN AND EVERY TIME I FLIP THE CAR I CAN'T HELP THINKING I AM VERY HAPPY IT'S A GAME.
B00PZN5ZO8|4|Writing of another era. A mystery that evolves. Written from different characters' view points. Amassing the facts and truths. Kept me invested and interested.
B000002KK2|5|This music still holds up after all these years.
B00A4AIYHW|5|Sent this little buddy to a friend obsessed with marathon training as a mascot. She loved him, and so do I! He's super soft and his little track coat is well made with great attention to detail and stitching. So is he, he has a great little face and adorable detailing. He's itty bitty as the name suggests, slightly smaller than a beanie baby but much higher quality. He's a gund so he lives up to his name.
B001GKJ2DO|1|I grew up with ABBA through high school and they have always been a guilty pleasure so I was really looking forward to this movie. (I haven't had a chance to see the play.) What a disappointment. The singing was terrible (with the exception of the daughter) and the acting just as bad. I haven't seen a musical this embarrassing since \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" (which at least had decent singing but was still so bad it managed to effectively kill the careers of both the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton).
B000002H33|5|This is it, one of the greatest metal albums to have ever been created. Although many consider it to be Metallica's best, any album released by Metallica in the 80's is surely a candidate for best metal album ever. All 8 legendary songs in this album combine speed and beautiful harmony to make for an hour's worth of perfection. It all starts with battery and ends with the Damage Inc. From classics such as Master of Puppets to instrumental epics like Orion this album delivers all that a Metal lover would want.  Also look into Megadeth, Iron Maiden
B00K0X1PYM|2|While I appreciate Eric's effort to recognize jj's career the album sounds like a bunch of overdubs of previous recordings. I thank them all for their effort to eulogize one of my favorite singer/songwriters but would direct people to jj's first two albums, Natural and Really.
B00AB7HESI|5|This game is just as fun as the Nintendo DS version. Lots of fun! I can't get my husband to play any games with me, but this one he gets into! Awesome time :D
B00G9B1MEM|5|Too cute, and artistically addictive.<br />Good for children and adults alike. Worth every penny!!!<br />I've always loved claymation. It just brings back my childhood, and I've always held a destination for claymation
B00PB5AO4G|1|the game was fine till I got to level 10 and then it stopped working and just gave me a white screen.
B006PZBR8S|4|Fun story with cool effects.  Not too much thinking required; a nice fun story for an easy afternoon.  Lots of funny lines, though, and well worth watching.
0156030209|1|Disappointing.  Most of the other reviewers who characterize it in one-star terms, have described it well, in my view.  It starts to be a novel about an Indian boy whose family migrates to Canada.  He is investigating various religions and his developing adolescent thoughts are fairly engaging.  Close the book there, and you will be satisfied.  The rest is turgid.  You must slog through an allegory where he is marooned in a lifeboat with a tiger being transported to Canada to a zoo.  Sound good?  OK, well read it then.  I thought the whole book was fair, until then.  But once that narrative started...well, it went downhill, and fast.  I could read no more and discarded it.
B00AF6MF9I|5|Cool! It has war and weapons. You have to plan carefully and watch how your economy is doing. You have to plan your troops and attacks. Also make sure you have enough barricades at your base so that your safe.<br />This game is reccomended to people who like strategy, combat, warfare,economics, and weapons.<br />The end.
B00097DX3U|2|I will probably still buy the next Audioslave CD, if there is one, in hopes that the third disc will match the hard hitting R&R of the first one.  That said, 'Out of Exile' was a disappointment.  While the first album was one of the best sets released in the last 20 years - the second was a pale imitation of 'pop' music.  What happened?
B007URVZJ6|5|This book along with the Publish on Amazon book are the perfect team to help you succeed in publishing your book. Once I saw my book and the way it turned out. I was so happy..Check it out : A Pastry Chefs Recipes and Tips.

B00846REIS|5|This book was a real fun story.  The relationship between the main characters is so hot and steamy!  Can't wait to start reading the next book of this trilogy....
B00CWY76CC|5|Great game! Each level is so challenging! Cant wait to see what's in store for the next levels! Fun for all ages.
B00006JL1Z|5|Just what I wanted!
B00DR0PDNE|5|I had a friend show me one and decided it was pretty awesome.
B00WE2SMKC|5|This album is the best Adam has recorded! It is pop, but got some rock vibes too. Very different for him. I predict it is going to be a hit!
1892005034|5|a life-changing book. A very good and complete introduction to a compassionate way of communicating and relating not only to other people but also to ourselves so that we can allow the best in us to shine while we constructively work on our unresolved needs.
079073253X|5|Sleepers brings to the screen the story of four boys from Hell's Kitchen, N.Y., in the late 60's, who end up at Wilkinson School for Boys, where they are systematically and repeatedly abused by several of the prison guards. <br />It is a film about human relations, hope, and second chances, but most importantly about trust, innocence, friendship, divine justice, and inner strength.   <br />All the actors, (Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Kevin Bacon and Dustin Hoffman among others) without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few tears.  Consequently, it is an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.   <br />The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.  <br />I strongly disagree with the \\"official reviewer,\\" Jeff Shannon, about the film's \\"dubious emphasis on homophobic revenge.\\"  No further comment is needed... <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, Sleepers is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!
B006LSZECO|5|Takes a little bit to get into reading it...but great read! Amy is one psycho trip! Worth a read, enjoy!
B00005LK94|5|This is a fascinating story about the domestication of a flock of goslings.  They are returned to their natural life to the extend of teaching them to migrate by following human direction in a plane.  A young girl flies one of the planes and in the end she is flying alone when they reach their destination.  I believe it is based on a true story.
B009ZZDNT6|5|Good and practical app! Try it for yourself! It does work, even when my Kindle is closed which was my original concern-that it would not.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|This is a great app! For being a lite version it's just wonderful.
B009G8GRX6|3|This is an extremely disappointing album in every way imaginable. Muse try, but fail miserably, to experiment with electronic music (some lite dubsteppy noise, some electric-funk, and some other electricy gimmicks that don't work). The lyrics are trite, lazy, and very poppy in their lowest-common-denominator simplicity. I hoped desperately that the song commissioned for the London Olympics (Survivor) would not make an appearance and also wasn't an indication of what was to come but sadly both were true. Somehow this album ends up feeling conceited and self-indulgent in that these songs are what someone thought were worth someones money and what the fans who had made Muse the success they are actually wanted. Judging by the mostly positive reviews, it doesn't seem that was entirely off, so I'm afraid this may be what Muse is now.
B003V4AK8E|1|Since I´ve have bought things at Amazon website, I never had bought something so horrible like this. Simply it doesn´t work correctly. The motive for me buy this thing was the wirelles connection and this is the problem: it doesn´t work, but works only using a cable and works badly, because there´s not precision and there spontaneous movements that you don´t wanted. Exemple: turn right without you press the buttom.<br /><br />Controller<br />Fcc id: yfk—05108301<br />SKU: CPFA051083<br /><br />Usb Adapter<br />Fcc id: yfk—05108302<br /><br />I have charged the controll correctly and followed all instructions of manual.<br />I pressed the &#34;connection&#34; on the usb adapter and I see the light flashing rapidly. So I pressed the &#34;home&#34; on the controll, but nothing happened.<br /><br />I am so unhappy... My expectative was play using a interest and good controller, but thats is not corresponding.<br /><br />I would like receive my money back or another controller working properly.
B007N8RULO|4|I'm a spider fan and this is a nice version of the game.  It allows backing up without restriction (as near as I can tell).  It is easy enough to play on a phone, even with fat fingers.
B000L212HC|5|Excellent
B000SEJHRA|5|This book was hilarious. His writing is witty and insightful. Most of the time I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Hoping to have few more apps support for the. Extendable cable is not working as expected but overall its good.
0316033979|5|This book deserves to be a nominee for any award that you can think of.  It is not only unique and thought-provoking but well-written as well.  I am not going to summarize the plot for you.  That just takes away from the experience of reading this book.  I really cannot think of any other books that compare to this one.  This book is one of my all-time favorites and is a must read for anyone who likes to question the meaning of life.  I can't wait to read whatever Joshua Ferris comes up with next.
B002KSPKRS|5|This headset (Earforce x41) is comfortable to wear and the sound is fantastic! I can hear nuances in the games that I'd never heard before. For multi-player first person shooters you can really pin point where people are coming from - now if only my reflexes were better!     Have had these about a week so can't speak to longevity yet. But they hooked up easily, sound great and are comfortable.    A couple things to be aware of...  1 - there is a low level hiss when everything is silent. It doesn't annoy me when the game's sounds are on but it is definitely there during the silent times. I did try changing the frequency channel of my wireless router just to see (one reviewer had mentioned this) but it made no difference for me.  2 - The optical output is no longer coming standard on cables with new XBOX 360s. I have an older one with it included in the component cable and also an additional cable for audio use when using HDMI out. But without it you can also hook it directly to the optical out of your HD tv if using HDMI from XBOX to TV. Just wanted to make anyone who has a newer (post price drop) 360 that the optical output is not included in the cabling any more.  3 - when first hooking it up, the chat function seemed to echo and not work correctly. It turned out to be the cable into the headset from the controller wasn't all the way snapped in. I certainly thought it was at first but really click it in there and it has been fine ever since.    Do wish the chat function was also wireless, but I guess we can't have everything. I'd gotten used to using the 360 wireless earpiece and having the connecting wire back is an adjustment again. However a small price to pay for this sound!
B0001UL7RY|2|The only song I really thought was worth listening to on this cd, was the smash hit from the radio &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;. Otherwise I thought it was a waste of $12. Definetly not as good as the first cd, I was very disappointed as I am a big Avril fan! Goes to prove the first ones are always the best!!
B00U65KQMQ|5|VLC is everywhere and it works.
B0084I2PEO|5|Very good book. I listen to it via Axis 360. So I didn't actually read it with my eyes. But very much enjoyed the book read to me. Well written with excellent story.
B0011AQLZQ|5|I've read all the books and the movies don't disappoint. Loved it!
B00CH87HF4|5|Good game but some parts I do not like  but I have to give it props so yeah swag swag
B006LSZECO|5|Not just a good yarn.  Even while I followed this slightly incredible story, and wanted to know how it would turn out, I was slotting the commentary in place in my mind.  What kind of parents produce what.  Where do those marital expectations come from (this book is more about marital expectations than it is about anything else - the author is so good at that, it will creep you out).  You can tell, from the moment things go onto television, that commentary is the real subject.<br /><br />But she is so good at it you could go the whole book and just think an author was giving you bits of surface observation.  And in a way that is also what the book is about.  Authors have time to plot, and plan, and hide little surprises (but they have to please you, don't they?).  And the good ones hide stuff for you to really think about.  Or put it right out there in plain sight, but not as \\"commentary\\" but just as canny observation.<br /><br />So, needless to say, saying much about the plot will spoil the suspense.  Two New York writers have fallen in love, but then they lost their jobs and fell out of love.  Things are not going well when Amy, the wife, just disappears one day.  You will spend a lot of time following this like a whodunit, watching the clues assemble, but when the revelations come, you will neither feel vindicated nor cheated.  We are playing a different game here.<br /><br />Just one last observation on observation - she is very good on the subject of feminism.  I found myself nodding at some of her observations, even when they didn't agree with me.  There is a reversal of stereotypes in the middle of the main conceit, and, while it is an old story used by many (mostly female) authors, it is still fresh in the hands of Gillian Flynn, who is so hip and so humanly aware that she brings it home to you.  You get what she is saying about feminism even if you don't realize you got it.<br /><br />So, who would like this book?  Fans of noir, I think, and fans of Big Ideas, and it is very good as a suspense novel.  Who should read it?  Anyone born after 1950 in America, I would say.  This is a book that matters.as, and it is very good as a suspense novel.  Who should read it?  Anyone born after 1950 in America, I would say.  This is a book that matters.
1582403589|5|First, don't let this book make you decide on the rest of the series.  It's supposed to be a long version of Romero's Dawn of the Dead.  The zombies and the rules are the same, but the story takes its own twists and turns.  This story takes a look at the human aspect of a zombie outbreak and how the people deal with the situations that arise.  It's a great case study of human relationships under the strain of constant tragedy.  My friends that have borrowed this or gotten it themselves, have become addicted to it.  It's a great series.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book made me laugh so much - which is a first!!! Yes, it turns out to be quite sad in the end, but I still consider it to be primarily a funny book. It was also particularly nice for me that part of it was set in Amsterdam - one of my favorite cities in the world!! The one flaw for me was that I wish it'd been longer! I really wanted to get more details on how Hazel and Augustus fall in love. They are wonderful characters, so any extra time spent with them would have been great. But truly a very beautiful book, which I'm sure I'll read again many, many times.
B009HQ9UHC|5|8 year old son LOVES this game. Can create contraptions for the piggies to ride in/on. Very creative!
B003ZSJ212|5|Picture and sound is so amazing.  For any hard core Star Wars fan!!!<br />Many deleted clips you have never seen before...
B004SJ3BCI|5|I love angry birds! I enjoy getting rid of the green pigs and helping out the birds. I like using all of the birds and using their special abilities. this app is the best!
B000007XUQ|5|What's not to love about this album ?
B00KLF5J64|5|Awesome soundtrack!!!! The movie was fine but this soundtrack kicks ass!!!!!
B003M70O5O|5|Great
B00BUVPIRS|1|I bought it for my Kindle HDX 7\\". $6.99 at the time.<br />A new game looks great up until your character can run forward. Then it rotates the game upside down.<br />Locking or unlocking the auto rotate screen setting has no effect on stopping it from being unplayable.<br /><br />Rotating the Kindle just causes the game to flip upside down to you again.<br /><br />I deleted the game and then re-downloaded it. Same error making the game unplayable.<br />Waste of money in my case.
B000JMKTLO|2|From very early on, it was clear either mommy dearest or the little psycho did it. Main chick drank way too much. She would not have actually been conscious for most of that book had she really drank that much.
B00DR0PDNE|4|It works very well.  I had some issues after some automatic software updates.  Sometimes, the device lost the tv resolution information and the image appears out of proportions.  The workaround: Unplug the chromecast device from the hdmi port and plug it again.
0985557834|5|Just like vol 1 this is an absolute must read for anyone interested in para cord tying!<br /><br />It is very easy to understand unlike many other books out there.<br /><br />This book is very well done!
B000W00Y0Y|5|This concert is excellent.  Clear picture.  Amazing sound.  A true Queen masterpiece to watch over and over again. It is like you are transported back to the 1981 concert in the front row watching Freddie give yet another stellar performance.
B0086900TI|1|I'm not sure what is the goal here. Social comment? Moralistic tale? The intentions seem noble but at the end of the day, this is a movie. And as a movie, it is not very good. If it was made as a documentary, with real people and real situations, then maybe the message would be clearer. But since it's not a documentary, I judge it as a film. Now take away all the camera effects, the voice over, all the freestyle editing and all the flashbacks and flash forwards, and you've got yourself about 30 minutes or so of real narrative story line. A depressed teacher with a dying father decides to help a young prostitute so that he can feel better about his miserable life. There was enough to make a genuine good film. But it wouldn't have been very original for it's been done several times before. One thing's for sure:  dressing the movie up with so much artificial artifacts isn't what will make it stand out on its own.  I almost took the DVD out after 20 minutes or so. Not only was it pretty depressing but also, it looked like the director was a young filmmaker, still studying in film school, and trying to impress everyone with all sort of technical devices. You're supposed to lose yourself in the story, not admire the director's craft. The actors are pretty convincing but I didn't really care for any of them. It's frustrating cause I wanted to. Everything was there. But the expertise of a director is to make us think that the poetry of a scene is happening on its own, not to force it on us by using all the tricks you've read in the film school manuals. D minus.
B0091REZMW|3|this game is fun but is quite repatative. the items floating all over the screen are a bit distracting at times.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|This game definitely did not disappoint in the least! It has been fun since the first race and the game play is better than the last one! I am very happy with the game
B000MRAAJM|5|This nature series from the BBC is simply the most magnificent photography that I have ever seen. If you have recently upgraded your TV or your DVD player to blue-ray - This is the DVD set you want to fully appreciate your new purchase. And be sure to watch the \\"diaries\\" after you watch the movie; This is where you can see the lengths the photographers went to in order to obtain the footage they created. And I had thought it would be a fantastic job to be an nature photographer! Root canals would be preferable to what some of them went through.  There are a few scenes that are hard to watch-a lion pride taking down an elephant was particularly brutal. I'm not sure I'd want a young child watching it. But Nature being what it is; this was no fault of the BBC. They just happened to have the cameras there.  If you are reading this-I can assume you watch the Discovery channel, and National Geographic, and nature shows on PBS. In my opinion this is better than any program I've seen before.  I have two very inexpensive DVD players-standard and Blue-Ray. I also have both versions of Planet Earth, so i sycn'd them up and watched both using the HDMI on the remote and WOW! This is the DVD that you can look at your wife and say \\"See this is why we needed Blue-Ray\\".

B00005MAM2|5|I saw akira not too long ago. I thought that it is one of the greatest anime's i have ever seen. I suggest all of you that like anime that you have to think about. Not just straight up where someone gets killed and that's it. You actually have to think about the ending. Yes, there's a twist. And, kind of like a really good episode of the Twilight Zone. A MUST SEE!!!!

B00AGE20ZI|4|Nice to see the &#34;old folks&#34; when they were young.  Entertaining movie.  Black & white always make movies seem more serious.
