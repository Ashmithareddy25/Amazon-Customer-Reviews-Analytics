B007IXWL2C|5.0|Like no other series I have ever read.......though not having ever read such provocative material before......I found myself unable to put the books down, purchasing one after the other.  I devoured the three books in \\"three days\\" ..........I look forward to some much needed sleep now.....but I am sure I will be dreaming about .\\"Fifty Shades of........hmmmm.........
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|I wanted to see this film in theaters, but it did not play there for long.  As it turns out, I am glad I saw this at home with subtitles on for the future island scenes. Completely loved how it presented issues about human condition. This film demands your full attention, your thoughts, and an open mind. Time well spent.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is an addictive show.  I am waiting with barely contained enthusiasm for the next season.  Have watched every episode of every season at least twice.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I thought it was well done.  Probably not realistic, but well done for what it is.  Loved the very economical martial arts moves.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|I had to rate it as hating it because I couldn't figure out how to play it.  It was chosen by accident in the first place.
B0031KE9C6|5.0|Veronica Mars is her worthy successor  - no supernatural elements here, just everyday evil. The show opens with Veronica and her ex-sheriff father as local outcasts after he (according to some) bungles the investigation into Veronica's best friend's murder.<br />When her dad becomes a private investigator, Veronica follows suit becoming a teen PI. She battlesthe forces of evil in her small California town with her smarts and cheerleader-esque good looks. There are plenty of dark, noir-ish elements in the storyline but Veronica uses her cutting wit to get her past the derision of her very rich ex-friends and classmates. The writing and acting are good enough to elevate above your oft-aired teen drama - it become a critical favorite and a cult classic for a reason.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|This is not the kind of John Grisham book I am used to reading. In my opinion, it is not up to the standard of stories like<br />A Painted House or The Confession. Also Ford Country Stories which is different than his usual, but hilarious.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|everytime I open it a thing pops up that's says &quot;facebook is not responding force close&quot; can anybody help me
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was good but you have to rate it to get more levels other then that its cool and its fun for all ages
B00APYKXFS|4.0|The developer included quite detailed and helpful instructions, explanations and game hints on the Amazon product page.  Just like the 1980's, however, you don't get an in-game tutorial.  The problem with the lack an in-app tutorial is that the instructions are not portable along with the device.  I have to open a web browser separately from my Kindle to be able to read up on how to play the game.  And I'm not always right next to my web browser or within range of a wireless network.  I'm not sure why the developer chose not to add the instructions to the app (saving space?), but I miss them.  Once you know how the game works, you don't need the instructions to be accessible all of the time, right?  Wrong.  You don't need the instructions until you need them to learn a new skill or technique, or to understand why the game is acting the way it is.  And they need to be available when you need them, which is NOW.<br /><br />I discovered (through trial and error) that you can use the 60-second mode to learn how to work the controls and the game settings.  That way your spaceship will crash and reset quickly, and you can just keep experimenting until you figure out where to set the controls and how the options work.<br /><br />The game is an homage to \\"Galaxy\\" but the developer couldn't seem to decide what decade the game should belong to (the 1980's or the 2010's).  The graphics are superior to those of the 1980's because the pixels were clearly visible, and things didn't look 3-D back then.  The controls are far superior to a 1980's-style joystick because they are smoother and much more responsive to the end user than an old-fashioned joystick (once you figure them out).<br /><br />Even though there is an option to adjust the speed on the menu, the player, essentially, gets only one speed:  WARP.  The player controls the action by deciding where to place the spaceship on the screen.  You can move the device around with your fingers.  It would be nice to slow down more to learn how to play the game.<br /><br />The game music, which is extremely fast-paced to match the tempo of the action, quickly became annoying.  Luckily, one of the screens allows you to turn down the volume.  You can also change the music, but it took me a minute to realize that \\"BGM\\" means background music.<br /><br />One thing I miss is the ability to control when I shoot.  Your spaceship fires constantly at enemies and asteroids alike.  A precision firing option might have been nice.<br /><br />I didn't like this game at first, but decided to give it a chance, and it quickly grew on me.  It is challenging, and it will take some time to develop my skills. All things considered, however, this is a fun choice for a free app of the day.to learn how to play the game.<br /><br />The game music, which is extremely fast-paced to match the tempo of the action, quickly became annoying.

B00AR83PN4|1.0|It is not very often I rate an app only 1 star, because I can almost always find at least one redeeming quality worth noting.  But this app deserves it because it is awful and frustrating.  It earns the \\"I hate it\\" rating because I don't want it, even though it is free today.  And I'm mad that I wasted my time on it.<br /><br />I downloaded it before I went to work this morning, and couldn't make heads or tails out of the instructions.  I gave it up after about 10 minutes because it is a work day for me.<br /><br />On the bus on the way home this evening, I launched the game, determined to figure it out.  I focused a lot of effort trying to learn how to play, but could only ever get the swap button to work every time I tried to activate it (to flip the block over).  The platform could be rotated, but the movement didn't seem to make sense.  Try as I might to direct my blocks to the place I wanted them, they ended up in another slot.  Or worse, they ended up in half of one slot and half of another.  And the little lines that would sometimes appear didn't seem to be meaningful for helping you understand exactly where the blocks were going to be placed.<br /><br />And the colors!  I finally managed to line up three yellow cubes (or so I thought), and they didn't disappear.  When it happened a second time, I looked at them more closely.  The blocks were extremely similar in color, but not exactly the same. Note: You can see the (lack of a) difference in the photo on the web page, but it's easier to see the difference on my web page than on my Kindle.  The cube in the corner at the front of the drawing is dark yellow.  The cubes three squares to the left and three squares to the right of the cube in the front are both light yellow.  Okay.  I admit that there is a slight difference.  Remember, though, that you're trying to see this slight difference when you have very little time to react!<br /><br />I wasted my entire commute this afternoon trying to figure out how to make the controls on this game work.  I could have been reading a good book!  This app is so bad that it earns a virtual raspberry! :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :Pke the controls on this game work.

B00B4Z5J92|5.0|A lot of \\"older\\" folks say that my generation missed out on great music. This documentary drives home their point. If you like to listen to music, this may not be for you. If you love music and if music moves you in ways that nothing else will, this is for you.<br />Watch it. Spread the word and listen to independent music. I suggest you start with Joseph Huber!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I really enjoy the music by this group. I find it easy to relax with and so pleasant to watch them on TV. They have such interesting performances.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Having been impressed with Margaret for years, watching Streep as her, was like watching the real thing. orh watching more than once.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I am a big Q. Tarantino fan, so this is a biased review as I honestly have not seen a movie he has made that is bad! I love his work! Django Unchained is a different kind of QT film in that it tackled slavery in the U.S., racism, and even a true love story.  Great screenplay acted out by great actors - AWESOME movie!!!!
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|Great movie to watch and cast is top notch especially  in blu ray. Andrew Lloyd webber has done it again
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are so interesting. Their music is wonderful to sit and listen to or read to. I find myself playing their CD's more often than I thought that I would.
B00005KAQP|5.0|I bought this DVD when it first came out, so much so that I have to make oa gift to a dear friend who missed seeing it ever. In face I have given this DVD as a gift more than once. Just Great!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Really good read. I couldn't put it down. Really thought out story. I will recommend it to friends. 5 stars from me.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|One of the best movies of all time.  All of the cast gave great performances & it deserved all the Oscars it received.
B00005JMCN|5.0|This was purchased to be given as a gift.  It will make for good family viewing, along with a canister of popcorn !
B008TT7CXW|4.0|I have accumulated a few cards with either pictures or music and had them scattered about. Now everything is in one convenient place. It's also easy to carry around. It's the perfect size.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is top notch. Great acting, story lines and look and feel of the show is excellent.. Many friends and aquaintances love Downton Abbey. Keep playing the free seasons Amazon!! Love this series.
B005PK57IK|5.0|It is my favorite show on tv.  The writing is superb, the  acting, equally so.  Why this show has not received more awards is confusing to me.  Homeland is good, but not as consistently good as The Good Wife, which is very often brilliant.. Homeland is controversial, more nudity, so I guess that is awards are about.  Julianna is far superior to Clair Danes, in my opinion, it is so easy to play crazy!  To play normal is a challenge.<br /><br />The cast does an excellent job, sometimes, I love them, then I'm mad at them, sometimes I loathe them, then somehow I love them again.  They never cease to amaze me with their storylines, and how they interweave characters from previous seasons.  Love it.
076781326X|5.0|This is undeniably the best representation of Oliver, as the acting is superb, and the music is memorable.  This is definitely one of the classics.
0399159347|4.0|This is a very difficult review to write due to the fact just about anything that is said regarding the plot will divulge the secret and destroy the enjoyment of the future reader. The only thing I will share is that the title pretty much says it all --- the husband's secret impacts every person in this novel in a fundamental way and we watch as the secret's ramifications ripple from the moment it is revealed.<br /><br />What I will share about the book is that I truly enjoyed it from beginning to end. Being my first exposure to this writer, I wasn't sure what to expect but found myself very pleasantly surprised. The novel is interesting for all kinds of reasons including the fact it is set in Australia. The seasons being reversed from what they are hear kept me a bit \\"off\\" which helped to keep me a bit unsettled, playing nicely into the tone of the book. The book actually reminded be quite a bit of Maeve Binchy, which is high praise coming from me since she is one of my favorite writers. The way the three main stories interweave and the way the onion is peeled slowing leading the reader into the very heart of the characters is vintage Binchy. Not at all fluffy, silly, summer reading but yet light enough to be very enjoyable.<br /><br />Bottom line: A very enjoyable read with interesting characters and interesting situations. I liked it enough to go look for other novels by this same author.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|I loved this song from the first time I heard it, and now I know why. It reminded my of the greatest songs of the Disco era. Well, it turns out that Niles Rodgers (Founder of Chic and composer of all their hits), is playing the guitar in this track.<br />Check it out here! [...]
B0014JKJHK|1.0|I have no idea what's going on with these crocs.  They really seem to be hit or miss.  My wife and I both work in the restaurants.  we  have both happily owned crocs bisto clogs, and got many miles out of them.  That being said I have had to return 3 pairs of these shoes out of the last 4 that I bought for us.  they claim to be &#34;non-slip&#34; but i'll tell you that wearing tennis shoes is safer then wearing these.  I don't understand because I have owned 3 pairs of these.. 2 of them are very good, but one of them was terrible.  My wife has had one pair for 3 years... after they finally died I tried unsuccessfully to order her 3 separate pairs of the same shoe.  they all had the same problem.. completely unsafe, and definitely not non-slip.  I finally gave up and ordered her SHOES FOR CREWS FROGZ, which work great. I know what non-slip shoes should look like.  these are not the crocs that you wear in the outside world.  these are kitchen shoes with non-skid soles, that don't work.  I don't understand because I have had crocs bistos that were great,  whats going on with crocs?? ANYONE ELSE HAVE THIS ISSUE?????????
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's challenging. I like how each level makes me really think about my next move. Ever since I downloaded the app I can't stop playing.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|What all is there to say that hasn't been said? Tim Ferriss brings passion, sincerity and wit to subjects that most people find taxing. Work, dieting and now cooking are all covered by this guy who loves to learn and had the right friends and mindset to do so quickly. A very enjoyable read.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|Just wish it was a one time cost for the productive pack I can slightly understand monthly for the other but still the producktive would be nice to have forever:(
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Enough said!  If you like movies about success against some odds, this one is a good one.  Also well acted.
B00CAJMGDI|4.0|A different view of the classical violin.  This girl can turn a 4 string violin into a heavy metal guitar almost.  Fun to listen to for sure.  Enjoy this one.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Long time fan. Looooong Time. Not a comparison to any other recent releases. Just great music. I love this. Just great music.
B005OHSD3A|5.0|This book definitely helped me to create a new self image! I would read a thousand more of these! How do I say thanks?<br />My health and life has been returned to me!
044024613X|4.0|William Landay found just the right balance between dramatic tension and comic relief in this story dealing with the issue of criminal propensities and one family's inexorable slide into destruction. His use of courtroom transcripts as a way of moving the narrative is a clever device that allows the reader to become a spectator in the courtroom, and also brings greater insight regarding the simmering enmity between the assistant DA and the father of the accused, who is also the narrator. Landay is able to bring the reader into the daily struggle endured by the parents such in a way that evokes sympathy one moment and exasperation the next.  He has concocted a complicated web of family relationships that will appeal to almost any reader regardless of their preferred genre.
1419818112|5.0|I truly loved absolutely eveyrhing about this movie-from the exqusite glass house to the character roles,along with the actors who portrayed them.  Go Alejandro!!!
B00782O7NE|5.0|The Artist is a film that's true to excellent cinematic storytelling.  No CGI, just great directing and acting that tells the story of a silent film actor caught in the cataclysmic time when talkies left many actors unemployed, and the Great Depression robbed them of their wealth.  As George is spiraling downward, he crosses paths with a young actress who is on her way up in talkies.<br /><br />There are great, iconic scenes that will forever be remembered in cinema history.  Don't miss this one and buy it for your collection; you will fall in love with it and watched it multiple times.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Stunning visuals....super high quality eye candy shots...powerful imagery....<br /><br />There is one really weird and somewhat disturbing scene where a guy is rubbing mud all over his face and making funny faces/sounds.  Would probably ask the kids to walk out of the room during this scene but the rest of the movie is fine.
0812550706|5.0|I loved Ender's Game. It combines an intriguing look into the future with a suspenseful and rich rendering of a boys life in that new world. Ender's character and that of his siblings has depth and complexity. It is a story of violence, guilt and love. Ender's Game is a classic for all time.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was a great conclusion to the series.  I enjoyed reading every word and learning more about these bittersweet characters.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|It would have been nice to have an in-game guide for when I got stuck ,  but over all not to hard to figure out the puzzles.<br />I will very impatient for the sequel..
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this gAme so much, totally worth the money<br /><br />I memorized this whole entire gAme, that's how great this gAme is.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next chapter!
B005NJU8PA|3.0|It's a crazy book for crazy cooks, some bad language usage.  But gives you good tips for cooking in general
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was a &#34;happy ending&#34; conclusion to a long and drawn out story.  Not the best written, not the best characters, but way to bring light to a genre right when digital reading is catching on..Way to be smart in your marketing
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|Bodies (Staged Fright#1) by Sameer Ketkar is an excellent book.  It caught my attention and would simply not let me put it down.  I ended up staying up until 3AM to finish it.  Not many books these days do that.<br />It is written in first person and the narrator is a young boy who is still in Middle School.  He is from a family of geniuses and attends a school for Advanced and Gifted students although he is just normal.  His is a very diverse family.  His parents both work for the CDC in Atlanta, his sister is especially gifted in science, and his brother began writing music at the age of four.  Neil (Cornelius) finds he is always a second or two behind others in explaining things and feels he always is failing, even though his parents try to help him with that misconception. However, not fitting in is a general feeling for middle school students.  Because of their jobs, their parents are not always there for the kids.  Rachel sells marijuana just for the fun of it and Jack a Lothario with the girls at school.  The murder of Rachel's chemistry teacher by way of a new and nasty chemical bioweapon brings the investigation from a downtown hotel to the kids' prestigious school. An elusive clue feeds the rumor that the chemistry teacher had an affair with one of his students.  As the plot thickens, Neil works his way through the murky waters to the truth.  Now he just has to get someone to listen to him.<br />The erotic scenes and sexy overtones just add to the confusion of the mystery and actually keep it relatively light.  The twists and turns of the characters as they grow through the book are as entertaining as finding out who killed Mr. Poncetti.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|Overall movie is a good teen movie. It does have some low spots though, but my kids loved it. True buy.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|The game is fun but constantly asks you to purchase more items to continue.  It should have more times to get the rescue animals.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I have to say, I wish there was a little more depth to the characters and that you felt like you had a more personal connection to them.  With that out of the way, what a genuinely unique and interesting concept.  it's like a bastardized version of the Olympics, isn't it?
B00C391Y3I|5.0|This Bluray is everything I expected! I have a Bluray Home Thearter and it was worth every penny!! Sound is just amazing and high quality! Video quality is extremely amazing!<br /><br />10/10
B0086700CM|5.0|I recommend this app because it is challenging to your brain. It keeps you thinking and works hand eye coordination.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I really hated to lose google reader, and its taken some getting used to but feedly is good alternative. I'm guessing I'll like it more as I use it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I very much enjoyed submerging myself in this series. The relationships are built well and you truly find yourself caring for these characters and hoping for the best! I'm excited to see how the pages are translated via film, 8/2013.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Great attention to detail throughout the movie.  Authentic recreation of the Russian culture and great representation of the language barrier.  I can watch this movie 1000 times and figure out something new each time.
B001AQO446|5.0|What can I say? It's The Blues Brothers!! What it lacked in the laws of physics (being a comedy), they filled with celebrity appearances. You WILL recognize a lot of faces from today's television shows and movies. You just might walk away from this movie with a better appreciation of the blues in all of its forms.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|enjoy the mindlessness of this game.  lots of gratification in the rewards.  love the levels.  can play for hours or a few minutes.  always relaxing go play.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|I'm not one to watch many things more than once especially television shows (hate when they do reruns) but this show has such good dialogue I can't help it. I ended up watching every episode from the pilot through season 2 in one week and I could see some episodes again. Can't wait for season 3.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This album is amazing - Classic west coast hip hop.  This was when snoop was still on his game.  The dogg pound is nice too!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This product has saved me time, eye strain, and money! This app has made it so I can see the amount of power when it is charged and charging so I don't have to dig for it, and it was all free!!!!! I do reacommend this app for any travelrs or cubicle dwellers.
B000S58428|4.0|1.  Politik - musings<br /><br />2.  In my place - Melodic song about being in love<br /><br />3.  God put a smile Upon Your Face - A guy tries to hook up with a girl.<br /><br />4.  The Scientist - The guy wants his girl back.  Slightly sad.  A great song!<br /><br />5.  Clocks - fast paced electronic high energy song!  My favorite!<br /><br />6. Daylight - song about daylight<br /><br />7. Green Eyes - a man talks about the love of his life<br /><br />8.  Warning Sign - a guy talks about missing his girl<br /><br />9.  A Whisper - song about whispers<br /><br />10. A Rush of Blood to the Head - Title song.  A man wishes that he could get revenge<br />for his girl on the man that did her wrong.<br /><br />11. Amsterdam<br /><br />These are some of my thoughts listening to the lyrics.  This is a great album.

B005FITIIC|5.0|I am a finance guy so any wall street like movie I am into.  This movie is actually very well produced and directed.  It did not get much press or marketing but this is better than Wall Street 2!
B00AZ6RSFE|5.0|One of the best film I've seen in a long time.  I haven't bought a DVD in a couple years, but I really wanted this one so my girlfriend and her kids could watch.  I don't want to over sell it, but this is a great family movie with a lot of like lessons and some cool surfing, but not too much..
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I haven't read any Collen Hoover books until this one and I am so glad I found it. The story line is fantastic and the characters were very intriguing. This book mixed with all of my emotions; I cried, I laughed, I smiled, I got mad, and I even got butterflies in a lot of parts. I love this book and I will recommend it to everyone!! :)
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Priceless movie.. If you don't know about this movie, then you've been living under a rock for a couple of years.. Top 5 in Gangster Movie List
B0000039QA|5.0|Classic, great double album!! It has some great tracks and a lot of music.  This is a must-have for the hip hop collection!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Kanye West's Yeezus is hands down the most artistically driven album by any rapper in the last 3 years. The whole album is dope!!!! Super high quality, way better than Lil Wayne's averageness.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I have been putting off watching this show. Finally set to it and really enjoyed it. I am not as impressed with the lead character as I am with the supporting cast. It's a great show.
B0019EXZYE|4.0|Great hit for Jason Statham, he does a great acting job like always.. This Movie is a must have for your collection
1451624468|5.0|Amazing book. Not even halfway in and I'm already astonished. Lawrence Krauss is a great physicist and an even better author.
1451629192|4.0|Amazing that she came out on the other side with her sanity.  An honestly straight-forward retelling of her terrible kidnapping.
1442444053|5.0|I just finished listening to the unabridged audio book version and absolutely loved it! The narrator did a great job.<br />There was an introduction by the author in which he explained the genesis of the story, so I didn't bother looking for deeper meaning as I listened as I suspect some will. This was a story he told his kids who then encouraged him to write it down as it was very compelling.<br /><br />As it was, I liked the style, the rabbits, the whole story. Who would have thought a story about rabbits would be so attractive? But there you have it, at 47, I had a grand time listening.<br /><br />\\"Laping\\" has to come from the French word \\"lapin\\" (rabbit). Also, fracas (I didn't see it spelled) is another French word meaning loud noise. Just in case you were wondering...<br /><br />Anyway, after such a nice experience, I feel I should turn my attention to \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" and hope it will be as good as \\"Watership Down\\".
B001EIOOV8|5.0|This Movie is one of the best of all time.. Gives you a glimpse of how the Vegas life was & how the industry has changed from it..
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a great flashlight!! It displays any color  that you could need! It is the WHOLE screen which is so much better than my phone flashlight. I always have my Kindle Fire and now I have light!!  :D
B004W25KKW|3.0|I had fun reading this book. It was an easy read. The background info he proves are great. But it doesnot help you with any techniques per say. All it says is that you have to use a memory palace to remember things. It does not tell you concretely how to remember e.g. A deck of cards. It just tell you to associate an image with each card. I recommend the book because it shows more than anything that with focus and training, you can do amazing things.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Why the Vice President made the decision for the missile strike that killed the children? Was the President on vacation? Guess i have to watch it again as this detail does not conform with reality.  Hey, I almost forgot..great show!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Great footage and sounds excellent on surround sound.  My generation never got to see the real thing but this would be next best.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|the game itself was gun and challenging it really does make u think but there isn't really any levels there's only about 10. overall I liked it but I would add more levels.
B00BJNHACS|5.0|Sort of like Off Road but throw in more precise timing. Pretty addicting since I often finish a run and immediately play it again thinking I could do a little better next time. Music and speed add to the rush. Could use better tutorial for tips.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|even though i've seen 4 times, this is a keeper--  just for fun of US American) in Paris and time shift. Good telling of era.
B00DM0UTPQ|3.0|A bit slow moving at the start, but more action toward the end.  Was good for a relaxing evening, but probably would not feel a need to ever watch again.

1594484805|5.0|The psychology of motivation is still an understudied and often misunderstood area of business. Many reviews of this book note that the information is not well annotated, that the writer presents the material in a biased manner to prove his point, and that there is a good amount of fluff in the information presented.  To the last two points, I would agree - but that does not detract from the book or the easy flowing nature of the read.  To the comments that the book is poorly researched or lacks supporting annotation, there are 8 pages of footnotes in microscopic type, and a whole section in the \\"toolkit\\" where 15 books are explicitly added to the reader's reading list, and another 10-15 are noted elsewhere in the book.  You may not agree with the message, but Daniel Pink is not the only messenger.<br /><br />The material resonates with this reader - a chief executive with more than 20 years of management experience.  People are beyond base plus bonus.  The need to have purpose in life and work seems to be a more compelling driver than ever before.  Pink notes that the three elements that appear to motivate people to achieve are:<br /><br />*Autonomy<br />*Mastery<br />*Purpose<br /><br />If the work environment can provide a maximum opportunity for all three elements, there's a fighting chance that the employee will be successful, motivated, happy, productive and the clients will be well-served.  His focus on the Results Only Work Environment (ROWE) mirrors the direction that leading edge companies - especially technology companies - have been taking for years.  The innate psychology resonates with this reader for himself as well. It isn't all about the money, but it is all about the achievement or mastery of a craft in which money is a measurement of mastery but not proof of it.<br /><br />Any manager, teacher or parent should pick this book up and read the profound wisdom contained in its pages.  How to think about tasks, work, the structure or organizations and management are all in there, and they are all useful in the development of your own managerial tool box.management are all in there, and they are all useful in the development of your own managerial tool box.

I use this daily as it not only tells you with a very attractive graphic how much you have left in your battery by percentage, it shows how much actual time you have left if you listen to music, read, or surf the web, watch movies, etc. It has several screens of great info that you will find you can't live without. I wish I had a way to have this on my non-android phone! SO, in other words,GET IT NOW!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This brilliant book captures both the difficult lives of people living in Afghanistan and the lives of Afghan immigrants assimilating into western culture. Mr. Hosseini paints a brilliant portrait of how family and cultural traditions of the past come into conflict with individuals who have left Afghanistan and in the process begin their own cycles of self actualization. A wonderful book.
B00ABO573A|2.0|I found it hard to really engage with the characters or understand why (or how) they managed to last so long together in their dysfunction.  Save your money.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Spoiler alert: If you haven't watched it already, I might spoil some of it for you with what I'm about to say.<br /><br />I could barely get through the first half hour, and I did so griping and swearing because it seemed so bad, and I had just spent $5 renting the HD version. I thought about walking out of the theater, marching up to the ticket counter, and demanding my money back, only the theater was my living room, and I couldn't bring myself to write Amazon such an email. I went to bed picking apart what I had seen and finding all the problems with bad acting, terrible dialogue, and weak story.<br /><br />The next day, I forced myself to sit down and finish it for no other reason than the money I had spent. I sat there with my arms crossed and a pouty look on my face thinking the next hour and a half would be torture, but before I knew it, I was laughing, and I even ended up shedding a few tears. I should add to this that it was the 4th of July, and I am relatively patriotic, and this movie has a patriotic theme with the land of Oz fighting for independence from the rule of the witches. And it is entirely possible that I might have been slightly intoxicated (I'm going to watch it again soberly today to see if I have the same feelings :-)<br /><br />I like Zach Braff, but I think of him as a television guy, and while I enjoyed Garden State, I don't think he has learned how to think like a movie actor yet. It was partly his lines in the first thirty minutes of this movie that made me hate the movie so much. The dialogue just seemed so badly written. But it was Braff who rescued the movie for me when I started watching on the second day, and his character of Finley the monkey got me to laugh. Then the China Girl entered, probably my favorite character in the movie. What really saved the story for me was Glinda, and this is what gets to the heart of my problem with the story.<br /><br />I guess Oz is supposed to be a shady guy with a good heart at his core, and mylife has taught me more and more not to trust shady guys, even when I believe they are good at their core. Knowing they are good deep down does not redeem them for me, and as long as they keep lying, tricking, manipulating, and pranking, I do not want them anywhere near me, and I will respond with anger if they try to trick me. But then, I was raised by a US Marine who had absolutely no patience for BS. My sister idolized Judy Garland, and has a collection of Wizard of Oz memorabilia, so I am pretty familiar with that movie, and I know that Oz is revealed to be somewhat of a s****** in the end, and that is apparently where the character is supposed to find its core of meaning and arc. So as I'm watching them delve further into Oz's character, I'm waiting for it to redeem itself, and in the end, he doesn't end up revealing greatness, just goodness, but what I wanted was greatness, at least if he is to become king (err, rather, wizard). If he is at best just a good guy, then fine, he should take the role of a secondary character, but if he is to become king, he's going to have to impress me on a whole nuther level beyond magic tricks. Can you imagine if Aragorn from the Lord of the Rings ascended to the throne of Middle Earth by means of double talk and slight of hand?<br /><br />My other problem again centers around the character of Oz, or rather, the person they chose to play him. I guess I just do not like James Franco, or I have yet to see him play a role that I like. I kept hoping they would just focus the camera on one of the beautiful actresses and leave him out of the shot because his appearance just rubs me the wrong way. They apparently asked Robert Downey Jr. to play the role, and I wonder if I would have liked it more with him, but I suspect the weak character would prevent me from enjoying it played by any actor.<br /><br />When Glinda entered the story, I breathed a sigh of relief that we had finally found a strong character. I read the following quote from producer Joe Roth on Wikipedia:<br /><br />\\"...during the years that I spent running Walt Disney Studios -- I learned about how hard it was to find a fairy tale with a good strong male protagonist. You've got your Sleeping Beauties, your Cinderellas and your Alices. But a fairy tale with a male protagonist is very hard to come by. But with the origin story of the Wizard of Oz, here was a fairy tale story with a natural male protagonist. Which is why I knew that this was an idea for a movie that was genuinely worth pursuing.\\"<br /><br />Does he really think Oz is a strong male protagonist? A strong man walks around lying, cheating, and tricking people? A strong man becomes king only through dumb luck, and despite his own cowardice? There are two strong characters in this entire story, and they are Glinda and the China Girl. The China Girl proves herself to be a bad ass in spite of how fragile she is. Glinda amazes me with her patience with Oz, and the ability to bring out the best in him, however pathetic his best is. That she believes in him causes me to wonder if I should be more patient with and forgiving of the s****** in my life, and that is where the story redeems itself for me.<br /><br />I'm giving it five stars because of Glinda, the China Girl, the visuals, and the character of Theadora - while I couldn't be more bummed that they made Mila Kunis so ugly, I can't keep from hoping that she will some day find her goodness and beauty again, even though I know full well how her story ends. I was worried about Mila early on in the story because her dialogue seemed to bad, but I thought she did well with the role once she turned green. And I got over my gripes about terrible dialogue when I realized it was probably necessary for this type of fairy tale, although I can't help but wonder if it could have been just slightly better written.<br /><br />One last thing, I don't appreciate Sam Raimi making me jump out of my skin with all of his sudden scares. I am a sensitive person, and tend to be high strung, and I have never been a fan of horror movies, although I did think Army of Darkness was pretty cool. He lulls you into a sense of peace and quiet and then surprises you by suddenly throwing a loud and scary monster in your face, and I just don't appreciate that.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|This book was fairly boring in the middle.  There wasn't much that happened in this book.  It almost seems more like a bridge between the last book and whatever book will be next.  I prefer books to be self contained and instead this author insists on the cliff hanger at the end.  Solves that issue quickly at the beginning of the next book and then spends most of the book setting up the cliff hanger at the end.  Just wants to sell more. Books.  The book by itself is not very good.  The previous two were better.

0345358945|4.0|The authors presented their findings in a very interesting manner and inspired me to try some of their methods. It didn't take too long to have 2 lucid dreams in the same night. The best use of this book inspires the reader and dreamer to learn to be conscious at all times, or at least as much of the time as possible, by using the same techniques whether awake or asleep. I would say this book has helped me become more aware of &#34;reality&#34; when awake than when asleep! Very easy reading, even the technical parts.

I can view the slides and IF I want to keep it I can put it on the memory card and transfer to my computer or go to a photo kiosk and have the photo printed... This works great  and I haven't had any trouble with it so far..... I've only done about 35 slides and haven't tried any negatives yet so that is the only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars.... It's great to have pictures of my grandparents and my mother when she was little since she also has passed on....  I would recommend this to everyone!

B005LAIIQC|3.0|4.5 (PQ/AQ) but 3 for the contents. Sometime, you just can't trust the review or comment but to watch it yourself.<br /><br />The movie is dull and boring where there's not much of a twist. It just can't tense up my nerve cells. So much chasing on the roof and bike. The assassin sent from Thailand to Manila really tried his best to look cool and cold-blooded but I really don't see the essence there. The worst part is that after a few round ( &#62;15mins) chasing, with one simple side kick the assassin bang into a pillar and died, what a joke without even any physical contact/fighting.<br /><br />I guess a good movie from the start will find it's very challenging to have a breakthrough episodes and it's better to stop at 3 episodes the most (Iron1~2~3, Spiderman1~2~3)

B009DH379C|5.0|I have the Live at Wembley Stadium DVD which I enjoy very much and I play it more than any other concert Blu-ray I have. I remembered I've voiced up how nice there'll be a Blu-ray version.<br /><br />So after a long wait, here comes the Blu-ray version that closely resemble the Live at Wembley Stadium. You must forgive the picture quality a bit as it's transferred from the film in the 80's. Audio quality is good but I think the Wembley Stadium DVD sounded better (weird...I hope someone can testify and explain this finding).<br /><br />I don't understand why the tracks \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\", \\"Hello Mary Lou (Goodbye Heart)\\" have been lifted as compare to the Live at Wembley Stadium DVD. In any case, it's still a best buy and you should be happy to put it in your library. Enjoy!

B008JFUO72|5.0|The third Iron Man movie took Tony Stark out of the costume and let him be the main character. Instead of seeing nothing more than one super powered baddie slugging away at one super powered good guy (the characteristic that made \\"The Man of Steel\\" a yawn-fest) the audience saw a story about a \\"real\\" person backed up by Iron Man. This is the quality Stan Lee used when creating all his characters, and it is the quality that made them so popular.

B008K9SG9K|5.0|It has been a while since I have heard some new music that was actually good, but this album definitely has changed that. Every song gets my approval and thumbs up. Some are particularly catchy and end up getting stuck in my head like Underdog, but not in a way that is annoying. Imagine Dragons has a new fan. Amsterdam has a Coldplay vibe to it, especially at the beginning. The album's leading singles, It's Time and Radioactive are also great. It is rare for me to actually like a song from a new or previously unheard of artist on the radio but those songs are great! Radioactive was the song that really got me hooked on their music. I also really like the message in Demons. Lastly, I'd like to give a shout out to On Top of The World because it is also very catchy and has a very happy vibe to it, almost reminding me of Simba's &#34;I Just Can't Wait to be King&#34; on the Lion King movie. But, in the end, all of the songs, even the ones I didn't mention, are great.
B00B4804KS|2.0|it's a shame that this 3D blu ray we bought for our family is not 3D like we expected. We love the movie and still do but we should have just bought the blu ray.

B000007MVM|4.0|Admit it - I'm a Syd Barrett FANATIC. Anyway, this album is a very personal testament to the artistry of Syd Barrett. Not crazy about every single song on the album, but there's some very strong material, and Syd Barrett's personal presence here is immense. Piper at the Gates of Dawn is a masterpiece, and a major portion of that was composer, lyricist, singer and lead guitarist - Syd. However, with that album you don't get a sense of Syd Barrett as a person, but on The Madcap Laughs you strongly do. So that makes it all the more heartbreaking the downward spiral this man suffered.<br /><br />This is a very iconic album cover - damn I wish I had the vinyl version. Syd famously painted the wooden floor of his Wetherby Mansions flat alternating orange and turquoise in preparation for the photo shoot. Additionally, he cleared out all furniture of his already spartan living conditions. The resulting photograph (by Storm Thorgerson who also designed other Floyd covers) beautifully reflects the descending twilight of a musical genius.<br /><br />Accompanying Mr. Barrett on this album were musicians Robert Wyatt and Jerry Shirley from the Soft Machine (sans Kevin Ayers). Contractual restrictions prevented them from being listed in album notes (which are minimal). Syd plays some nice acoustic and electric as well, and I like the stripped down feel. But what stands out about the re-release of this album: the SIX bonus tracks of alternate takes. Take the inclusion of \\"No Good Trying\\" Take 5 for instance. Not the greatest of Syd's repertoire, but still a charming song with Syd wonderful vocally. But what I love especially is the studio chatter. The song starts and stops. Syd says \\"OK, I'll do it again.\\" Then, you hear an exchange between Syd and the studio engineer who is posing a question. Syd answers \\"No. It's nice, jangly. Keep it there.\\" Then you hear a heavy sigh before he starts anew. Music had become a chore, and yet Barrett continues in a beautifully clear and resonant voice. For further reference, all alternative takes and Syd's full output have long been collected in the extremely thorough bootleg \\"Have You Got It Yet?\\" Quality is very mixed, but there are some serious gems therein. A portion of the collection on vinyl is available right here on Amazon. (But it will cost you major bucks.)<br /><br />So without any doubt, if you want to acquire \\"The Madcap Laughs\\" most definitely reach for this 2010 version.voice.

B003YOZNBK|3.0|This film seems like it would have been much better as a sequel than the original movie. I have a feeling however that the film makers were concerned this was the only shot they had at a Jonah Hex movie (and it probably was) and decided to tell this one instead. The problem is that the backstory is so rushed that there is not much in the way of character development. You get the basic details (Hex was a soldier in the confederate army, who refused to execute an order of his commanding officer, Quentin Turnbull (played by John Malkovich) and in the process kills Turnbull's son (who also happens to be Hex's friend). Hex's family is then killed in front of him, he is branded on the cheek (giving the facial deformity) and left to die. In the process of being healed by the local Indian tribe he gains the power to talk to the dead.<br /><br />That is the story should have been fleshed out in detail. The entire movie clocks in around 80 min, and that story is probably given less than 20. Aside from knowing who the good guy and bad guy are, we have no real reason to be invested in any of the characters. Which is a shame given that the supporting cast is made up of some very good actors (Michel Fassbender, Lance Reddick etc). Megan Fox was pretty much the same as always. Looks pretty and has a couple good one liners, but her character is not in the movie all that much until the end. And again, there is no backstory for her character so the only reason we are supposed to care about her character is she is pretty and loves Jonah Hex.<br /><br />I think the movie would have been better served to have been a little longer, with the first half giving a true backstory of the events that lead up to the start of this movie, then Hex going after Turnbull initially and then his transition to a bounty hunter. If that movie did well, then a better version of this movie could have been made and with characters that people actually are invested in, they may have been able to get at least a couple movies from the story.<br /><br />I have never read the comics, but from reading other reviews it seems like they diverged a lot from the source material. If you are a fan of the comics and changing the story would piss you off, then I would say skip this entirely. For everyone else, the movie is entertaining enough. There are some good action sequences and the A/V quality of the movie is very good on Blu Ray. It could have been better, but with the short running time (especially for comic book movies) it gets in and out pretty quickly.a couple movies from the story.<br /><br />I have never read the comics, but from reading other reviews it seems like they diverged a lot from the source material.

I honestly think regardless of where you stand on that subject, this movie is entertaining and worth watching.<br /><br />Stone definitely believes there was a conspiracy, even while acknowledging in the notes included in the book portion of the director's cut of the film that it is possible there was none. Where he opened himself up to criticism is that he did not pick a theory and go with that. While the movie is centered around the alleged involvement of Clay Shaw, Stone basically threw out all the various possibilities that have been put forth over the years from Cuba to the mob, to the CIA orchestrating the hit. He couches the various theories using words like possibly, maybe etc. He also does a great job weaving in old news and archived footage with scenes that he filmed.  So much so that it was hard to tell at times where the footage ended and the movie started. Stone's stated intention however was to provide all of the theories, and let the viewers make up their own minds. To that end, regardless of whether you believe that was the responsible way to approach the film, it succeeds. Where he did leave himself open to the most valid criticism was where he was just plain inaccurate. The big one that comes to mind is the trial scene recreating the magic bullet when he placed Kennedy and Connely directly in line with each other on the same level. In reality Connely's seat sat lower and off center, which when taken into account omits all the turns that the bullet would have to do in the whole \\"left, then right\\" sequence of the film.<br /><br />The lynchpin of the film's quality, regardless of whether you agree with the substance, was the acting. Many A or B list actors who were alive at the time had a role in the film. Some little more than cameos, but it really was a who's who when it came to the cast. I think Costner did a great job making Jim Garrison much more of a heroic figure than he really was. His overall reputation outside the JFK case was pretty checkered. The film boasts a cast of Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Walter Mathau, John Candy, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon, among many others. There was not one bad performance in the bunch.<br /><br />I am not sure how long the theatrical version of the movie is. If memory serves, it was just under three hours. This clocks in at just under three and a half hours, with a lot of additional and extended scenes. Including a 5 minute or so narrative at the beginning of the movie that describes Kennedy's presidency up to that point. There are also a few features included as extras along with even more deleted scenes. Chances are anyone reading this by now already has a strong opinion of the movie. For those who do not, as I said regardless of your position on whether there was a conspiracy or not, you can still enjoy the acting and the non fictionalized or theorized historical aspects of the movie. If nothing else this will always be a movie that is a conversation starter.

B006QPX6IG|5.0|There are plenty of descriptions of this movie and its plot available, so to avoid repeating all of that, I will say that I was able to briefly visit Gettysburg for a few hours about 150 years from opening scenes of the movie. While the movie may take some liberties with history, it does a good job of adding a human touch to a horrific battle and one of the pivotal events in American history. It was interesting to see the movie after visiting the actual battlefield and be able to connect faces and events with what are monuments today. If you are a civil war buff, you will want to see this movie.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great story about interaction of members of a family facing an extremely difficult  period in their lives and how each person deals with adversity.  Do we believe that genetic tendencies are inherited?  This book brought out some great discussions at our book club.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|The album demonstrates the maturity that she has gone through since her last album. Her growth is spectacular. Love her. Her songs range from being cheesy pop songs with meaning to emotionally drained songs that are accompanied by the sensations of sincerity she portrays through her incredible, wide ranged voice, which add to the impact and connection she has on the listener.<br /><br />She already has a voice great enough voice to grant her the label of a &#34;powerhouse&#34; - I can only wait to hear the greatness that comes from her maturity - personally, lyrically, and vocally - in future years that will leave her set to have her name accompanied by great titles.

Several of the songs will be my favorites for years to come!

B00C3MK9ZO|4.0|Leprous' debut album, \\"Tall Poppy Syndrome,\\" was one of the most amazing (perhaps THE most amazing) full-length debut albums I'd heard at the time. There was something so fresh about their brand of pop-influenced progressive rock. \\"Bilateral\\" followed a couple of years later, which was good, though perhaps not quite as remarkable, and finally we have \\"Coal,\\" their third album. The band hasn't stretched themselves very far when it comes to songwriting, and frankly, I'm okay with that. They really do have a unique sound that I can't get enough of. \\"Coal\\" is an excellent album top to bottom; expect a couple of tracks that sound like Queen might have written them if they'd had a prog rock bent, and a handful of others that would sound quite at home on an Ihsahn album (he makes a haunting guest appearance on the last track). So even if it's a difficult album to find fault with, it could never stand up to the brilliance of their first record. But don't let that be a knock against \\"Coal.\\" Buy it for yourself and discover one of the brightest talents out there in the prog world.

B00BLSJI80|5.0|Demi Lovato's fourth edition to her musical career, DEMI, doesn't reveal any starving-for-light-confessions or any major risks--the upbeat tempo alternates between sweet and sassy. Critics will say that this particular album is more or less a stepping stone Demi is using to figure out what her style as a musical artist is. I am not a big fan of Demi Lovato, but when I heard this album, I immediately fell in love with the songs. The songs are upbeat and uplifting which are so different from the music she typically showcases.

0670026557|5.0|The priceless core lesson of Grant's extraordinary book (my favorite on behavior since Quiet) is that we can become successful and lead a satisfying life with others if we learn the right way to give. This talented, widely-liked and introverted social scientist divides the world into givers, takers and matchers:<br /><br />* The majority of us are givers, according to Grant, yet \\"are overrepresented at both ends of the spectrum of success.\\"<br /><br />* \\"Takers seek to come out ahead in every exchange; they manage up and are defensive about their turf.<br /><br />* Matchers expect some kind of quid pro quo, \\"with a master chit list in mind.\\"<br /><br />What makes some givers successful and sought-after is that they have both a deep, evident caring for others, yet they also attend to their own self-interest. They are not \\"doormats.\\" Grant cites three relevant behaviors for being productive, happy givers:<br /><br />Be judicious about giving to takers<br />Give in ways that reinforce and support your most vital relationships. (You can't serve everyone extremely well and care for yourself) Consolidate your giving into chunks of time with an individual or group so your support has a more substantial, meaningful impact From my experience a fourth point is also vital to delivering the most helpful value for others, and yourself:<br /><br />Recognize the Need to Feel Needed and Connected<br /><br />In art as in life it is often a matter of where you draw the line, the saying goes, and to succeed at work you need to draw a line to create healthy boundaries. Sacrificing your precious time with closest friends, colleagues and family members because you are devoting it to too many others may not be judicious choice for the self-care that Grant advocates.<br /><br />Grant Packs Many Actionable Insights Into Give and Take<br /><br />His many thoughtful insights on productive giving can help us hone our approach. This is one of those books you will find yourself underlining every other sentence before giving up and recognizing it will become a handy guide to which you will return and re-read as situations crop up. All nine chapters were sequentially helpful, including these topics: How Givers, Takers, and Matchers Build Networks; How to be Modest and Influence People; Why Some Givers Burn Out But Others Are on Fire; and Overcoming the Doormat Effect. As Grant noted on his Facebook page (generously citing others, of course), \\"Ultimately, I focused on success because there has been surprisingly little written about how helpfulness influences productivity, work quality, promotions, and other objective measures of achievement and performance in organizations. By contrast, there are quite a few excellent books that deal with giving and happiness (see The How of Happiness by Sonja Lyubomirsky [[ASIN:0143114956 The How of Happiness: A New Approach to Getting the Life You Want]], Happy Money by Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton [[ASIN:1451665067 Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending]], The Happiness Project by Gretchen Rubin [[ASIN:006158326X The Happiness Project: Or, Why I Spent a Year Trying to Sing in the Morning, Clean My Closets, Fight Right, Read Aristotle, and Generally Have More Fun]], and [[ASIN:076792018X Why Good Things Happen to Good People: How to Live a Longer, Healthier, Happier Life by the Simple Act of Giving]]  by Stephen Post and colleagues).\\"other sentence before giving up and recognizing it will become a handy guide to which you will return and re-read as situations crop up.

B004DLPXAO|2.0|This is an OK reader, but my main usage with a nexus 7 is kids books.  And, of course, that means bedtime books.  The reader, however, has a super bright white border filling the empty space between your book and the device's screen.  Depending on aspect ratio, this can be huge, rendering the reader terrible for kids bedtime story (picture) books.  One look at one example (eg little blue truck) would make it obvious to all but the most obscure developer that the default background should be black (off).  Which makes me question how much, or rather how little, effort, they put into making this app useful.  Perhaps the developers should try using it.  Or, at least, make it an option.
B004AP09CU|4.0|I cannot believe this album is really more than 30 years old. I remember it like it was yesterday. It is probably my second favorite Bruce album next to The Wild,The Innocent and the E-Street Shuffle.<br />It contains 2 of my favorite Bruce songs &#34;The Promised Land&#34; and 'Prove it All Night&#34;. A Springsteen must!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game! My whole family plays it!! U NEED TO GET IT.. SO I RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET IT!!!!!!! :)
B00004R95G|5.0|I saw this play on tour in Minneapolis in the early 90s ~ it was excellent!  It was fun to revisit that time via DVD.  Hilarious, touching, joyful....it has a little bit of everything, and stays very true to the Biblical accounts.  Moves along quickly.  When originally seen live, there were parts that made you think you were watching the final act - and REALLY hope it wasn't over yet because it was so entertaining.<br /><br />Love the music/soundtrack ~ gets me humming/singing for days after I watch it.<br /><br />Family Friendly Rating:  There are a couple parts that aren't appropriate for children, the segment with Potiphar's wife (a group of people writhing on a round bed ~ YEESH!), and some of the costumes with Pharaoh (Elvis segment ~ women in &#34;blue suede&#34; body leotards with shimmery silver triangles on the groin areas).  If I could skip over these two parts, it would definitely be something I would show to my Sunday school kids.  It's very entertaining, fun, and tells the story.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game. Sometimes you can't pick up stuff you need. Can't wait for new levels. Good job. Keep them coming.

B00AF6MF9I|3.0|So I'm a level 19, I will attack smaller levels who's attacks are nowhere near as strong as mine and they win. And today I've attacked like 7 in a row and they all just happen to use the same power up to while me out. Just saying if those were at least split apart...I would think it a coincidence. But 7 in a row seems unlikely...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am in love with this game. It is very addiction and keeps you occupied. It seems to never get old with the new themes and things to collect thanking the Subway Surfer team. For a free app, you aren't losing anything downloading it. So give it a try!

1781162646|5.0|I have seen many of King's movies, but am sorry to say that I had never read any of his work. Saw him being interviewed and was charmed by his personality. This book sounded like a great read and a good introduction to his story telling. So glad I decided to read it. Wasn't sure what to expect, was ready for a very scary read and  3/4 of the way through the book, I realized the writing was so good, the story line so interesting, that scary wasn't even a consideration....this was just a great read. Were there moments in the story that got my attention? Of course; it's Stephen King.....love the book.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I think this is fun but I wish you could get everything from this app it would be better but on the second picture it had all this hair color and believe me it's hard to do that so...
B000A6CLL0|4.0|While season three introduces us to the newest threat to the evolving federation it also shows a weakness in the stories that the writers made for the third season as well. The new enemy threat felt too much like a copy of what the Dominion was in Deep Space 9 though not too much but it can be seen. The season gives us more history also of the early triumphs and tragedies of the infant federation as the Enterprise captain and crew meet new aliens and new civilizations and also get into one spot of trouble after another too.<br /><br />The cast still act their roles very well so kudos to them and of course the special effects are nicely done as well but a decent budget didn't hurt either.Overall the season was entertaining to watch and worth getting especially if you already have the first two seasons already.
B00847KFDS|5.0|John has still got it! Great album and great guest appearances by a lot of great artists! One of my favorite new albums.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|What an awesome flick for kids and adults. The story is really pretty good but the detail in the animation will leave you saying &#34;wow!!&#34;.  Watch it once for fun then watch it again and really pay attention to the incredible visuals!

B0091ICDHU|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Colleen Hoover and it certainly will NOT be the last. I am a new fan and Ms Hoover is added to my auto-buy list. Gee whiz, what a book! As you may be able to tell, I absolutely loved Slammed and I am excited to read Point of Retreat and then This Girl. Slammed was full to the brim with emotion and intense romance with such addiction that I couldn't put it down. The characters are all so lovable and the quirky behaviour of Layken, her brother Kel and mother, Julia was fun.<br /><br />After the tragic and unexpected loss of her Father, Layken (Lake), Kel and their Mum moved to Michigan. Layken has been the strong one for Kel and her Mum, trying to help Kel cope with the loss. Driving the moving truck, Layken pulls into their new home. Kel hops out and finds a new best friend within 5 minutes. Caulder lives across the street and they are the same age of 9.  Next Will comes to investigate; he is Caulder's older brother and sole carer. There seemed to be a connection with Lake and Will at first site.<br /><br />Will asks Lake out on a date and takes her to a club where he is a regular, but only because Thursday's is open mike night. This is something very strange to Lake, but she is curious. Will introduces Lake to slamming, a way of expressing yourself with poetry. Will loves slamming and loves watching the performances. Lake is speechless, but she loves it.<br /><br />Will and Lake become instant friends and hopefully more; they love hanging out together and with their brothers getting so close, it is inevitable that their relationship would progress. With the start of school, it is discovered that rightfully Will and Lake cannot be together. UH-OH!<br /><br />Well, this isn't how it was meant to go! Now that they know, their plans have come to a halt. There is no way they are allowed to become more than friends. There is so much frustration and tension between them that it affects Lake's school work. How will they manage to keep apart? What will Julia think of everything? Julia is pretty cool and relaxed, but even she has boundaries when it comes to these types of relationships.<br /><br />Can Lake and Will overcome their situation and say bugger it all, we need to be together? What will everybody think?<br /><br />I love the interactions between Lakes little family; how they allow Kel to have a backwards day where he does and says everything backwards. It's fantastic! And how Lake has tantrums, just like a normal teenager, but most times she is the mature sister that puts Kel first. The writing style was extremely easy to read and the intense emotion within, man, I was sobbing along with Lake throughout. This is definitely a must read to everybody!!part?

B000JQTWPO|5.0|It'd be redundant for me to repeat that everyone from Conan Doyle through Christie right up to today's finest(?) mystery writers owe their genre to Willkie Collins but how anyone can claim to be love mysteries without reading where they all started could certainly be called a mystery too.
B00AFPTSI0|3.0|The thesis of this book is simple. The givers do well (often best) in the long run (but not always well on the short run). Then the book proceeds to tell what are seemingly 10,000 stories to backup that hypothesis.<br /><br />I wish the author had went into finer points of giving. What type of giving is best when dealing with takers and matchers? Should givers seek appreciation? After all, givers can give something which even the taker wouldn't want. In such instances, givers can be annoying. What is a proper way to give to people? What kind of questions should the giver be asking so the giver is not projecting his/her needs onto others? As an example, how many times have people bought you a highly unwanted gift with a claim \\"I have bought the most perfect gift for you!\\" There is an art to giving, a topic which the book seems skip as much as it can.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)Simple and elegant thesis, much of it derived from empirical psychological studies.<br />2)Good first few chapters.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1)The book is full of endless stories which seem to harp on the same theme.<br />2)Doesn't dig too deep into the art of giving. OK, giving is good. I get it. But tell me the best practices and issues involving giving.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My son loves this show! I think it is a great idea that there is no talking as it allows kids to use their imagination!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Really really liked the male POV but I got a bit tired of it. I couldn't connect as much with the MC and it was a little silly. I liked it though, it was a quick and good read.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Felt like the book was trying too hard, like maybe she had two books of story but stretching it to 3, now 4. Still, have to read to follow Gideon and Eva's story, and not bad by any stretch, just didn't work for me as well as the first 2
B000067J1H|4.0|I like this movie. I had to buy it to do a report about this movie. It arrive on time and the prices was cheaper. It well worth it.

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|WOW. I must say, that was very touching. If you are looking for a story to melt your heart, this is so the one.  A wonderful story about a medical miracle, Auggie brings joy and looks beyond the discrimination with a bold face.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|IMHO This game is the best in the Temple Run series right now. The graphics look very good on the Kindle Fire and it runs well without issues. I've put less than 2 weeks into it and have nothing more to spend coins on, and objectives screen is down to only one achievement 10,000,000 meters ran, I'm at 3,000,000.<br /><br />May take longer for more casual players, but all in all it was a good &quot;run&quot;.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I brought this movie to replace my VHS. I want this in DVD. The prices is right and it arrive on time. I love it
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Trust me! If you are an Eagles fan you will not be let down by this video. I am sixty three years old, (not that it matters) and have been enjoying this band from there early days. They were, and still are a positive influence on song writing, vocal expression, and personal achievements. Their creativity has come with a price that they have paid. I would hope that you would purchase and enjoy this music video. Give it a shot!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Don't get too invested in any of the characters but otherwise, FANTASTIC program.  Definitely don't watch with the kids - an adult only program for sure.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This case works well both in protecting the tablet as well as functioning as a stand.  Recommend it without reservation.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Love this movie and it arrive on time. I've been looking for this movie and everywhere was sold out. Good thing I found it on here. I love it. I have all of the Fast & Furious movie.  It a great prices too. Well worth it and shipping on time.
B00684J49U|5.0|I forgot how incredibly sad season 8 was.  I thought Mark & Lexie's story had still so much more to say, and I'm hoping Mark and Lexie will &#34;come back&#34; in a dream sequence.
B00D6BQG1W|1.0|Worst movie I have seen in a long time.  If I hadn't paid for it, I would have turned it off in the first 10 minutes.  I kept thinking it would improve.  I mean, after all, I am a zombie lover...ha.  But the dialogue and the concept is ridiculously lame.
0316286869|4.0|I bought this book to learn a little about make up for shooting portraits. As a photographer it is important to understand make up so you can either help with the application or better convey to your make up assistant what you are looking for in a particular shoot. This book is a good reference for that.
B000HF2NTE|4.0|It has a lot of action in it and the way he make smart mouth comments are funny to me
B004JN1D2I|3.0|No Tyrion, Dany, or Jon, and a whole lot of new people I just could care less about. I'm sure they'll be important later. Or not. Cersei became weak and whiney for much of the book. Loved Brienne and Jaimie's stories, Sam, Arya and Sansa were enjoyable if drawn out. The Dornish only got interesting in the end. I just didn't feel a strong pull for all the characters like I had in the other books. I realize there's a lot of background to set, I just feel it could have been done in a way where we care about the new characters like the old. I suppose not everyone can be a strong interesting character. Overall liked the book though.
B009SQOGZ2|1.0|This movie was very demonic, contained lots of witchcraft. As an adult there were some parts that I couldn't stand to look at. My son told me they had the nerve to show this movie in school!! I wish I would have known because I would have called the principal. This movie is bound to give your children nightmares. DON'T WATCH IT!! There is nothing family oriented about this movie at all.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|My favorite, so far of the books of the author, I have read.  Will soon be on to the next one.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|This game requires 1.2 gigabytes on my kindle fire and i only have 1.12 available it is unable to be used and i had already cleared so much stuff out to try and use this app. 1 out of 5 personally.
B0067EKY7M|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie, was encouraged to watch it by a friend...it didn't meet my expectations at all.  Wish it would have been more about salmon fishing in the Yemen, and less about a relationship.
B007V9N5R8|2.0|The manufacturer raved about how much I needed this product but I don't get it. Very poor customer service and I am still waiting for answers regarding color space settings in LR and PS CC. This product is only really useful if your entire office uses it and all your friends. The Munki made my iMac monitor too dim and my Epson prints still don't match the monitor although that could certainly be MY problem. The ColorChecker seems to be overpowering and puts neon colors where I don't want them. This could be my lack of expertise and perhaps life will be more wonderful ...<br />Added later:  They are supposed to send me a rebate of $35 and I still haven't seen it. I had to cut up the UPCs on the boxes which was annoying. I hate rebates because I rarely actually receive them and then so much time passes that I forget about them which is what they are hoping for I guess. Sigh.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I have ever read. I hate reading but after the movie I felt lost. Can't wait to read the next one. This makes 3 books I have read total in my life.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|For anyone who enjoys  Darius' voice, this CD is a winner.  There are several sing-along songs, which I love; I also love Darius' &#34;story&#34; songs.  A real hit!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great!!!  My grandson and all the other people that have played this game love it.  Hope to order more games in the future.
B007P06DOK|5.0|Bought the album because of the Graceland song.  Paul Simon was one of my favorite artists of the 70's - enjoy listening to the CD and going down memory lane.
0815411839|4.0|STILL THE MOST RIVETING, FLAWLESSLY RESEARCHED, WRITTEN, AN INTELLIGENTLY INTERPRETED MARILYN MONROE BIOGRAPHY ON THE MARKET, TO DATE.  THE BOOK IS LONG AND THICK AND, THUSLY, IS NOT SUITED TO BEING AN PUT INTO AN OVERSIZED PAPERBACK EDITION---THE COVER NEEDS TO BE OF HEAVIER STOCK AND THE PHOTOGRAPH REPRODUCTIONS DARKENED TO SHOW DETAIL AND CLARITY.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Want to build, dig, create in various mediums-- MINE-CRAFT it's absorbing and addictive, especially to the 5 year old who even has the T-shirt.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Well I love this app! It works really good on tablets but it seems 2 slowdown cellular devices.. so I simply don't play it on my phone :)<br />It's a very common,fun,game that keeps u busy when bored!
B00005NKKZ|5.0|Brings back so many memories!  Had this as an &#34;album&#34; many many years ago.  Glad I bought the CD - I love listening to it.  I'm old school and haven't jumped into the iPod electronic media world yet.  Showing my age... but love listening to the guys!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|we love it!!!!!!!!!!  WE REALLY ENJOYED IT!!!!!!  IT WAS AWSOME. IT WAS JUST LIKE THEY SAID, GREAT PRODUCT. TRUELY REPRESENTED RIGHT.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin Hayward music is perfect.  We love this album as much as all his other work, whether it is solo or with the Moody Blues.  Justin's music only gets better with age.  We're looking forward to hearing more.
B0006OFM62|4.0|The Wallace Collection isn't my favorite band, but I like their sound.  Think of hanging out with friends in a coffee house with wine and apertifs.  Maybe it's not your cup of tea all the time, but it can be fun every so often.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|OKAY! Joe is BACK! Just listened to \\"Doubleback\\" and can I say....HOT! Now I love me some Joe folks...have been trying to see him in concert forever but alas haven't made it happen...so I collect anything Joe. I have his DVD Live in Japan...which I've been listening to the CD in my car everyday for the last few weeks...now I have something NEW to play in the car!<br /><br />From the first song \\"Something for You\\"...you find yourself rocking and grooving and it doesn't stop! My favorite that I have been playing over and over and I just got the CD today is for sure....\\"Sexy\\"! Work it Joe!
B004LQEYAG|5.0|I wasn't sure Paul Newman and Robert Redford could pull off a western or a comedy. I am very glad to say I was wrong! This movie has something for everyone no matter what age
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you have read &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;  you will love this one. It gives the reader understanding of the Afgan history and culture, a country of ancient and modern ways.  You are taken on a journey through the lives of a struggling family and their neighbors from the poorest of circumstances to the richest, from Kabul to Paris to California.
B007N8RULO|2.0|Would be great- but between EVERY GAME- there's an ad, and if it's a video ad it freezes everything up and goes to a white screen!  Very the frustrating!
B005OYHF0A|5.0|This book helps you understand Seams and Wraps and other strategies to work with legacy code.  If you are a TDD person and would like to know the proper way of breaking up code so they can be put into a test harness, get this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and addictive. I went to bed and woke up playing again. Solving the puzzles is challenging but not so hard that you cant do it. More levels please!!
B00CM9JKQM|3.0|The story of Queensryche is fairly well documented, even on these reviews.  You have a band that made great music in the 80's, but once the 90's hit the quality started to suffer, releasing mostly good, except q2k, albums in the 90's.  Then a key member left and the band let Geoff Tate lead them into a downward spiral of mediocrity that I can't recall another band I like ever touching.  Finallly Dedicated to chaos came out, after I'd given up on them all together and the fans had finally had enough.  And, apparently the band did too as Tate was kicked out after a number of incidents.  Then of course all the legal BS I won't get into, 2 albums under the same band name etc.<br /><br />I was eagerly awaiting this release, ever since I heard Tate was fired and a version of Queen of the ryche with new singer Todd on vocals.  I felt they had a chance to recapture some of what they'd lost, and possibly em as a fan again.  I was a bit concerned when I fist heard Redemption.  Now I ended up really liking the song, but it took me a couple listens, and this was the first single.  I generally hope the singles will catch my attention right away.  But it did turn out to be a song I enjoyed, so my hopes were still fairly high.  Then all the overly glowing reviews came out, though I'd bought this the day it came out anyways, and I was more stoked.<br /><br />This wasn't exactly what I had in mind, but it can be a nice step forward for the band.<br /><br />I'll go ahead and get the negativity and why my rating is only passible out of the way.  The production is s--t.  Some will say it's better than Tate's FU, but that doesn't take much, so that's still not praise.  I can barely hear the rhythm guitars in several songs.  The chorus for Where dreams go to die, for example, would be a lot better with guitars, which I know exist as I've barely heard, on headphones before, playing in the background to give it a fuller sound.  Also there's an occasional annoying hiss on some of the highernotes.  Overall I'm beyond dissatisfied with this aspect of the album.<br /><br />The songs are decent, but there aren't any songs that really capture my attention.  If I rated the songs out of 10 most would get 6's and 7's.  Not bad and even pretty good, but nothing outstanding.  Many songs seemed rushed, for example, I'd like to have more of a build up to the chorus in Spore, but I did see someone post on here that they were rushed a bit by the record company, so I will forgive them this.  Being rushed would also explain the shortness of the album, only 9 actual songs.<br /><br />Now a couple aspects I really was impressed by are the drumming and the vocals.  Scott sounds re-energized and seems to play with passion, as much as one can tell from a drum set.  Todd's vocals are also really good.  Todd sounds enough like classic Tate, when Tate could sing, but brings something his own to the table too.  Some have asked why a band would get a singer who sounds \\"exactly\\" like the previous singer, which Todd doesn't.  Well as a band you'd want to be able to perform your previous albums, well the 80's and 90's stuff for this band, and have them sound as much like the originals as possible.  As a fan if I were attending a concert I'd want to hear Queen of the ryche and Walk in the shadows as close to their original form as possible.  And let's face it.  Even if Tate were willing to do those songs anymore, he lacks the vocal ability to perform them well at this stage.  There's no shame in this.  Jimmy page once toured with the Black crowes to perform songs from Led Zeppelin's discography he couldn't perform with Robert Plant, they'd toured recently at this point as well.  So, I think Todd did an excellent job of having his own sound and making it make sense and fit in with the Queensryche sound.<br /><br />Overall the band sounds re-energized, what I can hear of them anyways thanks to the horrific production.  As a fan it's nice to hear them playing music they want to playand not sound like they're playing on a solo album for an egotistical jerk.  I can't help but think of Megadeth's the world needs a hero, which while not a great album was sort of a righting the ship for that band, and I hope this will be the same case for Queensryche.  And this album is way better than that Megadeth album.<br /><br />Tate could only say fU in the most direct way possible, whereas Queensryche said it with the music.  I am very hopeful for the future of this band and look forward to some great music in the future.  If you haven't paid attention to this band in ages, have been disappointed/disgusted, with their music this is definitely something you should check out.  Most people are giving this rave reviews and it's definitely a worthy installment into the Queensryche discography, moreso than anything from Q2k through fu.  So, overall this is a solid album, just not as great as I think they're capable of in the future.<br /><br />Oh and funny side note..  I enjoy that this album already has more than tripple the 5 star reviews of Tate's fu.  It makes me smile:)  teheeee...
0802473156|5.0|Highly recommended for all newly married couples or those just engaged.<br />I will be giving this book as a gift to many!

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I am fairly new to the world of PC gaming, and bought this mouse because playing with my track pad was getting annoying.<br /><br />This mouse is extremely easy to use, and has a fantastic price. The downloadable software is available at ianker.com and allows you to customize your mouse color, the functions the buttons play, and much more.<br /><br />This mouse looks and feels amazing. The thumb buttons are perfectly located, and the grip underneath the buttons works quite well. The mouse is well shaped for the hand, very light and comfortable.<br /><br />Four dpi setting allow you to change how sensitive your mouse is, and allows you to personalize how you play.<br /><br />As my first gaming mouse, I am extremely pleased with the perchase.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fun read for the summer quick delivery also!<br />Good author and fun trilogy<br />No impact other than it was a great guilty pleasure
0062073567|3.0|I am writing this review with mixed feelings about the book. I personally anticipated the ending before I was halfway through the book, so I am surprised that many people reviewing the book felt cheated/upset/even angry at the ending. There were many little items in the story that pretty clearly led to one and only one conclusion, so my disappointment was more to do with the fact that I was not surprised by the ending. Having said that, the story line was very original and adopted a pattern I have not come across before. All in all, a book worth reading.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I loved this book. Great back story, New life, New romance. Just bought the next two books in the series. I highly recommend this book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun to play, but some of the levels are a bit confusing. Good way to pass time. Not too bad.
B006Z9K97E|4.0|I did not know if i'd cope reading about his tragic life but the more i read the more i wanted to read and make sure he was okay. What tragedy to have been born into that life but what a triumph to be able to say he is now free. Absolutely amazing.

B004H4XDBI|5.0|This book was amazing. I never wanted to stop reading. The dedication they have to each other. For a while I thought it was going to go in a completely different direction  than it did. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ALREADY read if I stay. If you font you will get so lost in the story line
0783240287|5.0|Such a great production.  I saw it live in Chicago many years ago.  I also have the CD of these songs and I listen to them as often as to Eric Clapton.

0525478817|5.0|I have broken John Green ground, finally! Thank you to everyone who voted for this book during my April book poll. As difficult as this book was, I thank you all for giving me the push to finally dive in. I am happy to have finally experienced John Green's brilliance. He certainly knows how to tell a story, and more importantly, how to write characters.<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus. I am not even sure what to say about these two characters that would prove the magnitude of their presence and spirit in this book. Both are afflicted with different types of cancers, in different stages and with different outcomes. Both have been through utter hell and continue to experience the physical and emotional pain and suffering of terminal illness. However, there are times where I would not have even remembered they were sick, had it not been for Hazel's need for oxygen and Augustus' limp. When they found one another, they both started to truly live again. And live they did. They had big moments and small moments and glorious moments and devastating moments. But they experienced them all together, basking in the glow of their new found love and respect. That \\"for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health\\" marriage vow was never more apparent in any story than it was with Hazel and Augustus. And they were teenagers who were not married, nor thinking about it. There was just so much truth and honesty inside them both that it burst out to envelop the other. Not to mention, they were like two peas in a pod. It's definitely hard to put into words the perfect imperfection these two characters were together.<br /><br />And I just have to talk about Augustus all by his onesies. This young man was AH-mazing. He was full of lust for life, and despite his illness, lived life to the absolute fullest. Never once did I see negativity or pessimism cross this young man's thoughts. He was romantic and nerdy and fun. He was also very compassionate and humble. This guy had it all, and I will never forget what a beautiful character he is, and how much he made my heart smile in this book.<br /><br />This book was much more than a book about kids with cancer. It was about living life and taking risks and being in love and exploring the world and enjoying beauty and the inner strength people can muster when life hands them a basket full of lemons.  Believe it or not, I did not ugly cry. My eyes teared up, and I put the book down numerous times to gather myself, but I did not sob myself to sleep. I held on tightly to the beauty of the character's life-altering experiences, and it got me through the book. I am really happy that I've been digging my heels into YA contemporary books more than I ever have. There are some incredible gems out there and I look forward to reading all of John Green's work.<br /><br />Favorite Scene<br />\\"May I see you again?\\" he asked.

B002JXK5VU|5.0|Normal, non-scientific law enforcement officer ends up in a quirky, highly scientific town. Entertainment ensues. Comic soap opera love stories develop slowly and satisfyingly, criminal storylines are interesting and include good plot twists, and the ever-present backdrop of world-class scientific research keeps things lively.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|pretty well done just would like more decks you can build yourself but overall fun to see the new cards since I stopped playing years ago
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Love this series because it's so unique and I'm not the type of person to follow a TV series. Waiting on season II.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Nothing less then what was expected for one of the most great concerts of all time for sure, just perfect.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I am not a huge fan of zombie lore, but I was sucked into the amazingly detailed stories told by these fictional survivors of World War Z. Max Brooks provides a beautifully vivid world of sadness, isolation, survival, and horror; not through the stereotypical zombie imagery but the effect it had on people from all over the world. It was a breath of fresh air to read a zombie novel that promoted the human spirit of survival, especially among the apocalypse-driven plots we have become used to seeing. Good job, Brooks.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|Have always been a huge dinosaur fan and these movies bring them to life.<br /><br />The second one is weaker, but overall a great time

B00866H7SS|5.0|I wrote a review back in July 2013 and since then I have read this book three times.  I just finished it again because Book 4 just came out and I wanted to refresh my memory and get the feel of the storyline. It is 1/9/15.   I must admit that I never tire of this book.  It is fantastic.  One cannot help but have a thing for Gideon Cross.  He is  hot, hot, hot.  I have seen this book compared to 50 Shades.  Trust me, in no way should one try to compare this book to 50 Shades.  It is much, much better.  From the characters to the storyline to the sensual scenes, Bared to You tops 50 Shades.      Between the two heroes, Gideon has the most pull.  I could feel his power, his masculinity and oh how so handsome he was....the power that spilled from him wherein with Christian Grey I felt no such thing.  I had no pull whatsoever with Christian Grey.  What I love about Ms. Day's writing is that even though Gideon Cross is around 30 years of age, he seemed more mature....capable of running a vast empire.   Gideon Cross's persona could resonate with women much older than the characters.  I love the character of Gideon.  He represented power, strength, virility and handsome.  Ms. Day made you forget at how young Gideon really was because of the maturity of his character, wherein Christian Grey acted like a young man and immature in many ways.  Eva got on my nerves a few times but all in all I liked her.  Even though I have the next Cross book lined up to read in my Kindle, I had to read this book twice, back to back.....I loved it so.  There were no boring parts in it, unlike 50 Shades. Where they all do compare is that the characters are damaged in some way, shape or form but then again, in your Vampire Romance novels, someone is damaged as well.  However, it is how the characters are presented that makes a difference.  I like Vampire and Other World romance novels and basically, if you read one, you've read them all.  The difference is how the characters are portrayed, how the writer writes, and how one resonates with those characters, and Ms. Day does a fantastic job of opening your heart and allowing Gideon Cross to sneak in as well as enjoying the very sexual scenes.  I read one scene to my hubby with Gideon and Eva.....well let us just say that I had my own erotic story that night as well as others!  I did not read any scenes from 50 Shades because Christian was simply two immature and did not resonate with someone of my age.     I could not get enough of Gideon Cross and that is why I have read this book three times, and why I will read it again and have placed it along with my other favorite books to read again and again, unlike 50 Shades which I read because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, which was not much.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have been a huge fan since I saw A New Hope in my parents'station wagon at the drive-in. Yes Lucas changes things around, but for the better.  It does not detract from the overall experience and story.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I head leadership development for one of the most valuable companies in the world. While directed towards entrepreneurs and small business owners, the elements captured in Rework provide open windows for fresh thinking within bureaucratic hell. I encourage transformational leaders operating in corporate environments to take these concepts to practice. (Transactional managers need not apply. Rework will take you too far.) Stretch yourselves<br /><br />Thanks for the inspirational read!

B00CDT41RY|5.0|I like the attention Quentin Tarantino pays to details when making movies. Its a typical Quentin Tarantino movie with carefully picked dialogs, costumes, story, shooting locations etc.<br />A very fine piece of work I must say.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I am very impressed with this dog. The book had me thinking about ways to better myself. Listening, living, and savoring the moments.<br />A must read for anyone, not just dog lovers.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I find as I have begun reading the first book, that it helps me to understand the television series much better.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I have the entire series in my library (I am a school librarian), and never understood why this series is not popular. Now I know why... it is boring!<br /><br />I bought the kindle edition when it was on sale for $1.99 a while back.  I am glad I did not spend too much money on it.  Never have I read such poorly developed plot.  The author kills so many characters it makes one wonder if she will continue adding more characters in each book, since she loves to kill them off so much.  Nothing wrong with that, but since she kills them off so quickly there is no character development.  The reader just does not care enough to read on.<br /><br />The story is good for about the first fifty pages, after that it is so convoluted sometimes its hard to figure out who's talking.  For parents I can say this is a safe read for teens as there is no vulgar language or explicit sex scenes. There is mild to moderate violence, but is not morbid.<br /><br /> I do not plan to read the rest in the series, can't deal with the teenage drama. I can't believe they are making this into a movie.  I wonder how they will handle all those characters that appear all of a sudden and then die off soon after.  We'll see in August.

B002JCSWV6|5.0|Great Movie! I only regret not seeing it sooner! This is such a powerful and inspiring movie, I strongly believe everyone should watch this!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Just started this game and love it. Makes me miss my horses even more. Great graffics but wish it would move a little faster. Don't like having to put it down to wait for lightning bolts to build up.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|I don't watch much television; but I started watching this w/my wife after she got hooked. Now I am hooked too; in fact I like it as well or better - leaning more toward better - than any other crime drama series I've ever watched. It is now the #1 ranked TV show, which is no surprise. Just finished watching the first three seasons on DVD and I have nothing but praise...from the stories, to the casting, to the snappy and often funny dialogue. And Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Harmon) is the best team chief ever in a crime drama. Nothing but praise and my highest recommendation!!
B000B8QG22|5.0|This is just an amazing movie! Robin Williams is one of the best actors there is! This movie is a great combination of a wide variety of emotions; you will laugh, you will probably cry, and you will definitely love this movie!
B000JMLDCS|3.0|I like to read Christian classics but it isn't a fast or an easy read because it is really deep.  I got it a while back and still haven't finished reading it.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Pat Solitano, played exceptionally well by Bradley Cooper, is bipolar and has just been released from a mental institution for violent episodes which have estranged him from his wife. Excelsior (ever upward) is one of the catch phrases used at the institution (along with &#34;silver linings&#34; - as in looking for) and both are frequently repeated during the film. Still thinking his marriage is salvageable, Pat is trying to put his life back together when he meets Tiffany Maxwell, who has been recently widowed and is also troubled emotionally. Tiffany is played by a 21 year old Jennifer Lawrence in a career defining performance...her Oscar was well deserved. In addition to trying to win back his wife, Pat also tries to mend fences with his father (played with usual excellence by Robert De Niro) who also has similar bipolar-type mental issues. Tiffany and Pat, through the medium of dance, help each other out...and the mutual assistance story becomes a love story...an exceptional love story. In addition to the principles, look for fine support performances from Jacki Weaver as Pat's mother; Julia Styles as Tiffany's sister, Veronica; and John Ortiz as Veronica's husband. This is one of those highly acclaimed films that certainly lives up to all the hype; and my only caveat is the distraction caused by pervasive profanity...the movie would have been so much more enjoyable to watch without it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooo fun. The only thing is the ads. Their really annoying.! Five Stars!!!! Love it. I reccomend it.
B0017XD3OY|3.0|Post-apocalyptic option. One o many. Will Smith is ok. Just don't ask him about plot holes. Mike Patton makes great monster noises (with the help of effects devices of course).
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|I am a die hard fan  a lot of action  father screws it up from the start then helps out his son  just another day with john
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I needed a lot of help with his one.  The map really helped.  I plan to play again and hopefully do better.  It is definitely a challenge.

B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Kool but glitches on my kindle fire HD for like 30 mins. It is so fun to play with Sun gods and to go monkeys. I once got 11 BADS (Bloom Airal Denial System)  and 3 temple of the monkey god. Really fun to play, buy this game!!!!!!!!
0812983459|3.0|I enjoyed certain parts of the book but there were other chapters I skipped through.  At one point it reminded me of the movie Forest Gump.

B00004WEJZ|5.0|one of Connery's best, a remake of &#34;Thunderball&#34; but very well done. The villain is one of the best. The exploding villainess is great.
B0043VDIAG|3.0|I enjoyed this story, it has that nice forming love in it - slow and steady as two people learn that they like and trust each other. Surprise ending, and really sweet. The only thing I wish he did more of was to have some love scenes like Nora Roberts or some of the other authors out there. 5 stars for the story but I only gave him 3 because even though it was sweet, I like sex in a book! I won't buy any of his again. There is no sex at all in this book in case you are wondering....
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love love love pinterest.  I search recipes, party ideas, gifts, fashion, etc.  It is my go to for information.  These boards are so very creative.  I don't know what I did without it.
B003HZGT32|5.0|After I turned 40 I never thought I'd be listening to Melodic Death or Doom Metal (not really up on which is which, sorry), but I bought this album because I was looking for something new and was blown away. How can it be so dark, brooding, and haunting while so atmospheric and beautiful? Who knows, but I love it! The guitars are wonderful and the vocals are perfect for the music, which is some of the most evocative I've heard. This is brilliance.
0385360169|5.0|So much heat you have to get out of the kitchen!  I can't stop listening to this book.  S-o-o good.
B005LAII6C|5.0|I loved ParaNorman. A great story with laughs for kids and adults who are familiar with the classic horror movies. It may be a bit scary for those under 8 though?<br /><br />The movie is a beautiful lesson for children (and adults), do not judge others and be true to yourself.
B00BYISQTO|4.0|Still lacks the energy of Alligator and other previous efforts, but they seem to be getting back on track.  The only weak song here is &#34;Don't Swallow the Cap&#34; which, for some reason, was released as the first single.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I loved every minute of the CD.  I don't know if it will appeal to everyone, but it will certainly appeal to baby boomers.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|This CD is fantastic.  His best work to date.  If you like Jason Mraz, try John Mayer or Maroon5.  Namaste.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Got into this late but have caught up and just love it.  My husband started watching with me at season 2 with with WWI connection and is also hooked, loving history and good character development.

B007MAETA8|5.0|I am highly selective and this passes my most critical tests.  I hope you enjoy it as much as his other recordings.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great love story!  I could not stop reading this book! I can not wait to download walking disaster next! She is now one of my favorite writers!
B008476HBM|5.0|I usually can't really get into the classics, but this was a very riveting and enlightening book. I recommend it.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I really don't know what to say.  We have all of his music and go his concerts whenever he is in the States.  I only wish he spent more time here, so he would be accessible to his U.S. fans.<br />We love all types of music and including opera and some musicals.  He gives you this and way more with his extraordinary voice!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|My husband purchased this book for my Kindle Fire to remind and encourage me to push through my insecurities at my workplace and to remind me I'm stronger than Igive myself credit for.This book did just that. I found myself agreeing with Sheryl Sandberg most of the time, but half way through the book I felt I was at a seminar to encourage feminism, this left me frustrated and at times lost my interest. Overall I would recommend this book and may even pick it up again if I need another pick me up.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Pretty cool so far.just anxious to see how far I can go before I haft to spend money on everything
B001AW156U|1.0|I originally wrote in asking why people complain they fall off easily..well on my second pair of these, one of the triggers will NOT stay on. When they work they do work, but they seem to have a high defect rate. You might get a trigger or two that does not stay on at all, or you may be lucky and get the 5 star product that it does stay on. it does feel better when it works, but since i'm stuck with a second pair that doesnt work, and i lost my first pair, i can't say the quality of this product is anything above shoddy. On second thought though, the triggers arent THAT important..and you really get what you pay for. they help a little bit..when they work, but they still won't feel anything close to the xbox 360. don't bother IMO. Just wait for PS4.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Loved the characters and the historical context of the story about life in those times. Although a long novel, it was interesting and captivating all through it
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another great book by Rollins. Fast paced and the multiple story intertwined seamlessly. I couldn't wait to turn the page.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The trilogy is awesome. The package is pretty cool. The book is a nice piece. As some people has said it before the art could have been better specially since every movie has a magnificent posters but other than that being a Bale-Nolan fan having the entire trilogy in one package is a must. 100% recommended.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I didn't know until I finished the series, but I think it ended how I wanted it to!  Sad that there will be no more Sookie in my future, but glad it ended &#34;happily ever after&#34;!
0425263924|5.0|i loved this book,but wish it did not end the way it did,but a must buy for sure. love  it
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|We really like learning history through movies, this one was very well done, good cast, moving performances, very sad even when you know the ending
B0058A119G|5.0|What wonderful songs to sit back and relax by!<br />Thank you Barbra once again for your great talent.<br />This DVD has beautiful songs that I will cherish listening to for years to come.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Ever since I read the Percy Jackson series I knew I had to read the other books Mr.Riordan wrote, and this book did not fail. The beginning, and end of the book are mysterious and luring for the reader. Overall this book was AMAZING, if I were you I would just buy it, buy the book now and start reading. It's simply the best Rick Riordan book I've read!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I like how a great storyline is used to make an animated film that touches children's lives with such a positive message
0061689246|5.0|For romance fantasy lovers  who have not lost their love of true adventure and high romance, this will be your classic go-to fairy tale for grown-ups!<br />Also, highly recommend any audio version where Neil Gaiman himself is reading his books; a wonderfully straight-forward low-key storytelling voice as if he is weaving the tale just for you and giving room for your imagination to play.
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|I couldn't watch the entire video; it was too hard to concentrate. Also, the packaging was too elaborate. Less packaging could have reduced the cost - the actual DVD disc was the most imprtant thing - all else was hype.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|We know the story of Dorothy by heart, it was fun to learn the story of OZ, colorful, liked the cast
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Solid service. As always I was pleased with the speed of the delivery and the quality of the merchandise. Always my first choice for any purchases online.

B002VUFKG6|5.0|I just started this book last night around 8pm. I finished it in less than 24 hours and feel more enlightened than I ever have not just about marriage but about relationships. I think this covers everything or every question you could or could not put into words. I didn't read eat pray love only watched the movie but I might have to back track now. I almost want to thank the author for such a well developed and conceived literary experience.
B00A27X972|5.0|I loved this book.  I laughed and I cried.  I felt Human.  It's a wonderful story that captures your emotions and makes you feel great.  Thank you Matt!  XOXO

B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I grew up watching the ORIGINAL OZ.<br />And this 2013 OZ movie was beyond HORRIBLE!  Poorly made/poor acting......simply disappointing in every aspect.<br /><br />I do NOT recommend buying this movie. Don't waste your $. There are far better made/ better acting movies out there.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this ap and use it all the time. It's easy to use and the quality of sound is great. Barb
B002C4YYEU|3.0|This movie was OK because it was a different kind of movie than I am accustomed to viewing.  But overall it was kind of sad and depressing.  I was determined to see this, since I missed it at the movies.  So glad I didn't pay big money at the box office.
B00005JNQA|4.0|The movie was really filmed at the Union Nations. Directed by Sidney Pollack. Mr Pollack said it took about a year to get clearance to film at the United Nations. Movie stars Nicole Kidman as Silvia Bloome as a translater at the UN and Sean Penn plays federal agent Tobin Keller. Silvia Bloome hears a potentially explosive secret about a planned assassination attempt. She contects the FBI, but when Agent Keller investigates her claim and digs deeper into Silvia's dangerous past, he begins to question whether she is the victim or a suspect.

B000000OQ5|5.0|Great old Tesla!! If you are a fan, you need this for your collection. I always enjoy the deep cuts that they don't play on the<br />radio. This has them.
1442419814|2.0|\\"Uglies\\" wants to be a new Clockwork Orange. Instead, it is overly preachy, repetitive (how many times can one 'get purchase?'), and the love interest part bores me. I'll probably listen to the second one while working on art, but there isn't much here, and what is there it so forced upon the reader they get sick of it.

0770437400|2.0|I am just going to start off saying that I knew that World War Z was not going to be \\"Literature,\\" and I did not go into it expecting it to be so. I was just hoping for something like literary junk-food--not  nutritional, and not something to indulge in everyday, but fun to have every now and then. However, World War Z was, well, rather lifeless (got to get a zombie pun in there somewhere) and had a lot of flaws.  I also have not seen the movie.<br />One of the biggest flaws is that the book is supposed to be an \\"oral history,\\" which is revealed by many short interviews. Telling the story in this way makes it so that Brooks can avoid things like character building/growth, however, it adds more problems than it solves. Oral storytelling is intimate, and everyone is a little different in how they do it, yet a ll of the narrators, no matter their age, social class, education level, nationality, or gender \\"spoke\\" as if they all had the exact same background. Sure, the Japanese narrators threw in a Japanese word or two to remind us that they were Japanese, but those are about the only clues that the narrator is not another middle-class American. Having all the characters speak with the same \\"voice\\"  made little distinction between the different storytellers, and they all just kind of blurred into one another, flat and forgettable. Of the whole story, only the narrator who worked with the army dogs is memorable to me, and that is pretty sad.  The author also seems to have never met a stereotype he didn't like, so the narrators are things like blind Japanese ninja types or tough-as-nails American army chicks.<br />Picking the format of an \\"oral history\\" also makes the book basically one big infodump. Because the reader is totally dependent on the characters to tell them what happened, this makes the narrators constantly telling the readers really precise details that a reader may find interesting, but it seems unlikely the narrator would actually know.<br />It seems like all the narratives should together add up to something more, but they really don't. With the book being an oral history, we know right from the start that humanity survived. Sure, we get to hear about how the different countries dealt with the zombies, and how they were dealing with the aftermath, but what more do they offer? Even if one looks at World War Z, a \\"history,\\" with the quote \\"those who do not remember history are bound to repeat it\\" in mind, the book offers a pretty lifeless reading. Sure, there is an anti-materialism element to the work, but that is nothing new, and has been done far better by other authors. I'm not looking to be preached too here--that takes away from a book too--but it seems like there should be something a little more than the surface level, yet that doesn't appear to be the case. That surface level is pretty dull too, and somewhat unsatisfying. I'm okay with not knowing exactly why the zombies appeared, but a few hints would have been nice.<br />I guess I'd have to add that World War Z has a lot of pro-American politics. Communism in Cuba and China has been destroyed by the end, as have been the oil fields of Saudi Arabia.  Pakistan and Iran destroy each other, and the North Koreans have blindly followed their leader to a life totally underground. Mexico has been renamed, but for what reason, I honestly have no idea. Oh, and Russia has returned to having Tsars and become really religious while turning women into baby-making machines. I am sure the reader is supposed to think of poorly of them for that, but if the world had a sudden mass depopulation, that would probably be the reality of most of the world, not just Russia. While I am American, these pro-American politics came off as far too obvious, and with far too much bravado.<br />Overall, I'd say skip it.ll the narratives should together add up to something more, but they really don't.

B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|Hard to believe, but 20 years ago Aphex Twin released perhaps an amazing double disk called \\"Selected Ambient Works, Vol. II\\". Many critics and people working even in other genres of music hailed it as masterpiece of electronica and the work of a genius. What was so remarkable about the record was that it was so original that it sounded like nothing else that had come before it. It was eerie, spacey and sometimes even creepy. Time magazine said \\"if aliens communicate, this is what it might sound like\\". But the downside of Selected Ambient Works, Vol. II is that the eerie mood never lets up.<br /><br />I mention this because I get a strong hunch that what Boards Of Canada was trying to achieve was a similiar alien landscape as Aphex Twin but instead making it more listenable and accessible by leaning heavily on atmosphere. Some critics have said Tomorrow's Harvest has no soul, well I disagree with that because there is a pervasive sense of \\"a watcher\\", of someone so numb and disconnected from the world. This is also the first time I've ever heard any electronic act try to build upon the foundation of Selected Ambient Works, Vol. II and actually succeed.<br /><br />But it's not just Aphex Twin that Boards Of Canada seems to be quoting. I hear alot of vintage 70s \\"space rock\\" and new-agey trappings. Tangerine Dream's classics Rubycon and Phaedra come to mind. There are also creepy synth string sounds that recalls the Twin Peaks soundtrack.<br /><br />My first impression of Tomorrow's Harvest is very favorable. I could see this record becoming a classic, but because it references electronica music that's already been made, it could also be a bit of \\"a flash in the pan\\". Time will tell if Boards Of Canada have planted the right seeds. I get a sense they have.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved playing this game. It was not too hard or too easy. Things that took me awhile to figure out were things I should have known so use some common sense when playing.

B00C81LYH2|3.0|Asking to rate a Barbie on its educational value and durability isn't very realistic. No thinking person believes Barbie teaches a kid anything but how to hate their body, and let's be real - a collectable doll isn't meant to be played with. Though I did buy this for my kid to play with.<br /><br />It's a beautiful doll. I remember them as being more \\"bendy\\" as a kid. I also remember the packaging and dolls themselves as seeming more upscale and durable. But that could just be the remembrances of a child.<br /><br />As it is. I think it is a great doll to play with. She is beautiful, her gown is fun and I love the dangle earrings. But if I'd bought her as a collectable item? I would have been sadly disappointed.

B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show. Added this one to the collection. This is one of the funniest shows I can think of since the shows from the 90's like home improvement and roseanne and all those other shows that were actually funny and stayed on the air for more than a year unlike todays shows.
B009E3EY38|4.0|As someone who grew up with LZ, I was afraid that this concert wouldn't live up to the magic of early band. But it really does. Everybody puts out real energy, especially Robert Plant--you can see the years fall off him as the performance proceeds--and everyone seems to be having a terrific time. The playing has lost none of its power, and no one has lost their edge. You can see them feeding each other, getting more coherent and fired up with each passing song.<br /><br />There are two only slight disappointments: First, there is less improvisation than the in the old days, which really is what the band was all about. This performance is very worked out--not, perhaps, as much as most pop acts these days, but the open-ended bits here are short and bookended by predetermined bits. In the old days almost anything could happen, and often did, assuming John Bonham was sober (one of the times I saw them, in Kansas City in 1970, Bonham was so drunk he literally fell off his drum stool). The other slight and unavoidable disappointment is the absence of John. Jason certainly puts out everything he's got, and he's a very solid drummer, but he just doesn't have his dad's feel. But then nobody does. John Bonham was never about what he played, but how he played it: his sense of time, his slight swing feel, and his subdivision of space, his way of hitting the drums. There really isn't any drummer on earth who could fill that spot convincingly, and my heart goes out to Jason having to try. He gets major credit for courage just for sitting down in that drum seat. And he does cop all the essential drum parts, though he loses big points for using a double pedal for the bass drum triplets on Good Times Bad Times--admittedly those are very tricky to do, but that was his dad's signature, and it really ought to be done right.<br /><br />But as I say, these are very slight disappointments, and the concert as a whole is fantastic. It took me back to the glory days in every way. Highly recommended.

B000U0O9FM|5.0|I actually saw the movie before reading the book, so unfortunately, I knew where the plot was headed.  Even so, the book was every bit as gripping as the movie.  I'm not one of those purists who get angry because things in the movie don't match up exactly with things in the book (in fact, I barely remember the details of the movie...only the ending), so I wasn't troubled by any discrepancies.  However, others who are purists may be bothered.<br /><br />The narrative style of this book is probably not for every one.  It's written in first person with a very helter-skelter style, but I loved that.  The jagged, off-beat narrative was a perfect voice to use for this frenetic, depressing plot.<br /><br />To say the story is gritty is like saying the public bathrooms in a city bus station are gritty.  No big surprise there.  But what did surprise me was the depth of insight.  Even as a middle-aged woman, I could relate to some of the things in this book that seemed to be written with disillusioned, young men in mind.  Like I said, the entire thing was gripping.<br /><br />The plot itself is, of course, so overblown as to be ridiculous (as if this could ever happen), but again, it put me in a certain mood.  I was engulfed in it the way I am engulfed by dystopian fiction.  It all seemed right somehow.  Sick, but right.<br /><br />This book isn't for everyone, but I loved it.
B0094MFITS|5.0|Enjoyable made for TV movie. Sheriff in a small town must deal with a serial killer. Though somewhat predictable, I was thoroughly entertained.  You can't go wrong with Tom Selleck.
0920668372|5.0|I absolutely adore this book!<br /><br />My mother would read it to us and I will never forget how she would sing the song with her tune. She would tell us the words of the song randomly also, as kids I remember feeling annoyed when she kept singing it. Now I would give anything to hear her sing it one more time.<br /><br /> The memories I have still bring tears to my eyes when I think about this book. This book holds such a dear place in my heart.<br /><br />I give a copy to all my new mother friends. Definitely a must buy for every mother to share with her little ones.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I love this grip!  Once I put it on my 7D, it never comes off!  Sometimes just to clean it but other than that, it's got a permanent home on my 7D!  Works flawlessly!  Gives a huge boost to the amount of images that can be taken, huge!  If my two batteries separately take say 600 photos each, when they are in the grip, I get closer to 1800 images!!  Seriously!  Don't ask me how, I don't know!  But it's true.  I love this grip and I'm glad I spent the money on it!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Merchandise was brand new and delivery was prompt. I plan to recommend them to both my family and also my colleagues at work.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|This game is pretty slow with not a lot of action. The graphics are nice and the music is very soothing.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I love dogs, and I train them. This book was fascinating, once I got through the first few pages. Until they start searching for the first little boy, I was bored. Really glad I stuck with it. I loved the dog search aspect of it, and I couldn't wait to get to the end to find out how it all played out.  It's a creative, interesting book. I want Nora Roberts to write more of these types.
B00005NKCM|5.0|Great and enjoyable. We have been enjoying watching it as a friends get together. Top notch.<br />Superb acting and directing.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much. The book gave some good insight into its characters' lives. Looking forward to the next one.
B0076HNCTQ|5.0|Just got into TP and totally addicted. I love the first season, second season not so much. if you are a fan of the surreal, suspenseful, somewhat esoteric, see it! I say skip season 2.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|This review is for the 3-disc Blu-Ray 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition version.<br /><br />I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attacked ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh&auml;user Gate. All those... moments... will be lost in time, like [cough] tears... in... rain. Unless, of course, I buy the DVD, in which case I can relive those moments. Again and  [cough] again.<br /><br />Although deciding *which* moment to relive might be a problem. You see, there are at least seven versions of the Truth that I know of. While makes Blade Runner a transdimensional entity spanning a multitude of alternate universes, much like Khan Noonien Singh, since there is no way that Benedict Cumberbatch could sell a car in this timeline, even if it featured the thickly-cushioned luxury of seats made of fine Corinthian leather... but I... [cough] digress...<br /><br />As I was saying, there is the International Cut (also known as Criterion Edition) from 1982, which was more violent than than the US theatrical release (What? Pris holds Deckard up by his *nostrils*? I've heard the expression \\"to get your nose out of joint\\" but this appears to be a very literary interpretation of the idiom). This version was released on VHS and on laserdisc (as the Criterion Collection). Second, there is the US theatrical version, also known as Original Version or the domestic cut, where Batty did *not* gouge Tyrells eyeballs out in an orgy of blood (as he did in the International version). There is also the workprint version which was shown only to a few folks as a preview, but which  was callously distributed in 1991 as the \\"Director's Cut\\" even though Ridley Scott did not  authorize it in any way. Then there is the 'official' Director's Cut, which *was* blessed by Ridley Scott, and released in 1992. Also Ridley Scott's Final Cut, was released in theaters and on DVD in 2007. And let's not forget the so-called \\"San Diego sneak peek cut\\", which was only shown once in 1982. And of course the various broadcast versions, which were edited predominantly to meet TV broadcast standards (so in many of these versions Deckard never asks asks Rachael about reading a magazine, and we never see her response, when she wants to know if Deckard is testing whether she is a replicant or a ... [cough]...)<br /><br />So know the contents of the version you buy. The 3-disc Blu-Ray version includes the Final Cut (disc 1) US theatrical release, the International version, the 1992 directors cut (disc 2), and the rare Workprint release, a documentary (\\"Dangerous Days\\") and a lot of cool stills from the movie (disc 3). It also includes pages sandwiched into the DVD case with some interesting artwork and photos.<br /><br />And now you must excuse me. I'm off to make an origami unicorn.ch was only shown once in 1982.

0425263924|3.0|I did enjoy the first two books in this series, but at this point, I think Sylvia is trying too hard to draw this out. I expected to come to the conclusion of this story in this book, but instead it is set to continue on. At this point, I find myself bored and slightly annoyed. I am not sure if I even care to continue reading in the next installment.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book compares and contrasts the four candidates for the Presidency in 1860.  It explains how the underdog, Lincoln, won the office.  The amazing part of the story, by today's standards particularly, is that this relatively inexperienced President incorporated these rivals into his cabinet during the most difficult time in American history.  The story is rich is detail, and gripping, and begs the question in my mind about why politicians can't work together better in the present.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a cool game to play when I'm bored. u get to brush it and feed it. u also go to completion's.it is really fun.
0812983459|2.0|I liked the concept of this book and was really encouraged by the good reviews...  I'm 100 pages into it and stopped to read more reviews because I was confused as to how I could find a book so dull that others apparently think is wonderful...  Whew... I'm glad to find others who feel this book is just plain slow and boring too - Now I can put it down and move onto something worth reading without feeling like I was stopping just before the story picks up.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was sorry to see this book end.  I so want to know what happens next.  Hope we don't have to wait as long this time.

B00CH26TL8|1.0|This game has fine mechanics and gameplay, but is a shameless money grab.  Getting two stars is pretty easy but three stars requires only lots of luck or Latin  money.  I hate the freemium mechanic that rewards spending money rather than skill.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This puzzle game will challenge your intelligence. Very addictive and fun. Sometimes you look too deep into the puzzle. Sometimes not deep enough.

1439153663|4.0|I liked this book. The characters were interesting and as I got to know them I wanted to find out more, I wanted to see how they developed. As I approached the end of the book I was torn between wanting to find out the ending and not wanting the book to end!

I but all his concert DVD's.....I did manage to see him about the first 6 concerts, dating back to the late 80's, he is so wonderful to see in person!!!!!
0385349947|5.0|The many anecdotes sited by the author create memorable scenarios for the reader to recall when she finds herself in similar situations. The actions recommended by Sheryl are simple and easy to remember. Her advice is not esoteric.  It's  practical and easy to understand.  This book is a must read for any woman beginning a career and might help those who have found their careers to have &#34;fizzled Out.&#34;
B009FZFONO|5.0|(Zombie ^) Great season of television. To anybody who enjoys drama and action, this is the show for you. The zombies play a subtle role in the drama that unfolds on the screen really. Don't HAVE to enjoy zombies to enjoy the walking dead. Just have to have a strong stomach.
B005LAIGRS|4.0|I buy Denzel movies because he is handsome of course, but let's face it - he is an excellent actor! Any role, any character, he brings life and emotion to the characters he plays and you have to awe at his range of talent within his craft. Whether he plays the hero or the villain, he plays the hell out of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's good if you are new to minecraft but it isn't  the same as the pc version though<br />but if you don't want to pay like $30 it's worth it
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|This is a classic American western - the good versus the bad and always triumphs in the end. This is one of my favorite John Wayne westerns - if I bought all John Wayne movies, I wouldn't have room for nothing else. John personified the American hero and will never die.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|If you currently have a wall adapter or cord, and you are purchasing this for the length then save yourself the trouble. It is only a out 40 inches. False advertising. If you just need a  office your wall jack - then I guess it is fine. I am returning it.
B0045HCJSK|5.0|Wow! this is another classic western - clean, good for the entire family. This movie speaks to wholesomeness. John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Walter Brennan all together to get the bad guys and they do just that!!! Love this movie.
B000E9910W|5.0|Great collection.  Good mix of their oldest stuff and later songs after Michael M. Joined the group.  Can't help but sing along.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|This adapter is awesome. I purchase a TV stand with a built in iPod adapter, but I have a kindle fire and I download a lot of music and wanted to play it so my daughter went to amazon and found it. I tell you its really awesome.

B002ZG99G8|5.0|I really loved the movie the Losers! Is Dont Stop Beleivin' Chris Evans/Jenson's theme song or something? Lol. I liked the action and comedy along with the great acting and script to the movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It took my daughter and I to do it together. She's 9. It's a great thinking game for kids and adults to pass the time doing something productive. Caution the first two hints can be obvious but wait until the last hint that's when you get the good stuff.<br /><br />I purchased this on my Kindle Fire, . I had no problems.<br /><br />Downside: I personally can do without the Satanic symbols. Developers please try not to include into game.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Best app ever. Works GREAT on my kindle fire, and was FREE! Easy to use, easy to progress, yet challenging when you evolve to further distance and better armored.
0345531957|4.0|This is vintage Grisham and that means it is an effortless page-turner. Nothing in the writing will disturb or challenge the reader but it is entertaining, clever, with plenty of twists and turns.<br /><br />It is an intelligent, slightly cold book, compelling despite the absence of any characters you'd want to root for.<br /><br />That the hero isn't especially likeable makes the dark ending easier to stomach.<br /><br />I would recommend this books to anybody looking for a well thought out thriller told in an efficient and uncomplicated style.
B008JFUPLC|5.0|I've never even seen Monsters Inc., but I don't think that detracted from this movie experience at all.<br /><br />I loved watching the zany competitions between the fraternities.  Tons of funny moments.<br /><br />Definitely recommend!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It is best game ever and I'm not exaggerating u can create planes jets zombies helicopters as much as  u can imagine it's so fun the story's kinda hard for kindle I don't know if iPad or iPod versions the same say a review and let.me know once u get this u won't want to get off I recommend u get this app.
B008JFUQ16|1.0|In my opinion, this one is just terrible.  While there are a few quirky, funny  moments, the rest of the movie was a snore fest.<br /><br />There really is no plot to this one.  Everything funnels down to how Gru meets his wife.  Big deal.<br /><br />Better effort seen elsewhere, I say skip this one.  blah
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This is just Great!!<br />Have recommended this to many friends.<br />Now i need a good price on Spartacus:War of the Dammed
B00C2GJWNG|5.0|Quirky, interesting and original music. There is a mesmerizing and pleasant lyrical wisdom to his vocal delivery and songwriting. This guy has the charisma to raise the singer-songwriter to a new level.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|The plot was alright. Twists at the end of the book were random and out of nowhere.<br /><br /> Really liked the characters!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love the color it stands out so it is easy to find where ever I left it. Love it
0670026557|5.0|I had the good fortune to experience Adam Grant's evangelic presentation about reciprocal giving at Penn last year, and the book was a terrific follow-up.  I loved the stories of giving that resulted in eventual payback - when the giving was for the right reasons and came from the heart, as well as the cautionary tales about people who overextended themselves repeatedly to the wrong people and paid the price.  All giving is not created equal and you need to know when and how to dose it.
B0085CXVOC|3.0|Brain candy action flick. Not as imaginative or clever as the Indiana Jones movies, and no real surprises; but, sometimes that is just the movie you are looking for. Nice that the violence left something to your imagination and the interaction between Penélope Cruz and Matthew McConaughey was way more mellow and well done than I expected.
1885167776|5.0|The author, Gary Keller, has built an empire in real estate with something like 80,000 agents. His company has a list of business awards that requires considerable scrolling to get through.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line Gary Keller got interested in instructional and inspirational business books. Hugely successful people sometimes choose this route because they want to influence the world.<br /><br />I found that the book lays out a lot of truths about purpose and increasing one's results at what matters. There are famous quotes and logic breakdowns that remind the reader how illogical most of us can be. Mostly we all want something better but we're not focused like Keller.<br /><br />Interestingly, Keller made a lot of mistakes early in his career and he bounced back big. The things he's telling us to do are what he learned to do. And I think he's correct. That's why I think this is a 5-star book, because Keller is correct.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is a life saver for those who don't monitor their battery life every 10 minutes. Its U.I. is extremely fluid and easy to adapt to. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone looking for a battery monitoring app due to its simplicity and customizability. 5 out of 5
B0026RHR6K|3.0|like everyone else here, i love BSG, and so i bought the DVD collectible Cylon version. the packaging of the dvds leave a lot to be desired. i mean, i like the setup and everything. but, the cardboard sleeves to store the dvds? eh... already i found scratches on the first disc of season one.<br /><br />while i love the series, i don't recommend this box set. if anything get the gray DVD box set or for the Blu-Ray set, at least they're sold in their respect seasons (plus you get the plan movie in the blu-ray box set).<br /><br />the show is also on Netflix, but if your like me and have streaming issues, get either the DVD gray box or Blu-Ray.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|A nifty little tool to transfer pics to the IPad.  It works like a charm either from the camera or a memory chip.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Kiss has been receiving tons of hatemail for continuing on with the make up and the use of the characters created by Ace Frehley and Peter Criss.I for one don't hate it,but I look at it differently.First off I've been a fan for almost 30 years and have only seen them with the original lineup(every tour from reunion to the \\"farewell tour\\".)Each time was a great show but musically it was definetly lacking.I then went and seen them on the alive 35 tour(sonic boom) tour and was blown away...the tightest musicianship i have ever witnessed at a kiss concert since watching live video from the revenge tour...fast forward to Monster.Now while Sonic Boom was an attempt to channel classic KISS and did so successfully this album switches the vibe to an old 70`s rock vibe that is more of a tribute to old school classic rock than it is an attempt to redo another kiss album...I like alot of the songs,but the ones that blew me away were all the paul stanley cuts..Hell or hallellujah is great and all,but the groovey shout mercy blew away at first listen.The one song that has been my favorite of the album and I consider a Kiss Klassic is long way down.Lyrically and musically the song has it all.The rest of the album is very good to a few tracks mainly two,being decent.There arent any poor tracks and its a meat and potatoes rock n roll album that is riff heavy with good drumming and nice soloing throughout the album.I like to listen to this album after Revenge as i think they complement eachother well...highly recommended.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|In an attempt to avoid spoilers I'll keep this review brief. Max Brooks is excellent at taking a &#34;what if?&#34; scenario, and logically, thoroughly, and sometimes humorously thinking through it. Everything from &#34;How could a zombie infestation reach global pandemic levels?&#34;, &#34;How could modern military fail?&#34;, &#34;How would we survive? Where would we go?&#34;....all answered, sometimes with enough heart it moved me. The visual quality to Max Brook's work really goes far in painting a picture of scenarios and events. This book came alive as I read it, and that's a sign of a great piece of writing.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|I ADORE this CD! The music is hip, mixing old '20's songs with the same lyrics and updated music!<br />Like the current film, Baz Luhrmann has done an extraordinary job of fusing the 1920's decadence with the culture of excess of today.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love the new puzzles but find it very difficult now that the pieces are snapping to a grid instead of being smooth when moving. Also the puzzles are not formatting to the entire screen it adds a black border which makes the pieces smaller. Another thing the border does not lock into place. Was building a puzzle and the border rotates and goes off screen by barely touching it. Is there a way to download the previous format? The new puzzles were a wonderful update but the changes to the movement of the pieces make the puzzles a little frustrating.
1616550414|5.0|Fast shipping and item as described. As a long time LoZ fan I was ecstatic to read through this and look at all the back story and concept art for each of the games. Would definitely recommend!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I showed this mouse to my gaming friends and they all laughed at me with their boring other gaming mice from flashy name brands, because they've never heard of Anker.  Now, they're crying and begging for me to let them be my friend again.<br /><br />Also this mouse is really great, fits perfectly to my hand.  I think I still need to work out the weight but whatever, still functions and is great.<br /><br />Only two problems I've encountered:<br />1.  The only thing that changes color is the Anker logo on the mouse back.  The scroll wheel and DPI light do not change color from blue.  Not sure if this is a malfunction with my mouse specifically or if it's just how it is.  Not really a big problem for me, I don't care honestly.<br />2.  There are only two profile modes for button mapping.  Again, not really a big problem for me as I'm still getting used to using all the extra buttons on my mouse, but it'd be nice if the software let me have more than two profiles for button mapping/color.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|as a surprise to me, it was very mellow, a good CD to listen to when winding down, relaxing or even background music for studying.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Great DVD!  Amazing videography shows you some of the most unique creatures in the world.  Definitely love David Attenborough as the narrator.  He is legit.  I really love the &#34;journals&#34; portion at the end of each episode that shows what the camera crew had to go through to get the awesome videos.  Must see for anyone who is at all curious about nature/life, etc. even if you aren't exactly a science nerd.
B003SR3392|5.0|The creators and the cast are amazing! This is such a different tv show than most and I LOVE that! I would recommend this show to everyone.
B0090XO57C|5.0|I love these DVDs, they are an awesome gift not just for nature lovers, but anyone who is curious about the world or just appreciates amazing nature pictures/videos.  David Attenborough is a great narrator.  I've never seen the version narrated by Oprah, but I have heard that it is not nearly as good, and I don't think I could watch it after listening to David.  The behind the scene footage is also really cool.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We need to have more shows like this on television.  From the first season to the third you see the subtle change happening between the classes.  There are lessons there.

B000HC2LI0|2.0|The picture  quality of this box set was great. The sound quality was mediocre. The production consistency was poor at best because  first  off after season 5 there were no more sub titles making the poor quality sound even more confusing (background noise made dialogue difficult to understand along with the too rapid fire delivery), and second off  4 of the last seasons final cd's skipped, stalled, or froze up completely. Would have loved to have the set with these things corrected. Sent it back.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|There was no story development. They relied heavily on the love scenes and they became boring.  The non-ending was unprofessional. I won't be continuing with this series.  It's a shame because I loved the first two books so much.
B00APYKXFS|4.0|I see a lot of negative reviews for this app by people who are apparently terrible at videogames.  Don't trust those reviews.  As an example, I see people complaining that your hand covers the ship while playing - ten seconds of experimentation shows that you can control your ship from anywhere, including the border around the screen.  As for things being hard to see, well, it's a bullet hell shmup, that's par for the genre.<br /><br />The only real problem is that the music is completely uninspired, but frankly I play mobile apps with the sound muted anyways.

B0054XOMX4|4.0|Phantom Orion is one of the best beys around. It has a bearing drive with a free-spinning tip and a fusionwheel with a plastic disk in the center. That makes it's defenses almost unbreakable but here is a way to beat it. What you do is when you launch in a beyblade launch it sideways towards so the bey aim for and hit the plastic disk in the center of the fusionwheel on the bottom because that is where orion's defenses are weak. That stratagy will work with any bey unless it has a wide-defense (Twisted Tempo's in general) preformance tip. Otherwise I reccomend this beyblade to bladers that are NOT attack-oriented. I rate it four stars.

B00992CF6W|3.0|For a more reasonable price, you can get a game like mcpe but with a lot more features such as riding horses and electricity (kinda like redstone). The only bad thing about Survivalcraft that mcpe has is multiplayer. But, in my opinion, multiplayer is not worth a couple bucks considering the fact that mcpe multiplayer is local only. So get Survivalcraft instead.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|has done himself proud. He's sixty-eight years old and his oldest child is fifty and his youngest is two. None of his years have been wasted as reflected by this very fine CD. It isn't \\"Maggie May\\". And, it isn't \\"Street Fighting Man\\". And, it isn't a lot of other things that he can rightfully be proud of from his past. This CD is a vehicle for a mature singer to showcase some of his very best work ever. Before hearing this record, \\"The First Cut is The Deepest\\" was my favorite Rod Stewart song. It's my second favorite now,  behind his best song ever, \\"Brighton Beach\\". Buy it on CD and listen to it in front of good speakers in a good room. You won't be disappointed and the currently meaningless and misleading term \\"CD quality\\" will once again have moment.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I absolutely love the Expendables 1 & 2!!  Whoever came up with the idea of putting together a bunch of 80's and a few current action hero's was awesome!  This movie has all the over the top action you expect, plus lots of humor, and a good story line.  Who doesn't love it when good triumphs over evil?!  The thing I really love about both of these movies is that they actually rely on acting a good story line and not a bunch of foul language and sex.  Trust me, you won't miss it!  I think the funniest part of the whole movie is seeing Willis and Arnie squeeze into a smart car and shoot it out!!  You will love this!

B006UG90RM|4.0|I've come to realize how good of a job Ted Templeman did as Van Halen's engineer.  The Warner Bros demo and Gene Simmon's demo contain the same songs and riffs that made it on the first 6 VH albums (and this one), but they don't sound nearly as good.  A Different Kind of Truth reminds me more of the Warner Bros demo than Templeman's VH albums.  You can realize how great each song is (and there are some great kick-ass songs here - As Is being the wildest), but the mix sucks.  Everything's muddy and in the middle.  Eddie's tone is good but it's hard to pick out what he's doing.  Also I sure miss Michael Anthony's kicked-in-the-nuts backup singing.  Oh well.

1455502758|5.0|I read this book 15 months after my mother passed away from cancer (four months after Hitchens). My mom's death has truly shaken my universe and as an atheist living in the Bible Belt it is not easy to find people to talk honestly with about my confusion and search for meaning in life.  Thank you Christopher Hitchens for not answering questions but at least letting me hear someone else asking the same questions without turning to supernatural for answers.
1781162646|4.0|I was expecting the usual eerie, creepy type of story by Mr. King, but I was surprised. I enjoyed this book very much...murders, and yes some creepy moments. When I received it via UPS, I made myself comfortable and started reading.<br />I had a very hard time putting this book down, even though it was nearly 2 a.m. and I had to be up before the crack of dawn.<br />The setting took me back to my childhood in Upstate (central) New York, going to the annual carnival (although we called them &#34;field days&#34;) and how much fun it all was. The rides! The games! The scent of hot dogs and cotton candy! My favorite was, of course, the fun house and how it used to make scream, but all in good fun!<br />Mr. Kings descriptions of the fun house was wonderful, the characters were vivid and likable, except for the usual jackasses, but even the hard to like characters were great!<br />All in all, I would recommend this book, and in fact, gave it to my &#34;sister&#34; to read...she devoured it faster than I did.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The girl who 'went' was just such an interesting character. I'd say more for fear of spoilers. I stayed up really late reading it. I thought the characters were really well developed and original, and the plot was engrossing.
0131103628|1.0|I had high hopes for this book after reading all the glowing reviews, but unfortunately, in reading it I was reminded of so many of my college professors:  brilliant in their field yet stunted in their ability to convey key concepts to the student.  Unless you already know programming well, don't bother buying this book as anything other than an occasional reference.  Students of C are much better served by Kochan's 3rd or 4th edition on the language.

B00BEOYPKW|3.0|I really wanted to like this album, it seems to have all the right<br />moves, decent voice, decent guitar work, mellow 70s vibe recalling a more<br />relaxed Velvet Underground + Dylan +perhaps Jackson Brown. With all the<br />5* reviews I thought why not give it a try? The first song (circa 10 minutes)<br />seemed pleasant enough at the beginning but by the 150th \\"yeah yeah,<br />yeah yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah\\" I had to hit the fast-forward by song 3 the pace<br />and intensity finally elevated a hair but by the end of that 7+ minute song<br />I again wanted to hit the fast forward. You can call this \\"stoner rock\\" if<br />you like but I call it \\"ennui rock\\" it sounds good if you really don't listen<br />to the trite-ish lyrics and the same 2-3 chord changes over & over. I have yet<br />to finish this CD and I doubt I ever will. If this is 5* music then Richard<br />Thompson and other of my favorite guitar slinging singer songwriters must be 8* music. How did Paul Simon put it, One man's ceiling is another man's floor\\"?<br />Perhaps if KV shortened his songs a tad and/or took a few more chances musically<br />and read some real poetry for lyrical inspiration his music would be worthy of<br />5*s. Sorry if you find this offensive but that is my take on this--file under<br />easy listening-snooze rock.
0679805273|5.0|I purchased this book as a graduation gift for my niece. Here is what she has to say about it: &#34;This was an adorable read!

B000025SL5|5.0|I have loved listening to Vangelis since his score for &#34;Blade Runner&#34;.  The score for &#34;1492-Conquest of Paradise&#34; demonstrates the diversity and creativity of Vangelis as a musician.  Although his music is &#34;Electronic&#34;, one can easily imagine this score being played by a philharmonic orchestra. The music is sweeping and majestic yet not occlusive.  I listen to this CD at least once a week as part of a meditative relaxation.

B00BC0JI6O|5.0|I was turned on to Spock's Beard while speaking to a fellow Yes concert attendee during intermission.  I was not even aware that decent progressive rock was still being recorded until he told me about Spock's Beard and Glass Hammer.  I listened to this album several times at first and liked it more and more with each listen.  The fabulous musicianship is on par with some of the best jazz artists, (which are what I usually listen to) and the arrangements are excellent.  If I have anything negative to say about this album it would be that some of the tunes border on commercial-sounding catchy.  On the other hand, it those help to introduce more people to Spock's Beard, I approve heartily!

0812973992|4.0|The optimism of Colum McCann's novel begins in the title, reminding us that the world is much more than our individual lives and its ceaseless spinning is as likely to deliver joy as it is to deliver sorrow. The story is mostly set in New York City in August 1974 when Phillipe Petit strung a wire between the towers of the World Trade Center and mesmerized much of the city 110 stories below. At that time the city was at its low point -- decrepit, bankrupt, crime-ridden -- and much of the action takes place in a Bronx Housing project where an Irish monk named Corrigan has opened his apartment to the hookers who ply their trade under the Deegan Expressay and fallen in love with a Guatemalan nurse who is the widow of a death squad officer. The monk's brother, Ciaran, arrives from Ireland and is appalled by but also drawn to two of the streetwalkers, Tillie and her 17-year-old daughter, Jazmin, who has toddler twins of her own. Across the river in Manhattan is Claire, wife of a judge and bereaved mother of a son lost in Vietnam, who has found some solace for her grief by getting to know other women whose sons died in southeast Asia. And there is Lara, a daughter of privilege and artist, who left behind drugs and alcohol when she escaped the city a year earlier but disastrously falls right back in on her first return to the city. As Petit dances across his wire, the lives of these characters collide in a tragedy, but the great world spins on, and ultimately delivers the survivors to redemption and joy.
1401324649|5.0|I don't know how I missed The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared when it was first released, but I'm so glad I found it now.<br /><br />Alan Karisson is the 100-year-old man who decides that he really doesn't want to go to his 100th birthday party.  So, he climbs out his window, in search of freedom and vodka.  Especially vodka.<br /><br />His adventure begins at the bus station, with a suitcase filled with cash..and some criminals...and a few more odd characters thrown in.<br /><br />But as his current adventure is unfolding, we are also introduced to his wild adventures as a young man.  Adventures that include:  Churchill, Mao tse Tung, Stalin, Truman...just to name a few.<br /><br />This is a wonderful tall-tale adventure made all the more entertaining by the dry sense of humor that permeates the book.<br /><br />\\"Herbert blushed, while dismissing the praise, saying that it wasn't hard to play stupid when you are stupid.  Allan said that he didn't know how hard it was, because the idiots Allan had met so far in his life had all tried to do the opposite.\\"<br /><br />Now, I admit the book did seem to go on and on, but I never lost interest and was entertained from beginning to end.  Truly delightful.
0316154687|3.0|Few writers make me laugh out loud, but Sedaris is one of them. Generally, that happens when he surprises me with one of his uniquely bent insights or generalizations. He'll have explained some aspect of his wacky family, which is diverting in itself, but it's the life lessons he draws that deliver the yucks. This book includes many of his familiar bits -- his childhood, his homes in France, his travels -- but lacks an overriding theme that would benefit from a front-to-back read. For that reason, this is the perfect bed table book to dip into now and then when you're short of time or between books.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I did not know what to expect but I was happy to find this a fun and cute movie. The computer graphics are super. I'm telling all my friends to watch it.  Johnny Depp is great at voicing the lead character, and what a character he is!
0307472841|2.0|As a crime novel, this book is a real stinker. Mankell apparently intends it as a fictional polemic and employs a Scandinavian variation on the Hollywood stereotype of the \\"wily Chinese.\\" As fiction and as politics, the book fails to persuade. The story opens with a terrible crime -- the slaughter and dismemberment of 19 people in a tiny and remote village in northern Sweden. The central character is Judge Birgitta Roslin, who realizes that her mother grew up in the village as the foster daughter of two of the victims. Ordered by her doctor to take time off from work and unhappy with the estrangement in her longtime marriage, Roslin heads north and tries to insinuate herself into the investigation, embarking on an investigation of her own that seems to show connections to a recent visitor from Chinese and a recent slasher murder of a family in Nevada. Roslin goes so far as to break into the crime scene and steal some letters and diaries from a desk drawer. SPOILER ALERT. The next part of the novel is a diary written by a Chinese man about his experiences as a peasant in the 1850s who was tricked into indentured servitude in Canton, transported to work on the railroad in the U. S., endured torture at the hands of a brutal Swedish overseer, and eventually made his way back to China with the help of two Swedish missionaries who ultimately betrayed him as well. The diary is now in the hands of his modern-day descendant, one of the new Chinese billionaires who is bent on revenge. Back in Sweden, Judge Roslin is still on the case, despite the fact that the police have arrested a man who confessed to the murders before killing himself in jail. Among her clues is a photograph of a Chinese guest taken from a hotel surveillance camera and a Chinese magazine bearing the handwritten address of a Beijing hotel, both of which she carries with her to Beijing when she fortuitously joins an old school chum on a trip to China. While the judge's pal is occupied with a conference on Chinese history, Roslin goes off in search of the man in her photograph and winds up mugged, with her purse stolen and hotel room searched. Who should ride to the rescue but the sister of the Chinese billionaire, a party functionary who is greatly disturbed by rebirth of a new mandarin class of capitalists. After sending Judge Roslin back to Sweden, sister and brother both travel to Africa as part of an official delegation, and sister is disturbed to learn that her brother and Chinese authorities have hatched a plan to relocate millions of Chinese peasants to Africa, billing what she sees as simple colonialism as redevelopment aid. In Africa, the brother arranges an accident that kills his sister and the bodyguard responsible for the killings in Nevada and Sweden. But before her death, his sister entrusted a letter to a friend which detailed her worries, and so when the action moves back to Sweden, Judge Roslin finds herself approached by a mysterious Chinese woman from London who warns that her life might be in danger. When Roslin learns that the Chinese man has returned to the remote village, she heads for London, where the evil billionaire from Beijing is killed with a rifle shot to the head through the window of a London hotel just as he's about the lace her breakfast coffee with ground glass. The shooter is the son of the dead sister who has obtained revenge for the murder of his mother. The biggest problem with this story is the wooden characters who mouth all the correct attitudes of liberal Western concern for the poor and dispossessed of the world but lack flesh, blood, and beating hearts. Judge Roslin and her friend were pro-Mao radicals in the 1960s but have nothing interesting to say about who they were then or how they found China now. The Chinese billionaire risks everything to avenge long-dead ancestors by slaughtering people several generations removed from the brutal overseer but Mankell fails to show the visceral emotions which would animate such a reprisal. The book fails as a whodunit, simply telling us the culprit. And the book fails as a polemic, tossing off a bunch of ominous predictions about China's plans for Africa without providing any concrete evidence. It takes a talented writer to pull off a genre-bender, and Mankell clearly is not up to the task.eprisal. The book fails as a whodunit, simply telling us the culprit.

1439153663|2.0|The Kitchen House is a first novel, and many of the problems with this book stem from that fact. Kathleen Grissom has a great idea for a story but lacks the skill to execute it well. Her protagonist is seven years old at the start of the novel, an immigrant Irish girl who finds herself an indentured servant living among the black slaves on a backwoods Virginia plantation. To allow both Lavinia and the reader to learn essential backstory, Grissom adopts a novice author's desperate move: having characters who have been intimately familiar with the backstory for years discuss it -- \\"You'll recall, Papa, that Bessie is the illegitimate daughter of the master and his favorite slave woman,\\" \\"Of course, Mama, but you'll remember the missus thinks Bessie is master's lover, not his daughter,\\" \\"And don't forget, Papa, that the young master -- Bessie's half brother -- thinks the same way.\\" Another weakness of the storytelling is Grissom's reluctance to let the novel unfold in showing scenes, preferring telling summaries of events that happen off the page. In addition, there are simply too many characters -- instead of one slave girl the same age as Lavinia, Grissom gives us twins, plus another slave a few years younger and yet another a few years older. Having too many characters dilutes the reader's interest and emotional investment. Finally, Grissom's characters are too often caricatures -- the evil overseer, the ne'er-do-well heir, the neurotic lady of the manner -- and the plot is littered with lurid pot-boilers but the writing lacks the historical verisimilitude that makes for compelling historical fiction.

B005G02RIC|1.0|I highly anticipated this version of Tosca.  I am a Callas aficionado and put aside any expectation of seeing a performance like her's on this blu-ray.  I had to settle for Callas' recordings and a poor quality Covet Garden 2nd Act on DVD.  Which I would pay five times the cost of that poor quality in comparison to this train wreck.  This tenor of little note only makes his acting and vocal choices even more ridiculous than any on film.  Raimondi-I expected 100%! More than you even put into your vocal and acting choices<br />ad more expectations of himself.  HE SOLD HIMSELF TO THE DEVIL JUST TO GET A PAYCHECK.  In reviewing this by just listening we have so many questionable tempo and embellishments than Maestro Puccini wrote - yes this is why Callas relearned the role when performing it new.  The soprano was a audio and even worse of a train wreck visually. Her performance had none of Tosca's subtle interactions with her Cavaradossi and with Scarpia it was a train wreck in action from the minute she came into the church.  By now you know I hold this blu-ray as a sham.  AMAZON RETURN MY MONEY!<br /><br />I come from a position of knowledge in this having been a trained musician and conductor,finally Artistic Director.  Now opera afficianodos must judge this on their own, but listen to me, watch a Zefferelli production filmed on location and so much more intelligent acting and vocals are self evident.  Zubin Mehta only know fffortisimo as a volume.  He brings poor choices to the podium and overall interprets Puccini through clouded eyes (and ears).  This was not a film made in India but certainly seemed to adapt the overproduced products that we see.  Look at the sopranos cringed face throughout and that says everything.  That  is why we Italians threw our lunches at performers.<br /><br />AMAZON GIVE ME A REFUND NOW!!!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I didn't give this book 5 stars only because it did take me a couple of chapters before I truly got interested in it. However, by the 3rd chapter, I was hooked. Hosseini does such a superb job weaving stories and characters, I truly love his novels. This one was no exception.
0375869026|4.0|Juvenile fiction is not what I tend to read, but I heard such great things about RJ Palacio's Wonder, I thought I should read it.  Wonder is a heart warming, heart wrenching, laugh out loud, and maybe even do a little crying book.  It's a book that every parent should read and discuss with their child.  It teaches kindness, compassion, understanding, and acceptance.  It also shows kids being bullied by others and how they handle it.<br /><br />Wonder is unique in that RJ Palacio tells the story of August (Auggie) Pullman from various points of view.  The story is revealed through Auggie and other children in his 5th grade class as well as his sister Olivia (Via) and a couple of her friends.  Not only does the reader get to know Auggie through the other characters points of view, but we also get to know them.<br /><br />Palacio has done a really good job of letting the reader know whose point of view she's presenting.  Granted when she changes a point of view she tells the reader who is speaking. However we know Justin is speaking because he refers to Auggie's parents as \\"the dad\\" and \\"the mother\\" and he doesn't use any capitalization; which threw me off and I stalled a bit. The reader knows it's Jack's point of view because he uses 'like' a lot and I mean a lot.  Summer mentions practically everyone by using their first and last name.  I didn't like that the reader only heard from the children's point of view.  It would have been nice to give the reader a separate adult point of view.  The reader gets a more visceral reaction too Auggie from the other kids, but we really don't get a full reaction of how the adults reacted to Auggie's face.  The only thing we get is when Auggie tells the reader about Ms. Petosa's initial reaction to him,<br /><br />She had only hesitated for a millionth of a second, but I could tell the moment she saw me (Wonder 38).<br /><br />One fatal flaw I felt Wonder had is that every child had something going on.  Summer's father was killed ina war.  Jack doesn't have a lot of money and lives in a bad part of town.  Miranda's parents are getting divorced and her father is remarrying a younger woman who is pregnant and her mom no longer has time for her.  Via lives her life in her brother's shadow.  Justin's parents as he describes it:<br /><br />could hardly wait for me to be old enough to take care of myself 'you can go to the store by yourself.' 'here's the key to the apartment.' . . . what word do you use to describe parents who don't protect enough? underprotective? neglectful? self-involved? lame? all of the above. (Wonder 192)<br /><br />As a jaded adult reading a book slated for 8-12 year olds, I felt that the ending was a bit contrived and unrealistic as everything was tied up in a nice neat little bow.  Even so, it left me on a positive up beat note that it is possible to accept someone and be their friend even if they don't look like you.  And how differences can bring people together.<br /><br />Do all the good you can,<br />By all the means you can,<br />In all the ways you can,<br />In all the places you can,<br />At all the times you can,<br />To all the people you can,<br />As long as you ever can.<br />~~John Wesley's Rule (Wonder 312)
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|It doesn't give you many options to style hair.It'd be better if it had like scruntchies or hair clips or curling irons.I am not impressed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really cool. non horse people will also love it.it teaches you about horses and how to take<br /> care of them.soooo I would say get this app.
B001D07Q9E|1.0|THE COMPANY (based in NC) SENT ME A DVD THAT WILL NOT PLAY IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS CONSIDERED REGION 1. THEY SENT ME A DVD FOR REGION 2 (where ever that is???).!!!!!<br />THEY WILL NOT PAY FOR RETURN POSTAGE, BUT I AM GOING TO SEND BACK AND ASK THAT THEY REPLACE THE DVD WITH ONE THAT WILL ACTUALLY PLAY IN THIS COUNTRY.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really do like this app. Nice to know what is up with the weather at all times so easier to make any plans.
B00AEBB86A|5.0|I first viewed this movie on my Prime account. It was so good I had to purchase the DVD.  The writing and action is without a doubt, superb. I knew within 20 minutes that I would enjoy this movie time and time again. Anytime a writer can leave me panting in anticipation for the next scene, it's a &#34;WINNER&#34;.  Usually, I can predict what will happen while following along each scene, but I must say, I was fooled. My Thanks to the writer.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very nice to have when needed, any one would use it if had this app. So many times I with I had a calculator & now I do.
B00D1HC8VS|5.0|The new and improved recordings were awesome-you can hear every instrument on a good sound system.  My only complaint is that the packaging was somewhat flimsy and the notes about the album were skimpy too.  Other than that, I was extremely pleased with my purchase.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great for people who might not have a deck of cards, lol. I do really enjoy this having this app.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I would have rated Andrea Bocelli 50 stars if the rating scale went that high.  His crossover classic pop is beautiful....<br />His interpretation of each song is so pure that it sends your senses reeling.  I have all of his records and two of his<br />PBS DVD specials and to me they are priceless.  If we could encourage our youth to listen to his music, I am very<br />sure it would elevate their enjoyment of a finer musical venue and they would realize how tuneless, barren and simply nonsensical most of<br />the music they play is.  I would even go so far as to say there would be less crime in this world if there was less<br />rap, hip hop, and heavy metal music and more of Andrea Bocelli.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|This book puts into words something I hadn't previously understood. It gives language for understanding takers and my own level of comfort (or not) with direct orders.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|worthless game. totally devoid of worth!!! I downloaded it for free then immediately uninstalled after 2 rounds. sloppy controls and your hand blocks what you need to see to play.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a great app to occupy yourself especially if you are bored. careful though it can be an addicting game. I recommend it to anyone.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Id recomend this film to everyone, its fun and awesome 3D entertainment to have at home. Great quality as well.
B004132I20|5.0|Holmes and Watson strike again in a contemporary and somewhat dark setting.  Cumberbatch is an intriguing Sherlock, almost Aspergers-like. Watson saves Holmes _____ at the end in the first two episodes anyway.  Obsessions don't always pay off.
B00B769XB8|5.0|Its a really entertaining action loaded film, great special effects and a little scarry too. Really enjoyed watching this one
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I can't get enough of searching these rooms for items to help me escape!  I could play all day long.  Love this game!!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|A typical jack teacher novel with lots of action and many twists and turns to keep you guessing.<br />Highly recommended.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Beautifully done  .grabs you and does not let go. I think I will read more from the brontes' .  great read
B006LSZECO|4.0|A thorough and compelling look into the evil that is possible, Gone Girl chills the reader because evil so completely trumps the good, the normal, the average.  Hopefully, the amazingly evil Amy exists only in the abstract, and the rest of us normal Nicks will never have to deal with or be turned by such close acquaintance with pure, unadulterated evil.  We've heard from The Book that the Evil One can put on a very attractive countenance. Be wary!  Read this book as a cautionary tale!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game. Hope more levels come out soon. Keeps your mind occupied and not that hard to play but still keeps you guessing.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is one of the coolest noise generators I have seen.  The app presents you with several screens of possible sound effects to choose from.  You tap one of the icons to enable the sound and its individual volume.  You can then flip through all the sounds and continue tapping new ones to add additional sounds to the samples already playing.  The ability to create an insane amount of custom sounds is outstanding.  You can even create a timer and have the app shutdown or stop playing after a set amount of time.  Totally worth the money.  I let my kids pick the sound effects they want to heat for nap time and they get real quiet so they can listen.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This movie lives up to all the media hype.  It is a wonderful story--didn't know allot of the historic details revealed.  It is well-acted and I recommend it highly.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|This is a challenging game and I'm not sure why people are complaining about the camera. it works fine, and is easy to use. it can get a little confusing once you make a big stack but I belive its part of the game. I look forward to playing this game when bored or looking for a good puzzle game to play.
B003DRWX9I|5.0|Great to hear slash doing what he was meant to do. Great tracks, great selection of lyricist on the album.
B00CEF014E|5.0|\\"Solstice\\" is sort of an unusual book.  I've never read anything quite like it.  It starts off in a psychiatric hospital, then goes to a roadside motel, and then to this -- I-don't-know-what-to-call-it -- WEIRD community in northern Oklahoma.  There are a lot of twists and turns that are organic enough, growing in cool ways from what came before.  I wanted to see more of the locals and the Rainbow cult, though.  Also, I didn't really get Clive Cole's whole backstory.  But the pacing was great.  I was never bored, and like I said, the plot twists worked well.<br /><br />\\"Solstice\\" is a tight read with very few wasted words.  If this is Book #1 in a series, I'm lookin' forward to Book #2!!
B00BNR6RH4|5.0|I have this LP in mint shape from 1976. I wanted the 180 gram new release also.  The sound isn't that different between the two albums and I have a good turntable and receiver to play all my vinyl on.  McCartney, Laine, Linda, Jimmy,and Joe made a very good concert to hear and see.  Wanted to mention Denny Laine, great guitar and bass player also, with Paul for years.  The cd from twenty years ago didn't sound well, I have that cd.  These records played on a good turntable sound very good.  This package looks the same as the one from 1976. Two of the three records fit in one side of the album.  Nothing new is added. The poster is like the original and the three 180 gram records sound clear no scratches or skips. These are very good records. Made in Germany, no problems like The Beatles Lp releases in 2012.  It also comes with a free download card.  Anything played on a cheap player will sound bad no mater what kind of remastering. This is the best Paul McCartney and Wings live show. Vinyl is best for me, I can make my own cd of it if I want. Paid about 32.00 new on Amazon.
B0000CC5CS|5.0|I really wanted this movie to complete my Terminator collection of Terminator flicks.  It is very good, I enjoyed all of them.
075669812X|4.0|I bought my 5-year old nephew a few gifts for Christmas but apparently this was his favorite item.  He looks at it often and it makes many car trips with him.  I've been told this was a super gift!
B001HN6922|5.0|These guys always bring so much to their animated movies, their content and story lines are great, it is so fun to watch over and over.
1558908382|5.0|This movie is awesome.  The DVD came in great condition and we've already enjoyed viewing it.  I didn't think I'd easily be able to find such an old movie on DVD but Amazon came through!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is like smoking crack, or so I hear. Once you start you can not stop! Oh the wasted hours...
B007SGM084|5.0|I read it three times and I might read it again.  I loved this trilogy but I am dying to read it from Christian's perspective.  I'd pre-buy that in a heartbeat!  I've tried to read several other recommended books in the same genre but they don't measure up.  Poor character development, weak plots etc...
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't think of a way to describe this that would do justice to it. It is Just that good.
B003ZYU3T6|5.0|This is the Modern Times Chaplin lovers deserve. The presentation is magnificent. I hope Criterion completes the Chaplin catologue. The genius of the man is on display to the fullest in this delightful disc.<br />Warren  Brisbane Australia
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son told me to give the game 5 stars.He says it is an awesome game. He likes to be able to buy things.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Itbis always hard to like the new bond, but this movie lives up its reputation . You won't be disappointed.
B000J103PC|3.0|This movie was all right. I wanted to see Meryl Streep in a different role, I love her as an actress. Cute chick flick.
B006CHML4I|4.0|I bought this watch about a month ago. I purchased this watch since different companies I make service calls to  do not allow cell phones in certain areas so you end up losing track of time. (Its been years since I have worn a watch) So I found an old quartz watch and you guessed it it had stopped working. Tired of looking for and replacing batteries I decided to buy a Seiko Men's SNK807 Automatic.<br /><br />Its a nice small size compared to some of the monster watches out there. Small enough that you can work with it on getting into some tight spots and it does not get in the way. Also since it is analog I can tell the time without the need of my glasses. I cannot tell what time it is with a digital watch without having my glasses on.<br /><br />I have read reviews saying how not too worry about the accuracy the first week or two since the watch seems to have a break in period. Well that seems very true, I noticed the first week it would slow down and speed up buy 10 - 15 seconds a day.After a few weeks it was fast by about 10 seconds a day. So every week I would reset the time about a minute slow and in a weeks time it would be right on the money.<br /><br />After a months time I set my watch about a minute slow again and find that it has not gained or lost more than a few seconds per day! Its been about a week and it has keep its time within 10 seconds after a whole week! Amazing for this price point in a mechanical watch!<br /><br />It will be interesting to see what its like a month from now.<br /><br />So far its been great.
0307346617|4.0|I was ready to put it down after the first 80-90 pages.  Its not at all what I thought it would be.  If you think this is a riveting story, you are wrong.  Its a series of dispatches about the various episodes of the war, told 10 years after the victory over the zombies.  A friend that had read it before me told me to stick with it and it does pick up and once the reader &#34;gets into it&#34;, it becomes a very good read.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|nice toy to play with, makes a great play-set.......and looks good when set up out of box....fun for all ages
0062238868|5.0|Enjoyed the book, I read it shortly after Kyle's murder.  He was a true American warrior and this book does do him justice.  You are able to feel his humor, his patriotism, and his spirit through this book.  I highly recommend this book to anybody that is interested in the war in &#34;The Sandbox&#34;.
1567184855|5.0|This book is amazing.  offers perspective And insight as to why we are here on earth. And how we grow as souls.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|This Box set is completed, all movies in one presentation with a good package and extras include. Awesome!! I recommend
1848566980|5.0|Great compilation of the masterpieces of one of the fathers of the fantastic and sci-fi art. If you like this fantastic universe, this is your book.
B007UQRW62|5.0|This Box Set is nice, and includes an umbrella gift with small posters. Awesome!!!. It's categorized according to me like Casablanca Box Set
1599290642|5.0|I love this collection of books. I follow them since years and I learn a lot with it. The best quality edition for the best art.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|This was a short DVD, missing all the things that are extra.  No EXTRA items that I look for on the menu.  How the movie was made and so forth..  Not happy although the movie is fine..  Next time I am going to buy a used one.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|loved it the first time I saw it. Loved it again the next time. Did the mistake of not buying it. WIll have to now.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|The author keeps the words flowing so that the book keeps the readers attention till the very last word. This book is an awesome read that passes time so quickly not to mention it is so easy to read on a kindle
B001TW69J4|4.0|Tosin Abasi sure can play.  CAFO is a break-out hit that makes jaws drop and Justin Bieber fans run in panic.  (That's what a good drummer sounds like.)  There's a lot of jazzy playing in here too, if that's your bag.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is the genuine Tubemate youtube video download app that is the best their is for Android. In fact it is easier than using a computer to get a video in my opinion.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I love Lady Antebellum and their music.  It was a great collection of songs and I listen to it all the time.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is an excellent story teller and this book gives another insight into the difficult lives of Afghans. For some of my friends who have also read it, switching back and forth between families was confusing yet they were intertwined. I found it an excellent read.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|This movie is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Points are argued to death and the main subject pointless.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love that its never ending and that it it like one big spy mystery. You don't  have to use real money you could just save your diamonds for objects to purchase.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|it is so cute because you get to see all this little animals in diffrent paternes. and you have to flick the food into their mouth and when you clean them you have to shroub them and when you play with them you have to flick the play ball and they will hit it back at you and you have to what in tell the blue box in the corner is full.<br />Get this game because I think you will like this game.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Oh my god this is bad as hell! Best game in the world hands down! Download soon and you won't be disappointed!
0780622650|5.0|a must have for any LIS fan. Loved the cameos.
B004LROMWU|5.0|I always enjoy watching scifi on tv.  Some tv scifi is good and others are bad.  This series is good.  The acting is terrific.  I have always liked Noah Wylie from his er days but he has truly grown up into a fine actor.  The series has very good special effects.<br />The aliens are very real looking.  I like the family dynamics in the story, they really emphasis how important family is.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good game for killing time on a Sunday afternoon.  Easygoing and entertaining.<br />Not a major brain drain.  Better than most of these puzzle games.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|I am biased since I am a big fan of DM since the 80's.  The style has changed, they are not the young guys of the 80's.  Now is more electronic but I liked it.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Nelson DeMille creates a great story of a blend of American history; social class character development; and a great detective story.<br />Thoroughly enjoyed the mixture of these attributes and the blend with an outstanding detective story.
B000WP30CI|1.0|I read a book that referenced this movie - pretty cool how I could do a search and watch the movie described in the book.  What I got out of it was that Dylan behaves just as Justin Beiber does nowadays.  Yes he is a genius, no, he is not unique as far as handling fame.  Couldn't stand the smart ass kid and couldn't bring myself to continue watching.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The best game (other than minecraft) that my brother has recommended for me. Thank You Halfbrick Studios!!!! Even FruitNinja is fun.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Great price and a great holder for kindle fire esp when ur watchin videos or playing games or checking email
B006VZS1EA|5.0|I enjoy this movie it awesome. Will take it to work and watch again. And  might just pop it in my truck .
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|It is okay, but not a really good substitute for Minecraft. If you are looking for Minecraft, pay the cost.
B009O2XY12|1.0|I can't even pass a level because of the bubbles I'm GIVEN. I can't pass a level because of the game.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fruit Ninja is one of the greatest games you could play. The bombs make it very challenging to complete the &quot;WONDERS&quot; of the game.-<br />ANONYMOUS
B001IZGPJG|5.0|If you are an Enigma fan you should get it, I love it and all their music. The DVD is good and I did enjoy it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I personally think that this game is WAY and I mean WAY better than the 1st one. I also like the graphics. The Brave and Oz ones are also pretty addicting. -<br />ANONYMOUS
193700788X|2.0|I've enjoyed this series even before the True Blood Series that is based on these books came out. Harris has always been an accomplished, engaging - if not great - writer. Sookie was a fun character with a unique voice. Each book introduced new characters, a new mystery and was fast paced enough to make me want to finish it in a day or two. There's not much I can add to the points that have already been made by other reviewers - the last book was inconsistent with the already established universe, seemed sloppy and dashed together in a kind of \\"Sookie this is your life\\" way.<br /><br />I thought the ending was horrible. Harris has said that this was something that she has been planning for awhile, but it really didn't feel that way. It felt like she got about 1/2 way through the book and decided that she wanted Sookie to end up with Sam. How disappointing!<br /><br />I think that what separates great fiction from mediocre fiction is how authors can resolve (if they do) the conflicts between the major characters without falling back on easy cliches. Harris let Sookie choose a routine mediocre life over, well, greatness. Sookie could have accomplished all she wanted without having to settle for her friend who lives in behind the bar.<br /><br />I think a better ending would have been for Eric to have stayed with Sookie even as she aged. If Sookie stayed true to her desire not to be changed into a vamp, she would have gotten older and died eventually. Wouldn't it have been better for Eric's character to eschew the easy path of either dumping Sookie or turning her into a vampire? After all, her life is just a small portion of Eric's. If he had been devoted to her throughout her life, THAT would have been unexpected and would have shown how much he grew during the course of the series. When she eventually died (maybe of old age), he would have to have learned to grieve and move on.<br /><br />It just seemed like an easy, not very good ending. I think the readers deservedbetter than this from Ms. Harris, but, thanks for the rest of the series. I've really enjoyed it.
1597801585|5.0|This book was different than any sy-fy, futuristic novel I have ever read. Sometimes I had a little trouble keeping up with all the different people in the book- you have to pay close attention! but i really liked it. Am considering reading more from this author.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|fun and mindless. I wish there was accessable information on what things mean (like what XP actually does or what &quot;goals &quot; are unlocked.)
B0041OOJNU|5.0|The shakira album sale el sol is really good.This was her last album,which is poppy and rock at the same time.This album seems more grown up.My favorite songs on the album are sale el sol,loca,gordita and devocion.Its very spanish and going back to her roots.Shakira could give jennifer lopez a run for her money any day!The album reminds you of summer-which is the title of the album the setting sun.All shakira fans will like this.One of the best albums ive bought at amazon.
B003EI2EH2|2.0|Don't buy a kindle edition of this book-buy the book. It's too hard to read and follow via the kindle.
B00003CXBK|5.0|1of my old school favorites its full of action suspense filled and majestic creaters. and its fun for the whole family.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|My first Florench Welch album and loved it.  It delivered..  &#34;You Got the Love&#34;  says it all.  I rate it a Buy.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Obviously this is no literary masterpiece, the writing is not great, often very mind numbingly repetitive, and zero character development ... BUT it's a fun read, I found myself giggling throughout the book.  If you are looking for a a fantasy romance book, ie as far from reality as you can get to real life romance, this is the book for you.
B003PDQEBS|5.0|This film is hauntingly magnetic and compelling. The use of silence to convey loss and emptiness is starkly contracted by Ford's style to jolt the viewer into what should be a celebrated era of fashion, music and iconography. But the tragic loss of a loved one is what purveys.<br /><br />Colin Firth is just extraordinary. The scene when he learns of his lovers demise is a reflection of a real emotional response and doesn't feel 'acted' at all. I have to say that I cried.
B003GK21U8|5.0|one of his best books i have read, cant wait for his next book.<br /><br />He certainly knows how to keep the suspense alive.
B0092C2X7U|4.0|I think the app is cool if you like little mini games. You get to backflip off of things and you get different costumes and stuff. This game is good for like Tween boys. (Ages 10-12) My little brother loves it.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I'm not going to bore any of the readers with the plot of the movie. We all know that it's a great story. I purchased this DVD for the 3-D version and i'm extremely satisfied with it. Don't look for &#34;stuff&#34; to come jumping out at you if you view it in 3-D. The 3-D version gives the viewer the perspective of depth that makes the animated dinosaurs and their environment look like you are their in the middle of the action.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's an awesome app. I reccommend it to anyone. It helps me stay in the word. You are able to highlight scriptures, take notes, and they also give you reading plans. For example, say you have a problem with Anger. They have a 5-7 day reading plan that shows you scriptures about why it is wrong to be angry and how to deal with your anger. Fantastic app.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|For those readers who liked Tim Burton's &#34;Big Fish&#34;, you all will really like Life of Pi&#34;. I bought this DVD for the story and for the amazing 3-D effects. If you own a 3-D flat screen TV, you should have this disc in your collection.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|It is a fun game that gave you challenges,and a really addictive game to play because you trying to figure out what drops. That's what I love about the game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait for the next Room. This game reminds me of Myst. The graphics were well rendered and the puzzles were fun.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Kept me thoroughly entertained. I liked that it provided clues or I would have lost interest after being stumped the first time. Can't wait for additional  rooms!!!!!!
B004LM72ZY|5.0|this is a huge hit for my son.  he loves his rocket ship. he says he is the little figure inside the rocketship.  Playmobil 123 is durable fun battery-free and timeless.
B007O40PN2|4.0|In any way that one looks at it, Hans Rott's symphony is a student work.  Perhaps it is one that presages the potential of a first-rate composer.  It does have many fine and interesting passages.  But this symphony is not one to build a legend on, nor even a hopeful promise.  When this work was rediscovered in the sluggish, overly reverent recording by Samuel, the firestorm was based on passages in the third movement that were seemingly cribbed by an admiring Mahler in his first symphony.  Having now heard Paavo Jarvi's lively recording, it only becomes clearer to me that Samuel emphasized these passages to generate interest.  What strikes me now is the echoing of Wagner's Meistersinger in the first movement, and the rather childish valedictory chorale in the fourth movement that is too embarrassingly similar to the fourth movement of Brahms' first symphony.  Rott's endless anticlimactic variations are annoying - even Brahms would say \\"Get to the point!\\"<br /><br />At least, Jarvi's fleet performance is listenable.  Jarvi does his best to make the Mahlerian famIliarities less blantant.  This performance  does make me think that Rott had potential.  The orchestra and recording are excellent.  The reconstructed movements from the suite are negligible at best.  My advice is that if you must have this work in your collection, this version is the one to get.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|me and my grandkids had fun working together to escape each level. can wait for new levels. great job in creating a fun and challenging game for all ages.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Complex, gripping, makes for interesting intro to the game of thrones even though I hadn't watched the series. Books are always better than the dramatizations...
B006CHML4I|4.0|Goes great with jeans and more casual clothes.  Keeps time accurately.  I like the buckle wrist band as my wrists are small and the watch doesn't slip around.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend of 11 years as he is a huge anything to do with the Beatles fan. The day after I got it in the mail he had just  finished his 2nd round of chemo and he played it all day. So yes it was a great buy I give it a 5.<br />Thank you.

B000KG499M|4.0|I bought this not on my Gundam but on my Terminator T800 action figure,<br />I like the futuristic design thats why I bought it on my terminator, it will not<br />really hold the T8 figure but I did find a way.<br />+This is well made plastic, japan made so you will have a hard time<br />  understanding the jap instructions buy you can understand the figures.<br />+Well design not flimsy plastic<br />+Not recommended for other action figure<br /><br />Overall I like the product with some instruction issue
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Best show on television, hands down. Creepy, eerie, and very suspenseful! Every season has a different plot, which I like about the series. If you never saw the show before, watch the new season that starts in October 2013!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Not enough detail, watched the show foe 7 years and detail  left out. You took should have been more depth  and left me  hanging trying to recall.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Great Gatsby, 2013, was by far the best summer blockbuster. The soundtrack itself was highly anticipated, and it delivered addictive songs. The director, Baz, really went over the top with this movie, in a good way though. He portrayed Gatsby's parties perfectly, full of glitz and glam. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoyed the book. Even people who didn't read the novel still enjoyed the movie, like my mother. And for kids who have to read this for English class, this movie isn't exactly like the book, so it won't help with your report!

B005MVJM3I|4.0|Very happy they are playing good thrash again.  However, it's new and even more complex that their earlier albums.  An album to make a machine head fan happy.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|I love this movie and was very excited to find it on blu-ray at such a great price. It also arrived sooner than expected, which was an added bonus as it was a gift

B002B0NAV8|5.0|Happy to have this back in my collection.  This is just a great album to have in one's playlist.  Hearing it again makes be realize how much influence they have had on the sound.
B008N1LL42|4.0|This was a fast, fun movie for light-hearted sci-fi fans. I thought it was pretty entertaining, and I was able to overlook some of the more questionable aspects of the plot (such as two dozen old timers being able to get an out of service battleship running in about an hour), because, after all... you really shouldn't take this movie too seriously. Think about it- it's based on a classic board game, and it's a tale about alien invaders doing battle with naval ships stationed in Hawaii. It was very clearly influenced by the Transformers formula, the big name in the Hasbro stable. I think kids and teenagers in particular will love this movie, but I'm 33, and I still had a good time watching it.<br /><br />The design and CGI execution of the alien war ships is positively awesome, the best I can remember ever having seen. Though the actual alien creature design is not particularly interesting or original, their machines are the real stars of the show. Major kudos to the CGI team that put this movie together, because the special effects are just incredible. Furthermore, these ships become engaged in a strategic battle with the US Destroyers that tastefully (and cleverly) pays homage to the board game after which this movie is (VERY LOOSELY) based.<br /><br />This movie is fun, and the special effects are super cool. Blu-ray transfer is spectacular, and it really pops off of the screen. The characters are charismatic, the plot moves fast, and the tension is convincingly conveyed throughout. I liked it- who would have ever thought that old board game could trigger this concept in somebody's mind? I applaud the creativity!

B00BVMXBDO|5.0|This is a pretty decent show. Not better than GOT or Homeland. But pretty good. The actress I hope get nominated for some kind of award, cause she definitely deserves it. She did very well at differentiating between all the clones. Now, while watching the pilot there were a couple of scenes that seemed kinda corny & I almost stopped watching. But I'm glad I didn't cause each episode just got better & better. I just want to know what's up with Mrs. S...

B009K0OPQQ|5.0|This one's good. I like the idea of all our favorite fairytale characters living together in the same story. Pretty cool idea! It's a good family show. Although it may be to mature for the little ones.
B0038Z5SEW|1.0|If you do not know anything about the wilderness or bears and believe in teh tooth fairy then you may like this movie.  Otherwise, it is so hokey that it made me laugh becasue it is so lame.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This show is sooo good! I've never really paid much attention to Claire Danes since My so called life. But she can ACT! In S1 when she was off her meds & took a trip to crazy town.. that's when I knew. And Damien Lewis is good too. He does creepy reallly well. Good writing, great acting & very entertaining. You won't be dissapointed.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Canadian indie rock duo Tegan amid Sara makes the drastic jump into mainstream pop music consciousness and wonderfully too I might add. The beats are catchy and the lyrics witty as you have come to expect from the sisters. Despite what some others my say I think despite a new turn in direction the music remains the same lyrical (I did go back and listen to their discography). The lead track and single \\"Closer\\" set the bar pretty high for the album which the sisters wonderfully maintain. My favorites are \\"Closer\\" which is a wonderfully bouncy song that you can't help but like it; \\"I Was a Fool\\" which is a lower midtempo ballad beautifully written and sung; also \\"Goodbye, Goodbye\\" , \\"Drove Me Wild\\", and \\"I Am Not Your Hero\\".

B009XIXVU6|5.0|A simple plot taken through the myriad of time effortlessly giving the reader an entertaining read. The author has a way with words that brings to life his characters and allows the plot to be woven intricately.
B007TNS6JI|2.0|This game holds very little to bring an actual RPG. It's very repetitive and gets rather boring fast as there is no real story line and you have to purchase better gear with real money. That, or fight continuously to try and get enough coins and gems to get better gear.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|I love the app. It has different reading plans. It has a LOT of Bible versions. You can even listen to the Bible. But there is one problem. You have to have wifi to do anything. Sure you can download some of the versions. But it almost completely limits you from anything without Internet access. So I recommend this app for those of you who have frequent access to wifi, but for those who don't, find some other offline apps and books.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|Definitely top 10 fave for me :-) great action and story line. Really heart wrenching and warming hero story. You really need to see this if you haven't yet!

0345803485|3.0|Can I just first say, good for Anastasia Steele and her first boyfriend pick!  I'm pretty sure my first boyfriend got fired from his job at UPS, dropped out of college, and is currently in jail somewhere.  Got to love fiction giving a girl Christian Grey, the most gorgeous billionaire playboy on the planet.  Good for Ana.<br /><br />I heard a lot of criticism about the poor writing of this book before I read it so either I was prepared or in my very limited experience reading romance novels in the past let's just say I wasn't expecting Shakespeare.  The book has no plot to speak of; it's just the interaction (and very intimate interactions) of young, super naive Bella Swan, oops I mean Anastasia Steele, and as drop dead good-looking as a marble statue, Edward Cullen...oops again, Christian Grey.<br /><br />The bad:<br />Cheesy Writing - Now, to begin with I did find the writing somewhat annoying and super cheesy.  The chronic mentions of Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconcious\\" were on my nerves quick as was Christian's frowning and setting his mouth into a \\"hard line\\".  Also, Ana's ubiquitous inner dialogue is rampant with phrases like, \\"Oh my!\\" and \\"Oh Fifty.\\"  Ewwwwwww.  Just the thought of it makes my skin crawl a little but so have almost any romance novels I have read so it goes with the territory in my mind, thereby making this bullet a neutral point in the scoring of this book.<br /><br />Christian Grey - My inner femininst goddess did a ton of backflips throughout this book, let me tell you (hint: so does Ana's).  It's hard to put aside my beliefs that this very controlling, sexually \\"sadistic\\" man should make a good boyfriend for Ana, or any woman. It's a peek into the Dominant/Submissive lifestyle but I think this sets feminism back a few hundred yards in that he makes girls call him \\"Master\\", tells them what to eat, and controls who they talk to.<br /><br />Length - This book is longer than I thought it would be!  At over 500 pages it set me back a littlelonger than I expected it to.<br /><br />The good:<br />Christian Grey - Yes he makes both the good/bad list for the simple fact of what a complex character he is and I doubt most romance novels contain an anti-hero with such depth.  He is \\"fifty shades of 'messed' up\\", hence one meaning of the title.  In the same respect as Lisbeth Salander, he is a difficult protagonist to like.<br /><br />It's hot - The same thing that annoys my inner feminist goddess (sidenote, if my repeat references to my inner goddess have annoyed you thus far, do not read this book.  I'm actually testing you.)is the same thing that makes this book hot.  In this age of men that won't call, or take you on a date, or hold the door for you, a man like Christian Grey who comes sweeping in, makes all the decisions, and shows you how it works in the bedroom is in two words: anti-feministic and hot...very hot.  I'm onto #2 next
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Knowing the story, I thought this would be interesting.. Hollywierd went a bit too far in trying to make this into a NEW childhood story. At times it felt they lost their way, and I know they had to build up on a short story but come-on, they missed the key parts by focusing on the giants and grossness.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I had high hopes for this book and couldn't put it down but unfortunately the closer I got to the end, the more I disliked it. I hated how it ended. I left feeling utter disappointment.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Highly recommended. Another interesting story, which makes you not want to put the book down. Hoping<br />The story somehow continues.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The characters in these books are great. You either love them or despise them with all of your being. Prepare to buy the next in the trilogy as soon as you finish this one.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Does have very strong links to Harry potter and twilight, still good story great page flipper, the weird love triangle I could do without.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|These books are addictive. They keep you on the edge of your seat and continuously wanting more. I was sad when it was over.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This is a great album and I play it a lot. My girlfriend sings this in the car. This is a nice album.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|There are disturbing scenes in all three books, but they kept me on edge until the end. I loved this trilogy and recommend it highly.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|***may contain spoilers***<br /><br />Book 2 was more addictive than the 1st, but so much worse at the same time. You simply HAVE to read it, you'll get annoyed by the way it's written, but seriously sucked in as well. It's so confusing.<br /><br />My main gripe with this book is that Ana and Christian are in such an abusive relationship, but because the sex is good, it seems that that's ok. The fight over EVERYTHING, he controls her completely and she's always scared she's upset him, or that he's angry with her, she's like a child and I really really want her to stop being such a martyr and grow a pair. And with all christians issues, they've managed to change him from a BDSMer to someone trying to find a coping mechanism. very convenient. If I lived the BDSM lifestyle, I will be disgusted that my way of life is something to 'recover' from. But I don't - so moot point I guess.<br /><br />I got bored with the sex, it hasn't grown at all. It's still Ana gasping wide eyed and 'oh my'ing and Christian sauntering with smouldering eyes. The places they have sex change, but the style in which they do doesn't. I actually found myself skipping over some sex scenes!<br /><br />I have to keep reminding myself that this really is a YA novel, it's for those young 17-18yo girls who crave to be looked after but want to see themselves as independant. That's really who this is for. I found myself feeling quite indignant that a man could control her that much, not in the bedroom but in life. He won't let her see her friends, makes her feel upset when she 'steps out of line' etc. good god that got my blood boiling! - yet I kept reading. I kept reading the horribly repetitive descriptions and eye rolling, gasping, lip thinning, 'I won't leave's but then try to leaves, and couldn't stop. Perhaps it appealed to my 'girly' side, I'm not sure.<br /><br />There's no doubt the E.L.James has captured 1000s of people in her books, and has really opened the doors for softcore erotica on the market, people seem to be OK reading these books in public, where as before it would be considered smut. So good on her!<br /><br />I'll be reading the Third one without a doubt, enjoying it but being annoyed at it I'm sure. But I think afterwards I'll stick to Elizabeth Hunter type authors who are a bit more mature in the story line.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this game is a lot of fun. It is not too easy and at the same time it I s not too hard. It gives you a challenge without leaving you frustrated.
B004SRNH10|5.0|From what I understand, this is sort of an operating system.  I had to install this before another Android app would work.  I've not had any problems with it.
B000VHMI7A|5.0|Julius Katchen shows us his deep understanding of Brahms piano works. I have played many of these pieces and immensely enjoy listening to them. It is nice having it all in one place! Although it is an older recording, I would recommend this set to anyone who has a liking for Brahms.<br />As an aside, I found a 1947 quote attributed to Katchen after he decided to permanently live in Paris. &#34;In France piano students come together constructively, and they can even become friends. They attend one another's concerts and applaud. In the US they go to hear a colleague play, but only in the hope of seeing him break his neck.&#34; I hope things have changed some since then!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This one is fun.  Hope the wait for more levels isn't too long!<br /> Great way to kill time while waiting for doctor or dentist, etc.  Had no trouble loading or playing.
B001208QSA|5.0|I became acquainted with Phil's music back in the 70's with one of his early albums entitled &#34;Glassworks.&#34;  I haven't seen The Hours, so I don't know what one experiences hearing this music while viewing the film, but the music stands alone beautifully. Some people find Glass' style dark and oppressive, but I find it intriguing, somewhat meditative, and peaceful. It is another great example of crossover between what we call &#34;classical&#34; music and music written for film. Generally speaking, I feel that composers who write for film do not usually get the credit they deserve. If you like Glass' music, I think you will like this album.
B00322PK2G|5.0|EXCELLENT

B003H6KRIE|5.0|I remember when these came out in the theaters, what a great film trilogy. The blu-ray format looks spectacular and the extras are interesting too.  They go over soundtrack and special effects so you see what it really took to make the movies.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I liked the concept. We got to the fifth level. But every thirty second or so it would crash and we'd have to start the application again. Fortunately, it would restart exactly where it left off.<br /><br />Eventually the constant crashes got tiresome and I uninstalled.

B008AK8FHM|2.0|I spent most of this book waiting for proof of his proof and all I got was worms. Too much of an hallucination and no substance. Short book and long on trying to convince without any substantiation of anything other than he loved his family and they were worried about him. Duh.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|We decided to watch this because the second movie is coming out soon.  I'm a Bruce Willis fan and everyone played their parts well.  It was fun to watch and had good characterization and dialogue.

B00BLDD3A4|4.0|This is an excellent CD with an all-star cast of musicians. There are so many tallented artists at their best that I can't name them all here.  This should be a must have album for all rock fans who love the genere for its creative talent, not for the pre-packaged bands that occupy the airwaves today.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love it, excellent audio quality, excellent mic, I just plug it and voila, fantastic.<br /><br />I sometimes experience a 2 seconds blackout on the audio, but it happens like once a week or so, so, no problem for me.
B00CY1JUW2|3.0|I love this band, and couldn't wait for the album to drop since a friend sent me a UTube link to a live performance of my God is the sun.  Unfortunately the rest of this album doesn't return to the same level of the single.  There are some bright spots other than the single.  Wait by the sea is a good melodic song.  Most of the album is a lot slower in tempo than the average fan is used to.  There is the possibility of a creative direction starting with the band, but now I just recommend the singles.
B009CRJLHU|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have read. I love the bad boys  books and this one did it for me. I haven't read any books from this author before but I look forward to reading more!

B00B69UQJY|5.0|As a band - Depeche was # 1 for me & seemed to flow along w. my life no matter the changes~<br />I was a consitent fan if not avid - even switched<br />more & more to Classical music - lots of pop<br />& rock did not evolve w. me over the years so<br />I was very dubious about Delta Machine after<br />reading the reviews -but.even on the first initial<br />listening - it suits me just fine - even perfectly.
B008133MDK|5.0|It's so witty and suspenseful! One of my favorite shows. It's just so engaging and entertaining. Rich characters and plenty of humor. A must-see.
0439023521|5.0|I never wanted to read this book because I really didn't think I would like it.My grandson and I read it together and I absolutely loved it. Tremendous imagination and well detailed characters. Well worth the read as long as you don't take the story literally and remember it's just a story.<br />Carol
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is one of my favorite TV shows! Each episode is 90 minutes so it's longer than a usual TV series episode, but slightly less time than committing to watching a full movie. Episode 1, I think, is still my favorite - but they're all good, each one brings different witty and memorable remarks. It's so engaging with details and fun characters. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are just so perfect in their characters. This is a must-see show!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think it is a great game but maybe next time can you make the players cost a little less other than that its great!!!!!! Thanks for making the game!!!!!!!

B001TH16DI|4.0|I'm not going to talk about the movie content, just about the quality of the Blu-ray set<br /><br />I've had this combo since it was first released as a set on VHS [with a free chest piece insignia]. I've picked up various updates and director's cuts over the years. I REALLY wanted to have one box set. When mine arrived, I was shocked at how dark the reproduction was. Earlier versions had correct lighting, not this one. That was very disappointing. Also, even though it says that these were the original movies, it would have been nice to see the directors cuts as they were much more enjoyable. The added bonus was the disc \\"The Captain's Summit\\". I'm big on things like this and this is what is missing from the internet based programming. I love the commentaries or the behind the scenes things. But this one extra disc made it that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />I've been a fan since the 60's. Enjoyed every movie - even V. But the quality isn't quite up to snuff on this box set.
B000065R29|4.0|A window into an interesting world. Fast-paced, complex emotional situations. Visually stunning and the creative timeline mean that I'll be watching this film more than once.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Not only is this an excellent television series but this is also exactly how seasons should be packaged and sold.  Buying this product is win win.  It definitely feels like you get more than you pay for.  I hope that doesn't mean that they're going to start charging a lot more for the seasons that follow.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Good game if you are patient. Don't like the requirement to spend money on aura in a game really designed for kids.
B009JBZH54|4.0|I found this series to be an interesting take on the franchise.  After the rubber nipples, puns, and revolving Bat-door I had lost interest in what a Batman Movie could be.  These movies brought me back around.  They weren't perfect but they're damn good.<br /><br />I'm glad that I waited for the set before I started buying the movies.  It wasn't a conscious decision, I just never got around to making the purchases.  This set offers all of the movies and plenty of extras to make it a good purchase for fans of this particular movie franchise.
B009MYARIK|1.0|I had really enjoyed Kinsella's other books (laugh out loud funny parts) and had looked forward to her newest novel. I can honestly say this is one of the worst books I have read. I actually skipped over parts just so I could get to the end. The characters are not very likable and had no real depth. I really feel like I wasted my money on this book and will be hard pressed to want to read any more of her books in the future. Time to find a new author!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this show as I hadn't read the books but I was pulled in immediately.  This is a perfect example of the live action version sparking interest in the written works.  After watching the show I had to know how much I was missing.  There's definitely a lot going on but is written so well that you can still keep up with the main story arcs.  I definitely recommend purchasing this item.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I totally love it and try to make sure I read it every day.  Many versions to choose from awesome.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I seen this movie and the remake and the original always wins out.  The story begins with the town is getting ready for a huge 100 year old anniversary just as the night begins the entire town falls apart at 12 midnight exactly, just as the town goes haywire the town's priest's wall in the church's huge bolder comes down exposing a very old diary after he begins to read his grandfathers diary he realizes he was one of the men responsible for the sailors untimely deaths. His Grandpa writes about a huge fog rolled in as a fake fire was set up for to lead the sailors onto the rocks destroying the clipper ship bought by the head sailor in the crew. 100 years later the story is passed down that when the fog returns the sailors will return looking for revenge. Which they do The fog rolls back in the priest realizes the other item in the wall was the gold melted down from the gold the head sailor had in his possession and was stolen from. they invade the church the priest offers himself as one of the 6th conspiritors he gives back the gold they leave and in the end of the movie they return to claim the priest as the last victim
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Its magic the gathering, runs smothly on my phone. I havent tried an online battle yet but single player is not bad
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun but it takes awhile to figure out the clues so it is very fun but tricky so there
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had little intention of reading this book, but figured I would satiate my girlfriend by reading a chapter. She hasn't been able to talk about anything else for the last couple of weeks. I actually read this in two days. That first chapter sucked me in and just couldn't put it down. Great job Mr. Howey!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am really enjoying this hidden object game.  I does have some repetativeness.  But I have not had to spend any money and with enough time you open new rooms.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It is AWESOME!! I think it should give you more time than only thirty seconds. I still recommend this game. It is very cool!!!!!!
B0062YADWI|5.0|It is smaller than I thought but also lighter. Great for a key chain. Now where do i find a bottle to open?
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Khaled's scene and character build-up are first rate. The framework for the storyline, however, seems to wander through too much of the same type of human sacrifice caused by familial/moral/guilt-based obligations. I can only surmise that the point he's trying to get across is that Afghanistan might be a great metaphor for much of humanity whose life circumstances have caused them to be nomadic love-seeking survivalists.
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|This remake is just as good as the original!  A big hit with the whole family!  I highly recommend Sabrina!
B0053O89WY|4.0|Great cast.  Great writing.  The cast works extremely well together.  Like most great comedy series, the cast has no weaknesses and the writing seems always to capture a unique angle.
0920668372|5.0|I used this book when I was teaching school and the children loved it.  I get tears every time I read it aloud.  Lost my original copy, so I reordered it from Amazon and have read it to a group since then.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is one of the best series shows I have seen.  The multiple story lines that develop keep the audience's attention.  I had a little difficulty understanding some of the British accents, particularly with the servants, but after several episodes, I began to catch most of what they said.  After a few months, I will replay the series again.  I'm looking forward to the Fourth Season.
B0076HN3T0|5.0|True Rock and Roll story.  Boys who LOVE to play music. A must see for any fan of music or excellence.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is the best way to pass the time and this version makes that happen so much easier. With options for everything from the background to the cards face and back.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this app!! I have used it constantly (!) for trips, and it hasn't failed me once. I became a member so I can post reviews too, and help others!

B00CWY76CC|1.0|If you close it out  and come back to it you have to start all over..unless I am missing something.. but you no long have the clues you found...what ever the problem I took it off..
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I thought this was fantastic-the joy they show as they play their music and the scenery was spectacular.  A very uplifting experience.  I have recommended it to all my friends.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|So different to what I expected! This book tells the story of a global pandemic through a series of post-war interviews. A new take on the zombie genre this book focuses more on the political and social impact of a pandemic. Max Brooks does an amazing job of taking on the voice and style of the different interviewees as their small stories build a bigger picture of the whole event. Best book I've read in ages!
1609611543|5.0|For anyone that needs to lose weight and wants to understand the impact that wheat and wheat products have on that process, this is a must read.  It is very enlightening to say the least and makes sticking to my &#34;diet&#34; so much easier.  You shouldn't think of it as a diet, but a lifestyle change in eating habits and it is not that hard to do.  The benefits make it all worthwhile.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I was glad when I saw, that Khaled wrote another 'bestseller', but I got disappointed fast.<br />The first quarter of the book was great and exiting - then<br />The story of the greece doctor and his friend Thalia was too long and not necessary, also the story of Pari's mother was far too long and not either necessary for the story.<br />A pitty.
B0094K1MH2|1.0|I took my kids to see this movie and we all thought that it dragged on forever! I could not get out of the theater fast enough! The animation was interesting but if the story isn't exciting you have a bad movie. I only gave it one star because I had to in order to place the review.Bottom line.....spend your time on something else!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is great for young children. You can raise and breed awesome  dragons<br /> You can also play with your friends online.
B00144VBBS|5.0|Had quite a few songs on it that I had forgotten. Really an enjoyable CD to listen too! Buy it!
B005LAII8K|4.0|Please note that I saw this on a movie channel so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer or its features.<br /><br />Looper is a unique future dystopia movie. It falls into that famous category of science fiction movies because, well, as with most future dystopias, in the immortal words of Zardoz \\"the future doesn't work.\\" :-)<br /><br />It's also a rollicking time travel tale with all the usual time travel paradoxes that we sci fi fans know and love, such as older and younger versions of the main character criss-crossing each other's time lines, the idea that time is ultimately a loop that coils back on itself, if you kill your grandfather, do you disappear (or vice versa), and other fun ideas that we're all familiar with.<br /><br />In this future dystopia, time travel has been achieved but outlawed presumably due to the possibility for misuse. This means that only the criminal organizations use it for their own nefarious purposes, using loopers who are sent back in time to dispose of people they don't like. The looper hit men are paid well and make a good living, but eventually their contracts expire, resulting in a situation where the older loopers are sent back in time to be killed by their younger selves so as to dispose of the evidence and \\"close the loop.\\"<br /><br />There's a lot of violence and Bruce Willis is fun to watch as he repeatedly outwits and beats the bejesus out of his younger, overconfident, but not nearly as experienced self. It's sort of like watching a combination of his Diehard role and Time Bandits. The acting is top notch and the script is decent. Willis is able to convey volumes of dialog just with his eyes and facial expressions. In contrast, his younger self (don't recall the actor's name) hardly ever changes his facial expression, but instead imitates Willis's mannerisms. They made an interesting pair. Overall, a fine movie that reprises many famous time travel paradoxes in a new way.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|For those who, like myself, are getting ready to go to college, and are going to be living in a dorm, this product is perfect! It's extremely light weight, versatile when moving around, and small enough for easy storage. This is by far the best dorm gift you could give or get at a great low price!!!
B005LJITS0|1.0|so let me get this straight, Warner Brothers wants to make a justice league movie that will be able to top The Avengers, well good luck now. THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE. Not even worth the 2 bucks i spent on it, I honestly want my money back. Why hasent hollywood realized that the guy from that movie &#34;Waiting&#34; is gonna F up anything you put in him, hell he would have made a way better flash, opps well it to late for that now huh?  who ever produced this movie should be sent to a mexican prison..... and ryan reynolds too
B002GOAH1U|5.0|Such a wonderful story of self realization, love, and comedy. Amanda Bynes and other main actors do a superb job.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is cool. Cool can be a good way to describe it. It is cool. Cool. It is also neat. Have I fulfilled. my twenty word requirement yet?
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is fun and does not get old, it's fun to play with your friends and it is just awesome.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I enjoyed this item, though getting the batteries installed was a bit of an ordeal.  The sound isn't an exact match to the show, but it is pretty close.  I haven't done much with the pen part, but I did try out the invisible ink tip.  It is pretty neat, though the cap on the invisible ink tip is a bit loose.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is fun and mind challenging. You have to think about your next move to keep within the allotted moves. It gets more challenging the more you do. ozziefin
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Exiting movie well done. In was stuck in my seat and can move my eyes out of the scree.<br />Great waiting for the end that never comes
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Great product and speedy delivery .<br />I was connecting the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 via my Hosa DI Box and Amplitube 3 on my mac . The result = Wicked . All the high gain amps works perfectly without latency and noise. With this setup , I'm able to record my gain amps thru my garageband perfectly.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book will grab your attention and hold it until your eyes pass the very last punctuation mark! It's very practical and will leave you thinking, &#34;I couldn't have said it any better.&#34; That's how you know it's good, when you read it and realize there's nothing left to be said and everything is perfect.
B00A8M7H42|5.0|These &#34;New 52&#34; Justice League statues from Kotobukiya look amazing.  An excellent addition to any collection.  I thoroughly recommend getting them.
B00DCX08MW|2.0|The game has potential, but I was expecting more then 3 missions (without purchasing more) that last a min or 2 each.
1609611543|4.0|I don't thin k I would call this a &#34;Diet Book&#34; if that is what you want.... it is more like an education on why wheat might not be as good as the food pyramid folks preach.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|am I missing something I wonder? after level 10 it is forcing a review and telling to keep because more levels will be coming.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app I love horses they are amazing so this is the perfect app for me you groom do competitions and feed your horse highly recommended
1907947655|5.0|Beautiful story...fit for all ages and genders.  Story and writing is amazing.  Nothing too special, though about the anniversary edition although the cover is pretty and simple.
B00338QENI|5.0|I highly recommend this book!  It touched on many issues I never thought about in cell/tissue research and the ethics of these issues going forward.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is another awesome game from G5 games. Excellent graphics and storyline. Will definitely buy another game from G5. Great job G5
B007IXWKUK|3.0|After reading the original 50 Shades, I want left wanting more. This 2nd book did not entice me at all. Still debating on reading the final book in the series.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Didnt think i would like it but the demo hooked me. I want to finish the game now. All games should let you play through a chapter so u will know if u like it. I usually never buy a game unless i've tried it first.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Just discovered Darius Rucker (after being a Hootie Fan) and now have 2 of his country Cd's - this one is just sensational. Love every song and his voice is just addictive, so pure and can't get enough.
B002BWQ6H6|3.0|Although this book is expertly crafted , I found it distancing and not emotionally engaging.  One can admire the writing and concept, but For me the emotions seemed mannered and unconvincing.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|This classic will continue to bring thrills to another generation of sci-fi fans thanks to blu-ray technology. I enjoyed it tremendously.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|Sudoku 4ever Plus supports a sudoku gamer very well. Beautiful interface, some functions like draft and indicator that something is wrong.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|the numbers glitches when I press 1 it types in 2 and the other thing is the back space does not work.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app allows me to have total confidence in marketing plans and when to take precautions. I become d this app to all family and friends
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Game of Thrones is my favorite show. I bought seasons 1 and 2 so that my family and friends could also watch and it was worth it. Can't wait until season 3 becomes available.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Love Lindsey Stirling's energy and how she expresses herself through the violin.  Her playing, dance, costumes and sets in the videos are equally fantastic!  A kindred spirit!<br /><br />Top Favorite videos:  Shadows, Elements, Crystallize, Spontaneous Me<br /><br />Favorite songs:  Transcendence, Crystallize, Anti Gravity, Song of the Caged Bird, Elements, Spontaneous Me, Minimal Beat, Electrict Daisy Violin, Zi-Zi's Journey, etc.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Once again, James Rollins has crafted an intelligent, thrilling novel, further cementing him as one of the best authors in his genre. As always, it is grounded in real (and altogether fantastic) science; I always feel I've learned something new when I finish one if his books! Go pick it up; if you've been a fan of his other novels, or even if you haven't, you won't be disappointed.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|I so loved this book. At first I didn't  think it was anything interesting,but once you start reading you can't stop. Once I actually had such a hard time stopping that I felt some sort of guilt putting the story away. In a way, the book  taught me so much about Greek Mythology... Which is surprisingly interesting. I really enjoyed Percy's personality and perspective on everything.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Highly recommended.  Aside from the great classic rock soundtrack, it just has a very feel good approach to it's plot line about humanity and human kindness.  Check it out
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It is a great read for teens like me and is full of romance, adventure, and suspense. It took me a while to get into it, but once i did, I was hooked.
0062255657|5.0|One of the best Neil Gaiman's books. It was tempting to read it all in one sitting, but I paced myself to be sure not to miss any of the wonderful language nuances. I finished it last night and I miss it already :)
B00CA4S27W|5.0|Outstanding in every regard. Candice Knight is comparable to Grace Slick, Nancy Nevins  (before her accident), Emmylou Harris and Joan Baez (with a touch of New York City's Patty Smith's accent thrown in. She is a poet,singer, performer, and an overall remarkable woman as are they. As they do, she puts herself completely into her work  and makes you feel her genius. I sure do encourage everyone to purchase and enjoy the album . Mr. Blackmore is a perfect match for her. His vast ability to play any style of music and probably 99.9% of musical instruments (stringed or not) , write, and perform are amazing and always have been, They enhance and complete each other. I hope for much more great music and poetry from them! I just wish they would come to Tucson!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Easy and quick once you get the hang of it.  But only 10 floor levels.  Finished rather quickly, needs to be just a little more challenging.
B009DH379C|4.0|good concert, but I think Wembley is better in quality and peerformance. But you'll never miss with a queen concert
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Season 3 did not live up to the reputations of Seasons 1 and 2. They seemed to be trying too hard to think of plot twists and development; the events in the storyline didn't flow as well as they normally did. Also, the way the characters handled social issues didn't seem to be appropriate for that time period. Hope the next season is back to its former quality!
B0017VG69U|5.0|A must for any avid Star Trek fan.  This season is harder to find than the others for some reason.  Truly enjoyable.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|This is a really great show with a good mystery in each episode. I can't recommend it enough. Everyone who likes a good mystery or monsters should definitely give it a try at some point. Take it from me. You won't be sorry.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Really great for a free app and most all the sounds are realistic . . .grand baby loves the night sounds with the frogs as do I.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so much fun and makes you look twice and look at all the possibilities. I hope they make more levels!!
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|It's very difficult to keep the cut in the same place on the second turn because the first turn does not score the glass deep enough and if you try to score deeper then the cut is not even.  I found it was easier to score the glass; then heat up the cut and quickly cool it with cold water to get a precise break.
B00846REIS|3.0|I think this was a pretty good read but I read Fifty Shades before this and couldn't help comparing the two.  Grey was much developed character than Gidion. And the seduction was lacking.  However, I found the demons Gidion carried and how they affected him interesting.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Started reading it right after the first season aired and I just fell in love with it even more. Cannot get enough Game of Thrones
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|Trial version is way to short. I cant imagine a newb trying it for this short of time and even deciding if they would purchase it.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|Many of the sounds repeat every couple of seconds. The sampling should be much larger.<br /><br />It would be nice to have a volume for each sound plus a total volume.<br /><br />Many are not relaxing or don't sound like the name implies.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|I found this extremely disappointing....this had to be the least challenging game I've ever played !<br />Everything was lacking from game play to graphics ....It basically leads you from one ho scene to the next with a few simple puzzle games thrown in...<br />This is dated.....players of this genre today a r e experienced and expect to be challenged and not treated as idiots.
141694737X|5.0|Got this for our 2 year old granddaughter.  She really likes this book, but I thought she would since she loves Where is Spot?
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This App is the cutest and also a great educational experience. I love playing and learning.  I recommend this App for anyone to use.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Granddaughter loves this case!  She loves to take pics of her and her friends in the pool! She could hardly wait for this to come in the mail.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|The disc came in perfect condition. The movie itself is absolutely lovable. I've watched it 4 times in the last 2 months. Highly suggested.
1781162646|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  Iam a king fan since the begining and this just didn't measure up.  Very slow moving.
1781162646|4.0|I've read two Stephen King books in the past 20 years, Joyland and The Colorado Kid (also published through Hard Case Crime). Really enjoyed both.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Its a must have CD, I've most of her cd, but this is exceptional a must have and a keep sake!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I do not normally write reviews, but I had to rate this app. The best keyboard available hands down. Well worth 5 times the money.
B00APYKXFS|4.0|This game is a pretty good example of a &quot;bullet hell&quot; style. I've read several reviews complaining about some issues in the game, so I will address the issues one by one. Okay, for starters, let me explain how a &quot;bullet hell&quot; game works: you must avoid the lasers fired by other ships (which are red in this game) and collect some sort of item (the yellow &quot;bits&quot;). The other ships, which are the same color as your ship, will NOT harm you if you touch them, only the red lasers can. I've read comments about the background being distracting, this can be turned off in the options menu by setting the graphics to &quot;low&quot;, the screen size can also be adjusted here along with all sounds. Several people seem confused about the &quot;Anti-Gravity&quot; feature, so I will explain how it works: if you're surrounded by too many red lasers, you can either shake your device or double tap your screen (depending on what your settings are) to lose the ring around your ship (which slows down the red lasers when they are in it) to force all red lasers to reverse course for a brief period of time. After a second or two, you will regain the ring around your ship. The &quot;Anti-Gravity&quot; can only be used when the small icon in the upper right of the screen is flashing. The more red lasers you have in your ring, the more bits will appear when you blast an enemy. When enough bits are collected, your ship will enter &quot;Awaken&quot; mode and be invincible for a little while. All of this information and a little more is put on the app description by the company on Amazon's app page.<br />Now, with the explanation of the game out of the way, this is a fun game and it's great for the free app of the day, but in my opinion it is not worth $0.99. Though, there are no adds and the game plays very well, I still expect a little more in the &quot;wow&quot; factor for my money, so I give this game 4 stars out of 5.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok with minecraft you can let your imagination  fly free I love this game I think the $7.00 you pay for is worth it. get this game its worth it if you don't you will regret it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It crashes once or twice but it's worth it it still does good even though it glitches a few times
B00CWY76CC|4.0|interesting game which reminds me of the Myst series for the computer. will be curious to play the additional levels once they are added.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|After reading & really enjoying both &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; & &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; I was looking forward to this & got it as soon as it was available. This work, however, I found to be disjointed and disappointing. Actually looked forward to finishing it & moving on to something else.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|The first of the Inspector Harry Hole novels gives the reader background and insight into the main character with all of his strengths + weaknesses, while the chilling mystery is being unravelled and solved . I am looking forward to meeting Harry Hole in a new adventure.
B00B9LNJ9I|3.0|I did not expect Dido and rap. It would be great except for that. This is one of her best and is a quiet album but the rap on two songs intrudes.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I watched it on TV and have since bought all 3 seasons and look forward to the next also.  I love British movies and Masterpiece on PBS and always look forward to whatever is on.  But Downton is so great.  I really don't know what the difference was in the UK version or the US version, but could be because there was too much time between the TV show and me purchasing the DVD's.<br /><br />I recommend Downton to anyone who loves British movies or Masterpiece.
B001PB3RU8|2.0|The songs all start out slow and quiet and become louder and louder making it harder and harder to hear what is being a said. It was recommended with Lenka and is nothing like Lenka.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Excellent game. I purchased it after playing with friends so many times.<br />Disappointed however that my game came with two tones of &#34;water&#34; pieces that don't fit together as well as they should and look like two different games pieced together.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|Pandorum is a well conceived space based horror story beautifully presented in blu-ray. With constantly building terror, quick scares, and a healthy dose of graphic violence Pandorum delivers on all the dominant horror elements. The science fiction story is limited while coherent, but primarily only present to create the enclosed isolated space necessary for the horror aspects to come into being. The blu ray itself is an excellent transfer, with the omnipresent dark scenes coming through with inky blacks and subtle contrast that will reward a well calibrated display. A recommended buy for fans of horror.
B0087GJ8KM|1.0|I found this book for the most part to be extremely boring and very difficult to muddle through.. If it hadn't been a requirement for me to read by my boss I would have closed after the first chapter and never opened it again.  X
0786956291|1.0|The box does contain some neat looking character tokens but that is it's only strength. Everything is very cheaply made and the box is artificially padded to make it seem like it contains more than it does. That being said, it DOES NOT contain the Player's Handbook OR the DM's Handbook. It contains a \\"Choose-your-own-adventure\\" that supposedly can be used to make a character, and a few pages full of monster encounter suggestions masquerading as the DM's handbook. NOTHING is simply put as \\"This is the species and the information related to the species\\". This will NEVER help a new user and will NEVER be of use to an old one. Even the art on the box and books is a lie, as it is implying that it is throwing back to 1st edition, which just isn't the case.<br /><br />To summarize: It is practically disintegrating in your hands because of how cheap everything is, the books that come with it aren't useful in the least to anybody, and the whole thing is just deceptive. What you should buy are: \\"The Player's Handbook (4th edition) and the Dungeon Master's Handbook (4th Edition).<br /><br />Also, the coupon that comes with it has been expired since 2011.<br /><br />Edit: I returned this worthless set and was charged not only four dollars for return shipping (expected), but also a $9.00 restocking fee. Really?!?! DO NOT buy from this seller unless you are 1000% sure you will not need to return your item. What robbery!
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|The main character has been popping up throughout the series, the storyline is great! gripping and you kind of understand how events came to be throughout the psy-changeling series.
1609611543|4.0|This is an eye opening book about how wheat has changed in the last 40-50 years.<br />The explanations and the studies are very informative.<br />This will be changing my diet!
1852860243|2.0|Don't get me wrong I love the story, it was this specific edition that ticked me off!<br />If you see a version claiming to be from Titan Books Oct 1987 with all the watchmen on the cover, let me tell you right now, IT'S NOT FROM 1987. It's actually a 2008 or 2007 international edition, it's nothing special and really one of the crappiest covers.
B0087ITBPC|1.0|I thought it was lacking greatly in the humor department! I would not recommend this movie to anyone that values your time.
B007REV4YI|5.0|It's a good movie but it seems the trailer was more impressive. I expected more gadgets from Q and there wasn't enough action for me. But for the price of a movie ticket. I should break even in resale, I'm keeping the digital copy.
B00881PTRC|3.0|I only play this when I need a break from reading or playing<br /> a great game for a few minutes. The little character is a bit entertaining begging you to figure it out. The words are not always correct for the subject and are limited. Overall I would give it a 2. 1/2 out of 5
0446389234|2.0|It's a tiny book with the type of cover that makes just opening it liable to ripping the cover completely off. They didn't give a damn about this edition! The font on the cover and back is amateurish and looks out of place. Avoid this edition, even the slightly mysterious cover art seems regrettable in retrospect.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book and I can't wait to read the others!! Collins left us a cliff ending and it makes me want to read more.
0679642609|5.0|The anectodes of the first century Roman emperor in context of Hays' translation and comprehensive introduction make this book stimulating and pensive.
B0095P33IW|4.0|This movie was entertaining, but some of the scenes seemed to drag out a little too long.  I found myself getting &#34;tired&#34; of watching it at times and paused the movie to resume viewing later.  It is a little &#34;juvenile-ish&#34; but that is to be expected from the subject.  All-in-all, I recommend this movie for some light-hearted viewing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game and a lot of fun to play. My family and friends enjoy playing each other very much.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I've seen all the \\"Die Hard\\" movies. The second one, up until this newest installment, was the least of the bunch. But \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" is pointless. The plot is thin and uninteresting; the dialogue is forced, as if Bruce Willis couldn't even convince himself to believe in the movie; and it's hard to care about any of the characters. I wanted to like this movie--I thought all the negative criticism was surely wrong. Well, guess what? The negative reviews are spot-on.<br /><br />Don't waste your money or your time on this one.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a great game and a lot of fun to play. My family and friends enjoy playing each other very much.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I read the other reviews and so I gave it a chance. For the price you can't go wrong. It works well as long as you don't have the greatest expectations that it will greatly improve your old Buck that has seen twenty years of work with no sharpening this will work fine.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|The gameplay is snappy, but the interfaces need some work.  Plus, microtransactions are ubiquitous, which is always annoying.  But it's essentially free, so who's complaining.
B00CCEHR80|5.0|This volume 2 is engineered very well. The quality of the songs are perfect. There are a few songs on vol 2 that are also on vol 1. It didn't bother me a bit. It is that good.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This was a vary good movie all the bell and whistles . Not quite an epic but, A great movie . The acting was good and the special effects where not over done Just enough to give the movie a real feel .<br />Id watch the little ones but , You can trust the rating .<br />I thought it was going to be a sy fy 2 star  but , It was the real Hollywood A+ effort 4 star . Nicely done .
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I have Fairway on all my devices.  a really good game to pass the time.  the graphics and &quot;movies&quot; are the best
B005H9B44A|5.0|Love the story about Thor and Odin! Great action and nice there is a little romance in this, as well.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Was not in to this book as I was in the first one. Gidion Cross got a little soft in this one and his evil side is what makes him Sexy...
0062255657|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, but at the same time there just wasn't as much story and character development as I usually like in my favorite books. It definitely feels like a story that people could go over and over about what everything actually means, but personally that not what I love to do when I read for entertainment. For the world building here, it's actually pretty lacking, everything is just handwaving, and none of it really makes sense, although it is very imaginative. The writing is incredibly visual and masterful, with the story strongly reminding me of Ghibli Studio's anime films. This book is very short, I would personally consider it a novella, instead of a full book, but is a lot of book within the covers. I would recommend this book, but not strongly. I can see why people would absolutely love it, but for me, it was just a little lacking.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|The trailer was the best part of the movie do not even watch the movie watch the trailer it shows the best parts
B00075J3II|5.0|I just love it. Clapton is amazing as is Mr Johnson. My husband and I listen to it in the car often.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A great game that gets your mind working &amp; sometimes thinking outside the box. Some levels were easier than others.
0470913029|2.0|Same as above.  Too expensive and didn't like the recipes.  It is not a priority right now.  Returned w/n 7 days.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I always wait on the new Sigma Force novels to come out and this one had me hooked from beginning to end.  The action was non- stop and the flow of the book kept me guessing as to what might happen next.  The way James Rollins isn't afraid of killing off beloved characters has always had me gasping in disbelief but also always coming back for more!!  I can't wait to see what happens next for the sigma force team.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Totally charming story, great cast. Quality of Blu-ray version is excellent. Wonderful to have in your film library if you like cozying up to escape into movies that combine a total change of scene from one's everyday life and offers a &#34;screen visit&#34; with a host of  endearing characters.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I read the book in 2 days. I could not put it down. I highly recommend reading it!! I have read several John Grisham books, and this book is one of the best. It was easy to relate to the characters as well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I got this game on my kindle fire and it works so good I love this game so much and there is no problems with it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game. I can't wait for more levels that are make me think and pass the time!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great fun, the game was challenging as well as entertaining. Just wish there were more levels. Looking forward to the updates please!
B007C7UZIG|5.0|My saviour for all my steam happenings even though my computer exploded so it made my day and saved my goods.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|A great movie with a good story line to it. One of my favorite movies; I'm glad I purchased it.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Eleanor is the new girl who stands out with her unruly red hair and strange clothes. Park has friends and is established in his school, but he stands out since he's half-Korean and lives inside comic books and music lyrics. When Park tells Eleanor to sit next to him in the bus when no one is willing to give up a seat, a slow friendship blooms followed by an intense romantic relationship. At times Eleanor and Park's romance seems doomed with the obstacles before them, but they don't want to give each other up. The family dynamics are realistic. I adored Park's family and was alarmed by what Eleanor had to go through with her stepfather and mother. This is an 80's book, by the way, so I loved the cultural references. With all the acclaim, I don't think there's more I can add except that I read the novel in a day since it was unputdownable and it stirred my emotions. Don't just read the rave reviews. Read this book if you haven't.
B007N31Z06|5.0|This is a classic movie and at this price (includes iTunes digital copy too) it's cheaper for this classic flick to buy it with the Blu-ray and get the digital copy than buying the digital copy version alone off of iTunes.
B00BESM14U|2.0|I found this movie to be rather disturbing! I have'nt discussed incest with my teenagers and just don't think it is appropriate. I am also tired of movies portraying gay teenagers.
B000PMG16U|5.0|This is a classic movie set but as some others have complained it's not the exact match you've seen in theaters 20+ years ago.  If you're after higher video quality and know you want Blu-ray this is the way to go (it's cheaper by 25%) than the large box set.  You'll sacrifice some additional bonus material but candidly I don't watch those so it's not a large loss for me.
B00817RAN4|4.0|I have read the entire series of books on Blossom Street and would recommend them to women of all ages.  Interesting and real characters
B005LAII1C|5.0|Ted is that perfect guy movie. It was created with tons of wit, has plenty od dirty comedy and features outrageous situations. This is the perfect DVD for the man in your life who enjoys humor and creativity.
B004PR71JC|5.0|I got this CD for my grandson who is 6.  His little sister who is 2 requests this CD be played just about every day!
B00C061I3K|5.0|Being a huge Daft Punk fan it was only a matter of time before I bought this CD, this purchase was a no-brainer, and any other Daft Punk fans out there should buy it too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it was difficult enough to keep me interested and thinking but not to easy where it would become boring. I reccomend this app to everyone!
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I was super pumped when I heard Vampire Weekend was releasing another album, they're a great mainstream indie band that gets a lot of coverage but still sounds underground.  Great for people to listen to who are wanting to get into indie genre.
B001NPDCFQ|5.0|I had watched this movie onTCM. I actually watched because Judy Garland was an actress I had recognized in the movie. It is a well directed and extraordinary way of telling the story of an ordinary family in St. Louis while the one of the biggest events is coming, the worlds fair. Judy has the most amazing vocal...you can see it throughout the movie and to me it stands out in Have Yourself A Merry Christmas. She introduced the song which today that song is a classic. It is a classic
1401324649|5.0|My father is a nearly retired history teacher, and I had a friend recommend this for him.  I heard its like a Forrest Gump style story with WAY more history, I know he'll like it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a great app, I use it when I'm at home and when traveling; gives accurate and up to date weather for any location requested.
B00908DDZM|5.0|We all know Macklemore is a hot artist right now, but my library only has limited copies of this CD and they were all the edited versions! Had to buy the unedited version.
1450400957|3.0|The book shows basic exercises in a unique way - through muscle fiber visibility.  However it was more informative tha motivating.  You can definitely tell the author was French because the majority of all the drawings are female and she's looking right at you.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great entertainment!  Need clearer hints or objects. Some levels are so difficult to figure out.  Level 10 to get the key.  Seriously!
B0081336FO|5.0|Fast paced and intellegent! Benedict Comberbach and martin Freeman are phenominal in this beautifully directed series. I love the extras and the editing, its almost like watching an art film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just read it again for the second time and it was still just as thrilling! It won't be the last either, never gets old!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game!  It wasn't too difficult but not so easy that it was boring. We had a lot of fun playing this game.
B007S7U4AY|4.0|Me pareció una historia muy real,muy creible,eso hace de este libro digno de recomendar.Sus personajes muy bien ubicados en sus roles,otra vez ciertas costumbres de épocas y de familias hacen que la vida de las personas no sea un andar feliz.Lindo final,pero me quedé con ganas de otro desenlace.
B00C8985DU|5.0|Have been a Wings fan since the Wings Over America Tour in 1976.  Have really enjoyed playing the CD set because I had the original vinyl album when released.  Also enjoyed the Bonus Film and book of photographs taken by Linda McCartney.  I have purchased all of the box sets in the McCartney Archive series and this is my favorite.  I highly recommend it for any McCartney or Wings collector!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|AWESOME! My 3 year old son can play with out any help. Funny to watch the fish. My 3 boys understand feeding and taking care of them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Amazing game can't wait for more levels please hurry up please so I can play level 11 I was on this game all day 1through 10
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|I would have given 4.5 stars if possible, as I don't love all the songs - only most of them. The title track gives me goose bumps of pleasure, which is typically reserved for arias in the Magic Flute.
0140186395|4.0|Both my son and daughter had to read this for summer reading .  My daughter loved it.  My son just started, but, isn't complaining .
B002PZC8BM|5.0|I started watching The Mentalist in season 5, so had lots to catch up with. Beginning with season 1, the story line, characters, and interrelationships develop over time, making this a very compelling drama. Simon Baker is the key to it all!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This is a great \\"feel good\\" movie with lots of laughs and a few emotional highs and lows scattered throughout. It works as a great girl's night movie (probably more fitting for women 20 & up) or as a great curl-up-with-your-boyfriend-on-the-couch sort of movie as well.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Has some funny parts for adults, but mostly for children. Doesn't come close to Shrek or Cars, but it's OK.
B00003CXCT|3.0|The DVDs were not scratched or anything but the box was pretty beat up and the UPC label cut out. Otherwise it was fine
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is a very neat and enjoyable game. I would recoomend it to anyone who love hidden games. it also is a fun way to spend down time
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love the game cant put it down<br />great addicting game cant put it xown great puzzles and also very chalanging
142212312X|4.0|I just explain to the new graduates, that this is an old dead guy, but that what he knew and wrote about the business world still holds true.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The &#34;real story&#34; is quite different than the movie. For example, in the book, the zombies don't move very fast. You'll have to find out why this is even more terrifying than running and jumping zombies by reading the book. The narrative in the book is similar to the style used in Robopocalypse, but not quite as well tuned. I found the individual stories a little uneven, but it is still a great read.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is the main thing i play in the morning i love the game u should make a free version of this for people who dont have enough money
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|I don't consider myself a hip-hop \\"critic\\" of any pedigree but I found this album to seem a half-hearted effort at best.  Lupe put out a black cover for his album and, after listening to his album, I found it appropriate to the deep and often dark content of the album (which I love).  In this instance the cover art is about as compelling and content-filled as the album it supports.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I bought this to go along with my 35 ft HDMI cable to connect my Desktop to my 60\\" Samsung TV. I haven't trued yet but I plan on plugging in a powered USB hub to this cable to connect both my mouse and keyboard. (So far, it works well with one or the other)
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I just can't believe there is more to the story, and the way everything was left. Really, Really. well all I can do is wait for the next book. and that is When!!!.Overall the still loved the book. Cliffhanger's and all.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Great movie. It was a gift to my wife which she and I enjoyed watching very much. High quality dvd.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is very addicting !!!! Hub ordered it for himself too and he's as bad as me...what I like about it is that each segment is one minute long, so it's a quick play. How many times have you said ....just one more minute...when you're playing a game ? Now you can say it and mean it. It's a fun intense game...a long game !!!  If I'm sitting, I'm playing !!!!
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I've had the adapter for about a month and so far it has worked flawlessly. I'm daisy-chaining two hard drives and have had no problems mounting both at the same time. NOTE: they both have independent power supplies so they're not drawing power from the firewire connection.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Blu-Ray is worth the extra cost for &#34;good&#34; movies. We are very pleased with the results of this order. It was a gift and greatly appreciated (by recipient).
B00992CF6W|5.0|you get to make any thing you want mantions hotels houses it's so fun I spend all the time on this game
0375869026|5.0|This book is down right amazing.  Read this with you kids.  My DD and I read this for summer reading and we could not put it down.  So much depth, love and truth.  You will be able to sit with your kids and have a real conversation on what it means to be a good person and finding the people that will stick with you forever.  Beautiful book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've been curious to know what everyone was all  a twitter about this book. I found it very different from anything I'd ever read. I really liked it, I liked the characters especially Ana,who is a little naive for her age so slightly unbelievable but some how believable! To me it was a sad love story ,twisted maybe but still a love story the sex was of course a  huge part of story and it was HOT!!  I liked Grey even though he is really freaky, you feel sorry for him. Honestly can't wait to read next and never thought I'd say that!!!
B00CH87HF4|1.0|freemium at its worst.  no fun when you hit the wall and progress is slow all because the game wants you to buy and buy and buy more gems.  Freezes periodically. save your time and look elsewhere .
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I already loved this program but to have it on DVD and hear it in surround sound - phenomenal! And the outtakes are great, as always. Fun, fun, fun!!!
B0092C2X7U|4.0|This game is an awesome time killer, and I love the ragdoll effects. 3 attempts is plenty enough, people reviewing just suck at the game.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|Just when I was getting into the game, it ended. It seemed more like a game preview. Had I played  that far on a preview, I would've gladly paid $5-10 for the rest of the game. As it is, I am not sure if I will buy the second part to this game. I feel disappointed. While gameplay was fun, there should be have been more of<br /> it and more closure at the end of the game.
B00C2VIA52|1.0|I would have love to give it a 5 star but I need to delete 187 Mb whatever that is.  can anyone tell me what Mb is?
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Excellent! Daniel Day Lewis is a master of his craft. A truly inspiring performance and an excellent film. A must see.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Great start to an interesting series, but I would say book 1 is really chapters 1-4. So you will pay $12 to get the 6 books in the series and it may not end at that point. Don't start the series unless you are willing to spend that to get further in the series.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|so far it's pretty simple. it's magic Jr. I installed it since my baby kindle won't. install the magic app. it scratches the CCG itch just fine.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is a really good game you should get it. Your imagination is the limit think of any thing and its their. If only their was more space to make stuff.
193700788X|3.0|I love Sookie Stackhouse.  I know she's a character in a book, but I love her and I wanted more for her than this book seemed to offer.  The book felt rushed, as if there was this need to tie everything up with a neat little bow.  There were lots of questions left unanswered and way too many easy outs for a character who's so unlucky in love and always in trouble.  With so many different characters and diverging storylines to boot, Sookie and the rest of Bon Temps deserved a much better send off.  Don't get me wrong, I am happy for Sookie and the ending she recieved was fitting to a degree (I mean, who didn't see this coming since Book One?), but this story felt miserably contrived and left me longing for what I thought could have been so much more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is not hard at gets me thinking. If you can't figure it out well you are not thinking because I can and I AM 10. So if a kid can figure it out any one can.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Stellar acting by an incredible cast and top notch direction by Sam Mendes makes this, hands down, the best Bond film to date.  I loved being able to delve a little deeper into Bond's past as we try to understand exactly what made him the man he's become.  Great story, and tons of action throughout.  Don't miss it!
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show is incredible, with each episode essentially being a standalone &#34;movie&#34;.  I've never seen a Sherlock adaptation I've enjoyed more! :-)
B000SP3DE2|5.0|Spooky, super cast, and it does the original story good justice.  I ordered it through instant online movies and it came quick.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is great book for someone who likes to hike.  It really opens your mind from what is normally a day hike to the daily encounters on backcountry hiking.  Helped me think about thinks I might want to do when I go on overnight hikes.
B00AWBNNAG|5.0|AMAZING!!!! I am head of heels for this app! This is a must have for any Lego Maniac! I wish I could find a book just like this app but I would still use the app constantly!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Get this app it is totally awesome its addicting fun and easy if you dont get this app you're a loser
B000IOLZZW|5.0|We were looking for a DVD to replace our VHS tape.  This was a great price and now the Grandbabies can see it in HD.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I really like this video and it helps to keep me motivated with my quest for weight loss.  Thanks again.
1250007208|5.0|I am glad that this book has lived up to the hype. Book bloggers everywhere kept recommending Cinder to me, and only when I went on holiday was I able to read it.<br /><br />A brilliant spin on Cinderella, Cinder is a cyborg, which from my understanding means that she is semi-robot. She is the best mechanic in town and meets the Prince when he comes to get something fixed from her.<br /><br />Yes, Cinder lives with her stepmother and two stepsisters, but one stepsister is very kind (although the others are evil, just like in the classic fairytale).<br /><br />Yes, there is a ball to which Cinder is invited, and her stepmother does not allow her to go, so she crashes it! But in this story, Cinder does not transform into a beautiful princess but ends up going in a muddy dress and grease stained gloves! My favourite part was when instead of Cinder's glass slipper falling off, her entire robot foot comes off!<br /><br />Favourite Quotes<br /><br />(Scene where Peony wants to go to the Junkyard with Cinder and Iko).<br />\\"Really, can I? Sounds exciting.\\"<br />\\"It sounds dirty and stinky,\\" said Iko.<br />\\"How would you know?\\" said Cinder. \\"You don't have scent receptors.\\"<br />\\"I have a fantastic imagination.\\"<br /><br />\\"You don't really think this will save Peony, so don't pretend this is about her. She has days. The chances of them finding a cure before-\\"<br />\\"Then my only mistake was in waiting too long to be rid of you,\\" Adri said, running the washcloth between her fingers. \\"Believe me, Cinder. You are a sacrifice I will never regret.\\"<br /><br />He was the fantasy of every girl in the country. He was so far out of her realm, her world, that she should have stopped thinking about him the second the door had closed. Should stop thinking about him immediately. Should never think about him again, except maybe as a client-and her prince.<br />And yet, the memory of his fingers against her skin refused to fade.<br /><br />Kai squeezed his eyes shut and chafed them with his fingers. Even knowing that it was coming, that his father was sick with this incurable disease, it still made no sense. All that had just been lost, taken so quickly. Not just his father. Not just the emperor.<br />His youth. His freedom.<br /><br />\\"E-excuse me?\\"<br />Kai cleared his throat. Stood straighter. \\"I assume you are going to the ball?\\"<br />\\"I-I don't know. I mean, no. No, I'm sorry, I'm not going to the ball.\\"<br />Kai drew back, confused. \\"Oh. Well...but...maybe you would change your mind? Because  I am, you know.\\"<br />\\"The prince.\\"<br />\\"Not bragging,\\" he said quickly. \\"Just a fact.\\"<br /><br />\\"I knew you liked him. You pretend to be immune to his charms, but I could see the way you looked at him at the market.\\" Iko rubbed at the lipstick, smearing it across her blank white chin.<br />\\"Yeah, well.\\" Cinder pinched her metal fingers with the pliers' nose. \\"We all have out weaknesses.\\"<br />\\"I know,\\" said Iko. \\"Mine is shoes.\\"<br /><br />\\"I don't want to tell you how to be a prince, but shouldn't you have some bodyguards or something?\\"<br />\\"Bodyguards? Who would want to harm a charming guy like me?\\"<br /><br />Kai inched toward the table again. \\"Come on. I can't take you to the...B-word; I can't take you to lunch. Short of my unplugging the processor on one of my androids, this could be the last time we ever see each other again.\\"<br />\\"Believe it or not, I'd actually kind of resolved myself to that fact already.\\"<br /><br />Clearing his throat, Kai murmured, \\"You have no idea how to dance do you?\\"<br />Cinder fixed her gaze on him, mind still reeling. \\"I'm a mechanic.\\"<br />His eyebrows raised mockingly. \\"Believe me, I noticed. Are those grease stains on the gloves I gave you?\\"<br /><br />Queen Levana would come for her, and she would be executed. That was her fate. She'd been resolved to it. She'd been prepared for it. Not to be an heir. Not to be a queen or savior or a hero.<br />It would be so simple to let it happen. So simple not to fight back.
B00CUWKHVI|2.0|Perhaps this is an okay pop album. Probably not, it would be too boring.<br />It is certainly a rather bad jazz album from my favourite artist.<br /><br />I love Cullum's surprises. I love his unique style. I like to be challenged by the music I hear. This is not the problem here. The problem is that this album is loud and boring.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|I finished the book last week and then loved it so much I bought the movie.  Although I still believe the book has so much more detail the movie still was very good and thought it was well acted. Betrand in the book was much more despicable and the ending was not quite the same either.  But if you can't read the book DEFINITELY buy or rent this.  It is a wonderful heartfelt and based on a true historical event story, so you are learning while you are enjoying.  It was bittersweet but true to history and what happened to the Jews in France.  July 16, 1942 will now be in my heart forever.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I liked the book.  Wish it provided more detail on disease.  I never fully grasped the narrative approach but I the book was worth the price I paid.
B00AXVIHBU|5.0|Classic, Class (you wish Hollywood wood take notice), Character development and, CAN'T STOP WATCHING. It's entertainment that holds your attention
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft. It is the best game I've got on my kindle. I just hope the updates come out faster on it. I was Inspired by CaptainSparklez
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I am big fan of electronic music in general and I am also a fan of Tegan and Sara.  I wasn't sure how the electronic spin would work for them, but they definitely make it work.  They've always been catchy, but now they have a pop catch that still is distinctly Tegan and Sara.  They've still got the indie cred imo.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|If you have seen the movie made from this book and maybe were a bit disappointed by it, then reading the book will give a story that is five miles deep and wide as the Pacific Ocean. For me it was page turner, especially since I went through a similar year of trying to find myself. Strangely enough, I also went to Italy, then spent six months at an ashram in India and ended up in Japan, not Bali. If you are looking for book to read this summer, look no further, I can recommend this book to everyone who has ever tried to look for spiritual enlightenment.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|Love Passion Pit.  Their first album was stellar and I definitely enjoy the second.  A little more moody and not as many fun songs, imo, but still a solid piece of work.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|So much corruption, blood, gore, and explicit material. It seems like it should be illegal to watch. This series rocks!
B009NOVCTM|5.0|It's some of the best of the best rock 'n roll band of all time.  Well, of course, it's great!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is what we have coming. I can not wait. Great bad guy and Swashbuckling good guy. Serenity is the best part.
B00CLD671A|5.0|Sophisticated, charming, true to life characters, Maggie Smith's humor, beautiful historic setting, interesting plots, true to life holiday experiences , and no advertisement. .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I could play it forever! Once I start I cant stop. I would recommend this to any one
0525953728|4.0|I found the book interesting.  Didn't talk just about the killing.  Learned a lot about the life of a Navy Seal and have such much respect for them and their families.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|She really enjoys this app and never forgets to ask if she can play. Great app for two year olds.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Saw Jaws when I was a kid, and could see the detail, effort and workmanship that went into it.  That's what made JAWS a success.  Thank you seller!  Arrived as described & in good timing,
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This app is really cool and to the point. The display is great, making it easy to understand what your seeing.
B0041QSZTW|5.0|THESE TWO FILMS ARE BEYOND ANYTHING BEING PRODUCED TODAY...MIXTURES OF HIGH AUTEUR AESTHETIC AND PULP NOIRISM.ART DIRECTION,MUSIC, CINEMATOGRAPHY,ARE AT THE HIGEST LEVEL ANYONE BEHIND THESE PICTURES WOULD EVER FIND ,ALSO ROURKES FINEST MOST INTERESTING PERFORMANCES.....DO NOT MISS!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I feel like I get a brain workout when playing this game lol. It's definitely one of my favorite. It's so much fun and its a challenge.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Orson Scott Card's novel of elite child forces that save the human race fell short of the mark for me. I just couldn't get invested in a character supposedly so young (Ender is six) yet so sophisticated. The adult conversations and subject matter fell flat here in a way that never happened in, for instance, The Hunger Games - even for science fiction, the concept of such extremely young and yet talented warriors felt like too much of a stretch. The sense of the Earth in peril is real and well-realized, the enemy very much a part of the flavor of the book - but an elite force of single-digit-aged children? I know a few six year olds, was once one myself - this just didn't have the engrossing power of conviction.
B0000AM6JI|5.0|Al Pacino is a great actor portraying an old retired crime boss, Carlito. Movie shows how difficult it is to get out of a life of crime.
0307279189|5.0|*Born to Run* is an AWESOME book! It has everything - interesting and quirky characters, real life drama, beautiful settings, science, art, and an inspiring message. This books shows us the best in humanity - and I'm not talking about the incredible feats of athleticism (although that's cool, too, of course) - I'm talking about the courage, generosity, and kindness of its characters, and their ability to rise above the mundane and recognize the magic and beauty around them, and in them, and in each other.<br /><br />Karen Molenaar Terrell, author of *Blessings: Adventures of a Madcap Christian Scientist*
B00APYKXFS|1.0|The first two or three reviews talk about all that is wrong with the game: your ship and the enemy ships are the same color, etc. I played with the volume off, but I'll take the other person's word for it that that sucks also, just based on how bad the game does. Granted, I wouldn't have downloaded this if it weren't the game of the day, so naturally I'm not out any money, but the GOTD should be GOOD. Does anyone at Amazon even review the apps before declaring them the App of the Day? This one apparently slipped under the radar. Don't waste your time.
B00APYKXFS|4.0|I paid for this game. Not sorry about that at all. In this shump / bullet hell shooter the enemy ships are not that important, it is the patterns of enemy bullets that are! Will you never want to play 'Radiant Silver Gun' again, I doubt that but I also doubt you will be sorry for twisting your way thru this nearly transcendental BHS.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Fun . Game<br />It's a no brained g a me but fun to play thANKS FOR GIVING ME SOMETHING TO DO WHEN BORED
B008XG1X18|5.0|When i originally purchased Pinterest on my ipod for FREE i fell in love with it. Pinterest has really cool pictures and great ideas that you could use on a regular basis. I would suggest this for everybody.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|Fun Strategy, can play against friends (on one phone, can't play on multiple phones), and has some cool acheivements to keep you busy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing to me. I absolutely loved it. I would recommend it to others. I am going to read the whole series.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Enjoyable read....for me this book was oddly a bit reminiscent of Harry Potter at times, but that could be just me. I would definitely recommend this book as a fun read.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I think this is one of the best albums (and story) of this century.  The lyrics are poetic and poignant.  He has a message for all of us and makes us question the world out there.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|I would staunchly advocate that this one was better than Part 2 after seeing it once but actually buying it and re-watching it weighs on one's patience. Don't buy, just rent once.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This producct is great with many real weapon functions and options the only thing it needs is more weapons which i'm sure will come in a update.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Well researched book that portrayed the true relationship between Roosevelt and Lindbergh. They disliked each other -  their relationship never improved and Lindbergh's expertise was not sought until after Roosevelt's death.
1932100660|5.0|I hadn't even gotten to to the actual chapters before I was amazed. Being a raw vegan, I sometimes think I know it all (not really..) when it comes to a healthy diet and lifestyle, but man was I learning so much! I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00915G6YE|5.0|We are sad the season eight that is beginning now is to be the last.  We have enjoyed this show.  Season 7 did not disappoint!
B001B0G5WA|5.0|Everything that you find in this album will be great. This album is build with very good quality. Sounds really good! The package contains a promotional flyer with other records from Capitol, as exactly was published in 1966. Im happy for buying it,  :)
B009RH973I|5.0|Affordable and does a great job protecting the Kindle. Is also kid friendly in colors they like. I highly recommend this product.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Liked this one. Another Knight and Day and Mission Impossible (with humor) type movie. Funny how the two American government officials are foreigners with thinly veiled accents. Oh well. And to see Mary Louise Parker play a damsel in distress is worth it. And to see John Malkovich play a conservative government questioning gun toting guy is worth it too. Actually if you fear your government don't watch this one. :-) Anyway the best scene is when Mirren's character is in a ball gown one minute and behind a machine gun pummeling a limo the next. Loved it. I think the love story aspect of this mixed with the guns and action make it a good movie for a guy and girl to see together. Perhaps.
B000RLFBP6|4.0|A classic dystopian film, a must see for anyone worried about UAVs and huge corporations that take outsourcing to new heights.
0767827791|2.0|This movie didn't impress me one way or the other. I don't know if the movie plot was an original or a knockoff but it has been told many times. \\"Bored\\" small town girl runs off with \\"troubled\\" drifter. The only thing refreshing I got out of this movie was seeing Kim Novac . . . she was actually pretty in this one. I never thought so in any of the others I saw her in . . . Vertigo for example. And I got to see William Holden for the first time. Actually kinda like him as an actor. He is one of those guys that isn't really good looking but carries himself in a way that makes himself attractive . . . or carried himself that is. But again the plot was another one of rebellion and non-conformity is the new \\"norm\\" . . . . I did read about the background to the movie where some were saying it was an expose of the \\"fraud\\" behind the Eisenhower/1950's \\"ideal\\" America way of life. And that that is why it has become more respected as a movie today. I wouldn't be surprised such cynicism defines such a movie/ideal.
1451673442|5.0|The Magic was very inspirational. It help me further understand the secret. I plan to buy several more to give to friends and family.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is a great implementation of mtg. You don't have the downside of mtgo players and costs. Works great on my galaxy s3
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I enjoyed watching this series so much that I decided to watch it again. It was fantastic the second time around. I'm sorry it is over.
0307949508|5.0|Wish there were more to come in this series, action packed, great drama. An all around great read<br />Reccomend for anyones enjoyment.
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|I enjoyed the original three Die Hard movies, but this attempt was mediocre.  Some franchises grow with repetition, but this one was made for the money, not for the fans.
0307742539|5.0|Part of a great trilogy, wish there were more in this series. Aurthor could have written more of these and they would have been best sellers
B008220D7S|5.0|I absolutely loved this film! It showed the regular ups and downs and comical moments of marriage! It was so much deeper than I anticipated but I loved that it was!! Both funny and heartfelt!!! See this, you will love it!
B008JFUQ3O|3.0|I hard a hard time staying awake. Honestly. It was very boring.<br />Kirsten Wiig is pretty lame. Half-decent for SNL, but stupid for a role like this.<br />Basically the story just comes across as altogether pointless. Nothing or nobody to care about.<br />The plot is kinda... not even there. Whatever happens is just an excuse to have a short story until finally Gru gets married.<br /><br />Between the two big animation films: DM2 and MU... MU is far better. You smile all the way through with that one. This one is a snoozer.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I love this game! You get to fight goblins,ogres,trolls,wolves, and lots of other stuff.  It`s really addicting and a great game.  Oh, and epic graphics too.  5 out of 5 stars.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|One of the greatest shows on TV........Can't believe its been 8 years from the first episode. I have the complete series....can't wait until season 6 is available.  I do keep the latest series recorded on my DVR; and wait well into the next season until the price of the set comes down, well after the initial release.
B00992CF6W|5.0|On the first time I got this game I loved it but when I started to play with it a little more it got stupid because it doesn't have a lot of fun things to make stuff with but what I really want is more animals live WOLVES and ocelots.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I wish there were diamond and gold weapons and armor and enemies<br /> And nether portals.  Why isn't there an ends portal the e under  Dragon
B004DSX5B6|2.0|I bought this for my job which is landscaping and trash. One day when it was raining i had this knife out using it and put it back in the sheath. A few days later this knife was rusted and barely opened even after applying lube. Now this is useless to me.
B0029ATTAQ|5.0|One of the better \\"Big Brother 1984\\" titled movies, I have the other three.  This one is in color and the acting cast of John Hurt and Richard Burton make this a must purchase sci fi movie.  There is more detail to George Orwell book in this movie and covers a lot more detailed aspects than the other old movie.
0385486804|5.0|I watched this movie with my younger brother a few years ago, and never quite got Chris McCandless out of my head. I knew I should read the book, but just recently got around to finally doing it. The book is fairly short, and grabs your attention immediately. I appreciated the author including different explorers and their stories throughout the book, and also his ability to tell the story without a lot of judgement. No doubt, the kid was ill prepared, and probably a narcissist. Regardless, his wanderlust spoke to me, and I somehow understood his need for freedom and exploration, though I've hardly lived a similar life. I recommended this book to my sister, who loved it as well. This purchase was my third copy which was a gift for my brother. This story really resonated with all three of us. I highly recommend it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I remember liking this book but I don't recall all the details. I'm trying to read it again on my iPhone but its forcing me to give a review on a book I haven't read in a long time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game! You search for.things to unlock locks or codes by searching throughout the room while picking up tools and other things to help you out. This is one of my favorite apps to play!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|my kids an I love this game.  it is fun to play and it gives us time together which is nice on rainy days.
030758836X|4.0|After seeing that \\"Gone Girl\\" crossed the one-year mark on that famous best seller list, we presume a very rare accomplishment, we figured there must be something pretty spectacular about this book.  The opening hook:  hubby Nick gets a call to alert him his front door is standing wide open; he returns home to discover wife Amy is just flat gone.  With food on the table and the ironing board in action, it seemed she was just plucked out of her day by persons unknown, perversely on the very day of their fifth wedding anniversary.  What then follows is a half-book of fascinating alternating chapters, half by Nick, each spanning a different day of her disappearance; the other half by Amy as she gives us the full back story on their romance, their marriage, and all the events leading up to her going missing.  We readers ostensibly \\"know\\" Nick is innocent, but of course he is the chief suspect for the police, who in the total absence of other suspects, keep finding more and more damaging evidence pointing straight at the husband.<br /><br />Then during the wild second half of the book, we get the day-by-day account of the disappearance from Amy's view, while the alternating chapters with Nick, who is now working with a \\"star\\" legal beagle to try to stay out of jail, focus on the theory that Amy has not only orchestrated the whole thing, but has pulled off similar tactics against numerous others throughout her life.  An amusing backdrop to all of this are Amy's parents, who comprise the \\"perfect couple\\", assisted by considerable wealth generated by a bevy of children's stories, all entitled \\"Amazing Amy ....\\"  Amy herself is wealthy from a trust fund created for her with some of the book sale proceeds, a fact that frequently enters into the financial machinations of her marriage to Nick.  Nick's relationship with twin sister Margo also contributes various doses of intrigue to the tale.<br /><br />The author's writing skill is nothing short of fantastic; we can see why women in particular will relate to Amy's mental meanderings as she describes and inspects all manner of relationship issues.  Meanwhile, the character Nick is equally well portrayed - so we get sort of a \\"Men from Mars and Women from Venus meet Sherlock Holmes\\" story.  Unfortunately, we didn't see the ending crafted by Gillian as a likely conclusion, and that to us spoiled an otherwise terrific story.  We can easily see why this novel has been so successful - we only wonder if a different ending might have made it nearly a \\"great work\\"!en in particular will relate to Amy's mental meanderings as she describes and inspects all manner of relationship issues.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A little bit of drama, fun and fantasy. Great cinematography. Acting was just so-so. The fantasy scenes are remarkable. Worth viewing.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I don't want to give anything away but this book...this series is such a wonderful ride. Not the usual novel but so well worth it!
B007P6VM04|5.0|I got both smash CD's and they are both great! What isn't on is on the other, I highly recommend both of these CDs for all smash fans!
B00BMTX5IW|4.0|This is a great cd. I love Caro Emerald and every song is a gem. 4 stars because I returned the first cd because it skipped. Unfortunately,  the replacement skipped, too. The cd is great, but this production run must have had a problem.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I immersed myself in this book during my vacation as it turned out to be a suspense filled page turner. My initial frustration with her naiveté, lack of forethought and preparation, soon gave way to an enormous appreciation of her sheer stick-to-itness and courage. I looked forward to finding out the next thing she encountered and faced down. The description of her toe pain made me cringe, the pain was vivid. The various trekkers and odd fellows she encountered I, at first, went dark on their intentions, and like the author was surprised at the outcome. The ability to overcome and be patient because we may not know now what it all means , but we will in the sweet by-in-by was the greatest lesson I took from the book.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|Got this as a FAOTD. I want a refund. I admit I'm no programmer but if your game consists entirely of matching rows of colored blocks, and your game can't detect matching rows of colored blocks, how do you spin that as anything other than complete failure?<br />Unless and until an update makes this playable, do yourselves a favor and pass.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I try to do the workout everyday, but it's closer to every other day.  I started Beyonddiet.com at the same time and I have lost 7 lbs in a month and my body is totally transforming.  At the beginning, I couldn't finish level 1 in one session, once I felt good getting all the way through level 1 I started level 2.  I couldn't finish level 2 the first few times, so I would alternate levels 1 and 2.  Now, I can complete level 2.  Once I get good at all 3 I will start doing two levels in a row.  I highly recommend this video series no matter your fitness level.  She has an amazing ability to get you to keep pushing yourself even though she's on the TV.
