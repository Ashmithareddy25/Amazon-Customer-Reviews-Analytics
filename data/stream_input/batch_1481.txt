B0086700CM|4.0|temple run is a new game on the kindle fire and it very enjoyable. sometimes it doesn't do exactly what you want it to. but every game has a defect. nothing is perfect but this game is close!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love games where you collect money and up grade it but was by far one of the best games I have ever played they should make number 2
0817439390|5.0|This is a great book, great buy at this price as well. The photos are superb (duh) and leave you inspired to learn! The author's style of writing is very easy to follow and has a jovial, non-daunting tone. highly recommend this as a learning tool. I'm only part-way through, but have found it easy to follow along with the \\"assignments\\".
0307472590|5.0|Esta novela me encanto, la recomiendo mucho es hermosa. La historia cada uno de sus personajes y lo que van viviendo a través del libro. Tanto me gusto que ya leí, El Juego del Ángel, y ahora estoy empezando a leer El Prisionero del Cielo. Excelentes Novelas.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Seriously, this show is not at all what you would expect. Yes it has two hunky guys as main characters and ridiculous sounding plots. However, it is not a teeny show like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It goes through common urban legends, myths etc with an awesomely compelling plot with a story line depth that connects you to the characters. I am not a gore movie or horror fan. I was turned on to this but my BFF and her room mate who talked about it constantly.<br /><br />In all seriousness this show really has some of the BEST acting EVER on a TV program. The way the stories are written the characters can go from polar opposites at any moment and all the actors do it well.<br /><br />Misha (Castiel the angel) is an AMAZING addition to the crew. I think i like him the most, even though I adore Sam and Dean. I hope they keep him around for a very long time!! <3
0345803485|4.0|Yes, the writing is downright painful, and the use of the same terms and expressions over and over gets pretty annoying! However, don't open this book expecting a piece of quality literature and you'll love the crazy, ridiculous, sexy, love story. I took this book with me during my week-long beach trip with my girlfriends and could not put it down. We all giggled together as I read some of the story out loud. I ended up reading all three books! This isn't the best book I've read, but it was entertaining and like I said, a perfect beach read!
B0086700CM|5.0|Its a really awesome game no doubt. No one should have any reason to hats it. Runs smooth &amp; fast on my kindle fire and its fun!
B0086700CM|5.0|&hearts;This game is soooooo much fun! I absolutley loved this game when I played it on my friends ipod for the first time! I was ecstatic when my friend was like &quot;Hey, is that Temple Run?&quot; when I was at the app store. It was in the &quot;bestsellers&quot;&hearts;
B0063IH60K|5.0|Play this on my Kindle all the time.  love it!  Ads are annoying but hey it's free so can't complain too much. a lot of fun.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|The display is laid out nicely. It is one of the few that have a 7-day display option in columns, which I find MUCH superior to the sections of a page layout on most. The gradient used on each cell is not only pleasing to look at, but also makes it easier to quickly see the appointments. Having all the calendars at the bottom is nice.  The only thing missing is the Tasks.  On the Desktop version at my home & office computers, you can list tasks for that day at the top of each day in the 7-day view---This would be nice.  All-Day Activities are shown vertically going down through whole day.  In some ways it makes it easy to see, but clutters the small cells.  I think I prefer it across the top.  A bit hard to see small print w/my aging eyes & no way to expand.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|What a waste....third book got repetetive and boring and the ending was horrible!  Should have been two books max.  Was only interesting because its been a while since Judy Blume wrote Wifey.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Here in Florida the weather can change fast - this app shows the entire state on startup - gives me the big picture.
B0086700CM|5.0|Im a little angry that Imangi Studios have taken so long to add temple run to kindle fire but others its great. After all its the infamous temple run! Who ever doesnt like it really loves being a troll....
B0009A21R6|5.0|The SACD layer on the hybrid disc sounds incredible with clarity and detail I've never heard on these well-known songs.  The surround mix is very well done and sounds natural, improving on the music rather than being awkward or distracting.<br /><br />The CD layer is fine too.  I had no trouble \\"ripping\\" the music into iTunes for portable enjoyment.<br /><br />If I could change one thing, I'd also include the shorter and more familiar radio/single edit of \\"Money for Nothing\\".  The album version is great, but 8:26 is a long time for a song when you're on the go as opposed to just listening to the album.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very pleased and would recommend this disc especially for those with an SACD player.
B0086700CM|5.0|I freaking LOVE this game! I played it on my Ipod and could not wait for it to be on here!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved this book, was sorry to see it end.  Suzanne Collins does a great job moving the story line along and keeping you on your toes.  Quick read and very exciting.
B0086700CM|5.0|AWESOME  GAME  i have it on my ipod touch and wanted it for my kindle fire and now i finally can get it  PLUS ITS FREE!!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I decided to buy the electronic version instead of going to the book store and it was much cheaper.  I loved the book.  It was exciting and a quick read.  This book had so many twists and turns that I really didn't see coming.  On to the third book...
B0086700CM|5.0|have been waiting for months for it to come out!! luv the game! luv it luv it luv it!! cant stop playing yay!
B00005JKLZ|5.0|This is one of those very rare cases where I actually like the remake more than the original. I must say, however, that the original from 1960 ([[ASIN:B0045HCJSA Time Machine]]) was excellent. I love the theory of time travel - the concept fascinates me - and I don't often find a movie about time travel that I do not enjoy. May I also recommend [[ASIN:B001Q2U5B0 The Butterfly Effect]], [[ASIN:B00023BM66 Time Quest]], [[ASIN:6305882525 Dead Again]], [[ASIN:B0009G3B0G The Jacket]], and [[ASIN:B00004W46I Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)]]? Honorable mention to [[ASIN:B000K8EQ5W The Lake House]].<br /><br />Anyway, I really love this movie. I am surprised that Guy Pearce has not become more famous after his starring role in this one. I've seen him now and then but not much. To begin with, the song that's played during the menu (and various times throughout the film) is just beautiful. The movie gets off to a different start than the original. I don't know that Professor Hartdegen (Pearce) really needed a motive for inventing time travel (as curiosity was enough for the first movie), but it worked in this case.<br /><br />I thought it was very ambitious of the movie to travel only 30 years into the future (as of the date of the movie, not the professor's time). Pretty much all of us who enjoyed the movie will still be around then to see how accurate or how far off base they were! (It's only 18 years away now!) Although, I have to say it was nice to see a cleaner, friendlier New York where everyone was walking or riding bikes. And then a measly 7 years later when we dumb humans blew up the moon. Sigh. Will we never learn? Hopefully.<br /><br />Normally, I scorn the fact that movies these days overdo the special effects at the expense of plot and acting. Especially when it is a remake. ([[ASIN:B000E6ESEY Planet of the Apes: The Legacy Collection (Planet of the Apes / Beneath the / Escape from the / Conquest of the / Battle for the)]], for example, is one of my favorite films of all time. The remake was OK, but really kind of pointless.) The Time Machine, sadly, does overdo some of the special effects. The actual machine, for example, was so simple and beautiful in the original. Here it was often hidden behind a big blue space bubble, for lack of a better description. And the Morlocks... They definitely looked more realistic, but I think they could have done it with make-up instead of going overboard and \\"needing\\" 3 puppeteers to animate each face! Then, the actors playing the Morlocks could have even used their own eyeballs instead of looking out of a limited-view camera in the fake face's nose! But I felt that the acting still had merit and the movie on a whole was still amazing, so I could overlook the fact that they got a little carried away with the new technology available to them (10 years ago yet, since I'm writing this in 2012). However, I did love watching the landscape change over the millenniums. That was some fascinating artwork.<br /><br />There were flaws, of course. The language in particular bothered me. Would the language change for a race of people who stayed in one area? I don't know. But I do know that if they learned English but didn't use it, they couldn't just start speaking it out of nowhere. (I feel qualified to say this because I have studied 4 languages and it is not easy.) And just what did \\"quinn\\" mean? They used that an awful lot. And I am confused about the moon. Wouldn't a streaky moon instead of a round moon change the orbit of the Earth or something? But the biggest problem I had was the \\"answer\\" Prof. Hartdegen finally got in the end, from the Morlock with the over-sized brain. Oh, so smart! The thing is, he DID change the past, even if it was not in the way he wanted. The guy who drove the carriage that hit his girl now had to live with guilt. And the thug in the park may have hurt someone else. So much you could analyze, and the Uber-Morlock's answer was way too simplistic. After all, he DID travel through time, so it WAS possible!<br /><br />The reason I like this better than the original (just a bit) is simply because I found the continuous narration in the original a bit tiring, and a bit distracting. And frankly, I liked the Eloi better in this version. They were not as dumbed-down. And while they accepted what was happening to them and didn't fight back, at least they cared about each other.<br /><br />So here is my personal opinion about time travel: it is not possible. I think if it were ever going to be possible, it would have always been possible, or at least we would have always known about it, because we would have been visited by people from the future. And that is something that even the government couldn't have kept secret. But it's just as well, because it wouldn't be a good idea anyway. That's especially apparent in movies like The Butterfly Effect. Just for observation, it might be fun.D travel through time, so it WAS possible!<br /><br />The reason I like this better than the original (just a bit) is simply because I found the continuous narration in the original a bit tiring, and a bit distracting.

B0086700CM|5.0|I heard about this game from other people and I just knew I had to play it and I love it!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a great read!!  Loved every minute of it.  It was a little riske at first but then the author has a way of making you feel comfortable with the context.  Great story line.  Couldn't wait to purchase book 2, then 3!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After many several hundred 5 star ratings, no need to add much more...just adding another 5 star.  Good solid sci-fi story.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple goes hard I have played this game on my ipod science it came out. its awesome if you haven't played it your missing out.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fast pace keeps it interesting.. there is always something to do! However... I can see how it might get overwhelming once the quests start piling up.. and if it gets to where you have start hugging your friends for help every 5 minutes. then I am out. Just started this last night so time will tell!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. you should definitely buy... worth the freeness... I like how it is bigger on the kindle.
B0063GORYU|5.0|A Card Classic ... Exactly as expected... smooth play and a great time killer.  Highly reccomended. Not bad for free!!

B0086700CM|4.0|I have been wanted temble run on the kindle fire for months! now tht it is here I don't read!
B0079K4WMG|4.0|A story about virus that takes away your senses seems a little corny perhaps but this film is anything but that. It has great performances from both leads and some great cinematography. I don't think the film had a big budget but you can't tell as they used their money very well to make a great atmospheric film. You can feel the depression in every frame as society tries to cope as they lose their senses one by one. The main love story between Eva Green and Ewen Mcgregor is well done and realistic. It's not the corny type love affair in some films. It feels real and natural and the two have great chemistry on screen. The ending may not please all but I thought it was a brilliant closing scene. I find myself thinking about the film far after I watched it which is quite rare for me. I recommend this to fans of either apocalyptic end of the world or romance dramas as it is equal parts both.
0345803485|5.0|GREAT read. Recommended for mature readers. I read this book in a day. Blew through book2 now waiting to get book3.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it is an awesome game sooooo addicting i loveeeeee it i would highly recomend it it is awesomeeeeee i loveeee it toot i said toot!!!!! wheeeee

B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a fun running game that is very fun and addicting. Also I liked how you can change your person and get upgrades, I urge you to buy this awesome game.
0811879542|5.0|I purchased this book last week and all I can say is \\"How on EARTH did it take me so long to discover it?\\". It is the most enjoyable book I have read with children for a very long time. Such a clever concept & fun read!<br />I was primarily reading this book to 3 and 4 year old children who were completely engaged and were ready to hear it over and over again (and I mean 6 times was not enough!!)<br />I also read it to children aged 18 months + and though they did not understand the whole concept of the book they were happy to 'press the buttons' with enjoyment too. 6-8 year old's (reading it on their own) were just as fascinated with the concept as well and though it took them until the middle of the book to figure out what was going on, it only captured their interest & prompted them to immediately read it again with full comprehension!<br />Would recommend it to children ages 2+.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|gotta love weird ninjas ,and fighting zombies. it has good graphics and awesome play. wish it had some more fighting options.
1416550550|5.0|Spanning several generations, the story of THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN weaves the reader through years of family secrets as heartaches and mysteries unfold. A little girl is abandoned on a ship bound for Australia in 1913, her English heritage forgotten until the truth slowly unravels. She lives her life with only part of the mystery solved, and leaves the startling conclusion for her beloved granddaughter to discover.<br /><br />Family secrets, an authoress, fairy tales with untold depth, the rugged beauty of Cornwall, England and the journey of self-discovery are magically intertwined in this glorious adventure. I know it's been a good book when I find myself physically aching for the characters as I turn the final page!
B007LYB0PC|5.0|Jake White has taken all that was great about the White Stripes and expanded on it thru the use of a complete band.  His best effort to date!
B001TZQITM|5.0|This bag holds my Nikon AW100 camera with thick neoprene camera strap attached, the charger, an extra battery, extra SD cards, lens wipes and cleaning cloth. this small bag holds everything I need. It's well made and easy to carry.<br /><br />I like the molded bottom and \\"hammock\\" that holds the camera suspended. All in all, a well made bag.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game.It is awsome.I would get this app.you will get a lot of free and awesome games.you will love this app.
B00846REIS|4.0|Great book!!  Got lost in the character's loved the story line cannot wait for the follow up!! So very easy to read if you love a good love story with some spice you will love this book.
B00846REIS|4.0|I read all 3 of the Fifty Shades of Grey books and enjoyed them.  While the characters in both books have their issues, I felt that 50 Shades had a darker tone. Sylvia Day puts her story together in a way that draws the reader in and keeps you interested.  Like most books there are a few outlandish moments.  I've never had anyone walk up to me out of the blue and ask me if I'm currently sleeping with anyone but it might happen to someone.  Eva is a more grounded character with more backbone than the heroine in 50 and easier to like.  Gideon is taken with her from the start and pursues her relentlessly. This book goes into the emotional/psychological issues that Eva has and I hope Deeper in You will also address what happened in Gideon's past that shaped his personality.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|it's pretty cool except when you run out of energy to do stuff :D and I hats waiting to collect money from buildings,  but I'm always on so add me to your mafia!
B007O4XX6S|4.0|Well I can't speak much for the overproduction like the other reviewer.  Perhaps many albums are starting to go this way unfortunately, none as bad as Coldplay's Mylo Xylo.  But the music itself shines, one of Joe's best in many years!  The title song could easily become classic Joe Walsh song like many others he's done.  I also like Lucky That Way (nice country feel), Band Played On, Family, the highly influenced Jeff Lynn One Day At A Time, he spills out a lot about himself and his new found prospective on life (sobriety, God, living one day at a time) which is almost certainly his experiences in his 12 step program!  There are a few clunkers not every song is great but overall I think Jeff did a good job producing the CD and making it a better CD than his last few for sure.  Jeff has done a great job for a lot of artists and this although maybe not his best, a GOOD job indeed!  At this point in the game it's nice to buy a new Joe Walsh CD that's actually listenable and has some great tracks.  inspiration doesn't last forever, sometimes it's lost, and than gets found again!  :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought the book for summer reading. It's so good I can't, put it down.  I look forward to reading the next book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it! definatley recommend it!.so fun and addicting when you have nothing better to do!. I rate it 5 stars!

B0086700CM|5.0|I had never played Temple Run until it became available for the Kindle Fire, so I wasn't among those anxiously waiting for its release. Now that I have it, though, I would recommend it to anyone. It's fast-paced, fun, and addicting. The graphics are great, the controls are easy, and the game play is ever-changing.
B0007KS7D0|3.0|With the camera I have you have to have a closeup filter of some sort due to its 4.3mm wide angle lens when no zoom is used. The macro setting is no help in this camera due to this wide angle lens.    I have a Cannon sx40hs camera which has a 52mm lens with a 35x zoom and I must use an add on 67mm adapter for filters. The Raynox lens is a 49mm lens and even though the spring fitting will work with a 67mm threaded surface it still has the problem of a circle. With my zoom lens I must zoom out quite a distance to get rid of the circle effect and even then it does not seem to get rid of it completely. I sent it back and bought a lens like the Raynox, that is one which is an achromatic doublet, but it was designed for a 67mm housing only so the lens is larger and I have to zoom out much less to get rid of the circle. It was also less expensive.  The Raynox lens is a good one but not for my situation.    \\" [...] \\"
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is a lot of fun!! In the long run you might have to pay for something but right now its really cool!! Great graphics, cool quests, and you get to watch clips from the new movie!
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple run-I like it. The game is very addictave.When I play the app,I can't stop.Temple Run is a fun game and I recomend the app to any age group.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love the huger games books. Keeps your attention going and leaves you wanting more. The only disappointment is that this series stops at three books.

B007SGM084|1.0|With Prime the paperback trilogy is $6 cheaper than the digital version.  Something is very wrong here!!  Way to stick it to the consumer.
B001D1SRRS|5.0|I purchased this book while enrolled in a Total Quality Management course. It is a solid study on how the automobile revolutionized the study and execution of quality assurance. I highly recommend it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much although some of it is sad, the humor helps the plot and I love that it is a dog telling the story!  It's a fast read, too!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This is a very good puzzle app that does Hanjie puzzles at all different levels. My only complaint is that sometimes moving the puzzle it inadvertantly enters moves.
B0086700CM|5.0|yes yes yes they got it :) now they need design this home im sooo exicited to play this game
B007NYO74Q|3.0|Between the words \\"razor-sharp\\" and \\"comedy\\" the words \\"VERY DARK\\" should be included in the description of this film.  The acting is generally terrific but I was all set for a comedy and found myself being brought down so thoroughly that I started thinking about all the ways Harold tried to kill himself before meeting Maude...NOT a \\"light\\" topic at all; each person brought enough baggage to overflow the room on the screen, as well as the room where I sat observing the massacre...if you're happy, and you know it, and you want to change that about you,watch this film!
B0086700CM|5.0|I like pie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />do you like pie I like pie. yay for pie. pie keeps earth in the suns orbit. without pie I would implode then explode. that's why we need to have pie week not pie day. no pie month. no pie year. huh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! pie eternity!

B004EBT5CU|5.0|ADELE 21 or should I say Coming of age. Giving this disc several second take spins, I came away more impressed than originally. I hear the depth, sincerity and a bit more maturity in all the tracks, the more I listen to ADELE 21. Some of the performances are downright haunting. It definitely grew on me.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|This movie goes onto my list of favorites. Liam Nelson provides a phenomenal performance and a very realistic side of human beings under great pressure is exposed in the movie. The situations created are realistic and keep you on the edge of your seat for the better part of this film. It also contains a surprisingly philosophical view that some will agree with and others will not. The one thing that limits this movie from being 5 stars? The use of the F- word. I understand under pressure people swear but the level in this movie was nothing short of unnecessary. It might add to the movie, but after the 90th time of hearing it... you get the picture.<br /><br />READ THIS PART IF NOTHING ELSE.<br />Many say the ending was horrible (I watched it with friends, when it ended we all literally yelled), but we happened to keep it on through the credits. AFTER THE CREDITS THERE IS (about) A 2 SECOND SCEENE. WATCH IT. I happened to draw a parallel between this scene and an earlier one that gave me a whole other understanding of the end of this film.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally waited forever........I have this on my iphone 4s and ipod just needed it on the kindle fire thank God!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just love all the books to the series.  Love the author.  I hope that she writes a fouth one, if not a new series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As the book begins it takes you to a world that seems unbelievable but as you read on and the Hunger Games begin Katniss Everdeen shows light on the propaganda and cruelty that is enforced by the Capital. The Hunger games takes one on an adventure through the emotions and limitations of love, fear and desperation. It shows worlds of need and starvation to a world of gluttony and surplus. In a sense this trilogy is on the same lines as George Orwell's Animal Farm and is a good read for all age classes. It truly is our modern day version of a classic. Its a book you will find difficult to put down and will transfix any one of any age. After reading The Hunger Games you will find it difficult not to carry on to the the next two books in the trilogy. A must read on all accounts!![[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]]

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was never a big fan of Stephen King books. I think I maybe read 2 of them. Honestly, I had nothing against him as an author, I was just too scared of his books! I'm not someone who likes horror stories, but this is not one of them (aside from a couple of mildly violent scenes). But, someone in my book club recommended this book and I decided to try it out. Yes, the length of this behemoth book scared me. But, once I started, I couldn't stop. _11/22/63_  is one of the greatest books I've ever read. I couldn't put it down. I found myself going to YouTube to watch videos about the Kennedy assassination - such a horrific event in our nation's history. But, this book isn't just about that. It's beautifully written story with intriguing characters, a fascinating and creative plot disguised with an underlying, tender love story. I'm also a high school teacher, so I can appreciate some of Jake/George's interactions with his students. I thought the ending was PERFECT - tender and beautiful. This goes on my favorite-books-of-all-time list. I'm sad it's over.

B0081KTI0E|1.0|Only the very beginning got my attention, after that with the film's minimal dialogue, very sloooow pace, unsuspenseful direction, and the annoying<br />time-consuming camera shots of Radcliffe's expressionless face. (See the photo of the DVD, that's the face he holds throughout the movie, except when he speaks) No scares, no suspense, no connection to characters.  One of the most boring ghost movies I have ever spent time viewing (result=dozing off).
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Wow this takes me back I grew up playing all the gaming stations Atari ,NES, Sega 16 bit, super NES, Nintendo 64 and forward this is just like Super Mario Bros. and works well but I wish you could go down the tree trunks like the tubes in Mario Bros. All in all its been very fun to play.
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|Just a thought, but all the action films with leading ladies, there's always a majority of negative reviews. I liked watching this new action star.  She's what held my interest. I'm not familiar with MMA fighting style before viewing, so I didn't have any expectations.  Acting wise, I'm sure she did her best, just like Stallone and Schwarzenegger did.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This CD is a strong rock music CD with very powerful lryics to every song on it.  If you are ever feeling down, hurt, left out and so forth then get this CD and listen to the lryics because they will impact you as much as they did me as I listen to the CD.  I do have my favorites off it they include Pain, Animal I have Become, Riot, and Get out Alive. But the whole album is amazing start to finish so if you have a passion for rock music like me then pick this up and sit back and enjoy hard rock music with passionate lryics behind each song.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is awesome and I love to play ot on my computer and now I can play it on the go!
B000001EMW|5.0|I bought this CD to see if they could pull it off because Metallica is my favorite band. I have to admit I was very amazed at this band and what they could do with the Cellos.  Plus they choice all the Metallica music I enjoy listening to over and over again.  So if have an open mind to new style of music then pick this CD up and listen to it and be prepared to be amazed at what this band can do.  They have yet to fall in my veiwpoint they keep it comming time after time.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|awesome game, but I downloaded it free from the Google Play store.  Not sure why one had it free and the other doesn't.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|A few weeks ago, when I got really sick, I decided to give [[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]] a try. Sure, it's young adult literature (so is Harry Potter, actually) and some of the comments I'd heard vilified its bad use of punctuation, but the general hype and mostly positive reviews convinced me to give it a try.<br /><br />And if you haven't yet, you should too.<br /><br />If you haven't heard about the books yet, here is a very short summary of what they are about (or you can always just watch the movie trailer).<br /><br />  In the country of Panem, every year there is a \\"reaping\\", where one male and one female between 12 and 18 are randomly chosen in each of the 12 districts to participate in the Hunger games, a sadistic game of survival where the last person alive wins comfort for themselves and glory for their district.<br /><br />  Katniss Everdeen lives in the poorest district, #12, that relies on coal mining. In order to save her younger sister from the reaping, she volunteers to participate in the Hunger Games along with Peeta, the baker's son. From this fateful decision begins an adventure that will bring Katniss to the heart of Panem politics, and involve her in a plot to overturn the dictatorship of the Capitol.<br /><br />I have a soft spot for science-fiction. I may have studied Victorian literature, but I admire the ability of science fiction to imagine whole new social systems and technologies and turn them into believable worlds. I will break my review down in three parts for each book.<br /><br />Book 1: The Hunger Games<br /><br />It didn't take very long for the story to grip me. The dystopian world, the sympathetic characters, the quick-moving plot: everything works to make this book in a page-turner.<br /><br />We meet Katniss as she prepares for hunting in the woods, which is illegal  but widely accepted by the authorities of the district, as they also gain from it. Katniss is responsible for her mother and her little sister, Prim, since her mother suffered a breakdown after the death of her father. She hunts with Gale, her best friend, and they share skills and resources to feed both their families.<br /><br />The book begins a few days before the Reaping. We get Katniss' point of view as she reflects on the consequences of the reaping and its injustice. At their core, the Hunger Games are a version of Roman gladiator shows: a way to control the outer provinces and provide entertainment to a blas&eacute;, luxurious capital population. In the book, the history of the Hunger Games begins with a war, after which the Hunger Games are implemented to \\"remind\\" the people, every year, of the Capitol's power over them. Attendance to the reaping is mandatory, and so is watching the Games. Think \\"Gladiator\\" meets \\"Big Brother\\" in a dictatorship.<br /><br />I felt instant sympathy for Katniss. In a world where living illegally is the only way to eat enough, where social injustice is rampant (and in fact institutionalized) and where children are held hostage against rebellion, her struggle to act morally despite the cruelty around her is heroic.<br /><br />As soon as the Games start, the plot picks up its pace and keeps you turning the pages all the way to the end. Her true/fake love affair with Peeta, which keeps both of them alive, is particularly fraught with teenage anxiety around relationships and desire. But ultimately, this is about survival. Who do you live for? What are you willing to do to survive?<br /><br />The writing, despite its slight faults, is gripping and evocative. Collins has a way to describe horrific scenes in a way that retains the violence, but maintains respect for the human victims. The book left me hungry for more.<br /><br />Book 2: Catching Fire<br /><br />Given the way the story of The Hunger Games ended, it was obvious that a second part was in Collin's mind. The second book explores Panem society a bit more in depth, and still includes everyone's favourite part, another round of Hunger Games.<br /><br />The book begins as Katniss and Peeta get ready to go on the customary Panem-wide winner's tour. They are paraded throughout the country to, mostly, twist the knife into the wound of all the losing districts. But she also realizes that her act of defiance against the Capitol has spurred a spirit of rebellion in Panem. Ambivalent as to her involvement and desire to be part of such a difficult entreprise, Katniss is ready to move on to a more peaceful and wealthy life in her District. But a forced wedding between herself and Peeta forces her to remain in the spotlight, until the new round of Hunger Games are announced, with all the rules changed. Katniss and Peeta are forced to participate in the Games, once again.<br /><br />In Catching Fire, the main focus is Katniss' growing anxiety at her feelings for both Peeta and Gale. Collins artfully captures the flightiness of teenage desire, which remains constant despite a world torn by trauma and pseudo-slavery. In this second round, the rules of the game also change drastically, increasing Katniss' sense of loss of control over her life.<br /><br />Although there is less attention given to the actual Games in this book, we are given ample time to see Katniss suffer from PTSD. I think that Collins' depiction of the effect of PTSD on teenagers, which she deepens in Mockingjay, is the highlight of this book. Katniss' heroic act from The Hunger Games takes its toll, and Collins has no problem depicting her heroine as capable of breaking down and being weak.<br /><br />The writing also gets better in Catching Fire. Collins shows a stronger mastery of the craft and, while still addressing teenagers, is capable of drawing in adults on her own merits. The senselessness of violence and the consequences of repeated trauma are definitely major concerns of Catching Fire.<br /><br />My only gripe with this book: I wish I had learned more about Panem society. Collins kind of opens up the topic by providing an interesting description of one district, and then drops it completely. We do learn from other districts through their competitors in the Games, but it really isn't the same. Somehow I was expecting something a bit more complex, but Collins decided to keep the focus on Katniss herself rather than expand the world she so convincingly sketches, even if lightly.<br /><br />Book 3: Mockingjay<br /><br />This is where I started losing my interest a bit. This book reminded me of Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe, in that the main character, supposedly the heroine, spends most of the book disabled by PTSD  and medication. Even though the final heroic act is hers again, it's hard to see her as the strong character in this last installment. She spends most of her time in a medical haze, or crying, or hiding in a closet.<br /><br />Katniss, now living in discreet, long-lost District 13, has to deal with the trauma of two Hunger Games and the weight of the liberation of Panem on her shoulders. Through her actions in the first book, she has become a symbol of rebellion used to rally the Districts against the Capitol. Much less happens in this third book than in the first two. There are a few battle scenes, and the final one, but otherwise, this book is much more introspective than the other two.<br /><br />But at the same time, this book is among the strongest example of the mental and physical consequences of war and violence on people. It is introspective because Katniss has reached her breaking point. She is exhausted, emotionally and physically, and cannot sustain more trauma. So the book becomes not so much about the liberation of Panem, but about Katniss' eventual, slow liberation from PTSD.<br /><br />The end, although satisfying on a character level, left me wanting on the world-level. We don't know what has happened to Panem, in the end. Is is better for Katniss' intervention, or has it remained the same? I think we're supposed to make a link between Katniss' and Panem's healing, but it's not as obvious as it should be.<br /><br />General thoughts<br /><br />These books are rough. Brutal. They don't pull punches and describe war and violence without euphemisms. It's refreshing, in a sense, because it stands in stark contrast with the official-speak so condemned by George Orwell, back in the day. Collins, I'm sure, sees teenagers as able to handle the truth. She doesn't sugar-coat the horrifying acts of violence in both Games and the war.<br /><br />Although the books do live up to their hype, somehow, they don't live up to their potential. The world of Panem deserved much more development than it did. Maybe it's the fan of complex fictional social systems, &agrave; la Middlemarch, in me speaking, but I do think that the world of Panem could have been the site for a much deeper critique of the current state of power and capitalism. It's dystopian-we get it. But how did it become that way? What happened between now and then that the site of American power moved to possibly Colorado (I suspect Denver) and its social structure turned back to medieval times? I've read a lot of anticipatory science-fiction that gave enough information to infer how the world might crumble. Not so with The Hunger Games.<br /><br />All in all, it was a mostly satisfying read. It took me 3 days to read all of them, which makes them a quick and entertaining read. And I must admit I did cry at the end (or that might have been how tired and sick I felt. You'll never know, hah :p). My desire for a more complex world aside, considering the audience, I thought they were excellent examples of what the best YA literature can do.providing an interesting description of one district, and then drops it completely.

159514188X|4.0|Wow. This book is very intense. This is the story of a girl who killed herself and left her story behind on tapes for people to hear. This book is very intense and graphic at times. I wouldn't say I enjoyed this book, because it is hard to enjoy a book about suicide. But it definitely touched me and was a very emotional book. I think this is a great book for everyone to read. Unfortunately, suicide has become fairly common in the world today and it is up to us to stop our friends or acquaintances from killing themselves. This book really shows how she had been basically crying out for help but no one realized it and took the time to help her. Very intense, but very good book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'be been waiting forever for this to come out on the kindle fire!!!! I love it! I could play for endless hours!!!! :)
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Simply amazing. I was already a big George Harrison fan but this took my love for him to a whole new level. This is a must see.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a well written book with vivid characters and a few side characters I'd like to see a bit more about. The story focuses an Katnis and Peeta: the rest of the characters arn't really well fleshed out, which moves the story along quickly. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the other characters are \\"Cardboard.\\" There just isn't a lot of info on them.<br /><br />I see numerous other reviews with in depth plot explanations, so I won't go there on this book. I will try and give food for thought about other aspects of this book.<br /><br />This is definitely a TEEN book: written to appeal the the TEEN audience by making the main characters between the ages of 12-18. That is the only reason this book didn't get 5 stars from me. I feel the book lost many points on credibly trying to market to a younger audience - at least with me it cost them a star.<br /><br />Ask yourself this - if you were making people fight to the death, would you throw 12 year-olds into the mix? Even the Roman games had adults in them, not children. Also, which 16 year old could be plucked up out of a 3rd world country and brought into a lavish, ultra-modern, high-tech world, thrown on stage and be well composed or well spoken? Out of 24 I'd say maybe one or two could manage to make a complete sentence in front of thousands of people. The author did a good job of portraying this with Katnis, but she was supposed to be having more difficulty with the live appearance then the other contestants. You would think she would have been the norm.<br /><br />One last side note... Peeta.... LOL great name choice and a real play on words, considering the other books! Ever heard of a PITA? Pain in the As... (rear)
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is another of the wonderful Doctor Who sonic screwdrivers. The fragile nature of the plastic leads me to warn that they are not really toys for children. They are toys for adults! This one comes with a UV light, a standard pen nib, and an \\"invisible ink\\" nib which requires the application of the UV light in order to read whatever message you may write. And of course it has the authentic sound effect when activated. A great gift for any Doctor Who fan, or just treat yourself!
0307951529|5.0|As the instructor of the \\"First Steps for Starting a Business\\" at UW-Madison's Small Business Development Center, I absolutely must recommend Chris Guillebeau's \\"the $100 Start-Up\\".  This book tells you exactly how you can create a good income by transforming your ideas into an enterprise.  Chris provides the reader with a step by step process to start up a small business utilizing the power of social media, relationship marketing and the internet.<br /><br />Sprinkled with humorous illustrations, inspiring quotes and success stories, this book is a fun read.  Each chapter concludes with a summary block of key points which I found to be incredibly helpful.  In addition, the author generously provides downloadable worksheets from his website, 100startup.com to support readers on their entrepreneurial journey.<br /><br />I had the good fortune to meet Chris recently at a book signing in Milwaukee.  He's the real deal!  Sincere, humble and charged with purpose, he has \\"walked the walk\\" and turned his own passion for traveling and writing into an incredibly successful business.  Between his \\"the Art of Nonconformity\\" website and this book, his words positively impact not just entrepreneurial wannabes, but everyone who is seeking an alternative to the 8 to late full time job.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love tjis game it is the best game ever i recommend this game to anyone who likes jumping running and going under things collecting treasure
B007EC6FIS|5.0|Wow!<br />If you're a fan of Keane & have heard their previous albums, they're great but they're mostly somber & emotional.  While this album still has some of the signature 'Keane' somber lyrics, the music has definitely seen an uptik in mood.  This is a very enjoyable album with very well-written songs - both musically & lyrically.<br /><br />As far as the recording quality goes - this is top notch.  The quality of the recording sounds far better than their previous albums.<br /><br />One of my favorite features: they've (as they've done with their previous albums) continued to include the lyrics on the album insert.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they've moved to a cardstock case instead of the classic jewel case, but I suppose it's the \\"green\\" thing to do....<br /><br />I'm a long-time Keane fan & am very pleased with this album - you should give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.
B005XRU62C|4.0|Awsome album can't wait to buy more of her music very powerfull voice and band great album to buy if you like female singers
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|I love the look of Weathertop But The price 60 bucks is a bit much. I mean the Uruk Hai Army Set is half the Price and doesn't have anything interesting going for it. I wish the good folks at Lego would cut the price in half because sets like Mines of Moria and Helms deep deserve the expensive Price.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am high school teacher who teaches literature and I have never bought an edification book before.  With that said I rather enjoyed the book.  It is intriguing and leaves the reader wanting to know and learn more about Christian and what makes him tick.  Having said that the sexual experiences were a little shocking but pleasureble thinking about the possibilities.  I disagree with the poor reviews it is obvious they have not been introduced to all types of literature.  For me the author did a great job she kept my attention and wanting more.  The whole purpose of literature is to introduce people to something new which she did.  Awesome book and I am looking forward to reading the others.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This movie is one of THE BEST movies EVER! It's right up there with Spirited Away and all the Greats!<br />This is the kind of movie where by the time you watched it three times in a row your still not tired of watching it!<br /><br />Oz is a huge global network that the whole world relys on to manage their daily lives, but when our hero Kenji a part time maintence worker for the program gets a code email while at the girl of his dreams Natsuki's family reuinion posing as her fake boyfriend and solves it and without meaning to lets in a AI (designed by Natsuki's uncle for the USA) into the program that is designed to be unstoppable in taking over everyones accounts and the whole program and send the whole world into desiray and eventually starts a count down for all the Nukes on earth to go off, he and Natsuki, her cousin Kazuma, and her Uncle Wabisuke and the rest of her family set off in their techy quest to defeat the AI and save the world!<br /><br />Kenji (the main character) is downright smart, noble, and adorable! The perfect hero! In the end he's the one who kills Love Machine by using his techy skills at the end of the movie saving the entire world from getting nuked.<br /><br />Natsuki (co-main character) is sweet in her own way, full of energy, and confident. The hero who defeats Love Machine in an epic battle intending to kill it but only ending up weakening it greatly but that's when Kenji kills it.<br /><br />Kazuma AKA King Kazma (co-main character) This guy is my favorite character, he is OZ's #1 butt kicking avatar, he's one of the main family members shown in this movie and the main hero battling it off with Love Machine throughout the movie.<br /><br />Natsuki's Grandma (co-main character) One of my favorite characters, she's the head of the family and in the time of the OZ crisis she shows that you don't need to be important to make a differance.<br /><br />Natsuki's family is proud, full of life and togetherness and generally really good naturedpeople, but on the down side they're pregidous against family members who arent technically \\"legitament\\" and blame them for not being so. They're also pregidous against the USA.<br /><br />If you havent bought it by now GO DO SO!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|graphics are a little slow at times on the kindle fire.... but all in all a great way to kill time!!!
B005TBN3EU|2.0|Entertaining enough in certain parts, but most of it felt self-referential, canned, and scripted.  Hope the cast were paid well.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I like how this book expresses a lot of different and intense emotions. The twists and turns of the plot are very strong and because of that the individual nature of the characters become more distinct. It was easy to love certain characters and hate other characters because of how they are portrayed in the story. The family drama, the action, the magic and the controversies of the tribe make this book all-in-one!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun and addicting.  simple enough that it doesn't become frustrating yet difficult enough that you aren't bored. if you don't give it a try your missing out
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If there is one thing that this book left on me, it is a bothered self. A part of me wants them to be together while another part of me wants Christian Grey all for myself. He is very mysterious and I find that very attractive in a man. I can understand Anastasia's desire to straighten out his past but that is what builds up his charm. He is basically what makes the story addictive and engaging.
1466401885|5.0|I loved it! I was automatically sucked in and completely obsessed. I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 days. I literally just finished it. I'm kinda sad it's over. I fell in love with the character. It had me wanting more with every page!

B005HJU7HA|5.0|As an English Lit major, I appreciate the great work of this iconic writer.  A true classic that set the tone and the bar for every mystery writer that followed.  Everyone should have a copy of his work to read and re-read.  No better way to do that than a Kindle, that way it is always at your fingertips.

B001CDWFPC|4.0|I really like the electronic format.  I was not disappointed, but wished there was more in the way of historical notes comparing biblical history with secular history.  That combination helps to add context and provides \\"teachable\\" opportunities when preparing a lecture or discussion.

Yep. Enough said.<br />And later, saving the day as only Mr. Samuel Langhorne Clemens can...well, watch.<br />Oh, and Whoopi Goldberg makes a first appearance. Temporally speaking...
B00003CX95|5.0|From  a  personal  standpoint  this  is  one  of my  all  time  favourite  films. Given  it's  length  at  about  3  hours  it  takes  quite  the  film  to  keep  you  riveted  to  your  seat and  Braveheart  delivers. While  obviously  not  fully  true  to  the  exact  history  of  Scotlands  fight  for  independance  the  film  is  nonetheless  quite  the  sweeping epic  with  intrigue,  battle  scenes  that  are  very  graphic  and  full  of  blood  and  gore. The  film  is  focused  on  the  figure  of  William  Wallace  who  united  the  Scottish  clans  and  inspired  them  in  their  fight  for  freedom  from  England.
B005HEQZLW|5.0|Come on! A Holmesian character traps Picard and others in a holodeck simulation?! Classic.<br />Although I would have sent Data in there to break Professor James Moriarty's neck, being the<br />archenemy and foil of Sherlock Holmes, I'm rather sure Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would not appreciate<br />such a violent and uncharacteristic encounter against the man whom could have extinguished one of<br />literatures great charachters so many a time if not for the pleasure that ensued via the chase.<br />For a while that is...  ~\\"Computer, 'Arch'\\"

B005IQZB14|5.0|A young woman who \\"strayed\\" reinvents herself while hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail.  Cheryl Strayed is a courageous woman with an uncanny ability to evoke emotion through her prose.  In \\"Wild:  From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail,\\" Cheryl bares her soul and reflects on the events in her life that brought her to Oregon and California, where she takes on her past as she solo hikes the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT).  Her journey of discovery appropriately ends at the Bridge of the Gods where she contemplates her future.  Read the book to find out what that future holds.<br /><br />If you are looking, or not looking to read another account of a solo hiker on the PCT, be advised that this one goes beyond the average account.  Be ready to cry while learning about the author's crooked path as she breaks her own heart.  Be ready to be enthralled with colorful and emotional writing from an author with tremendous artistic talent.<br /><br />The author who discovered her true self on a courageous journey is also a talented writer.  If you love good writing, adventures, and the out of doors, don't miss the opportunity to read this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it. jump response can be a little better, but all in all a great game would recommend to everyone I know.
B007SGM084|3.0|This book is a series of sex scenes strung together by a flimsy plot line.  Eventually I even stopped reading the sex scenes as they became repeative and relatively unbelievable.  How many times can you have \\"mind blowing\\" sex?

1451627289|4.0|Im not a regular Steven King reader but loved bag of bones, and had heard such great things about this book that despite the huge page count I bought it to read for our book club. I will admit that it really draws you in and the lead character is very likable and the writing is great as usual, but I felt it was too drawn out and it just lost some steam about half way through and I felt myself skipping paragraphs here and there and just wanting to fast forward to the end. And then....the ending.....I was left so unsatisfied. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it, but I really wanted more.  Some resolution of some of the many loose ends, and the epilogue just wasn't enough.  I would give this 3-1/2 stars if that was possible, because the writing at times was so beautiful and engaging and bonus points for a new and interesting take on time travel and the butterfly effect.  Happy reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|so good! glad it's on the kindle! thanks! I love it! I keep coming back for more! my favorite game!
B005J9ZDYK|3.0|agree with the other reviewer. the animation changed, the charming quirks have gotten more manic. most episodes have a some sort of automotive chase in it. it's like they souped up the animation and lost the commitment to charm, narrative, and quirkiness in favor of hollywood tricks.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game.  It is addicting and hard to put away.  It is great for passing the time when you are waiting at an airport or some other place where it is too distracting or noisy to read.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I can't believe this microphone is so poor. I bought it hoping I could record better videos than using the built-in microphone. Even with the gain turned all the way up I can barely be heard. What is the point of shouting, I had better audio with the camera's built in microphone, on a tripod, several feet away. Do NOT buy this. You will not be happy. I am going to send it back.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is fun. it is good for when you're bored. this is all I have to say. good bye
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Too bad this series didn't last longer. It had a little something for everyone: gunslingers and spaceships, government plots and tarts; action, drama, and comedy. It had good writing and a well-directed, excellent cast. The only bad thing about it is that it ends way too soon. It's a unique and original must-see.
B008469DGY|2.0|Quick pick-up-and-play interface, with good graphics. The problem is that the game is VERY short for the $1.99 price tag. The game gets old fast because there are a limited number of holes, and the scores required to win trophies are way to hard to achieve.  I deleted it after a couple of weeks.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I liked this set and would recommend it for adults and most older adolescents. I do have a caveat: the intense action, insidious threat, and frequent incidents of violence could disturb some readers. There are also numerous political and social themes built into the plot.  Parents should preview so they'll be able to discuss the books with their teens.
B0086700CM|5.0|No ads. Easy controls and very kid friendly. Lots of replay value and cool upgrades. I hope there is a sequel!
0345803493|2.0|Slightly better than the first book. I felt compelled to read it since I stupidly bought all three books at once. Still not impressed.
B005LAIGTG|3.0|The best thing this movie has going for it is the story, the part the writers didn't even come up with on their own.  Most of the major events, including the ending (which I won't give away) are accurate.  The real story that the movie is based upon is already touching and captivating, making it very easy for the writers.  But the creativity stopped there.  Many of the elements in the movie feel tacked on in an effort to give the plot more conflict.  Sam Neill and Jessica Lange give great performances, but unfortunately, their characters aren't believable and seem more like the stereotypical movie villans.<br /><br />The acting by Channing Tatum is just plain disappointing.  I'm not sure what the thinking was behind putting a \\"buff guy\\" in a tender character, but they still could have found a man with muscles AND acting ability.  Rachel McAdams gives a good performance, but it takes more than one good actor to make a good movie.<br /><br />And finally, to leave a bitter feeling in the viewers mouth, the movie seems to end way to early in the story, and you're left wondering \\"That's it?\\"  True, we do want some questions left unanswered, but we still need some sense of closure.<br /><br />Bottom line, even by lame-romance movie standards, The Vow falls short.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm in my 70's and not very familiar with the game of Angry Birds so when I downloaded this selection to my new Kindle Fire I had my granddaughter show me how it works and oh my, what fun we had. I learned how to make the screen smaller in order to see both the targets and how to aim. I learned how to tap the screen and change the speed and velosity of the ammunition and when. Now, when I get bored, I fire up my Kindle Fire and play Angry Birds Rio.

B005LAIHY0|1.0|This twice revised verdict contains A LOT OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />This High Court finds the accused guilty of:<br /><br />1) disappointing the expectations of large numbers of devoted fans and admirers<br />2) soiling his own legacy<br />3) dumping garbage in theatres around the world<br />4) insulting the intelligence of the viewers<br />5) wasting the talent of good actors<br />6) robbing defenceless Engineers of the totality of their &#34;cool&#34; factor<br />7) wagging his 3D in public, in a crowded area, without any valid reason<br />8) using office staples in medicine<br />9) causing waste of perfectly good popcorn in a world where hundreds of millions do not have enough to eat<br /><br />Justification: A LOT was expected from &#34;Prometheus&#34;. It is however the finding of this Court that this film failed to meet the required standards to such a point, that it is at best an average SF film, many quality levels beneath &#34;Alien&#34; and in fact not even as good as &#34;Alien3&#34;... This Court finds particularly reprehensive the fact, that Sir Ridley Scott, one of the greatest directors alive, accepted a piss-poor scenario, which, unlike in his masterpieces (&#34;Alien&#34;, &#34;Blade Runner&#34;, &#34;Blackhawk Down&#34;, etc.) doesn't make any sense. This Court rejects with extreme energy the argument of the defense, that the scenarist is responsible for this film fiasco. The director is the person really in charge of the film and therefore the responsibility is all his, for everything, including the scenario. Also, as the scenarist is currently hiding in his own butt and refuses to come out (understandable under the circumstances), his testimony couldn't be heard - and therefore the whole point is considered moot and irrelevant for the present proceedings.<br /><br />This Court finds particularly offensive to common sense that the whole idea of First Contact with intelligent aliens was wasted and played at the level of a B-class &#34;direct to DVD&#34; SF film. It can be resumed briefly - an intelligent entity, belonging to a race which could fly interstellar spaceships already at least tens of thousands years ago, wakes up and sees smaller creatures, clearly intelligent because they obviously made it out of their solar system. So what does it do? It doesn't even try to communicate, but just starts to rip them apart. This Court allows itself here the right to laugh its (---) off, but with much underlying sadness.<br /><br />As a mitigating circumstance, this Court finds that there is a possibility that this deplorable scene was caused by the android David messing up the communications. The android seems to have learned alien's language from ancient human inscriptions - which certainly did not include phonetics (this is why NOBODY today can say with certainty how the Latin was REALLY spoken). So it may be that what the alien heard from the android was in fact: &#34;I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smells of elderberries&#34;. Which would explain everything... All doubts being considered in favour of the accused, those mitigating circumstances will be duly weighted at the sentencing, below.<br /><br />There can be however no mitigating circumstances concerning another weakness of the scenario, namely the fact that a mission which cost Weyland Corporation a trillion of dollars is manned by a bunch of total IDIOTS! This Court reminds here, that the crew of &#34;Nostromo&#34;, made just of hard working blue collar people, acted with much more logic, caution and discipline than the 17 crew members of &#34;Prometheus&#34;, who are for most part simply pathetic. This Court acknowledges however, that captain Janek, pilot Chance, navigator Ravel and medical officer Ford are - to some extent - exceptions here.<br /><br />In the interest of justice, this Court presents here some most blatant examples of above mentioned idiocy:<br /><br />- you were selected to be part of a trillion dollars interstellar mission - so the first time you see an alien skellington you panic and run like crazy away from others!<br />- you were selected to be part of a trillion dollars interstellar mission, because you are a renowned biologist - so the first time the guy next to you sees an alien skellington, panics and runs away like crazy, you scream like a little girl and run after him, so you can get lost together in a maze of dark underground galleries (even if it is YOU who have the only map)...<br />- on a planet able to support life you find an alien underground complex and the atmosphere is OK! Let's all take off our helmets, so we can inhale all the local bacteria, viruses and other stuff against which we have no immunity!<br />- a living creature, vaguely snakelike, appears and approaches - let's give it our hand immediately, after all this is how we handle cobras and vipers on our planet - and I should know, I am a biologist!<br />- oops, I am contaminated by an alien organism and there are already little tentacles growing out of my eye - as I am an educated person with a PhD, I will not say one word about it, I absolutely want this thing to develop until I can not be saved anymore; also let's contaminate the others, after all, Mum always told me it is nice to share!<br />- a guy who was missing for 24 hours signals his presence at the spaceship entry - let's not even have ONE LOOK at him, like for example to see if it is REALLY him, BEFORE opening the doors!<br />- two of my people are stranded in a weird underground complex and there are signs appearing that there is SOMETHING alive inside. Should I maintain regular contact and keep a careful watch over them until they are recovered? Naah! Let's just get drunk and get laid, they will be surely fine... And anyway there is no manpower for this, there is only 15 people left on board...<br />- last but not least, on a trillion dollar interstellar mission on a planet which can support life (and therefore presence of predators can be expected) the whole arsenal on board consists of one shotgun, one handgun and two little flamethrowers - and therefore at some moments it will be down to knives, axes and wrenches...<br /><br />Idiocy being contagious, it is the finding of this Court that the giant aliens a.k.a. Engineers, also caught it:<br /><br />- I am a supremely intelligent ancient life form; I wake up from cryogenic sleep and see facing me five smaller, but clearly intelligent life forms; because I am evil and aggressive I wish to destroy them; of course it doesn't matter that I am alone here and unarmed, and there may be a hundred other small life forms waiting outside, packing heat; it doesn't matter that there is their whole SPACESHIP somewhere outside, which definitely must be packing REAL heat (if only for its propulsive system and mass); it doesn't matter that for all I know there can be a whole FLEET of spaceships on the orbit - no, I am going after them with my bare hands, without collecting the slightest intelligence, without even trying to find some weapons, maybe wake up some reinforcements. Tens of thousands of years of brilliant intelligence development = charge at sight and fight bare handed!<br />- I am a suppremely intelligent ancient life form and my spaceship was just downed by those pesky small life forms; it appears that one of them is still alive and hiding in a small sized but sophisticated container; I want to kill this life form! Should I find a weapon? Use the equipements of my ship which still function to scan the alien container and check for booby traps or weaponry? Go find another spaceship and use its weaponry to vaporize the intruder? No! The correct answer is to charge blindly towards the alien container, with my bare hands, without even having a look for any possible traps or surprises.<br /><br />This Court admits that the casting was made skilfully, but many actors were underused. Idriss Elba (captain Janek) plays very well a tough and brave man - but his screen time is surprisingly limited! Charlize Theron looks in this film as a goddess - frankly, at some moments this Court almost had the impression that looking at her hurt this Court's eyes, so beautiful she is. Her character (Meredith Vickers, mission supervisor) is IMPRESSIVE - but again, the scenario mostly leaves the lead to others and her part in the second part of the film is especially disappointing. Guy Pearce plays Peter Weyland, the CEO and owner of the redoubtable Weyland Corporation. But Peter Weyland is a venerable, truly ancient old man - and Guy Pearce is not, which forces him to wear SO OBVIOUSLY a silly rubber mask! Why Sir Ridley couldn't hire just an old actor (there must be some in Hollywood), is beyond this Court's ability to understand - and forgive.<br /><br />An even more serious charge concerns messing with elements linking &#34;Prometheus&#34; to &#34;Alien&#34;. The Engineers, mysterious giant humanoids furtively suggested in the alien spaceship wreck in &#34;Alien&#34; (the giant skeleton sitting in the chair), were a very promising thing for more than 30 years - and in this film all those promises were betrayed! Helmets? Really!? And the short scene revealing the origins of creatures from &#34;Alien&#34; made this Court frankly laugh (and it was a sad laughter...)<br /><br />Some mitigating circumstances are nevertheless recognized:<br /><br />- Michael Fassbender is the real star of this film as he steals the show as David the android.<br />- Noomi Rapace cannot (nobody can!) match Sigourney Weaver, but she still gives a honourable performance. It is highly appreciated by this Court that her character is a believing Christian, even if she seems to be the only one on board (captain Janek may be the second one, but there is not enough hard evidence to prove this). Much will be pardoned to the director for the scene in which she says &#34;This is the Year of Grace 2093&#34;.<br />- Another mitigating factor is the scene in which the alien ship develops a crush on Charlize Theron and she in return imprints on it...)))<br />- And finally, it must be recognized that the accused is still suffering from PTSD following his association with a film about Fat Robin Hood and Old Maid Marian...<br /><br />Therefore, taking all the evidence in account, this Court decides as follows: 1. The film itself receives one star (instead of zero). 2. The director is sentenced to a total of no less than 5 and no more than 15 years of bitch slapping by an alien queen of average size and temper, in a facility to be determined at a further hearing. 3. The sentence is suspended until the opening of the sequel of &#34;Blade Runner&#34; - it will be however executed in full if this film proves to be another disappointment.<br /><br />This Court is now adjourned and will drown its sorrows by ingesting Black Slime.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I love the Percy Jackson book/series. They are incredible. Its really neat to compare things I learned about with the things in the book. You can even learn a bit from it. Its actually really funny, with its sly, sarcastic remarks that can make anyone just crack up! When I started reading it, I became instantly immersed. I loved it and couldn't put it down. The description says nothing, the real truth is that Percy, a boy who lives in New York with his mother and disgusting stepfather. Things change majorly when he finds out his best friend is a satyr ( half human half goat), and is attacked by a thought to be mythological creature. He is whisked away to a camp for half-bloods, or people with one greek god for a parent, and one mortal one. Percy learns crazy things he can do with his powers, and is sent on a mission with a strange, beautiful girl named Annabeth, also a half-blood. They must return Zeus a lost possession to save the world from major godly war. In a tale of betrayal, friendship and nectar and ambrosia, it is sure to please all and be a book for the favorite books shelf.

If you are reading this review, you surely know what Minecraft is and what a worldwide phenomenon it has become, starting as an obscure Java game on the PC that quickly grew in popularity due to its engrossing retro visual style, building mode, fun multiplayer and the human race's infatuation with things-that-go-bump-in-the-night. Now Minecraft has come full-circle with this great LEGO set that couples everybody's favorite plastic bricks with Minecraft's voxel visuals, themselves likely LEGO inspired from the beginning.<br /><br />First thing you will notice upon getting this set is just how Tiny the box is. Yes, this is a Micro set, so be prepared for just what you are getting. It's only slightly bigger than a typical square box of Kleenex. Inside you'll find 480 LEGO pieces, mostly of the very small variety so the price-per-brick ratio may seem okay from a distance, but when you figure the overall volume of bricks it's one of the more expensive LEGO sets produced today.<br /><br />At MSRP $34.99 it is hard to recommend this set to anyone who doesn't already love either Minecraft itself, Micro sets or both. I feel this set should be priced more in the $29.99 range at the highest, especially when you consider that most fans will probably want multiple sets so they can build larger LEGO Minecraft worlds. The LEGO Minecraft Facebook page shows off some photos of what six sets together look like. I'll admit I really would love to buy 6, but not at $35 each. However, even if you only buy one set, it is a really cool shelf piece... and the two micro LEGO figures are really great, especially the creeper. This is a valuable set for collectors.<br /><br />So while I am so very happy that this set was approved and released, I can't get over how overpriced it actually is so I've decided to give this a 4 instead of a 5. Happy building!g!
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game! it's really fun and cool. I would totally recommend this game to anyone. everyone get this game! really just get it

B0082EFM2C|5.0|Haley Reinhart is a fantastic singer with a distinct raspy voice. If you heard one of her songs on the radio, you'd immediately know who was singing it because she has such great style and musical personality. I downloaded (legally *cough*) this CD somewhere else before purchasing it off of Amazon so I could hear all of the tracks in full. That said, there's not a bad track on this release and every song has its own flavor and is indistinguishable from the rest. This is a very well thought out CD and is not repetitive in the slightest. My favorite track is Wonderland. :)
B0068FZ024|5.0|Great movie really enjoy it everytime that I view the dvd, nice pace, nice story, nice time out with this wonderful adventure, great for everyone even if your not a horse lover.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of the most fun games on my kindle fire. I play temple run everyday, and my younger brother loves it too.

B007JRU4N0|1.0|The movie was great, not going to review it here. I am reviewing the streaming experience (first time on Amazon's site). I have it installed on my PS3, which is wirelessly on the internet, hooked with HDMI cable to my Pioneer plasma TV and also with audio cables to my Pioneer stereo receiver. I selected the option for \\"High Definition\\". I got the notice after purchasing the movie that it was assessing my internet speed. I pay for a fast speed from Comcast cable (Xfinity) as I work from home. The assessment finished, and it said it would be able to show the movie in HD. The message said that if it determined that internet speed became insufficient, it would switch to standard definition. Ok. So the movie starts after buffering for awhile, and it looks great, like High Def should. About 25 minutes into the movie, we get a message that bandwidth is insufficient and it wants to switch to standard definition. The issue is that I paid for HD (it's a dollar more). The standard view was almost unwatchable for awhile, then slightly improved to be watchable but noticeably degraded picture. I have watched HD streaming on my Apple TV and had none of these issues. I think I will stick to Apple TV for renting streaming HD movies.
1451626657|5.0|I get a kick out of the \\"1 Star\\" reviewers who thought it was too repetitive, or too long, or just didn't get it.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this novel is written in a unique style that takes some getting used to. I remember the first time I read it, I didn't get it at all for about 100 pages and actually stopped reading it. But then my sister said it was the best book she ever read, so I reread it with a new perspective.<br /><br />The \\"running gags\\" are my favorite parts, but just the way it is narrated is refreshing, even thought the book is 50 years old. If you have a small home library, this book should be a part of it.<br /><br />It's hard to rate my favorite books, because there are so many types of books that are so different. But I would definitely put this in my overall Top 10.
B0086700CM|5.0|i like the graphics and the whole game. sometimes it lags but it doesnt change my rating. l o l.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I purchased these books only a few weeks ago and I can't seem to put them down!  Great story line,  very intriguing !
B006VP1OYO|4.0|First things first: as of the writing of this review, there's no track listing in the product description above. So here it is:<br /><br />CD1<br />1.  you made me realise<br />2.  slow<br />3.  thorn<br />4.  cigarette in your bed<br />5.  drive it all over me<br />6.  feed me with your kiss<br />7.  i believe<br />8.  emptiness inside<br />9.  i need no trust<br />10. soon<br />11. glider<br />12. don't ask why<br />13. off your face<br /><br />CD2<br />1.  to here knows when<br />2.  swallow<br />3.  honey power<br />4.  moon song<br />5.  instrumental no. 2<br />6.  instrumental no. 1<br />7.  glider (full length version)<br />8.  sugar<br />9.  angel<br />10. good for you<br />11. how do you do it<br /><br />At the moment, this album, along with the other 2012 Kevin Shields remasters, is only available as a British import for some reason. So the big question for most people is going to be whether or not it's worth splashing out premium bucks for this thing, especially with the possibility of a cheaper domestic version coming out eventually.<br /><br />My answer is that it depends. If you're a big MBV fan or a collector, you probably will enjoy buying this set now. It not only pulls together all of MBV's EP's released on Creation (minus one track, see below), most of which are out of print or difficult/expensive to find new, it also includes a bunch of rare songs. I really dig being able to hear the evolution of the band's sound from derivative neo-psychedelia to something so massive yet ethereal yet still grounded in pop melody that it's almost indescribable. The sleeve design is cool as well. It's oversized and folds out into four panels, with each panel featuring the cover of an EP. The booklet is pretty minimal, though, containing only more EP artwork, a collage of band member photos, and a track list. There aren't any comments from the band, liner notes, or essays.<br /><br />On the other hand, those new to MBV should pick up [[ASIN:B000002LRJ Loveless]] first (while you're there, be sure to read the review by Heaven_17. It's still one of the best reviews I've ever read on Amazon, even 8 1/2 years after it was written).<br /><br />Bottom line: the lack of a better booklet--come on Kevin, after spending all these years remastering you could at least give us some insight into what you did!--knocks what could be a 5-star rating down to a 4-star. And keep in mind that this collection probably isn't the best starting point for new listeners.<br /><br />----------<br />Addendum: the Andrew Weatherall remix of &#34;Soon&#34;, which was released on a 12&#34; single with the full length version of &#34;Glider&#34; on the B-side, is not on this compilation (perhaps Shields views it as a corruption of his work). So, true completists have some work to do.ttom line: the lack of a better booklet--come on Kevin, after spending all these years remastering you could at least give us some insight into what you did!--knocks what could be a 5-star rating down to a 4-star.

030746363X|4.0|Let me start off by saying, I have not read the whole book - did not see a point to. Major changes to your life have to be made in order to live by the books standards .BUT, what I did like, was taking everything with stride, learning the lessons from the book, and taking what was applicable to my life.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This CD is so good from start to finish!  I love all of the songs and Adam's voice is just perfect.  He sounds especially beautiful on Never Close Our Eyes, Underneath and Outlaws of Love.  Trespassing, the opening song, is so catchy!  It should be the next single.<br />You will love this CD!
B005LAIHKY|5.0|I wen to see the Movie thinking ti was going to be bad, I was pleasantly sup prized by how good it was. I will buy it on Blu-Ray when It comes out. Johnny Depp was excellent as Barnabas Collins.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its a great game & quick to load. Easy to move cards & stack piles.  Classic game w/  basic optional features like Vegas style  or 3 card draw.
0439023513|3.0|The whole series is pretty well written especially the first book. This last book is rushed like others say and it seems that the author just had to \\"wrap\\" things up in a jiffy - literally. It seems that once you hit the last chapters - everything happens and then you're done - looking at the last page like \\"what?!\\"<br /><br />I am slightly frustrated that the author didn't take a bit more chapters to end this book smoothy. It just ended - like a stop sign to your face. A bit disjointed, but still a great series.
B0086700CM|5.0|At first I was like I don't think I will like this but then when my friend got it on her IPhone I was in love with it. I think everybody should get this amazing game.
0439023521|5.0|I was worried about reading this series since its been so hyped up, but I was not disappointed at all! This is a gripping story which keeps you on edge and makes you want to finish this book in one sitting. I was so bummed when I \\"had to\\" go to sleep so that I could go to work. I thought about this all day and practically raced down and broke down my door to get home to finish this book.<br /><br />Great characters, great plot, great writing, and interesting scenario of a future. Highly recommended!
B0086700CM|5.0|This should have been at the app store a while ago. I thought temple run was only for apple products but, I guess not. temple run I amazing and totally addictive! works great on kindle fire and I have played it for hours and it hasn't messed up yet like some comments say two words to finish: BUY IT
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I have somehow managed to make it to this last book, but I am now reaching a point where I just can not stand the sex anymore. CAN NOT STAND IT! I find myself skimming past pages of sex to get to the gist of the story. Seriously...this is a book on Viagra day 7 and needing to go to the ER room - because it has lost its edge. Too much! Too much!!!! I am tempted to just stop here at 30% on my Kindle. However I really want to know why this is a best seller? WHY? This book is setting up all sorts of \\"high expectations\\" for those out there who know nothing. I really don't understand. Too much sex in print...really is a bad thing.<br /><br />Dare I say that the Twlight series actually has some sort of crazy hot vampires vs hot werewolves plot than this crazy book full of \\"just sex\\"? What happened to having a good plot?
B007SGM084|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy is fun, easy reading! I am now reading them for the 3rd time and enjoying the story just as much as the first time!  I do see major references and similarities to the Twilight Saga but that makes it all the more interesting.  If you are looking for a romantic/erotic escape and some easy summer reading this is it!
0439023491|4.0|This second book in the Hunger Games Series is similar to the first book in where another \\"game\\" is held. I almost want to say another game in this book is almost too much, but honestly what would a second book be on anyways? At least this \\"game\\" in this second book is different and does keep you guessing and wondering what will happen.<br /><br />The author is good at keeping you guessing at every turn and still throwing out surprises that you don't seem coming. I would be interested in seeing how they would film this movie. The first book is the best I think...but hey that's my opinion.
0451156447|5.0|No wonder this is a classic - a beautiful little story about a lost soul.  One can't help but feel like reaching out to save Holly from herself.  Touching....
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How did this series sell so many books? I am now on the third book,and it just gets worse and worse. To be honest - the first book is not so bad. I was more open minded with the first book to see where this series will lead and now on the third book I am disappointed.<br /><br />However on to this first book. This is an interesting introduction into a different lifestyle if anything. Ana is a pretty bland character who just happened to be at a certain place and time who meets her fate. Christan is a young billionaire with oddly much time on his hands for his \\"lifestyle\\" choices. He has a semi-intriguing background.<br /><br />If you are tempted to read this series - please do so only when you are trapped with nothing else to do. I had a layover for 5 hours - so this was ok. I also do not find this book \\"erotic\\" if you keep reading about sex every other page or so. Imagine watching porn all day long - boring huh? This is like watching porn all day, unless watching porn all day long is your cup of tea - then enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was very captured by these books that E L James wrote.It was the kind of book you picked up and couldn't put down.It wasn't about all the so called mommy porn which I think is a bunch of bull. It had a much larger story to it. I guess some people picked it apart to get out of it what they needed. I myself though it was an excellent read and hope there are more to come.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I really think this series is waaaayyy to hyped up! I have managed to trudge through this book and all i can think about is - \\"Wow! How did this series become a bestseller.\\" I mean seriously...little plot, too much sex, characters with repetitive thoughts and actions - BORING! Why is it so long too? If you cut out the crap - this second book might be, \\"might be\\" 100 pages maybe. Its so long because of the over rated sex, dumb lip biting, \\"bend over, You are so beautiful, Oh boy\\" comments etc.etc..and you have 400+ pages. Amazing that this is being read across America.... \\"Oh boy!\\"<br /><br />Wish I could deduct percentages from 1 star. This could be 1/4 of a star... I have no wasted 50+minutes of my life on this book.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I just started this last week, and I can't put it down! Makes my brain work and it is addicting!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was such a controversy, and I found it to be incredibly interesting and not to mention, a little steamy and gave some ideas on how to spice it up a bit in the bedroom.  my hubby wasn't so upset about it!!! Loved it and I am reading onto the next two books!
B0086700CM|5.0|finnaly temple run has arrivrled for a kindle fire so excited I can not hide it just so happy :) :) lol!!!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad they finally added this game to the store! I have been waiting forever! I an obsessed with this game<br />:D
B0086700CM|5.0|finally its on kindle fire!!!!! Ive been waiting for so long! temple run is amazing no doubt about it!!! u should totally get it :)
B0086700CM|1.0|there were glitches and freezes. I hated it because on an ipad its so much better. if they are going to make temple run on the kindle fire with glitches may as well not do it at all. when temple run upgrades, let me know because it was that bad. do not buy this game, trust me I know how fun it is but not on a kindle fire. its just a waste of space for your games.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run will keep you entertained for a long time. Well worth the download. Get it while it is still free.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|At first the game seems simple but then...as you get further into the game it gets harder.  In fact you really need to keep your eye and hand co-ordination in check. I have only made it to the second level and the games are really getting to the point where I need to use some of my brain power also.  I thought games were supposed to be fun!  (Just kidding).  it is still very entertaining just takes some skill, but then I am in my 50s, and I grew up w/atari!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have waited sooo long for this game and have tried everything people said to do but could never get it. Im so glad this game is out and easy to get!! I play it nonstop and I am afraid I might wear it out! everyone needs this game. its better than any other game out there!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|great game! really loved it! no lag and also good graphics! I would highly recommend this game! its also free!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good game as long as you don't mind playing to unlock other games. the games are simplistic yet fun. it is a good game to just pass time with. especially since you don't have to spend real money to unlock the games.
B006074X82|4.0|**This review is for 2011 vinyl limited edition.**<br /><br />This is my most favorite DT record so far. It's flawless in sound, writing, production. It can't get better than this. The vinyl is perfect made. HOWEVER.....the cover image is pixelated. The text is fuzzy. I guess they just directly ported it from CD. It's a disappointment for this limited vinyl edition of this great album.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Its great-- the new Van Halen is great. Don't watch the videos. Definitely don't watch the videos. Listen to it LOUD.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever when I am on my free time I play it and when it is time for a brake then I play to I play before I go to bed and when ever I can.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|No synthesized help needed here...this group is the definition of raw talent. I pray that Brittany Howard gets the recognition she deserves. She should already be big time by now with that huge voice of hers, it's almost like she's singing as if no one is watching...from the depths of her soul.I love this group - all of them - and their look, and  I hope they never change their earthiness. Whoever doesn't truly \\"feel\\" Brittany when she sings may very well be already dead...God Bless Alabama Shakes!!!
B007MAETA8|5.0|Born and Raised is beautifully done. I have not followed John Mayer over the years but saw him recently on Dave Letterman where he was playing with Letterman's band.  He is so very talented. I love love the lead song - \\"Born and Raised\\", and that he has David Crosby and Graham Nash as vocals with him on this recording. They are in perfect harmony and the words and music are beautiful.....This CD has a little blues, a little country, and is a little folk.  John Mayer can sing, play and writes beautiful songs. Whether you are a fan of Mayer or not, you should run to buy this album.
B0086700CM|5.0|Its finally here and its free. Its really good that its free because they cant use it for a free app of the day and have superman75 ruin it!
B0086700CM|4.0|I love the game but if you've played it on a smaller device it is much easier there. I got it for my kindle fire and its not terrible but not absolutely the amezingest thing I've ever seen. My Recommendation.. Get
B007N8RULO|4.0|for a free game I give it four stars. not a lot of ads but nonetheless annoying...still if you are a spider fan u know how addicting this can be..give it a try...I like it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Have this on my kindle and my phone. Like comparing different versions. Wish it was split screen to be able to see 2 versions at the same time like I can do on my computer. Other than that love the app.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Really fun but I cant visit anyone else because it asks for an update but when I try to update it, it won't but it still says to update.  Without being able to visit others, I can't complete a task or two..... Other than that, I like it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Never have to call my husband again with a shopping list. on my phones, computer, and Kindle. even has my emergency info on it!  Love it!
B000HLDFK4|1.0|I acted in this movie and it's a dog. The story is weird but got made more weird because of an inept director. The project got way over budget and \\"lost it's way.\\" I saw that happen on-set as script got whacked in an attempt to stay on schedule. The crew had no connection with the director either. Note, you have never heard of the director have you? Good reason. As for the acting, even Keanu and Sandy, who are really nice people and hardworking, needed a director who directs people. This guy directed neither actors nor crew, and screwed around until the wee hours of the day. His first assistant director was also part of the problem; famous last name in the business but no organizational or people skills on-set. The show bombed at the box office for a reason, folks.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is so fun. I got it day before yesterday and am now addicted to it. I'll need to look for other imangi games.
B0086700CM|4.0|always want to beat your last score and complete objectives.......way better than the last game addiction (angry birds). so Its definitely worth getting and its FREE haha
0307730697|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much, I ordered copies for my son and my brother-in-law.  A great writer, a great story.

B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome game, I totally love it. probably the best app out there, I highly reccommend it for anyone who likes games.
B0086700CM|5.0|I been there before I keep practice but I am awesome I loovve it!?!&iexcl;!!!!!!!??!!!!!!!!! my name is temple run don't tell secret
B0086700CM|5.0|All I can say is that this is seriously the BEST. GAME. EVER.!!!!! Awesome, additcting, fun, everything you could ask for in a game!
0307949486|4.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo<br />Millennium Trilogy Book One<br />By Stieg Larsson<br /><br /> Mikael Blomkvist was a respected financial journalist but after being found liable by the courts is now a pariah in his field with no idea what he will do with his future he is suprised by an offer to ghost write a memoir of the Vanger family and find out what happened to Harriet Vanger in 1966. When he hits a wall with his research he enlists the help of Lisbeth Salander to research possible connections to Harriet's disappearance what they come across is far more sinister and intriguing than just the disappearance of one girl.<br /><br />Let me start with the fact that I have never read this book nor seen the movie, that being said though this is an interesting read it is very predictable. From the very beginning I knew what had happened but this also gave me the chance to say \\"Ha! I knew it!\\" The story is quite enthralling though and there are several aspects that leave you guessing which make up for the fact that the main plot is so easily figured out. The romance in this novel is subtle and beautiful, I didn't care much for Mikael's character he seemed like a womanizer but Salandar is a remarkable character with several depths and such a strong character you cannot help but like her. The only other problem I found with this book is that it is rather slow, the first half of the book is all build up with very little action or even events taking place but if you can make it through this it turns out to be interesting and is well worth the read.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is incredibly addicting and fun. True, it can be quite terribly infuriating at times, but hey, it's just a game - and brilliant one at that. Go play.
B00000IREA|5.0|I rented this movie because I had read that the group Duran Duran got their name from one of the characters in the movie. Barbarella was sexy and hott, and yet had a sweet innocence about her that was refreshing.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is seriously the best app I have on my kindle fire. it is sooooooooo addicting. not the bad addicting though.<br />AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I just needed a little journey in my life and Mr King accomadated me. This is what makes reading fun. Take a little trip back in time when we use to hide under our desks during air raid drills. A must read
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Drives me nuts sometimes,but i still love it. Wish i could change the size to make it easier to select boxes.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Often, a game will have a sequel that plays on the success of the original but sucks. Quell reflect however, picks up where the original left off. Good work falling leaf! kudos
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is simply insane! You start out *JUMP* running out of the temple, being chased by a *TURN LEFT* herd of monkeys. From then on, you are just running! It is easy enough *SLIDE* for my seven-year-old grandson to play, although he *MONKEYS* is disturbed that it never ends. I'm addicted!
B002BU0DPE|3.0|To start off my opinion on these varies over many different factors. To start off these are great for the price, even though I'm in high school and barely make money. They were easy to set up with my PS3 or my laptop, and everything was good... for a while. It's best to explain this in a pros and cons detail.<br /><br />Pros(Mostly based off of sound, for the price):<br />-Sound quality is pretty good, if you like FPS but aren't too much of an audiophile, these are great<br />-Bass sounds good on explosions and in game, also when i used it for music<br />-Game/Chat and the other switches on the mic's in line controller are useful<br />-Turtle Beach support is easy to contact and helpful<br /><br />Cons(Mostly cosmetic):<br />-The chat boost often raises the volume so that it is equal to game, this annoys me because I have it set low on purpose<br />-The switches move too easily, sometimes the cord hangs down to the floor and it messes up the sound<br />-The cord is a tad too long<br />-Comfortable for short periods of time, I played for 4 hours and my ears were red and sweaty, although this is understandable<br />-They are made cheaply, the wires have broken once, and the glue that allows the ear cups to swivel has dried. However, both times Turtle Beach Support had me covered and they were repaired and replaced.<br /><br />Overall i would get them because they are a good value for the price, and if they break Turtle Beach has got you covered.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had played this game on friend's phones and opossum and I just loved it. I'm happy that I finally got it in my kindle fire! I swear this game kills hours of time. great for long road trips!
030788743X|5.0|Not because this is the best book I read all year (\\"Just Kids\\" gets that), but because it was a strong contender and just so damn much fun to read. Engaging, and witty, 'Ready Player One' melds so much of what I love about sci-fi with just enough self-awareness to be endearing too. Does it feel a bit forced in places? Sure, all that fan-boy zeal has to. Did it detract from the story, or how much I liked reading it? Not a bit - it actually makes it more believable.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game! it is so addicting but thats the whole point of an awsemome game right? just know that this game is like the best app i have for my kindle &amp;&amp;; i would play it do forever if i could! :)
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Despite the talent of Meryl Streep and the many other performances which I have enjoyed by her, I was totally disapointed.  This movie does not live up to the rave reviews received by many.  I was also disappointed with the historical aspect of this film, where there appears to be great spans of Mrs. Thatcher's life omitted with way too much attention towards her decling years.  The Devil Wears Prada still remains my favorite Streep movie.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|it works for me. I only needed the basics so it does every thing I need it to do. I'm done
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is probably the most poorly written published book I have ever read! The characters are two dimensional, their dialogue is disjointed and cliche, and the plot is plain boring. I really can't understand what all the hype is all about. If you want smut, just pick up a penthouse or playboy. You are guaranteed a much better read!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good time waster. worth the download.<br />kindle fire. only glitches I found is also a benifit. no complaints to be found here.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I admit that I wasn't too excited when my book club picked this book as our next read. I'd heard just enough about the plot to make me nervous. Kids killing each other, really? I'm supposed to read this for entertainment?<br /><br />I gave it a chance, and found it to be a riveting and compelling read. Violence is integral to the plot, but it's not gruesome or drawn out. This is no celebration of violence, but rather a story about what it means to be human in the face of violence. I left with a deep emotional attachment to the characters, and a concern for their welfare living under a government that keeps its society in check by forcing children into a life-and-death struggle on live TV. Questions are raised about the dehumanizing effect on the audience of watching these gladiator-like games -- apt questions in our world of reality TV shows.Thanks for this one!
B006JTS5OO|5.0|So I decided to finally give Amazon.com a go this was my first purchase and was nervous I was getting this great deal and thinking maybe it might be worn out . Especially when I bought a used blue-ray but much to my surprise I got my order faster than told and it came in my mailbox very much brand new! I am now addicted to Amazon.com!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|It's easy to use. I bought it and I have no regrets. I switch between English and Spanish in the same text and swiftkey recognizes and works amazingly. I recommend it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|perfect for all my photo editing needs. I strongly reccomend this app. I have never experienced any problems with pop up ads. I LOVE IT
B0086700CM|5.0|it is awesome just waitng till come out on touch screen phones. I lhink they shoud make this game on everything.
B007OWG3LM|5.0|Without question - this contains some of their best work in years, maybe ever.  I recommend digital download however since the CD version does not come with any kind of documentation or lyrics.
0345803485|1.0|Poor writing, technically inaccurate in many aspects.  Flat characters.  A depraived masochist destoys the life of a beautiful, smart, loving young  woman with great potential.  He is a massive control freak & I don't know why her self-esteem is so low that she tolerates his control & abuse.  Will not read sequals.
0374203032|3.0|Professor Sandel has put together an interesting book that is brilliant in parts and lamentably incomplete in others.<br /><br />Starting with the good, Professor Sandel makes wonderful and compelling points about the things we lose when we apply market principles to everything.  In particular, I found his discussion of the loss of a sense of place and community when the naming rights for stadiums are sold to corporations.  I also found his argument (repeated regularly) that market incentives crowd out intrinsic rewards for achieving desirable endeavors to be very interesting.  I'm not sure I agree with it but it did make me think.  Finally, the major premise of his book is very compelling: our political and public discourse needs more moral consideration, not less.  Today, with the concern over vitriol in politics, I think this is an important point to develop.<br /><br />Unfortunately, those points were left undeveloped.  I expected an in-depth philosophical discussion about what it means to live well similar to Christopher Lasch's books.  Each time I read one of Professor Sandel's brilliant sentences I was hoping he would explore the idea in detail, unpacking the subtleties of his arguments.  I was always left wanting in that regard.  Often the philosophical discussions were washed away in the flood of examples.  While I appreciate empirical evidence and anecdotes, I find it strange that a book about the limits of economics followed the format of Freakonomics.  I also cannot help but wonder if the decision to tread lightly into serious political philosophy was guided by a desire to achieve widespread distribution and readership; in other words by the desire for commercial success.<br /><br />In the final analysis, this book made me think about the consumer mentality and how we have \\"marketized\\" more and more spheres of our lives.  It was thought provoking but I wanted more guidance (or at least a more academic argument) from a philosophy professor.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is a fun game that mixes thinking with action and easy to get.more credits. with out spending more of your money
B0081J9OWC|5.0|This band is all that is right in this world.  Buy this album.  It's summer.  It's friends.  It's all things good.  I love you Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros!  Keep on spreading joy!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very fun and entertaining game! Wish more games were this enjoyable when free!! Thanks for bringing it to the kindle fire!!!
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|Fantastic soundtrack with an upbeat theme throughout.  Great to listen to in the car or getting things done around the house or garage or working on a project.
B007JMW46U|5.0|The book is very interesting. It holds your interest. It would be easy to think it would not be a book for these times, but it is as good today as years ago.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I thought this book was very well written.  Well worth reading . Subject matter is for adults !<br />Hot and steamy read !
B005I6EVUG|2.0|I loved this case, it looks classy and the color is awesome but then 6 months after I got it the band on the bottom left unglued. I hadn't done anything extra with it and it may have just been my product but for $40 dollars you would think it would stay together for more than half a year. So I will be returning mine.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I decided to order this just because I wanted something that was big and that would take a while to build. I had no clue what I got into once I opened it. The bags are all labeled so you won't get anything confused, which is nice. Me and a friend built it in roughly 10 hours. This thing is very durable, except the green laser gun that pieces fall off of, but that really isn't bad. Everything on this is movable and comes with an awesome selection of mini figures. $400 is pretty pricey but this is totally worth it.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|You will not forget this movie. It is one of the best works of fiction s well as cinematography I have ever seen. It tackles social issues that are rarely touched because too taboo, such as the complexity of motherhood, including NOT liking a child -- an entirely possible and human feeling which is inadmissible and unspeakable in the current culture of idealized and sanctified supermothers--  and the true disconnect between spouses who cannot see their child in the same way. The titular Kevin, whom the parents fail to talk about, represents what Hannah Arendt would call the banality of evil. Evil just because. A force that cannot be explained, and is born to regular people who love each other every day.<br />This is a brutal movie, yet full of understanding about the human condition, in all its many nuances. The very understanding that psychiatry tries to capture and explain, yet always misses. You will not forget these characters -- Tilda Swinton is at the top of her game.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This is indeed a successful fantasy! Not only does it create an eerily-realistic world of a dying people and a desperate fight for freedom, but it also manages to portray an emotional depth. We live through the psychological challenges of the protagonist as she tries to get over the fact that she has killed many people. Not only that, but in this fantasy there is no black and white. At many moments you are not sure what is evil and what is good.<br />Indeed...these three books are thrilling yet real...full of killing yet brimming with emotions!
B0086700CM|1.0|THIS GAME SUCKS!IT S HOOOORRRRRIBLE.TRUST ME DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT GET IT.PLEEEEEEAAAAAAASE DO NOT GET IT.THIS GAME IS THE WORST
B005LBN7WQ|5.0|It's really sad that Westlife decided to split. They're a really good boyband (without any prejudice or stigma because of this term), with great vocals and stage presence. This GH album it's a good way to summarize all the 14 years of carrer, with a lot of good songs and ballads. And also, the new songs are great.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so excited when my sister showed me she downloaded it on her kindle fire. I went and downloaded it within the same minute lol.
B0086700CM|5.0|1.I wated so long for this app to come out now its finally here so happy!<br />2. I am addicted to it<br />p.s. why do people give it one star they must be pickey
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is not too hard to beat. I think its great for beginners yet entertaining for more experienced players.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|wish there was an easier way to get the cash... but I guess everyone needs to make money now days...

B0084IG8TM|5.0|I RARELY, if ever, hand out five stars to movies. But this movie was far deserving of it. A great adaptation of the superb series by Suzanne Collins. Obviously some things have to be left out, as all novels to film go, but they did a wonderful job regardless. I do however understand, that if you have not read/or you did not enjoy the books, that you probably will not enjoy the film as much as an avid fan like myself.<br /><br />Even critics (not that I take their opinion into consideration) who hate all the good movies, gave it a good review. It was refreshing to see an excellent and extremely unique movie for a change, with all the static of junk movies out there. I only have one negative thing to say, the cinematography was extremely jumpy(either due to style, an attempt to tame the violence, or both) The actors for Katniss, Peeta, and Gale were perfect.<br /><br />Prepare for; violence in a fight to survive, the effects of war on children and their families, valor and heart, a bit of romance, maybe a few tears, and struggles from the oppression of a totalitarian Government. I can't wait to see the other movies in the trilogy. This is a must see! You don't have to own it as I will, but I would watch it at least once to form your own opinion. Know this- It is a sensation for a reason. Even if it wasn't their favorite movie, I have yet to meet a single person that has regretted watching it. Maybe you too, will be left hungering for more!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|As our protagonist drifts from one dirty orgasm to another, I got to the point where watching eggs boil seemed to offer a hotter plotliine . Just who is the lucky person who gets to wash the rubber sheets? This is pretty steamy stuff,  but really three books???  Just read the first one over and over if you feel you need the mental stimulation to get going in bed. I am not sure I have the stamina to get through the other two. This is really guy porn for chics, lots of action, lots of description and not much of a story. This is not a book for women who require intelligent conversation prior to slipping off the bar stool. This is also not a good book to leave near your hyper-hormonal teenage daughter, lest she start spending her pocket money on red wall paint and spandex.
B007SSDS24|3.0|This will entertain you IF you are bored enough. It's worth a buck at redbox, maybe. Not worth the time. Just kind of a 'meh' movie. And the ending was kind of lame to say the least. It was a good idea in theory but turned out to be a bit cheesy at times with terrible dialogue to boot. I had high expectations and anticipated this movie coming out after seeing the preview, but I was let down tremendously. There are better movies out there. If I were you? I wouldn't spend an hour watching 'The Darkest Hour.'
B0086700CM|2.0|found it to be too simple and boring.  I lost interest in it really quickly and unistalled it already<br />not worth the download
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a really great game!  It is veryy addictive!  Download it now and enjoy it for hours and hours and hours
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|I am amazed at how polarized the feedback is about this recording.  As a long time Lou Reed fan, his career has been eratic yet visionary. He's the original NYC rapper ~ just listen to Walk on the Wild Side or White Light/White Heat if you disagree.  It took several times listening to it for my appreciation to grow ~ now I'm hooked!  In typical Lou Reed fashion, disturbing lyrics exist throughout the recording ~ this is private music for me when I'm alone; not to be shared with my wife (who might think I'm nuts & who would attempt to toss it). Major kudos to Metallica for recording this music with Lou Reed ~ I need to buy some of their music as well!  Yes, the CD is uneven, some of the lyrics are raw & gnaw at me & some filler exists at the end (the end of Junior Dad should have showcased Metallica at a frenzied pace instead).  I also think The View ranks up there as one of Lou Reed's best songs ever.  Remember, this is the same guy who created Metal Machine Music in the early 1970s ~ 4 sides of guitar feedback!  Anyway, I applaud both Lou Reed & Metallica for this morbid adventure pushing sanity to its limits!
B007SGM084|5.0|This was not only a hot sex novel but also a love story.  I thought it had a great ending as well! I definitely recommend it![[ASIN:B007SGM084 Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle: Fifty Shades of Grey; Fifty Shades Darker; Fifty Shades Freed]]

B007SYWFRM|3.0|fun to play but the extras are too expensive and it has bugs.  don't like having to explain to my son why he cant just buy the t rex
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|I downloaded the first free chapters (5) to my Kindle with great expectations. After the 5th chapter I wondered what I had missed. The story seems to just ramble on and on about the same few points. i.e. Mom and Dad were incompatible and never should have married or stayed together. Maybe setting the stage for the story - but 5 chapters of repetition?
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a really well polished. So far I have had no trouble whatsoever. Keep up the great work Imangi.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game, glad they finally came out with it on the Kindle Fire! But honestly, it freezes up a lot..which causes me to lose. That's the only problem I've really noticed with it, but then again I only downloaded it a few hours ago!(;<br />WARNING: This game is extremely addictive.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great 3d garphics and intence gameplay, you will get hooked after one run!!! different choices of characters and power ups
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS GAME IS THE BEST I HAD ON MY PHONE BUT NOW I HAVE IT ON MY KINDLE FIRE IM SOOOO HAPPY THEY ADDED IT TO STORE I'VE BEEN WAITING FOREVER!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|finally it's on kindle fire.  ive been waiting my whole life. now I don't need to play on my friends I phone.

B0086700CM|5.0|I luv this game its sooooo fun! plus its free so I don't hav to pay anything (yay) but man it took forever to get the game up on the app store gees lol but ohh well I still luv it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First, allow me to emphasize, that this 5-part omnibus is the only way to go if you are just starting out with this series. The individual works blend so seamlessly into each other, that this collection reads like a single volume. Besides, if you read part 1, you are just going to come back and grab the remaining four, guaranteed.<br /><br />No spoilers here, just the proclamation that this is easily one of the best works of science fiction that I have read in a long, long time. It's is not what I would term \\"hard sci-fi\\" (to which I'm an admittedly zealous fan), nor does it need to be.  \\"Wool\\" is, quite simply, a brilliantly realized tale, delivered by an author who has unquestionably hit full stride. In other words, jackpot.<br /><br />This is what we all hope to find when we're scanning for something that's shiny and new.<br />Hugh Howey has delivered an absolute masterpiece.
B0086700CM|4.0|Has glitchly moments on Kindle sometimes. But otherwise it is a really good game! Recommended for people with good reaction timing.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game so simple and yet its so addicting. it is also challenging if you like that sort of thing. I love this game. download it and see for yourself.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was waiting for this for so long! My friends all have this on their I Pods and I was getting jealous. TYANK YOU AMAZON!!!
B0076NKNLA|5.0|I found this movie to be very informative about Marilyn Monroe. I found out many, many facts about her that I had never known before. I loved the movie and plan on buying it at a later date. This is the type of movie I could watch over and over again. I felt like it could go on and on. I'm so glad this movie was made.
B0063IH60K|3.0|it is fun when it works. it freezes up my kindle and I have to delete it. then you loose all you credits.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|This book felt a bit lacking . Book one left me with many questions that I hoped Book two would have sufficiently addressed & yet I've reached the end of Book two still waiting on answers for the same questions I started the book with. I found that most of the book contained drawn out chapters that seemed like they were inserted just for filler material and that character development was sub-par. Overall it was a great storyline, a bit too detailed in some parts for my liking.
0345803485|1.0|The few chapters that I read reminded me of the Twilight Saga...Ana is Bella. Swan and Christian is Edward Cullen...Need I say more.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Definitely worth the money.  I got it as the faotd, but would gladly pay for it.  one of the best games out there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been a long time since I've been kept up late because I couldn't put a book down, but there was no way I could stop before I made it to the end of Wool.  This is a great book, a great story, great writing, not just great SF.  Mr. Howey struck the finest balance that eludes so many authors: he explains enough to keep you absolutely hooked and wanting to know more, but not so much that he tramples on the possibilities of imagination.  He paints a perfect picture.  He recognizes that some things need to stay mysterious, while others demand illumination.<br /><br />I've read some other self-published work and been sorely disappointed.  This is one of the best books I've read, irrespective of publisher.  Highly recommended!
B002962RKE|5.0|I really enjoy watching Glee!  It a good show that keeps me entertained!  The music is good and it has a decent story line... It is a must see for anyone who enjoys music.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game until my timers reset to over 120 hours.  I am very disappointed but obviously the game creator does not care about the players because this has been an issue for months!!!  Do not waste your time in playing this.  You will be let down when your timers reset, and trust me, they WILL reset :(

0307730697|5.0|As a young 24 year old man I absolutely loved this book. This is the ninth Navy Seal book ive read and this one is the best. It doesnt really go into the fire fight scenes like the others do. It doesn't have to. I think it sent a more powerful message. In detailing the life of Adam Brown, the author takes the reader on a journey unlike any other. Using vantage points from Mr. Browns family, friends and fellow operators the author is able to paint a more accurate picture of who Adam was as a person. From his wreckless days as a toddler to his post-high school years battling drug addiction. To the proudest moments of his life and then, sadly, the end of his life. I found this story to be inspiring by how perseverance, desire and accountability can lead to great things in life. What an amazing story.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Bill Murray is cameo is classic.  I can't hear When the Bells Toll without thinking of this movie now.  CARDIO!
B0064NTZJO|4.0|A ridiculously stylish, unusually-paced take on the crowded action genre. It's almost unheard-of for the lead in this type of film to be so stoic, contemplative and softly spoken, but in this instance it works magnificently thanks to a deep, powerful performance from Ryan Gosling and a masterful sense of directorial timing. Gosling's nameless wheelman speaks maybe one full page of very limited dialog throughout the picture, but the deliberate way he pauses to contemplate before acting (and the broad range of subtle facial ticks he broadcasts in the process) tells us more than an encyclopedia of dialog could ever manage. Without the rudder of a brash, charismatic lead, the plot often flirts with disarray amid a very loose structural backbone. Ultimately, though, it flows surprisingly well despite those departures, the lull of its often slow, casual pace emphasizing a penchant for sharp, sudden skids into violence. My only gripes lie with the shallow, under-explored villains at the heart of all the madness and a shortage of great chase scenes for Gosling to navigate. The few we get are so good, it's a real shame they aren't more frequent.
B002ZE43Z2|5.0|Good plot, like the grittier feel of this installment.  Christian Bale does a good job as John Connor.  Good effects, great sound.

B0034G4OUY|3.0|Just another car and killing movie.  Dwayne Johnson definately has better movies.  Wife loved it though.  It's very predictable. The bluray disc is good quality.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a real time killer and fun to play! Everyone who wants a great game should get this app.
B001794FOK|5.0|Awesome superpower just in the fact that you can avoid commercial flights.  Definately better on bluray than dvd.  One of those movies that you watch over and over.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I bought this book based on the reviews from other readers and I was not disappointed.  I finished in in a few hours because I just couldn't put it down.  I was so caught up in the relationship between Abby and Travis and the intricacies that I had to keep reading to find out how it ended.  The book is well written and realistic.  It's refreshing to read a book with a believable storyline and relationships that are realistic instead of contrived or \\"perfect\\".  I would definitely recommend this book to others and once I'm finished this review I'm planning to start reading another book from this authour.

0062012339|5.0|I am by no means a voracious reader (and in fact rarely read books more than 250 pages or so), but The Dirt was one of those books I found nearly impossible to put down. I probably plowed through its 448 pages in a few days.<br /><br />Motley Crue was my first favorite band (when I was seven) so I have a bit of a nostalgic connection with them. As an adult, I wanted to read their story and get the gritty details of their hard-partying, over the top '80s hair metal ways. I was not disappointed. While it may not be considered fine literature, the writing perfectly captures the voice of each member with often hilarious results. Some of my favorite moments were when a chapter by one member would mention the same moment another guy already described, but from a different perspective.<br /><br />There are plenty of other reviews that go into more detail on the content of the book, but there is one more interesting tidbit I have for The Dirt: every single member of the band seems to have learned some sort of valuable lesson by the end of the book--everyone, that is, except Vince Neil. Despite going through one of the most heartbreaking experiences detailed in the book (the death of his daughter), he seems to have shockingly learned nothing by the conclusion. The other members have been humbled in one way or another, but Neil simply seems to say, \\"you want me to change?

1573225517|5.0|I had seen the film and been a big fan of it for years when my brother suggested I join the world of the literate and read the book. Sometimes reading a book after you've seen its big screen adaptation can present problems--it could be hard, for example, to shake the image of John Cusack in a Chicago record store when the book takes place in the UK. But there were no such issues when reading High Fidelity. While there were definitely moments when the movie popped into my mind (mostly noting differences between the two), the novel was engrossing and extremely entertaining without distraction.<br /><br />So my review is directed at people like me who have seen and liked the movie: the book is (as the case often is) far better than an already great movie, and it's absolutely worth your time to take it in.
0345529057|3.0|I have yet to begin reading the books, so I cannot comment on the writing and story. I can, however, comment on the build quality of the books and packaging. I didn't expect a lot at such a cheap price, but the quality is fairly below average compared to other paperbacks I've read in the past. The printing is adequate and after a quick skimming through the books, I didn't find any glaring print or cutting errors. However, the binding is cheap and feels as though it won't last longer than a single read. Hopefully I'm wrong as I would like to lend these to my father after I'm done. The paper box the books are bundled in arrived torn in several places, it's not a huge deal, but disappointing that they would ship it in such condition.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|only complaint would be every time i try to locate players on fb it crashes... besides that I like it very much
1439192812|5.0|It is very well written and the illustrator is a genius! I loved the part where there was a stack of MILLIONS of photographs and each one was the previous photo's father...  As you can imagine, when you pull out a picture hundreds of millions deep in the stack you get a cool looking lizard or fish, etc.  It really helped visualize how evolution works.

It sure kept this over 65 year old Grandma entertained thoroughly!<br />Can't wait to read the other two books in the triloy!!
B006FECANK|5.0|I love buying shows or movies from Amazon. It is much cheaper than renting and so fast & easy. Not to mention that fact that the show I bought was a Once Upon A Time episode- totally the best new show out there right now!
B004V9MU86|5.0|Incredible !!! loved it !!!  This is not normally the genre of book that I would read however I was captivated.  So many other reviewers have praised the book so highly and in better words than I can use so I just have to agree with them.  Go and read this book now !!!
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Initially, I didn't want to read this book because i thought it would be depressing, but I wanted a memoir to listen to while I was exercising, so I got the audio book.  What a wonderful surprise! I loved the book; it seemed so sad, true and funny. I fell in love with Frank McCourt's voice; what a fabulous reader and storyteller!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun. I have it on both my phone and kindle fire. didn't think I was going to like it at first now I cant seem to put it down. I love it!!! if you want a challenging game this is it!
0345803485|1.0|Where do I start? Probably wishing I hadn't spent my money on a very non-descript novel. The main characters were unbelievable and invoked no feelings for them accept a very sarcastic 'Really?' Anastasia was pathetic, no-one is that naive or unworldly. The character obviously must have been locked under the stairs for 23 years. To be honest, Kate, her flatmate, would have made a better MC. But poor tortured Christian would have found her to much of a challenge, rather than the wet Anastasia (in the soppy sense).<br />Erotica takes a skilled hand that was not evident here. The writing was very childish and ill thought out and too repetitive. I could go on, but having read other reviews, I think I've made my point.

1442419814|5.0|Tally is an Ugly, an adolescent in a city where 16-year-olds undergo advanced cosmetic surgery to become Pretty. Tally can't way to become Pretty. Then the summer before her 16th birthday she meets Shay, another Ugly her age, and what happens next challenges her ideas not only about ugly and pretty but about everything she's ever known.<br /><br />Tally is not the most sympathetic protagonist. She spends much of the book arguing with or lying to her friends, and much of the rest trying to fix the problems that those arguments and lies caused. And yet I find myself empathizing with her. She's continually confronted with ideas challenging her entire worldview; it's hardly surprising that she unreceptive at first.<br /><br />The story has a frantic pace from the beginning, which seldom lets up for more than a few pages. If the characters aren't arguing about something, they're hoverboarding at breakneck speed or planning their next \\"trick\\" or worrying about getting caught.<br /><br />Uglies is a great start to great series; it presents a disturbing post-apocalyptic, dystopic world without being quite as dark or gritty as books in those genres tend to be.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|This movie was an amazing addition to the underworld franchise and IMO, its my favorite of the series. The action is over the top and its a blast to watch. If your a fan of the resident evil movies then this is right up your alley!

0439023513|3.0|Katniss takes to her new position as a rebel in District 13. She and a few others were saved from the Quarter Quell but Peeta wasn't saved and the Capitol has him. Katniss is still fears President Snow. After much thought, she decides to be the Mockingjay, for the rebel side. In return, she gets freedom for her friends and permission to kill Snow. Another Games victor, Beetee, makes Katniss a special weapon.<br /><br />Katniss has to film commercials for the rebel side, called propos. For one propo, she and a team that includes her old friend Gale are sent into District 2, where they see a hospital get destroyed. This inspires Katniss to call for justice. Because the rebels are gaining in strength, and because Peeta has sent out a coded message to the rebels warning them of an attack, the Capitol releases footage of Peeta being tortured.<br />Katniss is horrified by the way Peeta is being treated. The Capitol bombed District 13, just as Peeta said it would. Citizens of District 13 retreated underground for several days. When it was all clear, Katniss made another propo, while the rebel teams went to go rescue Peeta.<br />The rebels got Peeta and some other folks out of the Capitol, but Peeta's been badly hurt. He's been \\"hijacked\\" (as in, brainwashed) and now thinks of Katniss as the enemy. As soon as he sees her, he tries to kill her.<br /><br />Once she recovers from Peeta's attack, Katniss needs to be part of the action. She heads back to District 2 and is part of a summit about whether to attack the other side humanely or inhumanely. Gale suggests some inhumane kinds of weapons and strategies. During the battle that follows, Katniss gets shot. While recovering, she bonds with another victor, Johanna, and witnesses the wedding of victors Finnick and Annie.<br />After a second recovery, Katniss trains to be part of the fighting again. She, Gale, and Finnick are assigned to a special unit that will be filmed during combat and turned into more propos. Right before they go out into the field, Peeta's assigned to their unit too.<br />Katniss is afraid for her life. Though Peeta has improved a bit, he's still hijacked and hates Katniss. Her commander, Boggs, agrees that she should watch out. Boggs is one of the first casualties. Before he dies, he gives Katniss command of their unit.<br /><br />Katniss tells the others she has a secret mission to kill President Snow, and they follow her on what turns out to be a suicide mission. One by one, their team members are sacrificed as they make their way to the heart of the Capitol. Only five of them, including Katniss, Gale, and Peeta, are left by the time they reach it. Then they get separated.<br />During the battle, many innocent children die. Members of the rebels' medical team, including Prim, Katniss's sister, are also killed. Katniss is badly wounded again. On the positive side, the rebels have gained control and have captured President Snow. Katniss visits the imprisoned President Snow, who says she should blame President Coin  for the attack and Prim's death.<br />And maybe he's right. It appears the rebels staged the final attack, and the weapon Gale made  could have been the one that killed Katniss's sister. Katniss couldn't forgive him.<br /><br />In a meeting right before Snow's execution, President Coin says that the remaining Hunger Games victors must vote to determine whether or not the new rebel government should start up the Hunger Games again, as a way to punish the citizens of the Capitol for what they did to the citizens of the Districts. Katniss votes in favor. In part because of Katniss's vote, the answer is yes - the Hunger Games will start again.<br />Then it's time for Snow's execution. Katniss has the task of shooting him with her famous bow and arrow, but at the last minute, she kills Coin instead. Snow dies anyway.<br /><br />At this point, Katniss has a serious breakdown. Time passes, but she's pretty much in a fog. Later she learns that she was acquitted during her trial, and she's sent back to the ruined District 12, along with Haymitch and later Peeta. Gale disappears into another district.<br />Over time, Katniss is able to grieve for her sister and the many others who died. As she begins to rebuild her life, she and Peeta restore a romantic relationship and eventually have children.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|The 3D in Men In Black 3 3D was generally better than most 2D to 3D conversions, and is several notches above the very average 3D seen in Wrath of the Titans 3D, which also featured otherworldly creatures. If you're looking for better than average parallax 3D layers, good depth, some effective pop out moments, this one is a great purchase.<br /><br />3D Overall: 4/5<br />3D Depth: 4/5 Nice distance into the screen.<br />3D Parallax Layers: 4/5 Good separation of objects.<br />3D Pop Outs: 3/5. Not many.<br />3D Volume: 3/5. Objects generally look good and have some depth.<br />3D Consistency: 5/5. Most of this movie has consistent 3D strength.<br />3D Highlight Moment: J (Smith) jumping off the building towards the ground in 3D.<br /><br />Worth a 3D purchase? Absolutely. Recommended.<br /><br />Quick Movie Review: MIB 3 continues the adventures of Will Smith as J, and a younger version of K played by Josh Brolin, who does an exceptional job capturing Lee's performance. The plot is fairly basic, go back in time to prevent a disaster, and the main enemy is challenging enough. If you enjoy the series, this one is worth a buy. Not a whole lot of action, but fun overall, with some light hearted comical moments.
B004IQMXD4|2.0|I bought this for my mum as a gift for her birthday. And I'm sorry but me and her are in agreement with most here. I was listening and couldn't help but laugh a few times throughout some of the tracks. Some of the lyrics were so childish and simple that it was hard to believe they were written by nicks herself. Isn't she meant to be one of the best songwriters ever? Guess that proves she really does need a band around her to create the magic. This was a really poor effort.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This review is for those interested in the 3D for Avengers 3D.<br /><br />AVENGERS 3D:<br />The 3D in Avengers 3D is good overall, and generally has the best 3D moments in the final epic action sequence, where the 3D, usually on par with Captain America 3D, steps up the depth, parallax 3D layers, and Pop Out Moments closer to the strong 3D level. If you are a 3D fan, this one is worth a purchase for the 3D.<br /><br />3D Highlights:<br />All of the Avengers combined their powers to take down the enemy by the final act, with each 3D shot looking great in 3D featuring:<br />Iron Man jetting past buildings,<br />Thor slamming his 3D hammer into the back of a soaring beast,<br />Captain America tossing his shield into the screen towards the enemy foot soldiers,<br />The Hulk smashing rock into rubble as it flies out at the screen,<br />and plenty more 3D worthy moments including Loki, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johannsen in 3D kicking butt.<br /><br />Does the 3D enhance the movie? If you want an extra dimension, with characters like Thor or Iron Man, standing out apart from the background, as though you were almost seeing them in real life, then this is the closest you'll get for now. Would it have been better if it was filmed in 3D instead of post converted from a 2D source? If done right, yes, but what is here is done really well.<br /><br />3D overall: 4/5. (not an average) Better than average, but there is room to increase the 3D power in the sequel.<br />3D Parallax Layers: 4/5. Good. But Great by the lenghty end battle.<br />3D Depth: 4/5. You can see deep into the screen generally.<br />3D Volume: 3/5. Characters look generally lifelike with depth to their features.<br />3D pop out: 3/5. The pop out moments by the end are nice.<br />3D Consistency: 3/5. The end really stood out strongly, the rest was good.<br />3D Highlights: The end battle throughout, the outer space stairs.<br />3D strength similar to: Captain America 3D, Thor 3D, not as strong as Avatar 3D, which was mostly filmed in 3D, the others converted from 2D.<br /><br />3D Worth a Buy? Yes. Recommended in 3D. If you have a 3D TV, don't miss it.<br /><br />Quick Movie Review: With plenty of great action moments throughout, Avengers is one of the best action movies I've seen in years, thanks to one of the most epic, action packed, and incredible ending battle scenes gracefully combining all of the current Avengers working together to take down the overwhelming enemy, under Loki's command. The best thing about Avengers, despite a slow build up, is the well done balancing of showcasing each lead hero, offering them plenty of time in the spot light to feel like they each contributed a very important role to the movie. This is how to do it. Rating: 9/10 for the movie. Awesome.hich was mostly filmed in 3D, the others converted from 2D.<br /><br />3D Worth a Buy? Yes. Recommended in 3D.

B0086700CM|5.0|From the first time I played this game I found myself continuing to play it! it's.soooo fun and exciting at the same time:)*
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this game because of the 5 star rating. I started playing the game and immediately loved it. The concept is easy, the route IEEE basically a circle, but the excitement and fun lies in trying to avoid the obstacles. Jumping over stumps, sliding under flames and low hanging walls, and jumping over chasms, all while trying to collect coins adds to the fun. Because of the graphics, I think it works best on a tablet. I haven't tried the game on a phone.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|[[ASIN:B00198X0VS Men In Black II (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]]] was a disappointment.  It entertained, but it was a pale retread of the original [[ASIN:B007ATNHLI Men in Black (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]]].  Now, after a long gap, there's another sequel, which just seems unnecessary.  But Men in Black 3 is, surprisingly, a good movie.<br /><br />For those who haven't heard anything about the story yet, here's the basics.  An old enemy of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) escapes lunar prison and goes back in time to kill K before he's arrested.  Agent J (Will Smith) must then go back in time to save his partner and help his partner save the world the same way he did in the original timeline.  This gives Men in Black 3 a chance to play with the dynamics of the central relationship.  Even as a junior agent, K is reluctant to leave J in control of the mission.<br /><br />Part of its success is brilliant casting.  When you think of a younger Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin does not come to mind.  But his Agent K is uncanny.  He's got Jones's mannerisms down pat, but there's a levity and energy to his performance that reverses the passage of time.  Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man) plays Griffin, a fifth-dimensional being.  He's constantly babbling about which future he's in and the paths people might take.  This could be annoying, but Stuhlbarg (in his terrible woolen cap) sells it.  He's dorkily endearing.  Jermaine Clement, of Flight of the Conchords, is terrific as Boris the Animal.  (\\"It's just Boris.\\")  He's unrecognizable except for his deep voice, which is perfect for Boris's menacing proclamations.<br /><br />Emma Thompson and Alice Eve also join the cast as older and younger versions of Agent O.  Thompson does a fabulous job as always and Eve is fine in her few scenes.  But the film didn't quite earn K and O's semi-tragic never romantic relationship.  It's the problem of a series where each movie is produced without a plan for continuity.  K already had one wonderfully done failed relationship.  This one feels obligatory, like you can't have a summer blockbuster without a love interest.  O would have been fine as a fellow agent who just cared for K as a long-time colleague and friend.  (Or perhaps I'm just frustrated that at this point in the franchise all of the female good guys are love interests.)<br /><br />There are a couple of standout scenes.  There's a funeral for Zed, played in the first two films by Rip Torn.  Obviously Torn couldn't be in this film because of his legal troubles.  K's eulogy, paraphrased, \\"He never told me anything and after decades I know nothing about his personal life,\\" is perhaps the greatest compliment one man in black can give another and also hilariously brusque.  There's Agent J being hassled by cops in the past.  There's also Bill Hader's terrific cameo as Andy Warhol, unfortunately spoiled by the trailer.<br /><br />If you didn't like Men in Black, then I'd avoid Men in Black 3.  (Common sense, really.)  But if you did enjoy it, the new film might be a pleasant surprise.y had one wonderfully done failed relationship.

1439152799|5.0|I loved this book.  It is not a quick read and I sometimes don't like wordy novels because I am not patient -- I want to rush through to the end.  But this book is long and it IS wordy, but each word is to be savored as the mysteries build.  I was there  both in England and in the castle.  I could see and hear the people and understand their characters.  An excellent story.  I will look for other books by Kate Morton.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|The book started out good, I liked the character build up. But towards the middle and end it got a little far fetched for me. Who can go around beating up anyone and everyone who annoys you with out getting in trouble with the law? Please.... Also, Travis ended up being this puddle of needy guy. If he wasn't smashing someones face in he was on the ground begging for \\"pidge\\" to say she would be his. It kind of got old. He is an violent,alcoholic,with major self esteem issues. He didn't seem like the great catch after a while. It wasn't the worst I ever read but I could have more productive things to do with the two days it spent reading it.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|In this plot-by-numbers thriller, Mark Wahlberg plays an ex-smuggler who is trying to get his life back on track with a legit alarm installation business. His cozy suburban life is thrown for a loop when his brother-in-law, following in his tracks, is forced to dump a package of CONTRABAND by a surprise border inspection. Now the brother-in-law is in it bad (to the tune of 700Gs) with the roughnecks who were expecting the package. Led by a scraggly and amoral Giovanni Ribisi, these unscrupulous no-good-niks get Wahlberg involved when they threaten to punish him and his family for his bro-in-law's major muck-up. Gosh darn it, now Wahlberg is pulled back into the world he's tried so hard to escape from, forced to pull one last job to keep his wife and kids out of the paws of these vicious thugs.<br /><br />I can ignore how derivative the plot is. This is an old, old, old story (ex-con is forced back in the biz by thugs who threaten his new life and livelihood), and the addition of a giant boat, huge pallets of \\"funny money,\\" and a plot twist you can see coming from fifty minutes away do nothing to add a creative spin to the tale. It's so formulaic, in fact, that I promptly forgot every character's name when the movie was over.<br /><br />Wahlberg is one of the few bankable stars left that hasn't completely alienated his fan base. His pretensions aren't very high, which helps, and he is smart enough to stick with what he's good at: being tough, sharp with a word, and cutting an imposing figure. It's fun to watch him, and even though his character here is as flat as a slice of processed cheese, he doesn't seem to be boring himself, and so the audience has a chance to avoid the same fate. Ribisi, too, gleefully chews the scenery as the movie's token Bad Guy Without Limits, and although his character behaves in ways that would normally get him arrested in seconds, his overall implausibility is dismissed by the sheer volume with which he plays the bad guy.<br /><br />There's action here, too, although it's equally implausible. Smuggling, it seems, is all about timing and foresight, and although Wahlberg's bunch gets thrown more than a few curve balls, they all seem to have the keenest sense of timing. Count how many times someone avoids detection or discovery by a literal hair's-breadth, and you'll probably hit double digits before the film's half-way mark. This long train of consistently close calls ends up having the opposite effect, deflating whatever tension the story might have built up. \\"Let me guess,\\" I said to my friend. \\"In this scene, one of the smugglers accomplishes his task with half of a second to spare.\\"<br /><br />If you're older than thirteen, you've probably seen this movie before. You can guess who will win, how they will, and even what \\"surprises\\" the movie might have up its sleeve. It's like Mad Libs for movies, these kinds of plots. In this case, it's all done with workable skill and there's nothing glaringly awful about the film. It's just not very impressive or unique, either. It's shrug-worthy, in other words.'s action here, too, although it's equally implausible.

In this case, it's all done with workable skill and there's nothing glaringly awful about the film. It's just not very impressive or unique, either. It's shrug-worthy, in other words.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I ben wanting this game for the longest on my kindle fire and it is good
B007SY3CEW|5.0|this is great!i love the different song it you want to practice this is not your game if u want to full around this this is your app
0345803485|1.0|After reading most of the reviews from everyone I am SO thankful that I am not the only one who thinks this book is absolutely terrible! I borrowed these books from a friend who swore they were the best books she has ever read. Even her mom and all her friends read them and loved them! She literally could not stop reading them and finished all three in a week. I am currently reading the second one and I don't have the heart to tell her how much I hate them or stop reading them and give them back to her. Where to begin with how bad it is..I'll try to sum it up. There is no story line, it is so painfully boring, no plot, the author repeats the same words/phrases over and over again. If I have to read about Anastasia's \\"inner goddess\\" or \\"sub-conscious\\" one more time I might kill myself. Oh, and they use each others last names when they talk to each other? And they talk like they are from a different century. The characters are so unlikeable and unrealistic. The author sounds like a 14 year old who fantasized this story in study hall one day or she sounds like a 55 year old cat lady who hasn't had sex in 25 years. Hmmmm what else.. there are about 30 pages devoted completely to e-mails between the main characters and it so so annoying to read. I think the worst part is the author's use of the same phrases and ridiculous use of the word \\"fifty\\" when describing Christian Gray. Apparently all the guys in the story love and want Anastasia, which is very hard to believe because she is so BORING and annoying. The first book was so bad, the story literally goes no where! There was no climax to the story at all, and the SEX scenes are not hot. They are actually kind of creepy and weird.<br /><br />And trust me, the second book is WORSE. There is no story line, nothing happens, and oh, the author threw in some weird crap about a crazy ex-submissive who apparently has a pistol permit and might be coming to get Christian for revenge? I hope she gets them and kills them both. Theproblem is this \\"drama\\" with the ex came out of no where and I actually laughed when I read that part. I am trying so hard to get through the second book but I don't know if I can finish it..I have no idea how this book got published and I cannot believe the media hype over it. Which ever Hollywood actors partake in this movie will ruin their career.<br /><br />Oh, and I LOVED the twilight books. Please don't confuse yourself, this crap is nothing like twilight. Besides the author's weak attempt to try and make the characters sound like Edward and Bella, and centering the story in Washington state, that is about how far as it goes. Do NOT read this book. You are better off burning the pages to start a fire.<br /><br />I am not an author but I feel that the review I just wrote is a better piece of literature than this horrible, horrible book! If anyone actually likes this book I beg you to get out and read more or have your head checked!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|As soon as I bought this book, I started to read. I just could not put it down. I have never been so entranced in a book before (not even when reading Fifty Shades). This book is everything I have been told it was plus more. The ending was the best ending. I have never read a book where at the end it stated a powerful statement and left me screaming \\"WHAT?\\" (trust me I did scream). Brilliant book.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's amazing how much motivation the zombie monkeys provide! I love this game. So far it works better on my iPhone than my Kindle. It seems to lag a bit on the Kindle, which gets you dead quick.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was intrigued by all the hype that I had heard on the talk shows about this book.  Half way through reading the first of the triology, I bought the 2nd and the 3rd books.  I can honestly say I have not lamented the end of a series so much prior to reading this one!  Great read, constant page turner.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game much fun and always keeps me busy on the go! i deffinatley would recommend this game to ithers
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it it is one of my favorite apps it will help complete my colection it is awesome love it and so will you

B005HJWWW8|5.0|Having not ever looked into headphone amps I was quite surprised that I had somehow missed this massive improvement to my listening experience! My friend had given me the little push towards looking into a headphone purchase and said while I was at it I should also look into getting an amp. He suggested the Sennheiser HD 439 [[ASIN:B005SNPV94 Sennheiser HD 439 Headphones Black]] as a fairly priced nice pair of headphones and then said the E6 would take those amazing headphones from amazing to brilliant. Being somewhat skeptical I went with it anyways and I have not looked back since!<br /><br />Quality:<br />-the switches are a bit loose for the EQ changing and locking but works so I can't complain.<br />-Comes with two clips which makes me wary of the quality of those as well...<br />-Fairly solid cables for charging and connectors (comes with the USB charging cable and two AUX cables)<br />-The LED lights are pretty cool as well but do not draw your attention when you're doing other activities.<br />-The main \\"box\\" is solid and it has a nice weight to it which was surprising since it's so small.<br /><br />Battery:<br />-I have not gotten to experience the full battery life but so far it hasn't been too bad... I really haven't had it far enough away from my computer to use the battery much which is nice.<br /><br />Other than that I don't really have any technical review material since I'm pretty new to this whole headphone amp thing.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game Soooooooooooooo much and I'm soo happy that I can play it on my kindle fire! :)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The beginning and middle are pretty racy. Towards the end you will not be able to put it down. The next two in the trilogy are even better!
B0086700CM|5.0|I like the graphics in the game. As your score gets high the harder it gets. I just bought some things in the store
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I am not a sappy reader but my sister suggested this book to I thought what the heck and I am glad i took the time to read it.  The begining was great but he end was a little rushed but over all a great read!
B0086700CM|5.0|This. Game. Is. Amazing!!! It is so addicting and I could play it all day trying to beat my previous score. There is a little delay sometimes, but I'm still rating this 5 stars because, like I said before, it's so addicting!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|it makes you think what move to do like turn - jump and a lot of different things and I would tell my friends about it
B0086700CM|5.0|omg!!!!!! this app us awesome! we love it!ive been waiting for this for a long time and we finally get the actual TEMPLE RUN!!!!! you get chased by zombies and you have to jump slide duck and turn in temple run this is sooo addicting!!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was incredible; incredible enough that I had to jump on my computer and write a review for it, which I have never done for a book before. The romance was so real, and every word that left the pages had me gripping the edges of my seat. I purchased the Kindle edition but will be buying the paperback version as well so I can read the story when my computer is not with me. No exaggeration, I loved this story THAT much. Perhaps it can be attributed to the fact that I'm in my 20's, or perhaps because I saw a lot of my relationship in Abby and Travis'; but regardless, I loved it. And I'm sure you will too.
B00870ZH3U|2.0|This is so awful it is family guy maury mash-up bad.  It starts with this whiny kid they have when did they sleep together ?  Wait isn't the year eighteen hundred women running around with guns and fornicating back then. I'm a huge \\"Phan\\" but my gosh this was a disgrace between all the little people dancing and the vocals were nearly dreadful what happened to the ballerinas?  It was supposed to be romantic and forbidden love but it turned it into a Jerry springer episode. The only thing that made this movie worth it was the song \\"beautiful\\" and the cinematography was pretty. This was like a bad comedy almost like a spoof.  The bathing beauty  skit really ? turn it off somewhere around there. I bet Gaston leroux is flipping in his grave you know that guy who actually wrote the real  book version ? Save your money and re-watch the first one.
B0086700CM|5.0|it takes for ever to load I love the game but takes forever but love it temple run rocks awsome
B007SYWFRM|5.0|lots of fun for young kids. cute clips and movies. nice graphics. easy to use and understand. have had lots of fun playing as a team.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app works very well. So far it has always worked, and it's easy to set music as the alarm.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game i cant get my mind off of this i play it every single day i even take to school and play this game
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome.I could play it all day.Its so easy to learn.Its very addicting because I can play all day.You better get it and its free!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Alrhough the beginning was a little slow moving for me, about 1/3 of the way through the reading I was hooked!  Great ending and a fun read!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I struggled with making my way through this book.  I had heard so many mixed reviews....some people LOVED the book, others hated it.  I side with the haters.  The love story in the book was so unbelievable and juvenile.  The writing, OMG the writing......It was AWFUL!  The same descriptions were always used and the language was just plain terrible that she used to describe things.  I also did not think it was racey....I just hated it.  I am not even moving forward with the other books....no desire at all.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I really enjoy this game and the people I have met playing it. the grafics are cute and a lot of people have made really cute restaurants they are fun to look at!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game will definitely keep your interest. It has so many puzzles and keeps you working at different pictures for hours.  As soon as you finish you are compelled to solve the next one.  Some of them really surprise you when you see the finished picture.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think that this is the best game out there to play. It is easily the most played game on my Fire. I play it all the time even thought I'm not very good at it but still very fun.
B0086700CM|5.0|All I can say is Perfect<br />Only problem is repetitive.<br />But u can buy power  ups and characters. The monkeys look very funny.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is my most favorite game ever. it is so addicting. it is easy first then it gets very hard. just get a good strategy.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This book is so good on so many levels.  It starts out a little slow and then sucks you in.  I did not expect to like this book at all.  Hey it was free! So when my full attention was caught I was amazed with myself and the book. There was no way that I could put it down until I was at the end; about 12 hours later.  I was a child of this era so it was startling to hear about it as a adult rather than a child.  What a big difference.  I have already given excellent feedback to all my friends and whoever I saw that had it in there hands at the book store.  The ending was a refreshing change from what I imagined.  After a little thought I knew that the author had made the right decision to end it like she did.  I read this book again about a week later just to make sure I had not missed anything that happened in the story.  Just as good if not better the second time around.  This book will stay in my library with all the other re-readable books I own.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Excellent - fun - challenging at some levels gets more challenging - somewhat addictive - works fins on kindle fire - AGOOD GAME AND BUY.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|free no way its to good to be free get I recommend this app for everyone<br />u need it zombies and samurai no way.......get it get it
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is fun and I will admit I'm a bit addicted to it. I have an HTC EVO and haven't experienced any issues as of yet.
B0086700CM|5.0|great for killing time and satisfying that gaming addiction.  they could definitely come up with more levels and characters to change the scenery.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|Very entertaining.  Though the ending lost a few points from me, overal it was refreshingly imaginative.  I enjoyed watching this.  Don't get that too often these days.
B004ZNA5JO|4.0|Could not tell the difference between this remastered edition of the CD and the original version. It seems like they are just trying to get us to buy the CD twice.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game rocks! I love it. you get to fight zombies and protect your village, and after you beat s certain amount of levels you get new allies and new moves like legarthy (it makes the zombies slow down) and diverse (you can summon allies but sometimesbyou sword turns into a chicken if this move is used incorrectly. you also can level up you hero and his sword and stuff.Ps. in this game you use fake money to buy stuff.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am very happy with this blu-ray set, purchased as a gift to my lady who is a big starwars fan, who was very happy too, we both don't mind the minor adjustments, the value of this complete set in HD to us exceeds the need for complaining and protesting for the \\"originals\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game! I love it! :} &asymp;) i hope you all enjoy it as much as i have and will for a ver long time
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's. not a bad game. it'll keep you entertained for awhile.  its free so its definitely worth the price. some of the controls need work though
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is super awesome!!!! if this cost money I would most definately buy it!  never really lags at all.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I lice to read. But, at the same time I am limited on my reading time. Buying this trilogy was an amazing find because I didn't have to wait for a \\"boxed\\"set to come out. This e-bundle made it easy for me to get and read the complete set without having to go to a store and wait in line to purchase these items. Thanks Amazon.com.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!!!! They finally got in on the Kindle fire!!! There is nothing bad about this game. Everyone should have this game Cuz it totally rocks!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Omg this game was recommended. to me and I royalty love it it is soooooooo worth it and its free its so cool and I love it so total reccomend it to people
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for a REALLY long time for this app to come out!!!!! And its finally here! My friend jusy got a new phone with temple run on it &amp; would never let me use it so now I finally have this app!!!! I &hearts;LUV&hearts; this app! All of the peeps who didnt give this 5 stars are retarded! This is like the best app like EVER!!!!!!
B004SC7B6M|5.0|I bought this album on a whim as part of a promo for more Amazon Cloud space having only seen the video for Angels on Youtube and was very pleasantly surprised.  I had been looking for a sound like this for a long time and finally found it.  I've since purchased all of their albums and have become a big fan of symphonic metal because of them.
1442344288|5.0|This was a great book.  It was so much better than I expected because I don't usually read Steven King books but I liked how this was very much a mystery type of story.
0345803485|4.0|Love the book. The story I mean. Not the writing. Hate the writing. However I was really upset about the ending. I feel the second book should have been a choice. However the author left it so I had no choice but to buy book #2 just to know what happens. I bought the trilogy because I fell in love with the characters. And I think it takes a decent writer to do that. Make you feel involved in their life. however....<br /><br />  The writing was really, really bad at times. The word \\" Murmur\\" for instance is beyond abused. This along with a handful of other words and phrases. For such a short book i would have thought the writer could have been more creative. And less descriptive. Taking a whole page to describe a room. Using words the lamen would not know. Someone clearly wanted to appear smart but it failed.<br /><br />I did enjoy the story so boring sex scenes and terrible writing aside, I was captivated and wanted them to fall in love. So 4 stars.
0375805621|3.0|I agree with the other reviewers that felt this book was a bit of a let down.  It isn't a horrible addition to your library, but don't have your expectations up.
0345803493|4.0|I am not literary pro. But I do know when the English dictionary and thresourus is being abused. If I read the word MURMUR one more time!!! I would imagine it was used more then 100 times. There must be another word to described speaking softly. The writing is terrible at times. Using as complex a word as possible to describe the simplest things.<br /><br />  I really do love the story and I am almost done the last book. However I truly feel this could and would have been better suited as 1-2 books not 3.
158270208X|4.0|I have known about \\"gratitude\\" for a long time.  I do my best to talk gratitude or write down my gratitudes.  Sometimes I fall off the wagon about writing it down.  I appreciate having this journal.  Yes, I could just go out and buy a small composition notebook or some other journal which I have done.  I have written in them etc.  Having this particular gratitude journal and being able to read the uplifting sayings is helpful to me.  It sort of quiets my mind to the task at hand.  I know gratitude works and it's not always easy to be grateful with everything we are all dealing with.<br /><br />If you are willing to spend a little money for a nice journal, I would recommend this one.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I don't own this...and I never will. However, if the day comes that the original theatrical releases are included I would buy that set in an instant.
0345803485|4.0|This is the perfect starter book for anyone who has never read erotic fiction. It's not good, but it's easy to read, it doesn't have Fabio getting felt up on the cover, and when it gets steamy you can take comfort in knowing that there are millions of other people reading and enjoying the same book.<br /><br />Erotic fiction has a kind of reputation as \\"girl porn,\\" and in a way I guess it is, but this is a fun read, and if you've never read erotica before it's refreshing to read a book that isn't about some random action hero who becomes President and gets to fist fight bad guys. There are a lot of upset erotica readers panning this book because it's not up to their standards, but I know a lot of erotica writers who are so happy that this book came out, as they're hoping it will help people who have always been afraid of the genre get hooked and get a taste for some real erotic literature.<br /><br />Not a five star book by any means, but accessible and a fun read.
B001I8A76A|1.0|Can not download to iTunes.Therefore,I never listen to the music. I am very disappointed,maybe next year Amazon will join 21 Century?
B007JM4CWY|3.0|I've loved this kind of puzzle since GAMES magazine started publishing them - but couldn't complete one in the magazine because errors were too tough to recover from. The handheld version seems like an ideal answer.<br /><br />Downgrading it to 3 starts because it's far, far too easy to accidentally change a cell's contents when you're scrolling. Needs some kind of way of limiting cell changes to only when you WANT to.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game sooo glad it is on kindle I could play it for hours on end it is so much fun!
B007C3TVNA|5.0|I took this movie to be about the budding and full night-blooming of a psychopath, and how the presence of such an individual affects a family. From infancy on, Kevin has an instinct for inflicting an endless series of sadisms, aimed particularly at his mother. This movie shows the ominous growth of his malignancy.<br /><br />But this movie is more subtle and realistic than other shockers about \\"The Good Son\\" who is really oh-so-bad. This film portrays an animus that I felt really could exist in the heart of a warped individual. This becomes a fascinating study in how family dynamics get defined by the most perverse member of that family.<br /><br />After the shocking inflictions of Kevin though, this DVD gave me another, perhaps even more unsettling shock when I listened to the interview bonus features on it. The majority of people involved with the making of this movie put the blame for Kevin's maladjustment directly on his mother, played with such stark effect by Tilda Swinton! Producer, director, and Swinton herself, generally seemed to be saying that Kevin's predations were caused by his mother's initial reluctance about her pregnancy, and then her subsequent \\"lack of authenticity\\" as a parent. What?!<br /><br />This attitude among presumably modern people is a throwback to the days when mothers (usually mothers) were blamed for children's autism, schizophrenia, or Tourette 's syndrome. The mothers were accused of being overbearing, or alternately, too indulgent. I felt strongly that it was no failure in parenting that planted the bad seed in the heart of Kevin. In this sense, the producer/director's harsh judgment on the mother reflect the same  ill-informed, almost lynch-mob-like blame that the film shows the townspeople casting on Swinton's character as a result of her son's ultimate actions. All this adds to the weight the mother in this film, and beleaguered mothers everywhere, still must bear.<br /><br />It's true that Swinton is shown looking bleak and at a loss directly after Kevin's birth. In the early silences of the film, we see the mother harkening back to her glamorous days apparently as an acclaimed writer and a globe-trotter - reveling in places such as the annual tomato-throwing festival in Bunol, Spain. (The film's symbolism and premonition is a little obvious here, opening as it does on Swinton being splattered by, drowning in, the blood-red tomato puree of the festival.)<br /><br />But really, a mother's being ambivalent about a pregnancy and having some, perhaps transient, sense of a descending bleakness, hardly gives rise to a psychopath!<br /><br />In addition to being about something other than what its producers think it's about, this film seemed to me to perhaps make a few cinematic missteps. After that over-the-top obviousness of the tomato festival, Swinton is shown in a series of overly arty shots, sterilized, pinioned against exaggerated backdrops, such as a Warhol-like grocery shelf full of red soup cans. The psychology of Kevin's malevolence also seems off. PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT! Kevin's bedwetting, general incontinence, cruelty to animals, and calculated sadisms are generally more predictive of someone becoming a serial killer rather than committing the kind of horror Kevin ends up committing. END OF SPOILER.<br /><br />For me though, the film overall succeeds brilliantly at portraying the development of a child who, for some unfathomable reason, embodies the heart of darkness - and the clenched suffering his family must bear as a result.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great i have been waiting for it to come to the android market for a while it is very fun and addicting
0345803485|1.0|I am no snob when it comes to reading material.  In my teens I devoured Jackie Collins and Judith Krantz and even plowed gamely through Danielle Steel.  I've read my share of bodice-ripper romance novels.  I'll admit to a secret enjoyment of Laurell K. Hamilton's Meredith Gentry novels, also known as \\"elf porn.\\"  Hell, I'll even read fan fiction if it holds my interest.  So when I heard about the phenomenon of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" supposedly birthed as a \\"Twilight\\" fan fiction piece but with super-graphic sex, I figured I'd check it out.<br /><br />I will say that it's a page-turner--but not for the reasons EL James hopes for.  It's because I was absolutely horrified that something this badly written not only got published, but got popular.  If I hadn't known James was forty-something I'd swear on whatever you hold holy that this thing was written by a 16-year-old girl who's never been kissed.  The \\"hero\\", Christian Grey, is impossibly rich, impossibly handsome, impossibly well-endowed and, of course, falling in love with beautiful innocent virgin Anastasia Steele, who despite her virginity seems to get right into the whole whips and chains thing while uncovering Christian's \\"damaged\\" side and therefore immediately falling in love with him because she thinks she can save him.  The vaunted BDSM stuff is, in my opinion, fairly tame--the Sleeping Beauty series by Anne Rice was much worse, but then again it was much better written too.  The dialogue is ludicrous, as are the constant references to Anastasia's subconscious and inner goddess, who between them do so many gymnastics they should try out for the Olympics.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is a very typical romance novel disguised as BDSM porn and since the average romance reader is unfamiliar with that it makes the book OMG SO TITILLATING AND ROMANTIC.  In the hands of someone who could actually write, it might have been a better book, but EL James shows herself for what she is--a crummy fan fiction writer.  And we all know there's WAY too many of them.
B000002GJS|5.0|Waking Up The Neighbours is one of my favourite....all the songs are great....its not all the time u will buy an album and like every last song on it.....but i must say out of all the albums i owned.....this bryan adams is the best!!!!!!!
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Brilliant! This season contains all of my favorite Doctor Who-ft. Matt Smith episodes, including The Girl Who Waited and of course The Wedding of River Song. But if you're new to the WHOniverse, better go back to Season 5 and start there (which is where I started; now that I'm caught up, I'm going back to Season 1-ft. Christopher Eccleston). Geronimo!
B0086700CM|4.0|it gliches up with me sometimes other wise I love it. but  I dont think its exactly five star its about four star.
B0086700CM|5.0|been waiting forever for kindle fire to get this app ever since I played it on my friends iphone!!! LOVE ITTTTTTT
1400069289|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in long time. The author explores the subject of habit in a manner that informs, intrigues and inspires the reader. If you are fascinated by the wonders of the mind you will live this book.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Okay, I'm hooked! I haven't enjoyed a game this much since Zuma . Awesome app. Works great on my kindle and my razr maxx. No bugs on either. Great graphics, colors  and game play. Definately can't turn my kids onto it or I'll never get to play again! Thanx for my new addiction!
B00785P2QC|2.0|YOU HAVE TO ADD MONEY IF YOU EVEN WANT TO MOVE ON IN THE GAME PLAY. OTHERWISE IT WAS FUN THEN GOT BORING BECAUSE YOU REALLY STALL OU IN PROGRESS WITHOUT PAYING FOR CREDS.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I don't know where to start here. I didn't think that Collins would be able to expand further on this world but she did it here. I couldn't believe how things turned out. I do wish they gave just a little more description at the end and when you read it you will understand. The whole series was thoroughly entertaining and I highly recommend it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it reminds me of super Mario bros back in the day......can't put it down.....works great on my kindle fire...going to recommend. this game to my kindle buddies.
0345529057|5.0|delighted with both the books and the service i got from amazon books arrived within a week 5 stars. the books are much better than the tv series i would recommend them to anyone that likes the tv series
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome game I really. really really really love this game. but i wish that you could get more power ups sooner and less coins to pay for them ......

B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is good game to play its a hard game  but really good to play me and my mom play this and we just have with it!
B004SDEP38|4.0|I also kept having the issue DanB had where it would tell me to update in each.  I finally kept the more recent one in Play Store and ignored the update requests in Amazon.  Then, I had the idea to delete it in the Amazon appstore, since in every case I have seen, Amazon is never ahead of Play and usually lags behind.  That seemed to work.<br /><br />Just delete the Main app (NOT the Full Version Key) in appstore using browser (https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/your-account/myapps.  On the right of the entry for the app, click Actions->Delete this app. Then, on the phone, Menu->Settings->Applications->Manage, and for the Amazon app \\"Appstore\\", do a Clear Data.  You will have to re-enter your Amazon ID the next time you run the app, but it forces it to reread your apps list and fixes the update issue.<br /><br />As long as Documents to go is still installed and shows up in Play Store, everything will be fine.  Otherwise, reinstall Main app using Play Store, not Amazon, and the constant updates should stop.  The app is now in Play Store only, while full version key is still in Amazon.  Hope this helps.
B005LAIGLE|1.0|I lost interest in the movie in first half hour.  No interest in seeing it through due to being so slow and boring.  There was no belief in the characters or any real interest in the story.  Not even worth spending my time writing a full review.  Better things to do with my time than watch this movie.
B0013AUE3O|2.0|...I forgot this is the one where the idiot actually hums aloud while he's playing.<br /><br />Ten dollars down the drain.<br /><br />Oh well...
B0079K4WEE|5.0|Susan is a scientist who lives in her own little world, her entire life is devoted to research, while everything else is neglected. For Susan, it was all work and no play, until she meets Michael. A talented scientist meets a talented chef, and the sizzling romance begins. As one would expect, Susan's life begins to change, but so does the entire world she lives in. The more steamy the relationship, the more a new epidemic spreads. As the couple fall in love and share their feelings, people all around lose their sensory perception. As the romance become intense, the mysterious disease becomes more disturbing. The outcome is global chaos as the mystery continues. \\"PERFECT SENSE\\" is brilliant, powerful, romantic, and chilling. The acting is superb, and the story is both touching and thrilling. Highly recommended for romantic suspense lovers and thriller loves.
B0084YC5UC|5.0|Lots of great moments ,with Cooper discussing intense business matters while nonchalantly dunking a donut into steaming coffee. Don's reaction to Megan's friend's play about watching beer commercials while drinking beer and Peggy's joke about the Negron complex. Joan buzzed with an old comrade and listening to the second best rendition of the christmas waltz. Like that don smooth talked the salesman at the dealership into letting him borrow that hot red number for the day, so he could get the feel for the Jaguar. So he would know how to represent it. Just shows Don has not completely lost his mojo. It was nice to see Paul , although he looks oddly baby like almost bald, and I couldn't believe him and Harry were drooling over Latchmee. She looked like a flea motel

B002SF9YUM|5.0|You may say I am a Robert Pattinson fanatic.  I wanted to find a way to not be so obsessed by him.  Someone had posted that watching this movie would cure a Pattinson obsession.  I was amazed that this was such a good movie.  After watching it, I dug further to find more about Dali, Lorca and Bunuel and the era.  I thought Javier Beltran was wonderful; I love watching this movie.  Amazon did a great job in delivering it on time in great condition and it was so easy to order.<br />Thanks, Amazon!
B0086700CM|5.0|My friend and i have been waiting for months to play his game and now we can!!!!! We r OBBSSED WITH IT!!!:)

B0086700CM|5.0|It's a perfect game without any backhanded pressure or need to buy things if you don't want to or, are satisfied with the free version.
B0071MV540|1.0|All of that talent and this is all they could come up with?  I wanted to like this and call the critics wrong, but they were right... this sucks.  And I'm a Ben Stiller fan, I'm an Eddie Murphy Fan, I'm a Matthew Broderick fan!  When I saw the $.99 rental price I had a feeling something was wrong, and it sure was.  I can't put my finger on it, but I was hoping that if it wasn't funny it would be fun, but it wasn't fun.  While I think there were some clever things during the actual robbery, it wasn't enough to save the movie.  Had I seen this in the theater I would've been upset and would've considered asking for my $12 back.  I hope Ben Stiller's \\"Neighborhood Watch\\" is better when it comes out.
B0085776BG|5.0|We enjoyed this movie it was well acted and a great history lesson how everybody played a part in the freedom of this great country.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the first review I've ever written because this game is awesome!! It is so addicting and I just can't get enough of it! Constantly changing and keeping me entertained! Download it, you won't regret it!!

B007ZKY7XO|3.0|I bought this album on the strength of Night Work and its catchy tunes and great lyrics. I heard a preview of Shady Love which I really didn't like, but I liked the preview I heard of Only The Horses, so I decided to go for it. Now that I have listened to it, I guess I am a bit disappointed because there are no immediately catchy tunes. The best song on the disc is Only The Horses. There are  some fairly good tunes that could have used some more polishing (Baby Come Home, Inevitable, San Luis Obispo & Year Of Living Dangerously) and frankly some hip hop tunes that shows the Scissor Sisters are trying to appeal to top 40 radio (Let's Have a KIKI and Shady Love). The rest are just passable but not hummable, like the ones on Night Work were. At least the cover art is tasteful and won't put anybody off.
B005HSL626|5.0|I haven't played this in a long time but it's goten better.<br />and with the new fruit facts it's wicked.<br /><br />it's a cool game for the pass time whene there's nothing to do.

B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is the BEST game ever! I've never been so addicted to running for my life :) I absolutely love this game and I would play it all the time if I could.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Totally love this app. I especially love to listen to the Bible before I go to bed. this is a one of a kind app.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|After I got tickets to see Jack White, I noticed the Alabama Shakes were opening for him. Since I had never heard of them, I started listening to their stuff on YouTube. I was impressed at their style and at Brittney's voice. Then, I heard them live and was completely blown away by how great they are. They played a perfect set that was filled with emotion. This band will be around for a while, and they will only get better with time. That's exciting considering how good they already are.
B0086700CM|5.0|I thought it was really neat how they had it for ipod and now they have it for kindle fire for free!! I mean what is better than free!! nothing obviously :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i wasnt so sure how id like it before reading it but once i got the sample i couldnt put it down i just had to have the books! i loved loved loved it!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so fun. Its also addictive. Its so fun to run through the temple and buy new characters I love it
0345803485|1.0|Re: book - Fifty Shades of Grey....<br /><br />I just bought and read it.<br /><br />Oh the literary shame!!!  I feel almost as bad as when I bought the Twilight series and read THEM (actually I do feel worse - Twilight was more fun).<br /><br />Twilight was for that 12 year old girl (alive in most of us) who likes romantic stories about vampires and werewolves. Twilight was poorly written and truly crap literature but silly fun never-the-less.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey (which apparently started out as fanfic for Twilight) is women's fantasy erotica (poorly written - even the author admits THAT) flavored with BDSM elements.  Not for the 12 year old girl in all of us since the book consists mostly of descriptive sex scenes between really annoying characters.  By the end of the book - I was ready to scream from the redundant dialogue.  ARGGGHHHHHH.... This book is overpriced crap.  I can't believe I fell for it.  Oh well, at least I know to avoid the 2nd and 3rd books - I'd probably be ready to throw my Kindle out the window if I had to read those. I might have spent $2.99 tops for this (and would still have complained and been annoyed even at THAT price point).<br /><br />My twenty cents (minus the $9.99 I spent on this piece of whoo whoo).<br /><br />Please note - there are better written and less expensive works out there if you want to explore the themes in this book. But if you want to support the publisher - who in my opinion didn't provide any editing guidance to the author - go right ahead.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|This guy is excellent not matter what he does. He is a guitar expert and knows how to blend blues with rock. This cd is great, if you like the blues or not. He ooozes talent, plays the heck (and I mean the heck!)out of the guitar and has a great voice also. I recommend this cd to all who like blues or blues rock. It has great songs. Some cover songs and some written by Joe Bonamassa. All are good, in my opinion!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is defenitley the first game that I have ever gotten addicted to. I believe that with other games I always got Boers but the objectives keep you going also thank you for getting temple run to the kindle fire now I don't feel left out when my friends are playing temple run so I very much so encourage u to download this all and it has no ckmplants from me so give it a try after alms it is free!!
0307730697|4.0|This book is more about a Seal \\"man\\" than a Seal \\"mission\\". Books by Seal operators such as Lutrell and Wasdin were more of \\"mission\\" books. Which is not meant as a bad thing because Fearless told us about a great  Warrior's life. My only beef was a bit too much jumping into time and back. Otherwise, a recommended read.<br /><br />Finally, I feel bad for these Seal's (and Nightstalkers etc.) wives and girlfriends. While they are part of what I consider a \\"superstar's\\" life, they reap few, if any, of the financial or other material rewards found in other superstars (like sports) life or in death.
B007NESBK2|5.0|As a document of Sade's 2011 World Tour, this Blu-Ray more than gets the job done.  Sophie Muller's direction here is like everything she does:  classy, classic, romantic, and modern.  Her camera operators do a terrific job of capturing the total package that this concert experience represented.  Everything from the set design, lighting, laser work, stagecraft, and of course the music are intelligently presented and seamlessly integrated, producing a cumulative impact that in its live incarnation is emotionally very potent and significant.<br /><br />All of the players get ample amounts of shine.  Their camaraderie, respect and love for one another is on full and unapologetic display.  What is also clear is the genuine sense of joy and appreciation Sade have for their fans.  Regrettably, it is increasingly rare for people this beautiful and accomplished to be this down to earth, a trait that remains one of this band's enduring strengths.  One also gets the sense that the band members also understand the times in which they and we live; they understand the place of their art in this world and appreciate their responsibility to furnish us with it.<br /><br />Nothing can of course replace the experience of watching Sade live, but if you saw the band during the 2011 live tour, this Blu-Ray will more than put a smile on your face, you just might find some goose bumps on your skin and the chill down your spine happening all over again.  If you did not have the fortune of seeing Sade live in 2011, this Blu-Ray will help you appreciate what all of the hullabaloo was about.
B0036SUQWA|3.0|George Clooney and Ewan McGregor in the same film makes it automatically interesting. This movie is hard to follow at times, but it is interesting and makes some good points. There are some fun bits of dialogue which I won't share because it's better just to watch the film and experience it for yourself. - There's also a book. I plan to read it at some point.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|Nothing like the original. I found myself wishing it were the movie version and wanting more of the same wonderful music but was disappointed.
B0072IVGZG|3.0|As a hard-core Cult fan, I must admit I was tremendously excited when I found out we would be getting some new music from Billy Duffy and Ian Astbury in 2012, and I picked this up the day it came out.  But I've held off posting a review until I had a few more listens to it, to see if my thinking on this would evolve.<br /><br />The bottom line:  This is definitely NOT a return to form for the Cult [what does that mean anyway--unlike a lot of people on here, I LOVED their last CD, \\"Born Into This\\" and thought it was their best work since their self-titled CD, \\"The Cult\\" the pinnacle of their great body of music ([[ASIN:B0000085N3 Cult]])].  \\"Choice Of Weapon\\" is enjoyable because it's a big plus to hear new music from this great band.  But let's be honest with ourselves, this is *far* from their best work.<br /><br />I think the big problem I have with this CD is that it's the first Cult CD I've listened to where I felt that the music was re-treading familiar ground, but nowhere near as successfully.  I think it's fair to say that up until \\"Choice of Weapon,\\" one could justifiably make the statement that the Cult has never made the same CD twice.  But I don't think you can say that here.  Throughout this disc, I keep hearing echoes of \\"Sonic Temple\\" and \\"Electric\\" and even \\"Between Good And Evil.\\" But not in a way that builds upon what was done earlier, instead just echoing what we've already heard before.  The first two songs on the CD are probably the best tracks, and then it all settles into indistinct mediocrity.<br /><br />Ian Astbury doesn't sound so good on this CD.  Granted, he's not a young pup these days, but there is a noticeable drop-off in the quality of his voice between \\"Born Into This\\" and \\"Choice Of Weapon\\" which is sad to hear (although understandable).  Voices don't last forever.<br /><br />Also, it needs to be said that the \\"sound\\" on this CD is a huge disappointment.  It's a very compressed sound, and it doesn't show the band at its sonic best for sure.  A professional audio engineer I know told me that a lot of new recordings being made today are coming with compressed sound so that when they are turned into .mp3 tracks, they don't sound a whole lot different.  What a shame if that's what was going on here.  Regardless, it's too bad that more care was not put into making this sound first-rate (even if the material is not).<br /><br />I'm going to check back on this review in a few weeks to see if this grows on me.  But with a week of listening under my belt, I have to say, so far my initial reaction to \\"Choice Of Weapon\\"--yes, one of disappointment--has unfortunately been reinforced with repeated listens.  I wish it were otherwise.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Three months later, I have to say, I wouldn't change a word in my review.  For me, the telling thing is whether or not I keep listening to the CD, because if I'm listening to it, that means I like it.  This one fell off my radar pretty quickly, and I've never felt an urge to put it in.  Even without feeling compelled to hear it, I have put it on a few times over the last couple of months (and sort of forced the matter), and the resulting experiences only reinforced my initial thoughts on this--meh.  This is nothing special, from a band that has never done \\"nothing special\\" before.

B004XCUEXY|4.0|Foo Fighters are a great band to a great amount of people.  I liked learning a few new things in this doc that I didn't know about Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters before.  The first half of it I really enjoyed.  I started to get a bit bored when the whole Wasting Light pr0mo parts started.  I like Wasting Light.  But wouldn't consider it the landmark of their career.  Only my opinion.  Keep rockin Foo.
B007KYQIEQ|5.0|Leopold is just awesome. He is quite the gentleman. Too many good things in this movie to mention. You just need to watch it for yourself. Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman were terrific selections for the stars of this film.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Super funny.  I enjoyed learning about her career both past and present.  My favorite chapter was her letters in response to her fan mail- so sarcastic and witty!  Great for passing time on a plane or relaxing on a beach.
B0086700CM|5.0|got so addicting so fast, play it every chance i get. :)<br />hope you guys enjoy it too! :D :D
B0054JZC6E|3.0|yeah. The game is free if you don't buy the points. there are way too many sponsors and annoying ads which is what id be expecting. I knew they weren't gonna give 124 games free.<br />you have to buy more credits for real money if you want to unlock the game fast. that's well over $10.<br />The games are 4/5 stars but the ads drop it to a 3/5.
B0086700CM|2.0|I have been looking at some of these reviews and all I saw was great love it beast boss finally and so on... I personally. have never played the game before friends tell me they love it. I have watched them play the game. to me my opinion. what's the point of running in circles. I think it just wastses time. if you want to run in curled go for a run at the park! that's the problem with this generation. all we do is play video games. its boring. and you guys all wonder why your pasty white and look like toothpaste!
B0063GORYU|3.0|Normally the \\"spider solitaire\\" game is really amusing to fool around with but this one has a gimick that thakes all of the fun out of it...... every time you attempt to open the game, it brings up an unrelated window attempting ( I thind) to sell some product or other. once or twice of this is maybe ok but everytime ??? if I could get the darn thing off my Kindle in favor of a less commercialized model, I most certainly would.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this version of Oregon Trail really does remind me of the classic and I love it. I would recommend it if you are a kid at heart
B0086700CM|5.0|the game starts out with no bonuses and gradually thru hard work u gain more coins and gain new skills and characters that allow u a new spin on the endless paths u choose thru random regeneration. u have chosen wisely if u bought this game.

0393088774|5.0|Krugman is perhaps the poster boy for a Keynesian-style fix to today's economic problems. Simply put, government spending is the solution. The debt doesn't matter now, it should be resolved once the economy is growing again.<br /><br />Krugman elaborates on this argument clearly, using good anecodotal examples (the babysitters club is perhaps the best), rather than boring and technical economic jargon. If the austerity advocates have the advantage in terms of their simple 'the govt can't simply spend its way out of this problem', which appeals to the 'handbag economics' understanding of the typical member of the public - Krugman makes a good attempt at creating a similar layperson explanation as to why a Keynesian approach is actually common sense, and will work unlike the austerity approach. In short, if everyone saves and noone spends, there will be no demand for goods and services, and unemployment will increase. What works for the individual, doesn't work for society in other words. Simple enough.<br /><br />Krugman tackles all the austerity arguments convincingly and fairly (though not without a fair amount of vitriol). The political obstacles are obviously the biggest challenging to Krugman's prescription, but he doesn't focus too much on how they can be overcome, since they are outside the scope of the book.

B007C3TVNA|4.0|\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" is a 2011 British-American drama directed by Lynne Ramsay.  It follows Eva, played by Tida Swinton, as she struggles against the current that is her impassive and morbidly troubled son, Kevin.  Sharply wrought, I've not seen a film this striking in long while.<br /><br />I read the novel late last year and appreciated the idea but became disenchanted with the author by the book's end.  Her expansive vocabulary and scathingly written protagonist were initially addictive but I never quite was able to step out of the author and into her story - she reads as a bit pretentious and I wasn't entirely convinced that this was a character design.  Thus, it was occasionally tiring but I stuck it out and felt rewarded for doing so.  Fat trimmed, Shriver's story is uniquely disturbing and houses a startling conclusion that screamed to be stamped forever on celluloid.  Thankfully, the director's translation is exceptional.  I'm not familiar with Ramsay's work but I plan to be.  She cooked the novel down to its most fundamental elements and then handed it back in better shape than she found it.  The dialogue is minimal, the camerawork gorgeous, and the soundtrack is oddly brilliant.<br /><br />Call it a thriller.  I'm in.<br /><br />First and foremost, Eva was cast exceptionally well.  The part called for a woman worn and skeletal Tida Swinton's bulbous fish pupils bored through the role as if the character was written for her specifically.  Eva birthed a monster and Swinton exemplified the weight of this load beautifully.  They couldn't have found a more haunting actress; she absolutely made this film.<br /><br />I was also impressed with Ezra Miller as Kevin.  There were two children cast to play Kevin in his younger years and they stared as menacingly as needed, but it was Ezra that brought a chilled and convincing depth to the character.  His involvement here was a treat and I'll be watching for his future roles.<br /><br />The one actor I wasn't particularly impressed with, however, was John C. Reilly as Franklin.  I understand that he was drafted to play the naive' husband and father, but he just felt dopey and unbelievable to me.  I realize that they wanted to pull in a main name for the role, but I think he hurt the film by detracting from its focal point.  Someone with a lesser name, in my opinion, would have been a better fit.  Reilly's inclusion is my sole reason for not giving this film 5 stars.<br /><br />Still, if you're considering the purchase and are interested in the content, just do it.  This film's genre, often built clumsily around its little sociopaths, is dominated largely by blatant characters and flagrantly repetitive themes.  And it's getting old.  \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" is a step in a more admirable direction.  Without giving the story away, I'll advise that the subject matter is relevant and certainly worth your time.  I would warn you, however, that the synopsis attached doesn't quite convey how unsettling the content actually is.  The violence is subtle and tastefully executed but there are a few graphic scenes, so you're aware.  If you're hoping only for a poignant drama, proceed with caution.<br /><br />But I do highly recommend watching this movie - its message is sensational.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br /><br />- tparticularly impressed with, however, was John C.

0142421375|5.0|John Grisham is always a good read.  He could write commercials about fly paper, Jello pudding or bluejeans and make it sound interesting.  And his novels about a 13 year old wannabe lawyer are as fascinating as ever.  His prose is short and simple, obviously geared to younger readers, but I enjoyed the direct and clean writing.  It's classic Grisham and everyone will enjoy this new character and his exploits.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I like to form my own opinion about things instead of listening to the media or what people are saying about something, especially when it comes to books and movies.  As soon as I heard all of the hype surrounding this book, I knew I had to find out what it was all about.  I'll address the criticism I have heard and read.<br /><br />It's poorly written...True.  This is not a work of literature that is going to go down in history as a classic.  Let's just be honest.  It was written for entertainment purposes and it fills a genre that a lot of people like to read: romance.  I haven't read many romance novels that are brilliantly written. (If you have, please email the titles to me.)<br /><br />It's R-rated...True.  I wouldn't read this to children as a bedtime story or recommend it for anyone under the age of 18.  However, it's not worse than any other romance novel or R-rated movie I've ever seen.  I was half expecting to put it down after a few chapters based on the comments I've heard about how explicit it is.  Sometimes you just have to know what you're getting into.<br /><br />It's hard to put down...False.  I wasn't thoroughly engrossed by this book and I'm not particularly motivated to read the other books in the trilogy.  I probably will read them at some point when I'm looking for a mindless book to read on the beach.  I've heard people are reading all three books within a week and can't put it down even to drive or take care of their kids.  I just didn't get this vibe.<br /><br />Overall, it was a decent beach book.  The main storyline is interesting enough without all of the fluff.  It's not my favorite genre, so I obviously have a distorted opinion, but that's why it is my opinion.
1594203334|5.0|I have relatives whose kids are terribly behaved. Can't sit still? Okay, some kids are more energetic. Picky eating? Not all kids love portabello mushrooms in basil sauce. Crying? Maybe it's late and the kids are tired. But screaming at the dinner table? Running around the table bothering people? Constantly trying to climb onto his mother's lap, after she said \\"I don't have time to hold you now,\\" and having her give in to his crying? How the hell are people supposed to eat their dinner?<br /><br />\\"Bringin Up Bebe\\" is essentially about parents' rights; the right to a good night's sleep, the right to cook only one dinner, the right to NOT be a stay-at-home mom. Compared to American parents, the French ones seem to be on vacation. French babies cease waking up for feeds by age 6 months at the latest. The mothers go back to work within three months of having the baby. As for eating, French kids are fed well-prepared gourmet cooking; chicken nuggets and fish sticks are a taboo.<br /><br />Much of what we call \\"motherly love\\" or \\"mother child bonding\\" in the USA can border on co-dependency; it's as thought the mother needs to feel needed, so she encourages the child to want her all the time. Eventually she gets sick of the clinginess but can't detatch the clingy child. Take for instance a three year old who keeps going into his parents' room at night. You'd wonder, \\"how are mom & dad supposed to have sex with the kid sleeping in their bed?\\"<br /><br />The answer is, they probably can't.

0307719219|1.0|Forgive me for saying the following so forcefully, but despite this complaint being pervasive in other reviews here, it didn't register strongly enough with me.<br /><br />The intended audience I picture for this book is one where detail and sophistication must be sacrificed in favor of repetition, that is: Severe problems with both short-term and long-term memory. Uninterested in the topic, but being forced to listen. Below average intelligence and general knowledge (example: Will not know that Arizona is in the US). If this is not you--and I doubt it is--be prepared to endure a lot to find the sparse content of this long book.<br /><br />For comparison, this book is far worse than the typical \\"motivational\\" business book, a category that is infamous for books that are bloated with unnecessary repetition and that offer shallow and questionable analyses. In this book, it is not uncommon to encounter pages that have 2-3 repetitions of the book's mantra, with yet more instances a few pages on. Sometimes it will go on for multiple pages repeating what had just been said immediately before. And examples are cited repeatedly as if new. If this were a lecture, you could go out, make some phone calls, get a pizza and come back without having missed anything.<br /><br />----<br />Most of the examples are of the form that chooses an under-performing economy and _declares_ it to be the result of \\"extractive\\" policies. Extractive policies cover a wide range--expropriation, extortion/bribery, excessive taxation,...--but there is rarely even an attempt to explore the details or complexities. Or to quantify. My expectation was that such considerations would have yielded interesting insights. The book treats extractive vs. inclusive policies as a binary choice, rather than a matter of degrees.<br /><br />The explanation of the examples are grossly over-simplified and too often get significant details wrong. See other reviews here for numerous examples. The book had the feel of \\"Don't let facts get in the way of the story.\\"<br /><br />This is a book where shallow analysis is the most you can expect, and you'll rarely get even that. Its critiques of other theories, such as [[ASIN:0393061310 Guns, Germs, and Steel:... by Jared Diamond]], involve creating strawmen that can be trivially demolished: The book exaggerates those books' claims that other factors were (highly) influential to the outcomes, portraying those claims as being that those factors were absolutely determinative, which the book can then dismiss with a single counter-example.<br /><br />One of the key tests of a theory is whether it can explain why seemingly similar situations produce different outcomes. Unfortunately, in multiple places in this book, the \\"explanation\\" of different outcomes is simply a _statement_ that the underlying situations must have had (unspecified) differences. For example, it claims that the greater freedom of the peasantry in western Europe after the Black Death flowed from the labor shortages the Plague created, but then acknowledges and waves-off that the similar situation in eastern Europe led to greater repression.<br /><br />Before committing to this book--I was about to be stuck for hours in a hospital waiting room--I quickly sampled some passages and found them to be exciting. But that turned out to be because they were evocative of my existing knowledge. When I actually read the passages, my intelligence was insulted. It was history dumbed way down, to the level of a big-picture, broad-survey course. Although the authors' professional specialties are Economics and Political Science, that is not reflected in the book: The explanations and analyses are unsophisticated/trivial -- what one might expect from students in introductory courses on these topics.<br /><br />While there are indeed some interesting passages, it is not worth plowing through all the rest to find them.<br /><br />Near the end of Chapter 5 (about 150 pages), I gave up on the book. The authors had lost all credibility with me and there was no reason for continuing patience with the book.<br /><br />-- Douglas B. Moran. The authors had lost all credibility with me and there was no reason for continuing patience with the book.<br /><br />-- Douglas B. Moran

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Was hesitant at first to read this book.  However,all the talk about it got me curious. So I downloaded Fifty Shades of Grey, book one.  Put preconceived notions behind and dove straight into Fifty Shades.  Introduced me to  something I have never given much thought.  I was so intrigued; glad I decided to read this book.  And it's not porn!  Give it a shot; there's a reason women (and men) are purchasing this book.<br /><br />E.L. James did a wonderful job introducing us to the characters.  Felt like I knew Anastasia and Christian.  Will definitly add E.L. James to my list of authors.

B00003CXXS|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />  Jurassic Park III (hereafter JPIII) is essentially JPI or JPII without the excessive environmental, industrial, and genetic ethical moralizing.  JPIII is simply content to pit humans vs. dinosaurs as the humans seek to escape the dinosaur domain alive, and does so, as I said in the title, efficiently, confidently, and entertainingly.  Unlike the first sequel, which gave us the brave but bemused and not dinosaur-savvy Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) JPIII has the good sense to reintroduce rugged, resourceful, Indiana-Jones-like paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant in a latest attempt to save someone from dinosaur-infested Isla Sorna.  That someone is resourceful, plucky 12-year old survivalist Eric Kirby (Trevor Morgan), stranded by a parasailing mishap.  Eric is certainly a refreshing improvement upon the first sequel's whiny, peevish Kelly (Vanessa Chester). A third plus, at least initially, is Dr. Grant's able, young, handsome graduate student assistant Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola), who comes along for the rescue attempt.<br /><br />  Somewhat unfortunately, JPIII counterbalances these competent characters with Eric's nondescript parents: Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) who poses as a wealthy businessman willing to subsidize Dr. Grant's research in exchange for his son's rescue, and Amanda Kirby (T&eacute;a Leoni), Paul's tenderfoot ex-wife.  Both participate in the rescue, even after Paul reveals he is merely a hardware store owner, and Dr. Grant exasperatedly punches him for the hoax.<br /><br />  Off the quartet goes to Isla Sorna, where they are, naturally, stranded when a gigantic carnivorous Spinosaurus dismantles their aircraft and slays the mercenaries accompanying the group for protection.  Despite their encounters with the Spinosaurus and T-rex, the latter which is killed in a vicious knockdown battle, the quartet becomes a quintet when they find Eric quite alive and quite well near an enormous aviary.  The Spinosaurus was the first new angle in JPIII, the second is the eventual discovery of towering winged Pteranodons nesting within the aviary.  The Pteranodons chase them as well.  The group's progress is impeded by Eric's out-of-their-element parents, and, surprisingly, by Billy's appropriation of velociraptor eggs in a misguided attempt to fund Dr. Grant's research. Dr. Grant discovers the theft and severely chides Billy as no better than an avaricious corporate suit.  Billy redeems himself by using a parasail to save Eric from a pteranodon's clutches and disappearing into a stream.  The remaining group drive off the attacking Spinosaur with a crane and a boat fire, escape a surrounding pack of velociraptors by communicating with a shell that simulates their cries and giving back their eggs, and manage to contact Dr. Ellie Satler (Laura Dern) with an elusive cell phone for help in getting off the island.  They get off the island, find Billy injured but safe, and see the freed pteranodons fly off the island for a possible third sequel.<br /><br />  I liked JPIII because it is a stripped-down, just-long-enough, straightforward dinosaur adventure.  Furthermore, we learn more about more dinosaurs (carnivores and herbivores) and realize they are far more than villains that chase and eat people.  Also, the characters, even Eric's stereotypically clueless parents, test their mettle and will for survival and eventually earn our respect.  Finally, the CGI beasties are as awe-inspiring as ever and advance in our estimation because of Dr. Grant's scholarly admiration of them.  One can find lapses in JPIII, such as the T-Rex's willingness to leave the carcass it's feeding on to chase little humans, and a 40-pound pteranodon's questionable ability to pick up an 80-pound kid (besides pteranodons are fish-eaters).  Nevertheless, JPIII is a thrilling, suspenseful ride (especially the sequence when Dr. Grant desperately calls Ellie on the slippery cell phone, gets her 3-year old son instead, and tries to get the Barney-distracted child to get mommy on the line). And yes, it's much better and more intelligent than The Lost World, and on a par with the first Jurassic Park.<br /><br />P.S.:  After three \\"Jurassic Park\\" movies, what's left for the putative third sequel to cover?  Okay, we have the escaped pteranodons.  But is that enough?  All I can think of is that unscrupulous InGen scientists somehow obtain the dinosaur zygotes from the first movie, perform some cross-breeding on the mainland, and create new dinosaur hybrids, including humanoid dinosaurs (from the velociraptor embryos).and tries to get the Barney-distracted child to get mommy on the line).

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is outstandingly written, and extremely hard to set down. This novel is a perfect book for any age, boy or girl, and exceeds in keeping the reader on the edge of his/her seat. Katniss Everdeen is a perfect role model and throughout the story continuously proves that spirit is greater than strength. This futuristic novel takes place after the destruction of North America, and expresses fictional cruelties asserted by the \\"evil\\" capitol. Katniss goes above and beyond the expectations from all the other tributes competing in the Hunger Games, and proves she should not be labeled weak due to her home in district 12. This exciting book continuously strikes the fearful question into the reader of: could our world turn out to be this cruel in the future? Although Katniss may come off as militant in the beginning of the story, she shows a kind heart towards her pal Peeta by nursing him back to health and helping him survive in the Hunger Games. Author Suzanne Collins creates an amazing ending to the story by leaving suspense and love between both Katniss and Peeta. The Hunger Games is a terrific book, and I recommend it to everyone, but read soon so you can experience the second book titled Catching Fire.

0393327345|5.0|Fight Club is a brilliantly written novel by Chuck Palahniuk about an unnamed narrator and his close friend Tyler Durden. Through insomnia, insanity, illegality, and black eyes, Palahniuk takes readers on a roller coaster of suspense and turmoil. If the title, \\"Fight Club\\", turns you off to the book, think again. This book is not about fighting. While the narrator and Tyler may meet at the fight club weekly, that is not the main theme of the book. Fight Club is a clever, dark, and beautiful piece of literature that can be enjoyed by fighters and pacifists. I would recommend this to any reader older than 14 who enjoys dark plots. If vulgarity, violence, or sexual content make you uncomfortable, I would suggest you do not purchase this book. If you enjoy comedy, suspense, action, detail, and a mostly happy ending, purchase this book immediately. Fight Club quickly became my favorite book, and it was nearly impossible to put down. I was wanting more even when I finished the book! Lastly and most importantly, do not watch the movie before reading this book! The director of Fight Club did an excellent job of portraying the story accurately, but I still HIGHLY suggest that you read it first. Buy this book!<br /><br />Evan Stuart

1933633867|5.0|I have read this book with great interest, both theoretical and practical. The only other book I have read which emphasized so strongly the credit nature of money, much before coinage was invented, was Spengler's Decline of the West. There is much wrong in that book, but it contains a spectacularly ironic comparison of Egyptian and Greek/Roman attitudes towards money (he didn't know much about Sumer) - and a characterization of modern money as \\"force fields generated by individuals\\" (I am paraphrasing from memory).<br /><br />The parts of \\"Debt...\\" I found most practically interesting are on state-free markets in Islamic culture (I loved Mez's Renaissance of Islam when I read it) and restrictions to credit in India and China. These seem at least as relevant to our current situation as the jubilee the author proposes, but have not been nearly as much a focus of discussion. From my vantage point of a layperson very interested in world history, they seemed convincing, but I would like to see more well-founded criticism of these parts of the book.<br /><br />Other reviews have been mostly quite positive (with the reviewer often admitting ignorance of anthropology and world history), while criticism has concentrated on the last few pages, especially on American empire. I am not really interested in this, because, as the author emphasizes, the true data on contemporary politics are not available to the public. I do wish the book (a 2nd edition?) would expand on the predominance of unfree labor in 20th century capitalism, as my French is too slow for the only book cited for this hypothesis.

B003K16P3M|3.0|This was a good beach read book. The world is interesting and the \\"Graces\\" concept was nice. The writing and the characterization were fairly well done. There are a ton of really positive reviews on this book so I'll just write about the two problems I had with it.<br /><br />Problem one: the plot was really choppy. The book is divided into three sections and the plot is divided into three sections as well. The confrontation with the evil bad guy that the story was (kind of) building towards fizzled. It was anticlamactic. It was over in one sentence. Then another 20% (I was reading on my Kindle)at least of the book went about wrapping things up. All in all, not a horrible problem for a book. If you can suspend belief and accept that Katsa's Grace allows her to do ANYTHING that she wants to do then you'll be able to enjoy the plot.<br /><br />Problem two was a bigger issue for me: In the beginning of the book Katsa says that she will never marry or have children. She gives as her reason the thoughts that she doesn't feel at all maternal towards babies or kids and she doesn't want to give control of her life to some man. At the time she says this she has never been in love and can be excused for feeling so childishly. As the book progresses she falls in love and one would expect her to change her views. Instead, her love becomes her lover and they both say that they are ok with never marrying. Why? Katsa says because she doesn't need to cling to him like a barnacle to make sure that he always remains hers and never falls in love with someone else.<br /><br />Now, either Katsa and Po are not truly in love and are only in lustful infatuation with each other, or the author is not married and has no idea of what love really is. (Wild generalization on my part, I know. There could be countless other reasons for the author moving this way with the plot. Those were the only two that came to my mind.) Anyone who can say that the commitment of marriage is about forcing the other person to stay with you, doesn't understand love. Marriage is about promising the person you love that YOU will be faithful. That you are making a choice that is not based solely on emotion. That you realize that your emotions will change; some days you will fight, some days you will drive each other crazy, some days you will not want to even talk to each other, but that ring on your finger means that you have chosen to work through things and love that person no matter what. Marriage is about selfless love. Love without commitment is selfish.<br /><br />Now, don't even get me started on children. I am more willing to understand people who say they don't want kids, but again, it's a selfish statement. Not everyone is blessed with children, but children ARE a blessing and as a parent I can only look with pity on people who are missing out becasue they are too scared to give up their \\"freedom.\\"er person to stay with you, doesn't understand love.

I was hooked after the first one.  Lots of late nights and very little housework got done while I was reading.  I've encouraged a few of my friends to read the books as it really is a great love story.  I was head over heels for Christian after reading these.  Doesn't every wife want the romance that he so easily gave to Anastasia?  Anyways, since finishing, it's back to reality and housework.  I've decided I may read the books again this winter, that is, if I can get them back from my friends and family.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wow. The title is exactly right -- this book is an absolute WONDER. It's powerfully emotional on a multitude of levels, all of them beautiful and poignant.

0316044695|3.0|Everyone has heard about \\"The Greatest Generation\\" but the truth is there are heroes in our current generation as well. And make no mistake, Marcus Luttrell is a hero, as are his three teammates, the nineteen members of the rescue Chinook, and all the others who participated in that mission. The narrative by Luttrell of the mission and his gritty determination to survive leave you with an appeciation for the level of courage and dedication required to be a member of that most elite of services. The book is an awe-inspiring, quick and fast-paced read, and difficult to put down once you've started reading it.<br /><br />That being said, the political comments made by Luttrell detract from the flow of the book, and are a distraction from the service of all those who participated in the mission. Luttrell's political pursuasion is unmistakable, but the Americans who sent soldiers like Luttrell off to the war in Afghanistan stood shoulder-to-shoulder in support of that mission, and were not just of one political party. Luttrell's disgust for rules-of-engagement that were determined by politicians is wholly understandable; after reading his book however (\\"Luttrell had come to Afghanistan 'to kill every SOB we could find'\\"), I shudder to think what those rules would look like if they were made by warriors such as himself.<br /><br />If you can look past the political statements (or have the same political leanings as Luttrell), the book is a gripping story and a good read.

B00846REIS|4.0|While it is too similar to 50 Shades in many ways, there is one difference that I liked.  Ana in 50 did not come from money and it was just too coincidental that she would fall right in with a millionaire.  But Eva in Crossfire came from money and that was more believable to me - they had more in common.  But if you are looking for something different, then these 2 books are basically the same.  The one thing that is terribly wrong with Eva in this book is that she calls Gideon \\"ace\\".  For crying out loud, is that the only name the author could come up with?  It just ruined the dialogue every time she said it.  And lastly, Eva is shallow and hard to connect with and you can't get the emotional trauma she must have experienced as a child from the way she is written.  She needs more depth.  It is almost like the author is a teenager who wrote Eva as though she were a teenager at times.  But the sex is good and adult-oriented so it gets 4 stars for that.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Wow. I don't even know where to start. This book absolutely positively blew me away. It might be the best book I have read this year - and I have read some awesome books. I honestly knew nothing about this book when I purchased it besides the fact that it had 4.9 out of 5 stars on amazon, with quite a few reviewers - and it was an independent book, therefore it fit my budget. It was worth 5 times what I paid for it. I laughed and cried throughout the book. I loved all the characters. I really felt what they felt. I'm not a huge fan of poetry, but I LOVED the slam poetry in this book. I don't want to give anything away because I knew nothing going into this book and it was so much better that way. Just pick up this book. It is awesome. I'm going to read the sequel right now.
0312641893|4.0|This book is an amazing take on the classic Cinderella fairy tale. Of course, it being a YA book, it does have elements of unrequited love, confusing emotions and a main character in discovery of herself, but it also has a lot more to bring to the table. Filled with sci-fi and fantasy, the book rears the imagination to show that not everything in the world is as it seems to be, and not everyone can be trusted. Cinder in her journey to self-discovery learns that she doesn't have to be just a cyborg, she could be something much greater! I'm really looking forward to reading the continuation of the series.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I remember first watching this movie in the theaters, and in the final scene, a man in the audience stands up, begins to utter a few expletives, and storms out of the theater. It was then that I realized how affective movies can be; for the good and the bad alike. Those who deny the afterlife will likely feel uneasy watching this movie in particular. And those who believe in the afterlife will likewise feel uneasy, watching the gradual destruction of a soul (the emperor's).<br /><br />What is most striking, is how good and evil are seemingly enfleshed into the two main characters, portraying one's descent into darkness, and the others ascent to glory. The former possessed all the riches of the world, and the latter possessed nothing--humbled to a slave--and yet was in the end glorified while the other forgotten. The parallels to the spiritual life are evident, notwithstanding the extreme violence.<br /><br />**NOTE: There is a deleted scene in the DVD extras of Maximus witnessing Christians being fed to the lions in the Colosseum--something which historically occurred under the reign of emperor Marcus Aurelius (as well as numerous other emperors). As shown in the scene, the Christians would kneel down to pray and sing psalms while awaiting their slaughter. Go to google and type in \\"The Christian Martyr's Last Prayer\\" to see an accurate painting of this, with the priest intoning the psalms surrounded by Christians in prayer.***
B0086700CM|5.0|every time I turn my kindle on I play this! really fun and addictive app that I recommend 2 u!!
B003VANOFY|3.0|Comfort: I sometimes game for up to 8 hours in a sitting and these remain comfortable, even over my glasses. The padding has started tearing where they sit over my frames, but not unreasonable given the usage.<br /><br />Sound quality: Plays 7.1 sound channels. Does NOT effectively replicate surround sound. I have found no discernable difference between playing audio at 7.1 or as basic stereo. Otherwise, sound quality is great. Just don't expect actual surround sound.<br /><br />Battery life: Battery lasts most sessions, however the indicator is WAY off. It will start beeping at me notifying me that \\"battery life has one hour remaining\\", however it continues to last 3 or more hours. Inconvenient that it's trained me to ignore the notifications and so it shuts down at inopportune times.<br /><br />Connectivity: The range on the headphones is excellent. My base is located on the 2nd storey and I am free to roam all throughout the house, including the basement. I have never taken them outside to test its true range, but certainly more than adequate. EXCEPT sporadically it has connectivity issues even when I'm sitting 2 feet away from the base. Very disruptive when it's cutting in and out, or disrupting all communication because it's generating noise on my playback and mic line.<br /><br />Durability: The ear cup rotation joint is stated to be made of aircraft-grade aluminum alloy. Apparently aircrafts can not withstand the pressure of my head for less than 1000 hours, because the rotation joint is exactly what's broken on my headset.<br /><br />Bonuses: 3 programmable buttons are semi-useful. Works effectively with keybinds, but if you want to use it to control your music, you are limited to programs that have had a specific addon written for it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider exercises your brain more than \\"ordinary \\" solitaire.  I'm only doing 2 suits so far,  hope I can continue to build.  The ads are not a problem. Enjoy!
B0086700CM|5.0|The game is freaking awesome no lagging and no mess ups on kindle fire its just plain good You need to hurry up and get it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I  really enjoyed this application. Its very easy to use and can be very addictive.  Great for waiting rooms and traffic jams.
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever. i always played it on my freinds ipod, but now i can have it on my kindle fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had this game on my iphone and loved it! I waited so long for it to come out for my kindle and it finally did!
B0076UXKDG|1.0|Really, Nikon? You sell a grip for that much? It should not even be reviewed, but rather just plainly ignored. Let them choke on the overstock of this product.
0985081821|5.0|I bought The Forever Girl because it was cheap. ($0.99)<br /><br />I did not expect to like this book as much as I did.<br />When I read it, I found it to be a great read. Sophia, who is strong character, evolved nicely as I read the story. Charles is a great leading man to have. She is a Wiccan who is struggling with with a few in her community and her own Mother about her Faith. Some in her town even want her gone. Sophia is a 22 year old woman who has finished college and is looking for more in her life. She finds a whole other world and love. Even a few new friends and enemies.<br />It's cliche in the fact that she is someone the other world has been waiting for to come forth and save them. Everyone though loves a new twist on things.<br /><br />This is a paranormal romance/mystery and I really enjoyed it. So buy and enjoy.<br /><br />I suggest this book to anyone looking for something new to read.
B005MYWZIO|5.0|Awesome album! Michael brings fire from beginning to the end. A must buy for any R&B or Soul fan. This guy sounds like he is right out of 1965. However don't buy your copy from MusicMars-CDs. I bought my first copy through them and received a damaged product. Not much care on there end to ensure a quality product. There are several other vendors with competitive pricing and I suggest going with one of them.
B0086700CM|3.0|I have the kindle fire and an iphone so I absolutely love temple run but it freezes a lot and is slow
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you are looking to have your Kindle Fire be your Bible, this is the App for you.  Just be sure to download some of the Bibles in case you don't have Wifi.  But, the looking up verses, etc is so much easier on the Fire's touchscreen.  Also has great reading plans.  And, you can jump between versions of the Bible with just a couple of touches--as opposed to having to relook up the reference from scratch.
B007IX383I|5.0|Stumbled across Britain's Anathema 3 years ago. Like Porcupine Tree and vaguely similar bands, inevitably put in the \\"Metal \\" racks. Thank the contemporary music deities for Amazon.<br /><br />My initial hearings of this formidable work were bracketted by WHWs \\"Of Empires Forlorn\\", and Swallow the Sun's \\"Emerald Forest..\\". This juxtapositioning works for this reviewer.<br /><br />I'd have to say that the harsh edges and angularity of earlier Anathema works seems to have given way to a more accessible soundscape. Dare one say, commercial.<br />Never-the-less, there are, in proper measures, great power, balladry, drama, contemplation and integrity<br /><br />The opening tracks, \\"Untouchable, 1 & 2\\", open with an almost folky acoustic ambience, which gives way to a driving rock anthem, thence to a gentler interlude by way of boy/girl duet, then soaring instrumental and closing gently. Wonderful.<br /><br />\\"The Gathering of the Clouds\\" continues with this general scheme, with pulsating and swirling orchestral components tastefully placed. That reads blandly, but one can't gush continuously!<br /><br />Lee Douglas' bright vocal points up \\"Lightning Song\\", which again slides into great hard rock from a gentle beginning. The band may well be seeking a wider audience, but by golly, it's brilliant.<br />Written here, it may appear formulaic, but the listening reveals a certain honesty in the vocals,and great art in the finished song(s)<br /><br />\\"Sunlight\\" follows in the true path, with David Cavanagh taking lead voice. There is more than a hint of \\"the Edge\\" in the guitar sound.<br /><br />Yet, just as we are settling into a particular musical language, \\"The Storm Before the Calm\\" reverts to what we might expect of this mob. A harsh chanting vocal, over a all of sound and electronica of sorts, and some arcane lyrics...the hints come later in the album. There is a percussive angularity here, at first, yet they can't keep the bleakness going, and it eventually settles intoan anthematic final third as a ray of hope...somewhat reminiscent of \\"Vienna\\" (but much better vocals)<br /><br />A very short \\"Beginning and the End\\" is surely one of the most dramatic rock songs ever,..plaintive heartfelt singing, wailing guitar, packing a lot into a true miniature masterpiece.<br />For years I'd wondered what \\"achingly beautiful\\" meant. Wonder no longer. Wishing for more, but it's all there!<br /><br />\\"The Lost Child\\"..a title one might see from Mr.Holopeinen and friends...but musically a world away, and from the same pod as most of the rest of the album. Great emotion in the vocals without being over-wrought, and brilliant symphonic rock instrumentation. A little like \\"Muse\\", with more soul, and less reaching for effect<br /><br />The closer, \\"Internal Landscapes\\" is the lyrical heart of the album, with a gracious monolog by one Joe Geraci as an explanatory note, interpolated cleverly.<br />Overall, the album is an antidote to Doom. Soaring, but not from depths, uplifting, even spiritual at some level.<br />Thank-you boys and girl, for this musical hope. Masterwork.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so fun everyone loves it.Once tou start playing you cant stop I suggest this app to anyone tou can buy new characters and upgrades with coins, which keeps you playing. Did I mention its free? :)
B0086700CM|5.0|it was very fun but there were a few glitches here and there but overall I loved the game it was fun and exiting
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the book will consider purchasing more books. I encourage others to try this venue of reading. good good good good

B007UXTG8M|5.0|I enjoyed the movie \\"Shame\\", with Michael Fessbender.  What happens to a victim of sexual abuse.[[ASIN:B007UXTG8M Shame]] The story developes as his sister played by Carry Mulligan comes for a stay. The both apparently are deeply effected by their past which the movie allows you to imagine what it must have been like.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|For those who were bludgeoned into submission by \\"In the Court....\\", and puzzled by the blandness of \\"In the Wake...\\", \\"Lizard\\" was even more perplexing when initially released in 1970.<br />Pointy rythms, discordances, (a not yet famous) Jon Anderson's elfin vocals, and strident mellotron, and a perception of discontinuity and stuff being chucked about by some musical poultrgeist!<br /><br />Enter Steven Wilson and digital wizzardry.<br /><br />Robert Fripp's unloved child become a prodigal son.<br />40 years later, I'm gratified that a true afficionado has taken this work  and created the most wondrous sonic make-over...every bit as good as the \\"Aqualung\\" effort.<br /><br />I agreed with the criticisms of Lizard at the outset, but maintained what some saw as a perverse love of it.<br />Steven Wilson has peered into the soul of this work, finding its true meaning, and made out of the master recordings more than its creator realized was there. A rare feat.<br /><br />The esentially percussive bases are preserved, but less harsh, the mellotron is less strident, and the improved resolution seems to have sharpened the vocals, especially Anderson's, without making them more than they need to be. I suggest the overall sonic balance is vastly improved, and much of what was previously easily missed, now comes forth to more rightful places. So many \\"I don't remember that\\" episodes.<br />Now all the instruments sparkle, and the previously difficult \\"Happy Families\\", and \\"Indoor Games\\" sound more like a good-time had by all. (still don't get the sickly laugh bit, though)<br />\\"Cirkus\\", \\"Lady of the dancing Water\\" and the title track shine as never before, and \\"Bolero\\" has every bit the legitimacy of Ravel's namesake work, in fact, I suggest more genuinely beautiful.<br /><br />This set comes as a CD with very recent remastering bit by bit from Mr Wilson, helpful notes from Mr Fripp, and the DVD several stereo or 5:1 formats for your delectation, . And Wonderment. If you ever shied away from this work..get this, and grock it now.shied away from this work..get this, and grock it now.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very addicting and fun but also hard at the same time. Temple run is a very exilerating game.
0439023521|5.0|I wanted to read this book before the movie came out. I had heard people talking about it, so I kind of just thought why not? When you hear it explained you think kids killing kids? So I was skeptically staring out, but of course it was very well written. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and biting my fingernails.<br /><br />I thought it showed what a strong woman Katniss is, and it is heart wrenching at parts. I would recommend it to anybody. I think the book is better than the movie, but the movie is pretty good at portraying the story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Having the Bible on my Kindle fire is great. I would like to see more &quot; offline&quot; versions available for download.  very good app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is very good and addictive. I cant put it down! I keep on trying to complete all the games :)

B0086700CM|5.0|I am pretty sure all of us have been waiting for this moment.  GET THE GAME!  It hasn't let me down yet.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it its only sometimes on kindle fire it doesn't pick up every move you make. but I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!!
B00023BLXK|5.0|I absolutely love, love, love this movie!!! I love the music, i love the story line and not to mention, i love the actors, especially Diego Luna!!! I also love this movie because it reminds me of my husband and I. I'm white and he's hispanic and my parents and family didn't approve of him at all in the beginning. It was hard when we first met bc people didn't think that we should be together and that we weren't going to make it. But we proved them all wrong. You can do anything for the one you love.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run soooooo much!!! it's actually okay on the kindle fire because the kindle fire fits in your hands. fav. game on the kindle!!!
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|An album full of brilliant songs, the quality is exceptional. If you like Adele, you'll love this. Ferguson has an incredible, unique voice and a great song writing talent. Quite breathtaking in it's brilliance, this is not an album you'll wish you hadn't bought in a year, but one that will become a much lauded classic that you'll never tire of. Highly recommended.
B0066NA8CU|5.0|Pretty good show.  I finished all of Season 1 and am now halfway through with Season 2.  Good characters--both likeable and not.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun game but just like the other users say there are 2 main issues:<br />1) not being able to go back to home screen<br />2) having to update when trying to visit friends and about 95% of the time it still doesn't work
B001U9BRNE|4.0|I recently viewed on You Tube scenes from both this concert and the one Foster did after it.  I was entranced enough to want to buy the first one and if I liked it I would purchase the second.  Immediately I was impressed by the quality of the Blu-ray with it's perfect color and sharpness of picture.  On a large size TV I felt like I had a front row seat to the concert.  The audio was amazing, crystal clear and vibrant.<br /><br />While Foster proves to be witty and charming through out, it can be argued that this concert is an ego trip for him. Pretty much every performer talks about how wonderful he is particularly in a couple of videos which really have no place in the show and are most likely left over from a lifetime achievement tribute that was done for him.  In addition, he has a tendency to speak as though he's solely responsible for the success of some of the songs presented even though Foster's contribution was relatively negligible or he was part of a team. It's clear, however, that Foster adores everyone of the performers appearing and is having a blast going down memory lane with them.  Each person is well showcased and obviously is putting their heart and soul into the performance.  All in all if you can over look Foster's grandstanding it's an amazing experience.<br /><br />Needless to say, I bought \\"The Hit Man Returns\\" right after watching.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is superbly fun. I have no complaints about it except that it might be a bit too addictive. I can tell that I'll be wasting time away with this one for a while.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Wow! As good as it gets<br /><br />Could not put this down... Engaging characters from the get go. When I purchased this book I couldn't really believe there were only 5star ratings but after two chapters that misgiving was a distant memory. Having relatively recently rediscovered my love for this genre I have been consuming books by the iPad load. Game of Thrones got me restarted then I travelled through a few others that were appealing though not AMAZING like this is... Prince of Thorns (another newbie) is terrific (also worth downloading). My most recent set was the Riyria Revelations which I enjoyed but this is just outstanding. And such good value. Buy it now!! Then join with all the other happy readers as we eagerly awaiting book 2 :-)
B000QCQ9O8|5.0|I've read many of McEwan's books. He writes engrossing novels for intellectuals, and this book is no exception. His word choices and descriptions are exquisite. Unlike many writers who leave you observing plots from afar due to shallow writing, McEwan gets you into characters' heads.
B004A2U4V4|5.0|At age 50 I became a new fan of Bon Jovi. It is one of the best collections of soundtracks put together for a greatest hits album. Bon Jovi shows a range of artistic creativity. From, mellow, classical, country, to kick ass rock. AWESOME ALBUM!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Interesting Trilogy.  Enjoyed the series.  Wanted to read before seeing the movie.  Glad I read the books because as usual the book is better than the movie.

B006VFLIYK|3.0|I was surprised that a well educated author could write so poorly, using slang and other hackneyed  language choices.  The plot was contrived.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Loved this book. Really.  Thought it was funny though that my favorite character was the dog.  :) I can't wait to get into the 2nd book of the series.
B0083GOPSG|5.0|Great idea, production planning and execution, places \\"CHRONICLE\\" [My Opinion, of course] in the mix of the likes of the original: \\"FORBIDDEN PLANET, Howard Hawk's THE THING, and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL\\"; providing ground breaking motion picture SciFi, complete with thrills, action and steadily building drama--and suspense.<br /><br />The young Actors sell the stories superbly, and the Editor and Director must have spent countless hours modulating between fast, moderate, and normal Cuts. Integration of CGI is near perfection most of the time. \\"CHRONICLE\\" is a SciFi entertainment phenomena well worth enjoying in a group, or with friends...  --GBJ
B0086700CM|4.0|I'm So Happy Amazon Got This App. FINALY! :) The Only Thing Is That The Tilt Is Really Sensitive. So Its Kinda Difficult To Run without Running Into The Sides Of The Runway. On The Other Hand Ill Get Used To It And I Think EVERYONE Should Get This Game Because It Is Super Fun!

0385535139|4.0|Grisham is a prolific and entertaining author and he does it again with the Litigaors. In this story a litigator for a huge law firm has a nervous breakdown, goes to a bar and gets smashed, then while drunk approaches a two man firm down on its luck (for good reason)for a job. Of course, his brilliance is discovered and don't we find him battling the big firm and exiting victorious. While entertaining, I found myself wondering if I hadn't already seen the movie or read the book. Their just doesn't seem to be anything new and seems to me Grishams novels are starting to get stale with me.

B007MAETA8|3.0|This album sounds to much like Bob Seiger, the Allman brothers and other southern rock bands of the past. The problem for me is the other bands sound much better and were origional. This is not and is boring IMO.

0345803485|1.0|I picked this book up because of all the hype. Man am I sorry. This book is poorly written, emotionally & physically abusive & left me angry. Never have I ever wanted a man to treat me so terribly. No matter the money, charm & good looks, men should be respectful. Every 10 pages I was getting angry because of his controlling or abusive behavior. I contemplated giving up on it about 3/4 of the way through, and I wish I had. JUST TERRIBLE!!!

1416596585|4.0|It seems like ancient history now, but in the early days of the Internet - around 1997 or so - finding even the most basic information was a big problem. Yes, there were some crude search engines like AltaVista and Hotbot, but their effectiveness at turning up a useful website was spotty at best. If you DID find a good site, you had to be sure to bookmark it, because you might not be able to find it again. Your bookmark list grew huge.<br /><br />Then came a new search engine named Google with a remarkable knack for find a page that would answer your question. Users flocked to it and in less than a decade, Google would grow into one of the most powerful companies on the planet.<br /><br />In the book \\"In the Plex,\\" author Steven Levy helps explain how a company founded reluctantly by two Stanford graduate students became a force that has changed the way the world works and thinks.  Levy was given insider access to Google and offers up insightful, detailed accounts of how Google has come up with one brilliant innovation after another.<br /><br />The story of the early days of the company is one of the most interesting parts of the book.  Larry Page didn't want to create his own company, Levy explains, he just thought he had come up with a really good way of searching the Internet and that someone might like to buy his program. But several companies, including Yahoo, turned him down, and soon he and Sergey Brin were launching their own startup.<br /><br />After rushing to the forefront in search, Google made breakthroughs in online advertising with its AdWords and AdSense systems - crucial innovations because that allowed Google to make money (buckets of it).  Then followed a succession popular products like Gmail, Google Maps and Google Earth.  Less well-known are the company's flops - it actually developed a social media site, named Orkut, before Facebook, but failed to give it much support and it withered on the vine, Levy says.<br /><br />The Google workplace wasunlike no other, Levy explains. Workers zipped through hallways on roller skates, or bounced on giant balls in meetings. Engineers were king, and to encourage innovation, were told to spend 20% of their time on projects of their own devising. Structure and rigid lines of command were avoided, so that any worker could feel free to critique, even rip apart, someone else's work. On the Google campus, employees could eat free meals at an assortment of restaurants, see a doctor, get a massage, use the lap pool or play beach volleyball (some of these perks have since been cut back).<br /><br />Levy structures the book well, breaking the book into sections devoted to different products or issues. A long section on Google's troubles in China is interesting, another section on Google political involvements less so. There's a lot of names in here and it`s hard to keep them straight; it`s too bad there's no pictures.<br /><br />Levy has done meticulous work, but he may have suffered a bit from a writer's version of Stockholm Syndrome, sympathizing a too much with his subject. Levy consistently paints a picture of those that doubted Google or tried to stand its way as being too dense to understand the company's brilliance.<br /><br />In fact, Google HAS been brilliant in many ways, but Levy is far too myopic in a chapter on Google Books.  In launching an attempt to scan all the world's books and put them online, Google was remarkably oblivious to the obvious issues of copyright that would arise. Were they naïve? Or just flat-out arrogant? Sure enough, the Google Books project brought howls of protest from authors and publishers. Levy's description of the dispute is one-sided and he somehow buys into Google's argument that everyone should just quit their whining because an online book archive would be a darn cool thing. It's a rare weak moment in an otherwise well-done book.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I played it all the time on my friends Ipod so I was so excited when it came out on android. I have a kindle fire and I have been seeing a lot of reveiws mentioning glitches. My kindles about 6 months old and I haven't experienced any glitches with this game. I think that this game is awesome :)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Crossme is a very addictive and extremely fun game. It can be challenging and frustrating at times too. Highly recommend this.
B0086700CM|5.0|OMG! Finally! I have been waiting for this ever since I got my kindle!!!!!! Best game ever!!  one word to advice...get it!!!
0345803485|1.0|How on earth can a book that is so boring ,sell so well. The story is wafer thin, the sex scenes are meant to thrill, but are more or less the same apart from a few SM(?) exercises.<br />The main figures should be permanently sore, both literally and figuratively but just go on and on with their silly behaviour. The whole thing is an offense to your intelligence.<br />Don't buy this book and certainly not all three of them. It's a waste of money.

B0034G4P4Y|5.0|Somewhere in a European city, reporter/adventurer TinTin (voiced by Jamie Bell) just bought a model ship of a famous ship called \\"The Unicorn\\" yet some other person named Mr. Sakharin (Voiced and performed by Daniel Craig) wants that for a diabolical purpose. TinTin discovers that the model has a secret clue that leads to a great treasure buried somewhere years ago where he and his faithful dog Snowy get kidnapped while his 2 bumbling detective friends Thompson and Thompson (Voiced and performed by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) are trying to solve the mystery of the wallet theif that has been going around lately. TinTin meets an alcoholic captain named Archibald Haddock (Voiced and performed by Andy Serkis) as they team up to find other clues that can lead to the treasure.<br /><br />A beautifully rendered and complex yet hilarious animated adventure from Steven Spielberg and producer Peter Jackson with co-writer Edgar Wright that nicely adapts 3 TinTin comics into one movie. Since 1984 Spielberg obtained the rights for a TinTin movie but after years of waiting in 2008 he greenlighted the movie and used his friend James Cameron's Avatar technology for his movie as he decided to make a full length Motion Capture animated movie out of the beloved Herge comics. I am an American who grew up with the HBO cartoon in the early 90s as a kid and became a fan of the character as i knew someday they should do a movie on it, i saw this movie 4 times in theaters and loved it. WETA who did impressive work with Lord of the Rings, Avatar, King Kong and Rise of the Planet of the Apes has done yet another outstanding achievement this time but as a full length motion capture animated movie. This one is far better than what Robert Zemeckis attempted so far as the characters are fully realistic including no dead empty eyes but soul at last including realistic renderings on hair, skin including fuzz on skin, clothes, animals and all that as it's very impressive including using stretched chins/noses to bulb noses. The film co-stars Cary Elwes and Toby Jones, this is an outstanding achivement in animation and motion capture as it has action, laughs, fun and solid storytelling from Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray has flawless crystal picture and outstanding sound with a handful of extras like behind the scenes stuff and featurettes.ns/noses to bulb noses.

0307474259|5.0|I discovered this book from an article in Newsweek, and after reading Rethinking Thin earlier this year and being impressed by its scientific approach I decided to venture once more into the hotly-debated world of diet & nutrition where the potential for pseudo-science is high. Disclaimer: I'm not a nutritionist, nor a biologist. I read these topics with an open mind and a skeptical eye.<br /><br />Why We Get Fat by Gary Taubes spends the first 90% of the book explaining, with a higher-than-average amount of scientific detail, what happens in our bodies when we eat the things we do. The data is backed up by tested experiments and historical accounts. Many of the specifics are devoted to addressing and debunking some of the diet notions we hold to be true. Calories in, calories out is one example that is almost certainly false even though many still believe it.<br /><br />The diet in question is a no sugar, no starch approached, and the reasoning is based on what our pre-history ancestors subsisted on for thousands of years before we started refining and processing everything. The book doesn't advocate hunting your own meals or anything like that, but it does recommend avoiding those foods which have only been around a short time on the evolutionary scale, which is to say not enough time for our bodies to adapt.<br /><br />The last part of Why We Get Fat is instructional. This includes how to change your eating habits and some specifics on portions and meal recommendations. The science makes sense to me and I'm intrigued enough to try eating this way for a while.<br /><br />*** 3-month update *** I followed this plan to exact specifications for two months and then relaxed a few requirements while adding some occasional cheating in the last month. In a nutshell, this diet works. And to paraphrase the author, eating this way is no more a diet than a non-smoker is on a diet from cigarettes. We live in a sugar and starch world, but if you work to put a few good habits in place the rewards are worth it. I wasn't overweight when I began (according to my BMI), but I did lose 12 lbs in all--and 6 were lost in the first few weeks. Healthy eating was my goal; the weight loss was a positive side effect. I intend to continue on indefinitely.<br /><br />Some tips for sticking with it:<br /><br />- As expected, the first week is the hardest. I remember my body going through a carb withdrawal. It wasn't hunger, but more like a mourning period for a comfort I lost.<br /><br />- Having a plan is necessary to avoid the inevitable cravings. I ate the same breakfast, lunch and snack every day for weeks at the start. Suppers were similar but varied.<br /><br />- Keep snacks nearby at all times. My favorites are cheese and pepperoni slices or cucumber with chili lime salt. This isn't a calorie-restricted diet. By all means, eat when you're hungry!<br /><br />- Most people will not understand why you're doing this. Twice while ordering at a restaurant I had to repeat my order (please substitute salad greens for potatoes) when the waitress thought she heard me wrong. Also, there's the occasional joke from the grocer when I place mostly vegetables on the check-out counter.<br /><br />- You're grocery expense will increase, mine did about 33%, but your eating-out expenses should go down.<br /><br />*** 1 year+ update *** I'm a stubborn guy and I don't easily give up on things that work, even if they're hard. This diet is a lot of extra work, but the results don't lie so I soldier on. And after a year I've gotten used to it. I don't weigh myself as frequently anymore because my weight has plateaued at a very-healthy, middle-of-the-chart BMI level. I do cheat and eat sugar and carbs from time to time because the finer things of life are meant to be enjoyed, but these are the exceptions and not the norm. The best result for me is an overall improved feeling of wellness. Finishing a meal usually leaves me energized, not lethargic, and I've only had one instance of being ill since I started (a cold that lasted 2 days). What else is there to say? This is not a fad diet if applied correctly--small changes over time with sustained effort.ance of being ill since I started (a cold that lasted 2 days). What else is there to say?

B0086700CM|5.0|love it so much. all of a sudden my friends and cowrokers started playing it and it became an excellent time killer and conversation starter<br />compared to the iphone (and ipad) version, kindle version gives you more fun ironically because of its relatively less responsive screen sensor which helps you in turning left or right much easier without turning the bend prematurely and hitting the wall.

B0086700CM|5.0|I really love this app I always had to ask my older sisters for their iphones just to play this game and I always beat their high scores!!!!!! I love this app and recommend everyone should find a way to get it
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Great Book! Read it. It was really good. Interesting and fulfilling. The only bad thing to say it was a bit unrealistic in the characters reactions.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First book I have read and it kept my interest the whole time, just ordered the other two!! I recomend this book as it was erotic, funny, and sweet.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is the best game in the entire world. really  reckomend it.P.S do not let the monkeys get you.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|The Fiio E6 really surprised me. It adds just the right \\"punch\\" to my listening pleasure. Very satisfied. I would recommend it to anyone!
B0086700CM|4.0|Sometimes the game stutters and the runner won't respond to your finger swipe. Lots of times I've been on a great run and then die because he wouldn't jump even though I told him to. It's so frustrating!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, is set in a place called Panem which is the remaining United States that consists of 12 districts. Every year, once a year, a male and female from each district are chosen to participate in what is called the Hunger Games. This is a very intense competition where there can only be one winner among all 24 participants. The main character Katniss is representative of district 12, the poorest district. Katniss lives with her mother and younger sister and is mainly responsible for providing for her family, so this is a huge undertaking for her to fight. You will have to read to find out how she handles fighting for herself, while fighting an \\"on-scene\\" relationship with her partner, Peeta, goes.<br />  I absolutely loved the book. It was an easy read, and hard to put down once I started. It was very well written and she did a nice job of grabbing the reader's attention and keeping it throughout the whole book, as well as the whole series. As far as changes that I would go, I wouldn't change all that much. Maybe just the suspense level, and how to drag it on and not drag it on. Also the descriptive factor, and the battle part of the book. But like I said before, I think its very good and it does a real good job of setting up a dystopian world. Definitely raises the reader's awareness of how things could end up being. Overall I would rate the book a 5 out of 5.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the challenge of the short games and playing for points. even if I don't win I get something. yes I know as you go on and play more the games are more expensive but these games are free and challenge you to play more which is great.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun and really addicting to play with! Everything about it is excellent! You should highly consider purchasing this application!
B0086700CM|5.0|I used to play this on my friend's ipad and it is very addicting! I couldn't wait to get it in my kindle and I am very pleased with it. it doesn't always get what my fingers are trying to do burning love it. I strongly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has awakened in me ideas I had never entertained. A definite read. An excellent portrayal of how one life can completely change another in a single moment.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I first heard about these books from Entertainment Magazine.  I immediately went to Amazon and read the description and it really did not capture my interest at first glance.  I normally read paranormal romance.  So, I put it out of my mind for a while.  I recently found myself in a reading slump so I decided to check out the first book in this series, Fifty Shades of Grey.  At first, I was like, OMG, I am not sure I should be reading this because it is soooooo sexually explicit!  Definitely for adults only!!!  But, as I kept reading, I found myself getting so immersed in the story and getting to know the characters that I could not put this down!  I eagerly read all 3 books in this series over Memorial Day weekend.  Since there are so many reviews, I will not recap what the book is about.  I will just say that they are the most provocative, entertaining books I have read this year, and I read A LOT! Even if this is not your usual genre, you absolutely need to check this out!  If you do not like language, or explicit and over the top sexual content, you will most likely not make it through the first book. The ending to the series was wonderful!  It is amazing the journey these characters take together.  It is truly a story of overcoming adversity and how true love can heal.  I just wish there was some way to continue Ana and Christian's story because I enjoyed it so much!  I am just not sure how the author would do that since she did such a good job of tying up all loose ends and giving us great closure to the series.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is so addictive. it is so much fun to play! give it a try and you will love it too.
B0086700CM|5.0|im so glad they put this on the amazon aapp store. all my friends told me about it. now im addicted. #veryaddicting

B000003CMB|5.0|With two previous studio releases that failed to move on the charts, this is the record that put the Allman Brothers Band on the map. Gregg Allman said they went from living on $3 a day (before) to getting five digit weekly checks in the mail after \\"At Filmore East\\" was released.  Part of the success is due to the death of Duane Allman.  Why do artist get the recognition they deserve after they die.  This is the first Allman Brothers record to display their creative improvisation skills with the long Whippin' Post cut at over 23 minutes.  This album is a must have for every Rock, Blues, and Southern Rock fan.
B005LAIHGI|4.0|3.5 out of 5 stars for THE DICTATOR.<br /><br />Upfront time: I'm not one to fall for Sacha Baron Cohen's subversive humor or his sense of the outlandish. I'm left cold and unimpressed by his Ali G and his Borat and Br&uuml;no. But then there's Admiral General Aladeen, a thoroughly despicable, funky-bearded tyrant who somehow wormed his way into, if not my heart, then at least my good graces. Understandably, enormous chunks of human civilization will absolutely loathe THE DICTATOR, and be offended and outraged by it. But, as a wannabe anarchist (there's this nihilistic chick I'm trying to impress), I'm inclined to sort of dig this movie.<br /><br />In the oppressed and oppressively warm North African nation of Wadiya, Admiral General Aladeen rules with absolute abandon, if not with sagacity. His will unchecked, Aladeen subjects his people to his petty whims and cruelties. He doesn't think twice about ordering someone killed, however trivial the reason. He sleeps with world-famous celebrities, if you consider Megan Fox a celebrity. You get a hint of the sad little boy lurking inside Aladeen when, post-coital, he pleads with Megan Fox to linger for a cuddling session (Megan Fox rejects him and demands her goodie bag). Redemption thru hugs? What the-- is Cohen getting mushy?<br /><br />THE DICTATOR, despite the brutal subject matter, may be more mainstream than Cohen's other motion pictures. It certainly follows a more conventional plot trajectory than did BORAT or BRUNO. Ben Kingsley - I would say he's slumming but he hasn't done anything good in a while - plays Tahir, the rightful heir to the throne, except that he was passed over for Aladeen. Tahir is fed up with his second banana role and plots to overthrow the Wadiyan ruler. When one assassination attempt is foiled by a body double, Tahir convinces Aladeen to address the United Nations in New York, wherein another assassination would be staged. Except that this second stab also fails, leaving Aladeen shaven of his signature beard and wandering the streets of the Big Apple, unrecognized. Meanwhile, Tahir installs a dimwit body double in place, a puppet whose strings he pulls from the shadows.<br /><br />On the streets of Manhattan, epiphany doesn't strike Aladeen as much as it sidles up to him only to be violently punched in the Adam's apple. It's a chore overcoming a lifetime of prejudice and hatred. But then Aladeen runs into left-wing activist Zoey (Anna Faris) who believes that the dethroned dictator - or, as Aladeen introduces himself to her, \\"Allison Burgers\\" - is a persecuted dissident. She offers him a clerking job at her vegan, feminist food store in Brooklyn, an offer which he accepts once he learns that her store is catering for the hotel in which the traitorous Tahir and the pretend Aladeen are staying. See, Allison Burgers still aims to regain what's his. Then again, Zoey hasn't hugged him yet.<br /><br />Fair warning: Neither sensitive souls nor them humorless fuddy-duddies need come to the show. Sacha Baron Cohen's transgressions surface frequently and undilutedly. Scenes play out, colored with rampant obscenities and disgusting imagery. Regarding the scatological stuff, even the writers of BRIDESMAID are cringing. And yet here's a saving grace: THE DICTATOR is funny as hell. Another saving grace: Cohen drops several acute observations. Don't forget that this is a satire; somewhere, Jonathan Swift is showing solidarity, never mind that he's long dead. I don't know that Aladeen as a character is able to salvage the audience's good regard. The tone is too viciously satirical, the narrative not really grounded enough, that I ever felt Aladeen was an honest-to-gosh, full-blooded person. He comes off more as a cartoon figure, and, so, emotionally, I was never engaged. Still, there's a redeeming moment which momentarily invests me, when, after a panic attack followed by a particularly vile act committed by his accomplice, Aladeen scolds him: \\"Plan B was to have coffee and regroup - not to chop his head off!\\" Now, I didn't get a lump in my throat. But I almost did choke on a jujube.<br /><br />If Marvel movies haven't taught you yet, don't exit once the end credits roll. You'll miss out on some stuff. That is, if you've managed to stick around that long. Odds are, halfway thru the film, you'd probably already stormed out of the theater, appalled and disgusted and loudly denouncing Sacha Baron Cohen. I bet you need a hug.e and regroup - not to chop his head off!\\" Now, I didn't get a lump in my throat.

B0086700CM|2.0|i have the Nextbook, and this app works great on it except that it wont let me lean side to side to get coins or dodge holes /: PLEASE FIX!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game but some of the multiple games are really hard and frustrating to beat! I love the sushi game.
B004UID2LC|1.0|My anti-virus advised me to uninstall it because it was detected as malware. Do not install. I have a Kindle Fire.
B006X415GK|4.0|What a super idea to have a monochrome Frankie!<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this doll, especially the short hair and the neat colours (or lack thereof).<br /><br />I know quite a few people who have repainted this one and she does make a great OOAK project piece, but I plan to keep mine exactly as she arrived.<br /><br />Another good purchase, very happy camper.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I finished the book and am still waiting for the plot.  This book reminds me of an X rated movie with smut and more smut, but not much of anything else.  It's not even sexy when it happens.  Oh, yawn.  Here they go again! From a virgin to a sex maniac--Come on, get real!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is the third edition of this game that I have played and it is, without a doubt, the best. It's fast paced, completely addictive, and a blast to play. The graphics look great on my Android tablet and the game play is excellent.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|One of the best freemium games I have ever played! Glu credits are awarded randomly for wins, so it's possible to get rich just playing. Great graphics, upgradeable characters, and no princesses to rescue!
0757302661|5.0|This book was great!  I first bought the book to see if I was willing to pay for the class and was convinced.  So we took a local class and had 4 sessions.  I read on someones review, you are supposed to think of how long your labor will be - whatever number pops into your head and I just thought 6 hours.  I did face MANY skeptics before my birth who almost laughed at me because I said I wasn't using drugs and that my birth was going to be 6 hours and pain free.<br />My birth was great - and for the most part pain free!  With hypnobirthing you re-frame in your mind what pain is.  My birth was intense, but not painful.  I am 30 years old and this was my first pregnancy.  I felt great right until the end of my pregnancy and slept through the night.  I think the Rainbow Relaxation and Hynobirthing techniques really helped me stay relaxed right up until the delivery and I went a week past my due date.  From the very start to finish my labor and delivery was 9 hours and only about 7 hours if you count from when I was sure I was in labor (so close to my 6 hour prediction).  I labored at home with my husband, got to the hospital at 8:20am and my little girl was born at 9:40am. The only thing the doctor said was I should have came earlier, as I was fully dilated and 100% effaced when I arrived at the hospital.  We live in a smaller town in Montana and I had a great doctor that was willing to let me \\"breathe the baby down\\" and I really only \\"pushed\\" for about 4-5 minutes at the very end and that was less intense than the last hour of labor.  It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life - and it just makes me sad that so many women have such a painful experience with labor. Our bodies grow these babies mostly on their own - they know how to deliver them too - you just need to trust your body. It really can be amazing and pain free!  I suggest trying Hypnobirthing - you will be amazed at what you body can do if you just relax and let it do the work.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|it maybe just me but I get a lot of the same words and its become annoying no longer fun to play :/ it is great on my Kindle but on the smaller devices my friends play on they cant quite draw as clear n they stop playing ;\
B0063IH60K|1.0|Typically between games, Solitaire will advertise another MobilityWare game for sale. I have no problem with that. But one time the commercial started showing people pulling off their clothes, and I could not stop the video. I don't appreciate this kind of stupidity, but not to warn me that the simple game may contain appropriate material is completely unethical. I have kids that play these games, but not anymore. I've deleted the app and won't go near their software again. MobilityWare is SICK.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fun and fast paced game. Easy to learn but hard to master. Highly recommended best chase game ever.
B000I186FW|5.0|When I first saw the title, I thought this movie was about someone avenging someone else. My guess was half right. This unknown man in mask who calls himself, \\"V\\" tried to blow up the Parliament building, as the original Guy Fawkes tried and failed the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Other than this movie taking place in England, the time period of this movie is the near future in 2035. Somehow this movie shows how this world may turn into: People live under censorship and surveillance, the mainstream media is blurred from truth, no one is allowed to criticize their own government, and the protective government became the so called, \\"Big Brothers.\\" I pretty hope that things will not be like this and turn out in better ways. I believe that this movie, to go back to the topic, tried to enlighten the people. This \\"V\\" was trying to open the eyes of people to stop being ignorant and stand up against their corrupt government and watch as V blows up the Parliament building as a symbol of ending their current regime. The lessons of this movie are certainly not to stand up as masked vigilante to blow up the Parliament building. The real lesson would be for people to actually act as people of democracy and stand up for their rights and freedom from those who wants to take them away.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game that's all that's needs to be said. I have been waiting for it to come out on the kindle fire.

B003Y5H574|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this one... Lots of fun to watch and laugh at!  Nice storyline twist that we really didn't see coming, we thought that the entire cast did a great job.
B0077PBPJ6|3.0|Wonderful story but very disappointed in the very private sex scenes in the story.<br />Had I known of the explicit scenes, I would not have purchased this movie.<br />I love trading and passing on movies with my daughter and my granddaughters but this is NOT a movie I would encourage a 16 and an 18 year old watch.<br />I  have felt that I could always trust in PBS to have wholesome and healthy movies for the whole family,  and this is not one of them.
B0086700CM|5.0|the app itself is five stars but the fact that it took so long to get here is disappointing. I am looking forward to other great apps. (jetpack joyride)

B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of my favorite series: speaks to all aspects of relationships, love, trust, respect, fear, communication, honesty.  And, there are many lessons to learn from the reading.  After watching the characters grow and mature, I will surely miss them.

0553386794|5.0|This will largely be my response towards some of the bashing and criticizing of \\"Game of Thrones\\". It took me a while to muster up the courage to begin reading these massive novels: I did not regret it.<br /><br />Many have made the claim that Game of Thrones has a plethora of characters that contribute minimally  to the plot or that there is no end in sight. My response to these claims is that there is no way to know if a seemingly minor character may become a major player in the subsequent novels. It is sometimes from these so-called insignificant characters that we learn more about major players of the game of thrones and Westeros and the people beyond the nobility. Why read a book only to rush to the end? Too often do readers pick up a book only to spend most of their time thinking about what the end will be. Martin has set up where a world filled with hundreds of characters and details that merit interest. It is these things that distinguish Martin and his series.<br /><br />Many criticize the fact that Martin kills off major characters. In my opinion, novels who present superhuman protagonists without flaws are boring. I have read countless novels that seem overly-predictable and that are just offsetting because of one dimensional and suprehuman characters. In the \\"Real World\\" people die, good or bad, and the \\"good guys\\" do not always triumph.  This random killing of characters is what keeps Martin's book fresh and unpredictable and realistic. Do not get repelled byGame of Thrones because someone suggests it does not follow conventional fictional writing.<br /><br />All of these things said, Martin's novels were engrossing. There are characters you will love, you will cheer for, you will never want to stop reading about. There are  also characters that will mistify you, anger you, vex you. There of course are fantasy aspects-dragons, giants, wargs-but these do not detract from the story being told. Some fantasy novels just shower you with dragons and get mundane. Martin presents a world that is full of intruige, betrayal, violence, happiness, sorrow. You would not regret reading this series.ne. Martin presents a world that is full of intruige, betrayal, violence, happiness, sorrow. You would not regret reading this series.

B003V1WTMM|4.0|This book was VERY similar to The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield.  It involves a story of twins, parental secrets, disturbed siblings, a mysterious estate, and a would-be-writer - impacted by the death of her only sibling and troubled relations with her mother -  trying to unravel painful secrets.  Percy Blythe is like Vida Winters, Edith Burchill is like Margaret Lea, etc.
B0086700CM|5.0|Just like on a Ipod or Iphone. Just great love it could play it forever!!! I love!!Very adicting Go temple run
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I just love this game okay! The fist time I got this for free I started to like and got addicted to it! LOL.

0066620996|4.0|Good to Great is a highly regarded and renowned book with millions of copies sold. The book highlights key cultural characteristics of both successful and unsuccessful companies large and small. While the premise of the book is sound and is backed with researched data, many of the points are generalized and are not applicable to all companies.<br /><br /> A key premise of the book is to have the best people working for your company. While this is certainly sound knowledge, I fail to see how this can help propel your company into a fortune 500 company, especially when the book doesn't have any advice on how to hire the right people. It seems like a logical assumption that we would all like to have the right people working for us, however the realities of industry makes this chapter read more like fiction.<br /><br /> That being said, Good to Great is still worth the read. It is written so that it can be easily read by anyone whether you are the CEO of a multimillion dollar corporation, or an up and coming entrepreneur. Simple ideas are compared with real world scenarios to highlight and illustrate the author's key points.
0345803485|5.0|Amazing book. Its always stuck in my head. Dream guy. Amazing sex scenes. More of a college young adult book then older generation due to sex style.  I would highly recommend!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I code not put my kindle my mom hare to take it out of my room.so that is how much I love this game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I see everyone else in my family playing this game.  Competing to get the high score.  I thought that I would never get to have this game.  Thinking it's only for android and tablets.  THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!!  I apsolutely love this game.  Trying to beat MY high score is challenging.  Seeing how far you can get.  And trying to complete the objectives is something else.  Can't wait to get enough coins to try out the other characters.

B007SYWFRM|2.0|Ordered this for grandkids to play. I feel this game has trick buttons within the game that if you hit them you end up ordering extra downloads for the so called \\"free\\" game.  Also, once in the game it never allowed me to get out of it or go back to my home page on the kindle, always had to completely shut off kindle to get out of the game.  My computer savvy sons, one an IT specialist couldn't get out of this game either.  We removed it from our kindle.  Dumb thing!
0345528581|5.0|I've been a habitual New Year's Resolution workout guy for years, and this book is the one that motivated me to stick with it and truly catch the strength training bug. Maybe it's because I can workout at home, because of the 10-week program, or I just got lucky and this year is my year. What really got me is that the workouts require effort, but they're not that hard, and the program allows for steady progress. I highly recommend this book, if nothing else, for the multitude of exercises inside.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed these books. While on vacation I have never seen soooooo many people reading the same books. No joke at my resort of 200 rooms I bet well over 12 of them were reading this series. Plus 2 flight attendants were reading them and then a girl sitting next to me. Everyone seems to be reading them. I know some people thought they werent very good but i really enjoyed them!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I felt compelled to write a quick review of the product because this book is just so very good.  Fantastic characters in a well-developed world in which the author takes no shortcuts.  His writing style reminds me of George R. R. Martin (yes, very high praise) in that every character has a motivation; no one is Eeeeevil just for the sake of being Eeeeevil.  This is a dark story and the protaganist is a long, long way from being your stereotypical HERO - which is a good thing.  It's the most entertaining novel I've read in quite awhile ... I'll be waiting to snap up anything else written by Anthony Ryan.  Especially Book Two.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|lasted three months before it would not pickup signals. I have used alfa-G adapters for years in Aircrack. You are not able to use this for this.

B004G6TCMQ|5.0|Emerson Lake And Palmer  (1970)  #18<br /><br />I've reviewed this album before, but i tell you this is the best sounding remaster they have done.  Very crisp sounding disc.  It sure is nice hearing ELP in great form.  The rest of the remasters through Brain Salad Surgery, are great as well.  Nice 8 page booklets also.  Hopefully this will end the ELP remasters!?, i think they finally got it right.
1609611543|3.0|I got this book because my husband is a complementary medicine specialist that has been preaching the evils of wheat for years. I do not have celiac disease but DO have an ongoing weight challenge, so wanted to see what the \\"renowned\\" Dr. had to say. The history of wheat was interesting, the research to support his claims not so much. It's been my experience that most doctors don't have a good grasp of nutrition as it relates to dis-ease and I can't say this one changed my mind much.<br /><br />One BIG lesson I learned with this book is NEVER, EVER to order directly from Rodale! They charge four times the price for the same book, rarely have research based information and \\"renowned\\" means in practice doing something somewhere. Much the same with thier magazines. Unfortunately, I got snookered.
B007704HO6|5.0|This was a really great insight in to the lives of people you see busking and selling the big issue .... the story of Bob is amazing ...but the story of his \\"owner\\" is inspirational. Don't expect a great piece of literature ....but its an exceptional read!
0307592731|5.0|This book was given to me by a dear friend.  I am currently reading the book and I have to say I have not enjoyed a book this much in a long time ... not since I read \\"Tales of a Female Nomad\\".  Cheryl is such a good writer!  I have a feeling a screen play will be adapted from this book.
B004G6TCIA|5.0|\\"Tarkus\\"  (1971).  A million seller.<br /><br />Been a ELP fan for 35 years now.  This Sony UK remaster is simply wonderful.  I highly recommend these Sony remasters, a step above the Shout Factory remasters in 2007.  I think they finally got it right!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I actually just wanted to see what it was at first,  was curious and got it. Great choice indeed. Works great on the kindle fire and my husband and I are both into this app. It is different and quite frankly addictive too. It is fun,  and am sure when yall try it,  yall will agree too. Of course only thing I do not agree with for the app is the price. It should be lower and if you can vet it as a free app jump on it quickly! [[ASIN:B007JM4CWY CrossMe]]

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I normally don't like to write negative reviews and this one isn't necessarily negative, however I'm unsure how I feel about this book.  It was \\"Ok\\" in my opinion.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone due to the characters in this book were annoying to me.  Ana said \\"Oh crap\\" constantly and always consulted with her subconscious which was also annoying!  I liked some of the erotic moments but even this got repetitive.  I also did not like the ending.

0553386794|5.0|Get enough nobles together and they're bound to start stabbing each other in the back to get closer to the throne. What can go wrong? Not much. A fantastic read.<br /><br />For an epic fantasy series the book takes more from medieval history than it does Tolkien, and although a similar size it thankfully doesn't get as bogged down in narrative description the same way other writers such as Jordan do.<br /><br />The characters are fleshed out, and to their credit most are more shades of grey like real people rather than outright good or evil.<br />Westros feels like it has a real history and culture that goes beyond the page (I would say Jordan's Wheel of Time and Tolkien's LotRs are more creative though, but given both can be too detailed to the point of confusing, I'd say Martin made the right call on not going overboard).<br /><br />I have heard from people I know that the books lose their way in future installments, with too many poorly developed secondary characters coming in to the detriment of the stronger central cast, and multiple story arcs seemingly dropped without trace. A part of this seems to be placed down to the author writing the books years apart and in the midst of other projects, rather that writing it without break.<br /><br />Either way, this book was awesome.

0786915749|5.0|The dragonlance series is one of my favourites when I was a teen - and Chronicles is what made me an avid reader. The characters are interesting and each is different (although they are fantasy archetypes and so most never reach a filly 3d status), Tas offers humour and the trials of other characters offers tragedy and heartbreak. Its relatively short compared to some other fantasies (Wheel or Time and Game of Thrones), and not as difficult to read as say Lord of the Rings - as such its an easy enjoyable read.<br /><br />I do think coming back to them 15 years on they aren't as good as I remember. Many of the characters are rather 2d fantasy archetypes now that I've read other series, and sometime I think there is far to much telling nor showing. For example one character later becomes a General and we are told their soldiers will follow them even to death.... why? What inspired such loyalty. Seriously, one chapter the character is named General and the next has the unquestioning allegiance of an army? Why not develop it? Show the character earning their loyalty through leading them to some amazing victory.<br /><br />Anyway, despite its flaws I still loved it, its a good series and still one of my favourites.<br /><br />If you liked it I would highly recommend [[ASIN:0553286390 Dragon Wing (The Death Gate Cycle, Book 1)]] by the same authors.

0345803485|2.0|I am just not seeing what all the hype is about this book! I have read about 3/4 of it and have decided it is not worth my time. It will go into the rummage sale this month. People have told me that I will like it when I read the ending but I just can't get through the rest of the book so what is the point? Personally without spoiling it too much , I just saw red flags all over of an abusive relationship-sex aside. Every fiber of my being was screaming \\"what would someone want in this? Tell him where to go!\\" Take my advice, if ever you have been in a controlling relationship or parented by a controlling parent-this may give you anxiety!<br />After reading other reviews, I wholeheartedly agree that the writing was bad and if Ana was as \\"wet\\" as she was in the book, people may think she had a bladder problem. The repetition and completely unreal sex (even the \\"vanilla sex\\") were all just too much. I found I needed to force myself to keep reading because everyone said it was so wonderful, the same way I did with Twilight. I have to learn that doing that is a waste of my time!!
B0048WQDIE|4.0|'What catch?'<br /><br />'Catcha twenty-two..'<br /><br />One of the heralded classics of the 20th century and a solid statement about the idiocy of war, Catch-22 has few, if any equals.<br /><br />The only real objection this reviewer has about the Kindle version is that you can obtain the paperback at a cheaper price. My recommendation is to buy the paperback and wait for the eBook price to settle down to a more reasonable level.

B005V1WZ10|1.0|EDIT: I RECENTLY SAW KORN LIVE, June 2013, their guitarist is back, and they are making a new album back to their roots. They did not play a single song from this album. This album is not the Korn I love, they are however going back to that, so they are not \\"dead\\", this album was just a bump in the road. John Davis is still coming strong!!!<br /><br />Gonna make this short to not waste anymore of my time, or your time with this album. If you were ever a Korn fan, do not buy this album, sounds nothing like them except for Jon Davis' voice (which isn't the same as before either in my opinion). Jon Davis recently did a song for the group Infected Mushroom, I think they liked it so much they stole all their electronica ideas and sounds and made an album out of it, ditching the real instruments (drums, guitar, etc). Complete garbage that I could make or anyone for that matter with knowledge on a sound creating software program. Period. If you do like this album, check out Infected Mushroom, sounds similar but wayyy better.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games is an interesting tale of a post-apocalyptic world in which a dictatorship has risen in place of the eastern portion of the United States.  This new country is comprised of 12 districts and a capitol.  Life in the districts is markedly different from life in the Capitol.  The districts serve the capitol and control is maintained by rationing of food and by means of an annual \\"to the death\\" competition in which a male and female competitor from each district is selected by lottery.  The book follows a young woman, Katniss Everdeen, as she tries to survive this brutal competition.<br /><br />This novel is a fun read. It certainly kept my attention.  I originally bought the hardback version and, when I finished it, I had to run out to get book 2 because I really wanted to know what happened next.  I bought the Kindle version because my daughter wanted to read it right then.
0062183591|5.0|\\"The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone - Especially Ourselves\\" by Dan Ariely is a fascinating look at cheating and dishonesty.  Backed by research, Ariely provides explanations for the unethical behavior that seems to be endemic from Washington to Wall Street, the classroom to the workplace, and everywhere else you turn.<br /><br />It is interesting to see that irrational forces are often behind whether we behave ethically or not, and cheating and dishonesty are not merely derived from a cost-benefit analysis.  The more engaging element of this book is Ariely's ability to make his research interesting, engaging, and relevant.  It was not only an educational book, but a very engaging and entertaining one too.  One of the many things I found interesting was the conclusion from an experiment that suggested that the probability of getting caught doesn't have a substantial influence on the amount of cheating.  This is just the opposite that I thought would happen and that I suppose many others would believe too.<br /><br />The book explores why we cheat others and why we cheat ourselves.  One especially interesting part were the findings of how people only cheat \\"a little bit\\" so they can still consider themselves honest and good.  It was also interesting when some experiments showed people would cheat to help others more than themselves, and at other times how certain things such as reminding people about honesty could decrease the amount of cheating.  The opposite is also true, with findings that wearing \\"fakes\\" can lead us to cheat more.  Think having a stronger relationship with a professional will reduce the likelihood of the professional acting for a self-interest when faced with a conflict of interest?  Think again!  The chapter on conflicts of interest and being blinded by our own motivations sheds some interesting light on this topic as well.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and it explained occurrences I've seen in others and myself.  It provided information for me to use when maintaining my own honesty as I try to raise honest children and influence others with ethical behavior.  As the author concludes, once we better understand what really causes our less-than-optimal behavior, we can start to discover ways to control our behavior and improve our outcomes.  Ariely's \\"The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty\\" is definitely a start to better understanding what really causes cheating and dishonesty, and it is a book I recommend highly to anyone interested in this field of study.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of the soon to be released Ben Baker Sniper novel \\"Lost Conscience.\\"and myself.

0307957934|3.0|A timely subject given the current state of the world financial markets. Harris's latest is a gripping read and had me up late turning the pages. There are some very clever ideas here as well as quite a lot of technical explanation as to how markets etc work. A great read... but, but, but I can't see this book staying with me. I'll have forgotten about it in a week, so it feels like a transitory page-turner rather than a classic - hence 3 stars.

B007L96VCY|4.0|After the reasonable success of McCartney [his first post-Beatles solo album], Paul took a bit of a holiday and returned fresh to the studio in November 1970 to begin the Ram sessions. This time the approach would a solidly studio effort, incorporating sesions musicans such as guitarists David Spinozza and Hugh McCracken (actual name). Through early 1971 they recorded 23 songs for the Ram sessions, and the album (pared down to 12 songs) was released the following May.<br /><br />Ram is strongly considered to be one of Paul's best solo efforts (if not THE best), and it's almost impossible to argue that it isn't a huge step forward from his first solo LP. Whereas that album generally consisted of homespun musical doodles, the tracks on Ram are more polished, layered, and fully-formed. The end result is a very strong album with some really memorable work.<br /><br />\\"Too Many People\\" opens the album as if to immediately quell the listener's fear that they'd be listening to \\"McCartney part II\\". It's a slick, midtempo rock number that is one of his best, highlighted by that rich guitar tone on its signature riff (opens the song, played under the chorus). The song contains two digs at Lennon that probably resulted in that infamous Lennon postcard with him recreating Ram's cover... with a pig.<br /><br />\\"3 Legs\\" is Paul doing his White Album blues wankery, and it's a tolerable song but just as easily skippable. A chirpy ukelele strum introduces \\"Ram On\\", a cheerful number that has a wonderful dreamy quality to it. I love the sound of the vocal orchestrations on this track. Paul seems to be having fun by now, and this leads directly into the wondeful \\"Dear Boy\\", the most Beatle-esque sounding track on the album. You could have slipped this into any Beatle project mid 67 through 68 without anyone looking twice.<br /><br />And then.... \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\". I can hear the knives sharpening in anticipation. All I can say is that I *LOVE* this ridiculously silly song. Always have. Have at you.<br /><br />\\"Smile Away\\" wisps away the silliness of the previous song with a loud, swingin' rocker. Linda's backing vocals are beginning to get a bit grating. Gears shift again with \\"Heart of the Country\\", Paul doing his gentle folksy bit, and I like it. Say what you want about McCartney being \\"lightweight\\", but he was easily the most versatile of The Beatles, both as a songwriter and a musician.<br /><br />There's only one song I actively dislike on Ram, and that's \\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\". Linda's vocals get REALLY grating here; it's not so much that she can't sing, but more like because her vocals simply don't fit. Anywhere. The over-emoting in Paul's vocal delivery doesn't help either. The sad thing is, with a couple of fixes this song could have gone from annoying to good. I like the chorus for the most part, the production sounds fine, and with a different approach (taking away the echoey repeats at the end of each line in the verses, removing Linda's vocals, Paul singing it straightforward rather than in a melodramatic manner) it could have been a MUCH better song. As it stands... it annoys me.<br /><br />Things improve much with \\"Eat At Home\\", a cheeky upbeat rocker about afternoon delights. It has a country twang to it that really works. The only thing I could do without is the \\"hoo-hoo-hooooo\\" during the bridge, but overall this is a sweet tune and one of my favorites on the album. The rollicking beat really makes this song work.<br /><br />Linda gets pushed to the forefront ENTIRELY too much with \\"Long Haired Lady\\". Her droning delivery during the opening verse is nails on a chalkboard. Again, not so much that she can't sing -- she can't, at least, not professionally -- it's more like she SHOULDN'T. Average, at best. Once she gets shoved out of the way, the song isn't bad. Definite filler material.<br /><br />To end the album we start with a 1 minute reprise of \\"Ram On\\" which, OK, doesn't really count for much of anything. Finally we have \\"The Back Seat Of My Car\\", a dark, piano laden ballad that rises to a strong, powerful crescendo. Paul's vocals sound strong and confident here, I like the feel of the song; it has that sort of \\"written in movements\\" feel of \\"Band of the Run\\" or \\"Admiral Halsey\\". It's a great track but it just feels incomplete at the end to me, for some reason.<br /><br />Recorded during the Ram sessions but NOT included on the original album were \\"Another Day\\" and \\"Oh Woman Oh Why\\". These songs were released as a single, the former the A-side and a big Top 10 hit for McCartney, and has the distinction of being his first solo single released after the Beatles breakup. It's a great tune as well, a contemporary urban take on \\"Eleanor Rigby\\". Also just as good is \\"Oh Woman Oh Why\\", a rocker with a killer groove and strong bluesy vocals from Paul. Both tracks, if included on Ram, would have made a really good album even better!<br /><br />Overall, I really like Ram. It has some great songs, a few filler tracks, and only one number I actively dislike. Although it was derided upon its release, over time rock critics have recognized that McCartney was forging ahead with his own sound and produced a strong album. He successfully raised his game from his quizzical first album in terms of production and songwriting, although to be honest there's nothing on Ram that even comes close to the phenomenal \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\"; however, this speaks less about Ram's songs as it demonstrates how much of an anomaly MIA was compared to the rest of \\"McCartney\\".ly we have \\"The Back Seat Of My Car\\", a dark, piano laden ballad that rises to a strong, powerful crescendo.

1451648537|5.0|This is a very candid biography especially for an authorised one. Obviously rushed out after Jobs's death he emerges as a complex person: a visionary but not a pleasant man to work with, 'a world class a**hole' as the book describes him. No matter how good Apple's products are the fact that he was willing to turn over old friends and business colleagues left the impression of a man I couldn't entirely like. The book is a real page-turner, though the chapter titles, with quotes from Shakespeare and The Beatles, are a bit pretentious.
B00003CXBK|1.0|How in the world did this get into Roger Ebert's top?! This movie made no sense, it was completly boring, and it was just too violent. Really, you lovers have no taste. If that director could've put an actual story in it, make it cool, and use less gore... heck, I would've loved it! Eh, but it never caught my attention... \\"Castle in the Sky\\" caught my attention. So here's good advice: Don't show it to anyone under 17; wait; don't watch it at all... unless you need something to put you to bed.

0307949486|4.0|Best of the trilogy and the only real stand alone book. There's a terrible information dump at the beginning and often the writing is rather clich&eacute;d (though this might be the translation). Once it gets going though, it's gripping to the end with plenty of twists and some great characters, people you end up really warming to and/or hating. It's also evocative of Sweden in the winter. However, I was left baffled as to why Blomkvist is such a ladies man!<br /><br />The Millennium Trilogy has become a phenomenon and if you're the slightest bit interested in popular culture you have to read them - but I suggest you can get away with this first book and blag your way on the rest.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Now NOBODY has to be dumb or completly brainless to know that this is the best movie yet! It's just weird and cool seeing the Avengers all together. So the plot may be a wee bit off, but other than that; the assamble is good, the action is good, and the movie itself is AWESOME. Oh, here's a heads up: Any of you readers liked the battle sequences of \\"Dark of the Moon?\\" Well step right up, the begining end of \\"The Avengers\\" is almost EXACTLY like that battle. So this is \\"The Avengers,\\" slick, cool, action packed, and clearly the best movie ever!
0767836324|2.0|`Hook' was one of those movies that I loved as a child.  I think that that really is the point here.  As a child, it is hard to find the flaws because you are just watching something that is entertaining.  There are pirates and there is Peter Pan (who is beloved by all children) and there is fantasy and danger and there's that whole moving bit about family togetherness and, well, when you are under the age of ten this movie is just about perfect.<br /><br />Try watching it at thirty.<br /><br />Honestly, this movie is far too aware of the message it is trying to convey and so it does it in such a straightforward and glaringly obvious manner that it feels devoid of any real feeling.  DON'T FORGET YOUR YOUTH PETER!  DON'T BE MEAN TO YOUR KIDS PETER!  DON'T BE SO SERIOUS PETER!  I mean, it doesn't know the word `subtle' and so it never institutes it, not once.  That wouldn't be so bad if the remainder of the film wasn't a giant clich&eacute; in itself.  From Peter's home life to his children's daddy issues to the stereotypical and lazy way the Lost Boys are utterly DESTROYED here (UGH, what have you DONE Steven?  Why do most of the Lost Boys come across mildly retarded?) is just almost heartbreaking.  I think another mistake on the part of the film is making Peter appear to be a complete villain in the film's outset, even when his kids are legitimately being annoying as all get out (especially his son).  I mean, if I were that boy's father I probably would have smacked him on the plane.  Like, I understand that he's a workaholic and too serious and wound up or whatever, but they could have tried to balance that more.  Thus the `in your face' complaint I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />Seriously, Peter Pan is like one of my favorite childhood memories, but watching `Hook' in my adulthood has tarnished that blessed memory for me.<br /><br />Robin Williams is out of his comfort zone here.  He tries to be Robin Williams, which doesn't work with this character.  Julia Roberts is cutesy as always, basically playing Julia Roberts, and she manages to create a stirring image of fun or whatever but she never really lands the heart of Tink (even when she tries).  Dante Basco is horrible, but the whole idea of Rufio is a total failure in itself.  Whoever came up with that should have been punched in the face.  Maggie Smith is SUBLIME, and Dustin Hoffman all but saves this movie from being completely horrid thanks to his charismatic take on Captain Hook.<br /><br />The film is pretty, the sets are great and the visuals are intriguing, but overall this grown up fairytale is a mess.<br /><br />On another note, Amber Scott, the young actress who plays Peter's daughter Maggie, has grown up to be a total knockout.  Like, OH MY GOD...just check out her IMDB page!tesy as always, basically playing Julia Roberts, and she manages to create a stirring image of fun or whatever but she never really lands the heart of Tink (even when she tries).

0307454568|3.0|Personally I thought this was better than the second book (which dragged in places) and it neatly ties up lots of loose ends. However, it's riven with daft implausibilities (maybe they do things differently in Sweden but since they've just tried to kill each other would they really put Lisbeth and her father in the same hospital, along the same corridor with no guards?!); it's also a bit flabby and once again every women falls for Mikael. But the trial scene is brilliant and you'll feel a warm glow when you turn the last page.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I stand by title. About 60% of \\"The Hunger Games\\" is dialogue or silent action... except for the shreik in the beginning. Anyway, the movie is perfectly paced and is super violent... no, really! DO NOT SHOW THIS TO ANYONE UNDER 7! Still, all the troubles Katniss goes through will really pump your heart; Peeta however has a really boring story. To recap, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a thrilling film that slightly relates to \\"The Grey,\\" but WAY better! So get ready to feel the Hunger!!!
B000A88EV4|3.0|Mike Leigh is that type of director who seems to love his characters.  He loves to allow the audience to come to know them from afar almost, building delicately as the actors flesh out the intricacies that most directors may overlook.  There is an effortless flow to most of his works (at least the ones that I have seen) that you can't help but respect the approach that Leigh takes to creating an easy naturalistic atmosphere.<br /><br />`Naked' almost feels like it was directed by a different personal altogether.<br /><br />There is an awareness that is too present in `Naked', a self-awareness that hurts the film's impact.  It is far too aware of the impact that it is trying to make, so it becomes somewhat self-indulgent and off-putting.  Maybe that was the point, but it also plays against the film as a whole.  It doesn't help that there isn't much of a connective story here, just some random conversations over the course of a night out for a rapist fleeing a vengeful family.  I'm not against films that feature no actual arcs but focus heavily on character development, but sadly the central character isn't interesting enough to validate this approach.  The supporting characters are all far more intriguing and actually develop more insightful and poignant looks at the human psyche.<br /><br />Many have toted David Thewlis's performance as one of the best of the year that was 1993, some even saying it is one of the best performances put to film.  I give that a bit of a shrug.  It is far too `on the nose'.  That's not to say that it isn't interesting from a certain angle, but overall it doesn't leave one with the intended impact.  Peter Wight and Lesley Sharp are far more ingrained in their characters and thus leave the viewer with a more impactful feeling.  Sharp especially glues this film together, for it is her at times silent observations that cement the film in some sort of emotional focal point.<br /><br />The whole concept of Ewen Bremner's character, Archie, is a major downfall for the film for it tries to give the story an arc and fails to feel connected to the rest of the film.  It serves as a yin and yang for Johnny (Thewlis's character) but not in a cohesive way.  Johnny is a rapist, but mentally haphazard and arguably harmless (or at least he is painted this way), while Archie is a cruel and demented psychopath.  It doesn't add anything to the film and actually takes away from the heart of the film because it cheapens it.<br /><br />Not to mention, Bremner's performance is gross.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I see why some appreciate this film, but I can't fathom why anyone would laud it.  It doesn't know how to balance out its parts and so it comes off unfocused and somewhat forgettable.a major downfall for the film for it tries to give the story an arc and fails to feel connected to the rest of the film.

0345803485|1.0|I have never written a review for a book, but felt I should for this one.  With all the hype, I bought it to read on vacation.  I have so many problems with this book.<br /><br />1.  It makes women look so stupid....golly gee, gosh, oh my!<br />2.  The writing was so bad, I was laughing.<br />3.  The wording was laughable...\\"he cupped her sex\\"...LOL<br />4.  I hate the stereotypical..he's a great looking billionaire who buys her cars, and flies her around in helicopters...golly gee...what a guy! I'm just a dumb girl.<br />5.  I hate that she was a virgin and how quickly she was ok with being spanked and could orgasm on command.<br />6.  The main character was so annoying, it was hard to read.<br />7.  The worst of all is that he asked her to sign a contract because he was a FREAK, and she actually has to consider it...\\"golly gee, I'm a virgin...would I be ok with nipple clamps and anal fisting?...I'll have to think about that\\".<br />8.  She agrees to the contract and then leaves him at the end of book 1...want to to guess why?  Cuz he is a freak and beats her ass with a belt....AFTER she says it's ok for him to do so!  ARGHHH...<br /><br />I will not be reading books 2 or 3.  It kind of upsets me that the author will make MILLIONS on this crappy book and there are really good struggling authors out there who can actually write.<br /><br />Can anyone recommend a book with a STRONG female character who doesn't make me cringe for all women-kind like this one did?<br /><br />I'm 50 shades of disgusted with this book!
0439023513|2.0|As I read this book, I kept hoping that Katniss would find some good in humanity, but it didn't happen.  For all but the last ten pages of the book, the reader is assaulted with how awful the Capitol is, and how awful Coin and the rebels are.  Both sides want power, and they will stop at absolutely nothing to get it and keep it, including killing children and framing the other side for the atrocity.  Even her friends, Gale and Peeta, have been corrupted.  Gale struggles with a utilitarian approach - killing some people for the greater good is acceptable.  Meanwhile, Peeta's torture at the hands of President Snow has left him half insane due to his twisted memories.<br /><br />Katniss is completely lost in this book.  She spends most of her time in a drug-induced stupor hiding in cabinets.  And I don't blame her.  She has realized that both sides in this fight are monstrous.  Even in the end of the book, when she is back in District 12 and trying to continue living, she is only surviving.  There is no living after what she went through, what she discovered.  It is from Plutarch that we hear the truth behind the story.  The people in that world are terrible to one another, and it will only be a matter of time before the cycle of destruction begins again.<br /><br />The one thing that really bothered me in this book was Prim's death, but now that I think about it, Prim's death makes sense in the world Suzanne Collins has created.  Prim, with her hopes of becoming a doctor, symbolized hope for a brighter, more sympathetic future.  Killing her was Collins's way of showing the reader that there isn't really any hope.  People will go on living, and someday they will go back to killing as well.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Remarkable book. Suzanne Collins has put together an imaginative and chilling story set in a future America. Its young protagonists and their love story give a note of hope. The book is brilliantly structured, the characters believable, the story satisfying if disturbing. Fine, fine book.

B007N0REX6|3.0|I bought this CD hoping that it would rock. It kinda did, but left me flat. Slash is basically doing his thing as if on autopilot, and as some of the other reviews suggested, Mr. Kennedy really DOES sound the same on every track. I really like Slash a great deal, and do appreciate his consistency, but was hoping that he wouldn't sound like a rehashed version of himself from 20 years ago. I guess I expect my favorite artists to grow musically. Slash hasn't which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but won't bring me back to hear more.

0345803485|1.0|Made the mistake of downloading this onto my Kindle.  Saw it was top of the charts and bought it without knowing anything else.  It is truly unreadable.  Granted, I was a little shocked, once I figured  out what it was about. But I pushed on, thinking it must develop into something intriguing. It never does; it's just plain awful.  Horrifically bad writing, no real plot line.  As a woman, I'm embarrassed that this is what so many females consider a good book. I thought Danielle Steele was bad - this is beyond terrible. I'm not being a prude - if this was a well-written, well-developed novel, I wouldn't mind the subject matter. But it's complete junk; stunned this terrible book is making an awful writer a ton of money.

0439023513|3.0|Katniss takes to her new position as a rebel in District 13. She and a few others were saved from the Quarter Quell but Peeta wasn't saved and the Capitol has him. Katniss is still fears President Snow. After much thought, she decides to be the Mockingjay, for the rebel side. In return, she gets freedom for her friends and permission to kill Snow. Another Games victor, Beetee, makes Katniss a special weapon.<br /><br />Katniss has to film commercials for the rebel side, called propos. For one propo, she and a team that includes her old friend Gale are sent into District 2, where they see a hospital get destroyed. This inspires Katniss to call for justice. Because the rebels are gaining in strength, and because Peeta has sent out a coded message to the rebels warning them of an attack, the Capitol releases footage of Peeta being tortured.<br /><br />Katniss is horrified by the way Peeta is being treated. The Capitol bombed District 13, just as Peeta said it would. Citizens of District 13 retreated underground for several days. When it was all clear, Katniss made another propo, while the rebel teams went to go rescue Peeta.<br />The rebels got Peeta and some other folks out of the Capitol, but Peeta's been badly hurt. He's been \\"hijacked\\" (as in, brainwashed) and now thinks of Katniss as the enemy. As soon as he sees her, he tries to kill her.<br /><br />Once she recovers from Peeta's attack, Katniss needs to be part of the action. She heads back to District 2 and is part of a summit about whether to attack the other side humanely or inhumanely. Gale suggests some inhumane kinds of weapons and strategies. During the battle that follows, Katniss gets shot. While recovering, she bonds with another victor, Johanna, and witnesses the wedding of victors Finnick and Annie.<br />After a second recovery, Katniss trains to be part of the fighting again. She, Gale, and Finnick are assigned to a special unit that will be filmed during combat and turned into more propos. Right before they go out into the field, Peeta's assigned to their unit too.<br /><br />Katniss is afraid for her life. Though Peeta has improved a bit, he's still hijacked and hates Katniss. Her commander, Boggs, agrees that she should watch out. Boggs is one of the first casualties. Before he dies, he gives Katniss command of their unit.<br />Katniss tells the others she has a secret mission to kill President Snow, and they follow her on what turns out to be a suicide mission. One by one, their team members are sacrificed as they make their way to the heart of the Capitol. Only five of them, including Katniss, Gale, and Peeta, are left by the time they reach it. Then they get separated.<br /><br />During the battle, many innocent children die. Members of the rebels' medical team, including Prim, Katniss's sister, are also killed. Katniss is badly wounded again. On the positive side, the rebels have gained control and have captured President Snow. Katniss visits the imprisoned President Snow, who says she should blame President Coin  for the attack and Prim's death.<br />And maybe he's right. It appears the rebels staged the final attack, and the weapon Gale made  could have been the one that killed Katniss's sister. Katniss couldn't forgive him.<br /><br />In a meeting right before Snow's execution, President Coin says that the remaining Hunger Games victors must vote to determine whether or not the new rebel government should start up the Hunger Games again, as a way to punish the citizens of the Capitol for what they did to the citizens of the Districts. Katniss votes in favor. In part because of Katniss's vote, the answer is yes - the Hunger Games will start again.<br />Then it's time for Snow's execution. Katniss has the task of shooting him with her famous bow and arrow, but at the last minute, she kills Coin instead. Snow dies anyway.<br /><br />At this point, Katniss has a serious breakdown. Time passes, but she's pretty much in a fog. Later she learns that she wasacquitted during her trial, and she's sent back to the ruined District 12, along with Haymitch and later Peeta. Gale disappears into another district.<br />Over time, Katniss is able to grieve for her sister and the many others who died. As she begins to rebuild her life, she and Peeta restore a romantic relationship and eventually have children.
B00846REIS|5.0|Ok, so its really not fair to compare this book to Fifty Shades but I buy it after reading reviews that compared the two.  This book was different in a lot of ways but just as good.  It was emotional and wrenching at times given the issues that both characters are<br />working through and their need to be together.  Like Fifty Shades  it will be in at least two parts.  Sylvia Day is a wonderful writer and I look forward to the next book and any future contemporaries from her!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not my typical read but, with all the hype, I figured I would give this a whirl. I also don't tend to write reviews but, I am hoping to spare someone from purchasing all three of these at once- as I almost did. I have only gotten through about 30% of this &#34;novel&#34; and my inner goddess is mid vomit on her Converse shoes. A key ingredient to any story is making your reader connect with and care about the characters NOT hope they all are killed off in a fiery inferno in the first couple of chapters, which was the case here. E L James should also not write about college girls or attractive 20 something year old men when she is clearly CLUELESS. Presented to the readers is a lead &#34;heroine&#34; about to graduate college that hasn't ever gotten drunk before, is still a virgin, is clearly a self conscious geek, and refers to her vagina as &#34;down there.&#34; Now we, as the readers, are supposed to believe that she is going to make a 27 year old, hot, billionnaire playboy swoon? Really...? The writing is amateurish (&#34;Holy crap&#34;), repetitive (&#34;Oh my&#34;) and just plain ridiculous (&#34;How did all that fit in down there&#34;?!?). As far as I am concerned Christian is not the predator here, it's E L James preying upon under used libidos and insulting the reader's intelligence with poor writing, lame characters, and some regimented, ultimately unoriginal sex scenes.

B002RKSZKI|5.0|I love it! I have never read Jane Austen before so having it for free is just so convenient! I highly recommend this book. The quality in my kindle is also really good.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is just fun. it is easy enough for my 6 year old to play and enjoy but still enjoyable for his father.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is very addicting.  I found myself playing this non stop for a week streight. I found that it started haunting my dreams.
B000JIHP88|5.0|A great mobile. Colorful and with four nice melodies that don't grate on your nerves like some other products do! My baby loves this mobile and loved watching it go round from birth on. She's 8 months old now and still loves it! A great product at a great price. Also consumes less battery than i had thought it would.
0345803507|5.0|Each book got better then the previous. The grammar in the first book got on my nerves. But, it was still a great story and got me hooked. I loved the second book more, and I loved the third book even more then the second! The story was still great, and the ending was perfect! I loved how the author then went back to Christine's past when he was child. Also, it went back to when he and Anna first met, but from his point of view. I also loved how she jumped ahead a few years to give you a peek at their future and also answered some more questions for the reader. Fabulous!!! I can't wait for the next, and hopefully the movie!!!

0345803485|1.0|Ugh, my book club selected this book to read for the month of June.  The last time we selected a trilogy (\\"The Hunger Games\\") I only purchased the first book and then had to buy the other two right away because I loved them so much. So, this time I ordered the entire triology before I even read the first book... BIG MISTAKE.  Now I just finished the first book after painfully willing myself to get through it.  It really is bad.  The writing, the ridiculousness of the plot, everything all the other negative reviews have pointed out make this book a mind-numbing and annoying experience.  I only finished it because I feel guilty when I don't finish my book club books...  What a waste.  I am an educated smart woman and my \\"inner goddess\\" says two thumbs way down for<br />\\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\".

B000JQU1VS|4.0|Very good short stories that can you can read in a little time. That makes each storie a little book in there own, good stories.
B003L77G2Y|3.0|An action movie of a special investigation unit is more and more shifted into New York traditionally, leaving the Fringe headquarters in Boston for, perhaps, merely highlighting a mental link with and a lead of Harvard uni.<br /><br />A story more and more plunges in a mix of characters' personal affairs and pure fantasies to which Christian faith references add much more confusion as absurdity had been screened: a hostile parallel same-souls-inhabited world is a good twist for merely deploying a more popular cast team unable, probably, on a regular basis for shooting a \\"this world\\" story-line.<br /><br />Harvard professor Walter, in and out of a penal system-either a mental institution or a mere prison, exhibiting his boundless knowledge and hands-on expertise in everything is a more and more annoying character, and a next season ought to probably clarify an illogical mess and obvious mismatches found prior to a sit-com future-set release.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the best series I have ever read and I hope the author continues to carry on with it!! Very exciting!!!
B007KOYEOC|2.0|A strong sense of deja vu emanates, this is too much like the Twilight series. It is too neatly resolved, too happy, and inconsistent with the first two books. Quite disappointed.

B00729Z6R4|5.0|If you are a fan of 80's rock,or just good rock music in general,you will be hard pressed to find a more worthy addition to your music collection than the latest offering from these guys.The release starts off with  a bang and you recognize instantly that these guys have \\"it\\". Each song is quality material throughout,while \\"the one and only\\" is worthy of song of the year mention,as least as far as ballads go.No need to run thru every track,just get the cd,you'll be glad you did.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|My son in law shared this app with me and I love it. I already had downloaded five different Bibles on my Kindle but with this app I only needed one on my Fire. I love the audio that goes along with the written word.  I am using the read the Bible through (it has several different ways to do this) in one year. I would have rated this five stars, except that on the Fire I can not get the parallel part to work. I have recommended this app to four different people at work and I have not done that before.
B00479SVBU|5.0|UPDATE REVIEW:<br />I recieved a call back from Satechi within 24 hours and was walked through steps to remedy the problem which was my misunderstanding of what the device was telling me.  The gentleman even helped me look up the radio station that receives the best reception in my area and we are enjoying our tunes once again.  SO THANKFUL this ended up being an easy fix and would buy again.<br /><br />INITIAL REVIEW:<br />I have tried to get this product to work with my ipod and a zune, and it will not recognize either device.  Plugged both in with the cord provided and tried another cord to see if that was the problem....No Luck.  Have contacted the company and left a message about getting a replacement.  Will update based on my experience with their customer service department.  Hope this is just a fluke and that it will be easy to remedy.

0785152458|5.0|What makes Kick-Ass 2 work as well is the first one, is that it doesn't copy the ideas or concepts of the first, it simply builds on them. Even though we have a fresh take on the series here, the original is still heard and felt in the sense that the story revolves around the fallout of the first film. Red Mist deals with his own betrayal of Kick-Ass and co. along with the death of his father by taking drugs and traveling the world for the purpose of making his own team of villains. However, even with that aspect of our story brewing, everything seems to be as good as it's going to get in the world of Dave. He's joined his own superhero team and is actually showing some promise as a fighter, mostly in part to Mindy (hit girl) training him on the side. However soon after a few successful missions of the team, \\"Justice Forever\\" all hell breaks loose and our hero learns the price of doing the right thing in a structured society, in which masked heroes are frowned upon as badly as their deviant counterparts.<br /><br />Kick-Ass 2 continues the series trend of high amounts of violence, detailed artwork showing of gruesome scene all the while coming across as extremely human. Dave created the Kick-Ass figure as a way of dealing with his loneliness, isolation and general high regard of doing the right thing. Yet ironically so, we find him losing everything he has in his life because of something he created out of feeling alone. All the while Red Mist (the motherf...er) seems to want to destroy it with the greatest of ease. Underneath the violence, sexual innuendos and foul language is a great story not just of right and wrong but of somebody trying to do the right thing when everything is against him and all the wrong around him is breathing down his neck ready to rip his throat out. Kick-Ass never let his lack of talent in fighting, talking to women or general bad luck get in the way of fighting for the greater good and that is what makes this series one of the best of all time.l time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so much fun and easy to play. I recommend this game to anyone who loves the ice age movies.
B0086700CM|4.0|This was a very good game but it took like 50 tries to get it download. That is the only fault.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a little.confusing.the games cost way to much.coins. also I think that there should be an actual cooking game that's all but in conclusion j like the game I would love it if there were a cooking game though
B0086700CM|5.0|best games in the world! I love it how you ate Bering chased bye monkey things. but I think they make you fail
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really like the snooze function on this app and the way it makes you wake up by giving you math problems.  I admit it, I'm a geek, but I still like it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have read all three hunger games books and they were all exciting. The stories are something to think about and really make you wonder if this could ever be.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is such a great game!!! I LOVE IT!! My only complaint is that it stalls a little sometimes on my kindle fire. Other than that, GREAT!(:
B005JZBPHS|5.0|The L Word is an amazing series it gave me an insight of a different way of thinking and tot me that Love has more than one meaning and has helped many people Love the lives of these women and the mistakes they make how they love how they get a long with one another just a great show
B005ZUR724|5.0|Worth it! I know it costs a lot but it is the most advanced MMOG for android, kindles, and nooks! (Massive Multiplayer Onlinear Game)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|0.5 stars for nice tie displayed on the cover<br /><br />This is my first and probably last attempt at erotica or romance.<br />I cannot bring myself to believe there are 3 books like this out there...<br />I tried to finish the first one but I just couldn't mock my own intelligence for that much longer.<br /><br />The writing is beyond sterile and repetitive it seems as though the author put her name on something her computer wrote by itself.<br /><br />The characters are unbelievable and you find yourself skipping over the main character's (Ana) life to get to the sex scenes. Once you get to the sex scenes, you can't even enjoy them because her writing distracts you from whatever ounce of sexy those scenes would otherwise have.<br /><br />Even for what would seem like a teenager's fantasy, it is very badly written.<br /><br />I would give the book away but I don't want it ending up wasting someone else's time so I recycled it...the only time I have ever actually recycled a book.<br /><br />Do not buy or illegally download or leave anywhere within 10 meters of your daughters or sons. Trust me, you rather they believe in vampires and warewolves than signing sexual deviance contracts.
B000FCKBCU|1.0|I could tell by the title, and just reading a few pages confirmed, that this book was pretty &#34;fluffy.&#34; However as I progressed I found that the premise is more than just fluffy it's completely ridiculous and insulting. By the time I got 80% thru the book (Kindle edition), I couldn't bring myself to read one more word. Just horrible!
B007JM4CWY|3.0|the game is fun but it has problems opening. I have to try several times each time I want to play to get the app to open
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|\\"Calculator Plus\\" takes full advantage of the Kindle Fire's large screen to present a very basic, but perfectly functional desktop style calculator. I have several calculator apps on my Kindle Fire since my kids like to use it for their homework, but those tend to be much more complicated scientific function applications. This app only provides the basic (+), (-), (*), (/), and (%), along with a handy backspace key. I also like that it displays all of the entries as you go, which is helpful to keep track of list items.<br /><br />The interface is intuitive and as basic as it gets with large friendly buttons and a clear, easy to read display. It is ad supported, but they are very unobtrusive and just about impossible to accidentally hit while using the calculator functions.<br /><br />This is a good free app that works exactly as it should!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I needed a smaller keyboard due to a downsized desk, coming from a logitech G11 keyboard used for gaming lol. This works perfectly for playing my MMO's with my mouse next to it and i have the keyboard off to the side since i rarely need in game chat. Ventrilo works well with this and even has an app that will work with it so you can see the rooms or whos talking at the moment, as well as ping and admin options if you are a vent admin. The key presses are nice and fit my hands well, though you will need to set up your key layout yourself if you want to truly enjoy it. it will take some time but dont bother with the preloads as they may not be placed where you find them useful and youll just get frustrated.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The third book in this trilogy managed to be worse than the second book, I really didn't think it was possible.  The first book was okay and the ending left the reader hanging, so I was compelled to read on.  It took me 3 weeks to trudge through book two, how much sex can you have? Really?  There was very little actual plot, mostly now Christian and Ana will have sex over and over again until you find yourself skimming over paragraphs.  The end of book two finally started to get a little interesting, so again, I tried to move on to the last book.  After 50 pages and a full week trying to struggle to force myself to read the tedious day to day life of Christian and Ana, oh yeah...having sex, I simply had to give up on this trilogy.  These books have no doubt been written by a new and unseasoned author, who felt it was necessary to force 3 books out of what could have easily been one successful novel.  She clearly wants to just describe sexual acts and nothing else.  The low self esteem of Ana and the constant references to her \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"self conscious\\" were beyond annoying and exhausting to read.  I love a good romance, but EL James has managed to ruin the romance novel for me for a long long time.  I never want to read about another sexual encounter again in my life.  Save yourself the time and money and don't bother to read these books.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|thought this would be a great watch since the reviews online were between 4-5 stars. but unfortunately,it didn't deliver for me. the movie plot is like watching \\"Alive\\" meets \\"White Fang\\".
B004EPZ03O|5.0|Recalls all the fun we used to have watching The Muppet Show!  Lots of fun and quite nostagic to see all our favorite characters!  I loved it.
B00004R99F|5.0|The movie is about Max, Goofy's son, who has a crush on a girl and invites her to a party to watch a big radio star perform live. He's thrown for a loop though when his Dad announces they are going on a vacation for bonding. Max fibs to the crush, telling her he's going to be at the rock concert and that he'll join them onstage at the end. Then it's up to him to figure out how to get to CA instead of Lake Destiny for fishing.<br /><br />I have watched this movie with my nephew a hundred times and I still laugh at Big Foot dancing to the song Staying Alive. The songs are engaging and even as an adult I find myself enjoying them. The movie itself is witty, funny and teaches kids that honesty is the best policy and it's ok to love your weird family. It's easy to relate with Max, as a love struck teenager, and with Goofy, who just wants his son to be successful and law abiding.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie enough. It's not as popular as other Disney movies but it should be!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the game, but it is so addictive. once you piack it up you never stop. I love the game. I think everyone should get it.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|Like so many others, I was not a Pink fan, but I caught this concert on Paladia one night and become one real fast.  My husband purchased the video for me as a birthday gift.  Best gift he has ever given me.  Having seen most of the \\"big name\\" concerts in the past twenty years, this one is the best of them all.  She stands alone when it comes to her contemporaries. No one else could have or would have even attempted to do this concert. Even those with great voices, Aquillera, Mariah, Britney, Celine and even Beyonce couldn't handle all that is packed into this 2 hour video.  This is the concert that all other should be judged by.  Just as a point of fact, I saw the Celine Dion Vegas show and although her voice was magnificent, the show itself was boring and very slow at times.  The Funhouse Tour concert will have you at the edge of your seat for the entire time.  Buy it, you will not be sorry.

B007ZKY7XO|3.0|The Scissor Sisters release their fourth album [[ASIN:B007ZKY7XO Magic Hour [Deluxe Edition]]] making some overt overtures to modern pop music and hearkening less to influence Elton John.  The results are different from previous affair [[ASIN:B003LXM1RS Night Work]] as the group invites the likes of John Legend, Azelia Banks, and Pharrell Williams to collaborate (Banks guests as a performer).  Overall, the front portion of Magic Hour is fresh enough with memorable, enjoyable moments, thought the second half suffers and ultimately hurts the totality of the effort.<br /><br />Magic Hour's best song arrives at the `top of the hour' through the John Stephens (aka John Legend) co-write \\"Baby Come Home.\\" Laden with soulful influence much like Legend would sing, the cut ends up being a perfect match for Shear's cutting lead vocals.  The production lends less to electronic textures and hearkens back to the Sisters' first album with it's piano driven sound.  The background vocals are a selling point for sure. Scissor Sisters contrast \\"Baby Come Home\\" with another sound standout via \\"Keep Your Shoes,\\" which features an overt electronic sound.  The gimmicky, `tongue-in-cheek' approach finds Shears at his best, aided further by its repetitive lyrics: \\"...Don't stop `til the early morning...keep your shoes on...\\"<br /><br />\\"Inevitable\\" once again provides a contrast and brings in the ubiquitous Pharrell Williams, who recently added a lift to cuts on Adam Lambert's [[ASIN:B006MVJ2L4 Trespassing (Deluxe)]].  The production is tamed-down a bit for Pharrell, but that is positive for both the band and Williams. The results yielded are the sounds of a classic Bee Gees song, which might be one of the comparisons people could make about the pop group.  Shears goes into his falsetto on the refrain while maintaining his chest voice during the verse.  That contrast in itself bodes well in the soundness of this cut, not to mention another catchy refrain: \\"This is inevitable...it's inevitable that we'll eventually see...\\"<br /><br />First single \\"Only the Horses\\" sounds more like archetypical pop of 2012, but with a bit of a more restrained sound that suits Scissor Sisters better.  The four-on-the-floor beat is inescapable and predictable, but this cut ultimately does give Scissor Sisters more of a `commercial' look within the United States; they are far more popular in England.  Produced by Scissor Sisters and mainstay producer Alex Ridha, \\"We Found Love\\" producer Calvin Harris co-produces.  \\"Year of Living Dangerously\\" may be the first cut with slightly less `fire' than previous cuts.  The songwriting on the verses is not the most `catchy' or captivating, which hurts this cut's lot and memorability.  A bridge section, laden with Shears's falsetto does atone.<br /><br />Speaking of atonement, the kinky, creative \\"Let's Have A Kiki\\" is pretty fun, featuring a percussive-driven groove that recalls Madonna's \\"Vogue\\" - always good.  Much of the beginning of the cut is based on an extended, sensually derived spoken word message, with `answering machine' vocal production.  Quirky, there is something `rewarding' about \\"Let's Have a Kiki.\\" \\"Shady Love\\" brings in up-and-coming rapper Azelia Banks.  The cut is one big `epic,' finding Shears again embracing a `tongue-in-cheek' approach mixed with some edge. The edginess of \\"Shady Love\\" makes it one of the efforts last truly notable cuts.<br />\\"San Luis Obispo\\" changes pace, but feels too casual.  It's tropical influence does not do much for the cut and it is a clear letdown following the slinkiness of \\"Shady Love.\\" Sure, Shears sounds fine, but there is something clearly missing.  \\"Self Control\\" is better, again finding influence from Madonna in regards to groove and production.  The brief length aids \\"Self Control,\\" even though the cut still falls short of the earlier standard of Magic Hour.  \\"Best in Me\\" and \\"The Secret Life of Letters\\" are ok, but still fail to achieve `superbness.' \\"The Secret Life o Letters\\" does contrast with a six-eight feel and more of a ballad-driven approach.  \\"Somewhere\\" closes the standard version with a driven groove, though brings nothing new to the table.<br /><br />The deluxe version includes four additional tracks.  \\"Ms. Matronic's Magic Message\\" serves as a short interlude and introduction to the bonus cuts (no harm, no foul).  \\"F*** Yeah\\" is incredibly manic, finding Shears rapping, incredibly risqu&eacute; at lightening speeds.  The production is superb and the cut is enjoyable - not the second coming.  The other bonus tracks are remixes - \\"Let's Have a Kiki (DJ Nita Remix)\\" and \\"F*** Yeah (Seamus Haji Remix).\\"<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B007ZKY7XO Magic Hour [Deluxe Edition]]]  is flawed.  The best moments appear at the forefront while the back half of the effort is blander and not nearly as well conceived.  Had some of the less enthralling cuts been replaced with more thrilling one or been slightly better though-out, Magic Hour would have most certainly been a stronger effort. The band's debut remains their strongest affair to date.s\\" does contrast with a six-eight feel and more of a ballad-driven approach.  \\"Somewhere\\" closes the standard version with a driven groove, though brings nothing new to the table.<br /><br />The deluxe version includes four additional tracks.  \\"Ms. Matronic's Magic Message\\" serves as a short interlude and introduction to the bonus cuts (no harm, no foul).  \\"F*** Yeah\\" is incredibly manic, finding Shears rapping, incredibly risqué at lightening speeds.

B0074MZSWW|5.0|Alabama Shakes is the best band to come out of North Alabama, since the Drive-By-Truckers. Although their sound recalls the R&B/Soul Sounds of Arethra Franklin, Otis Redding, & others, their Sound is still \\"VERY ORIGINAL & UNIQUE\\", mixing R&B, Blues, & Soul, along with Rock. \\"ALABAMA - SHAKES - RATTLES & ROLLS\\" on this album. And that line refers back to the 1950's hit \\"Shake, Rattle & Roll\\". The lead vocalist Brittany Howard, is totally \\"awesome\\" with her vocals, plus she plays the guitar, piano, & some percussions. Other band members include: Zac Cockrell on Bass guitar, guitar & backing vocals, Heath Fogg on guitar, backing vocals & some percussion, Steve Johnson on Drums, percussions, and backing vocals. Also this album includes several other backing studio musicians.<br /><br />I sincerely hope this is the first of many more albums to come, by this great new band. I hope this review helps to spread the news about just how good, this new band really is. This band was on the cover & featured in the Magazine \\"American Songwriter\\" for the March/April 2012 issue. I highly recommend this Debut Album by this Great New Southern Band. Thanks!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so happy the finilly got this game.I bin waging for ever for it to come out. it rocked
B00846F1YW|5.0|When I got finished with the first level I could not figure out how to get to the next level.  I tried the cheats but they did not tell me.  So for those of you who have the same problem there is a tiny x in the upper right corner of the box where you can leave feedback on facebook and twitter.  That is how to get to the next level.
B000YQSYSA|2.0|If you take out about 30 songs, you would have a decent album........the entire second cd is blah, one annoying ballad after another, nothing interesting instrumentally, a waste of time. Some real gems on there though, like the song about the first kiss - brilliant!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book.  It is a must read.  I read all 3 books in one weekend.  I hope you enjoy reading them.  They are for adults only!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I did every thing and could not get this to download always something.  Like they say you get what you pay for which in this case was NOTHING!!
B0041XOJ7C|5.0|I purchased the book simply based upon the title. It was more or less, an impulse purchase which typically are somewhere between foolish and a disaster.<br /><br />This however, was a great move.<br /><br />The book is exceptional. It provides step by step actions and \\"rules\\" for those of us who are not terribly fond of the norm. A must read for entrepreneurs, it is filled with inspirational ideas and suggestions for starting a business, travel or adding to existing practices.<br /><br />The writing style is also smooth and easy to navigate. It took me all of 2 days at an easy pace to cover this.<br /><br />I would say it is a must read.

B0074VTHKM|5.0|As someone who worked for a law firm for 7 years, I found these books to be just adorable.  Sounds a little infantile to say that, I suppose, but Grisham makes this kid smart, respectful, inquisitive, helpful, insightful, all the things you want your kids to embrace.  He shows kids that lawyers aren't all dirt bags even though tv shows make them look that way.  I may be a 59 year old grandma, but I loved the first two books and look forward to getting the audio version of this one so I can listen while sitting at the pool on board a cruise ship knitting!
B00000J7SS|5.0|This is by far the best Miles Davis album. It knocks his other classics like \\"Kind of Blue\\" and \\"Sketches of Spain\\" out of the park. Although it is hard to compare \\"Brew\\" to those to fantastic albums because of the obvious changes in style but I still feel as if this is the ultimate peice of work from Miles Davis. The only Miles Davis album that really comes close to matching the crazy wild feeling this album has is \\"Live Evil\\", which was originally intended to be the predecessor to this album. I have heard many jazz albums but this one is my favorite hands down. If you consider yourself a fan of jazz music or if you want to hear something truely groundbreaking then get this now.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely love the results from this DVD!  I think the people who give it low scores either A. don't pay attention to what Jillian says about following the \\"modified\\" moves if you are experiencing difficulties OR B. they like to complain!

0307730697|5.0|FEARLESS takes you deep into SEAL Team SIX, straight to the heart of one of its most legendary operators.<br /><br />When Navy SEAL Adam Brown woke up on March 17, 2010, he didn't know he would die that night in the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan, but he was ready: In a letter to his children, not meant to be seen unless the worst happened, he wrote \\"I'm not afraid of anything that might happen to me on this Earth, because I know no matter what, nothing can take my spirit from me.\\"<br /><br />But long before Adam Brown became a member of the elite SEAL Team SIX--the counterterrorism unit that took down Osama bin Laden--there was a fun-loving country boy from Arkansas whose greatest goal had been to wear his high school's football jersey. An undersized daredevil, prone to jumping off roofs into trees and off bridges into lakes, Adam was a kid who broke his own bones but would never break a promise to his parents.<br /><br />But after high school, Adam fell in with the wrong crowd, and his family watched as his appetite for risk dragged him into a downward spiral that eventually landed him in jail. Battling his inner demons on a last-chance road to redemption, Adam had one goal: to become the best of the best - a U.S. Navy SEAL.<br /><br />FEARLESS is the story of a man of extremes, whose determination was fueled by faith, family, and the love of a woman. It's about a man who waged a war against his own worst impulses and persevered to reach the top tier of the U.S. military. Always the first to volunteer for the most dangerous assignments, Adam's final act of bravery led to the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />FEARLESS is the intimate story of a devoted man who was an unlikely hero but a true warrior, described by all who knew him as just that--fearless.<br /><br />Even though this is not the type of book I typically read, when I had the chance to read Fearless, I jumped for it. And let me tell you I'm very glad I read this book.<br /><br />This was a very gripping, true story by author Eric Blehm. A book filled with detail and emotion. A book not easily put down and one hard to read without shedding tears.<br /><br />The story of Adam Brown - from his childhood to his tragic death. This book tells of his dark teenage years to his wonderful wife's courage and persistent love. This book also tells of what goes into the making of SEAL. Most importantly, though it shows how the love of Jesus can change a sinners heart.<br /><br />This was a great book to read on Memorial Day weekend as it helped me to appreciate what all those in the military go through while I live my life in freedom and unaware of all they go through. I also gained a new appreciation for the spouses of those in the military, they sacrifice so much as well.<br /><br />This book also helped me realize when I think I'm having a bad day it is nothing compared to things Adam went through while in training or after he was in the Army. It also made me hug my loved ones closer, we never know how much time we have with them.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was a good book, and I'm looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />If your looking for a Epic style Fantasy book. Then here you go.<br /><br />Get the word out about this book. It looks like it's going to be a hell of a story.
B0086700CM|5.0|best app ever my friend lemme play this on her ipad now im so happy to play on my kindle
B0069UP2PI|2.0|Realistically, if this film didn't have so many big name stars would anyone have bothered watching it based on the premise alone?<br /><br />I hate to say it, but summing it up, this movie left me cold.  I was not even a little impressed.  Yes, it was well intentioned, but on a whole, it barely rose above a public service announcement: cover your mouth when you cough and use a lot of hand sanitizer.  That, and don't mix your bats with your pigs.  Like who does!?<br />I also found the pacing dead slow until, inexplicably (under time constraints?), there was a rush to wrap everything up.  Well, not everything, there were a few glaring loose ends that I also found annoying.  Why bother mentioning something if you're not going to follow through with it?  In addition, the flashback coda was a bit pretentious and not a little insulting; got the point, no need to hit us over the head with a sledgehammer.<br />So glad I didn't buy it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so excited!!! this is the only app that I wanted from the appetite that wasn't on amazon.my life is complete!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best game ever! you need this game get it now or else. want some treasure play now!
B000QGAU4E|3.0|POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!<br /><br />I liked the movie all the way through but the end? WTF? Did they run out of film? I don't understand, what was the point, whats the score here, what comes next? I mean I liked every bit of it but when the credits rolled I was left like a deer in the headlights, Almost as if someone cut out the last 5 minutes of the film from my mind so thats how the movie seemed to me, like it was missing an ending. Maybe thats just me, but whatever.
B004US4K2C|5.0|I love the dock bar, swipe gestures, and folders. Between those things, I only have 3 desktop pages (and current only use 2 of them).<br /><br />NOTE: Amazon currently has an older version 3.01.  The current version is 3.02. There are lots of changes in the newest release.  Also, the Amazon Appstore App wants to &quot;upgrade&quot; (downgrade actually) to 3.01.  Get it from Google's Play Store and get real updates...<br /><br />It's still the best launcher I've ever tried...And I've tried and paid for many...
B0086700CM|5.0|I have to admit. I did'nt get what all the fuss was about. so when it became free I downloaded it. have not been able to stop playing since. now.... I got it ...and I love it!
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is amazingly addictive. now they need to get jetpack joyride. glad that they got this app. recommend it to anyone.
B005FITIGO|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I'd say even Boiler Room is better.  Also, the male actors are so ugly: and I expected eventually a gay sex scene with the two gay-looking young floor traders, but nothing sexual in this movie.  Also, it's basically a cigarette and alcohol commercial, with non-stop \\"tough\\" foul language.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I thought this series was truly a breath of fresh air.  I couldn't put it down.  Some people may be offended or turned away from the sexual content.  But, personally, I didn't find it distasteful in any way.  I found myself completely drawn to Christian and how he developed as a character.  Truly... a great read.<br /><br />************<br /><br />Leaving my previous review.  I actually re-read the books.  Sooooooooo dull.  The author has an incredible lack of description.  It can be descriptive without being pornographic.  But with what she is writing, the fact that she can't use the scientific, dry vernacular to describe genitalia was irritating.  Every time I saw the words \\"down there\\" I rolled my eyes.  I found myself getting more and more irritated with it the more I read.  I did like that it wasn't flowery with the sex.  But people made a huge to-do about it being about BDSM, but it's really not.  The main male character, Christian, is into it.  But you would have expected so much more with how people made a big deal about it.  I don't know.  That and the only time Christian seemed like an actual man was when he was having sex.  Every other time, he was a little too in touch with his feminine side.  And for a guy who likes violent sex... I wouldn't take him as the type to be in touch with that at all.  Yeah.  After reading it the second time, I was really let down.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very fun to play and I am planning start playing it right after I finish this review.
B003GX5CWY|5.0|Now this is one of those movies that makes you say about movies today \\"they don't make them like they used to\\". Every part of this movie is classic. All the characters, all the lines, all the scenes, the action, the gore, the craziness, the thrills and suspense, 100% classic.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, you are really missing out on one of the best movies ever made!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|my high score is 67,599,675 and thats without any glitch it has no bugs at all it is a fun time passer
B007PS0X0W|4.0|I recently saw this movie for the first time and it was very good. I enjoyed the whole thing, I remember though it was a bit short but other than that it was really good and bursting with action!!<br /><br />I really with there would have been some closure in the end with the father but I guess they are saving that for the next part.<br /><br />And I would love to see another part, because it leaves off with many unanswered questions.
B0086700CM|5.0|FINALLY I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS F$*#%&amp;@ GAME TO COME OUT FOR THE KINDLE FIRE. MY FIRE IS COMPLETE.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|We enjoyed this movie thoroughly from beginning to end!! It's filled with action and twists and turns. It's lots of fun and I can't wait to see the next one. Now you know it's a good movie when it ends, you are thinking about how long you have to wait for the next part. Love the characters as well. It made you apart of what was going on. You felt the suspense and the thrills. Super awesome movie!! No complaints what so ever. Loved it completely.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. Perfect if you like logic puzzles. It sort of reminds me of a cross between sudoku and minesweeper. Comes with plenty of puzzles to keep you occupied for many hours. My only gripe is that this game drains my battery faster than expected. Played on a g2x.
B0047SF41G|2.0|I remember being so excited to see this movie and as I watched it, I kept waiting for something to happen, something interesting, something intriguing, something that made me gasp or scream or was interesting but it never delivered. This is one of those movies where you could care less about the characters, and you just sit through it waiting for it to be over. Very disappointing movie and nothing like the original. In fact it's a shame that this movie has a similar title and is associated with the original Predator movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best runner type game ive ever seen!!! Really feels like ur running from killer monkeys. McDonalds theme song... Im Lovin It!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Very fun to build your own little village. This game is similar to the Sims games. The animals and their families are very entertaining.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|this to me looked as a right on option for a new area purchaser as myself,<br />lotta searches over amazon, fiio comes up frequently, i' baught into this e6,<br />im using it with my motorolla/boost, 1920 device. the i290 does have use<br />media player. it as far as i can tell uses a card sd no larger the 2gb with<br />internal storage. the sound from the MINENG headphones, is rival to my old<br />koss porta pro set, i needed a 2.5mm male to 3.5mm female plug its a nokia.<br />the fiio, is a plastic wich i personaly do not want, its two clips, in case.<br />a usb recharge wire, a male to male 3.5mm wire. 2 of those i think. the lights<br />are small hard to see. the light indicator for its amp is bright changing from<br />red/blue/red&blue. or OFF. blank not white. the volume controll of it also<br />changed a the media on the i920 device, which was unexpected if you hold it for<br />a peroid of time. the feed back from the head phones is loud, already. this decivce added<br />bass, with sacraficing quality, same with the blue setting, the blue&red setting did not add<br />a quality or level of sound noticed compaired to the black setting on this amplifier.<br /><br />would not reccmend this purchase paired with a device like the one mentioned.
B006VUPCEM|4.0|Coming from the line of \\"Dennis Ward Musical Entreprises\\", I thought this would be another so and so melodic/metal album. It is melodic. It is catchy. But it is not so and so!<br /><br />A great surprise for me. This album is such well-crafted, perfect production-wise, the guitar solos are amazing, Kiske is singing as good as ever.<br /><br />Band line-up:<br /><br />Michael Kiske - v; Kai Hansen - g; Mandy Meyer - g; Dennis Ward - b; Kostas Zafiriou - d

B0086700CM|5.0|Nobody is going to read this anyway. Just play the silly game,  for crying out loud. What, are you still wasting your time with this review? Look, just install the game and try it out. Why do you need me to tell you how fun it is?
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is by far my most played and most addictive games I have ever played. the only problem I have is the fact my friend beat my high score and I can't beat it!
6305350205|2.0|The Starship Enterprise goes on a spiritual quest in this lackluster fifth installment. An infamous William Shatner vanity project, \\"The Final Frontier\\" (1989) is plagued by the actor's directorial inexperience and a poorly developed script. At least the camera stays in focus. Despite its $28 million budget, \\"Star Trek V\\" plays like a mediocre TV episode and, therefore, fares better on the small screen.
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game. very addictive. tons of fun watching someone play. the monkey things are creepy. love the death screens when you die.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is addictive and you will fall in love it is on a big screen so it is easy to play
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games was recommended by a friend.  I ordered it for my Kendle and read the three books in three days at the beach.  It was impossible to put down even when fatigue or hunger overcame me.

159114325X|5.0|This book contains an outstanding collection of historic photographs on the theme of German capital ships of WW2. As an example of what the reader can expect to find, there are 91 images of the Tirpitz alone spread over the 55 pages. Whilst there is also sufficient text to explain the background and history of each vessel, it is a combination of this high standard of selected photographs coupled with an equally excellent quality of reproduction which makes this book stand apart from the rest.<br /><br />Described as “The Ultimate Photograph Album,” I commenced by glancing through the entire work prior to settling down to study specifics. As I did so, I immediately learned how close Germany came to having an aircraft carrier. I was already aware that only four countries operated carriers at the beginning of WW2 - i.e. Royal Navy, US Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy in addition to which the French also had the B&eacute;arn - although she did spend most of the war interned at Martinique.<br /><br />What I did not previously know, however, was that Germany also came very close to completing the Graf Zeppelin and this book provides an excellent account of that particular ship. Whereas, the attack on Pearl Harbour, closely followed by the loss of HMS’ Prince of Wales and Repulse, demonstrated to the entire world the effectiveness of air power against big ships - both in harbour and at sea, this book provides a further example of Hitler’s military incompetence by revealing how he withdrew the funds required for completing the vessel - which was never finished.<br /><br />Elsewhere, there are accounts of other German ships all of which are, as I say, fully supported by great photographs. More importantly, I did not find any of the information lacking in any way.<br /><br />Altogether, this as an outstanding work which is unlikely to disappoint anyone. With so many ships being photographed from just about every conceivable angle, it should also prove useful to serious ship modellers.<br /><br />NMmodellers.<br /><br />NM
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|I tried to play this video, had company to watch it with me. Wont play. I will try it again, if not I will need to return the DVD
B0086700CM|4.0|I like the app but the only reason it didn't get a five star was because it has a slow reaction
B00129H7VS|5.0|I have the dvd version and I would rate it 5 stars..when I look at the reviews for the blueray version..I am basically looking to see if the quality is that much better..I've seen that older movies that were redone in the blueray format were so so..
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love this product. It is fun to play on. It really makes you think. I would get this product again.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run and I just couldn't wait any longer for it to come out on the kindle fire. I mean every now and then it will have a few glitches but it is the most funniest and most addictive game ever!!!!!
0307719219|5.0|Excellent book.  Provides the framework, concepts, terms and historical background for discussions of how and why societies prosper and progress, and how and why they stagnate and regress.  Lays the foundation for future modeling and analysis of the impact of political and economic choices based on the effect of \\"inclusive\\" and/or \\"extractive\\" constructs.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone interested in predictive political and economic modeling.<br /><br />The book is eminently readable for anyone interested in the consequences of economic/political choices and provides excellent and extensive historical accounts of how past choices and circumstances have influenced the outcomes.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think that game is the most addicting game I have ever played in my life. It is fun too!
1572816112|5.0|This deck sits out on my tarot reading table at all times. It is one that I thought would be too dark for my tastes, and frankly I never thought I would own a copy! When I bought it, it was with trepidation. Would the figures Patrick Valenza created speak to me? I was certain I would find the deck creepy.<br /><br />But from the moment it arrived, I have adored it.<br /><br />I find the characters, dare I say, endearing. Flawed, perhaps, and maybe it is my perception of them as flawed beings, or imperfect beings, that draws me to them. If they were perfect and haughty, I think I would find it harder to relate to them. But they seem playful, imperfect, interesting, intruiging. Not scary at all like I had thought!<br /><br />I especially like such touches such as the elimination of suit names on the pips as Patrick realized it is completely unnecessary to have the suits in large type (or in any type whatsoever) on the cards. That means a card like the 10 of Wands, I can just look at the actual artwork, and in a very small and unobtrusive typeface, Patrick has put a \\"X\\" for 10. I can clearly see that it is Wands from the image. I do not need the suit spelled out for me. This is so refreshing to see, that the majority of the image is just that: image. It is clear that Patrick thought about this and requested it. Granted, Stuart Kaplan still had his way and printed the copyright on the cards' borders. But it is small. The cards are so perfect in every other way that I wish the copyright wasn't there.<br /><br />Readings that I do with this deck are spot-on.<br /><br />I have both the slippery Italian print and the Chinese print. But I love the Italian print. I don't mind the gloss at all! In fact, in comparing the Chinese and Italian printings, I will be the rogue and state that I prefer the Italian print.  I like the uber-glossy, indestructible quality to it. But wait, there's more.<br /><br />I also like the COLORS better. Having worked in magazine publishing for sometime, I can say that the Deviant Moon Italian printing has true \\"white\\" in it, whereas the Deviant Moon Chinese version, frankly, does not. The colors, while they may seem better to some, are \\"off\\" in that you must start with a true white/true black. The Deviant Moon Chinese printing, which some have called darker, I call \\"muddy.\\" I mean the colors, not the crispness of detail. Detail is fine.<br /><br />The colors in the Italian printing are brighter, more jewel toned. I can READ with that deck. Frankly, I cannot read with the Chinese printing. No way, no how. Totally different feel to the deck.<br /><br />In addition, there is a third factor: For the first time, I received an ultra-smelly deck. My Deviant Moon from China smelled horribly of chemicals when I first received it. This faded with time.<br /><br />Fourth, the card stock on the Chinese printing. Yes, it isn't uber-glossy. Yes, it is matte. But it looks like after a few shuffles it will start to get chipped or damaged. It is not a nice, indestructible card stock as in the days of old with the more vintage decks. They have made a matte card stock, but at what price? It seems more like a veneer, if that makes any sense. Like a very thin veneer, that once it comes off, the entire card is vulnerable.<br /><br />I do not see these Printed in China decks lasting. They seem more like imposters to the decks of old that were truly matte. I find myself actively looking for decks printed in Italy.<br /><br />Plus, frankly the darker colors of the Chinese version do NOT read as well for me, and those bright, snappy colors, so welcome in a deck with such ... colorful yet somber inhabitants, are perfect for the deck. To see them muddied about as they were in the Chinese printing just didn't do it for me. I think Patrick said the Chinese version was more his original vision of how the colors would be, but for me the one that really SINGS~~~~!! is the Italian printing. The Italian printing was also the one used in that perfume commercial in Oprah magazine!<br /><br />To each his own: compare the Chinese and Italian printings side-by-side and decide for yourself which one is right for you.<br /><br />Back to the deck itself. The deck is a 5-star, must-have deck. Its inhabitants will never fail you in a reading. They are like old friends waiting, under any light, bright or dim, to transmit you to another time and place. They will do for the most practical of readings (or any type of reading) and for many types of questions. They will work with many different types of querents. If your querent isn't put off by the characters in this deck but finds them charming -- if your querent's taste is gothic or avante garde, or indeed if that is your taste, you may have found your deck.<br /><br />But even if that is not your taste, you will be utterly surprised in how this deck will read for you. It will turn your idea of readings on its ear. That is what it did for me. The Deviant Moon is a lovely surprise for a deck. Don't let this one get away.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Play it quit often. Just cant beat the levels. So haven't made it butt to level 5 or so. Like Mario in a way you collect coins get extra men. Jump and move with arrows on Kindle Fire. Commercials are at the bottom of Kindle Fire so it doesn't bother me that much, can play offline as well.
B007MDB71O|3.0|I can't believe this was not a HUGE box office hit!  A great movie from start to finish and a lot of fun.  Can't wait for the DVD to be released so I can watch it again.<br />...<br />I just downgraded my review to 3 stars because of the way Disney is ripping off its customers on the digital copy.  I liked this movie so much, I payed extra to get the version with a digital copy.  Shortly after installing it, I upgraded to a new laptop and tried to re-install the movie.  There is no way to do it!  Each movie comes with a code that can only be used ONE time, so you can only install the movie on ONE device.  (I also discovered this is true of other \\"digital copy\\" movies I bought.)<br />So if you are planning to pay extra to get a digital version thrown in, DON'T DO IT (unless you never plan to get a new computer!)  I'm sure the \\"movie pirates\\" will find easy ways around this scheme.  This only hurts your honest customers.  Shame on you, Disney!
B004GYY714|5.0|Love this app. Can choose tunes of different radio stations and save them. Just not very loud on kindle fire unless you use earphones or get a portable speaker which can be purchased at Rite-aid or C VS. try it don't have to have Facebook account to use it.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is an interesting logic problem game.  I have learned that trying to guess the picture is of minimal help; it is better to sole the puzzle with a thoughtful process of elimination. Good times.
B0086700CM|3.0|it is good and addicting when you get it then it is boring because all you do is run away from demon monkeys
B0034G4P4O|5.0|This is such a fun, action-packed movie to watch! I would be interested to match the plot line against the original cartoon version! It arrived very quickly. Thanks so much!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|It's a good game. Runs well on my Incredible 2. Lots of puzzles. Worth the price if you like puzzles.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love the whole series. The character is so honest and believable. Loved the way this girl thinks and gets things done!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like the game except for the fact that the acorns are too hard to come by considering the amount you need for some of the stuff you have to have to move on.  Currently I have bought all I can with coin generation.  Acorns are far sparser.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Excellent book! I could not put this book down. Its very disturbing but at the end, it was wonderful love story..... Don't know what to read after this one.....Any suggestions???
B0063GORYU|5.0|whether using a single deck for relaxation or multiple decks for a real challenge, spider is a great classic card game
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was \\"captivated\\" by the first book and so I had to press on and continue the story.  My word for this book is \\"intense\\". This book was more intense then the first book by all its twist and turns in the story.  I allowed my 11 yr old to read the first book but this one was a little more \\"grown-up\\" so she will have to wait.  Definitely a must read to continue the story.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a very fun, addictive,  and fast paced game. Temple run is also very frustrating, make you throw your kindle fire kind of game! I can't seem to put it down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Finally, how will this story \\"wrap up\\"?  This book \\"wraps up\\" the whole story and gives a lot of background on some of the characters. This final book was a little more difficult for me to get through.  It didn't grab me as much as the first two but yet I had to know how this difficult story was going to end.  Definitely a lot more violence in this one.  All in all, I'm glad I finished and was glad (sort of) for the way it ended.
B00005JPUN|4.0|All was going well with this entertaining if not intelligent film until the end.  Spoiler alert: The human bad guys beat the alien microbes and the now peaceful and  perfect world is returned to war, violence, poverty, etc.  In other words, the human race continues its destruction of planet Earth.  Nicole Kidman gets to kill a lot of people who are infected and I guess some of you might find that to be sexy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided to read this series because my 11 year old wanted to read it.  As I read, it was difficult for me to find the words to describe how I was feeling about the book. \\"Captivated\\" is the word I came up with.  The circumstances in the book were difficult but the story was captivating.  It is a very good book to read.  I allowed my 11 year old to read the first book only.
B001DF68MA|4.0|My son is 17 months old, fairly tall and fairly thin.  He seems very content and happy in the seat.<br />The foot rests are as low as they will go and appear to be right at the perfect Height for his current age/height.  I expect that he may be growing out of this seat Height wise before next summer but that gives me a full summer of fun this year.<br /><br />The shoulder straps don't stay on the shoulders very well.  I plan to try a couple different things to make sure they will stay on top of his shoulders while we ride.<br /><br />I'm 6 foot and my knees come up to about my sons waist (when he is sitting in the seat) while I'm pedaling.  My knee's do have to move out a little bit more than if he wasn't sitting in front of me but it is not uncomfortable in any way.  It really isn't even noticeable unless I'm actually thinking about it.<br /><br />Due to the fact the seat back only comes up to about his mid back, this seat is not for any rough terrain ridding.  You would want to stay on paved roads or smooth dirt bike trails.  Trails with lots of bumps and turns can get the kid in the seat twisting around a lot.  While going up a very steep hill (15+% grade) my son was pushed back (bending backwards) with each powerful push on the pedals.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with this seat and am looking forward to sunny weekends!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book!  Can't wait for the 3rd book to go on sale!  It was a book that I could not put down, had it read in about 3 days.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|This sort of movie I always say, takes \\"an adquired taste\\". If you liked movies such as [[ASIN:B0007UC8Y4 The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (The Criterion Collection)]], [[ASIN:B000067DHK The Royal Tenenbaums]] and [[ASIN:6305428239 Rushmore]], then you will be right at home with The Darjeeling Limited.<br /><br />A story of three brothers traveling through India; this tale will have you scratching your head from time to time. It is amazing how the director always acomplishes a feeling of familiarity and weirdness that makes each movie a rare jewl in their own terms. This movie is not for everybody, some of my friends have found it to be boring and pointless, but like I said above, if you have seen any of the movies I've listed, then you will pretty much understand the formula of each.<br /><br />At its current price, The Darjeeling Limited shouldn't be passed. I would recommend you watch the ones listed above to truly appreciate Wes Anderson's style. This has been another weird, yet familiar ride that I enjoyed from start to credits.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Right on, Nancy. Marvellously written; incredible research and a TIMEstyle narrative that made for a page turner oops!  kindle fire screening. Really good, my compliments.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|A good read but lacks some of the punch Jack Reacher readers are used to.<br />Maybe getting a bit too predictable...
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is one of the most famous games... U could go around any where asking! I'm so glad it came to androids! So as always, Great!
B000SEFNMS|5.0|although some think mccandless was selfish, i understand where he was coming from. He needed a drastic change in his life and he grabbed life by the stones and went out and lived. Although i will likely never go on any sort of adventure like his, his story reminds me to not just sit around gathering moss. Go out and live life so that there are no regrets. I spent the early part of my life not really doing much but working and taking the occasional vacation. I recently moved out to the west after spending my entire life in one slow, flat, boring city in the midwest.  I left all of my family behind in search of a new life...a life, period. Theres not a day that goes by that i'm not thankful for the opportunities to experience what the pacific northwest has to offer. I wasnt living when i was in the midwest - i was merely existing. Now i wake up every day loving life. Chris mccandless did the ultimate to grab life by the horns and experience nature. I see him as an inspiration. He did what he felt he needed to do to feel alive. If i would have continued to exist the rest of my life in the midwest, i would have probably died with a LOT of what-if's in my head.

1451627289|5.0|Thrilling journey into the past and future.  This is a book you can not stop reading.  I did not want it to end.
B000ID1J0E|4.0|[[ASIN:B000ID1J0E Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]<br />Worth a watch. Pretty strange and funny film.... I can't believe I hadn't seen it before until my husband forced me. I'm glad he did.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very fun!I cant stop playing! I was so excited when I found out it came on kindle fire .it was my favorite game on my sisters ipad and now its my game! :)
B002UM5BXW|4.0|you'll like this book.  Written very much in his informal, shoot from the hip, no holds barred manner, the book is an entertaining run-up to his current fame.  It was enjoyable to read about his journey, warts and all.  And I certainly look at restaurants and eating differently since...look forward to reading more, and his new show on CNN.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is so much fun! I like it better that an ipod because I can actually press the right button. I highly recommend this app for anyone who wants it!
0439023513|4.0|I've read some reviews of this series and have to write my own now that I've read all 3 books.  I liked The Hunger Games - that book was the lead-in to the horrors and slavery the Districts have endured for 74 years.  Then it was pretty much about how each tribute dies in the arena, but also very good and kept me riveted.  What I liked most was that at the end of the 1st book, I couldn't wait to know what was going to happen next and to get the 2nd book, Catching Fire. I liked the 2nd better than the 1st because there was more of the rebellion firing up and all the twists and turns of each chapter I didn't expect that lead you to the next chapter and the next, until the last page of that book made me want even more.  I felt the 3rd book, Mockingjay, was the best of the three.  A story of human endurance during times of war and basic human survival.  Even though you are reading it through Katniss' eyes, with her thoughts and feelings, you feel more than just whatever Katniss is feeling as she views the other characters.  This is a story of suppression by a dictator of an entire country and the war to end that suppression -not a story about a brave girl who volunteered to take her sister's place in the arena and ultimately triumphs over evil. It's about what being in the middle of a war must be like - lives and love lost and torn, hope brutally crushed and raised up again, and whole societies destroyed, then slowly rebuilding with that faint glimmer of hope about what might be possible to make life better - or if not better then a sincere attempt at what's \\"right.\\"<br /><br />I read reviews that said too many people were introduced in the 3rd book, it got confusing and then they were gone, but every character who came and went was well introduced and needed for the story. I read complaints that Gale just seems to \\"disappear\\" - but he doesn't disappear, his and Katniss' relationship plays out until the end, so I don't know what book those people read.  I read complaints that said Katniss \\"hides\\" through most of the 3rd book - well, she does hide at times, when most of us probably would, too, because she's a 17-18 yr. old girl who became an unwilling pawn of those in power (on both sides) and an unwitting symbol of hope for an entire country when all she was originally trying to do was survive.  This book wouldn't be the good read that it is if she suddenly became like Wonder Woman, rose up, lead the rebels singlehandedly to victory and everyone lived happily ever after.  I read that people have been disappointed at the end of Mockingjay, but I truly believe that this book ended exactly as it should have, and is something we all can learn from - what our soldiers past, present and future, deal with upon coming home from active combat (i.e., the \\"arena\\") with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and try to adjust to a normal life, which Katniss, Peeta, Finnick, Annie, Johanna and others all suffered from in their own way.  Next time you see a soldier in uniform on the street, thank him, because he probably has witnessed similar violence and death as in Mockingjay - granted on a more realistic basis, but just as real nonetheless.  While this is a \\"young adult\\" series, I'm 52 and enjoyed it immensely.  I actually miss Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch and the others now that I'm done.  I wanted to read each book far into the night, but I also didn't want to read so fast that it was over with too soon.  This is a great series from the first word to the last in all 3 books, and I can't imagine any other ending than the one Suzanne Collins chose.  I felt very calm when I read the last page of Mockingjay - and that felt \\"right.\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thumbs up for Suzanne Collins! The Hunger Games made me hungry for more of the brutally sweet plot. There is something heartwarming about the story, beneath all the fight scenes, violence, deception and politics. The romance is a bit toned down but it is not a cheesy love story after all. This modern war story definitely made my blood boil.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|pretty cool game. a leprechaun Mario. controls are easy to usevery addicting.cool graphice and easy to follow.downlaod you will love this game. I love how you collect all the coins and travel to different worlds.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it. keeps me busy. no bugs so far. have it on my kindle and on my ipod. thanks!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|We have now seen the movie twice - and my daughter convinced me to read the Trilogy.  I bought it through my Kindle app (on my Droid X2 phone), but could share it with my iPad as well as both of my daughter's iPod Touches and my husband's Droid.  It's nice that we can all read it on our separate devices at the same time!  Very cool!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Its awesomly addicting! love the graphics and gameplay. lots of Mb but worth it, and i havent had any problems so far!
B007PBL9KC|4.0|even though the entire album was 4-star there was definitely 5-star singles. Dirty Paws has a very different story line that makes no sense, yet has a catchy tune that makes it amazing. Little Talks is by far the best, the way the male and female voices come together are a dynamic combination.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Excellent classic tween-teen read.  Required for most middle and early high school English literary requirements. Some kids find it easier to read aloud in order to master the dialect cadence.
B00377Z0Y4|5.0|I don't generally give a damn about Christmas music, but I listened to this at a friend's suggestion and it's fantastic.
141694737X|5.0|We received this book for Christmas when my daughter was 11 months old.  She still wants to read it each night.  I think there is a reason this book is still in print...namely that it appeals to a wide age range of babies and toddlers, for different reasons.  At first, my daughter just looked at the animals, then she started opening the flaps, and now she is interested in saying the animals' names and making their sounds.  It is a great interactive book.
