B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I ordered this cover at the same time I ordered my Kindle Fire because I wanted the lightest cover possible--at least to start--because I planned to carry the Fire with me in my backpack (a small backpack serves as my purse) at least some of the time.<br /><br />This Microshell Folio Cover definitely wins in the lightness department, though I was shocked there was so little to it.  Instead of having bands to hold the Fire in the cover, the Fire snaps right into the plastic back of this cover. It fits well--my Fire has never fallen out of it or even budged much, and it gets a lot of jostling in my backpack--though mine never seems to seat 100% in the case (one edge always seems to be standing out from the case).<br /><br />There is a thin flap that goes over the front of the Fire (this I was a bit disturbed by when it first arrived) and an elastic strap goes around that to keep the cover closed.  It didn't seem adequate protection for the way I was going to be transporting the Fire at first, but it has been okay so far.  I still don't feel 100% comfortable that it is adequate protection, but I am less worried than I was on first sight.<br /><br />Where this cover really fails, in my experience, is the stand. That flimsy flap over the front of the Fire is what constitutes the stand. There is a groove in the back of the plastic case that the flap is supposed to catch to form the stand.  In my experience, it works OK hands-free if I am sitting in a restaurant with the Fire on the table to watch a TV episode or read a book while I'm eating. However, in ANY other than that perfect hands-off condition, I have found the stand to be a pretty big failure.  Note that the stand works much better when the Fire is turned on one side better than the other.  But which side do many of the Fire applications use? That's right--the side where the stand doesn't work as well.  I like to use the Fire on my lap in the evening when I'm watching TV and for this purpose the stand is way too flimsy and unstable.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />4 stars for lightness of the case/ease of carrying.<br />4 stars for the back of the case that the Fire snaps into.<br />2 stars for the front flap as front protection for the Fire.<br />2 stars for the front flap as a stand.<br /><br />Average: 3 stars<br /><br />Not highly recommended unless the weight of the cover is your highest priority.ary:  4 stars for lightness of the case/ease of carrying.  4 stars for the back of the case that the Fire snaps into.  2 stars for the front flap as front protection for the Fire.  2 stars for the front flap as a stand.

B0041KKYBA|2.0|The filmmakers seem to have well learned from Michael Moore and Fox News how to pander and slander to please their audience. While there are nuggets of fact included, there is also a lot of hand-waving misdirection and careful soundbite editing to distract the audience from noticing when non sequitur and unsupported conclusions are delivered to lend apparent support to the filmmakers' agenda. The filmmakers sabotage interviewees who don't deliver the answers they want by includes footage where they are searching for a word or phrase or composing their thoughts, footage where they misspeak, by cutting away after asking rhetorical questions, and including exclamations of incredulity by the ridiculous \\"interviewer\\" to guide the audiences responses. No such treatment of \\"friendly witnesses\\".   There is some good information included but the misinformation and manipulation surrounding it leads me to suspect the truth of even those things I'm sure they got right.   It's shameful that this shoddy piece of work was even nominated for an Academy Award let alone actually being awarded one.
1451627289|5.0|Ever since King's early work (The Stand, Misery, The Shining) he seems to have been just a prolific writer of mediocracy.  This book is his big comeback!  In probably the best book of have read in 2011, King grabs the reader from the beginning with excellent characters, an interesting story proposition all in a setting that actually transports the reader back in time to experience the late 50's going up to the fateful day of Novemenber 22, 1963.  Jake Eppling is an English teacher whose good friend Al at the diner, all of a sudden looks to have aged overnight and seems have have lost about 30 pounds in a day.  Al decides to let Jake into a little secret.  Under Al's diner is a portal to the past specifically to 1958.  Jake thinks Al is crazy but Al gets Jake to go through on a \\"test\\" run.  Jake finds out that what Al says is true.  Al then starts telling Jake about his experiences in the past as well as explaining the rules.  Al says that while you could spend years in the past, only about 2 minutes passes in the present.  On Al's last excursion he spent a few years and that is why he appeared to age overnight.  Al had done many experiments and found that he could alter the present by changing things in the past.  However, each time he went into the past there is a \\"reset\\" and everything is back as it was in 1958 and the present gets reset to its original history.  Al is dying from cancer and has little time to live.  He begs Jake to do what he couldn't do on his last mission to the past and that is stay around to meet up with Lee Harvey Oswald and prevent him from carrying out the JFK assasination.  Jake has to act quickly because the diner is to be turned over to a developer who will level it at the end of the month.  Al gives Jake a new identity as George Amberson and provides him with all his notes about Lee Harvey Oswald.  Jake eventually takes on the mission but finds everything may not be the way Al described as there may be bigger forces involved that Al didn't understand.  During George's (Jake's) time in the past he meets incredibly intriguing indivduals and builds a life that he really didn't have in the present.  All through George has to decide whether he should give up his mission and enjoy his good fortune to be in a much better life than he had in 2011.  The timeperiod literally comes to life and the reader seems to be right there in the past, seeing the sights, hearing the sounds, tasting the tastes that George experiences.  George starts getting a sense that the past has almost a soul of its own and will try to prevent anyone from changing it.  The reader notices that a lot of the clues are given by the mysterious \\"Yellow Card Man\\", that both George and Al had encountered.  The book is one of King's larger ones along the size of \\"It,\\" however it is a much better read than \\"It\\" was.  It is interesting that the characters from that book are referred to several times in this book and parts of the book take place in Derry.  I hope that King can stay on a roll and put out a few more books that match the quality of this one!
0316056863|4.0|I've never watched 30 Rock, but then I guess not many people do, despite its critical acclaim. Although Tina Fey doesn't consider herself particularly adept at impressions, she certainly does a spot-on Sarah Palin. She also does some other funny voices, and for this reason, I recommend the audiobook, which she reads herself. (The last CD has photos and video clips as a bonus.) She covers a lot of ground, from being a late-in-life family addition to her contemplation of having a second child and how that decision impacts the fate of her TV show and its hundreds of employees. She's definitely a soaring example of how to laugh at one's self--from her myriad self-deprecating comments about her looks, to her interview with Lorne Michaels for a position as a writer for Saturday Night Live. I loved the irony in the fact that she has no particular difficulty shouldering her role as \\"bossypants\\" for 30 Rock but can't bring herself to scold the nanny for cutting her daughter's fingernails too short. There's also a healthy dose of feminism, broached with humor, ranging from Second City's preference for a male majority in their traveling improv groups, to her response to several pundits who proclaim that women are not funny. She's certainly proven them wrong.

0062068423|5.0|1st book translated into English but the 3rd in the Harry Hole series.<br /><br />This is a complex Norwegian thriller, a fabulous modern day mystery influenced by captivating and informative flashbacks from events and roles Norwegians were forced into during WW11.<br /><br />The story begins with Harry Hole, the protagonist, a gifted policeman, who caused his department a high profile embarrassment and was subsequently relegated to surveillance work monitoring neo-Nazi activities, a punishment Harry quickly turns into a new challenge.<br /><br />Harry's speculative mind and acquired skills are just what is needed when word on the street surfaces that someone in the underworld is looking for a very particular vintage sniper rifle. He knows he is on the right track when a former Nazi sympathiser is found silenced with his throat cut and victims of the vintage sniper rifle start to accumulate. From the very first the reader follows the path that Harry takes and also the path the sniper takes, creating a unique suspense, a proverbial high gear cat and mouse game .<br /><br />The tale's WW11 tread slowly interweaves into the main as the pages go by. This is a page-turner at its best with narratives that move between Harry's present day inquiries and the Eastern front in 1944, where a small group of Norwegian Nazis with their own agenda are fighting alongside the Germans and at some point switch their allegiance to Russia and become part of the Resistance.<br /><br />The plot is a gripping tale of political intrigue, love and a serial killer with multiple personalities. This fairly long novel is character driven, a rich creation brilliantly composed with every key stroke. I found it hard to grasp at first there were a lot of seemingly unrelated events happening at a rapid pace, I wondered where all the pieces of the puzzle fit, but gradually the pattern took shape and the confusing flashbacks suddenly became clear as the thrill of the mystery escalated.<br /><br />This police procedural novel is one of the most captivating and compelling stories I have read in a long time.

1455510319|5.0|Book 4 in the Mickey Haller series<br /><br />If you are a fan of Hollywood spun down and dirty courtroom scenes, you won't be disappointed with this one. Michael Connelly's latest novel is a real blast and one of the best legal dramas I have read in a long time.<br /><br />\\" The Fifth Witness\\" exploits the scandal in the USA that developed around the sometimes unethical means employed in the bundling and reselling of mortgage loans and the live altering grief it caused some of the homeowners. Lisa Trammel is one of those clients, who should never have been lured into such a deal, but now is faced with losing her house and hope for the future. To make things worse, she is also accused of murdering the ruthless banker who was tasked with forcing the issue. Lucky for her, Haller is up for the challenge and is defending her in court.<br /><br />Mr. Connelly is undoubtedly a master of courtroom drama, the main part of this novel describes Lisa's trial and Mickey's defence strategy. His writing paints a clear picture of the three way battle of wits between attorneys and the judge. The constant war of words between the attorneys, each one trying to score points but looking at the evidences from completely opposing angles is vividly created and provides all the twists and turns needed to heighten the reader's interest to the end. Your mind mirrors the adrenaline swings the defendant experiences.<br /><br />The story is very dynamic, quite suspenseful and character driven. The trial of Lisa Trammel turns into a chess match, with Haller highly skilled at seeing the value of each move. He is a defense lawyer who understands that a trial is not a search for the truth but rather a game of survival where winner takes all. This novel has great characterization. Mickey's team consists of his ex-wife Lorna, his investigator Cisco and an associate Jennifer Aronson. All three of them work alongside Mickey to ensure that Lisa Trammel has the best defense possible. They do not want to be influenced by knowing if she is guilty or not....and Mr. Connelly keeps us wondering and guessing to the very end.<br /><br />The profound plotting with a touch of humour is absolutely absorbing. This was another memorable experience between the pages.lty or not....and Mr. Connelly keeps us wondering and guessing to the very end.

B003Y5H574|5.0|I loved this movie. It was the best movie I have seen in so long. Nice to have a movie that has a sense of humor about real life hardships for all ages. Also appreciated that no one had to be nasty and vulgar to get a laugh.
B0068AWQQ2|2.0|After seeing that people rated this movie a 4 or 5 star I decided I would give it ago, I like vampire and supernatural movies.  However the plot to this movie was severely disappointing.  And it was pretty poorly made.. I suggest finding another movie to rent!
B0063GORYU|5.0|The ads really aren't too annoying for a sponsored app. The game is very responsive.  Perfect for a spider addict!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i enjoyed the writing in this book, her view of how things work, and what they mean to her situation, i feel like I'm reading my own thoughts. I feel like there is a lot of political ramifications in this story that you can see played out. usually politics confuse the crap out of me, but she makes it so much easier to understand how one thing connects to another, how one action affects so many lives, how the lack of action still affects so many lives.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why doesn't he just leave the originals alone and just clean them up? We fell in love with them the way they were, and they made Lucas huge, THE WAY THEY WERE! It's so irritating! Especially since the \\"fixes\\" are completely stupid and unnecessary. WHY?! Don't even get me started on the story changes...there are plenty of fans here who've bitched about everything that ticked me off too...<br /><br />What makes older movies like Star Wars so great is to see what special effects were like in our past. These shows were ground-breaking when they were released. Why not let everyone see them for what they were? Frankly, the effects in the originals were fine, even by today's standards. In fact, CGI can look just like CGI sometimes...fake or cartoon-ish. George Lucas...you WERE a brilliant man...now you're just....irritating! I will keep my original versions thank you. I am dumbfounded that there are any positive reviews. I imagine they are from the new generation who prefer the usually cartoon-like look of CGI and didn't see the originals twenty times before the new BS versions.
B003O86FMW|5.0|once again, good book. though a little slow moving until they move back into the arena, unexpected twists and some delightfully expected turns. I feel like I'm really there, agonizing along with her under the pressure of president snow and all the districts, a forced marriage, and the kick back into the arena.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Once again this was an unexpected find which turned out to be AMAZING.  This without a doubt has become one of my favorite books that I have ever read.  I finished this book in less than a day and have already gone back numerous times to read my favorite parts again. If you're ready to go through a roller coaster of a relationship filled with cautious love, loss, jealousy, sorrow, anger, happiness, and have it all wrapped by a uncondtional love that we all hope for; then this is a book for you.  I found myself going through the emotions with the characters; I laughed, I cried, I felt my heart breaking, I was happy, and I felt the love that Abby and Travis have.  What I mean by \\"cheating\\" is that at one point in the book I found Abby and Travis at a very, very low point and so not being able to take it anymore, I looked at the last few pages.  I needed have a glimpse at the end and even though some may say that would ruin the book, it only made the book that much more special.  I actually found my heart breaking a bit more for Travis and had more sorrow for him.  I loved Abby, however there were a few times that she held her true feelings back and at the time it did not benefit either one of them. The author Jamie McGuire wrote one of the most realistic love stories that I have read.  Of course we all love to see the perfect fairy tale of a love story, but what fun would it be to always know how the story is going to play out and end?  One of the best things that I stumbled across was Jamie McGuire's website where in her Projects section on books to come there is a companion book to Beautiful Disaster through Travis' eyes.  And I absolutely cannot wait.  I'm not sure on the exact date that this book will come out but it will be next year sometime.  I purchased this book for my Kindle app for my iPhone and computer.
0060775858|5.0|I have been reading this book to my daughter since she was only 3 months old.  She didn't like it until about 3 months ago, when she turned about a year old.  She is still excited when I take it off the shelf to read to her.

B004VSTP4Y|4.0|I read this entire series in a week.  Loved the whole complicated story of true love that is almost lost on several occasions due to supernatural circumstances.  Internal struggle, issolation, death, loyalty, strenth, friendship, and love.  Would definately recommend.  Not your average love story or werewolf tale.
B005XN3150|5.0|LOST is my favorite show and nothing has come close to the style of writing or creativity until...Once Upon a Time came along. Giving it a place in line as my second favorite show (Walking Dead being my third). I grew up not liking the fairy tale Disney movies, and gave more attention to movies like the Lion King. Sitting down and watching this show was really hard as I did not want to feel as if I was forced to watch the terrible cartoons of my past. But there is something different about this show and the story lines are amazing. The writers know exactly what they are doing. Give this show a chance and you will not be disappointed. THIS SHOW IS AMAZING!

B0002IVN9W|2.0|There are obviously a lot of fans of this album, and they all rate the most glowing reviews as \\"helpful\\".  I can't say they are wrong, but for me, my advice is to listen to them on Youtube before you buy, or buy a few tracks from Amazon before you commit.  At least 3 songs.  The lead singer's voice may sound intriguing on the first song, but it never changes.  You may love it, or it may just wear on your nerves with its winey-ness.  The echo-chamber effect and fuzzy overlay may be magical or monotonous.  I am certain that I will be attacked now by the true believers, who will insist that either a musical idiot or that I like heavy metal or something.  But I am just saying this album will likely not leave you thinking \\"it's pretty good\\".  It will be either \\"Incredible\\" or \\"I guess it was okay\\".
B002TYZKIM|4.0|Oh Yeah! I love this video and it arrived in mint condition. Will order again from Amazon.com. Yessss!! Amazon is the best. Next???
B005I6EU48|5.0|I almost didn't buy this cover because of some of the reviews. I am so glad that I went with my gut instinct and bought it. It is everything I wanted in a Kindle Fire cover. First, and foremost, it absolutely fits the Kindle Fire. No gaps or loose straps or anything bad. It closes just like a book and when I put it on the shelf next to my antique leather bound books, it looks just like them.  I agonized for two weeks over which Kindle and which cover to purchase. I read almost every review. I did my research. But there was something so appealing about this cover. I like antique books, actually love them. I was so afraid after reading the negative reviews that I almost didn't buy it.  But, once it arrived and I slipped the Kindle Fire into it, I loved it. It felt like leather with suede on the inside, with even a little pocket to keep receipts, etc. The stitching was perfect and the design impeccable.  Oh, and best of all it fits perfectly into my purse. If you love a cover that looks like a real book and not an overpriced cloth notebook, you'll want this one.
0525423281|4.0|I haven't liked a character in a book as much as I liked Cricket (yeah, I hated the name too).  Once he got older he said everything that was on his mind.  I just loved when he was on a page.  I wasn't much of a fan of Lola's, but considering her mommy issues I can sort of understand her journey.  Max, didn't like him.  He was very possessive and jealous.  It didn't help situations when Lola lied to him.  i can't imagine my husband hitting the steering wheel in frustration, like Max did.  That could have gone worse than it did. Anyway, I could have kept reading another two or three chapters if it was available.  I really didn't want to part from Cricket.
B0034G4P94|5.0|This definitely deserves Oscar nods for best film, best actor/supporting actor/whatever for Nolte & Hardy. The writer must have conceived the part of the father for Nolte because they couldn't have found a better person. He also doesn't upstage the movie but plays a backseat/sidecar to the actual story. Simply amazing.
0307269752|3.0|I started reading this two years ago when I got my advance copy from Amazon Vine but stopped before I even got past the prologue.  I simply found it dull, or perhaps I just wasn't in the right mood.  Of course the book became a stateside sensation shortly after that, but I still didn't feel the urge to give it another shot until the American movie's release date started to loom.  I wish I had forced myself to read it back then.  There's a chance I would have been more forgiving of its shortcomings if I hadn't heard so much hype about what a great book it was.<br /><br />As it turns out, most of the story is definitely interesting.  I love Agatha Christie, so when I got far enough to read that it was to be a \\"locked room\\" or \\"island\\" mystery with a limited number of suspects, my hackles were raised and I became more eager to keep reading it.  But as I went along I realized I had probably read TOO much Christie.  I started predicting plot twists before they happened, which sucked some of the fun out of reading.<br /><br />The other thing that acted as a giant vacuum for fun was the last hundred or so pages of the book.  (I will not spoil anything major but if you want zero info about the book's denouement, read no further.)  We have a climactic battle against a surprise serial killer, then we have the main mystery solved and STILL we have about eighty pages to go!  I looked at the book in disbelief wondering what could possibly happen after such exciting revelations that would take up so many pages.  The main character starts off as a disgraced journalist, guilty of libel.  We meet him just after his conviction and sentencing and everything we learn about the case happens after the fact.  The worst thing about this sub-plot is that WE NEVER MEET HIS ANTAGONIST.  The \\"bad guy\\" for this plot is some shady businessman whom we're told again and again is a horrible man, etc. but SINCE WE NEVER MEET HIM, it's hard to conjure up any feelings of loathing for him.  If Larsson had added an extra eighty pages at the BEGINNING of the book instead, letting us see the trial for ourselves and meet the antagonist, perhaps the last eighty pages, where his hero finally gets revenge against the bad guy, would have had some resonance.  But the entire scheme takes place against a literally faceless man and the only other thing that transpires in those eighty pages is a subdued romance.  It's simply not enough, and the entire thing simply takes the air out of the rest of the book's tires, so you go from high excitement to \\"meh\\" in less than an hour.  VERY disappointing.<br /><br />That combined with the rest of the book results in something that I simply don't understand.  Why are so many people in love with this thing?  It's not remotely special or any different from other gory crime novels I've read except that in this one, people stop whatever they're doing every three pages or so to have YET ANOTHER CUP OF COFFEE.  Lisbeth Salander has been portrayed all over the media as some punk-feminist heroine but her actions in the book DIRECTLY contradict that description.  I won't spoil why in my review but when I closed this book I felt like my copy was the only one not laced with whatever high-octane chemical everyone else has clearly been huffing.  What's all the fuss about?  Seriously.  It's just an ordinary, average, run-of-the-mill novel.ighty pages at the BEGINNING of the book instead, letting us see the trial for ourselves and meet the antagonist, perhaps the last eighty pages, where his hero finally gets revenge against the bad guy, would have had some resonance.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|The SB-400 with a Gary Fong diffuser paints light in a precise manner that is just as good (just less power) as the SB-900 with it's built-in whitecard but much more compact and much less weight as well. I save the SB-900 for weddings and large events and the rest of the time the SB-400 is always on my camera. Travels well in a coat pocket. It's simply a must have.  This lens is very very easy on lithium batteries and recharges very quickly.   Perhaps the best selling feature is how well the SB-400 works in concert with Nikon cameras. It takes your mind off correct exposures so you can concentrate on photography and not the equiptment. 3rd party flashes can't hold a candle to Nikon flashes.

0393064476|2.0|I do not really understand the amount of press this book has received.  The authors style of writing, and method of presentation deserve great credit.  However, his bias against religion, and Christianity in particular severly mar the book, and reveal an unwanted bias.  Anyone inclined to read a book on such a topic...the origins of the Renaissance and the Enlightnment is also inclined to form his or her own opinions, and possibly resent being lectured at.
0446691437|5.0|As I started this book, I really did not like what Pressfield was doing -- obliterating my defenses and not being very nice about it. I am a writer who, like many writers, spends a great deal of time not writing. But THE ART OF WAR is a page-turner, so he hooked me. Though the message was not easy, the reading was a breeze -- short, often one-paragraph chapters assured me that the book, at least, would not be another of my unfinished projects. While the inviting format got me in the book, Pressfield's writing made it a pleasure to read some painful truths. His wit, humility and simply good writing engaged me, and I stopped frowning and started nodding my head, and laughing, and, most importantly, taking my creative work seriously.   I keep the book around to pull me -- and the writers I work with -- out of the inevitable Resistance-induced trance. I recommend THE ART OF WAR to writers, artists of all kinds, and anybody who wants to put action behind what they value.

0439023521|5.0|The stark, black and white, post-apocalyptic, world I pictured in my mind while reading Cormac McCarthy's 'The Road' is forever laid out in memory in the film by director, John Hillcoat. The real world after a series, of fires and disasters have destroyed the world we know, and 'The Road' is as visible a film as any I have seen.   Many rumors of this film and how it could never live up to the hype of the novel have been swirling through the Internet. What we have here is a masterpiece of a film. It is a powerful vision of a world ten years after some sort of disaster took over. The scenes were shot in post Katrina, New Orleans, Pittsburgh and what they call the 'Abandoned Pennsylvania Highway'. Into this harrowing world marches a man, played by Viggo Mortensen and his son, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee, trying to find their way to warmth. The coldness of the world is marked, and we can feel the chill. What they encounter is a horror filled world, one in which a group of cannibals keep a farm of humans with missing limbs in their basement. Gangs of marauders around every corner. We see their day to day existence, filthy as they march along, trying to scrape up food to keep alive. They find a house where a left over can of coke amazes the boy, he has never seen it before, and they gorge themselves with food before marching on once again. The stark reality of their life is measured against the gray world where everything is dying. And in this world, the man is teaching his son about goodness versus evil. What we come to see is that the love of this man for his son is the light that may keep this struggle alive. The absence of a God is evident. The pureness of the son may be the antidote.   Charlize Theron plays the mother in a small part, and she portrays the lack of hope that seems so evident throughout the film. Robert Duvall is the Old Man who conveys bits of wisdom. The son wants to help those who are crying for help, but his father tells him they must move on. They can only trust each other. This film is all about the father and his son. Viggo Mortensen is tremendous in this role, and he plays in every scene. The son is as he should be, watchful, hopeful, luminous at times.   The agony of the life that is left to the father and his son is conveyed with such realism. John Hillcoat has captured the feel and the look of the novel. It was difficult at times to keep watching, but then I had to watch. We all want the man and his son to succeed. They are our hope. \\"We're the good guys, they're the bad guys\\" is the message the father is conveying. But deep inside there is the hope that the boy and his father will find more.

B004LWZW4W|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  It starts out solid and ends solid.  I fell asleep halfway through it and woke up at the end of it.  So the middle of the movie is sort of a blur for me.  I'm pretty sure it had something to do with swords made of light and a message that was slightly rascist.  I woke up and caught the end of it, I wont spoil it for you but it was pretty epic.  I think a gorilla threw a wrench at a helicopter at some point in the movie too.  That was pretty cool, I was sitting there thinking \\"There is no way that gorilla has the ability to reason that heaving that wrench at that helicopter with the mounted machine gun is going to knock it out of the sky.\\"  And to my gawking surprise that monkey picked up that wrench and threw it right square at the machine gun helicopter and then the police showed up as they took his father to jail.

At first, it was a little different if you are to compare this sequel to the original Phantom. Think about that....that is great that this production has its own life...it's own originality...and I disagree with most of the customer reviews saying that this sequel does not do the original Phantom of the Opera justice. Just listen to the vocals of Ramin Karimloo...that alone should inspire you!!!

She giggles at all of the little pictures and I think she can actually \\"relate\\" to the little kid in the book.

Previously, I separated my professional engineering training from my entrepreneurial activities, but after reading Gerber's classic, this changed. I strongly recommend anyone in business, thinking about getting in business, or anyone just curious on how successful businesses prosper, to read this book. Gerber's thoughts on making the business the product, and making the franchisee the first and most important customer, can revolutionize anyone's business.
0525948023|5.0|\\"The Power of Now\\" and \\"A New Earth\\" are already highly rated, but I felt compelled to add something of my perspective.   It is true that this book is a retelling of many ancient traditions. But this is the true strength of the book.  This book takes ancient Eastern and Western spiritual knowledge and makes it accessible to 'householders' (i.e. those that live traditional family lives as opposed to those who have dedicated their lives to spiritual pursuits such as monks/nuns).   The simple practical suggestions on the ego, pain body, preoccupation with the past etc., provided in these two books has been very powerful in my life.   I have and would recommend this book to friends and family. Whether you buy this book or \\"The Power of Now\\" because of the book club or the reviews on Amazon, with some simple and practical tools from these two book, I believe it is possible to find more personal peace. It has brought more personal peace into my life.

1594203059|5.0|Niall Ferguson, the young prolific British historian and polemicist, is on my wave-length.    I recently published an article titled \\"The West Versus the Rest: Getting Our Cultural Bearings from Walter J. Ong\\" in the journal of the Media Ecology Association titled EME: EXPLORATIONS IN MEDIA ECOLOGY, volume 7, number 4 (2008): pages 271-282.    Coincidentally, in his new polemical book CIVILIZATION: THE WEST AND THE REST (2011), Niall Ferguson works with the same contrast that I work with in my article. For this reason, he is on my wave-length. But Ferguson needs to upgrade his polemical historical thinking so that he can work with Walter J. Ong's far more penetrating and far more comprehensive and far more irenic account of Western cultural history.    In my article \\"The Western Versus the Rest,\\" I sum up Ong's work from the early 1950s onward. Ong's multivariate account of Western cultural history takes into consideration deeper and more penetrating factors than the also significant factors that Ferguson discusses in his fine book. In my estimate, Ong's work offers a far more cogent explanation for how and why the West is different from all the rest of the cultures in the world historically down to and including today. Therefore, Ong's work complements and strengthens the contrast of the West and the rest that Ferguson works with.    Therefore, those readers who are interested in Ferguson's discussion of certain factors that differentiate the West from the rest of cultures historically down to the present time should also be interested in Ong's extensive body of work about Western cultural history.    Walter J. Ong, S.J. (1912-2003), was an American cultural theorist and religious thinker who held a Ph.D. in English from Harvard University. Walter Jackson Ong, Jr., was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. His mother and her family were Roman Catholics, but his father and his family were white Anglo-Saxon Protestants. The middle name of both father and son commemorate the family's relative President Andrew Jackson. Ong's English family ancestors left East Anglia on the same ship that brought Roger Williams to Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1631. At that time and in earlier centuries, the family name was spelled \\"Onge\\"; it is probably related to the English name \\"Yonge.\\"    In the 1980s, Ong published three remarkably accessible books, each of which is summative in nature, summing up major themes and threads of thought in his extensive body of work:    (1) FIGHTING FOR LIFE: CONTEST, SEXUALITY, AND CONSCIOUSNESS (1981), Ong's 1979 Messenger Lectures at Cornell University;    (2) ORALITY AND LITERACY: THE TECHNOLOGIZING OF THE WORD (1982), which has now gone through more than thirty printings in English and has been translated into eleven other languages;    (3) HOPKINS, THE SELF, AND GOD (1986), Ong's 1981 Alexander Lectures at the University of Toronto.    The late Thomas M. Walsh in English at St. Louis University compiled a bibliography of Ong's extensive body of publications, including bibliographic information about translations and reprintings of his publications. Walsh's bibliography is available online at the website of the Ong Center at St. Louis University. Walsh's bibliography has also been published in a book that he co-edited, CULTURE AND IDENTITY: THE LEGACY OF WALTER J. ONG, S.J. (2011).    In my book WALTER ONG'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO CULTURAL STUDIES: THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE WORD AND I-THOU COMMUNICATION (2000), I have provided a reader's guide to eleven of Ong's books and selected articles, in addition to providing a biographical sketch of his life and scholarly career. The revised edition of my book, which is scheduled to be published in January 2012, will include a new Afterword by me and an updated bibliography.    I have compiled an extensive classified bibliography of selected works that can be related in one way or another to Ong's work that I plan to make available online in the near future at my homepage: [...]. Ten of the categories in my classified bibliography are keyed to specific parts of Ong's book ORALITY AND LITERACY: THE TECHNOLOGIZING OF THE WORD (1982):    (1) works about orality (pages 1-76 in Ong's book);    (2) works about cyclic thought and linear thought (pages 138-144 in Ong's book);    (3) works about agonistic structures (pages 42-45 and 69-70 in Ong's book);    (4) works about writing systems (pages 77-114 in Ong's book);    (5) works about the art of memory (pages 33-36 and 136-152 in Ong's book);    (6) works about commonplaces and composing (pages 107-110 in Ong's book);    (7) works about visuality (pages 115-121 in Ong's book);    (8) works about the inward turn of consciousness (pages 174-176 in Ong's book);    (9) works about the quantification of thought (page 127 in Ong's book);    (10) works about print culture (pages 115-135 in Ong's book).    As Ong explains at greater length elsewhere, he sees the quantification of thought as decisive in the emergence of modern science (e.g., Copernicus and Galileo). In this respect, Ong and Ferguson agree with one another in emphasizing modern science as one significant factor that differentiates the West from the rest of cultures historically down to the present time. For Ong, modern medicine would be a subset of modern science. But Ferguson devotes a separate chapter to discussing modern medicine.    What Ferguson refers to as competition is an aspect of what Ong refers to as agonistic structures and contesting behavior, a topic he discusses at length in several works including FIGHT FOR LIFE: CONTEST, SEXUALITY, AND CONSCIOUSNESS (1981).    For Ong, the rule of law, including laws governing property (which Ferguson discusses), is related to the emergence of phonetic alphabetic writing and written laws. No writing, no written laws.    What Ferguson refers to as consumption is part of the emergence of modern capitalism in what Ong refers to as print culture, which emerged after the emergence of the Gutenberg printing press in the 1450s.    But Ong does not happen to explicitly discuss and thematize work and the work ethic as Ferguson does. However, in his fine preface to the English translation of Hugo Rahner's book MAN AT PLAY (1967, pages ix-xiv), Ong works out an excellent contrast of work with play. Ong's fine preface is reprinted in AN ONG READER: CHALLENGES FOR FURTHER INQUIRY (2002, pages 345-348).    However, Ferguson does not happen to explicitly discuss and thematize certain other factors identified in the above list that Ong discusses not only in his summative book ORALITY AND LITERACY: THE TECHNOLOGIZING OF THE WORD but also in his other books and essays from the early 1950s onward.    For this reason, I would urge readers who are interested in Ferguson's account of the West and the rest to upgrade their thinking by undertaking to read Ong's far more penetrating account of Western cultural history.

0452273331|5.0|This is a great classic where you can discover something new each time you read it, particularly as time passes and you find yourself digging the book out again when in a different phase of your life.  Ayn Rand has a descriptive writing style that I enjoy and don't often see these days.  I am not an proponent of the objectivist philosophy, but I found myself thoroughly engrossed in the protagonist and his passion.  What I remember most poignantly about this story is how I learned to appreciate architecture and space in a different way after reading it.  This book changed my perspective and brings forward issues to analyze as the story progresses; that kind of engagement is makes this book a must-read for everyone's list.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Collins presents engaging, sympathetic characters in untenable, infuriatingly unjust and cruel circumstances. You'll swing between tearing your hair out over the female protagonist's obstinacy and calculating coldness and loving her for her cleverness and valiance in the face of horrific injustice.   Your heart will ache for all those guileless and good, ensnared in an immoral and unwinnable game of politics and power, will rage at the willingly wicked, wasteful and obtuse supporters of such a corrupt and cruel system, and will break for lost innocence, stillborn as a matter of course and murdered if it manages to survive. This book is about the figurative and literal loss of humanity that happens when people choose strategy over compassion, and the struggle-- both on a national and a much smaller, personal scale-- to do what is right, even in the face of overwhelming odds; to survive under terrible circumstances without losing your heart and soul.

B004XE0P5E|1.0|I think I heard this album last year, and it was the greatest, freshest, most innovative thing EVER!<br /><br />I think I heard this album five years ago, and it REDEFINED music.<br /><br />Ten years ago this album came out, man, it was like MUSIC WAS BACK!<br /><br />When this came out twenty years ago, everything changed....<br /><br />Except it is really simple, stomped into the ground-redundant, uninspired boring semi-folk pseudo-indie rock that pretentious white kids have been putting out for years.  Simon & Garfunkel did this too, NO, it did not sound EXACTLY the same (they didn't have a synth, .midi, or an Apple computer) but the sentiment is all the same.<br /><br />Poor me, I'll play my accoustic guitar, sing pathetic lyrics about grovelling in my own petty human-drama and sell it to STUPID KIDS.<br /><br />Lucky me, a hip website told the world I was the best out there -- even though there is SO MUCH out there -- that now I am a superstar, and people think I reinvented the wheel.<br /><br />Right now I am listening to 'The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld'; an album that is twenty years old and is fresher and better than this -- electronic music with tenfold the soul that is Bon Iver's cold porridge. I recommend you purchase 'The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld' instead of Bon Iver by Bon Iver.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I have mentioned before that I love the Harry Potter films and buy every film in DVD when available. Amazon has such great prices that it is considered a \\"no brainer\\" to own.

B001NB1OHI|4.0|My favorite tracks here are the ones that were recorded for \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" but ultimately failed to make the short list for inclusion, \\"Love Comes Tumbling\\" and \\"The Three Sunrises\\".   \\"Love Comes Tumbling\\", a downtempo, moody, slightly atmospheric song with an arpeggiated guitar hook that somehow grabs the ear with aggressive insistence, features Bono in soft, crooning vocal mode with a catchy, wordless, onomatopoetic refrain. Why this couldn't have been included before \\"Promenade\\" on the original release is beyond me; it's definitely more of a song than a a simple ambient sketch of a song. \\"The Three Sunrises\\" is one of the most ecstatic cuts the group has ever recorded, Bono's vocals a joyful invocation, Edge's spare, chiming, heavily processed guitar work rippling up into explosive crescendo, even more on positive message than \\"Pride\\". One reviewer asked why it couldn't have replaced \\"Elvis Presley and America\\" (a track I think was worth including); I think it could have been situated between \\"Bad\\" and \\"Indian Summer Sky\\" as a perfect transitional cut.   \\"Bad\\", utterly transformed in its live setting (though recorded in England, not America), is suggestive of a hopefulness that the version on \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" didn't seem to be able to communicate, and having seen them perform this at Landover, Maryland's Capital Center in 1985, can understand why it's such an integral part of their set list. \\"A Sort Of Homecoming\\" sounds like a sort of a cheat, especially upon the discovery that overdubs contribute the sound of a live audience, but it's programmed over easily enough (though I find the version on \\"Fire\\" to be compelling).   Overall, it's a release that's definitely worth snagging, for long-time fans without access to some of their non-LP/CD singles, rabid completists (who likely have it in their collection already), and neophyte listeners.

B003MC5N28|5.0|This book was a beautiful read. It sucked me in from the beginning. Classic Dystiopian! Well thought out characters, great descriptions, easy to picture this story in my head. A short 188 pages but felt like it contained so many more pages than that.<br /><br />Jonas is worried about what the society with assign him as his job. In this society there is \\"Sameness\\". No color, no difference. A pill is taken to repress sexual feelings birth and death is handled very clinically and very detached. All of society has no feelings and no choices. The society has decided that this is the best way. When Jonas is chose to be the new Receiver, he must receive all of the memories that the society cannot experience. As he does, he awakens to how limiting his society is and a world without love, color, feelings and memories is very plain. For a society who emphasizes the correct use of words, many words have lost their meanings without feelings and memories to define them. Jonas struggles in his position of Receiver and questions the organization of the society. He questions his fathers role as nurturer and his friend as caregiver for the old. Ultimately Jonas make a choice that will impact society and his life and things will have to change.<br /><br />I was sad to reach the end of the book, and it left me having more questions than answers. I am really looking forward to the next book. I hope it will answer my questions.<br /><br />This is more that a YA book. This book is relevant to adults as well. In a society that values \\"Sameness\\" how is there room for individuals and acceptance of those individuals? Our society should pay closer attention to the words between the lines found within this fabulous book! One of my top 5 reads this year!
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|If you approach this film as a conventional movie, then you're bound to be disappointed. It's thin on plot, character development, and other storytelling conventions you expect from a 2-hour movie.  But if you approach it without those expectations, as something different or experimental, this film has great beauty and majesty to offer.  I liken the film to a ballet (or opera), where the set design, music, choreography, and succession of signs and gestures (not all of which are meaningful) combine to produce a dazzling effect.  The kind of ballet would be more Swan Lake than Cirque du Soleil.  (Operative idea here: E. D. Hirsch has argued here [[ASIN:0300016921 Validity in Interpretation]] that we cannot rightly judge a work of art until we know its genre and the conventions that go along with it.)  The soundtrack is phenomenal, perhaps one of its most approachable aspects (being drawn from familiar classical composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Gustav Mahler, Gustav Holst, Hector Berlioz, Henryk Górecki, and John Tavener).  More so than in other films, it serves as the foundation, or the context, for the visual images we see.  I wouldn't at all be surprised to learn that the soundtrack was largely chosen before Malick shot any of the scenes.  I think the analogy here holds up because one of the most common comparisons in reviews has been to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], which featured orchestral music by such composers as Richard Strauss (Also Sprach Zarathustra), Johann Strauss (The Blue Danube Waltz), György Ligeti (various), and Aram Khatchaturian (Gayane Ballet Suite).  The other tangible parallel is the convergence of the scientific (or physical) with the spiritual. In both Malick and Kubrick, we see scenes from evolution, from our prehistoric past. There is no hand of God or suggestion of such. But nearly every present-day scene is imbued with mystery, wonder, and beauty, which allseems pointless if not somehow placed there as a signpost to something beyond itself.  In this Malick is both more explicit and (curiously) more allusive. The film begins with a quotation from the Book of Job. Later, we hear parts of a sermon on Job's sufferings. Characters ask questions in the voice-over such as \\"Who are we to you?\\" the 'you' here clearly meaning God. So, in part, there's an ongoing conversation with God, one that has been going on for centuries (but conspicuously missing from Kubrick's film). In the end, we are asked to take sides.  As the mother sets out in the first few minutes of the Malick film, will we follow \\"the way of nature\\" or the \\"way of grace\\"?  I should add that, even with the generous interpretation above, I was somewhat disappointed by the beach scenes at the end, which seemed like the final episode of Lost. And I have no idea why the Sean Penn scenes were included, unless they provided a kind of metallic and geometric counterbalance to the formless void at the beginning and end of the film.

B00007G207|5.0|... the corniest, sappiest, most sentimental film I've ever liked! Oh yes, if you didn't see it in your neighborhood theater, now closed, when it was released in 1989, you need this warning: It's a shameless tear-jerker! It's also pretty funny at times, especially the scenes inside the theater when the grizzled faces of the Sicilian villagers are awash with tears as they watch those tear-jerker films of yesteryear. There's also a strain of in-house humor about the progression of films that reach the village, from the John Wayne/Clark Gable 'classics' of the 1940s, to Luchino Visconti, and thence to Antonioni, all to the villagers' rowdy miscomprehension ... until TV puts paid to the Big Screen.<br /><br />The story is of a boy in a Sicilian village whose whole life will be in thrall to the cinema, who will become a famous cinema director, and whose Grand Love is essentially a cinema tear-jerker, filmed by moonlight. Films within a film about Film.<br /><br />Did I cry? Hell, no! I don't like sentimental films. I'm a stern stoic Scandinavian sourpuss masquerading as a sweetie-pie. I hate kissie-poo scenes. I can't bear long pensive close-ups of expressive faces. Flashbacks to childhood give me the creeps. Nostalgia is anathema to a red-nosed cowpoke like me ...<br /><br />... but I loved Cinema Paradiso. I wasn't alone. Everybody did.

B0063B2BRU|5.0|This refreshingly *different* season of Bones is gearing up to be one of the series' best! It is just the reinvigoration the show needed!   Life has changed at the Jeffersonian since we last saw our favorite crime-solvers. After last season's pregnancy bombshell of an ender, we pick up with forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan entering her third trimester, hormones all over the place as she bumbles in that adorable way that only Brennan can into the frightening role of motherhood. As always, her partner FBI Agent Seeley Booth is there by her side, more loving and more happy than we've ever seen him. Having them together romantically (FINALLY), is a joy I'm still unable to get over :) It feels... natural. It almost makes you wonder, why wasn't it always this way? (Also makes you forget the angsty love triangle of season 6 ever even happened! Hannah who? ;p)   I think David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel slipped into this new relationship quite easily. What's great is that not a lot has changed, and yet, EVERYTHING has. They live together, they're planning on buying a house, they kiss and cuddle on the couch and Booth croons to Brennan's belly in the cutest baby voice you will ever hear... and yet, they're still \\"Booth and Bones\\". They still solve murders. They still bicker good-naturedly over everything under the sun. They banter. They get overprotective. They make mistakes- and own up to them after. They're like any new couple expecting a child. But are they normal? Far from it, because at its core, Bones is still the same show: a journey of love between two very different people... one a woman who views the world through utmost rationalism and who is still learning how to open her heart; the other a man who relies on instincts and gut feeling to do his job, and who lets faith and emotion drive his personal life. Both coming from traumatic pasts and both craving a new beginning (\\"New memories, new life\\", as Brennan aptly puts it in episode 1) for this new family they've created. And that unchanging dynamic, coupled with a deep satisfaction after six years of will-they won't-they, is what has made this season so very interesting!  That, and the other characters are still as charming and as \\"comedic gold\\" as ever. Hodgins and Angela's baby situation juxtaposes nicely with Booth and Brennan's (I'm eager to see Baby Michael and Baby Girl Brennan-Booth growing up together), Cam struggles with keeping the workplace professional, there's a new intern, a new recurring villain, and other familiar faces return! Plus, I have it on good word that the birth of Booth and Brennan's baby WILL. BE. EPIC. Ahhhh!   So yeah. It's funny. It's emotional. It's unexpected. I highly recommend season 7 of Bones! (There's no such thing as a 'Moonlighting Curse'! Bones has proven it WRONG! :D)
B005PK56TA|5.0|I started watching this show because my friend had started to TIVO it. I was not interested because I figured it was the typical TV not horror show. Now I am a huge fan of David Lynch's 1977 classic \\"Eraser Head,\\" a truly disturbed film. \\"Eraser Head\\" is in black and white. \\"American Horror Story\\" is, in my opinion, equally disturbed in color - a great achievement. I will be the first to admit that the Halloween episodes left me wanting. Now I should say that I only saw the Pilot show at my friend's house and figured I had time to catch up with the remaining stories. Lo and behold, something went wrong with her dish and the technician had to wipe out her stored episodes. That send me scrambling. I was able to pick up with episode 4 on my own cable network and just paid Amazon $1.99 each for 2 & 3. I would have paid more. I am now up to date. Except for the Halloween episodes, every other episode smacks you upside the head, like \\"Where did that come from?\\" Or I didn't see that coming! Sometimes it's just \\"Damn!\\" The writing is just short of brilliant.<br /><br />I love disturbed. This show is so close to my heart I am beginning to think they wrote it just for me.

They still solve murders. They still bicker good-naturedly over everything under the sun. They banter. They get overprotective. They make mistakes- and own up to them after. They're like any new couple expecting a child. But are they normal? Far from it, because at its core, Bones is still the same show: a journey of love between two very different people... one a woman who views the world through utmost rationalism and who is still learning how to open her heart; the other a man who relies on instincts and gut feeling to do his job, and who lets faith and emotion drive his personal life. Both coming from traumatic pasts and both craving a new beginning (\\"New memories, new life\\", as Brennan aptly puts it in episode 1) for this newfamily they've created. And that unchanging dynamic, coupled with a deep satisfaction after six years of will-they won't-they, is what has made this season so very interesting!  That, and the other characters are still as charming and as \\"comedic gold\\" as ever. Hodgins and Angela's baby situation juxtaposes nicely with Booth and Brennan's (I'm eager to see Baby Michael and Baby Girl Brennan-Booth growing up together), Cam struggles with keeping the workplace professional, there's a new intern, a new recurring villain, and other familiar faces return! Plus, I have it on good word that the birth of Booth and Brennan's baby WILL. BE. EPIC. Ahhhh!   So yeah. It's funny. It's emotional. It's unexpected. I highly recommend season 7 of Bones! (There's no such thing as a 'Moonlighting Curse'! Bones has proven it WRONG! :D)

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|As far as the movie is concerned I love it. The digital copy is not a digital copy at all. You still have to stream it to any device you want to watch it from. Ultra violet is a complete rip off. If I'm on a plane, in airplane mode on my iPhone, I can't stream it to my phone because there is no signal. This is a shame, Ultra Violet does not need to be recognized as a digital copy of a movie. So disappointed.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I don't get to watch much TV so normally for me I find DVD sets at Amazon or at a store. Usually I have no idea where or not the shows I buy will be good or not.  If you're wondering the same thing about Fringe then fear not - this is a great show!  I agree with other reviewers that the first few shows could be better but then they found their feet and tore off running.  I love all the characters and I'm well entertained and you will be too!

Asher has created an incredible story of the ripple effect individuals can unknowingly have on another person's life.
0553386794|3.0|I give this book three stars only because I finished it. That said, I finished it only to see what the hype is all about. For me, the book fell flat. The plot was tiring and predictable. The character voices were not different enough to pull off the many points of view. In short, I never really cared about this story.<br /><br />I also listened to part of this book on audio, and that did help get me over the middle hump. The narrator's voice breathed a little more life into the characters, and I am curious to see if the actors in the mini-series do the same. Through it all, I kept thinking that it would make a better movie than book.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I am completely satisfied with my purchase of the Gilmore Girls Complete Series.  I purchased it as a gift for my wife, who already has the complete series.  I wanted to buy this product based on the package design.  Anyone who owns any of the individual seasons of the Gilmore Girls will know they fall apart.  That makes it real hard for her to keep track of all the discs, since they fall out.  And they also keep getting scratched.    So, I bought this...  [[ASIN:B000U0F7RG Gilmore Girls: The Complete Series Collection]]  The product is exactly what I expected.  The case is made well enough to last a while.  The folders containing the individual seasons are basic, but perfect for someone who watches this series from beginning to end and back again, and again, and again.  I am totally satisfied with my purchase.  Now, I just need to buy a 72 capacity CD/DVD case for all the old ones.

B005VR9328|3.0|The Roots are a talented band and yet just never ever brought the goods on a whole.  they tend to be better suited to backing up a more established act and they don't have anybody in there band that demands that kind of \\"IT\\" that says we are a force to be reckon with. this album reminds of the past few ones and doesn't really go anywhere.  truth is  the Roots are missing  a  Siner  who  can  take  what they  do places. imagine Tower of Power without  Rick Stevens and especially without Lenny Williams and just go there after and you see what the roots have settled for.  the Roots need a lead singer and somebody you wouldn't normally associate with there stuff. if they had the Hailey brothers KC and Jo-Jo or a Tevin Campbell, or a Usher singing there  stuff it would do wonders.  they are better musicians with time, however  they aren't trying to get anywhere with there writing.  they were more interesting to me from 95-98. truth is the late night gig when they team up with fill in the blank act is where they shine far more. nothing on there records matches that kind of  vibe. they don't make  bad or wack albums, they just don't make  very Good or Great ones either. and there problem  is they lack songs that truly stand out. being around a long time is a great accomplishement and the whole Neo Soul movement and artists clique, but then you need to have a song or two that best represents that. its one thing to respect and admire a Band like Fishbone, but to be Hitless and not have a signature song like them is  not how you want to be compared with.
1419702238|4.0|My son was really happy with this book. He was waiting for its release for months!  The delivery was super fast, with the Amazon prime we got it in two days. The only reason I gave it 4 Stars is because I think the book is too short. He finished it the same day it arrived.
B0059XTUEK|5.0|First off, I'm a movie lover, but not really much of a critic.  My critiques of films rely almost solely upon how entertained I was.  I believe I have an eye for what is good on-screen, although I can't really pick things apart to discern if a thing was off, such as the direction.  That being said, I could not have been more captivated watching Michelle Williams portrayal of the different facets of the iconic Marilyn Monroe.  It's not really that she looks like her--I don't really think that she does--but more that she embodies the role with such grace and nuance as to shed light on Marilyn's evolving personalities so unselfconsciously that one suspends disbelief while watching her play the seductive temptress, the insecure woman-child, and the lonely and lost soul who's reaching out for anyone or anything that might save her.  She does all this with humor, candor, honesty, and most importantly, immense compassion and empathy for her subject.  Michelle's performance made me look again at Marilyn, an endeavor I started with the stunning release last year of the collection of her writings, \\"Fragments\\".<br /><br />The supporting cast here is amazing.  Kenneth Branagh as Olivier is a revelation.  Again, I could not have imagined him in that role, but he is absolute perfection as Olivier.  Judi Dench brings her usual emotional weight and sweetness to her portrayal of Dame Sybil Thorndike, and Eddie Redmayne is pitch perfect as the besotted Colin, who wrote the book detailing his time with MM.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good about this movie.  For people fascinated with movies, Marilyn, or just the trappings of the human heart, this movie is a wonder.  Michelle Williams is the main reason.  I found that, as with Monroe, one's eyes stay glued to her in every frame in which she appears--in fact, I actually missed her when she was not on the screen.  She gives a star-making performance that may well garner her the Oscar, in my estimation.  It will certainly be a game changer for her pick of roles...she'll never be seen the same way again after the due she's paid Marilyn in this wonderful treat of a movie.nger for her pick of roles...she'll never be seen the same way again after the due she's paid Marilyn in this wonderful treat of a movie.

B0051T46XM|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am not a fan of 'mockumentaries'. I did not enjoy the Blair Witches or The Last Broadcast. District 9 worked for me because it was able to weave itself in and out of the formula. Troll Hunter sticks to the forumala pretty tightly and I first couldn't put my finger on why this movie not only appealed to me but attracted me to watch it 4 times in two days. I have since viewed Troll Hunter about 20 more times and I have figured it out. The movie just 'WORKS'! It works on all levels...believability, ambiance, lore, everything. The characters are well fleshed out and the scenery is majestic. But what really sells the movie are the Trolls themselves and I really wish this film were popular enough where Sideshow Toys or McFarlane would make figures of them. They're loveable yet menacing and well done considering this movie was not made on a Jurassic Park budget (even shows like Terra Nova do not have the level of quality CG Troll Hunter has).   But effects are nothing without a compelling story and this is such a compelling story that everything that does not work for me in mockumentaries works here!  If you're reading I'm sure your interest is already entertained so please see this movie and tell friend... I want my Troll Hunter action figures!  if this was helpful please respond to tenseicoalition@gmail.com
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Our small fry has her own drums, tambourine,and \\"echo\\" microphone. Boy do those puppies get a workout when she watches Rio. If she's not dancing across our living room floor to the stellar music or singing at the top of her lungs when the chorus comes on, she's mesmerized by Blue & Jewels. Good addition to our collection. Oh, and Will-I-Am is HILARIOUS! Our favorite character by far!
B0061S073A|4.0|I purchased a kindle fire for a christmas gift for my young child.  I was horrified when I found out after the purchase that there were no parental controls onboard the device. Unwanted purchases and unlimited webserfing were inevitable. I believe amazon is working on a software update to correct this.  This app will only be a short term fix for me till that software is in place.  It allows you to only allow access to \\"Kids Place\\" where you can load apps that you feel are appropriate.  Make sure you also lock your kindle fire. When the fire is powered off, if the fire is not locked it will revert back to your normal home screen.  When locked you will have to enter a pin that you have set up.  The down side to this type of setup is that when in kids place the user has no access to the cloud.  I have set up music in the cloud for my child and they will not have access to this when in this mode.  Hopefully Amazon gets it right and my child will have access to the things that I purchased the kindle fire for.
B001DTUU7A|5.0|If your small fry enjoys watching the same flick over and over and over and....well you get the point. This movie is one that never gets old. The colors are brilliant on Blu-ray, and our daughter is crazy for Horton. Great find, and welcome addition to the animated library.
B002STRAHW|5.0|I like all of the songs on this album. Well, almost all. The only exception just happens to be: The Only Exception. Some of the songs took longer for me to enjoy and want to listen to (Misguided Ghosts), but this album ended up better than Riot!, which I am going to buy the rest of today.
B0051OJG4Q|5.0|Do yourself a big favor and don't pay much attention to the above two negative reviews of this excellent set I bought from Amazon. As for the second review, it's too bad a defective set was received but that can happen with any purchased set. All four of my CDs play fine. The set has 8 albums well dubbed from vinyl. Sure, you'll hear a few crackles on no more than a couple of songs. The majority of these CDs sound great and you can test them yourself by listening to them right here. If you don't like the sound, don't buy the set.
B001RCD2DW|4.0|I'd highly recommend these for acoustic music, soft rock, classical, and pure vocals. The bass on these is too lacking to fully enjoy bass heavy music such as heavy metal or hip hop. Some equalization can compensate for this deficiency, but I feel that this should not be necessary for a pair of headphones in this price range and that is why I knocked the rating down 1 star.    The earcups are super comfortable with a velour-like surface. The cups don't touch your ears at all and all the pressure is applied to the sides of your head, so unless you have very large ears, you can wear these for an extended period of time without worrying about your ears hurting or sweating. The thickness of these cups keep a little bit of distance between your ears and the drivers. This along with the open construction really helps open up the soundstage. This will give it more of open-ended sound compared to enclosed headphones that try to jam the speaker right next to your ear. It feels more like the band is playing in your room, rather than a band is plaing inside your head as is the case with many closed-ear headphones. The padding on the cups could be a tad softer though, as they're a bit on the stiff side.    There are some people that complain about the bumps on the underside of the headband but I honestly don't notice them when i put these headphones on. I doubt most people would notice them as if they have a full head of hair. Also, another common complaint is their plastic construction. Like most AKG headphones, they are designed this way in order to be very flexible, light, and self-adjustable. This type of design would not be possible with the use of metal parts. Unless these were sat on, I don't feel that its construction would yield any durability problems.    Also, I dig the detacheable cable, though I feel that the cable could be a bit thicker. If you want to check out more on these headphones, I recommend go to Youtube and type in \\"How It's Made Headphones\\". Very interesting stuff.    *UPDATE* the elastic bands on these things wore out and now it no longer retracts the cups back. Apparently, this is a common problem with these phones. If I had to do it again, I would probably for for the improved and cheaper K7xx Massdrop version.

B005KMX866|4.0|\\"Beyond The Sun\\" is an interesting conundrum. I typically dislike cover albums because the originals are always better with few exceptions. In this case, Isaak makes it clear he wants to cover songs from Sun Records and beyond. Well, with many songs coming from Elvis Presley I wondered why he just didn't do an album of Presley covers? It's obvious he has the voice and that he idolizes Presley, so why only go halfway? The other thought I had was why stick with Sun Records? Why not do covers by a more diverse group of artists like most singers do? At any rate, it's no secret that Isaak loves these songs, and this album is all Isaak whether you appreciate it or not.<br /><br />I also thought about the fact that Isaak could have added interest in this album if he had covered other artists from the same era. For example, where's Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Little Richard, The Everly Brothers, Bo Diddley, Ray Charles, Ritchie Valens, Bill Haley and His Comets, Tennessee Ernie Ford or even The Beach Boys, something produced by Phil Spector, Del Shannon, Eddie Cochran, Rick Nelson, etc.<br /><br />Strangely, I enjoyed Isaak's perfectionist take on some old classics and some lesser known tracks. He perfectly recreates that 50's sound, almost as if Presley and Orbison had been reincarnated. Sure, I agree that Isaak doesn't warp the songs into something very different from the originals. So, I understand how several people are indifferent and disappointed with Isaak's approach. However, I also agree with the rave reviewers that compliment Isaak's vocals and dedication to recreating the songs with an up-to-date production. It's not five stars, but certainly not one or two either. I give it three and a half stars because I found the 25 tracks to be more enjoyable than boring run-through. There's something intangible about Isaak that no other artist today has. Isaak can do what 10 years of American Idol contestants continually fail to do--put some life in these old songs!<br /><br />It's a fine stop-gap between regular Isaak albums. I do agree that the two discs would have fit on one disc, and that's how it should have been done. Also, at 25 tracks (2 originals by Isaak), it could have been trimmed down, or better yet, he could have selected from a wider array of musicians to cover and not just stuck to Sun Records.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Beyond The Sun\\" compares with Isaak's previous works:<br /><br />1985 Silvertone: Four Stars<br />1987 Chris Isaak: Four Stars<br />1989 Heart Shaped World: Four Stars<br />1993 San Francisco Days: Four and a Half Stars<br />1995 Forever Blue: Five Stars<br />1996 Baja Sessions: Three Stars<br />1998 Speak of the Devil: Three Stars<br />2002 Always Got Tonight: Three Stars<br />2004 Christmas: Three Stars<br />2006 Best of: Three Stars<br />2009 Mr. Lucky: Four Stars<br />2011 Beyond The Sun: Three and a Half Starsregular Isaak albums.

B005O64VH8|2.0|I agree completely with the reviewer who regards Winter Poem as \\"formulaic and predictable.\\"  It is as if there is an inverse correlation between Secret Garden's fame and their unique magic. As the one rises ...... the other falls.  It isn't that the album is bad ..... never that ..... but it is ordinary in the overall.  Here and there one can almost find a trace of what once was a special creative quality, but it dissolves into ...... sameness.  To me Secret Garden is now too successful, almost corporate, and the magic has died.
B005ELQVGW|3.0|Let me just add my two cents here by saying that Bjork is the only Icelandic music artist I have in my vast music collection. She has proven time and again that she is unique and original. I trust her instincts as an artist whether she makes gold or trash. \\"Biophilia\\" is neither gold or trash. It is cosmic and scientific, a theme Bjork has not really covered on her previous works.<br /><br />For me, I have to allow Bjork's music to just wash over me because any other approach I would take would interfere with my ability to listen objectively. Bjork is a polarizing artist. She isn't a great singer, but she sure has had some great vocal moments throughout her career. She can be grating if you focus on her singing too much. She can also be so esoteric that she can come off simple-minded if you dwell on her lyrics, as she tends to almost chant certain refrains and words over and over.<br /><br />To me, Bjork peaked a decade ago with \\"Vespertine\\" and has slowly wilted like an exotic flower that's lived past its allotted time. \\"Biophilia\\" is uneven, but it still manages some interesting effects and melodies. Repeatedly listening to \\"Biophilia\\" reveals its strengths. What at first sounds like noise and discord gives way to patterns and rhythms. So, there are two beautiful gems here in the form of \\"Virus\\", which is one of the best songs Bjork as done in some time, and to a slightly lesser extent, \\"Cosmogony\\". There are some switch-hitters here like first single, \\"Crystalline\\" with it's drum and bass breakdown during its final minutes. The same occurs with \\"Mutual Core\\" and \\"Sacrifice\\" and even the bonus track \\"Nattura\\"--all of which keeps things interesting. \\"Thunderbolt\\" and \\"Solstice\\" are also well done.<br /><br />Still, the album suffers from the same problem \\"Volta\\" suffered from which is, despite its lyrical themes, the music is uneven, the execution boring at times. \\"Dark Matter\\" is very dull, and \\"Moon\\" is only slightly better. \\"Hollow\\" sounds like a child banging on keys for the first time. These are speed bumps that detract from the overall experience. The different versions of \\"Hollow\\" and \\"Dark Matter\\" don't help either. They just prolong the album. After the first few listens I skipped over these to \\"Nattura\\" and the album felt better.<br /><br />I am still a fan of Bjork, and I will still continue to buy her music, because, like I said earlier, she IS original and challenging, and that's something I look for in pop music, and she is also the only Icelandic artist that immediately comes to mind, just like a-ha is the only Norwegian artist that comes to mind when thinking Norway (and they were also very original and unique). However, to be critical, Bjork has strayed musically. She has made much better albums than this. Some reviewer remarked negatively that Bjork's next album will probably be just her singing. Um, she already did that on \\"Medulla\\". Where were you? I listened to each Bjork album in sequential order prior to listening to \\"Biophilia\\" so that I could give as accurate a rating as I possibly could. So here goes: Here's how \\"Biophilia\\" compares to Bjork's previous works:<br /><br />The Sugarcubes:<br /><br />1988 Life's Too Good: Four Stars<br />1989 Here Today Tomorrow: Three Stars<br />1992 Stick Around For Joy: Three and a Half Stars<br /><br />Bjork:<br /><br />1993 Debut: Three Stars<br />1995 Post: Five Stars<br />1997 Homogenic: Five Stars<br />2000 Selmasongs: Three Stars<br />2001 Vespertine: Four Stars<br />2004 Medulla: Two and a Half Stars<br />2007 Volta: Three and a Half Stars<br />2011 Biophilia: Three and a Half Starsse are speed bumps that detract from the overall experience.

0062101897|5.0|Excellent book!  I bought two and gave one to another Harry Potter addict.  They loved it.  Was told about this book by another friend who was thrilled with it.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|The first three books are long, but have many things going on and are full of surprises.  The last two books (4 and 5 (dance w dragons), I wish I could un-read.  So many, many untied loose ends that it was almost comical.  I had high hopes for the conclusion, and I just have to say that it was a big let down.  That being said, getting to book three is a great ride.  Then maybe just let yourself imagine what happens (I promise you will imagine better than the last 2 books).   Also, find a pdf somewhere on the web with all the families / characters.  It is helpful as you are reading..

That world and every small detail of it lasted 600 pages, but no more and no longer. I take this time to reassess reality and draw that arbitrary line between what is real and what is fantasy. The best fiction transports you and may even take a person longer to come back to center.  Critics consider East of Eden one of Steinbeck's most ambitious novels. Admittedly, when I first picked it up, this critic called Steinbeck a little pretentious for scribing the 600 pages set before me. I stand corrected. I have yet to read a novel that was so closely connected to the psychology of humanity and aware of good and evil in such a deep and comprehensive way. This was not revealed through the storyline that was forced onto the characters, but through the descriptions of the characters and their careful dialogue.  I was most fascinated by two characters in this novel: Catherine and Cal. Catherine, also went by Cathy or Kate in parts of the novel. Catherine was evil incarnate. As her name changed and she established a new identity, her evil changed shape as well. Catherine's soulless demeanor is best described by the narrator, \\"Her self was an island\\" (157). While some critics consider her the most fascinating Steinbeck character, I find Cal far more complex. Cal thinks he is evil; he struggles with his desires and believes he has no good in him. He discovers he is the offspring of a despicable woman and finds confirmation in what he's always known by instinct: he's got bad blood. What I find most fascinating is the way he hurts his brother, Aron. He hurts his brother by telling him the truth. I champion honesty in all circumstances and find this quality in a person or a character to be one of the highest possible virtues. This is not what is considered valuable to the Trask family nor the author. After the truth is revealed, death follows on multiple fronts. The cause and effect of the plot suggests that physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual deaths are a consequence of truth. This is deeply unsettling insight into a culture that is more concerned with the appearance of good than the reality of evil.
B005J29HCQ|4.0|I must give the Beach Boys some credit for turning in the assignment more than 40 years after the due date, however this was kind of like turning in the library book forty plus years after the due date. This was the most anticipated lost work in Rock and Roll History. It was a superb effort by a faction of the Band who wanted to put the Car and Surf tunes in the rear-view mirror. Unlike the Beatles who were welcomed into the Psychedelic Genre, The Beach Boys were so pigeonholed as a surf group that they were not allowed to let their creative juices flow in this genre. This was a concept album that didn't quite finish the race to get there first. The Beatles won the race with \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".   When looking at the Sessions release you should compare it with Smiley Smile and Brian Wilson's solo effort, which is the finished product in the Smile Saga. SMiLE at it's core had some solid singles in it's lineup. Smile was more focused than Smiley Smile which was gutted of some solid material. Smiley Smile was light on focus and too top heavy on psychedelic substances. It was a hollowed out SMiLE.  It was the failure of Smiley Smile and the loss of Brian Wilson that stalled their success as relevant act in the classic rock genre until they resurfaced as a retro band with the success of Endless Summer.  Brian Wilson's solo effort must be graded on a curve, because he could not replicate his windpipes for his solo project. It gives you a taste of the original 1967 model, however he had to finish the product outside of the parameters of 1967 which is like adding bondo putty to a classic car.  I give the Sessions release four stars in it's unfinished format. Had the assignment been completed on schedule, it would have been a good follow up to Pet Sounds. It would have never challenged Sgt Pepper for the lead car in the  psychedelic race. Had SMiLE not crashed on the race to get there first with the Beatles, the Beach Boys would not had the deadman's curve moment intheir musical long promised road which had many hills and valleys. This release was worth the wait but released outside of it's psychedelic element.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|This movie takes far greater a beating than it should. In a market where sequels, adaptations, and remakes rule, a veritable effort at a fresh concept should be praised just for existing. Not to say that it's a great flick or anything, believe me, but it's far from being the disaster so many describe it as.
B0050QV0RQ|1.0|I cannot get the app to work on my kindle fire. the intro screen does not respond to any touch. I want my money back please.
B0064J6OMO|3.0|I really wanted to see this movie because the Trailer looked amazing. My favorite actor, Jason Bateman, was in it. And, I really enjoyed Horrible Bosses. HB got a horrible review on Amazon, but I found it really funny-- so when I read that this movie also had terrible reviews, I just ignored it and paid $4 to see it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Trailer was a lot different than the actual movie. They really should hire whomever the guy is that makes the trailers to make a movie! I wish I paid more attention to the reviews. THe Change-Up was excessively raunchy.  It would be funny to people who like that kind of humor.  I, myself, find it amusing in small doses and when it's well timed.  The raunchiness here was just over the top though.<br /><br />I think that might be a reason why this movie didn't make much money. It actually was a financial loss, according to Wiki.  According to IMDB, it is only a 6.5/10.  It had some funny moments, but most of the punchline was captured in the trailer.  There was a lot of cursing and swearing.  There were a lot of vulgar jokes.<br /><br />It was like they took the Disney movie, where people switch places, but fraternized it. There was a LOT of nudity. It was just randomly placed. Some scenes which were meant to be funny-- struck me as more grotesque.  It looks like the producers were going for shock factor.  If you like movies, like Weather Man or Elf, maybe you would like this.  It is more in the style of Will Farrell humor.<br /><br />This is nothing like Horrible Bosses or other work that Jason Bateman usually does.  Just so you know- before you purchase....
B004HO6I2E|1.0|This movie was such a disappointment.  With Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman it should have been a no brainer to check out.  I was wrong.  Lame over used jokes and crappy acting.  Just because The Hang over and Bridesmaids have made the R rated comedy come back, they had a good story line.  This was a waste of time.....

B0002HYC8C|1.0|Let me start by saying I have not assembled this toy nor have I given it to my grandson yet.  That being said, I ordered it because of all the wonderful reviews.  Maybe the toy will be fun after assembly, but there should have been SOME indication that the ark comes in a HUGE box filled with many rattling pieces.  I fear that my son will not even be able to fit this into his car to take home after Christmas.  The parents will probably want me to keep the toy here because it's got so many small pieces.
B005ZCXFD2|4.0|The best types of films are the ones that unexpectedly deliver.  I saw the preview for this movie and I thought it was going to be a next-gen Monster Squad.  Light-hearted, kids killing monsters romp.  It's more like Monster Squad meets Misfits meets The Wire.  Loved it.

In general it can also cause this conspiracy theory awakening in readers but if you apply it in moderation and start looking at the things from a different angle, it won't do you any harm. Strongly recommended.
1932100660|2.0|This book encouraged me to revert to fundamental learnings on what to eat and how to live. I believe we must first seek out and recognize what our Creator has designed for us to sustain life, then look to information that has been available to us for centuries. Read the words of God, Hippocrates, Airola or Gerson for reliable facts and guidance in the field of nutrition and health. I will add though... I think atleast one of the authors was in the documentary \\"Forks Over Knives\\" which was worth watching. I enjoyed seeing people overcome afflictions:)

B004EPYZP8|4.0|Based on a novel by Michael Connelly, who incidentally seemed pleased with the adaption. A cynical yet very competent lawyer takes on the case of an \\"innocent man\\" and finds himself in for a number of surprises. Matthew McConaughey gives a stellar performance and is well suited for the role. His acting is truly one of the highlights for this film and a few of the dialogues sparkled. There's a good cast here, too, and while the elements of this thriller didn't floor me it was pretty good. The budget for this film was $40M and it yielded a bit over $85M at the Box Office. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B  LEGAL THRILLER QUALITY: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid December 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.

B005DTEUAE|4.0|It's been a while since the world has heard from the Red Hot Chili Peppers- five years, to be exact. The last studio album they recorded was 2006's \\"Stadium Arcadium\\". Since the long break, they have been busy with other things- notably drummer Chad Smith doing his solo album as well as joining the supergroup Chickenfoot fronted by former Van Halen members Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony. Flea studied music theory classes (!?!?) at the University Of Southern California, while John Fruisciante recorded another solo album...and split from the band for the second time in almost fifteen years. When the remaining Chili Peppers reunited, they found a replacement in newcomer Josh Klinghoffer, who was the backup guitarist on their tour. They released their first album in five years \\"I'm With You\\"- which was produced by Rick Rubin, who has worked with the band for 20 years since their Warner Bros. debut- the multi-platinum \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\".<br /><br />On this new album, it's pretty much business as usual with the Chili Peppers. They start the album with the disco influenced track \\"Monarchy Of Roses\\" and leading into the funky \\"Factory Of Faith\\". The first single \\"The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie\\" is driven by Flea's strong bassline and sounds like their early 90's output. They employ an influence of Latin rhythms on the song \\"Did I Let You Know\\" and get somber on the untimely death themed \\"Brendan's Death Song\\". The funky \\"Ethiopia\\" has rather simplistic but catchy verses and a harmony laden chorus. They sing of a lonely woman who's desperate to become a mother on \\"Annie Wants A Baby\\" and make use of their signature sound on \\"Look Around\\". While \\"I'm With You\\" is not their best record, it is still a solid showing from the Red Hot Chili Peppers after almost 30 years in the business. Sonically the vinyl version of \\"I'm With You\\" is halfway decent in the mastering aspect, however it's a tad bit on the expensive side. Overall, the Chili Peppers still have what it takes to do the music they are known for and continue to show they still have what it takes.e music they are known for and continue to show they still have what it takes.
B005XY67WI|5.0|The energy of the concert was amazing. Shakira seems to be really graceful and amazes me that she spoke French. I wonder how many languages she knows? Well she is amazing at her dancing and she is very sexy. I loved that the concert was very rock-theme plus you can hear some techno mix in it. I thought the BlueRay was very great at capturing the image and sound. A bit of odd slow motion editing but I got use to it since there isn't really that much. I only wish they showed more behind the scene in the Extra material but the main part. The concert, was beautiful and it looks and sounds great. Good performance.
B004H1T9W8|1.0|This version, like many cheaper versions, jumps right into the sonnets with no introduction nor table of contents. As best I can tell, it IS one of the cheaper versions, with no attempt at formatting and no real added value. Yet it's priced the same as the Oxford version which has a lengthy introduction (and introductions to each work), an active table of contents, and better formatting (about as good as you can find on the Kindle).<br /><br />If you want to spend $28 for the complete Shakespeare, buy the Oxford. If you want a stripped-down, bare-bones Shakespeare, look at one of the $1.99 or $2.99 versions. Or maybe look for a free version on Guttenberg.
B006FLGBGA|5.0|Whichever movie executive had the idea to make Rise of the Planet of the Apes available to buy for $14.99 before it was available to rent at $3.99/$4.99 made a serious miscalculation.  The movie is available, which stirs up interest in seeing it.  Most people are unwilling to pay $14.99 to see it.  They are unable to rent it.  Instead they go to a website and watch it for free.  People that would have been perfectly content paying you $4.99 now pay you $0.00. I'm giving a 5-star review because this is not a critique of the film but rather of a quite silly business decision that the studio made.

B002C6A6FY|5.0|This is almost always on the list of \\"best films of all time\\", and I won't say anything to contradict that. Even if you don't especially like this film for one reason or another, it is a must see. There are so many classic lines from it, which are used in other movies, TV shows, even by comedians (though the lines were not originally comic in nature), that you should know them. How many times have you heard \\"Here's lookin' at you, kid\\" ?  or \\"Play it again, Sam\\" ? (not the exact words Bogart used, but that is the way they have become popularized). All in all, this is a must see film. That said, in my humble opinion TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT was a better Bogart movie, and it is also a classic, but CASABLANCA is right up there with the best of them!

B006FS22Y8|5.0|I became an Amy Winehouse fan back in 2007, after she became a Grammy nominee. After hearing about all the Grammy nominations she'd received I decided to purchase \\"Back to Black\\" and was floored by her powerhouse vocals. Amy continues to deliver on \\"Lioness: Hidden Treasures\\". As with \\"Back to Black\\" I can listen to every track on the cd. My favorites on Lioness are \\"Our day will come\\", Between the cheats, Valerie, which is a re-release, Like Smoke,with guest rap by Nas, who has more air-time on the track than Amy, \\"The Girl from Ipanema, you will like this if you know what scat-singing is, (think Ella Fitzgerald. I also like this version of \\"Wake up alone on this cd, it has a more acoustic feel. All in all, I like this cd as much as \\"Back to Black\\". If you are an Amy Winehouse fan you will want to purchase this album, if you aren't it is still worth a listen. In an age where truly gifted singers are few and far between, Amy was the exception. RIP Dear Amy!

B0050XFY4O|3.0|Once I accounted for my moderately deficient attention, my rating for this film went from 2 stars to three. IT'S PACED SO SLOW.<br /><br />At times, it's like viewing a painting or sculpture but without all the complexity found in those media. There ARE actors as young as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and more seasoned actors like Giancarlo Esposito and Maggie Smith who can advance and build upon the complexity of the narrative using subtle gestures (often, \\"repressed\\" gestures) alone. Rafael Cardoso and João Gabriel Vasconcellos, while skillful, are not able to produce the kinds of performances that a lingering camera needs. Further impeding the flow are several extended musical - vignettes that contribute to the film's mood but to little else.<br /><br />The childhood portion, an almost perfectly performed and paced act, is necessary to make the two adult actors with their extremely dissimilar appearances seem like brothers. I have a half brother (who I've never schtooped) and no one believes he and I are related at all unless they have known us since childhood. Taking so much time to show Fancisco and Tom&aacute;s as children help to make their romance as adults viscerally disturbing.<br /><br />That said, the performances from Cardoso and Vasconcellos are quite strong and would have had more effect with tighter editing and time constraints. At a little more than 90 minutes in length, the film and its characters tend to feel unnatural (never mind the incest) when, at a streamlined 70 minutes with more dialogue, it could have been, while still disturbing, sweet and seductive.<br /><br />One last thing: It was nice to watch a Brazilian film and understand almost all of the dialog. My Portuguese is low-intermediate at best and I usually need subtitles to follow the dialects of the southeast. Cariocas sound like they have teeth missing when they pronounce any word with an \\"s\\". lol

B005G4TJI4|1.0|Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague.
B005SAZFWK|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  If you're a fan of quirky indie films such as 'Harold and Maude' or anything by quirky indie director Wes Anderson, then first-time director Richard Ayoade's 'Submarine' is for you. As for the rest of us, better to find something more rooted in a sensible, historical reality. This is not to say that Mr. Ayoade is not without talent. His background is in music video as well as being well known for his comic performance on a British TV show, 'The IT Crowd'. Ayoade does wonders with the camera, turning his Welsh urban landscape into a veritable palette of most inviting sights and sounds.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, Ayoade drew his inspiration from the 2008 novel of the same name, by Joe Dunthorne. While I haven't read the novel, I'm told that the film sticks fairly closely to the novel's plot, which features the unlikeable protagonist, Oliver Tate (played by Craig Roberts, who bears a striking resemblance to another famous quirky character, Bud Cort, of 'Harold and Maude' fame). Roberts has Oliver offering up an almost deadpan, monosyllabic delivery throughout the film, which some may find to be cool or amusing, but for me it's symptomatic of Submarine's overall monotonous tone.<br /><br />  Submarine's main problem is that it's protagonist, Oliver, is not endearing at all. Most 'coming-of-age' stories feature protagonists who are basically good people with one characteristic flaw. In Oliver's case, it's the opposite: most of his actions are cruel and he fails to have his grand epiphany until the film's denouement.<br /><br />  Set in the mid-80s in Wales, we're introduced to Oliver as he's fantasizing what his community's response would be, had he passed away at his current age of fifteen. If that isn't morbid enough, it gets worse when Oliver decides to impress Jordana, a schoolmate he has a crush on, by bullying another overweight schoolmate, Zoe, who ends up falling into a pond as a result of Oliver's taunts. To make matters worse, Oliver types up a manual for Zoe, advising her how not to be a victim and delivers it to her only friend, only to discover that Zoe has left school and moved as a result of all the bullying.<br /><br />  Oliver and Jordana become victims of bullying themselves, after Jordana takes Polaroid pictures of Oliver and her kissing, and distributes them to classmates in order to make an ex-boyfriend jealous. As a result of their new found isolation, the two become closer. While well-intentioned, Oliver's continuous clueless actions cannot be excused because he's old enough to know right from wrong. At one point, after reading a book that offers the opinion that children are able to cope with death better as a result of experiencing the death of their own pets, Oliver considers poisoning Jordana's dog so that she can cope with her mother's impending death from a recent terminal cancer diagnosis. Oliver alienates Jordana further when he decides it's a better idea to leave Jordana alone as she copes with her stricken mother in the hospital.<br /><br />  The second part of the 'Submarine' plot involves Oliver's suspicions that his mother has been having an affair with next-door neighbor Graham Purvis, a new-age Guru, who peddles a wacky 'system' involving emotions and the color spectrum. Oliver's Dad is a depressed marine biologist who hardly seems upset when Oliver informs him that his mother might be having an affair. Oliver engages in the creepy surveillance of his mother and Graham at a New Year's Eve party at the beach. Later, he spies Graham and his mother entering Graham's trailer together and assumes the worst. There's more bad conduct from Oliver when he gets drunk and attempts to trash Graham's home, before passing out.<br /><br />  It's supposed to be funny when Oliver's parents coddle the wayward Oliver after the break-in as well as the mother admitting that she gave Graham a 'hand job', but at the same time indicating that she and her husband were reconciling (remember, anything can happen in a movie with 'quirky' characters!).<br /><br />  After all of Oliver's troublesome conduct during the film, director Ayoade wants us to conclude that \\"youths will be youths\\". Somehow, all the bad behavior is not so bad after all, since clueless Oliver was well-intentioned at the same time. Oliver's 'reward' at film's end is the implied reconciliation with love interest, Jordana. But there is little remorse from Oliver, who really needs to make up for all his bad conduct, especially the bullying he engaged in with his formerly besieged and ostracized classmate.<br /><br />  For all those who are enamored with these type of films featuring 'quirky' characters, I can only point out that they seem to operate in their own separate but dubious moral universe. Admire 'Submarine' for its neat cinematography and clever editing, but please recognize that such tomes add nothing to the pantheon of true art house fare.ky' characters!).

1250006341|5.0|This is a handsome book, whether or not you have seen the Downton Abbey series or not - it will make you want to. One can see how this series has enthralled and enchanted many.<br />It contains sections on family life, society, change, life in service, style, house and estate, romance, WWI and behind the scenes.  The writer, Julian Fellowes pens an eloquent introduction that sums up the series and book perfectly...\\"the shadows of what used to be\\". A page of portraits introduces us to the characters.<br /><br />This is a story not only of the filming, but a way of life - in fact two ways of life - the aristocracy and those in service. It is well explained, in an interesting manner, the difficulties and advantages both classes had. We learn how and why American heiresses became the wives of many of the English aristocracy and what the differences in philosophies of the two were.<br /><br />The social history is described, again of both classes and why they behaved as they did. There are historical pictures and inserts that are relevant. We learn so completely what this period of Edwardian history was like and also how the filming of this series was accomplished. The creating of the costumes is thoroughly detailed. There are some comments from the actors themselves, but the star of this book is the era itself.<br /><br />This is a book for Anglophiles, fans of Downton Abbey, those interested in English history especially of the Edwardian- WWI period and a social commentary on the English classes, It would be appropriate for anyone interested in filming and costume making also - a book that absolutely countless readers would enjoy.

B0019HQIFE|5.0|Perhaps its because so many examples of Blu Ray and surround sound audio are so bad, or perhaps it is because this Blu Ray is so good.  But if you are looking for something that can be used to make your home theater set-up shine, this is it.  The video quality is top notch. The audio is perfect.  Clean, clear, well balanced, and mixed for 5.1 perfectly.  If all 5.1 music was mixed like this everyone would buy much of it.  Perfection is in your hand when you hold the Blu Ray and it is in your room when you turn it on. The best of the three sets is the trio. I've never heard three musicians play with so much energy that you think it is a much larger band. Absolutely incredible.    Not only is John Mayer extremely talented as a musician, he is an entertainer of the highest degree as well.  I would have loved to have been at this concert in person.  Doing three sets with three different formats was genius.  It is a long concert.  John really gave his all for his fans. You can see how much he loves music and performing. His fans got every penny of their money from this concert.  Thank you John!
0783230079|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out in theaters in the early 90's. I loved it. It is an uncomplicated movie with a simple message. I have thought of it off and on over the years, but when I heard the song Heart and Soul, it made me remember this movie. I looked everywhere for it, but Amazon was one of the few places to carry it. Robert Downey Jr. is great in this film and the entire supporting cast makes this just a pleasure to watch. It has a simple message: Don't wait to do anything because you may not have a tomorrow.

B002GYI9C4|5.0|I first saw Mistborn as I rummaged through the fantasy section of the BYU bookstore. Its cover caught my eye and intrigued me, the young and bold Vin emerging from the mist into an obvious dystopian world. I have to admit, this novel saved me from the a nostalgic life(for me) of a college freshman society I thought I had been doomed to live.   Loved the story cover to cover. In high school I was a passionate reader of R A Salvatore and the Forgotten Realms series, and after those I delved into Robert Jordan's brilliant series \\"The Wheel of Time\\" (with the dragon reborn/rand al thor, aes sedi, ect...). This story however, was perfect for me. Strange as I consider it, I felt empathy for Vin in all of her journey, from the abused little slave, to a mighty Allomancer (and eventually the wife of Nobleman Elend).   Thank you Brandon Sanderson for your devotion to writing fantasy novels. I am your grateful fan.

B001HN6918|5.0|I have just finished watching the movie.  I didn't know what to expect since it is a sequel.  In my opinion, it is probably one of the best animation movies from Dreamworks.  The movie is funny and action packed. Strongly recommended.
B005VR9328|4.0|I am a \\"boomer,\\" and prior to this past year, I really hadn't listened to a lot of rap or hip hop music.  However, due to multiple influences, including my 17-year-old son, who loves this type of music, the rise of Pittsburghers Wiz Khalifa and Mac Miller, whom I wanted to support, and crossover collaborations between artists like Jay Z and Linkin Park, I have begun to listen to rap and hip hop more regularly.  Another influence has been The Roots, whom I like a lot.  When I picked up my first Roots CD at the library, I didn't even know that they were a hip hop band, because I had never heard of them before they backed up John Legend on the Awake CD, which definitely was not a hip hop production.  Being a concept album, Undun was an ambitious undertaking for the Roots.  I think that having a cohesive narrative structure to the whole CD helped them to stay focused throughout, secondary to which there is only one odd, ill fitting song, track 13, Will To Power, the third of four instrumental movements that conclude the CD, which is a frenetic piano meltdown that Keith Jarrett would have been proud of.  It also gave them a reason to avoid the type of sexist and bombastic lyrics that typically put me off from listening to rap and hip hop music.  I really respect The Roots for being consummate musicians, and they have come up with a winning formula for this CD.  That being said, I can understand why some people, who like all the music sampling and the bombastic lyrics would be disappointed with it.
B003Y5H574|4.0|I dislike Steve Carell.  I just don't get his acting.  Having said that, he did a wonderful job in this movie.  Although part of this movie is far fetched, overall, the movie is funny and it does make a married person reflect on his or her relationship with the spouse.  I hate to say this- Steve Carell is likeable in this movie.  Oh, I think I want to puke now.
B001KZVQJI|4.0|Peter Jackson's KING KONG heaps a great deal of cheese on the viewer but the view is spectacular and the heart wrenching final episodes are exactly why movies are made and what separates the good from the bad.  Incredible picture on the blu-ray and the sound is equally amazing.    The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is some of the juvenile dialogue and the CGI juggling was just strange.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I have never been a big fan of X-Men.  I decided to check out this movie because there has been so many positive reviews.  I watched the Blu-ray version of the movie.  It really is a well made movie with awesome special effects.  However, this movie is very violent and it is definitely not suitable for young children.  Other than that, I would definitely recommend it.

B0015DYIH2|1.0|Spoilers, although nothing you probably haven't guessed already.  I've read all four books of this so-called saga, out of OCD obsession of finishing what I start.  I feel sorry for myself.  My English teacher was absolutely obsessed with this book, and when we did our Pride and Prejudice unit, all she did was compare Darcy and Bennet with Edward and Bella. So I picked up the full set and started reading.  Ugh. And I thought I'd seen everything with Eragon.  I'm not even that hard to please. A couple of good characters and a plausible plot, I'll read it. I'll even ignore your purple prose and your annoying cliches and your terrible grammar and your inability to write concisely.  So, here's a couple of my issues of basic characterization and plot:  1. Bella: She's the &#34;heroine&#34;, so you have to root for her. So apparently since I wanted James to hurry up and KILL HER, Meyer didn't do a very good job. Bella is shallow, whiny, and the worst person you could pick as a narrator. She's supposedly shy and unspecial, yet all the characters completely fawn over her. Can anyone else spell Mary Sue? She's flat and static, which is NOT what you want your main character to be. Frankly, there are several people who have summed up Bella's whiny character much better, so I won't go into much detail.  2. Edward: I hate him. I'm sorry. Meyer just makes him far too perfect. A little bloodlust over Bella that is completely gone by Book 3 is not a character flaw. He's immortal, he's sexy (Meyer never lets us forget that!), he's rich, he freaking SPARKLES, he's fast, he's strong, he can read minds... The list goes on and on. Yet, I can't name a flaw. Do you think Harry Potter was perfect? What about Mr. Darcy, Heathcliff, or Romeo? If you want to create an interesting, compeling character, you need to create a reasonable balance strengths and weaknesses.  3. Jacob: He had so much potential. He was funny, had flaws and depth. Oh, and then Stephenie Meyer promptly killed him off as apedo...er...dog. And that part with Jacob's point of view? Other then the amusing chapter titles, it was pretty much like Bella's point of view. And imprinting on Renesmee (who the bloody hell names their kid that?)? Right back to the whole pedodog thing. It's sad that someone with so much potential just falls flat on his face.  4. Supporting Characters (Alice, Jasper, Rosalie, Carlisle, Charlie): They were interesting. I loved their backstories. How did Meyer manage to make her minor characters deeper and more compelling than her main ones?  5. Renesmee: That's just messed up and weird on so many levels.  6. Contradictions: First, Meyer tells us that vampires are infertile. And then BOOM Edward impregnates Bella. Wow. Didn't see that one coming. You don't contradict your own worlds. What if Rowling broke her own rules? &#34;Oh, wait, to make Harry's life easier, we'll be able to destroy Horcruxes by [insert whatever you want here]. Oh, and that scientific mumbo-jumbo Carlisle sprouts? Ha, I'm not buying what you're selling.  7. Anti-Climatic: I couldn't wait for the Volturi. I wanted an epic fight scene where maybe one of the good vampires would die! (I was really disappointed by the battle with the newborns. Nobody important died.) But nooooo, they talk like a bunch of damn politicians and...leave.  What. Well, sure as #$%& didn't see that coming.  8. Killing Trees: Well, since all the Volturi did was talk and leave, then about 2/3 of the second Bella book was unnecessary. Seriously, why go on about the &#34;clue&#34; (Clue? What is this, Nate the Great? Actually, Nate the Great is more suspenseful. Scratch that.) abour J Jenks and collect like sixty random vampires if nothing important's going to happen...?  9. Love Shield: Lily Potter pulled it off. Our &#34;beautiful swan&#34; did not.  10. I know I said I wouldn't comment on her prose, but I want to point out we don't grimace, glare, chuckle or murmur every five seconds.  11. Also, we don't use &#34;a scarcity of funds&#34; to describe buying a car.  12. It doesn't rain everyday in Washington.  13. Bella's Control Thing: Because obviously Meyer decided that prattling on about gathering a motley crew of vampires was far more interesting than a gripping struggle of containing bloodlust.  14. They aren't even werewolves.  15. I'm thirteen, so this targeted towards me. I just want to remind everyone that we aren't all Twihards. My friends and I laud you, Meyer, for being such an awesome comedian.  So, let me summarize this saga:  Bella moves to Forks. She meets Edward Cullen and falls in love with him for no apparent reason. This is followed by several insipid conversations. Then, there was a terribly boring thing about some evil vampire. Edward leaves her and Bella falls into deep depression. Oh, and then Jacob comes along. They talk. Eddikins comes back and Bella promptly drops Jacob like a piece of garbage. Bad vampires come, the good vampires and the werewolves beat the crap out of them. Then Edward and Bella get married, they make love, Bella has a baby, she becomes a vampire, they have a boring faceoff with the Volturi. (Political debates are more interesting.)  Oh, and Meyer, I'm a vampire fantic. Even if you wanted to original, your vampires aren't even vampires. They're immune to stakes and holy water, they can go out in the sun, they don't drink human blood, they don't sleep in coffins...  I would suggest J.K. Rowling, Vivian Vande Velde, Ann Rice, Eoin Colfer, Trenton Lee Stewart, Agatha Christie, Michael D. Beil, Brandon Mull, or Pam Munoz Ryan to this crap. Heck, even Christopher Paolini was better. And if you're an animanga fan, I suggest Hellsing, a vampire series.  I'm ready, Twihards. You can come after me with pitchforks and Edward Cullen cardboard cutouts.  Peace.

0143039482|4.0|*No spoilers*<br /><br />If you're reading these reviews and still haven't made up your mind to get this book, hopefully I can give you that one final push - for or against it.<br /><br />When I started reading the first chapter, my first thought was, \\"What prompted me to read this?\\" It reminded me of required reading in high school, but without the distraction of good-looking classmates. But I persevered. And I was immediately rewarded with excellent characters, memorable descriptions of time and place - without being overly wordy - and one-liners that truly need to be read to be appreciated.<br /><br />As I am writing this review, I realize there were a lot more characters than I realized. This is a testament to Steinbeck's writing that I was never confused about how a character fit into the story. If you've ever wondered \\"How well do I really know someone?\\" or \\"How well do I know myself?\\" then you are in for quite a treat since this seems to be woven into every relationship in this novel. If you get the chance to discuss this with a book club, you'll probably have a field day! Also for the book club, the Penguin Classics version has explanatory notes and a 22-page introduction by Susan Shillinglaw, though I personally had no use for this.<br /><br />In a 280-page book, it would be hard to duplicate the inner thoughts of the characters, the descriptions of inanimate objects, motives and family history that stick with us after we read 'The Winter of Our Discontent'. Perhaps I have read others like this, but none come to mind.<br /><br />Finally, I wanted to add some quotes from the book that showcase Steinbeck's wit and thoughtfulness. This was what really kept me focused and smiling as I read. From the 'Penguin Classics' paperback edition:<br /><br />p.5<br />(Mary, Ethan's wife, sends him to get some eggs for the children. Ethan jokingly retorts.)<br />Ethan: \\"Why two dozen?\\"<br />Mary: \\"For dyeing. Allen and Mary Ellen asked specially. You better go.\\"<br />Ethan: \\"Okay bugflower - but can't I just go up and beat the hell out of Allen and Mary Ellen?\\"<br /><br />p. 72<br />(Ethan is discussing the old days of pirates and their search for gold with his son, Allen)<br />Allen: \\"I wouldn't mind that. I'd get the gold and bring it home. I guess they won't let you do it any more.\\"<br />Ethan: \\"No - it's bigger and better organized now. They call it diplomacy.\\"<br /><br />p.149<br />(Ethan's young daughter, Mary Ellen is chastising Ethan for not listening to her, then leaves the room)<br />\\"She lounged away, a baby-fatted volupt. Girls kill me. They turn out to be girls.\\"<br /><br />Since I promised no spoilers, I will end here and encourage you to try this book for yourself.nd Mary Ellen?\\"  p. 72  (Ethan is discussing the old days of pirates and their search for gold with his son, Allen)  Allen: \\"I wouldn't mind that.

B001F6TXME|5.0|I bought this Nikon unit for my D90 (it also works on the D3100) after the Zeikos remote unit failed. Although the Nikon unit is a few more dollars, I am very happy with the purchase.  My main reason for purchasing the unit was not only to get a sharper shot from a tripod (less vibration than pushing the shutter release manually), but I wanted very long exposures for night shots. These exposures of 30 minutes or even 6 hours, are not capable without the remote shutter release. So, I put it to the test a few weeks ago in the chilly New England air and could not be happier. The   If this is your first time with a cable release unit, here are some notes that may be helpful for you:  1. Once you get the unit plugged in, the camera switches to live view. In my case, this meant getting the focus exactly where I wanted it through the viewfinder, since I don't care for live view. There may be a way around this, but I don't know it. (If you do, please leave a comment for myself and others.)  2. If you want to use the long, manual exposures, you MUST switch the camera to manual (M) setting and adjust shutter to \\"bulb\\". This will allow you to click and lock the shutter release for any extended period. To stop the exposure, simply unlock the shutter release by sliding off the lock on the remote. Remember to start with a strong battery. This unit is very, very easy to work with.  3. The cable length is about 40 inches, which is a problem for some people. Know this in advance. If you prefer to shoot from in front of the camera, you may want to consider Nikon's wireless remote. Otherwise, you may have to consider an extension/adapter of some sort.  All said, this is a great product which may help you get more creative with your exposures or help you get that tack-sharp photo by reducing vibration.
0545265355|5.0|This was completely AMAZING!!!!! This series left my mind completely blown. The first one was thoroughly entertaining, and it kept me immersed in it. I finished the entire book in 4 days. The second was just as good, with a cliffhanger that made me start reading the third book immediately. However, the third book was a little disappointing. The ending did not leave me satisfied, and throughout the whole book, I wasn't craving to read it like I was with the other two books. It was not a bad book (in fact, it was very good), it just wasn't as good as the others. All in all, a fantastic series for anyone, no matter what you're age is. You can never be too old for a series like this, in my opinion.

B005PTQPU0|5.0|I was all set to review Kate Bush's latest thought-provoking collection of beauty, having waited until I had fully digested the album before deciding to analyze and review it, but then I checked out a homemade video of \\"Architect's Dream\\" on YouTube, and I was shot straight upwards from this album back to \\"Aerial\\"... \\"Aerial\\" was such a masterpiece, and it has moved me so much once again, that I'm left without anything of quality to say about \\"Snow\\"... \\"Snow\\" is the best album of the year by anyone, but that shows how much depth \\"Aerial\\" had that I am reviewing \\"Aerial\\" all over again on a \\"Snow\\" review page.  By the way, how did so many reviews of \\"50 Words for Snow\\" get written right when the album was released?  Kate Bush, more than anyone, needs her music to be heard repeatedly before any complete review can be written... not sure how music of such emotional value can be interpreted after one week.    Anyway, with this album, I am not left praying for Kate's existence to remain with us forever... after hearing \\"Aerial\\" again, I am praying and praying.

B005UKJX4E|1.0|This movie was all symbolism and no plot.  Nothing happened.  Lots of fractals, no story.  Wait till it comes out for free somewhere then watch the first five minutes and the last five minutes and you'll realize that nothing happens.  I want $100 back. $4 for the rental fee and the $43 an hour I didn't make by staying an extra two hours at work today.  The worst part was sitting there thinking something was going to happen but it never does. Maybe useful as a sleeping aid.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|What is wrong with this item? Nothing, if you don't know that there are already Blu Ray releases of the films in an extended cut...  This means that sometime in the not so distant future, Warner Bros. will release another box set of all Harry Potter movies, this time in their extended, or what is called \\"ultimate\\" version.  If you want high quality product, DO NOT buy this item. Wait for the extended editions. we've seen this before with The Lord of the Rings Blu Ray release, and it managed to create a shout then too.

B005HI4LMS|5.0|It is about time Magnolia put something good out.    Absolutely hilarious twist on the hillbilly genre.  Fantastic cast & writing.    When you first meet Tyler (Tucker) & Alan (Dale), you expect tobacco stains & banjo music.  The college kids are what you see in nearly every slasher flick.  The twist comes after a night of drinking around a camp fire & some skinny dipping.  As usual, I'm not going to give the movie away & a synopsis you can already find.  This I will say.  If you want a bunch of laughs with some OMFG!'s tossed in, you will love this movie.  Katrina Bowden is hot & funny too.
B000NMW6J8|2.0|The film starts out well enough, seems interesting, and then it just gets frustrating to see forced plot movements. The way it was shot was very lame at times, awkward angle shots, weird lighting, trying to be artistic and failing miserably. Like in the last scene when the FBI is all up in that basement garage of the building, and the main character runs back to the car, WHERE DID ALL THE COPS GO? I don't know, there was so much more potential in this story, but it became belaboring to finish the movie.

B004EPYZUS|5.0|I won't be cliche and tell you that your mission, should you choose to accept it... You know the rest.   Without a doubt, this is the best of all the Mission Impossible movies, including the original. Over the years, the MI franchise had become something of a cartoon of itself. So, it seemed appropriate that Brad Bird should be chosen to helm MI4 Ghost Protocol. As the Oscar winning director of the Incredibles, he made animated cartoons seem very real. Now, he's made Mission Impossible real again. He's injected a fresh breathe of confidence, humor and camaraderie into a series that sorely needed it. He's not only re-invigorated the franchise, he's re-invigorated Tom Cruise's career as an action star. With this movie, Tom is back on top.   You'll notice that there is a lot of the Incredibles in MI4 Ghost Protocol. That's not only because of Brad Bird's influence, but because the Incredibles was a humorous homage to action films. You could say it's the IMF meets the Incredibles. That is not a deterrent. It's a tribute to a director who can think outside the proverbial action box. This isn't the same old, same old. The movie is much more upbeat and doesn't take itself too seriously. Which works to its advantage.   Tom Cruise has never been better. This isn't the brooding Ethan Hunt of previous movies. He's a man on a mission. pardon the pun. To make a complicated story short, the IMF has been shut down and disavowed after a massive explosion at the Kremlin. That explosion is blamed on the IMF. But, it was nothing more than a diversion to steal a nuclear detonator by a terrorist hell bent on ensuring peace on Earth by starting a nuclear war between the super powers. It's up to Ethan, and his cobbled together disavowed team, to hunt down the nuclear terrorist and save the world. simple.   Once you have suspended disbelief, sit back and enjoy. The cast is uniformly excellent. Jeremy Renner plays an IMF analyst suit (with more than desk skills at his disposal) reluctantlyrecruited into the field. Paula Patton is the former team leader of a mission gone bad sent to rescue Hunt. Simon Pegg is back as Benji, the computer/technology genius. While it may seem like he's there just for comic relief, he is an integral part of the team. There are no dull moments. The movie has a quick pace, fun one liners and mind blowing special effects filmed in glorious IMAX. Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner both have sensational action sequences. Tom Cruise isn't the only actor who gets to jump off buildings. And if this movie is any indication, Jeremy Renner is going to make a fantastic Jason Bourne. This wasn't a vehicle for just Tom. Everyone gets a piece of the action. It's a true throw back to the original TV series.   and wait until you see the car. James Bond would trade in his Aston Martin for it.
0743539133|5.0|This review is from: Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (Audio CD)<br />As much as I admired Lincoln and held him in the highest esteem, this book ratched up the effect. There are lessons here about leadership yet I don't think anybody can duplicate the greatness of Lincoln. Also, on a personal level I didn't see anything in it for him other than to do what he thought was good.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|This is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen. Apart from the thrilling action, the masterfully artful way that Senna's story has been told in this movie is most definitely deserving of the accolades that the film has received.

B000Q6GUTI|5.0|This turned out to be an entertaining movie. The hero of this movie is Bob Lee Swagger well played by Mark Wahlberg. Swagger has retired from the Marine Corps as a  sniper and Force Recon. He has made his home in the mountains of Wyoming. He is  found by a government organization and offered a job by Danny Glover. Swagger is to help prevent an assassination of the President of the United States. He winds up  being double crossed by Danny Glover and his crew. Swagger becomes the most hunted man in America. He is shot and wounded and has to go underground. He is protected  by a Marine Corp widow. An FBI agent who believes Swagger also aids him. Swagger  starts pitting the pieces together and discovers who is behind this conspiracy. You  have many gun battles where Swagger demonstrates his shooting skills. Swagger also  disvovers that a U.S. Senayor from Montana is also deeply involved. It appears that  Danny Golver and his evil comrades have escaped justice. This movie has a surprise ending. Be sure to watch this movie. You will nor forget it.
B005UT29Z0|3.0|Im looking forward to this movie but there is no way im going to rent it for $6.99. Ill continue to wait and see if RedBox will have it soon.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|This is actually a great movie but it normally gets attacked from three sides: fanatics about the 1982 original, movie critics who don't understand the survival-horror genre, and nit pickers who'll attack anything...I really enjoyed and was scared by this movie and I'm as jaded as the next person by bad horror. The Scandinavian actors are great and so are the American ones for that matter.  The director could have done better in terms of dragging out the suspense...that is my main gripe...the movie is great but too short and a lot more action oriented than the first movie..btw..they do a great job linking both movies together in continuity terms...  This movie is streets ahead of a lot of the horror movies we've had to endure over the last decade so pick up the Blu-ray...it's well worth it...

B005OOSPZO|5.0|I will not go through the history of December 7th, 1941 or what leads up to that famous day.  This review is for the Blu Ray of Tora, Tora, Tora.  Tora, Tora, Tora had a clear, clean print now available on Blu Ray.  The Blu Ray has two verisons of the film, the theatrical and Japanese extended.  This was a great surprise and well worth the wait!    The Blu Ray also has several documentaries.  Most of these are from \\"Tora! Tora! Tora! (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)\\".  The book is a little thin, about 10 pages, but has a lot of facts, information, and photos.    The main question would be, is it worth it?  My answer would be, \\"Yes\\".

1568814518|2.0|I bought this book with the belief that it would give me clear instructions with enough explanation on how to fold tessellations. The style of writing is friendly. The images and photos of the designs are glorious but how to actually achieve them seems to be illusive. I found the written instructions made little sense and I am frustrated at the obstacle of trying to make sense of what is being said. It seems to be written for those whose experience is more extensive. I have made some tessellations from other sources and looks like I will have to continue to do so as this book does not solve my problems.
0345479092|5.0|Before I read this book, I was completely against parenting books. My husband brought it home by chance one day when I was just a few months pregnant. He had found it at work and his boss let him bring it home for a few weeks. I read it cover to cover a few times over the next few months and then bought my own copy to keep for reference.<br /><br />I applied most of the tecniques and suggestions that Tracy gave and it has carried us through the difficult moments. We have obviously had our ups and downs but it has been so much easier than what I thought parenting would be like. Our son is now three and he is sweet, polite, well-behaved and manageable in so many ways. Everyone we know comments on how easy going he is. I know that part of it is character but I am convinced that this book has a huge impact on how we raised him and how he is today. The most important thing to keep in mind is that the suggestions are just suggestions and to mold them to fit your baby and his/her temperament and your families needs. For us it meant making a lot of sacrifices and getting grandparents on board as well. It was well worth it and if I had to go back and do it again, I wouldn't change a thing!<br /><br />There is also an online resource [...] which is a place to go and ask all of your questions to mothers who have also read this book and have the same parenting philosophy. This was my life-saver during the first year!<br /><br />I recommend this book to all of my friends and family who are expecting and they gladly accept it! They always ask my secret for raising such a well-tempered little boy. :-)
B005SODYGA|5.0|I consider myself a big Rammstein fan, saw them live for the first time this year, amazing show, and I got a pit ticket for their Made In Germany show in Philly, now onto the album. Overall I think this is a pretty solid best of, but they are missing, Ich Tu Dir Weh, Rammlied, Asche Tu Asche, Rammstein, Seemann, White Flesh, Puta, Benzin, Feur Frie, Buck Dich, and Stripped. But overall a solid best of especially for a new convert to Rammstein to start at, but if you are \\"one of those\\" fans, like me, you'll buy anything Rammstein. The Remixes are pretty good, and they would feel at home in a MK game soundtrack, my personal favorite is the Rammlied remix, so hilarious, and that song is very heavy live, and to hear it with banjo's, and farting effects is something to smirk about. And onto the song that is Mein Land, probably one of my favorites, next to Mein Teil, and Sonne. Buy this album!

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have to say I have been waiting for this to come out for a long time. I am glad that it did finally come out and I think it looks amazing. I know there are people that are disapointed George Lucas made some changes to the movie but, I think it looks great. I would rather watch a movie that has been cleaned up a bit. I do like the orginial three movies untouched as I have seen them and kinda wish that George Lucas hadn't put Hayden Christensen in the last movie at the end. But, that part is a minor detail. Enough, when I put the first movie in and turned on the tv I was AMAZED and smiled while watchin the movies. My friends made the comment like, YOU REALLY LIKE STAR WARS, after watching movies one through three in a matter of days. Excellent buy, excellent picture quality, excellent sound I wouldn't change anything about it. Star Wars fans new and old would love this I recommend buying this you won't be sorry.

0517548232|5.0|If you are looking for a review of school/college microeconomics, buy one of the Economic outlines here at AMAZON [[ASIN:0471317527 Economics: A Self-Teaching Guide (Wiley Self-Teaching Guides)]]. If you want a good basic understanding of economics - read this book. Hazlitt wrote a book for the general public to understand basic microeconomics applied to governmental policy. Even though he uses examples from the US, it can be applied against all modern nation states.<br /><br />His basic thesis is not politically motivated to any particular (special) group. He writes:<br />\\"THE WHOLE ARGUMENT of this book may be summed up in the statement that in studying the effects of any given economic proposal we must trace not merely the immediate results but the results in the long run, not merely the primary consequences but the secondary consequences, and not merely the effects on some special group but the effects on everyone.\\"<br /><br />For every monetary unit a government gives out to one group, they must acquire it through taxation, printing more money on taking on morew debt from all of us.<br /><br /> Some say this book is dated, but \\"printing money\\" is now called \\"Quantitative Easing\\". The 1932 Federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act is now TARP or \\"too big to fail\\". This book was written 60 years ago, but he explains in perfect detail what happened in the Housing Crisis of 2007/8:<br /><br />\\"Government-guaranteed home mortgages, especially when a negligible down payment or no down payment whatever is required, inevitably mean more bad loans than otherwise. They force the general taxpayer to subsidize the bad risks and to defray the losses. They encourage people to \\"buy\\" houses that they cannot really afford. They tend eventually to bring about an oversupply of houses as compared with other things. They temporarily overstimulate building, raise the cost of building for everybody (including the buyers of the homes with the guaranteed mortgages), and may mislead the building industry into an eventually costly overexpansion.\\"<br /><br />If you have gotten \\"lost\\" or \\"confused\\" the past few years with the various economic theories presented & debated though the various media outlets, this book brings you back to the basic \\"common sense\\" understanding of basic economics and how it affects you.ostly overexpansion.\\"  If you have gotten \\"lost\\" or \\"confused\\" the past few years with the various economic theories presented & debated though the various media outlets, this book brings you back to the basic \\"common sense\\" understanding of basic economics and how it affects you.

I don't think it woulld matter who did the acting,    I couldn't get into the movie.  Too much cheese and a bit slow.  Why do Hollywood aliens typically have two legs, two arms, two eyes, two ears, and a nose?

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|There is a scene in this Terrence Malick magnum opus where two brothers about 9 and 11 are running along the banks of a stream or river.  One has a BB gun.  They take turns shooting into the water or at trees.  Finally the older boy dares the other to put his finger in front of the barrel.  This was me many years ago.  There were several scenes in this film that will likely bring back memories, especially for those who remember small towns, unlocked houses and inventing things to do when there was no electronic stimulation.  The film opens when Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) gets a telegram.  As was usually the case in decades past, telegrams often carried bad news.  This is no exception.  She learns that one of her sons has died.  He was 19.  We don't know how or why.  She calls her husband (Brad Pitt) at work to give him the news.  For anyone with children, this hit to the gut is devastating to both the family and the audience and brings us quickly into the film.  The grief of the O'Brien's transcends into memories of a better time.  A time of birth of their three boys.<br /><br />Malick then tosses in a 16 minute foray into his ideas of the creation of the Universe and evolution.  With the help of legendary filmmaker and photography pioneer Douglas Trumbull and numerous others, Malick creates his own visual extravaganza including early life on planet Earth.  Yes, there are a couple dinosaurs.  But not a T-Rex or some other well known species.  We see one on a beach, just arrived from the sea.  We see one, similar to an ostrich but with teeth, pin down another unfortunate enough to have short legs.  He then just walks away.  Just another day on earth 80 million years ago.  This trip will challenge your Blu ray display and your surround system.  In fact an opening line before the movie begins suggests that you play the film loud and I agree.  Not only for the great sounds and beautiful soundtrack but because, the actors will speak over a scene in a reverent whisper.  The O'Brien's are a God fearing family and do their best to honor Him.<br /><br />The film set mostly in the 1950's around Waco, Texas but the town isn't clearly identified.  I suspect this was done on purpose.  It could have been a small town in Indiana, California or New York.  A time of large yards, clean water and open spaces.  A time when most of the crime was vandalism at the hand of kids overcoming boredom.  While we are never sure of the circumstances or identity of the son who has died, we know it isn't Jack the oldest.  He is now a successful architect in a big city.  As an adult he is played by Sean Penn.  When he enters the movie he is speaking with his father by phone.  Something is wrong.  Again, Malick keeps us in the dark but we suspect another family member has died.  The film closes the circle of life on a beach.  Perhaps a metaphor for entering Heaven.  Throughout the film Malick focuses on the balance between \\"grace\\" represented by Mrs. O'Brien and \\"nature\\" represented by Mr. O'Brien.  Keeping this in mind may be helpful understanding this potentially divisive movie.  \\"The Tree of Life\\" is like no other film and certainly one of the best of the year.  The Blu ray disc is of reference quality.  The extras are minimal, but include a trailer and an interesting making of documentary.r.

B004EPYZV2|4.0|Brad Bird steps into the live action arena directing this fourth installment of the \\"Mission: Impossible\\" franchise.  He is best known for terrific animated classics like \\"Iron Giant\\" and \\"The Incredibles.\\"  Let's hope he continues along the path of live action.  I think this is the best action based thriller I've seen all year.  We pick up the story years after IM agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has lost his wife.  He is in a Russian prison and a plan is afoot to break him out.  Why now?  In the opening sequence (shot in IMAX) an IM agent (Josh Holloway) has successfully obtained secret launch codes from nefarious types intent on World destruction.  As he is about to rendezvous with his team he is killed by another assassin.  She escapes with the codes.<br /><br />Hunt is extricated and sent on an impossible mission to obtain confirmation codes from the Kremlin.  In the grand scheme of thing, this isn't all that important.  Following plot protocols that go back decades, American good guys are out to save the world from political zealots.  I'm not minimizing all this.  There must be a story and frankly, this one can actually be followed.  It is all a setup however for some of the best aerial cinema photography ever shot.  While I'm sure CGI was used on occasion, it's not evident.  The stunts sure seem real and let's give some credit to the cast who perform them, especially Cruise who is at the top of his game.  The small 4 person team (now disavowed by the United States) escapes a botched Kremlin theft and chase down the real thief, Hendricks played by Michael Nyqvist (\\"The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo\\").  Beautiful Paula Patton plays a no nonsense agent Jane Carter.  Simon Pegg as techie Benji and Jeremy Renner as agent Brandt complete the crew and add a bit of tension breaking humor.<br /><br />This leads to a thrilling set of events involving the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the tallest building in the world.  I would suggest seeing this in IMAX will leave you squirming in your seat.  I would also add that while only a few scenes are actually shot using IMAX cameras, they blend seamlessly into those shot in 70 mm.  This film is fast and furious with nonstop action that will leave you invigorated and worn out at the same time. I can't wait to see it again.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE:<br /><br />This is my first viewing since seeing this action thriller on the IMAX screen.  While, it loses a bit of the big screen luster seeing it only on a 63\\" plasma there is plenty of movie to keep up with.  The Blu ray transfer is, in a word, spectacular.  Brilliant colors, great detail, dynamic panoramic shots are exemplary.  The audio is a lossless Dolby TrueHD 7.1 and it is equally good.  This movie has sound effects that range from soft electronic hums to chaotic action sequences and a massive sand storm.  It's all good.eave you squirming in your seat.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|So, Little Miss Sunshine is a rare movie. It has all the trappings of a terrible film. Child beauty pageants, road trips, and drugs. Yet, it manages to make them ironic and endearing. This movie certainly did not make me want to load up three generations of my family to cross the country in a last ditch effort to vicariously succeed at something. It did make me glad that I watched their family do it. With a drug and sex crazed grandfather whose wise cracks are actually wise to Abigail Breslin's genius debut as Olive, the one everyone has wrapped their hopes and dreams into, this cast delivers smart dialogue and inspired performances. Don't watch it with your 8 year-old though. Wait until she is 12.

B0011ZVKVG|4.0|If you are a fan of fear factory this album is a must have, some of their best songs. The album starts of really really strong, but starts to fade out about half way through. Those songs on the first half make it a must have though. Also check out \\"Remanufacture\\" which has really good remixes of the songs from this album. Zero signal one of the best songs on the album was on the Mortal Combat soundtrack.

B00632HWOG|3.0|There is some debate about whether or not we should use this app or the stock Android app MAIL. There is no debate if you want to search all your folders or go back further in your history than just a few weeks. The Yahoo app works best for switching between folders and searching. Most of the time you may not need this function but when you do this will matter.<br /><br />One reason for the middling score: attachments still don't always work right in this app. Sometimes to view an attachment (say a picture) I find that I have to go to the browser and view it there. Once this is fixed I could definitely move the rating up.

I commute daily on the bus and this sleeve makes it extremely easy to remove and restore my Kindle very quickly. In addition it offers great protection for the Kindle Fire.  I have been using it for a month now and have no complaints.  Since I have liked it so much, I just ordered a second one for my sister's new Kindle Fire.

B005N95JA4|5.0|I already own several releases of Some Girls, in every media ever issued from vinyl up to CD. The remastering is very good, but what really is the icing on the cake is the 12 new songs. This Stones fanatic has died and gone to heaven. This isn't like more recent Stones releases. This is the real deal from the '70s. If you like old Stones then this CD is a must have. While Some Girls is classic Stones, the new songs will just add to their popularity and make for a truly enjoyable listening experience. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Greatest Rock 'n Roll Band of all times, The Rolling Stones!<br /><br />Be sure and purchase the Deluxe Edition to receive the new songs.
B00008G9JO|5.0|Ian Anderson like all musicians had a peak period and this was it. From Aqualung, Thick As A Brick, Passion Play, War Child, Minstrel In The Gallery, Songs From The Woods and Heavy Horses. The hits just kept coming, and this is one of my favorites to listen to today. I had the pleasure of seeing the band 6 times through this period and man did Ian and the boys put on a show. The mix of rock and folk music on this album is remarkable. The difference between \\"No Lullaby\\" and \\"Moths\\" one a hard rocker and the other a  mellower folk type song and the fact that they fit together says all you need to know about the special songwriting ability of one Ian Anderson.   When it came out it was one of those albums that you just played over and over and never got tired of. This is one of the tightest bands that Ian had put together and they can rock. As always Martin Barre proves why he is one of the best guitar players in classic rock. The two bonus tracks fit in perfectly with the other songs and make this a 5 star CD by any measure. If you haven't heard it yet but are interested in Tull, grab it. If you like your rock and roll mellow and clever, grab it. I can't recommend it enough as a true classic.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|This film is in many ways a drama that concerns us all because we produced the situation that prevailed after the victory/defeat of 1945.<br /><br />All Germans are responsible either because they voted for Hitler or because they were not able to unify against Hitler, thus enabling him to seize power with one third of the votes. Then you had the simple workers, employees and farmers who were hanged when trying to be trade-unionists, or deported. Everyone knew what it meant, saw the crimes and smelled the smoke.<br /><br />Then you had the middle and upper middle class, the university professors and intellectuals, the doctors and surgeons, the lawyers and judges who all decided that justice was the implementation of the law of the moment, hence of Hitler's law, and then in 1945 of the law imposed by the US or the USSR. The father and mother of the main male character are such people.<br /><br />Then you had those who came of age before the end of the war and got into it, including into the SS, like G&uuml;nther Grass. They took part in the atrocities, including Auschwitz, which is the case of the main female character. The liaison between the two main characters does not change one iota to that fact.<br /><br />Justice in that case cannot be only the retribution of a crime. It has to make sure the criminals they convict and sentence are really the authors of the acts that are brought against them. And in that case it is not true and the main male hero who is a law student when the trial takes place does not provide justice with what he knows, and that is a crime too.<br /><br />Three hundred people were burnt to death in a church whose doors had been locked and were not unlocked under the responsibility of six female SS. The problem for the court is to find out who is the leader of these six SS women. They satisfy themselves with the fact that the main female character acknowledges she wrote the report that was signed by the six women; that the five other women accuse this one to be the author. But they do not check if this woman can write. They assume she can. But she can't. The real leader of the six, the one who wrote the report is one of the five other women who was very lightly sentenced.<br /><br />But the main male character, and his law professor, does not do what he should have done: tell the court what he knew, that she was illiterate and that the sentence was a miscarriage of justice. Then later he will entertain a relation with her via mail only and cassettes since she could not read or write, without seeing that it was cruel since that amounted to reminding her of what must have been her only happy moment in her life, that three or four month long affair with him. And never, even after her suicide in prison before leaving, will he tell.<br /><br />That's not justice, that's vengeance and what's more blind or blinded vengeance. Justice was blindfolded on that occasion. The judges should have made sure but they assumed that one of Hitler's achievements, literacy for all, was true, in other words they did not do their job properly.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUthis woman can write.

0061733199|5.0|Although I purchased this as a camping guide, I was amazed at the dearth of information for all seasons so to say.  John `Lofty\\" Wiseman who spent twenty-six of his working years as a professional soldier in the Special Air Service (SAS) has penned an all-purpose book that will serve the reader from those who are simply setting up camp to those who find themselves in circumstances where they need to survive in the face of a natural disaster.  In other words, you need to ask yourself if you are willing to give up the ship or survive.<br /><br />This handbook has an amazing array of information (unexpectedly complete I might add) that I wasn't expecting.  The \\"SAS Survival Handbook\\" has it ALL and then some.  If you have an emergency preparedness kit, this is one book that should be in there right along with your food, water, medications, etc.  It could prove to be an invaluable lifesaver.  Needless to say, if you are just planning to use it when you go camping you won't end up being like Barney Fife, you won't have to depend on a little luck, you'll know what to do. This is a very lengthy review and if you are sure you want to have the book you might want to bypass it.  If you are uncertain, I did try to cover all the basics so you'll know exactly what you are getting.  And so, just what is in this book?<br /><br />It's critical that you acquire the skills to survive and learn about its main elements, \\"food, fire, shelter, water, navigation, and medicine.\\"  Wiseman stresses that in all circumstances you will learn how to make a PLAN:<br /><br />P - for Protection:  You'll learn how to find shelter, avert additional danger, the importance of staying in one location, etc.<br /><br />L - for Location:  You'll learn how to build a shelter to protect you from the elements so you can avert additional personal disaster and be prepared for rescue.<br /><br />A - for Acquisition:  You'll need to learn how to \\"look for water and food to help supplement your emergency supplies\\" while waiting for help to arrive.<br /><br />N - for Navigation:  By learning how to become a decent navigator it \\"will keep you on route and will often avert a survival situation.<br /><br />OTHER SKILLS/KNOWLEDGE YOU'LL LEARN ABOUT IN THIS BOOK<br /><br />ESSENTIALS AND STRATEGY.<br /><br />*  Emergency preparedness<br /><br />*  How to research your surroundings or the territory you'll be heading for<br /><br />*  The equipment you'll need (clothing, sleeping bags, packs, stowing kit, G.P.S., radios, etc.)<br /><br />*  How to prepare for the unexpected<br /><br />*  How to prepare a survival kit and what to put in it (matches, beta light, snare wire, flexible saw, medical kit, etc.)<br /><br />*  How to prepare a survival pouch that you can grab quickly in case of emergency.<br /><br />* How to select a knife which can be \\"an invaluable asset in a survival situation.\\"<br /><br />*  What to do when you are actually facing a disaster and how to cope with survival stress.<br /><br />*  You'll get a quick primer on survival needs and how to use the PLAN.<br /><br />*  How to find water from an assortment of sources from dew and condensation to obtaining it from plants.

The only weak spot is the one concerning disaster on the home front.  Although something to consider, it almost seemed to be an afterthought.  I don't feel the intent of the book was to focus on this area, but if you do, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.  It doesn't have reams of food storage information that some people are interested in.  The book is liberally illustrated with line drawings and specific full color illustrations which are excellent guides.<br /><br />There are many survival scenarios and numerous informative sidebars.  For example there are things such as trapping tips:  \\"Baiting a trap will attract the game.  In a survival situation food may be scarce but, if you know there are animals to trap, a little used as bait may bring large rewards.  The camping and survival sections and techniques are the strongest sections, any of which are worth the price of the book.  Would I buy it?  I did and because this was purchased as a gift, I'll probably be buying another one.  This is one book that is definitely one you should consider adding to your list, one that in case of emergency you wouldn't want to be without.save a life provided there are no other alternatives.    *  There is a section on natural medicine.

B004ZQBOK0|5.0|I purchased this cd after hearing one song from this particular band on the television. I usually listen to rock music, but this is a version of rock mixed with screamo and I absolutely love it!! This band is extremely talented and if you enjoy this type of music or even rock you will more than likely like this album. Give it a try :)
0307891372|5.0|Excellent product.  Shipped fast and had no problems from shipping.  Detailed maps and character guides that make selecting perks easy.
B000EQ4G5K|3.0|well, I classify as reasonable. Some good music, but for whom is it worth fan.  I recommend. This time it arrived well before the estimated time.
0767903854|5.0|One of the funniest read I've ever enjoyed, brings back many memories of our drive in the Australian Outback. The service and products from this supplier were excellent.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|This is a solid album. You can listen to the entire album without skipping or stopping. I was most impressed with her vocal capability and range. A Must Have!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Anyone who wants to read the Bible will enjoy this app! Many translations, reading plans, and even a place to share notes with others.
0312370849|5.0|Wonderful story, complex and engaging.  At points, I could not put this book down.  The author lets you truly know the characters.  Recommend highly to any reader.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|The album will become a classic and is a must for holiday music lovers. It has brightened up my holiday season
0696204800|1.0|I love to review quilt books and wish I could say something more positive about this one.  This book is not working for me.  Copywrited in 1994, the color combinations are from that era so I found it did not relate to my quilt aesthetic at all.  With instructions like, \\"Make BB unit (8 times and 8 reverse).  Join 2 BB units together (4 times)\\".  Cutting instructions showed up on page 307 under the heading \\"Making Templates\\" where it instructs readers to create templates from plastic - no thank you.<br /><br />Let me just say, quilt book authors have come a long way in writing clear and simple-to-follow cutting, sewing, and quilting instruction.  What this book offers though, is 320 pages of quilt blocks along with their names, so you could add it to your library and use it as a reference guide.<br /><br />The book title says, \\"501 Quilt Blocks - A Treasury of Patterns for Patchwork & Applique\\", so if you are looking for a collection of traditional quilt block patterns and their names, buy this book.  But if you want to know how to ASSEMBLE these quilt blocks, I encourage you to look elsewhere.
B005OUB7MQ|5.0|As a long time fan of Broken Social Scene, I of course bought Feist's first album and liked it.  Honestly, that album was just a touch too poppy for me though.  I'm not too much of a fan of the \\"candy pop\\" albums, but her voice more than made up for it.  So when I heard that Metals was coming out, I was excited, but hesitant.  It only took a couple of preview listens for me to bite.  Now I am mesmerized.  There is so much soul in this album it oozes the spirit of Feist.  I am happily intoxicated.  This album is beautiful!
B004PGO25O|3.0|Intention of the book is clearly stated in its' title. It succeeds in the sense of focusing you on the goal, helping you identify and fight the obstacles and keeps you going on. What I didn't like is that it tries to be too much \\"meta\\". At moments it's metaphysical, meta-religious, etc. No, I don't mind the occasional spirituality. It's understandable. After all, the author is a fiction writer and inspiration is the key to success in the field and many other fields.  Overall, the flow of starting and key points to succeeding with your endeavor of any kind is well presented. You should read the book if your starting some change in your life.  If you're starting a business, you should read the Rework too for some concrete stuff.  [[ASIN:0307463745 Rework]]
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|As many of you know, Fright Night-originally- was a 1985 American Horror film that was directed by Tom Holland. Loved by fans, it told the story of Charley Brewster who's a young high school boy who discovers that his next door neighbor is a Vampire. Realizing this,  Charley turns to his hero: Peter Vincent to help him get rid of the problem. Because Charley won't look the other way(so to speak), his next door neighbor intends on taking Charley down and taking his girlfriend away from him and making her a Vampire. That's when things got interesting.<br /><br />Course, this ain't the 1985 film...it's the 2011 remake(reimagining, whatever you choose to call it). Basically, The central plot of the movie is, exactly, the same. However, if you're coming into this thinking it's a scene for scene remake of the original, &lt;grins an evil grin> you're in for a real eyeopener.<br /><br />Take one part From Dusk til Dawn, one part Blade, one part '85 Fright Night(of course) and shake extremely well and the end result is our new 2011 remake. While this movie does have some humorous moments to it, for the most part- it's played seriously with our Vampire, Jerry, being a vicious unfeeling bloodsucking spawn. Heck, even Chris Sarandon(the 1985 film's antagonist) makes an appearance. I really enjoyed it myself.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the movie, however, is how it gets straight to the point(almost expecting you to know certain things from the '85 film). By the time you get invested and get to know all the characters in the movie, it's over. Maybe it was intended to be this way, maybe not. Either way, I kinda frowned on that aspect.<br /><br />Otherwise, Fright Night is one of those remakes that does the original proud. There are very few out there in a time of constant remakes that have actually been able to do that. &lt;Thumbs up>
0307891372|5.0|If you're going to get a guide make sure it's a Prima guide.  They always do the best work.  I got the guide more for my game collection than needing it for the game but it does come in very handy when crafting an in game item.
B0061S073A|5.0|This app is a great way to keep your little one using only the apps that you want them to!  easy to use!
B000068CNX|5.0|fast shipment. great series. not too much else to say.. if you've seen it you before you already know, if you havent seen it, pick up the first season.
B005UBNKZG|1.0|I got this 8120 and put it in a new Sabertooth 990X... The CPU was a total waste of money. I could have had an 1100T for less and done twice the work!!!  Even overclocked on water to 4.2GHZ, the 1090T still outperforms in actual PPD numbers by a LOT!!! This was installed in a dedicated BOINC machine and so badly underperformed I took it out and put the 1090T back in.  Truly a total waste of money and AMD screwed the whole desktop community with this design. They should have redone the 1090T vintage, done the process shrink and made calculation improvements, but instead decided to make it a SERVER chip for data movement with poor FPU performance. The 955BE outperforms in dedicated BOINC (WCG type) tasks in general.  Very poor design, a step backward for the sake of saying \\"I got 8 cores!!!\\" but they forgot to mention they are slow as frozen rock...
B002H3EUAE|5.0|When I first saw this in a theatre I laughed so loud and long I cryed and nearly w,,, myself. But I was not alone as most everyone was laughing also. The flying saucer scence is over the top. Its laugh upon laugh from begining to end. It is now and has been for years a Christmas event in my family.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I use this app almost exclusively for Excel spreadsheets.  I've also tried QuickOffice and DocsToGo but OfficeSuite is the best.  I love the support for password protection, the brilliant handling of cell comments, easy switching between worksheets, and ability to resize columns via simple &quot;click-and-drag.&quot;  The developer(s) really thought through the details.  The only thing it was missing was integration with my Box account.  Now that I have that, it's near perfect!  OfficeSuite Pro + Box = the best mobile office solution available!
014241543X|3.0|Maybe it's because I listened to it via audiobook instead of reading it, but I really didn't understand why she made that choice (won't spoil it for you). It was a decent book, but I wasn't as emotionally attached as I'd hoped to be.
1451627289|5.0|This is my second King novel. \\"It\\" was the other one. This one is just as good as \\"It\\". I would have loved to understand more details about the aftermath in 2011 that the hero experienced. It seemed a little light. And I could hear the song \\"Teen Angel\\" playing in the last chapter.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|My wife and I got this in through Netflix and gave it a watch on one of our date nights and enjoyed it overall.  There was some kinda crass talk in parts of it that kinda bugged me, but overall I thought it was pretty enjoyable..at least worth a watch.  Timberlake and Kunis were pretty good in this, and there were laughs to be had fairly consistently throughout the movie's entirety.  If you're into romantic comedies, this is definitely one you'll want to watch!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I really like this app, but it takes many days to update on Amazon after the update on the Android store.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|This case has the perfect thickness for protection, nice size and shape and colors are beautiful. Perfect for protection to throw in your purse or bag.
B005H0IW6W|1.0|Here's how you tell if someone has an ounce of originality in their soul:  they do a different take on a classic.  In the case of this song:  MAJOR FAIL.  Feel free to enter these words into Google:  \\"White Christmas, Drifters.\\"  There you'll hear, note for note, THIS arrangement, in this case with Ms. Twain taking the high parts sung by Clyde McPhatter.  Oh, and the Drifters are black, so we got that white folks ripping the black originals thing going.  Very sad.    Heard this on the 12/16/11 Vinyl Cafe show broadcast over public radio.  Ahem, Stuart McLean?  You're wrong to say this is \\"his version\\" of White Christmas.
B00164KYV4|2.0|For a while, this movie appears to go along with the book's premise, showing various ways that ladies should understand when a guy is not really deeply interested in them. Just when we feel like we are getting it, the movie abandons all that to mostly happy endings with reluctant guys coming completely around to total commitment of love. Some of the characters don't quite go that way, and there is some good acting. Many of the turns make no sense, like Ben Affleck's change of heart. He has no problem with commitment, but strongly is against marriage. What does he do when Aniston pines for him, but won't be with him without getting married? You guessed it Hollywood, he asks her to marry him! We never get to see the complexities of him selling out on his beliefs or overcoming whatever created them, he just does it and she's happy. Playboy Justin Long's sudden realization that he's in love with Gigi ain't romantic, it's just ridiculous. Furthermore, we never get to see any reason Bradley Cooper would even like his wife, as she's just one-dimensionally dour. This he is just not into it at all.
B00005YU1O|3.0|I read a lot about lucid dreaming, etc. but this movie sucked.  The motion of the picture makes you feel nautious, like seasickness.  The story line is pretty lame, and annoying.  It was a poorly executed idea, at best.
B005I6EU48|1.0|I had the original Kindle with a lovely real leather cover and a pocket inside.  When I got my Kindle Fire, I expected to get a high quality cover.  When I received this one, I was very disappointed.  First, the cardboard was warped and the cover is very thin and there is only a very slight opening to slide a couple of notes into.  It does not claim to be leather but it has a cheap simulated leather-look cover.  It certainly is not worth the money and I am looking for another one to replace it.
0385535139|3.0|Extolling the beauty of character attorney Nadine Karros at every turn got to be nauseating and very unlike a Grisham character. Grisham's appeal to me throughout his career is depicting the everyday man. It was off-putting to continually be bombarded with Ms Karros's beauty, intelligence, wit, cunning, style, figure, savvy, etc. Im a huge Grisham fan, read ALL his previous books but this is now my second mediocre review. Just too simplistic. Especially for Grisham. Its not bad, just so average. I didn't have to anxiously wait a whole year for this, Grisham's annual release. Any non famous author delivers this type of effort year round. Nevertheless, still no one tops Grisham's wry humor. That is what keeps him ahead of the pack even with sub-par outings such as the Litigators. Hoping next release will have a much more sophisticated plot.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I took some other people's advice and ordered this through amazon.co.uk - for a lot less then its selling in the states. It takes longer to get here...I think it took over two weeks and to be honest I was starting to worry. But it came today so all is well. I hear a better box set is coming out. This doesn't surprise me. Something better is always coming out. For what is out right now, this is great. By buying from UK - you save money and get the complete set. Pretty good deal.
B000JML7EC|5.0|I have to confess...I never read this as a child and I'm shocked that I didn't.  I did read Pirate Brig which is why I probably sail today...smile...  This came up on my phone for free so I decided to kill some time to read it; absolutey captured me and took me hostage even though I had a pretty good idea what the end was going to be after so many \\"versions\\" of the plot in cartoons etc over the years.  Still a great book to read and a must read for every boy.
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|All 3 books, show no matter where you came from you can make a different in the world. WoW. Great for any age!
0439023521|4.0|I liked the idea of a Post USA - the way it began sucked you in and made you want to get more into the book. Excellent job of getting you to feel the main character even though she was far removed from anything we would relate to in real life. I wish we were as impelled to read happy books as we are to read this type of dark feeling but it is the real way we get intrigued.
B0064J6OMO|4.0|The main idea of the plot has been done many times before with movies like freaky friday, 17 again, and many others. Now that the ovious is out of the way, my wife and I thought this was a funny movie. There were lots of situations you live as a parent show in this movie with a comic twist.
B006L15THG|4.0|i love this show and I missed 2 so I can watch them hear pretty cheap with outh having to mis story lines before the next show or waiting who know how long for reruns
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I like Search &amp; Finds to begin with,  but it's great that it's like a plot video game at the same time.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This CPU cooler does an excellent job in cooling my AMD Phenom processor at stock and moderate overclocked speeds. With the stock single fan, the CPU would run at 40-42 degrees C for hours on end. When I added a second fan in the supplied clips to increase the cooling, I can run at 25% overclock on the CPU and stay at 39 degrees C without seeing the temperature rise on the temperature monitor for the CPU.<br /><br />One note is that you should pay attention to the direction of air flow before installing this fan as that can impact the way you orient the fan for the most efficient cooling.
0060873027|2.0|I have to say that I was really disappointed with this book.  I listened to the audio while driving a long road trip. It was boring, unlike other books.  I expected a bioterrorism type book, not some book that steals the plot of honey I shrunk the kids...
B0066W1AZK|3.0|This chess game is amazing. sooooo pretty on the kindle fire. I re commend this game;) I wish there was a number on difficulty..... Other than that it's. amazing
1400062756|5.0|Just purchased and am very impressed with the premise of this book in that hard work and effort mean so much.  The author Carol Dweck has really captured something we all need to know and teach our family, co-workers and friends.  I plan to use this book in my personal life and also assist my business relationships grow.  Easy read, simply written for everyone's ability with real world examples!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This movie absolutely wowed me.  Maybe it's because I had low expectations going into it, but I absolutely loved it.  I did not know much about Queen Victoria but this movie made me want to learn more about her.  The love story between her and Albert is fantastic and makes me believe in love again!
1419702238|5.0|I have found all the Wimpy Kid books to be very delightful.  My great grandson loves them and will sit for a long time reading.  Greg just seems to get into all the situations that a lot of children encounter in Jr. High.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I think this is a great version of Jane Eyre.  It's been a long time since I read the book but I felt like a lot was left out.  Of course, the book is very long and there is no way everything could have fit into a 90 minute movie.  However, the movie is great and I really like how they bounced back and forth between past, present and future.  Sometimes it felt like the movie moved way too fast and their relationship progressed too quickly.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I have truly enjoyed the Big Bang Theory.. The fourth season is no different.. I believe that the Big Bang Theory is one of the best sitcoms on television today..possibly even one of the best ones for a really long time..
B00364K6YW|5.0|I have always loved this version of Pride & Prejudice.  It is a great movie that sticks fairly close to the book.  If you love Jane Austen then you will love this movie!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Fast forward some parts - amazing filmaking = few films are so crafted as quentin tarintinos. TY QT One of my fav flicks.
B006C45MRE|2.0|While watching this movie my computer showed a full connection but the picture quality was terrible. I am just about over trying to use Amazon instant video. Most of the time i will show a full connection with my modem but the amazon videos will say i have a poor connection. It is very frustrating.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was looking for a simple version of solitaire. This fits the bill. A thoroughly enjoyable way to pass some down time.
B004Z4LVZK|5.0|My book arrived in perfect shape, read it, loved it! Don't pay too much attention to the negative comments about this book, some people are just harsh critics. I thought it was really well written, the plot was great, the suspense kept me on edge. If you're looking at this book because you read the \\"hunger games\\" you've found the perfect book. Its similar in lot of ways but then its not. Can't wait to read part 2, im sooo excited! I think the author is an absolute genius. Get this book, trust me you won't regret it!
B0013ND30M|5.0|The item arrived quickly even though it was ordered during the holiday season.  It was nice to not have to wait and worry about it arriving before Christmas.
B00000J9HE|5.0|Karajan's style suits Sibelius's work - Smooth, stylized and sophisticated sound. Karajan had the ability to remove the human element from music. This may not work with his Beethoven symphony cycle, but it works here. Sibelius music feels like being in an alien land, where no human is present. The sanitizing effect of Karajan - music polished to the degree that music feels devoid of human presence, is uncannily just the correct mood for the Sibelius effect.  This is also one of the better recordings of Karajan recording soundwise. I find that Karajan's records during his late recording years tend to be shrill with the kind of digital recording technology (probably new at that time) that was employed by Deutsche Grammaphon. I also hear Karajan used to have artistic license over manipulating the acoustic engineering of the DG digital recordings. His Beethoven cycle has this shrill metallic over-amped treble high quality. But this recording is so much more wholesome. The art of Karajan's conducting style shines through with Sibelius which make this CD set great; on top of that the sound quality is so good it is like a blue ray for the ears.    Coming to Sibelius as a composer - there is so much invention in themes. They are so unique that you cannot peg a particular theme as folksy. You cannot brand the musical motifs because the phrases come and go, on a wave of breakthrough musical ideas. Some phrases live short and are gone, but the lasting sound of that tune or theme still lingers - as something mysterious which you cannot put your finger on. I had to listen to this 2 CD set four times to get some form of comprehension of the symphonies as a whole to satisfy the musical completeness of these symphonies in my mind; there are simply so many musical ideas bubbling through. The individual themes and phrases are like different cracks in the icy landscape and you need to zoom out and see the whole network of icy formation which is made of thatches of all these individual icy musical strokes. The Sibelius symphonies to me are unlike symphonies by other composers; to me they are large tone poems which paint musical pictures of icy lands where there is no human or animal. An inert place and unknown place, which no one knows about and no one will discover. It could well be the icy planet Europa or an icy planet outside our galaxy. All 4 symphonies in this 2 CD set (symphonies 4, 5, 6 and 7) as well as the two tone poems - The swan of Tuoneloa  and Tapiola are wonderfully played. Which symphony is dear to someone is a subjective decision of the listener. Personally of all the four symphonies - the fifth symphony touches me the most...so if I may digress on this symphony...  Symphony 5 - This symphony written in 1915, revised by Sibelius again in 1916 and then once more in 1919 is an absolute gem. The first two movements bridge as one piece without a break (I did not even notice the movement had changed) and the intensity that builds in the last 5 minutes of the 2nd movement is uplifitng grandeur. The third movement's opening pizzicato theme is used as a recurring motif throughout this movement and keeps appearing in the movement as variations of the original iteration (as in the opening of the movement) - propelling the theme forward, and transforming it into new passages for solo instruments and orchestra with the undercurrent of the original pizzicato theme in the strings and orchestra. The repetitions of this theme are delicately balanced and innovatively modified for several instruments - not sounding banal or repetetive during any iteration. The last movement opens with a swirling cyclic circulating rhythm in the strings (feel traces of Beethoven's Eroica?) and transitions to an underlying brass theme which forms the bedrock over which is presented a second major theme in counterpoint. Then we have transformations of the first swirling theme - moving to elegiac passages in between; There are so many mood shifts in this movement from the nervous fervent to the peaceful-all-knowing mood. These mood changes make this work a delight to listen to. When I listen to this symphony, I feel like I am on an alien planet in a different galaxy where no other human exists and I am all alone. The music is devoid of human relativity.  This 2 CD set is a 5 star purchase hands-down. The characteristic - Devoid of human connectivity or human relativity - is the key to why Karajan and Sibelius go hand in hand; Sibelius composed that way, Karajan conducted that way.
B0055SWM08|4.0|fun game. to play with very nice music. pretty tricky. at times. but a good time occupier.  I am enjoying. I am very much.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I'm 51, but like many adults, I loved both the books and the movies. I finally got around to purchasing the entire set. I can watch at my leisure now, whenever I want to. Harry Potter is another great bit of Fantasy that a person can \\"immerse\\" himself in. I can imagine myself in Snapes' roll, or Harrys', or Hermiones'. I'll have a Harry Marathon one day soon. I hope \\"The Gang\\" is all doing well. Merry Christmas! It's good to see the youngsters grow into prosperous young adults. Especially Emma.

B004WJREPO|4.0|Paul McCartney's 1980 album MCCARTNEY TWO is such a terrible record that it was a number 1 album.  Equally unsuccessful is its single, &#34;Coming Up,&#34; which also went to number 1.  It must be that music fans are sick of McCartney's silly love songs, as MCCARTNEY TWO's eleven selections makes us suffer through a grand total of one song about love, &#34;Waterfalls.&#34;  Or could it be that McCartney never does anything different?  I keep mistaking &#34;Temporary Secretary&#34; for &#34;Yesterday.&#34;<br /><br />I've owned my vinyl copy of MCCARTNEY TWO since the album's 1980 release and have always caught some grooves to songs such as &#34;Summer's Day Song,&#34; &#34;Bogey Music,&#34; &#34;Dark Room,&#34; and &#34;Frozen Jap&#34; when it is on my turntable - I listened to MCCARTNEY TWO just a few weeks ago before finding this 2011 double-C.D. reissue at the public library.  First spin, bonus tracks &#34;Blue Sway,&#34; &#34;Mr. H Atom&#34; and &#34;All You Horse Riders&#34; make me realize Paul McCartney is so amazingly talented, 99.9% of all musicians would love to do something as good as his rejects.<br /><br />But I bought MCCARTNEY TWO in 1980.  I don't need two copies, even if the second has songs I only have on 45s and even some new music.<br /><br />My request to Paul McCartney:  Release a C.D. set of all your songs that were not on the original versions of your albums.  Just as I am not purchasing this latest version, I did not buy the 1993 C.D. reissue of MCCARTNEY TWO just so I could have &#34;Goodnight Tonight,&#34; &#34;Check My Machine&#34; and &#34;Secret Friend&#34; on a long-player.  But I would pay for a complete C.D. collection of all your music that was not on your albums when you first put it out.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Having looked over the reviews already posted, I need to say up front...this is a work for all wordsmiths to admire.  His characters are crafted so well you can literally almost smell them.  His intense detail is honest and honed to the core.<br /><br />The book is no ordinary thing with a predictable plot line or a quick resolution. Like fine writers of any era and any culture, he writes with all of himself, emotions, mind and full-bodied understanding of the violence of the world in the hands of pure evil. These characters will haunt you, will pain you, occasionally make you grimace or burst out laughing.<br /><br />He takes his time and you may be inclined to hurry, ala a Patterson mystery, for instance.  Not here will you find speed only.  When this plot moves, it is tornado-like and you do not, repeat do not, know where you will end up..It's a joy every step of the way.  I can't wait to pick up the next one as I bought them without any knowledge of the gift I was giving myself.<br /><br />Hope Carter
B002C6A6N6|5.0|With all due respect to everyone else who has had issues with the dvds' or the packaging.  I'm not sure if something has changed since then but the dvds' I received are flawless, audio and video is spot on time and time again.  Each season has it's own good quality dvd case, and on the inside of each case the dvds' are on a good quality holder that flips over to the next dvd in the season.  All of the seasons plus the two movies come in a thick quality dr. quinn tv show designed \\"card board\\".  Just the thick type of holder that holds all the seasons and the two movies and the front of that is open.  So mine didn't have the leather strap that a lot of other people are talking about.  Have had no issues at all with any of the dvds' either.
1400069181|4.0|Rapidly evolving technology and the societal imperative for immediacy bombard us almost daily with the message that more is better, whether that \\"more\\" is data, possessions, or choices. If at times we adults feel overwhelmed, imagine the cognitive load of this messaging on teenagers.<br /><br />As a parent who works with adolescents, I see, hear and feel what those pressures can be like for youth who are working through the basic challenges of transitioning from childhood to autonomy and self-sufficiency. Thus, I read Blake Mycoskie's book with the hope of hearing two voices that would resonate across generations, that of entrepreneur and that of pathfinder.<br /><br />Mycoskie's business insight and model have a simple elegance that is easy to downplay but that actually is at the heart of their appeal and long-term sustainability and adaptability. What makes this book and his work luminous, however, is the implicit message that each person can make a difference.<br /><br />Start humbly, simply -- with hope and belief and persistence. Persevere. Be an agent for positive change.<br /><br />These concepts are not original, but neither are they as integral in our lives as they could be. As a person who has tried to live by these principles, reading and re-reading Mycoskie's words has been a happy affirmation. As one who strives to help our youth empower themselves, I anticipate that sharing Mycoskie's story will add tangible credibility and depth, making this message resonate with young adults.

0670022950|5.0|Pinker's latest should be on everyone's short list of the Best Books of 2011.<br /><br />I'll admit to bias here: I'm a big fan of Steven Pinker's previous work, especially \\"The Language Instinct,\\" \\"How the Mind Works,\\" \\"The Blank Slate\\" and \\"The Stuff of Thought.\\" \\"How the Mind Works\\" is, in my opinion, the best single volume on this topic that currently exists.<br /><br />For a proposition that seems counter-intuitive in today's media saturated world, Pinker marshals an impressive array of charts and data to support his case. In brief, he shows us how the world of the past was much worse in real terms as far as violence and destruction are concerned and the overall trend over the centuries is towards less killing and maiming.<br /><br />As lousy as reality TV is today, it is certainly less violent than some of the entertainment popular in Shakespeare's day: like bear-baiting and watching live cats burn to death.<br /><br />The negative reviews here don't seem to be responding to the text of the book as I understand it, and include ridiculous ad hominem attacks. Pinker is certainly not \\"famous for being famous\\" like the Kardashians. And it is absurd to label him \\"lazy,\\" \\"insane\\" or \\"stupid.\\"  The phrase \\"to condemn much is to understand little\\" certainly applies here.<br /><br />However, near the end of the book I came across something that struck me as, well, wrong. In a section on the rise of IQ as measured by testing - the Flynn Effect - Pinker gives an example that doesn't fit with my understanding of economics. Here it is:<br /><br />\\"A community is located in a region where very little drinking water is available. In order to manage their water resources, which of the following should the community NOT do?<br /><br />  A. Increase their water usage.<br />  B. Buy water from another community.<br />  C. Install water-saving devices in homes.<br />  D. Charge higher rates for water.<br /><br />Anyone who understands the phrase 'law of supply and demand' realizes that D cannot be the correct answer.\\"<br /><br />D cannot be the correct answer? Well, take the example of another liquid commodity, gasoline. When prices rise, consumption falls and people seek alternatives: public transit, higher fuel efficiency vehicles, car-pooling, etc.<br /><br />It seems to me the one thing this community should try NOT to do, is A. Increase their water usage.<br /><br />Or am I missing something fundamental here?<br /><br />Please note that this is a minor quibble in a book that is a soaring achievement, in my view.example of another liquid commodity, gasoline.

B0052VUNHC|4.0|Imagine you're driving down the highway and notice a car driving the wrong way straight toward another car. That car swerves to avoid the idiot on the wrong side, but then a couch falls off of a truck and they hit it. Then the car flips over, does some somersaults, and gets hit by an oncoming vehicle. Then it bursts into flames.^ You're wondering, \\"what the hell just happened?!\\" First of all, you probably pulled over and are the worst type of gawker. Secondly, you just had an experience similar to reading Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />From the very beginning I wasn't sure if I wanted Abby and Travis to get together. He's sexy, tattooed, and happens to be a genius. She wears cardigans, sucks at Biology, and likes chocolate syrup in her oatmeal. There was no way I could see these two in the same social circle, let alone being bestest friends turned lovers gone wrong. Plus Abby was either completely dense or pretending to be for most of the book in order to not see how much Travis was in love with her. Then we learn about her \\"shocking\\" secret and...it's kind of lame, and seems to only partially explain her behavior. But it's unique and helps contribute to the insane drama. So much drama that those two almost gave me whiplash.<br /><br />^Accident scenario provided by Flowers in the Attic by V.C. Andrews.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I enjoy this movie.  I can watch this a few times a year and I still like the special effects of this movie.  Hugh Jackman plays \\"Van Helsing\\" a monster bounty hunter.  This movie is based on the comic story \\"Van Helsing\\" which I haven't read yet.  Kate Beckinsale is a \\"tough\\" queen of the gypsy's who is the last of her family.  The rest are stuck in purgatory.  She and Van Helsing go against Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) who is a great old-fashioned style Vampire with a great accent.  Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) becomes an ally of Van Helsing and they must stop Dracula and his brides from unleashing their \\"unholy) brood!  I wont get into the rest of the details though.  This is an \\"old fashioned\\" monster movie that has today's special effects that enhance this movie.  Alot of critics and \\"self-proclaimed\\" critics panned this movie.  They need to lighten up and just enjoy this movie for what it its.  Good fun and exciting scenes that any horror fan can enjoy.  Don't take this movie seriously because the actors don't.  They look like they had alot of fun making it (look at the extras of the DVD).  Highly Recommended!
0545265355|5.0|I simply loved these books, they are very catching and I literally couldn't stop myself from reading. I read all 3 of them in about 4 days. Amazing books, I highly recommend them. And plus, there's the movie coming soon so you better read them before the movie comes out!
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Great video movie for the whole family!!  We have already watched it 3 times and will see it again over the coming holiday season!!
B000002HO3|5.0|This CD is one of my very best CDs; period.  An outstanding assortment of outstaanding music from an outstanding artist.  If you don't like this CD, you don't have an ear for excellent music.  This is a must have album.
B004EPYZSU|1.0|I got this movie as a pre-Christmas gift.  I have not watched it yet but felt obliged to add another negative comment about Ultraviolet.  I wish they would stop using the term \\"Digital Copy\\" on these movies.  In order to receive the digital copy, you have to go through dozens of steps, download about 3 different programs and sign up for several different accounts.  I didn't even try doing this with this movie after a horrible Ultraviolet experience a couple weeks ago.  I'll review the movie after I watch it, I just wanted to blast Ultraviolet.  UPDATE  I finally watched the movie and it's pretty good.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.  I'm not going to change my rating until they do away with ultraviolet, however.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Friends with Benefits is a great romantic comedy that stars the talented and funny Justin Timberlake and equally funny and beautiful Mila Kunis. Usually romantic comedies are ...well romantic comedy's, nothing new, gets the job done. However, I have found myself paying more attention with this movie for some reason. Unlike \\"No Strings Attached\\" which came out 6 monthes prior to this movie, this movie actually had heart-felt moments that have been absent in romantic comedies lately (especially in 2011). The chemistry between Timberlake and Kunis was undeniably the highpoint of film, the interraction between these two is good enough to carry the film on its own, regardless of the plot, thats how good they go together. I love this movie that I can find myself watching it numerous times on ocassion. Even if the ending will be predictable, its the journey that was such a pleasure to watch.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Do i want a book that calls for genocide, slavery, rape, child abuse, and sensless murder on my phone? No thank you! The only reason to read this book is to make yourself aware of the horrible morals set forth in it so as to abolish it from popular culture.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|A great app to have if you own a tablet. This was great for my Acer Iconia Tablet because it already came with a trial Documents to Go (though of course it is easy enough to download). I don't know how robust the spreadsheet is since I do not need it, but the word processor gets the job done. Great since you could easily plug in any pc usb keyboard into the iconia and start working.

B0057R5XRG|3.0|The first film had few grain issues and the colour tones kept changing but towards the middle the film settles in fine. The T Rex,rain and chase is an amazing piece of film making.<br />The Lost World is pretty bad picture quality. I remember seeing it in the cinema and it had a certain look which today is dated. More over the night attack scenes between the two T rex and trailer is visually disappointing.<br />Part three fares much better and I actually love the look of the dinosaurs.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed the dvd and cd. Adele is great! The only thing that I wish Amazon made clearer is that there is a lot of swearing on the dvd. She drops THE F word several times when talking to the audience as well as several other colorful phrases. We don't mind... but I am guessing that some parents of younger children might object.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case is protective - granted it's not an \\"Otterbox\\" but I didn't want a bulky phone. It has to fit into my purse and pockets -- and it does!

I would recommend this for an adult who takes care of their phone and is not careless with it.
B004TRJRD6|5.0|Little by little I have been replacing my rather large Laser-Disc collection of movies with DVD's.

B005FLX2WC|5.0|Thanks to Amazon's recommendation I first listened to samples, then immediately purchased this absolutely astonishing album. I cannot imagine anyone, other than Etta herself (my all-time favorite vocalist), delivering a better rendition of 'I'd Rather Go Blind'. I was simply blown away (and continue to be each and every time I hear it). This is definitely the best album of 2011. Obviously Ms Hart is an adoring student of the great Etta James in style and substance (at least with this outing). 'I'll Take Care of You' will melt your socks with it's soulful heat and Joe Bonamassa rifts. 'Sinners Prayer' is the perfect intro track, demanding your immediate attention and preparing you for what's to come. The beautiful, aching 'Ain't No Way' as the final track leaves you gasping and wanting more. Just can't lavish enough praise on these artists. My only criticism is there are only 10 tracks. I'm ready for the next installment from this dynamic duo... sooner rather than later, please.

Some great songs on this though. \\"Peacemaker\\",\\"Thrown Down\\" and the gorgeous \\"illume\\" being my favorites. My only complaint..I hate to say it, but it's too much. Too many songs. They seem crowded. It's like Lyndsey and Stevie each made a solo album and combined them. They could have saved some of the songs for later Mac or solo releases. Good listen though.

B002G1YPH0|4.0|What the title said. That, and the installation is difficult for someone with no heatsink/fan experience. The instructions were also hard to follow. Not for the novice builder, but it performs well. Keeps my CPU below 50C at all times (that's while playing bf3, black ops, and napoleon total war).
B005CVWWJY|1.0|All credit to the author, I couldn't do a better job writing a novel, I also love John Hughes and the premise is interesting, but top 20 of the year? That's an eye opener. It reads like a high school essay cover to cover, \\"when I say essay, I mean, essay...\\" (The Breakfast Club 1885.) This is my first time reviewing a book which probably goes to show how underwhelming my OASIS experience was.  I \\"Wade'd\\" (get it) through this book cringing.   Seriously, it's about as well written as this review.
0307959856|3.0|I'm an Austen fanatic and can quote whole paragraphs of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by heart, so I was really looking forward to enjoying this book.  Imagine my disappointment that such a good writer as P. D. James came up with such a mediocre work.  I'm not going to re-hash the plot here, that's all been done in other reviews.  But this book adds nothing to the Austen canon.  The whole whodunit is silly in the extreme, P. D. James tries and fails at making Wickham capable of rehabilitation, and various characters from \\"Emma\\" and \\"Persuasion\\" are inserted into this book to little or no effect.  If you're faced with the prospect of a boring afternoon and have absolutely nothing else to read you might give this book a shot, but you'll be looking for the ending long before the ending finally arrives.<br /><br />Judy Lind
B0060AY6FO|4.0|Since I am a senior, it has been many years since I have read the original P & P, I am going to go back and re-read P&P.  That way I can write a review that is more current.  Please forgive me for suggesting that our memories sometimes smudge or idea of what went on in the earlier years.  Of course the book was both wonderful and interesting.  Just reading further into the lives of beloved characters was a gift.  Enjoy!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this. It was a real page turner and fun read.  I am a full grown adult reading this book so I had to keep in mind that the love story in it had to be a little.. unrealistic, I guess.   Overall its a great dystopian story involving young adults.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|great product,will fit in my purse for travelling and I love the color. Fits the Kindle just right and is slightly padded to protect it.
B004OT8HJO|4.0|Grandson loves this Lego toy. Has kept him busy and happy for days and days. Perfect fit for a seven year old.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|I didnt catch this one at the theater, unless they are those \\"movie theater movies\\", I can't justify spending $12 for the big screen.  For the action effect, this one may have been good enough for a matinee movie watch.  I caught some of this at a friends house w/o knowing much about it. It has a nice looking group of people cast, who I think did a good job for their roles.  Yeah, some of it was predictable, but I think it was worth the 2 hrs you will set aside for it.  The violence, mostly action scenes are not gory, there isn't much bad language. Parents if your kids are under 11 or 12, i'd just say you watch it first, to see how much shooting and stuff you want your kids exposed to.  The romance is cute, like I said, predictable, but not cheesy.  The movie seems to set itself up for at least one sequel, which I would not mind seeing, so I hope they are able to make that happen. Diana (from Glee)did a nice job, and the main guy is a looker, so he's nice to watch  :-)  The flow of the movie seems to stand and it doesnt seem to have many parts that drag on, so for what it's worth, go for it.  Redbox currently has it available (december 2011), so shell out $1 if you reserve it online first, and then decide if you want to buy it.  It's a good rainy or snowy day movie that would be fun to watch with a group, as since it's not a terribly deep plotted movie, you can chat among your friends when the movie is on and not miss too much.  I enjoyed it, not a 5 star, but I'll give it 4, for being just a good flick.  try it out!

B0051MKNV8|4.0|Limitless uses an interesting concept you've probably have seen before: Is there a cure all for our limitations, an \\"easy button\\" for life?. For Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), this comes in the form of NZT, a pill that is designed to enhance a person's cognitive abilities and focus.  Eddie, a failed writer, sees that the possibilities are infinite, as he can become twice the writer he was, and has a newfound mental power that enables him to react to all life's dilemmas. Limitless takes this premise and runs with it, making it a quick-paced, thrilling ride, putting you right in Eddie Morra's world.     The director uses both visual effects and quick-paced action along with an engaging script to come up with a film that works and keeps you glued to the screen. Eddie, an antihero or sorts, is a likable loser who drinks too much and has trouble finding jobs, the ability the write, or finding his place in life.  When he begins taking NZT, the positive results are instantaneous--he writes a book in a few days, he plays and wins at the stock market, he impresses his ex-girlfriend, he feels a newfound success. However, as you could probably guess, as things are going too good for Eddie, that things will eventually blow up in his face. He realizes that there are scary side effects and a dark nature to NZT, and that former users have had mysterious and sometimes violent ends. Things really take off as Eddie tries to figure out his world and the effects of the drug amid the chaos of being pursued by thugs.   While Limitless does many things well, the ending, in my opinion, was a bit too safe, anticlimactic and tidy, and it's probably the weakest part of an otherwise engrossing film. It's the kind of ending that doesn't really leave much of an impression, rendering the resolution typical and predictable, when it could have been more memorable. Still, Limitless is an exciting experience, an action film with an interesting look at the benefits and negatives of \\"artificial\\" intelligence in the form of a pill.
0385344325|5.0|A MUST READ for all Jack Reacher fans. This is where it all started and it makes me want to line up my collection and reread from there on.
B000A2UBN4|5.0|This is a dark movie, and be sure to watch the second DVD that shows how difficult the movie was  to make---It was shot with quite a bit of difficulty.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|A fantasy for sure - perfect for a feel-good movie night at home, especially at Christmas.  It is fast becoming a Christmas tradition at our house.  It is exactly what it set out to be. I think many of the negative reviewers want the movie to be something else altogether.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I bought one of these in the hope of better fidelity when listening to my iPod.  I use this product with the FiiO L3 line out dock that plugs into the 30 pin connector on my iPod touch.  Tighter bass, better vocals and much better detail.  The difference between this combo and the standard headphone jack is immediate, obvious, and clearly worth the $40 investment.<br /><br />In fact, it sounds so good that I ditched the clunky DAC/headphone amp/Airport Express combo I was using on my nightstand.  Sold all the stuff for hundreds on Ebay because I couldn't tell the difference between that setup and this cheap $30 amp (and I'm quite an experienced listener, trust me).<br /><br />UPDATE:  MARCH 2013<br /><br />I've now gone through two of these things.  They might sound great and they're pretty cheap, but don't count on them lasting very long.  After about six months of use the input jack develops a real scratchy sound and sometimes the sound will disappear in one ear unless I twist the cord a little.  No, it's not the cord.  But the situation worsens over time to the point where the unit is simply too aggravating to use.  I won't be buying a third.<br /><br />Also, I've noticed that it helps some headphones more than others, and some source units more than others.  For instance, it drastically improves sound on my iPod shuffle but doesn't do much to help the sound on my Samsung Galaxy 3, which must have a good amplifier built in.  Similarly, it helps drive my Bose QC15 noise cancelling headphones but doesn't help my Bose earbuds a whole lot, probably because they're easier to drive.
B000068R1X|5.0|I'm going to say it, next to No More Tears, this is my second favorite Ozzy album.  Mainly because while the previous 2 are fantastic, they're generally the most highly thought of in his discography, and this being not quite as well known plays a part in that.  Also it's just a really freakin' good album.  This isn't a Randy Rhodes, nor a Black Sabbath album, but Ozzy manages again to prove the members of Black Sabbath were fools to get rid of him.  As with every 80's and 90's Ozzy album, this one has its own unique sound, yet still keeping in the hard rock style that is Ozzy.  This album is definitely an 80's album.  There are all sorts of keyboards in the mix, and the keyboard player does a great job, as does ne wguitarist Jake E Lee, who apparently hated his time working with Ozzy.  But I'm glad he worked with him, because we got this gem.  Plus the follow up had some great songs on it as well.  The version of this album I have is the 95 remaster which sounds perfect.  I've never heard any previous or latter version of the album although I did manage to get the new, at the time, tracks on the latter remasters, and the 1 for this album is solid.  There's a good mix of variety here.  You have plenty of heavier rockers, and faster songs, plus some softer ballads, and a few different little twists Ozzy would never use again.  This might be Ozzy's most diverse album ever.  Ozzy sounds great.  The musicians sound great, and everything comes together very nicely, except for So Tired.  Bark At The Moon 10/10 is a faster paced rocker, and a great way to start the album.  The opening riff is great.  I like the keyboards they use to fill in the song.  Ozzy's vocals are really good, and overall we're left with an Ozzy classic.  Also we get a decent solo.  You're No Different 10/10 very keyboard driven with drums and bass and Ozzy's vocals providing some solid verses, with guitar notes to fill things in.  I'd have preferred some more guitars in the chorus, but that's nitpicking.  Overall this is a great song, with a solid guitar solo as well.  Now You See It Now You Don't 9/10 is a mid tempo rocker with some keyboards thrown in.  There are plenty of solid guitar riffs to be found here.  Ozzy gives us some solid melodies, and everything just fits nicely.  Fantastic song.  Rock N'Roll Rebel 9/10 is another mid tempo rocker.  There's a great opening riff.  Ozzy sounds great.  I love the lyrics, like Ozzy shouting back at all the political nonsense going on in the 80's hating on rock and metal.  I don't know if that had happened at this point or not.  Centre Of Eternity 9/10 starts with a church bell and an organ, and moves into one of Ozzy's fastest songs ever.  This is a fast rocker, with great guitar work and vocal melodies.  It has a nice hook in the chorus, and everything just fits nicely together.  So Tired 2/10 is an awful song.  Well the song itself isn't too terrible, not particularly great, but not too bad.  Ozzy's vocals are fine, and the drums and bass are fin.  The guitar solo is decent, but the keyboards and piano are awful.  Oh man.  it's like he decided to do a parody of the 80's ballads, and managed to make something much worse than most of them.  How in the world did One Up The B Side and Spiders not make this album yet this stupid song did?  Must be a record company thing.  Slow Down 9/10 is an up tempo rocker.  The keyboards during the chorus sound very cheesy, and make me laugh, but they aren't enough to make me not like the song.  In fact that cheesiness kind of makes me like the song more.  Waiting For Darkness 10/10 starts slowly with a quiet keyboard intro that leads the guitars and drums in slowly.  There's a kind of cool guitar riff in the intro, and the keyboards are really cool.  There are a couple tempo changes, nothing drastic, in the verses, and the chorus.  This is a great song, and a great way to end, I'm guessing the original version of the album.  Spiders In The Night 5/10 is ok I guess.  It has a nice creepy sound to it, but overall it doesn't do a whole lot for me.  Overall despite 1 crappy song, this is an otherwise perfect release that should not be missed.  Just be prepared for a lot of keyboards and you'll be fine.  Unfortunately we wouldn't get another release of this caliber for nearly a decade, 91's No More Tears, which is my favorite Ozzy album.  Still don't miss this album.
0156711427|3.0|There is much to appreciate in Forster's exploration of two cultures in A Passage to India. To what extent can British and Indian people coexist when you factor in beliefs and values? Are there biases that we form against outsiders, either internal or external? Forster undoubtedly raises important issues about colonialism, and the efforts of two sides to respect each other, and for this I can see the literary value and relevance attached to his novel.<br /><br />Still, there was something lacking about this reading experience. Part of it was the characterization. The characters were not only flat and forgettable for the most part, but also were unsympathetic and rather annoying. I know that Forster, to an extent, gave each of these characters flaws, but some of the main characters seemingly lose their heads and collective reason at the most inopportune times. Aziz is a curious one: his bitterness towards the British knows no bounds, yet his has this bizarre compulsive adoration of Mrs. Moore after only having seen her two or three times. The only one that seemed to have any sense was Fielding. Another issue was the dry writing style. The way it is written you feel so disengaged from everything that is going on. You feel distant from the experience, and hardly sympathize or care for these characters, even when Aziz is trying to uphold his name after being falsely charged. There's moments where the narrative moves at a plodding pace, especially in part one. It's only in part two that things finally get going, with the trip to the caves and subsequent trial.<br /><br />Forster is able to finish the novel strong, and there are some wonderful and poetic descriptions of the landscape, the Marabar Caves and Chandrapore, however this was still a mediocre read. As this was my first Forster book, I'm still anxious to try another one from him. In the end, I can see the literary significance of A Passage to India, but maybe it's a bit overrated.

0439023513|3.0|The last book of of the Hunger Games was kind of a let down. The first two books were terrific, I couldn't put them down, but this last one, not so much. The ending was rushed, so much so that the last chapters are confusing and a disapointment. Katness finally starts going to war on page 255 and the book only has 390 pages in it. You've been expecting this war from book 2 and especially from third, and it is kind of a let down. If you have read the first 2 books my advice would be to wait for this book to go on sell, or borrow it form the library. It isn't one I would rush out to get.

If you use your Fire \\"naked\\" it is a nice snug fit.<br />The price just seems high to me for such a simple case.
B0000252YK|3.0|I'm very glad the legal issues surrounding this album weren't present back when I won all Ozzy's albums, from Blizard through Tears, off the radio, and they ended up being the 95 remasters as an added bonus.  I listened to all of Ozzy's classics, No More Tears, Blizzard of Oz, Diary Of A Madman, and Bark At The Moon, and even Ozmosis before I really started listening to this album.  The only one I hadn't listened to before this one was No Rest.  The first thing I noticed as I drudged through this album was that the songs aren't nearly as good as the songs on the previous mentioned albums, especially the first half.  The second half is actually quite good, and very redeeming for the album.  Still this album has an enjoyable mood and flow to it, and I really do like listening to it.  You can put it on and listen to it straight through, just don't expect many classics.  There are a few though.  The production is solid.  I like how each Ozzy album pretty much sounds different from the rest, although Scream sounds fairly similar to Black Rain.  But, at least the older albums have their own unique sounds to them.  Ozzy's voice sounds good.  The music also has a good sound.  I love the sound of the drums on this album.  They have a nearly thunderous sound to them.  The guitars sound great.  Jake E Lee is an underrated guitarist.  I can't speak for any other version of this album, don't believe there are any latter ones, but the 95 remaster sounds fantastic.  Also there isn't as much variety on here as previous, or future releases.  Most of the songs sound pretty similar, with a couple sounding the same.  The Ultimate Sin 7/10 starts off with a nice drum beat, and guitar riff.  This is kind of a groovy rocker.  It flows well enough, but there's something keeping this from being a really good song.  Still it's decent and worth a listen.   Secret Loser 7/10 is an up tempo rocker with a catchy yet simple chorus.  The vocals are pretty solid, and the riffs are well performed.This is probably one of the better songs on the album.  Never Know Why 6/10 flows well, but just isn't that great of a song.  The chorus is way too weak.  Still there's a nice tempo, and some good guitar work.  The verses are decent, they just needed a little more on teh chorus.  Thank God For The Bomb 8/10 has a simple chorus too, but it works for this song.  This is a faster paced rocker, and I like the energy it has.  There's some nice mix of clean and heavy guitars in the verses.    Never 6/10 has a similar tempo to most of the songs on here, well Never Know Why anyways.  And, they both have Never in the title.  This is my least favorite song on the album.  It's not bad, but it's nothing special either.    Lightning Strikes 9/10 is a mid tempo rocker with a very catchy chorus.  Nice use of keyboards in the chorus to add effect.  Some may find this song cheesy, and the lyrics kind of are, but I love it.  This song definitely sounds 80's, and not just because of the keys in the chorus.  Still a very good song.  Killer Of Giants 10/10 fantastic clean intro and acoustic first verse.  This song has a few changes in it, the second verse brings in the drums and bass.  The chorus is heavier.  This song has a great chorus, and solid verses.  Everyone shines on this beautiful song.  The song also picks up some speed during the instrumental break.  Fool Like You 6/10 is a decent song, but fits in better with the first half.  The verses are pretty decent, following the same tempo as the nevers.  There really isn't a chorus, kind of a build up to nothing, which I guess is the chorus.  Still it's listenable, but nothing special.      Shot In The Dark 10/10 ah the song I believe which sparked most of the problems with the album, and it's a great song.  It's the only one I knew when I first listened to the album.  It's kind of upper mid tempo, mostly softer.  There are some heavier riffs in the intro and chorus.  The vocal melodies are really good, and I love the chorus.  Thisis a solid way to end the album, though Killer Of Giants was more epic and would probably have made a better closer, but that's nitpicking.  Still this is an Ozzy classic in my book.  Overall this is a decent album every Ozzy fan should own, well those who can accept someone other than Randy Rhodes on guitars.  It's not his finest hour, but it's still a fairly consistent release, and a shame it's no longer being mass produced.  Seriously Ozzy get the legal stuff straightened out so it can be re-released.  Heck I read somewhere there is an unreleased song from these sessions which I'd love to hear.
B004132HZS|5.0|This was absolutely wonderful!! I took a chance and bought it because I love BBC and because of the reviews. Let me say right now I cannot have been more pleasantly surprised! This was awesome and Sherlock is a mad genius.  The banter between him and Watson is hilarious...although at one point it was a bit awkward for me and I came away wondering is Sherlock was a homosexual....but other than that, AWESOME!!! I'm so  psyched for Season Two!!!

B0001RVTXO|5.0|I really enjoy the Pixies and I believe they are one of the many unappreciated artists in the music world. Their style is unmistakable and has the perfect blend of alternative and hard rock sounds!
B000068QZK|3.0|From Blizard through Ozmosis, this was the last Ozzy studio album to hear.  And I saved the weakest for last.  It's still a decent album, better than some of his Post Ozmosis stuff.    The version I have is the 95 remaster, so I can't comment on any prior or latter version of this album, but the 95 remaster sounds great.  Seriously they really shouldn't have bothered redoing them, because the 95 remasters are where it's at.  Ozzy brings in Zakk Wylde to take over guitars, and he does a solid job here, as he would on all of Ozzy's releases.  The album has solid variety between faster rockers and mid tempo songs, and a ballad.  The production is very solid.  I really enjoy the sound of this album.  All of the instruments sound good, especially the guitars, and Ozzy's vocals sound great.  The problem is the songwriting is just so so, as it was for the most part on the previous album.  Still this is a decent album, and any Ozzy fan should own it.    My track ratings won't be in the actual order, but in the order I have them on my ipod.    Miracle Man 7/10 is an enjoyable track, fast paced rocker.  The guitar playing is solid, a nice way for Zakk to introduce himself to Ozzy fans.  The vocals are pretty good.  The chorus is a bit of a letdown, not terrible, and the robotic \\"Miracle man\\" does help make the simplicity of the chorus a little more interesting.  Devil's Daughter 8/10 is another faster paced rocker.  It's funny both Ozzy and Iomi put out songs with this title, Iomi changing his song title to something like Devil and daughter, because of Ozzy's, all in the same year.  This one has a little more to it than the previous song.  There's a pretty good build up to the chorus.  The chorus is still a bit of a let down.  But, the rest of the song makes up for that, and it's not bad either.  Breaking All The Rules 7/10 is a decent upper mid tempo rocker.  Nice riff in the verses.  Again the chorus is a little disappointing, but overall it's still a very solid song.  FireIn The Sky 9/10 is my favorite song on the album.  It starts with a keyboard and drum intro before a heavier riff.  The verses are acoustic, sound electric acoustic.  The chorus is solid, rare on this album.  Love the effect on the acoustic guitars.  I actually enjoy the lyrics.  Overall this is a solid Ozzy ballad, and one that's tragically overlooked by most people.  Hero 7/10 I think is a bonus track first added to the 95 remaster.  It's a mid tempo rocker which starts with a keyboard intro.  How this was left off the original in place of the rest of the songs I rate after this one is beyond me.  Bloodbath In Paradise 6/10 is an alright song, fast paced rocker.  It's ok, but there's really nothing special.  Demon Alcohol 6/10 is an up tempo rocker, and kind of blah.  The verses are decent, as is the build up to the chorus, but the chorus, again, falls flat a bit.  Stil it has a decent flow to it, and is listenable.  Crazy Babies 7/10 eh, I had to get use to the song title.  I found it kind of stupid actually, still do.  But the song itself is decent.  It probably has the second or third best chorus on the album, which isn't saying much.  It's a mid tempo rocker.  There's a nice main riff.  I can't get over Ozzy going \\"Crazy..  Babies..\\"  But whatever.  It's still 1 of the better songs on here.  Tattooed Dancer 6/10 is a fast paced rocker, with a decent riff in the verses.  But the song itself isn't anything special.  Somehow this song seems to consistently disappear from my computer, and I keep having to add it again.  Not sure what the deal is with that.  I'd give this song a 5, originally did, but I had to give it a point for Ozzy saying \\"dance for me b---h.\\"    So, overall this is an ok album.  It's probably worth adding, although it really doesn't have much staying power with me.  There are a few must haves for Ozzy fans, but overall get his other albums, from the 80's and 90's first.  Heck I prefer Black Rain to this one, and Scream is also way better.  Still it's worth owning.

B000063DFS|5.0|OK so I'll just say it.  I know Bark At The moon is a great album.  I know about the greatness of Randy Rhodes and Blizard Of Oz, and Diary Of A Madman.  All 3 will get perfect scores from me as well.  But, this is my absolute favorite Ozzy Osbourne album.  There, I said it.  Zakk Wylde is a very good guitarist, and the longest tenured guitarist for Ozzy, yet the albums he plays on are mostly ok at best.  Ozmosis is actually decent, but too many ballads, but overall the albums he played on just didn't cut it as whole albums.  Granted each had a few must have Ozzy classics.  I don't blame him for this.  His guitar playing was solid on each Ozzy album, it's just a shame his contributions were on mostly weaker albums.    This one, however, is a classic, and to date Ozzy's last real classic.  Everything worked well on this one.  The produciton was very solid.  I have the 95 remaster, so I can't speak for the 2000's remaster, but the version I have sounds fantastic.  Each instrument is easily heard.  Speaking of which, every member of the band plays great.  The stand out for me, and I identify with guitars, is Zakk Wylde's guitar playing.  He has a great sound on here, and his playing is equally good.  Pretty much every song has a great solo.  Ozzy's voice sounds awesome too, and his melodies are all very good too.  Overall this album has everything.  Great musicianship, vocals, vocal melodies, decent lyrics, good production, and a nice mix in terms of songs.  You'll have some rockers, some in between songs, and some beautiful ballads.  And, they're all mixed up perfectly, so there's no situation of having too many ballads all lumped together like on Ozmosis or a the latter Scorpions albums.    Mr. Tinkertrain 6/10 starts with some strange kiddy sounding music, and an audio clip of a bunch of kids.  Then we get a nice opening riff.  Musically and vocally the song is very solid, kind of upper mid tempo, softer verses that get heavier as it builds to the chorus.  Ozzy's vocals in the verses are creepy, which fits the akward subject matter of the song.  The lyrics are really the only thing dragging this song down, well the subject matter actually.  Ozzy seems to have written a song from the perspective of a pedofile.  Creepy..  Still a decent song, probably shouldn't have been the opening track though.  Zakk's solo is really good.   I Don't Want To Change The World 9/10 should have been the opener.  this is an up tempo rocker.  Solid vocals, solid guitar playing.  Great solo.  The melodies are also very nice.  Nice acoustic bridge.  Momma I'm Coming Home 9/10 beautiful acoustic ballad, with electric guitars filling in nicely.  Ozzy's melodies are great.  We get another fantastic guitar solo.  Overall an Ozzy classic.  Desire 10/10 is one of my favorite songs on the album.  This song probably has my favorite melodies.  It definitely has the best chorus, which is saying something because there are plenty of outstanding choruses on here.  I love the energy on here.  It's an up tempo rocker.    No More Tears 10/10 is the progressive epic of the album.  This is one of the first Ozzy songs I ever heard, and wow.  Great bass line to open the song, simple but effective, which brings the song to drums and keyboards, and some guitar licks.  The verses are mostly drum and bass and vocals with a heavy guitar riff to fill in between the vocal lines.  There's a solid build up to the chorus which is fairly simple, just the song title repeated, but it's done over great music, and with this echo effect and in such a way that it shines regardless.  I LOVE the slow down bridge part, not sure what a hand in the bush has anything to do with this song, but whatever.  It reminds me of some 80's movie in a real dramatic scene, with the guitar solo during the bridge.  This with Diary is one of Ozzy's most epic songs ever.  Sin 8/10 starts with a slofter intro before getting heavier.  This is a good example of why the epic of the album should be the last song,everything after seems to pale in comparison.  that being said this is a solid rocker.  The build up to the chorus would have been a decent chorus, but they come back with another god chorus later.  So for someone who loves a good chorus this is pure gold.  Unfortunately I really didn't remember this song that well, until now while I'm listening to it, but that doesn't change the fact that it is a very good song, and would be a stand out on any album that came after this one, or the 2 previous.  It's just an example of how good this album is that this song is kind of pushed to the background.  Still don't miss it because it is a very solid track.  Hellraiser 8/10 is more groove oriented.  The verses are mostly drum and bass and vocals, with some guitars as they get closer to the chorus.  Nice build up to the chorus.  Very nice chorus.  The vocals are the highlight for me on this track.  Overall a very solid track.  Of course we're also treated to another solid guitar solo.  This is definitely one of Zakk's best guitar performances, the album as a whole not just this song.  Time After Time 8/10 is a pretty good ballad, not as good as the first or the last ballad, but still pretty good.  The finger picking sounding guitar riff during the intro and verses is pretty cool.  Ozzy's vocals are decent as well.  I really like the part at the end of the instrumental break, after the solo, which of course the solo is good as well.  Zombie Stomp 8/10 is my least favorite song, and the 1 it took me forever to grow, but as you see the rating it's really grown on me.  The song starts with a decent bass line, and some guitars kick in shortly there after, as part of an extended intro, with some strange percussions.  Once the song actually kicks in we're treated to a solid riff.  The vocals are solid, even though I have no idea what Ozzy's talking about, still he sings it well.  This is an up tempo rocker.  Pretty dang good for the weakest song on the album.  A.V.H 10/10 starts withan acoustic bluesy riff, before erupting into a heavy fast paced rocker.  Love the drums on this one.  There's a nice mix of acoustic and electric during the build up to the chorus.  Very nice vocals as well.  Road To Nowhere 9/10 is a great ballad, and a solid way to end the album, though I'd prefer the title track be here, but whatever.  Very nice kind of bright clean guitar sound in the intro, which goes against the depressing nature of the lyrics.  Actually the whole music has a bright feel to it.  I love all the soloing.  Ozzy sounds fantastic as he does on every song on here.  Overall a very nice way to close out a very good album.  Overall this is an Ozzy Osbourne classic.  The songs are all fantastic, and this is one of those flawless albums, and one you can just put on and let play all the way through.

B004EPYZUS|5.0|Nonstop, edge-of-your-seat action, amazing stunts performed by Tom Cruise himself, whirlwind special effects. This definitely trumps the others in the Mission Impossible franchise. There wasn't much in the way of plot or spy-games/intrigue, but they made up for that by building more rapport with the team members and loading in more actions sequences. Very awesome film--well worth the money spent.

0811871258|3.0|To start, I have all of the work published by James Jean to date, except for Process Recess 2. I was greatly looking forward to this book, and foolishly ordered it on Amazon because they had it restocked before his website did, where I could have acquired a signed copy. If you would like your book signed, buy it from his website.  I was most looking forward to the illustrations Jean did for Prada, but was highly irritated by their presentation in this book. I am aware they are large and sprawling, but I figured it would turn into a large pullout (like Rift). Instead, it was hacked to pieces and put onto pages, where the flow was completely lost. In other illustrations the binding made it impossible to view the whole of the image, and in one of the Prada pictures in particular there is a figure sitting on a flower and the figure is 50% lost due to the binding.  In all, it is a wonderful collection of his work, but it could have done with 35% of them pullouts, at least, if you wanted to fully appreciate the composition.

When I got it I was let down. After hearing the first two tracks it seemed like we were getting the old Anthrax back.  Not so.  The rest of the album is considerably lighter.  Nevertheless, after MANY listenings (about 15) it started to grow on me and I appreciated it for what it is.  It's not \\"Amoung the living\\" or \\"Spreading the disease\\" but I'll take it.  Let's face it....the only one's who haven't softened with age are Slayer.

B0011U5E1S|4.0|Nirvana played painfully simple songs and had lyrics a twelve-year-old could pen, yet they are consistently lauded as the most influential grunge band ever. The collection here is a pristine example of what Nirvana should have been: obviously talented musicians who looked past simple chords and meaningless words towards what happens when a band pushes itself. Thus, the album warrants four out of five stars for being good, but not great. If one enjoys putting basic music on a pedestal, then one should buy everything Nirvana wrote. If one wants music that shows effort and leaves a lasting impact, one could even pick up the latest Foo Fighters records and find more substance there than here. Rolling Stone and Nirvana's legions, keep telling yourselves this band wrote the book on grunge and every other band following is a lame imitation. All that I need for proof of the band's lack of power is \\"In Bloom\\" or the handful of other bland sound-alikes the band penned.

It's the sort of story that haunts the reader long after it's over, and unlike the movie, the book makes sense.

B000FBGBPC|3.0|After writing a relatively loud - yet catchy - debut album, Three Days Grace either caved to label pressure or decided to write lazier, punch-less songs, it seems. The album is replete with boring riffs, trite lyrics and is exactly what elitists mean when they insult music like this.<br /><br />1. It's All Over - A promising start. Thunderous riffs, but cliched lyrics and strained vocals. Still a fairly strong tune. 8/10<br />2. Pain - ...And the wheels start to fall off. A bone-headed main riff, lousy vocals/lyrics and even an over-produced flute are all on display here. 5/10<br />3. Animal I Have Become - Outstanding bass work, and a decent riff, but the chorus' guitar work is dreadful. Liked the breathy interlude. 7/10<br />4. Never Too Late - Cheesy false-80's guitars, and the shouting/singing absolutely fails here. 5/10<br />5. On My Own - Liked the strummed acoustics in the intro, but the main riff is boring, and it's dragged down by simpleton lyrics. 5/10<br />6. Riot - Finally a real barn-burner. Tension-filled guitars explode into a great stoner-metal riff, and the breakdown shows great guitar skill. 10/10<br />7. Get Out Alive - As others have pointed out, the last great song on this album. Moody guitars and vocals give way to powerful start-stop riffs that take the song to a great conclusion. 10/10<br />8. Let It Die - As others have also pointed out, lame guitar work and echoed vocals make this a perfect fit for a mindless pseudo-ballad list. 6/10<br />9. Over and Over - Uninspired the entire way through. I am wasting no words on this lame ballad. 4/10<br />10. Time of Dying - Gontier again shows he can sing about tangible things. The riff is a back-breaker, too. 8/10<br />11. Gone Forever - Like the eighth track, this one tries to veer into Staind territory by hovering between a ballad and a rocker, and it falls flat on its face. 5/10<br />12. One-X - Guitars here show effort, but the track fails to hit because of its lack of energy. 6/10<br /><br />79/120 for a final score. A shame that this album was so monotonous and dull, because of the fire of its predecessor and the much-improved songwriting of its follower.and dull, because of the fire of its predecessor and the much-improved songwriting of its follower.

B005ER6SNM|5.0|This film takes a queue from Stanley Kubrick's classic film theme of man's inability to control his own destiny.  The film's main character Milos accepts a film offer which progressively gets more and more disturbing.  This movie pulls no punches and pushes all the boundaries of sex and violence, but not just for the sake of being shocking.  It truly is an excellent film, as long as one is not easily offended.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  Not only is it true to the feel of the novel (be prepared for some slight variations, but nothing too disturbing!!!), but it was WONDERFULLY shot.  There are all these really beautiful, quick shots of the countryside and little details that make the story more real--lovely!  The movie, like the book, is quite funny at parts (enter the ridiculous Bennett sisters and mother . . .) and entertaining as heck!  Finally, I just have to say, Matthew MacFadyen is my FAVORITE Mr. Darcy ever--he pulls off awkward-rich-guy very well and likeably from the very beginning, whereas other Mr. Darcies made me want to vomit, they're so arrogant.  And he's just adorable.  A+ movie and well worth the money!!!
B000W9DSVW|2.0|3 stars is for $ ONLY.  I got mine for $18 on Amazon.  IF this was the usual $30-$50, I would give it 1 star because of the quality of the transfer.  (For me) The first is my fav.  The second it seemed like they tried way too hard to make it confusing, and it didn't seem to really climax.  It was also plagued by over-performed acting.  The third I think they brought it back down to normalcy.  It neither had the complexity of the first nor the confusion of the second.  It was done straight.  You never asked how they did it. A bit of a snoozer though.  I forgot how disappointing the second and third movies were.  I am a huge fan of Soderbergh though and for $15 you can't complain!  Hidefdigest was right.  The first movie looks pretty good while the second 2 are awful. The picture never pops and the second 2 have so much grain it is ridiculous.  The last two movies look like dvd's.  It is like they literally took the video_ts files and put them on a blank dvd.   As for the audio, Dolby Digital 5.1 is all you get.  I kept cycling through my receiver and the BR menu looking for the TrueHD/DTS ma option.  Really?  Even Frosty the snowman on BR has True HD.  What's the deal?  If the first movie is pretty cheap on BR I would suggest picking it up and keeping your other 2 movies on DVD.  But, like I said before, $15 is not exactly breaking the bank either.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|At last, we get The Beach Boys' follow up to PET SOUNDS as a cohesive, finished work. At least, that's what Disk 1 of the set would like you to believe. Ultimately, however, this set, while precious and invaluable, just shows you how truly unfinished SMiLE always was, although Brian Wilson came tantalizing close to actually pulling the album off. Ultimately, the 2004 BRIAN WILSON PRESENTS SMiLE remains the definitive word on the album, and I intend to show you what I mean by that.  Before we get into the history and all the tangled details, let me just say this. Despite the incomplete nature of the recordings, it is truly amazing to hear The Beach Boys' SMiLE and how endlessly inventive and truly daring Wilson had became during the year period of late 1966 into 1967. The work is amazing, and stands head and shoulders taller than anything has that is currently out there in today's current market. If you love music and you want to be amazed, you owe it to yourself and to Wilson to hear this material (both the 2011 Beach Boys version and the 2004 solo version). For the record, I do prefer SMiLE over SGT. PEPPER  As a set, Mark Linette (The Beach Boys' main engineer for the last twenty years and overseeing their archiving project which has been going on for the last twenty years), with the consent of the band, has fully presented the \\"what might have been album\\" and all the various sessions in masterful sonic quality. Linette and his team really outdid themselves and the `finished' project sounds great.  For casual fans, the two disk set will suffice, as the second disk provides highlights of the various sessions. For those looking to dive headlong into the lore of the project should opt for the five disk set along with all the packaging and vinyl disks. However, be aware the four disks of sessions outtakes are exactly that. Much of the session tapes are Wilson talking to the backing band (Phil Spector's Wrecking Crew) working on getting the right sound. In contrast toall the stories and mythology that has grown up around the album, the session tapes reveal Brian in total control, very professional, and tightly focused on getting his vision down in sound, despite all the so called shenanigans that were going on.  A big appeal to SMiLE, and something that would be amiss if not mentioned, is the interactive nature and intellectual space the project has come to occupy. Just like Charles Dicken's \\"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\\", there have been literally hundreds of fan mixes of SMiLE , attemping to bring order to the fragments left behind. The most interesting of these are often pre 2004, as after 2004 most of the mixes modeled themselves after the 2004 version. With all the new material and sessions officially released, even with a Beach Boys version now sanctioned and in existence, hopefully the fan community will keep mixing and creating their own versions of SMiLE!  Then there is also the debate on what the 1967 version would actually have been. Simply put, there is no 1967 version, nor was the track sequence decided until 2004.There have been some voices complaining in the fan community about how the real SMiLE was the notorious 12 track list provided by Capital from an unknown source (thought to be Brian) and used on the 1967 album covers. However, when shown the list in 2006, Brian said he had never seen the list before. The chief speculation is the source was either Carl Wilson, or possibly Brian's sister-in-law, Diane Rovell.  Another big issue that has come up with this release has been the \\"three sided\\" SMiLE. The vinyl version has SMiLE divided into three sides, with the fourth side as bonus tracks, which the detractors say would never have been had the album been released in 1967. While it's true SMiLE would not have been configured that way back in the 1960s, the detractors are missing a key point - the album as it stands now is only 48 minutes long. The album could easily have been put on a single vinyl record. With theexception of Bob Dylan's first album, Dylan's five albums of the early to mid 1960s were all in the forty five to fifty minute range, with HIGHWAY 61 REVISTED clocking in at 51 minutes.  Throughout history, for various reasons (death, lack of interest, external pressure, perfectionism, etc), we have been left with unfinished art. These include Chaucer's THE CANTERBURY TALES, Dickens' THE MYSTERY OF EDWARD DROOD, Kafka's novels, Virgil's THE ANEID (which is only unfinished in a few minor places), etc.  As far the rock `canon', the most famous case of this is, naturally, The Beach Boys 1967 follow up to PET SOUNDS. The story is the stuff of legend. Brian Wilson scores a smash (though not commercially) with PET SOUNDS who influences everyone from The Beatles and George Martin on down. Where to go from there is the natural question. The answer: nowhere but up. Wilson was going to use the same recording techniques he pioneered with the 1966 single \\"Good Vibrations\\", recording short \\"feels\\" or \\"modules\\", and then literally constructing the album out of these feels with tapes and a razor blade (remember, this is 1966/1967 - no Pro Tools for these guys!) Over nine months (nice gestation number, that), Wilson does over 80 recording sessions, generally loses grip with reality in a drug fueled haze of LSD and amphetamine's, shelves the entire project and goes on strike, leaving The Beach Boys to issue the bizarre (even by 1967 standards) SMILELY SMILE. That's the official story anyway. Like any good myth, it's not quite accurate.  (I have even seen a website that argued SMiLE became SMILY SMILE. The argument on that website was largely based on the 12 track listing, which when you remove Brian Wilson's name from that list the whole argument on the website crumbles).   Given the unfinished nature of SMiLE, it is, perhaps, enlightening to compare this to another unfinished work, in this case J. R. R. Tolkien's THE SILMARILLION. The differences are more marked than the similarities between SMiLE and THE SILMARILLION; however, we can learn a thing or two by comparing them.  Tolkien began earnestly writing his legendarium in 1917 in the form of THE BOOK OF LOST TALES (though there are some scattered poems dating as early as 1914, and, according to Tolkien's letters, he began creating Arda, of which Middle-earth is a subregion or continent, as early as 1908). Tolkien worked on THE SILMARILLION his entire adult life, with the exception of a thirteen to fourteen year period between 1938 to 1951 when he was busy writing THE LORD OF THE RINGS. He died in 1973 at the age of eighty one, leaving behind a massive proliferation of manuscripts, all competing versions, for his son Christopher to sort through. And that's exactly what Christopher Tolkien did. He issued THE SILMARILLION in 1977, four years after Tolkien died.   In 1983 (not counting the 1979 book UNFINISHED TALES, whose success largely spurred the subsequent posthumous volumes), Christopher began his twelve volume THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH series, which he finished in 1996 with THE PEOPLES OF MIDDLE EARTH.  This is relevant to SMiLE and Brian Wilson in several ways. The first, and to this listener the most important, is that when THE SILMARILLION was finally published, it was done posthumously, because Tolkien, like Wilson, could not bring his work to completion. For serious readers, this brings serious questions of the validity of the published text as it relates to Tolkien's work. There are also serious questions of how canonical and authoritative is the 1977 SILMARILLION, as Tolkien was not alive to make the final decisions. Personally, I feel the published text would have been quite a bit longer had Tolkien lived to see his work to completion.   THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH only compounds the problem, as Christopher admits on numerous occasions that what he discerns as his father's most likely last intent on a given subject was not actually used in the 1977 text. For example, Findis and Irimë, who are daughters of King Finwe and sisters to Fingolfin, Finarfin, and half-sister to Feanor, do not appear in the published text, though they probably should have. Christopher also admits to writing most of Chapter 22 in the book, of which most of the essential features of the story have no real authority in the elder Tolkien's work at all.  SMiLE, on the other hand, has a completely different set of problems due to its' artistic medium - music. The first, and biggest problem, is that SMiLE, in its original incarnation, simply cannot be finished.   The reason why it cannot be finished? Because it can only be edited and configured, it cannot be added too. And SMiLE (meaning the 1966-67 Beach Boys sessions) desperately needs to be added too. Simply listening to the record reveals how truly incomplete and fragmented Brian left the album in late 1967.  The album is entirely too top heavy on instrumental, or primarily instrumental tracks. For all the love for The Beach Boys' vocals, honestly the vocal parts simply aren't as numerous or as frequent, the reason being much of the vocal work was not recorded nor given a final form. A major example of this is \\"Do You Like Worms?\\". The lyrics on the 2004 version are vintage 1966 lines Van Dyke wrote but were not recorded.  Another major example is the key track, \\"Surf's Up\\", was not even given a final edit or even recorded all the way. \\"Surf's Up\\" was assembled from the pieces available. They have the piano demo and also the first half of the track. The second half, which the archivists think was recorded but are uncertain on that point, has gone missing in the intervening forty four years since it was supposedly recorded.  \\"Surf's Up\\" 2011 is not what \\"Surf's Up \\" 1967 would have been simply because Wilson would have recorded the last half and would not have to piecemeal the track from various versions simply because that's all he could do.   And really, that's the heart of the problem with the original 1960s sessions for SMiLE. Whereas Tolkien worked on his book for most of his life, Wilson only did primary work on SMiLE for a little under a year. Tolkien worked on THE SILMARILLION for almost all of his adult life. However, the medium of writing is kinder than the medium of music. If Tolkien went back to a 1930s text and worked on it in the 1960s, then probably no one would be any the wiser because the medium is so drastically different. That is another key difference between Tolkien and Wilson.   However, if The Beach Boys of today added vocals to truly finish the album, loads of fans would scream (and rightfully so) foul, because there would be such a disconnect from The Beach Boys' vocal capabilities of 2011 compared to 1966-1967. The purists were put off when Mick Jagger put on additional vocals to EXILE ON MAINSTREET outtakes in 2010 and Bruce Springsteen did some overdubbing for the release of his album THE PROMISE, comprise of material recorded during DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN (they weren't really outtakes, they were just material recorded in congruence with that masterpiece of an album). Also, Brian's the only one left of the three Wilson brothers. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died in 1998.  So what is the solution to this conundrum? Why, to start fresh, record all the material anew, bring Van Dyke to complete the lyrical work, and actually finish the album. And that is what Brian Wilson has done . . . all the way back in 2004.  I know there has been been debate that Darian Sahanaja, a leader of Wilson's backing band the Wondermints,, and Domenic Priore, author of LOOK, LISTEN, VIBRATE, SMILE and Smile: The Story of Brian Wilson's Lost Masterpiece were influences on that project, especially in the tracking sequence. Regardless of there is any validity to these concerns, the fact is Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks returned to SMiLE in 2003 and finished it, presenting it as a complete and coherent work.   And what is the main problem with the 2004 SMiLE? The fact that it is not the vintage tapes and those are not 1960s Beach Boys vocals. When Wilson released the 2004 SMiLE, a lot of fans were happy but a large faction wanted The Beach Boys' stunning vocals and harmonies, which, as wonderful as The Wondermints are, they are simply no Beach Boys, and 2004 Brian Wilson cannot compare to 1967 Brian Wilson.  Even though Wilson was able to complete the album 37 years later, the completed version of 2004 is not what everyone wanted. But if you want to know the final form of SMiLE, and how it should stand as a completed, work, the 2004 SMiLE is the logical conclusion to this famous album's story.   Listening to The Beach Boys' version of SMiLE, as opposed to the 2004 SMiLE, is like sifting through an incomplete manuscript with various lacunas and missing pages when the finished draft is sitting right next to it. The 2004 album is filled with vocals and overall the work sounds finished. What were once instrumentals (Holiday, Look) now have lyrics. There is cohesion and the logical flow. There simply is not the same narrative sweep to the 1967 SMiLE as there is to the 2004 SMiLE, and that's because the lyrics were either not written or not recorded.  The 2011 SMiLE sounds exactly like what it is - incomplete, but still wonderful. And also, what the 2004 finished version demonstrated (and the 2011 Sessions explicitly proved) is Wilson was not that far away from completing his work back in 1967, at least musically. Wilson simply reworked the material already in existence, and added the missing vocals and lyrics. Although there are new lyrics in the 2004 version, there is no new music that was not already recorded in 1966-1967.  Another piece of evidence that demonstrates the 2004 version is the definitive and finished form is the 2011 version follows the 2004 tracklisting exactly, with one minor exception (placing the linking track \\"I'm In Great Shape\\" to earlier in the album, which sequeways quite nicely into \\"Barnyard\\" and sonicallysounds like a match.  So even though we now have an official version of SMiLE from the original tapes, SMiLE still remains an elusive, tantalizing \\"What could have been\\" scenario that will can never be fully answered. At least, not by the 1966-67 tapes anyway, or even the 2004 version. Though the 2004 album does present the work as finished, we can never know what would have happened had Wilson finished the project in 1967, nor what a finished 1967 album would have even been or sounded like, as so much of the vocal work was left incomplete and then the months of tape editing required to finish the project never happened. And it's quite possible the track listing would have been completely different. There were plans [there was talk] about having talking tracks in between the songs (like \\"Brian Fell into a Piano\\" and the Vegetables comedy bit). We'll never know how a 1967 SMiLE would have completed with SGT. PEPPER or if The Beach Boys' late 1960s career would have differed had SMiLE been critically acclaimed and praised. Most likely it would have been like PET SOUNDS and not sold that well.  I am glad though Wilson did live to complete his version in 2004, and he oversaw the production and release of the 2011 Sessions box. That gives both versions of the album an authority the project would never have had if Wilson died before the material was released, like Tolkien. Had he died we could have had any number of different competing versions, just like Jimi Hendrix's numerous posthumous albums all attempting to approximate what his fourth LP would have been (though reasonable FIRST RAYS OF THE NEW RISING SUN, despite the terrible cover, may very well be a reasonable approximation, despite the presence of the 1968 outtake \\"My Friend\\" which most likely would NOT have been on a fourth LP by Hendrix). And though we'll never know what a 1967 SMiLE would have been, we can be quite thankful Wilson finished the work in 2004 and (finally!) [even] officially released The BeachBoy's Frankenstein version in 2011!   Ultimately, SMiLE has come to symbolize the unrealized utopian ideals and what if possibilities of the 1960s counter culture. That was not Wilson's intent when recording, but that is the role the album plays in our culture's history. The album has always been perfect because it was always on the cusp of becoming, but did not fully arrive. That is why SMiLE has been such a highly personal record for so many people - it was never clearly defined what SMiLE actually WAS, so you could make and sequence to your hearts content, and that be just as valid as someone else's attempt to make SMiLE. I'm just glad Wilson's reconstruction has finally been authorized, and we get a glimpse of what could have been, though not, perhaps, for the last time. I believe the release of the Sessions has just expanded the mythos behind the album, not settled it. I feel SMiLE will live far beyond our time, simply because of the great narrative feel of the story and the amazing finish the project got. It only took us forty four years and a solo version to get there.  There are happy endings (and new beginnings) in this world after all. Bravo Brian!
B000002LRX|5.0|You know the story.  Influentinal underground pre-alternative group Faith No More part ways with eccentric vocalist Chuck Mosley and mostly borrow Mike Patton from Bay area disaster rock group Mr. Bungle.  Patton is tasked with writing lyrics for his new band's third record in a matter of weeks.  1989's The Real Thing would prove to be a harbinger of the impending tsunami of Alternative music that would take over MTV and FM radio in a little over 2 years. Through the lens of history one can see that the record outshone its immitators (and outright thieves) in every imaginable way.  Part metal, part prophecy, TRT is the 6000 horsepower diesel engine that pushed pop to the precipice that Kurt Cobain had only to tap over the edge with a 7 second rif.  Now with a grammy nomination in their back pocket, some well deserved respect from their peers and with the death toll standing at one goldfish, Faith No More began work on their next record.  Of course they didn't deliver just a record.<br /><br />Growing up a Beatles devotee, the concept of an album that was greater than the sum of its parts was not foreign to me.  The problem is that my generation had so few albums that we could hold up as equals to our parent's stellar vinyl collection.  Yes, The Cure did give us Disintegration. However, just like The Real Thing, all of those songs are clearly cut from the same cloth.  Our generation needed an album as ecletically brilliant and sonically dynamic as Sgt. Pepper's.  An album so stylistically at odds with the rest of the band's catalog that it ran the risk of alientaing their new following.  An album that, 20 years later, I could mention in the same sentence as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and still sleep well at night.  Angel Dust is that album.<br /><br />Much the way each Beatle has their showcase moment on Sgt. Peppers, Mike, Billy, Roddy, Jim & Puffy's individual fingerprints are all over this record.  Patton supplied lyrics culled from fortune cookies (Land of Sunshine) and what we'll call vocal schizophrenia.  Roddy offered his ode to a special kind of affection (Be Aggressive) and more keyboards and samples than on all other FNM releases combined.  Billy wrote the best song of his career (Caffeine) and his bass work is simply inspired on both Kindergarten and Crack Hitler. Jim gave us the metal monster Jizzlobber and a criminally under-appreciated guitar tone. And through it all Bordin supplied Swiss watch precision drumming.  Turns out that being good does get you stuff.<br /><br />One could argue that Angel Dust was the natural progression of Faith No More's sound.  If The Real Thing was darker in nature than Introduce Yourself, Angel Dust is a funeral march.  At best, this record is punctuated by moments of levity (RV, Be Aggressive) but the album has an oppressive quality to it, something ordinarily reserved for the industrial and death metal scene.  Moreover, the darkness and sense of desolation only increase as you progress your way through the record.  The doom builds to a crescendo in Crack Hitler only to reach its climax in Jizzlober.  Martin's punishing guitar creates a wall of sound that is eventually over-run by a gothic pipe organ and choir that sound like the end of all things.  Every bit as powerful as the hammer of God piano strike that concludes &#34;Day In The Life,&#34; had the record ended here no one would have complained.  But like an epic movie there must be music for the closing credits.  Midnight Cowboy was an understated stroke of genius.  It properly cleanses the pallet and allows you the few necessary moments to reflect on what you've heard, gather your thoughts, and then re-enter the real world.  What a long, strange trip it was.<br /><br />Whereas The Beatles needed to assume alter-egos (and do a LOT of drugs) to write Sgt Pepper's, Angel Dust can be seen as the ultimate expression of who these men are as musicians.  The kicker is that the band knew it.  They snubbed the media (especially the dolts MTV sent out), harassed and humiliated one another on stage and played like they were the most important band in the world.  The truth is that for a very brief time, and for a very grateful and loyal fanbase, that's exactly what they were.<br /><br />Am I reaching here?  Can this record and this band stand shoulder to shoulder with rock's greatest creation?  Without a doubt.  While the critics were busy fawning over Thom Yorke, begging U2 to release The Joshua Tree part 2 (which they should have) and telling you Kula Shaker was the next Oasis, Faith No Nore were busy eviscerating their career and, in so doing, delivering their masterpiece.  So few bands accomplish this.  There are any number of great records from the 90's; but Angel Dust wasn't great, it created a genre.  Just like our parents needed Sgt Pepper's to stand alone at the top of rock's greatest records list, our generation needed Angel Dust; an album that, regardless of record sales or what critics had to say, would stand the test of time as an uncorrupted work of art.  20 years later this album is not meerly going strong, it is a beacon.  Angel Dust is unequivocally the greatest realized vision and collective musical achievement of the Alternative movement.<br /><br />Take that Ok Computerd humiliated one another on stage and played like they were the most important band in the world.

B004EPYZV2|5.0|The first and third Mission Impossible films are pretty enjoyable (not a fan of the 2nd), but nothing compares to the action and stunt scenes pulled off here. The plot is not mind blowing, though it's engaging, and people survive enough near death close calls to make James Bond blush, but the cast, gadgets and fight scenes make up for everything. I hate to admit it but Tom Cruise is really good here. He is believable and even did all of his own stunts. Believe me, after seeing this film that is quite a feat. Simon Pegg provides his usual humorous moments, Jeremy Renner is a welcome addition to the team and Paula Patton holds her own, as well as, filling out a tight green dress nicely.<br /><br />IMAX is the way to go. The world's tallest building scene alone makes you feel like you're right with Tom Cruise as he hangs 1,300 feet above the ground. Our IMAX theater didn't get the first 6 minutes of The Dark Knight Rises (I almost cried), but at least I saw the new trailer. I had already seen TDKR prologue online anyway, but it was low quality and a far cry from experiencing it on IMAX.<br /><br />Even if you are not a fan or have never seen a Mission Impossible movie, you can jump right in with this 4th installment and still have a blast.

B004LROUNG|4.0|This is an entertaining read that is paced to keep you turning the pages. As the book opens, David Zinc -a Harvard educated lawyer working for a major Chicago law firm decides he has had enough of the sweatshop mentality and quits. He ends up working for a small \\"boutique\\" law firm that chases ambulances rather than advertise for new business. As usual, Grisham laces this story with humor and colorful characters. I loved reading about lawyers from the other side of the track; what they lacked in depth they made up for in personality. In short Grisham uses a slightly different approach in this novel, but it works. Recommend for his fans and anyone who enjoys this genre of book
B000NU2CY4|4.0|Having had this film on standard dvd it was worth the upgrade to blu-ray to get both the Thearetical and Extended releases and the special feature documentaries.  I didn't get the \\"remastered\\" version and being based in Singapore it means it's difficult to get a replacement but truth be told, I didn't even notice the \\"imperfections\\" until I was told about them and until then I was quite happy with the overall much improved picture and sound quality over the standard dvd that I originally had.  The opening war scene sounded excellent in the DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround mode for example and the 1080p definition made the picture quality the best I had ever seen it.  Ridley Scott in the introduction to the extended version makes it clear that it is not the Director's cut which he says is still the thearetical version however my personal preference is for the extended version which I feel does make the film a little better and the actions of the cast a little more understandable.  The greatness of this film comes from an excellent script coupled with excellent performances from a great cast and other than the principal actors special mention should be made for Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi's roles as well; old-timers who can still effortlessly steal the show.<br /><br />Do contact customer service first if you want to get the remastered version which is something I would have done had I known about the issue in advance but as far as this still being a great movie that looks and sounds even better in 1080p and DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround with two versions of the film there is no doubt.<br /><br />Still recommended!
0307593312|4.0|I loved this novel. I loved it not because it leads to some grand truth, but because it consists of puzzles among puzzles. We have moments in our lives which in retrospect sent us in a specific direction (1q84) or not; we have people we remember and on wonder about from our past. Hell I think we are all stuck in a post 9-11 1q84. Each chapter is beautiful and puzzling, leaving us with things to chew on long after the book. What more to ask?

B004J4WKTW|4.0|Shrouded in mystery and laced with magic, this is a book that makes the imagination come alive. It's about a very special, very sophisticated circus that suddenly appears in town and creates the ambience of New Years Eve just as the clock strikes twelve. Aside from the magnificent descriptions and creative circus acts, there is also a dark side to the story; a battle between two illusionists bound to each other in an intriguing life altering game. Although these and other characters pale in comparison to the setting, they are solidly drawn, likeable and easy to identify with. For me however, the beautiful imagery and original content is what makes this book stand out from the crowd, it's an amazing read. I recommend this for those that like fantasy stories or can suspend belief long enough to go with the flow of this beautifully written, captivating debut. Summit Entertainment has purchased the movie rights to this book.
B000024HHH|5.0|Jazz fusion isn't always the easiest genre of music to appreciate if you are not a die hard afficienado but there are exceptions and some of these albums prove to be extremely rewarding for an even wider audience as well.  \\"Inner Mounting Flame\\" is a very good example of what if you absolutely have to put a label to it belongs in the jazz fusion genre but it really trancends rigid categorising and so makes it extremely accessible to fans of rock, modern jazz, aspiring drummers, jazz violinists, bassists, pianists and especially guitarists.<br /><br />Those guitarists looking to be more complete musicians cannot afford to not be inspired and to learn from this great John McLaughlin masterpiece.  He shows his greatness here not only as a good composer and arranger of complex musical structures but also in his tastefulness and in his willingness like a truly great jazz musician to let his bandmates express themselves as well and in addition to his mastery of several playing styles from the very fast and hard like on \\"The Noonward Race\\" and \\"Vital Transformation\\" to the gentle and mellow like on \\"A Lotus On Irish Streams\\".  Every track is a gem and like a true classic the album sounds great from start to finish and each track seems destined to be where they are in the track order and just wouldn't sound as good otherwise.  Imagine trying to change the track order of say \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" for example and you know what I mean.<br /><br />Although John is the main and featured soloist here the rest of the band is also great with some inspired jazz drumming from Billy Cobham as well as jazz violin from Jerry Goodman reminiscent of Stephane Grappelli's work with the greatest guitarist who ever lived, Django Reinhardt, not to mention Rick Laird's pounding bass and Jan Hammer's great touch on the piano.  The very tight rhythm section is what allows John to take off on his fantastic flights of incredibly fast and yet tasteful solos.  This is a remarkable debut album for any band and certainly ranks among the best ever debuts in any genre and fans of mini-lp replica sleeves (mlps) are in for a real treat here.  The mlps has been designed and assembled very well making this among the best mlps releases that I've ever seen which should satisfy the collectors.  The sound quality is also good having been well remastered although the bass parts in a couple of tracks are so heavy that they sound like they will almost get muddy but overall the sound quality is still very good.<br /><br />Essential listening especially for those aspiring to be complete guitarists with excellent and accessible fusion content, good sound quality and a quality mlps release makes this very highly recommended!ainly ranks among the best ever debuts in any genre and fans of mini-lp replica sleeves (mlps) are in for a real treat here.

B0002U0UKS|5.0|[This review written by this user's son, the music lunatic of the family.]<br /><br />If you enjoy any Hisaishi at all, this is a very safe buy. Everyone else has already hit on the points - a beautiful orchestral score, a repeating theme that gives you chills (\\"The Merry-go-round of Life\\"), and overall a beautiful work of art. I'm easily entertained, but I'm not the only one who doesn't tire of that same \\"Merry-go-round of Life\\" theme even after listening to it a thousand times. It's that beautiful.<br /><br />This score came off very nicely, in my mind; though I loved \\"Spirited Away,\\" I found it a bit skimpy in terms of thematic material - leaning towards minimalism, if you know what I mean. It evoked raw emotions, but it wasn't overflowing with musical merit in some pieces. This CD, compared to \\"Spirited Away,\\" is probably easier on most casual listeners, in my opinion (though not to badmouth \\"Spirited Away,\\" though, which is amazing in its own right) because it's simply easier to keep up with, music-wise. Listener be warned, though - some tracks are very short - like a minute or less in length. That means you will have some breaks more often than usual, but it doesn't detract from the CD by much, if at all. Beautiful music, through and through, which gives it a rating of five stars.<br /><br />[Formal review ends here - in short, I endorse this CD wholeheartedly. You won't regret buying it. What follows is a fanboy rant for the fanatics like me.]<br /><br />And yes, the way Hisaishi incorporates that same theme over and over and over again is simply mind-blowing - it pops up in \\"The Promise of the World\\" (before the actually \\"The Merry-go-round of Life\\" part of the track) in a brief piano interlude that makes you stop and think for a second - is it the theme or is it not? Similarly, the ghost of the theme can be heard in \\"The Boy Who Drank Stars\\" (or \\"Cave of Mind\\" or whatever it's called, that penultimate track) in a BEAUTIFUL variation wherein the trumpet settles for playing counterpoint - it's a stroke of musical genius that still has me raving, even now.<br /><br />For those who are curious, the theme \\"The Merry-go-round of Life\\" goes something like:<br /><br />[ascending]D - G - Bb - D, C - Bb - A - Bb, G - Bb - D - G, G - F - Eb - F, blah blah blah. You'll know it when you hear maybe twice. It appears in most of the tracks; it's almost a scavenger hunt when you listen through, looking for it. I can't talk enough about this.<br /><br />Suffice to say, this CD is so very buy-worthy, in case you missed my \\"in short\\" statement up there in brackets.stroke of musical genius that still has me raving, even now.

B004GUSG4M|5.0|This is an amazing book from cover to cover. It captivates right from the start and is a fascinating read based on a very clever premise. As a result of an accident, the protagonist Christine has a rare but very real brain injury; she can only remember new information while she's awake. As soon as she sleeps, her brain erases everything, so each morning she wakes up lost and confused and wondering how she got to be middle aged. The story makes you realize that memory and trust are closely tied together. S.J. Watson creates a lot of suspense by building on this concept and keeps you guessing by slowly revealing the intentions and character of Christine's husband Ben, her doctor Edmund Nash and the circumstances of her accident. The pacing is intense so beware, once started this book is hard to put down. In short, an excellent psychological thriller for those who enjoy puzzling out a good mystery. Well done debut! Highly recommend. Ridley Scott has already scoffed up the film rights for this book.

But you have to watch it.

Max is now involved in a cult-like church and ends up suing Zoe for the rights to the embroyes.  This results in an intense court case.<br /><br />As usual, Picoult picks an edgy topic and shows multiple sides to it.  Her book is told in chapters alternating between various characters.  This develops the characters and gives readers a strong insight into how the hot topic is affecting them.  Picoult is masterful at this technique.  She also does a great job researching the legality of the issue at the heart of her books, and Sing You Home is no exception.<br /><br />Even the secondary characters in this book are fully developed and interesting in their own right.  Readers will feel for Liddy, want to help Lucy and despise Wade.  Picoult's books are always good ones to discuss and  this book will stay true to that pattern.  I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it.<br /><br />[...]
B004P8JPS6|4.0|There's plenty of action in this latest installment of the Jack Reacher series. This one is actually a prequel to the others and shows how it all started; why Reacher left the army, how he acquired his tough guy persona and why he became a no roots kind of guy. The story takes place in a small Mississippi town in 1997. Jack is working undercover doing damage control for a sticky military situation. His mission is challenging on many levels as his tries to put the pieces together and keep out of harms way. There's also a stronger than usual romance thread woven into this story when Jack meets a female version of himself. The story is great from start to finish. It's gritty , intriguing and shows Jack in great form. In short, Reacher fans will love this one but it's also a great beginning for those new to the series

I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of reading this novel and was unable to put it down until I was done.  Then I needed to ponder the story for a day before I could begin to contemplate choosing another book to read (although I have at least 10 to read on my Kindle).  I fully understand why he needed to wait to write this novel.  I lived through the time period as well and still find it traumatic.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I especially love it when a debut novel charms me into skipping a meal or two and this book did just that. Front and center and totally able to carry this character driven novel is Victoria, a product of the foster care system. The story is told from her viewpoint and realistically reflects how emotional and physical abuse damages the psyche and hinders a person's ability to form normal relationships. Victoria's journey is filled with beauty and anguish. As she struggles to find herself as an adult recently released from the foster care system, she discovers her passion for flowers and their meaning. This is an enchanting thread steeped in knowledge gleaned from the Victorian Age, which the author uses to bond the characters together. In summary a great book for those who like character-driven novels with strong emotional pull. Excellent book club choice.
B00005JK8K|3.0|This movie has a lot of good battle scenes that are good, but nothing compared to saving private ryan. There are scenes that are so unbelievable it is hard not to bust out laughing. Cage pretends to be a prisoner and walks over to the Japanese during a battle and stops 100 soldiers, it is a lot like Hogans Heros from TV. The code talkers are giving locations to be bombed using \\"code\\"...why!!?? Someone at the top(writer, director, producer??) knows nothing about war and did not hire the people who could tell them how ridiculous many of the scenes were. On and on it goes. One scene where 50 Japs overrun a group of 10 American soldiers yet somehow Cage walks away from this ambush and the Japs have all gone (pointless) and one more...the code talker is beaten during a battle by the japs...why?? In WWII he would have been captured and brought to interrogators and made to talk, not beaten by a group of jap soldiers during a battle, it made zero sense. They needed info (intel) from the Indian, beating him was a joke.

B005J7K964|5.0|I have been obsessed with this film, and this version of the film, since I first saw it in a little art house theater in Norfolk, VA waaaay back in 1985.  I paid $100 to special order it when it was released on VHS, and that has been the only way I'd been able to see it since then.  Then the 2008 and 2010 restorations came out and I was blown away by how different the complete film is from Moroder's version.  But my heart belongs to this version.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|The main character of this book is a man you want to get to know and spend some time with. He's shrewd and savvy with a checkered past and a strong inner voice compelling him to do what's right. His name is Harry, he's a detective in Oslo Norway and his compelling personality adds a lot of entertainment to this book. The plot is also packed with suspense and true to its genre- there are twists, turns, false leads, crime scenes, layers of mystery and action. The basic premises of this book revolves around Harry and his partner Katrine tracking down a demented serial killer. Once the characters are in place, the book takes off. In fact the second half of the book is non stop at times. In short, this is an excellent book for those who enjoy fast paced mystery/thrillers. It predictable but a completely satisfying read and certainly adds to the reason for the growing popularity of Scandinavian crime literature .

0060873086|4.0|UBER story teller, Michael Crichton, died in late 2008 with an unfinished work in progress. His publisher, Harper Collins, searched for someone to complete his work and chose Richard Preston. The \\"result\\" is the science thriller MICRO.<br /><br />The story moves from labs of Harvard to Honoluly quickly, and in typical Crichton fashion, science takes over.<br /><br />I won't spoil this story for those who love Crichton's works; however, having read many of his books, Preston was a masterful choice for completion of this work.<br /><br />Unlike Jeffrey Deaver taking over the Ian Fleming franchise for James Bond, this book is REALLY Crichton's work and I do hope they make it into a movie like Jurassic Park. It should be done with \\"little\\" trouble.<br /><br />Crichton lovers should keep an eye out for the Science Channel work \\" The World of Michael Crichton\\" to air early in 2012.<br /><br />NOTE * I listened to this book on CDs.

It begins with a history of money that, while interesting in itself, is more important in showing how economists have been wrong about the most basic issues they study starting with the idea of exchange through barter. He unpacks the received notions of Adam Smith and other classical thinkers to show that the profession has founding myths that serve the function of valorizing current practices. Essentially they don't function much differently than creation stories of religion--Genesis (1-3), Lord Brahma the Creator, the Great Serpent and all that--not subject to scientific inquiry but the basis for rules and standards that govern the faithful. (The last sentence is my reading of the Graeber).<br /><br />One by one the assumptions that guide economists are questioned and found wanting. Barter, for example, was the way that people exchanged goods before the invention of money, mentioned above, according to most economic texts--but try to find examples of it in the literature. You won't. Another shibboleth of long standing is that human interactions are forms of exchange. This works if one ignores everything moral, philosophical or artistic that defines us as human, in other words disregards anything that undermines initial suppositions and prejudices. This is, of course, exactly the method that economists use when creating the studies that reinforce their beliefs/outlook.<br /><br />An old joke is a good example of this. A physicist, an engineer, and an economist are stranded on a desert island with lots of canned food but no can opener. The physicist tries to open a can by heating it but it explodes; the engineer climbs a tree and drops a rock on a can but it ruptures and splatters the contents into the dirt. The economist says, \\"Assume a can opener...\\"<br /><br />If you make the right assumptions then anything is possible.<br /><br />Graeber is great on the debt part of his inquiry, asking how a commercial transaction with a certain degree of risk that results in a debt has been elevated to a basic, immutable moral law. Much of the answer lies not in the ethics of the situation but in the ability of one party to enforce the contract even to the great detriment of the other party--or, more likely, its successors. The grinding down of highly indebted poor countries by the IMF in order to repay loans that were simply stolen by unelected leaders, many of whom were voted out of office or, more likely, overthrown in rebellions, by the same people who are being told they are now responsible for the indebtedness is an example of this. If a brutal dictator ruled a tropical hellhole for decades and is finally defeated by rebellious citizens the new government is expected to honor every penny, franc and farthing the dictator managed to cadge from banks in the advanced sector--including the tens of millions of dollars the former ruler borrowed in loans subsidized by France, England or the United States so that his military could buy helicopter gunships from manufacturers in the country that loaned him the money. That half the proceeds of the loans were rerouted to banks in the Cayman Islands by the former ruler and the other half was used to buy helicopters used to slaughter insurgents makes no difference--in the twisted morality of the realm of debt it is all the same and must be repaid.<br /><br />Graeber is less convincing in his survey of the history of debt across centuries and continents--while he has a lot of data on China, India, Europe and North America going back millennia it is a lot to synthesize and present, particularly for someone who is not a historian. However he does such a wonderful job with the dismantling and reconstruction of our notions of debt and justice that we tend to forgive any lacunae that might occur in the very broad sketch of the 5,000 years he covers.very broad sketch of the 5,000 years he covers.
B0015ABRE2|1.0|It's really weird to see so many good reviews, considering it's such a disappointment. The first two seasons were the best thing TV has ever seen, but this third season, if it had been the first, would not have even been renewed. People seem to highly  rate it based on the other seasons. This season is completely predictable throughout, the mood is never quite set correctly, and their attention to detail has severely diminished. If you don't believe me, watch what happens in the first episode of season four when they undo everything they tried to do this season. For instance, they created a nonsense love storyline with Batista to entice women viewers, but did so very poorly. The fist episode from season four starts with a no-name cop you've never seen before awkwardly making smalltalk with him eventually leading to \\"What ever happened to you and forgettable-actress?\\" in which he replies \\"We broke up,\\" followed by no subsequent talk, as the no-name cop backs away, never to ever be seen on the show ever again. I recommend skipping to season four, because nothing of any real consequence happens in season three, and it was terrible to boot. It might deserve two stars, but such a precipitous drop from the first two seasons cemented a one star from me.

0307720748|3.0|I realized that SIR Richard Branson had more depth than his stunts, baloon rides and self-promotion when I read about his expectation of space travel.....so I got his UPdated version of his book * Losing My Verginity * How I Survived, Had Fun, and Made a Fortune Doing Business May Way.<br /><br />First - he acknowledges * early and often * his parents for their suport and for instilling his NEVER GIVE UP attitude.  His aunt actually mortgaged her home to provide him seed funds for one of his early businesses.<br /><br />As a real estate professional, I L'VE how he started locating his VIRGIN music stores in heavy foot traffic areas of large cities in the UK.  Most of those buildings in the 70s and 80s were owned by the ground floor shop keepers and the second floor space was vacant.  He and his team, asked to occupy the second floor FREE until the shopkeeper/building owner could locate another PAYING tenant.  The additional business brought in by the music stores to the ground floor shops allowed his stores to remain with NO rent for several years.<br /><br />He started his first business * a newspaper for students called STUDENT * when he was 16 and has never looked back....and then he started his VIRGIN enterprises that now number over 400 and BRANDED the \\"brand\\" so well, so that when the much LARGER Thorn EMI * think Beatles * bought it  for $1B in the early 80s, Branson signed a 5 year non-compete agreement AND EMI got to use the VIRGIN name which was calculated in the purchase price.<br /><br />I wish I had been able to listen to the book on CDs spoken by Branson.  Unfortunately, the book is not offered in this format so I elected the larger, soft cover edition with the 2 additional chapters for his current exploits.<br /><br />YES!  There are SEX, small LIES and MANY photos v video tapes....the photo of his arrival at his wedding to his wife, Joan, on his Necker Island, hanging from a helicopter with a box of chocolates in his mouth is sweet.<br /><br />While looking for photos of this event, the hundreds of him almost ALWAYS show him smiling and HAVING FUN.<br /><br />If you know someone who suffers from Dyslexia * tell them about Richard Branson * who overcame the syndrome and has flourished and effected and changed the lives of many around the world....and had FUN!<br /><br />Richard has a blog on the VIRGIN website....[...]most ALWAYS show him smiling and HAVING FUN.

He loves building it and seeing all the detail inside. I dont know if the typical 9 year old could do this one as it is mainly for 16 and older, but my kiddo has aspergers so he is smarter than he average kid. Highly recommend!

1400067936|5.0|\\"This book is about luck--or, more precisely, about how we perceive and deal with luck in life and business.  Set against the backdrop of the most conspicuous form in which luck is mistaken for skill--the world of [financial] trading.\\"<br /><br />Nassim Nicholas Taleb is extremely smart, extremely well-read, and has studied deeply and broadly how we humans fool ourselves into believing that being in the right place at the right time is, in fact, proof that we, or others, possess above-average knowledge and skill.  He has been described as an \\"erudite raconteur,\\" and this characteristic serves him well in his writing, where he interweaves interesting, entertaining stories of how people fool themselves (or are fooled by others) with rigorous explanations of why this occurs--over and over again.<br /><br />A primary reason activities and events that involve human behavior cannot be modeled on physical science is that we humans have a built-in bias to attribute our successes to skill, and our failures to bad luck.  Paul E. Meehl demonstrated the \\"attribution bias\\" in his 1954 study of experts comparing their perceived abilities to their statistical ones.  \\"It shows a substantial discrepancy between the objective record of people's success in prediction tasks and the sincere beliefs of these people about the quality of their performance.\\"<br /><br />Attribution bias is not limited to individuals, but extends to large institutions and organizations.  Anyone who has read a mutual fund prospectus is likely familiar with the phrase, \\"Past performance is no guarantee of future performance.\\"  However, financial trading institutions routinely make decisions on the basis of past performance.  One routinely used risk management tool is value at risk (VaR), defined as, \\"a technique used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical price trends and volatilities.\\"<br /><br />Taleb is adamant in his opposition to the use of VaR for managing risk.  \\"An interesting problem is the `value at risk' issue where people imagine that they have a way to understand the risk using `complicated mathematics' and running predictions on rare events--thinking that they were able from past data to observe the probability distributions.  The most interesting behavioral aspect is that those who advocate it do not seem to have tested their past predicting record, another Meehl type of problem.\\"<br /><br />While I was led to this book from another on financial risk management, I found the book to be much more expansive in its scope.  The combination of great story telling, science, mathematics, philosophy, and social sciences makes this a very interesting, entertaining, and informative read for anyone who wants to know why we humans so often confuse luck for skill, often with disastrous results, in everyday life as well as business and finance.s the `value at risk' issue where people imagine that they have a way to understand the risk using `complicated mathematics' and running predictions on rare events--thinking that they were able from past data to observe the probability distributions.

B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|I loved this album when it first came out in 1983, have listened to it for nearly thirty years, and still love it!  Black Sabbath is my favorite band of all time.  I have stood by them through so many different incantations.  I remember how happy I was upon hearing Dio had joined after Ozzy's split.  His early works with Sabbath, rejoining for \\"Dehumanizer,\\" and then again rejoining for the Heaven and Hell recordings and gigs are also great.  I was lucky enough to see what I think was Heaven and Hell's last appearance.  It was in Atlantic City.  What a joy it was to hear just a sampling of \\"Country Girl!\\"  I'd never heard them do that.  Anyway, I was devastated when Dio left the band after only two studio albums and a live one.  I was like, who's next?  I was overjoyed to find Ian Gillan had come aboard.  A classic and influential singer!  What would the album sound like?  Well, this album is heavy, heavy, heavy!  Great singing by Ian, great guitar by Tony and Geezer, and most of all, great drumming by Bill Ward!  Ward drums his ass off on this album!  Every single song on \\"Born Again\\" is great.  AGAIN, I was sad when Ian left after only one album, but the rebirth of Deep Purple was worth it.  I was lucky enough to see Ray Gillen live during the \\"Seventh Star\\" tour in northern NJ.  By the way, it was the only time I saw longtime underated and neglected keyboardist, Geoff Nichols on stage, and playing where fans could see him.  A wonderful night of music!  My love for Black Sabbath doesn't stop there.  I relish Tony Martin's work with the band!  All of those albums are really good, the standout being \\"Headless Cross.\\"  A great work, every song is wonderful.  You see, that's how I judge a Sabbath album:  Is EVERY song good?  OK to all of you young Sabbath fans who think Ozzy is the only Sabbath:  Thanks for listening, but you have to listen to it ALL.  Black Sabbath is much more than \\"Paranoid,\\" I assure you.  Listen to \\"Psychophobia,\\" from \\"Cross Purposes!\\"  Boy, does it kick butt.  And Tony Martin is singing, not Ozzy.  OK.  This lesson from a 54 year old Sabbath fan is that ALL of the singers are good.  A reunion tour with Ian Gillan or Tony Martin would be dynamite.  Thanks Black Sabbath, for giving us years of wonderful music, despite who stood in front of the microphone.  ALL the singers have been wonderful.

Ozzy does not hold back in this book and it is rated R and not for children , unless you want them to learn from his lessons. language is straight and to the point like you were talking to him and he was telling you his story, cuss words and all..lol I loved it glad to have read it wish there was another volume.

The fact that I already own the game and have no problem buying it again for my Fire (though the cost is much lower than it was for the Nintendo) attests to how good a puzzle game it is.

I used to think that after King became a successful writer, he wouldn't allow anyone to edit his books anymore and that they were too long.  But I recently read the unedited version of \\"The Stand\\" - well over 1000 pages long, and there was nothing there that I would remove.  This one is over 850 pages of great writing. It contains time warps, history, a love story, suspense, heartache, and a lot of Texas and Maine.  It would make a great movie.

B005WTR4ZI|5.0|The book is a quick and engaging read.  I especially like the chessboard analogy describing the rate of increase in technological knowledge.  If your position in society is based on old technology and you are not inclined to learn new things to be able to perform a new job, then be afraid, be very afraid.  This book describes a great restructuring that is going on and will continue.  There will be pain, and blood!.  In fact, I don't think the book goes far enough to describe the disruptions that we may see.  The self-driving Google vehicle is bound to lower long-haul freight costs by replacing truck drivers on long hauls- something that the current technology can handle easily.  This will help manufacturing and distribution by lowering costs. But what about all those truck drivers?<br /><br />The book overlooks the profound changes that are going on right now with paperless technologies.  I bought the Kindle edition of this book.  That's great for me (and Amazon.com) but not so great for lumberjacks, truck drivers and paper mill workers.<br /><br />If you're the kind of person who embraces new ideas and has a passion to learn, you will be encouraged by this book.  You have lots to look forward to. You will be able to take advantage of the revolution in online education to get the skills you need to prosper.<br /><br />The authors do a good job of proposing specific solutions.  They don't just say \\"improve education\\" (duh!) but they say increase teacher compensation, increase classroom time and get rid of tenure. They also recommend removing the tax-favored treatment of mortgage interest and employer insurance benefits.

B001UV4XIS|4.0|Over all The DVD was pretty good, but the sound went up an down sometimes. so I had to manually use sound control. I dont have a Blue Ray player so that might be reason.
0312323867|5.0|I like everyone else who has read \\"Something Borrowed\\" was hesitant about reading this book since it is from Darcys point of view. But I am SO glad I did. It helps you understand her side of everything that had happened between her and Dex and Rachel. In the beginning she made huge mistakes and was just a terrible person but after she moves to London, she changes for the better in so many ways! There are quite a few surprises in this book and the last few chapters I needed a tissue next to me because I couldn't stop crying. Be prepared for a whole new Darcy halfway through the book, your opinion of her will change drastically and you will find yourself rooting for her!  If you have read \\"Something Borrowed\\" I HIGHLY recommend reading this follow up book! I couldn't put it down!
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather for Aneroid is great!  It provides accurate forecasts in an easy to understand format.  It offers everything you could want, including radar and long range forecasts.  Everything is top notch!!!
0811879542|5.0|This has become the new household favorite, passing Llama Llama Red Pajama.  This book is an innovative and creative way to keep young children engaged in reading.  I will say, as a warning to other parents, that my two year old son loves this book so much that for the past few weeks I have been required to read it multiple times a day...
B004EPZ084|4.0|Good movie for adults if you love to laugh.  You've never seen Collin Ferrell like this before; you'll love to hate him.  Jennifer Aniston makes a great perverted b-word ;)  Twists throughout, enjoy..
1400069181|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book but, by the end of it, I realized the title summed it up pretty well. It's all about starting something that matters through entrepreneurship in the way that Blake Mycoskie has managed through his shoe company, TOMS. Mycoskie postulates that charity and giving have their place even in a for-profit venture. Businesses, companies, and regular people should treat giving as integral in their lives and not just an afterthought.  Mycoskie has the proof in the pudding. Through the TOMS' One for One model, they're able to give to those in need what is purchased through their company. Whether it's their trademark canvas shoes or providing sight with the purchase of their sunglasses, they're giving in tremendous amounts. That also includes giving a book away for every copy of \\"Start Something That Matters\\" purchased.  If that's not reason enough to buy the book, you'll be inspired by the stories and principles shared in this relatively quick read. I was surprised how much I got out of the book. I wouldn't consider myself an entrepreneur but while reading chapter after chapter, I was continuously challenged to think bigger than myself. If you have that entrepreneurial spirit already inside you, then this is a great way to help you harness that into ensuring a larger impact than just a bigger bottom line. And for those who want to make a difference in the world, this will only serve to further your desire and may even spark new ideas for ways to make what you love your livelihood.
B0064T6LV8|1.0|The app downloaded, installed and opened ok, but it won't progress beyond the menu screen no matter which onscreen buttons I tap on my Archos 43.  Not sure why Amazon says this app is compatible with it.  I don't have this problem with other apps I've downloaded from Amazon.
B005VR9328|4.0|For real fans of hip hop you may have missed the fact that The Roots released a new album called \\"undun\\". Its... ummm... too deep for most. Definitely not marketed towards the masses. But still worth a listen. Get one of your friends to burn you a copy. Buying it yourself might be a waste depending on what you are into.

B004APVI1G|1.0|Product review is for the LEGENDS OF GUARDIANS the Owls of Ga'Hoole  (Blue-Ray 3D + Blue-Ray + DVD + Digital Copy)<br />Not in the least bit happy about this.  The main reason I bought this movie was to have a digital copy.  Then I tried to input it in iTunes and iTunes tells me that the code has already been used.  And I can't return it now that it's \\"OPENED\\".  I hope the other 3 DVD combo packs I bought are not the same way other wise I will never buy another movie from Amazon.  If I could give this a 0 star review I would!
0307891372|5.0|I am a wargamer and SKYRIM is the first - first person action game that I have purchased in years.  The game is fantastic and the offical guide has become indispensable to solving some of the adventures whenever I have stalled out.  The guide is 656 pages and includes a fold out map of the province of Skyrim. I only reference it whenever I need information or assistance.  The guide does not tell you how to defeat the opposition.  Instead they give you hints as to the best tactics.  For example:  climb onto the cliffs and rain arrows down on the opponent in order to weaken it for your final confrontation.  The guide is easy to use and is worth the investment.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Amy Winehouse's postmortem release \\"Lioness: Hidden Treasures\\" is classic Amy. No changes. Sultry, thoughtful, emotionally raw, and provocative which is how we love(d) her. If you are not familiar with her work, she is definitely a \\"love it or leave it\\" artist. You either can't get enough of her or can't stand her. Try it.
B0036B4ETS|1.0|This is not a genuine battery, sold by \\"Best buy battery\\". Package of the battery arrived broken. Battery can not be charged. I definitely send it back.
B004ULNJIU|3.0|Action star Jason Statham goes at it again in BLITZ.  This time he's a loose cannon London cop on the trail of a serial cop killer.  He teams up with a gay inspector (Paddy Considine) and closes in on the psycho (Aidan Gillen), climaxing in a brutal showdown.<br />Underscoring the film is a poorly defined connection between Statham and Gillan's characters.<br />BLITZ is a strictly adrenaline-propelled movie, not really breaking any new ground and suffers from the thick accents that often become undecipherable.<br />Statham has a strong screen presence and Considine is effective, making BLITZ an okay actioner.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|rake's \\"Take Care\\" is a little cockier then it should be for a sophomore album. If you listen long enough you notice that he has spent way too much time with Wayne because he has picked up his stutter step flow style. Drake also shows us his \\"Busta\\" flow on more than a couple tracks which adds a hint of \\"interesting\\" to Drake's flow repertoire. Mostly, the album is whiny and \\"R&B-ish\\" which is not really the Drake that we like to hear a lot of. It still gets spins at my house though. Ask somebody to burn you a copy and save yourself $11.99   P.S. glad he left Cash Money. Maybe we can see more sides of Drake then what wwe have been seeing.
B001HN690O|5.0|I'm loving this movie, and it was worth buying the Blu-ray.  The picture is incredible!  The rocks and water look totally real and the detail on their fur was unexpected.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Excellent mmorpg, best available on mobile platform. Kindle Fire runs it perfectly. Arcadian Forest's server has a good population and helpful players.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|The first disc was not like the orginal film.  While not important in the long run, I would rather have the uncut version.  The second disc has also been \\"edited\\".  I wish that the description had included the words, edited or cut.

B000007WNN|5.0|Wow the Cult one of my favorite bands! Where to start? Ian Astbury, and Billy Duffy two amazingly talented and inseperatable musicians. The cult started out as a english underground rock band with punk roots and as they gained popularity Ian it seemed was constently being influenced by the world around him, changing his views and musical direction which apparently Duffy didnt always see eye to eye with but nether the less stuck it out and played his part well. After gaining most of their attention in the goth genre with songs like Santuary, and Here Comes the Rain , Ian again changed course and became infactuated with the American Indian culture and again another album.     The Cult came to the attention of American rockers with Electric and especially the song Love Removal Machine. Its my understanding that the popularity of ACDC and their style highly influenced Ian and Duffy to write the songs on Electric , leaving their mostly gothic roots and fans behind and entering into the pure rock genre. After reading this I highly agree, this is indeed a new Cult we were dealing with here. New music new appearance and a growing amount of new fan support, that more than made up for the saddened gothic fans who felt left out on Electric.     This is the best Cult album ever and it shows off both Astburys vocals as well as Duffys great guitar work. The only thing missing from Electric are the two songs Fire Woman, and Sun King from Sonic Temple. Fire Woman has one of the most amazing lead guitar works of all time, has anyone else not noticed that Duffy is almost constantly in lead all the way through this song. It belongs on Electric.     If you could only have one Cult album besides the Hits which does a great job of covering the Cult discography, Electric is the one to have hands down.
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you like spider solitaire, you'll love it.  It's a great version of it and works well on Kindle Fire.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|The movie arrived on time and It played well. I have seen this movie before and I enjoyed it this time as well .
B005LJK3AC|4.0|The premise of this film (based on the trailers put out by the studio) is straightforward and entertaining. Three employees tired of their employers decide to kill each others' boss. Throughout the first third of the film, I thought, \\"this is as gratifying as Hangover was.\\" But the more of the film I watched, the more apparent it became that that (consecutive \\"thats\\" not a typo) was not the case. The film is not bad, in fact, like my title conveys, the movie is actually good. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis mesh well together and their friendship is believable. Also, the supporting characters, Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and Jennifer Aniston, only make the picture stronger. Of all the actors in this movie, Kevin Spacey is clearly the better and more authentic artisan of them all. Everybody's seen a boss/coworker/friend/rival like this guy. Another positive is that this movie is not short on comedic material. There is a lot in every scene. This is good for people who either love to laugh or laugh easily. And a final positive of this movie is that this is a really good Friday night movie. It made me enjoy my Friday night.  Now for a few negatives. I have two major ones. The first detrimental quality of the film is that it didn't reach the potential that I felt it could've had and that was largely due to the writing. The writing for this movie is not witty or insanely funny. The film is not unfunny, it's just moderately funny. I genuinely laughed like two or three times total throughout the 106/107 minutes the film ran, three or four times total depending on whether you want to count the cut scenes that were playing during the closing credits (which is kind of strange because Colin Farrell was as funny if not funnier in the closing scenes that were edited out than he was in the actual movie). The second disagreement that I had with the film is that I had an internal feeling from start to finish as I was watching this movie that the film had been rushedso that it would be shown in theaters on short notice to capitalize on the anti-establishment/populous sentiment that was really high in this country with regards to the countless bailouts and unethical practices by Wall Street that eventually bought the entire world economy to a collapse. That feeling that I got of them of putting out an expedited product felt a little disingenuous to me. It's very apparent to me that I don't think they would've had the idea or motivation to make a film like this when the economy was better and people weren't out in the streets protesting.  If I could, I'd give this movie three and a half stars out of five, but since I can't, I decided to give it four stars instead of three partly because Aniston was crazy hot in this film. I'm not obsessed with her as I see many guys who know about her are. Personally, I'm into women who have a different body type than she does, and I don't generally find her light skin tone attractive either, but she was really hot here. The film also received four stars instead of three because as I mentioned above, it was a good way to spend a Friday night.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|Some of the songs are absolute knockouts. Instrumental breaks and fill-ins by Stills are perfect. One of the great guitarists.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's a great lay back and be puzzled game, relaxing and stimulating at the same time. I'm only half way through and it seems to be getting a little harder but not hard enough to where it makes you anxious trying to figure out the solution. If you achieve perfect solutions then you get coins to acquire in game solutions to the level. So even if you get stuck you can just &quot;skip&quot; the level in other words.   Also works very smoothly on my Kindle Fire.
0440241901|5.0|The book was interesting and fun and had the happy endings that I like but the end was very predicable although enjoyable.
0553386794|5.0|Let me first say, that I am not that big fan of a fantasy.  It usually doesn't appeal to me.  But a friend of mine recommended this book, so I took a chance on it.  Unbelievable.  Its a masterpiece.  Martin possesses an uncanny ability to tell a story through the eyes of characters that gives the reader a very non-fantasy feel to it.  The very descriptive emotions and traits portrayed are very relate-able to real life characters.  With this, he is able to capture the readers interest in the characters and uses it to build on a fabulous, complex plot that will leave you with great anticipation as you turn the pages.  And you WILL turn the pages.  Putting the books down are by far the hardest part.  Trust me, read the books.  You can thank me later.  :)
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I've never played chess and wanted to learn.  The look of this app seemed as realistic as possible.  After doing a Google search to teach me how to play, I'm really enjoying the game!  I appreciate having the &quot;Undo&quot; button when I play against the computer so that I can continue to learn what my misstep was and create better strategy.  I ended up doing pretty well playing against another person for the first time.  For a free app, you can't go wrong with this fun, addictive game of chess.
0553381695|5.0|After reading A Game of Thrones, I was cautiously optimistic about part 2 in the series, A Clash of Kings.  Man, was I surprised.  This book is just as good, if not better than the first.  Martin continues his trademark style of wonderful, complex story telling through the eyes of his many well built characters.  There are surprises aplenty. And the reader will find it extremely hard to put the book down.  In my opinion, A Clash of Kings continues building what could eventually be one of the great fantasy series of all time.
B000FC12C8|5.0|I was eager to use this books with my economics background to cleverly out think the market.  While not theorietically impossible, Graham tells us that trying is a fools errand.  The time involved and psychological challenges to being an enterprising investor are just too high to make sense.  Buying this book and hearing Graham describe the stock market for myself so that I could choose the path for myself was the best investment I'll ever make.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I purchased three of these covers in pink, grey and black at the same time that I ordered our Kindle Fires. There seemed to be supply issues with the pink version, it was shipped much later but somehow managed to arrive within a day of everything else.<br /><br />These covers are really good in terms of protection, one of these is for my 13-yr old son with autism, who loves gadgets but sometimes has accidents with them. I have already noticed some gouges on his case, yet the device is in pristine condition so at least it is doing its primary job.<br /><br />We have mixed feelings about the folding cover. My wife and myself are not exactly crazy about it, but our son loves it.<br /><br />The best part is that the price went down $10 since we ordered them, and Amazon kindly refunded the difference before we even noticed the price drop.<br /><br />After a month of intensive use, the three units seem to hold their color pretty well, and the fit of the case around the device is the same as in day one. I imagine that the elastic band will over stretch from usage, but after the first month this stretching is minimal.<br /><br />The weight of the case does not seem to alter the balance of the device, which is already heavy. It is not like when you have a Kindle 3 with a lighted leather case, which makes it about twice as heavy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love how easy the game is to play with the one click option and being able to undo your turn (because who doesn't when playing real solitaire?). I'm very happy with my free purchase :)
0141184388|3.0|The book cover is not the same.  It was a pretty beat up book, but still readable. If you're looking for light reading, I wouldn't pick this book.
B004I8WD6E|2.0|very disappointed overall with product...very difficult to put on/take off...damaged screen protecter putting stupid thing on!! worst case I've ever seen
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I have listened to audio books for over 10 years.  During that time I estimate that I have listened to more than 400 books.  I have never cared for Stephn King's books based on what I have read about the subject matter of each book.  As best I can recall, this is the first Stephen King book that I have done. However, this book intrigued me & I rate it among the best I have ever listened to.  I thought that it might dwell too much on the assanation of JFK but much to my surprise, only about 25% of the book was actually about 11/22/63, although it was alluded to throughout the book.  The rest of the book was extremely interesting & I highly recommended it to those of you that may have lived through the late 50's & early60's & enjoy some of the nostalgia of that time.
B0042LJTQO|5.0|I first bought this CD more as a study tool for learning Schubert on the piano.I recently bought all the Sheet-music on Schubert and now I needed the back-up help with the audio. I found Alfred Brendal's work to be smooth and clear for this purpose in mind.His talents sure go beyond learning an instument as his music has much precision and integity.If your a lover of melody and fun pieces, you'll enjoy this one, highly recommended, cheers!
B003L77G6A|5.0|Great DVD's and a great series. Contains all 24 episodes of Season 4 on 3 DVD's (8 episodes per DVD). Good DVD quality, same as the previous three seasons.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Just what I needed!  Replaced my regular alarm clock.  Excellent options.  Easy to use.  Could use cooler graphics but no biggie.  Great app.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|It's Firefly--of course it's good. The only complaint I have is this: I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and thought I'd be getting that nifty collector's box shown in the picture with it. Nope. I got a single DVD case with 4 DVDs inside. But hey, it's still Firefly. So it's good.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app, no need to watch Tv weather anymore. thanks for a nice free app. those having problems starting need to enter location and click the location from the list and should work.
B000FDVOXO|4.0|Quality extended version with two extra scenes (Kyle Reese visits Sarah in a dream scene) and an extension of John and Sarah reprograming the big fella.) Also we see more of Miles Dyson's house and that he has a daughter.    The director's commentary is insightful, as it was recorded in 2003, 10 years after the movie so he looks at it from perspective. He feels the movie still stands on its own merits and I agree. There is not as much CGI as you would think.  Linda Hamilton probably suffered hearing loss as she forgot to wear ear plugs during one of the takes in the elevator scene.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|the new lyrics showing is great. its like karaoke in your hand. I can sing along with my favorite songs.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a basic solitaire game, not glitchy. I could do without the ads but hey,  that's the price we pay when the app is free.
B003L77G6A|4.0|Though The Big Bang Theory is still must watch viewing for me, this season felt like something like a step backward from previous years. To be fair, this season has its' share of good moments like Howard's unfortunate incident with the robotic hand for example. I'm concerned that the producers moved too quickly from the original premise of the show of these super-smart guys who struggle to deal with the real world, I would've personally waited another year or two to carry out some of the developments persued in this season.  Concearning the actual DVD's: You get the season four episodes, three actor on actor features, a couple of Barenaked Ladies features (making of the theme song video & the actual video, and the customary gag reel.)If your a fan of the show or know one, they'll probably love this set, but this may not be the best season to introduce a new fan to The Big Bang Theory.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a useful utility that is easy to use. It helps to identify the source and strength of the signal when traveling.
B005HI7NP0|5.0|I almost can't put into words how much I love this album.  Every person I've played it for, regardless of their normal musical tastes has been blown away.  There is SO much soul in every one of these songs. The music sounds familiar, but fresh all at the same time, and you can't help but move when you hear it.  I've actually had to stop listening to it while I work, because I get completely sucked in and distracted from what I'm doing.  And that generally doesn't happen after I've listened to an album as many times as I have this!  And the song Grapes on a Vine?? wow, wow, wow.  Beyond amazing collaboration.
0060763280|5.0|I am truly getting a lot out of this book.  He gives the groundwork for how a millionaire thinks so anyone can implement it for themselves.  Its all about getting the right mindset.
0545123267|5.0|After reading some of the other reviews, I won't waste your time (or mine) recapping the story, but after having my head stuck in textbooks for the last 16 weeks, a recreational read is just what I needed. Light and fun, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait to start the next one. Just enough romance without being smut, just enough suspense to keep the pages turning, and plenty of enjoyment to opt to keep reading instead of sleeping when you have to be up in just a couple of hours and return to reality. Not everyone will enjoy it I'm sure, but I know that I certainly did!
B00631VJIC|5.0|i've had this cd for aweek and listened to it atleast 5 times. Patty Segall done a great job.Like ever song on the cd buy really like their veresen of House of the risen sun
1451648537|4.0|THIS BOOK  STARTS OUT INTERESTING,STILL READING. I AM SURE THE REST OF THE BOOK WILLBE GOOD.I HOPE TO FINISH AFTER OUR CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION IS COMPLETE
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I love these movies, and its really nice to have a set which contains them all. This set came in a single dvd case, about twice as thick as a standard case, with plastic pages that can be flipped like a book to find a specific dvd. This is nice, because I can have 8 movies in the space that is usually required for two.<br /><br />The internal part of the case that holds the pages and allows them to rotate was broken, when it arrived, and I have to be careful when selecting a disc. However, none of the discs appear to be damaged, and I got a great deal on the set, so I am not really bothered by it.
B005HSL626|1.0|ads are too frequent and gets in the way. plus app hangs very often trying to load feint or something. waste of time. uninstalled.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I was reasonably impressed with this album after the first few listens. But now that I've had it for a few weeks, I must say, it's a work of art. I would say it's definitely their best album yet, and that's saying a lot seeing as their first two are masterpieces in their own right. Standouts on this album are \\"Losing My Mind, Start of Something Good, Crazy, Crawling Back to You, and Who's They. The whole album is quite good, but those are definitely the stand outs. You have to get this album, you will not be disappointed!!!
B0053O89U6|5.0|Not only were these first two seasons half the price I would've bought them from Target; they are hilarious! I've already watched them twice. I've already pre-ordered the third season.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|My kids loved this item.  My daughters loved the movie because of all the music and the kids.  They also loved the music box that came with the kit.  Hell, I liked the movie also,  The vivid colors and the sound are great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really fun. I have been playing this on my kindle fire and have a hard time putting it down. Not bad for a free game at all.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop Remote Desktop works great on the Kindle Fire.  I have this app on my iPad and use it so I can remotely work the computer hooked up to my SMARTboard in my classroom.  One day I forgot my iPad at home, but I had my Kindle Fire.  I checked the app store and there it was.  I downloaded it and it worked wonderfully!  Now I just take my Fire with me to school, which is wonderful because the iPad takes up so much more space.  I would definitely recommend this app for anyone that wants to be able to remotely control their desktop, it's especially useful for working Powerpoint and SMARTboard presentations and switching between programs.
014241722X|5.0|Excellent book. A refreshing departure to come from an adolescent, future lawyer's view. I am most anxious to get started on the next one. Thanks!

B005OCFGTO|3.0|All of the movies were in excellent shape with no damage to them. However, the Prisoner of Azkaban dvd is not playing correctly. The picture fades in and out during the movie, but not on the title screen. This is the 3 Prisoner of Azkaban dvd I have had this issue with. There is definitely a manufacturer defect. Anyone else have an issue with any Prisoner of Azkaban dvd?
0061854549|5.0|Very well written book introducing the reader to the irrational aspects of our thinking and behavior. It challenges the classic economic theories and helps you better understand why we often fail to achieve our goals. A great read.
1593272790|5.0|This book is truly wonderful!  The detail that it demonstrates is fantastic.  Even my grown son enjoyed this book!  (A LEGO lover of yester-year!)  I certainly would recommend all three volumes - A great price for a great book!
0385535139|4.0|This book is an enjoyable Grisham story that never aims to reach the dramatic level of A Time To Kill.  Maybe Grisham just knocked this one off, but it still entertains.  I think he was actually aiming at comedy since his previous work has already completed the assault on lawyers and their ethics.  The characters in Litigators remind the reader of Leonard or even Hiassen, while admittedly not up to those standards.  What I don't see mentioned in these reviews is how very wrong this experienced author ([[ASIN:0385339658 The King of Torts]]) got the central medical issue.  On page 232 he writes, \\"The assault on Krayoxx was fueled by research purporting to show that the drug weakened the seals around the aortic valve, thus causing a decrease in mitral valve regurgitation.\\"  I'm sure that left the physicians among Grisham's fans chuckling.  He sort of confused the findings of sufficiency and insufficiency and a sentence later almost corrects himself, but for lay readers it probably suffices.  Was it a tongue-in-cheek, deliberate device to further highlight how ridiculous these suits can become?  Or did he simply mis-remember the information he collected for The King of Torts, a story that actually reported the facts around Fen-Phen rather accurately?  Lipitor (the template for Krayoxx), ton for ton, is currently the most prescribed drug in the world (milligrams at a dose).  If it became Krayoxx the dollars involved would dwarf even Wally Figg's delusions.

B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I own the whole series now and love every minute of it. Season 2 didnt go over well with some critics but I think it set alot of groundwork for the rest of the series. Alot of bad language and violence but if you can handle that this is a must watch. Lots of extras on the DVD. Give it a try.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|If you love incredible character acting, detailed and multi-layered story-telling this is the best series out there.  Remarkable on-spot historical fiction.  Need to watch from the beginning however to really enjoy.  Cant wait for next season.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|Very addictive app.  Funny combos, witty combos, and very easy combos.  Mix and match and play scientist.  Great time passer.
0762761296|2.0|I bought the hardcover version of this book in anticipation of a true story as riveting as \\"Escape from Davao\\".  Sadly, that is not the case.  Despite the claim on the cover, this story, told by Slavomir Rawicz, a Pole,  who collarborated with author Ronald Downing, an Englishman, and published the work in 1956, \\"The Long Walk\\" appears to be anything but true. Over the years, others have come to the same conclusion, including Peter Weir, the director of \\"The Way Back\\" a recently released movie which is based on this book. Weir himself admits there is no evidence to back Rawicz's claims and that it is likely Rawicz never participated in the \\"Long Walk\\". Perhaps the most truthful part of the book and therefore the most believable is early on in the story where during his trial Rawicz is confronted by the prosecutor who slaps him on the face and declares, \\"You are a professional liar\\" (page 19, \\"The Long Walk\\"). Regardless, the story evolves into an interesting fantasy of triumph over despair in which the characters, most of whom are of little or no substance, fade away. One need only look at the mischievious face of Slavomir Rawicz on the dust cover to see that it is he who has had the last laugh on all of us who paid to read his tale.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Does not work how it says it will.  Not worth the time or space for download.  I do not recommend this app.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I love this!  It makes my umbrella stroller so much more convenient to use.  I use it to hold my water bottles and drinks for my baby.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|`American Horror Story' is very graphic in violent content, sexual content and language. It is a show for adults. That in itself is refreshing. You never know exactly what is going on but you're scared and intrigued. The storytelling is so strong you trust enough to just enjoy the spectacle. Taissa Farmiga & Jessica Lange are stand outs among stand outs!
B00129H7VS|5.0|This was the best WW2 war movie I have ever seen.  AWESOME!  I would buy it as a gift for someone.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I love this movie! Cher (Tess) does a wonderful job, but I wish they had showcased more of her singing. Christina (Ali) wasn't really on my radar before this movie, but I really liked her acting and most of her singing. Cam Gigandet (Jack) was wonderful and I hope to see him in more and more movies. The storyline, although a little predictable, moved quickly and was well written.

B003H9M1QM|5.0|[[ASIN:B003H9M1QM Dumbo (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack in Blu-ray Packaging)]]  I got this for my gr-granddaughter for Christmas...her Mom said it would be perfect!  (for a 3 yr. old) They did have Blu-ray...........
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|It seems that almost all of Terrence Malik's films get some critical praise when they come out, but get heavily dumped on by the general public only to be hailed as a cinematic masterpiece years later. This latest foray appears to be no exception to that tradition. I saw it first in a short run, small theatre with a poor sound system which made following the diologue difficult to say the least...but visually, I loved it as much if not more than his prior films.   At the beginning of this Bluray, it is recommended that you turn the volume up loud for best effect...so I did. The second time, at home, with the sound cranked up, this film was 10 times better than the movie theatre experience. I tried to see what others have said negatively about this work (i.e., the lack of plot, storyline, self-absorbtion etc.)...just couldn't find anything remotely similar to those comments. I did find an incredibly beautiful and powerfully moving experience in a very unsentimental, unambiguous way. Tree of Life, to me, doesn't attempt to explain life as much as show how wonderful it is in all of its nuances and the questions it evokes. No one gets kicked in the head and there are no screaming gladiators (but there is a B-B gun scene). You'll find no memorable one liners or shocking blood lust violence here. The greatest works of fine art never reveal everything the first time around and it always gets better with each visit. There is not one second of wasted film and like every other Terrence Malik film, it gets better every time I see it. I'm glad I bought it!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I ordered Planet Earth cause I've seen a few segments and loved them.  I ordered the set to give to a friend for his birthday.  However, I never received the series that I ordered.  The seller sent the wrong CD set, and although they said to keep the wrong set and promised to send me the correct one,  I never got it, and was disappointed not to have it for the birthday gift. I'm now getting a refund and am very disappointed that this didn't work out.  Perhaps I'll reorder it from a different seller.
B0019MSM62|5.0|My parents had gotten this as a gift for my daughter when she was born (she's 10 1/2 months now) and I've seriously used it every single night. When she was first born, and not sleeping through the night at all, we just kept turning it on over and over to get her used to the music to calm her back to sleep. Originally we tried the rainforest sounds option, but it didn't do much for her. The music however is nice and calming and didn't bother us even though she slept in the same room. It goes through all three songs and lasts about 20 minutes, usually the amount of time it takes her to fall asleep. The remote makes it handy to switch it back on while we're still in bed or to pop in to turn it on from the living room. Since she's older we don't use the movement part of the mobile anymore, just the music but she still enjoys looking at them and hasn't fussed with them much when she stands so it's still there. When she was smaller the music and the mobile spinning helped her fall to sleep and it gave us the opportunity to tell her what the different animals were and the colors. I highly recommend this to anyone who's going to have a baby soon or as a great baby shower gift.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|i got the fire as well as this cover when they first came out and this cover looks awesome as well as has a good feel to it definitely worth getting
1451648537|5.0|Fascinating, in depth look into the life of a man that shaped history and technology as we know it.  I thought the different points of view shown by the various interviews was great, especially since it was revealed that Jobs did not have editing power.  The book was long but kept my interest.
B005KN5AES|4.0|Riot immortal soul is a must have for rock and roll fans a very well writen music CD and will satisfy fans of Riot
B004478GNI|5.0|What can I really say about Lego Star Wars toys- they are always a bit over priced but they are also much loved in our house! You can't go wrong with this purchase if you are a Star Wars & Lego fan!
B006HL9G10|5.0|I have this timer in all my devices,  was a little dissapointed when at first it was not offered here for the Kindle Fire,  but today, I checked again, and here it is!<br />I'm so happy!<br />thank you Amazon
B00002E233|4.0|This is the best Jaws-esc movie I have found in a while. So many movies try to get that thrill that jaws gave but fail miserably but this movie delivers. Even though I have watched jaws since I was 6 years old (now being in my 30's) this movie was able to give me that wonderful startling out of your seat jumping scenes that I love. Not really for kids due to visuals and language but still great. The only other movie that compares owuld be \\"The reef\\"
B0012GMUMC|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS CD FOR MY 22 YEAR OLD BROTHER WHO LOVES TOTO JUST AS MUCH AS I DO. THIS IS A GREAT CD. IT HAS ALL OF THEIR GREATEST HITS.
B00000I4XR|5.0|Not really much to say here since this is one of the most iconic movies ever made. Very well put together and has a few extras that are nice. The joys of us getting to let our daughters watch the movie for the first time is truely priceless. In relation to that apparently the back of the couch is a seat also since that is where our kids ended up about half way through the movie. A bit of caution though...In a certain scene a woman (Christy?) goes for a skinny dip swim and in most versions of the movie it is so dark you can't see anything. In this version it seems lit up a bit more and lets just say you could tell she really was fully nude. Just thought i'd add that since I didn't remember that from when I watched it so many years ago.
B002ZG983M|5.0|Kick-Ass is a great movie.  The movie is funny and still contains a great plot and a lot of great action scenes.
B00000IQC8|4.0|This movie takes all the standards and throws them out the window. While this movie is not for everyone (course language) it is very funny. It does take a while to get used to this movie being done in black and white but after a while you forget about it. It is very tongue firmly planted in cheek but so funny you won't want to miss it. As I stated it isn't for children or everybody but if youknow Kevin Smith's style then you will love his begginning movie.
0439023483|4.0|It was a really capturing book. That hooks you till the end.  Easy to read and ven easier to get lost into it and feel close to the characters and the things they go through.  Perfect summer reading!!!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I never have problem when purchase products from Amazon.com. Why? because they are care for customer and products & Shippingn & Handling are great too.
0307279189|3.0|After reading all the 5 star reviews I rushed to buy this book, but I found it frustrating to read. The story was backwards and forwards all the time with chapters digressing to barely relevant sidelines. Then there are those spiritual, philosophical arguments which are somewhat self indulgent.  The story of the race was a good yarn, but most of the time I was just wishing he would get on with it.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|I finally got my hands on this amazing DVD of Britney's latest tour \\"Femme Fatale\\" & I can't stop watching it. I'm a huge Britney fan & I think she killed it on this DVD. My favorite performances are \\"Hold It Against Me\\", \\"Up N' Down\\", \\"How I Roll\\", \\"Gimme More\\", \\"(Drop Dead) Beautiful\\", \\"If U Seek Amy\\", \\"S&M\\", \\"Trouble For Me\\" & \\"Till The World Ends\\". Nicki Minaj & Sabi also make special appearances during the show which is amazing. I do have some things I would like to say though especially to those who are writing negative reviews. I'm so tired of hearing people point out that Britney lip syncs. First of all, Britney has always lip synced for most of her performances. If you haven't accepted that by now, then there's no reason why you should have even bought this DVD or watched it. Us true Britney fans know that she does sing live sometimes & when she doesn't, we're okay with it because we know what her voice sounds like, we know that she's talented & we know she's going to put on one hell of a show. Plus you'd be surprised at all the other big artists out there that lip sync or sing to a backing track like Britney does most of the time. She did sing with a backing track during this show but the vocals were dubbed over for some reason. You can hear her in several parts of the show. Also, I'm tired of people saying that Britney can't dance like she used to. So what?! She's 30 years old now, she's had 2 kids which DOES change your body but she knows how to work what she's got & put on an amazing show. I was really impressed with alot of her dance moves & how much confidence she's finally showing again. I saw her on her Circus tour & she was amazing but you could tell she was a little nervous. Here, she's not nervous at all & she looks so happy. And to whoever commented that her dancers outshine her during \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", I really don't know what performance you were watching because she did the choreography perfectly & kept up with them at all times. She is Britney Spears, she's broken countless records, sold out countless shows & stayed on top for almost 15 years. She's a legend & an icon & if you're a Britney fan, you'll love this DVD. If you can't move past the lip syncing thing or the dancing thing, you just need to stop paying attention to Britney & find something else to do with your time.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Okay I love the story set up to this show it gets better each show. I just felt like damon was kind of a lost soul on the way and no one is really helping him except Elena. What's also amazing is that she could actually pick Stefan over Damon. I MEAN THAT'S FREAKIN CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DELENA ALL THE FREAKIN WAY!!!! HE'S FREAKIN HOT!!!!!!
B004EQAVHI|5.0|This is a superb film which stays faithful to the book by Kazuo Ishiguro. I do not wish to give the story away as the realization of what is happening is an important part for viewers but it revolves around a very important ethical issue. The acting is simply incredible all round. Be warned, you will cry, men and women and,  it will affect you for some time to come but it is well worth the heartache.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The appearance is gorgeous. The voice is excellent and it is very easy to store in my bag without and annoying
0312427646|5.0|Since I received this book for  Christmas a few years ago I must have bought it 30 times to give as presents. It is the perfect Christmas day read, drinking pop and waiting for the turkey to cook. It's laugh aloud but at the same time terribly poignant like all Bennett books. The great appeal as a gift is that it is suitable for all ages and ethnicities, from young adults up to those in their eighties. As I was wrapping copies yet again this year I was delayed as I just had to read my favorite bits again. Buy it, you will not be disappointed.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|I liked seeing the final chapter in the Harry Potter saga. It was, I believe, the darkest movie of the bunch, even darker than \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\".<br /><br />I know, I know, it's supposed to be good versus evil, but how convincing would someone who is evil be if it was always dark around them? Might that be a tip off? No, in my experience, evil usually presents itself in a more comely manner.<br /><br />I thought the movie suffered from what ailed almost all of the later movies, the movies based on big books, in that you really had to have read the book in order to understand (at least part of) the movie. These movies don't stand on their own; they are like in jokes that you must know a certain something in order to get.<br /><br />These movies also suffered from taking too long to make, and the characters aged far too much for the supposed time spent. It's too bad that the films couldn't have been made much closer together, even if they were released later. The three main characters looked a lot better in the first movies than in the end.<br /><br />Speaking of the end, I thought this movie's end was a let down, a petering out rather than a finish. The movie seemed to be going through the motions, the obligatory motions at that.<br /><br />Yes, I have criticisms of this movie, but I'm pleased it finally came out. Nevertheless, it would be nice if there were more movies like the first two Harry Potter movies, with more awe and wonder. Kids grow up and many become troubled and sullen, shy, self-conflicted, and unsure, but I an not certain that makes for good movies.<br /><br />Of the three main characters, in the movies, only Hermione (Emma Watson) did a credible job throughout. Radcliffe is sometimes difficult to watch, especially in his non-HP roles I have seen. Ron (Rupert Grint) is okay, but never as good as he was when younger. And, sadly, there was too little of Maggie Smith in the last movie. Her role took an enormous hit in the editing, it seems.<br /><br />It's too bad Peter Jackson didn't make these movies.
B0060D15AK|5.0|This is a great movie and you don't have to worry about little ears and eyes catching parts of the movie. It is filled will all kinds of laughs and surprises. I have watched it many times and it doesn't get old.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|This is the third time I\\"ve bought this same, exact watch. My husband is rough on watches and this one has been proven to be the most durable, and reliable, watch he's owned. Looks good too
1451627289|3.0|The book was okay, I thought he could have cut out 83% of the romantic mush to tie it together in the end. It had 10 minutes of action for every 900 minutes of romance. I didnt mind the romance, but, it got old.   I really wanted King to get the point of book instead of reading a drawn out love story. In the end Jake finally made the decision to repair the past and it happened in five minutes.   Its not a bad book, its 'okay'
B0055SWM08|4.0|Very zenlike yet addicting. I can't seem to pit this one down. The waterdrop backdrops are very soothing as well.
B004S9OYBA|1.0|I have always been a fan of THE CORRS....well before their hit \\"Breathless\\". I even traveled to BOSTON to see them live. I was unhappy when they broke up but HEY, they gave us a good ride. When I had heard that Andrea (and even Caroline) where cutting LP's, I thought, \\"This will be great!\\" Until I heard THIS ALBUM. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE CORRS...DO NOT BUY THIS CD!<br />Save yourself some money and buy another CORRS LP or Video cus THIS CD will ruin your opinion of Andrea, much like it did mine.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I've enjoyed Coldplay music on the radio but never purchased any of their music until now.  While music shopping on Amazon I came across this CD along with several others and decided to take a chance.  WOW - really surprised at price and how fast my selections were shipped.  Thank you Amazon and the seller of this CD.
B003XQG0JI|2.0|So having been ready to loose all respect for the CORRS, after hearing Andrea's last two albums, I couldn't wait to see what Sharon's debut would sound like. I must admit it does sound a little more like the CORRS, in places, but still, it falls a little flat. I will admit that since the band broke up to pursue families, I have been wishing for some solo efforts on their parts but both sister's have not even come close to the quality and focus that was their previous band's<br />It's sad because I am sure they both want to distance themselves from the band but let's face it...WHY ELSE WOULD WE WANT TO EVEN BUY THESE LP's IN THE FIRST PLACE?? Do you yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS CD or her sister's and go listen to an old CORRS cd.
B000WS4PCO|5.0|I've been wanting this CD for a long time but just never got around to it.  Price and convenience of purchasing through Amazon was excellent.  I absolutely cannot complain about price - shipping time - quality of CD or anything else associated with the purchase.  Kudos to Amazon and to the seller of this CD for making this such a smooth purchase.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Does everything I need it to when I need it.  It is almost as good as using the real thing.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Saw this movie with a friend, HAD to see it again with our children. I think every family in America needs to see it with their children. So many points of discussion can come from this wonderful film.  I haven't read the book yet, but will shortly.

0880793589|4.0|If you're finding yourself stuck on a project, or just can't seem to get started, I'd recommend you purchase the Creative Whack Pack.  Each card represents a different action you should be taking, and one of them is \\"ask a fool\\"... Well, this fool's telling you it's worth your time.<br /><br />It will help you move your projects forward, look at things differently, and even (as one of the cards recommends) Get rid of excuses.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|Bought this app yesterday after trying out the free version for a few weeks. Free ver. worked ok, but the one I paid for keeps freezing.  I realize there are no refunds for apps, but this is not the first time I've had a problem with an app from Amazon.  I have a Viewsonic gTablet, running Android 2.2, and some apps install even if they won't work properly.  I think Amazon needs to at least have a provision for refunds for incompatible apps.  If it was working right, I'd give this at least 4 stars.  Update (1/14/2012):  I can't believe this is still available.  I thought it might have been updated and fixed by now, so I tried to download it again, about 2-3 months after the first time, and it still is freezing.  Now when I open it it takes me back to the Amazon Appstore page, then locks up.  Seeing all the 1-star reviews, I had to downgrade my review from 2 stars to 1.  I'd give it zero if Amazon allowed it.  Don't waste your time or money with this piece of junk.  Maybe Amazon will get the hint and remove it altogether.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|Let me preface my review by saying I own Puzzle Quest 2 in at least three other formats.  However, I am glad that I overcame my hesitation and picked it up again as this game is a perfect fit for the Kindle Fire.  Graphics and sound are as I remember and the game-play is as impeccably balanced and as fun as ever.  Puzzle Quest 2 sets a great example as to the quality I hope to see from developers in the future. Bravo Namco!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I've tried all the major players - Google reader, pulse, netvibes, pageflakes, taptu, easy rss, etc.  In my opinion, Feedly is by far the best news aggregator. It's also one of the only ones that works on your phone, tablet, AND the desktop.

B000MTDRKE|5.0|If you're Catholic, please forgive me. The album's title is the reason I picked this up, because I strongly believe this is an important issue. (In fact, I wrote lyrics with the same title.)<br /><br />Let me start with the music. AWESOME! I've read some of the other reviews (after listening to this myself) saying this is not Morse's best project. Fine, I can't argue not having listened to his other projects. But I consider this one of the best albums I've heard, based on the artistic aspect. I like the recurring themes in the instruments.<br /><br />The structure is reminiscent of side B of Abby Road (the Beatles). There are four tracks, but only one of those tracks consists of a single song. The other three have six songs/instrumentals each. This adds to the operatic feel.<br /><br />Now, let's look at the message. Is this a Catholic bashing project? Some think it is while others (like myself) realize the fact it isn't. Reading the lyrics and the notes Morse has at the end, his point is that there is need for reformation in all churches. One reviewer has sources that Morse is Arian, which puts him at odds theologically not just with Catholics but Protestants as well. Morse has a call to come out of Babylon, but one can ask if he's referring to the traditional church (Protestant as well as Catholic) -- others have that view.<br /><br />His message is controversial and may be opposed to some who would agree with the theme of this project (like myself). But let's get back to the project. I can find encouragement in the lyrics where I'm in agreement, and even though the disagreements may be strong between us, I can still benefit from it. Musically, you have a quality project.
B004WCTLNY|1.0|Interesting idea, but poorly carried out by production team and or directors,  Mr. Damon struggles to make a story work, some good scenes
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|There have been many great female voices over the Decades. But rarely do one's come along that embodies an Amazing Voice, a Beautiful Soul and an Awesome sense of Likability. It's difficult NOT to like Kelly, with her effortless singing talent added with a Texas Charm, Kelly will go down as one of the VERY FEW who will be known as a True Singer, not a Studio made voice. You'll be hard pressed to find someone who can sing LIVE better than Kelly. I LOVE her and will buy Anything she will put out!

086571701X|5.0|After spending much of the past 20 years researching and exploring the technical & applicable aspects of hydroponics, aquaponics, & urban farming, I found it refreshing to discover a book that is as much an enjoyable read as it is a valuable resource.  Blending her extensive personal experience with knowledge compiled from her equally impressive international network, Sylvia astutely begins with a section on the problems facing our planet and why aquaponics provides so many solutions.  Comprising the bulk of the book is a solid foundation toward understanding how it works and the information to empower the reader to get started in a truly sustainable method of food production.  Another review of this book contends that it is not step-by-step enough.  I have read every book I'm aware of on aquaponics, and am definitely a \\"nuts & bolts\\" guy myself. While this book isn't packed with detailed schematics, it is important to understand that the current state of aquaponics is one in which tinkering and epiphanies lead to innovation nearly every day.  No one would know this better than a person who maintains an aquaponics site with home pages held by thousands of hobbyists, techies, and large/commercial scale growers alike (as Sylvia does).    That said, Aquaponic Gardening certainly offers extensive information on the current elements being used to build practical and efficient aquaponic systems.  For a rapidly growing global population in need of real solutions, Sylvia Bernstein offers a  timely and definitive work in Aquaponic Gardening.
037582913X|5.0|This was my favorite book as a child.  I loved it so much, I thought the standard Little Golden Book would make a nice stocking stuffer at 4 bucks a pop, for friends and family of any age.  Then I stumbled on this... the BIG Little Golden Book.  I did buy a \\"backup\\" copy of my original a while back, but had no idea there was a BIG version.  So, in my 40's, I am here to say I bought this for myself, my big hands, and any time a monster in my life scares me, I will have this riveting resource at hand.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|I got this to replace my regular hairspray dvd because I wanted the extras.  My original became a christmas gift for my niece, who will most likely watch hairspray twenty times a day now since it's one of her favorite movies.  Thanks!
B004EPYZSK|1.0|Love Westerns; Love Syfi; Love Daniel Craig; Love Olivia Wilde; Still like Harrison Ford. Mix them all together and you have...'a mess' in my opinion. Its hard to believe this ever got made. I watched the extras/behind the scenes shorts first and knew it was a stinker by the way the Actors were trying so hard to convince themselves this was going to be a great film--not! It could have been a decent Western if they'd wanted (Daniel Craig is Steve McQueen reincarnated) or fairly good 'Aliens are here to kill us movie', but in combo it totally didn't work for me. I only watched it all the way thru cause I pd $20 for it new from Target, but I'll never watch it again!
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I used about 20 Headphones total, and out of all the Over head headphones, Ill pick this one.Im surprised that this headphones only 30~40$. Ill probably pay about 20~40 more for this headphones. Its really Stylish plus the sound quality is amazing. If i have to pick one con, its the comfortably. The Comfort level on this headphone i have to give a 6/10 since it gives pressure to your head. However, this might me a pro since it blocks the outside noise. Now lets move on to built quality. The built quality is pretty amazing too. Its stable, durable, and it feels like it'll last long. Even the cables are pretty thick which makes it last longer then usual headphones.  I recommend these headphones for DJ's,Music producer etc. For avg music listeners, beware that the cable itself is pretty long, so you might have to tie it or just shove it in your pocket.Overall I give this headphone a 4.7/5.0 since its stylish,Really good sound quality for a 35$ headphone, and built quality.

B000SW2F6M|5.0|I love Ridley Scott. Please watch the Director's Cut (194 minutes). The film is richer & more coherent. It goes from three stars to 4+ in the longer cut. I take off a smidge because there are other actors I would have preferred in Orlando Bloom's role. And, face it, if you're going to watch an historical epic, you want it over 3 hours. Please just let the man work. Beautiful movie, great production, trademark Ridley Scott panoramic shots that look like giant moving oil paintings. Amazon, you suck a little for not offering the Director's cut on Instant Video. Fix this please.<br />As of March 2013 Amazon has made this situation WORSE by listing a link from this Dvd of the director's cut (at 195 minutes) to their instant video offering which should be noted is the theatrical release at 145 minutes.
6305428042|5.0|This is one of my favorites, i highly recommend this. I watch this very frequently. It is a great movie!
0743297334|1.0|This book should not have been for sale.  It had underlined sentenances on almost every page.  It had names on the outside.  It was not a good book.  The first and second pages had writing all over it.
1609611543|5.0|I'll be brief - Dr. Davis could have written this just for me (52 yr old male 230 lbs and 6 ft tall).  After the first few pages I decided to stop eating wheat completely as an experiment.  I noticed results THE NEXT DAY.  I'm not a fanatic and sorry for shouting but it's very exciting: in the shower where I'd feel a handful of fat I'm beginning to feel bone and muscle again and I'm doing absolutely NOTHING.  I don't miss the bread etc.<br /><br />More importantly I have a good glucose meter I've been experimenting with and my morning reading is usually above 110 or so, enough to get me thinking I need to see my MD and start down \\"that road\\".  Yesterday I had a big, but wheat free, breakfast and 3 hours afterwards my sugar was 72!  SEVENTY-TWO!  It's never been that low, and has been much higher at times.  I'm not nearly as stiff as I used to be, and after 10 days I feel great.<br /><br />Please try this, or at least give up wheat products whenever you can and see what happens.

0060873086|4.0|Michael Crichton from day one enthralled us with tales of impossible worlds which happen to exist just out of the reach of our own senses. We marveled at a group of scientists was barely hanging on when pitted against velociraptors in [[ASIN:0345370775 Jurassic Park]]. Here however another group of scientists learn to feast on katydid steaks and are tortured by wasps. Shrunken to half the size of a peanut and dumped in a Hawaiian rainforest by an evil entrepreneur these young kids struggle to live in a world they have taken for granted.  Okay so it's not Crichton's best; it is his last. Richard Preston, the author of [[ASIN:0385495226 The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story]] is brought in to finish Crichton's last novel. While it is a bit fanciful, atoms also get shrunk, and the love scenes are about as convincing as Rock Hudson wooing Doris Day, the idea is interesting. We may be at the top of the food chain but we would be soul food to an ant if only we were bug sized.  And parents, when your college kid changes majors from sports administration to entomology, you will know he or she has been doing some recreational reading.

B004P8JPS6|1.0|I have read each and every one of the Reacher novels.  This was most disappointing and predictable.  I have found that best selling authors, with few exceptions lose their creative edge when they are no longer worried about paychecks.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Nice for single location but prefer WeathrBug for travelling because more intuitive for multiple locals.  i always liked AccuWeather for accuracy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|super addictive game. love the choice of pictures on the cards.  the computer doesnt let you have it easy either.
B000Q7ZO8U|4.0|The product:  Product description accurate; received in excellent shape in time specified.  The movie:  4 out of 5 stars when compared to holiday movies such as Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th; on par with Elf. Enjoyable Christmas movie to watch with pre-school/Kindergarten-age kids.  Lots of music, interesting animation, and a good lesson to boot.  Also consider the book so you can read the book since you're not going to watch the movie repeatedly.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I loved loved loved this book. It was recommended to me by a co-worker who said she was shy about recommending it. I am so glad she overcame her shyness! Everyone in my building has now read or is reading this book. We laugh among ourselves that we are reading porn but this book is way more than that. Enter the world of Anastasia Steele. An innocent until she meets a very rich young man named Christian Grey. Christian is a different from any man she has met. His world is so out of the norm and he wants to make Anastasia a part of it. Fall into the world of submission and dominance. This book is not vulgar, it is so well written I am seeking out others by this author. The girls and I laugh in secret that our husbands are benefiting from our love of this book and its characters.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|The product:  Product description was accurate; product arrived in time specified in excellent condition.  The movie:  definite classic with great music and entertaining animation.  Great family movie with some delicate themes for kids (death, evil) that require discussion.
B0000549B2|5.0|Very good DVD, the movie if filled with a amazing cast, its also funny at times. The ending is also cool.
1592332803|5.0|I absolutely love this cookbook! The recipes are easy to follow, and the ones I've made so far have been really, really good. I highly recommend this cookbook to anyone who is serious about their sweet tooth! It will not disappoint!

0061122416|5.0|How many times will I order another copy of this book? Seems like I'm constantly needing one to give as a gift. The book was in great condition, at a suberp price, and shipped ever so quickly. Couldn't have been happier.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno Mars is just simply amazing. Everything he touches is brlliant. First of all, Just The Way You Are is fabulous and the perfect song for building a woman's self-esteem. Grenade is heartfelt, powerful and full of love. Marry You is probably my favorite! It's fun, bouncy and corny romance all in one. It will instantly get you hooked from the 1st listen. On this album, I found myself liking every song :) Bruno Mars is the best, he's got a long career ahead of him. I <3 <3 <3 Bruno Mars.
0545265355|5.0|This trilogy is absolutely awesome.  I saw something on the net saying that the 1st book is coming out as a movie in 2012 and that it will be the next big thing.  So, I thought let me read it first and when I went to Amazon and saw that there were 3 books I ordered the set.  I finished all 3 books in 1 week.  You really get swept up in this story.  I just can't say enough how much I enjoyed these books.  At times they can be a little dark, but who doesn't like that sometimes.  These books are not about Sunshine  and Rainbows.  If you like futuristic odd scenarios then these books will be for you.  Our planet is getting so crowded that at some point population control will have to happen.
B005EZJ3MW|3.0|so we all know this was going to be demis big come back and it didnt disappoint!  the album as just about a little of everthing for everone. i think this is her best album yet. her last were good but they all had more of the pop/rock vib not that this one dont but it has less of what the others had and more diffrent.   1.

0740797719|5.0|I have many books about paintings as well as books on how to draw and paint.  This is the only book that excites me enough to get me to take up a paint brush.  This book is full of beautiful color illustrations.  It provides countless practical tips that are easy to understand. It covers topics such as Old Master's Color, Magazine Illustration, Direct Sunlight, Overcast Light, Window Light, Candle and Fire Light, Indoor Electric Light, Street Light and Night Condition and many many other practical and useful tips.  It is impossible not to paint better after reading the book.  It is a useful reference for any casual as well as professional painter.
B005O9BB8W|5.0|Is this Five Finger's greatest album? Who cares?!? Is it fun and filled with some stomach clenched intensity? Yes it is. Mostly, this album seems to be addressing criticisms lodged against the band members, both on a personal level and on a professional level. To me, this is an album i can listen too without interruption, and will sit in the car just to finish one of the songs. For me though, i prefer to mix and match songs from various albums, and the songs here fulfill that desire as well. Maybe i want some War is the Answer followed by some Wicked Ways. Eminently possible and acceptable.<br /><br />To me, this is an excellent album, and i have zero regrets purchasing it. I listen to it often.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005HQ5S3G|1.0|I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this CD. Kelly is one of my favorite artists. I rooted for her on Idol and have purchased every CD she's made. This is the first one that won't go on my iPod. There's only two songs I like. Next time I'll download by song instead of buying the CD. Sorry, Kelly. I know you'll do better next time around.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Lou Reed? Sure! Love the guy! That \\"Metal Machine Music\\" album? One knee-slapper of a \\"kick-in-the-nuts\\" to the music biz. Metallica? Love 'em. \\"Death Magnetic\\" just keeps getting better and better with every listen. This \\"collaboration\\"? Shambles. Nightmare. Noise. Gibberish. The music has no direction though the riffage is still cool. The prob here's Mr. Reed. As poetry, the lyrics are truly wretched. As lyrics, they're cadence-less, distant and repugnant. Reed knew how to make ugly interesting, especially on albums like \\"New York\\" and \\"Growing Up In Public\\". Heck, even \\"Berlin\\" sounds cheery next to this! His \\"singing\\"? Elsewhere. Mostly, he recites. In a voice that's ramshackle, hesitant, brow-beaten. I was suckered in by the Rolling Stone praise-worthy sticker. Don't believe a word of the hype. Believe the opinions of the 1 star writers here. A disservice to both acts' fans. Yet another sad reminder that the traditional music industry truly is in intensive care and on respirators.
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|Negative reviews seem to focus on two main points: a) fitting the battery into the mouse, and b) charging it up. I read the negative reviews and decided to go for it anyway, since I'm tired of buying batteries. The battery pack fit fine and the plate on the bottom that mimics the original battery cover fit fine. It charged up fully in about 4 hours, and I've been using it for a week (mixed with a magic trackpad) without ever turing it off, and it's at 85%. The current capacity of USB ports varies, so possibly charging difficulties might arise depending on what the pad is plugged into. I plugged mine into my new MacBook Pro, and that worked great.  Overall, it's a bit expensive. A standard set of AA batteries would last me about a month, so it would probably take years to pay for it in battery savings. But the convenience of not having to worry about it makes it worthwhile. You certainly don't have to worry about remembering to put it on the charger every single day. It's looking like once a week would be more than enough.
0385344325|5.0|Jack Reacher is a complex character, a unique blend of cunning intellectual with purely raw rogue male instinct running underneath, like a deep, dark, silent current. Even within the branch of the military of which he was a part of in the years leading up to and including 1997, which is when this recall story takes place. His job description would best be classified as a guy the high ups send in when they need something stopped, when it's last resort time. Child's has spun a tale here, an extremely plausible thriller, with wrenching twists and radical turns, sub-plots that run seamlessly along and threaded into the overall plot and arc in all the right places. And, in a 1st person narrative that, as a writer, caused me to actually re-read many paragraph's to brand on my brain what this author just pulled off in terms of skill level. The back roads of Mississippi and a small town surrounding a special forces Army training base are the backdrop, with maybe a little fun-in-the-sun in DC for locational musical chairs - within the hallowed halls of the Pentagon, of course - and a couple of road trips done the hard way by our hero. These make up the general outline. Description in this book is absolutely stellar along with a hard smack of a plot line, and, for me Child's has again raised the bar in this my favorite fiction genre. If you're a hard-core thriller fan I highly recommend this book.<br />If you're a writer then fasten your seat belts kids. Narrative and dialogue and particularly description will have a whole new meaning for you as a writer. Readers are in for a thrill ride in terms of translated action and vivid imagery.<br />Jack Reacher is on the hunt for a killer who has an appetite for beautiful young women.<br />Child's, at one point early on, describes his character Reacher,or rather Reacher is doing the talking, in 1st POV, standing by a railroad track (in the course of the investigation), close, just feet away from the tracks, as a train approaches and then blasts past him. It's a multi-sensory masterpiece of a scene. In another spot (they're all through this book) where the mother of a murdered girl, in the doorway of her little shack, acts and reacts to news of any progress in her daughter's murder case and this too is a passage that you will never forget.<br />Maybe I just woke up on another level just before I began this book or maybe this book transported me to the lofty world of a bestselling author's perspectives and understanding but I am seriously impressed with Lee's work here and yes, it deepens the story to such a level that even as a well-read writer I feel it's affecting my own writing just having been exposed to this exhibition of skill.past him.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|The Final Cut is far and away the best Pink Floyd album ever.  Yes, it is a Water's album and his later stuff is relatively weak, but this album is both subtle and powerful.  I've literally listened to this album hundreds of times and I never tire of it.  The transition from \\"hold on to the dream\\" into the sax (and I generally hate the sax) is one of my favorite moments in all of music.  Those who have heard it know exactly what I am talking about.  The Final Cut is mostly about conflict and the consequences of it.  Again, subtle and powerful, I can find no better words to describe the album.  Easily one of my top 10's of all time.
B006470HZ6|5.0|Seeing as how this show isn't about racking up an undead body count it is nice to see the characters interacting. This show, especially this episode does a great job of creating drama, it is an art in story telling as we constantly see character development, drama, suspense, etc. Many people, however, watch this show and think it is all about killing zombies. It isn't, to quote Robert Kirkmam \\"it is really about how this world changes people.\\"
B003Y5H5FQ|4.0|I dont usually care for remakes of 80s horror movies. Cant think of one that was good. This movie surpassed my expectations. The 3d was one of the best ive seen to date. I own every 3d blu ray movie that is avalible with the exception of step up 3d.
0307593312|4.0|Many good reviews. So I will share 4 observations, three perhaps unique. 1) The writing is great with fantastic imagery of circumstances and action. 2) The style is first person multiple character observation. So each chapter there could be rehashing of elements already known to the reader from another character.  The irony is that one of the lead characters is an author hired to edit and make the story as concise as possible.  At 900+ pages, the repetitive perspectives of the actual author had me chuckling.  Perhaps this is the author's own confession of something he wishes he could do. 3) The story ending is so Japanese, so don't expect a big bang - they rarely happen.  4) This book does have many sexual moments, more heavy early in the story. While the discussion is very frank, it is polite to not go on and on and on.  Worth a read, but not for young readers.
B004EPYZTE|3.0|Ive been a big fan of conan for a long time. movie is pretty good, 3d is average. dosent hold up to the original movie.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|Bought the MP3 product, then tried to download it with Amazon MP3.   But it would NOT work.  Next day, discovered that it's for Android phones!  Whoops.  And of course, no refunds on downloads.  Does it say Android base ONLY anywhere when you view the download options?? NO.  Thanks, Amazon. Now I'll try to get my money back through my charge card company.

B0055CJ8T2|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this CD. I LOVE Kelly to pieces. She has an amazing voice coupled with a beautiful body and is finally allowing the world a peak into her. No more of the trying to be like Beyonce'. Which is good, because I can't stand Beyonce'. The basslines in most of the songs (not the slow ones) is easy to move to and the lyrics are awesome. I'm glad she included Commander on this release as I wasn't a big fan of that Guetta guy she did it with, but the song is good. I'd much rather have her CD. I would say 7 out of the 10 songs are songs that I actually saved the hard drive in my GPS. 1 of the other 3 is there too just not as a fave leave 2 I didn't care much for. Given todays CD releases that's pretty darn awesome.   I truly hope she keeps allowing herself to grow as an artist and not focus on what B is doing. Kelly is far to talented to be in someone elses shadows.   Trains on a Track will always be my favorite song of hers, but this CD certainly adds to the list.
0385344325|1.0|I have read all of Child's books.  Most of them are fantastic. This is not one of the good ones.    What usually takes Child 2 sentences to say took 4-5 pages in this one.  Literally, nothing happened  for the first 80 per cent of this novel.  Obviously, Child milked the hell out of characterizations, setups, descriptions, and anywhere else   he could because the core story would not have made a very good short short story...much less a novel.  Skip this one and hope Child hasn't sold out, like so many other authors do after they are successful.
630463949X|5.0|As these artists matured, they did not leave old abilities behind. In fact they just added texture to what was already good music. Christine McVie really shined as she moved the group through its classics, a couple of newer pieces, and -- yes, wait for it -- two numbers with the USC Marching Band. The DVD is fun with not a sour note in it. Visiting with old friends has never been more fun.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I love this movie! Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman are just wonderful, and the animation when one looks closely at the humor found with the animator can be adorable. The wisdom of the turtle and the entire film can be extrapolated into life and difficult circumstances as well learning to wait and find one's place. The soundtrack especially \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" and instrumentals are perfect and the colors in the film have such purity. It is a great watch and dance with your child.
B0055SWM08|5.0|the more levels that you achieve when playing quell, the more fun and challenging it becomes!  the hints you accrue, do provide the solution rather than addressing current status in a level -
B0000042MY|5.0|Ever listen to a soundtrack that can flow through the veins especially during a time of competition, vindication or vengeance? Sometimes I listen to the soundtrack while dicing potatoes and the Elk Hunt or The Battle can give focus and clarity to a difficult situation. The Last of the Mohicans is a beautiful soundtrack and of course the listener wants longer tracks and sometimes shorter for a few. Since the original purchase, I have breathed in the music deeply.
1419702238|5.0|I purchased this book for my son for Christmas as he'd been asking me for this book for quite a while. The book arrived earlier than expected (which is awesome) and in mint condition! I know that my son will be more than happy on Christmas day! I will most definitely purchase from this seller again!!
B004GHBQPG|5.0|This is J.R. Cash's last album; the chords, lyrics and depth to this man breathe soul. One can hear his age in the songs yet it speaks of man who lived life and found love only having to let go too soon. The album has 12 tracks and my favorites are Help Me, G-d's Gonna Cut You Down, If You Could Read My Mind, Further On Up The Road, I Came To Believe, Rose Of My Heart, and Four Strong Winds.

B004EPYZT4|1.0|Yeah, and the producers/writers/director/whomever clearly do not understand the character or stories of Conan hence they do not wield it effectively. As a Sword & Sorcery film it was okay, at best. As a Conan story it was terrible. As with the Milius version we get yet another sentimental version of the character. Conan was many things in his fictional career, indeed he has been a thief, pirate, military and mercenary Captain, even a desert chieftain and finally King. But sentimental? Nope, sorry. Given my experience of reading the character I feel Conan would view sentimentality as a weakness.  I knew something was wrong during the narrative intro by an oddly misplaced Morgan Freeman voiceover (the first time I didn't like him in something). The voice over started off correctly but then deviated wildly from the history of Hyborea. Conan is made to stand out as something special, unique and somehow important. This time he is gifted with near superhuman skills and abilities which takes away from the excitement as you never feel like Conan is ever in danger of actually losing (even though you know he won't) let alone getting injured or suffering. The written character of Conan was not unique, different or special. He actually was an outsider and his father and exile. At fifteen he (for the most part) ran away and eventually sought his fortunes farther south. Conan, at its heart is an everyman tale (if an arrogant everyman). He is not heroic, although his actions could surely often be interpreted as such but more often than not was seeking to better his lot while furthering his ambitions. Mostly he was just a man that kept growing, surviving and gaining skill all though his life until he achieved his goals in Aquilonia and even then had some more adventures. This, to me anyway, makes for a much more identifiable and interesting character.  A note on comparisons versus the 1982 Milius version: Neither of the films are very good Conan films but Milius' worked so much better as a Sword & Sorcery film for various reasons. One being that Conan in that film actually suffered more than once and was in no way superhuman. This one seemed to lack a sense of continuity and I felt like I was simply being dragged from one set piece to the next with little time to reflect on anything. Heck, even the sex scene seemed like a set piece.  A note regarding Jason Momoa: I do think he COULD make a good Conan but I do not think he made a very good one here. Not sure if this was his or the director's fault but running through a film constantly looking angry really makes for a bland hero. Even Arnie got to show a wide range of facial emotions in the Milius version. It may seem like a small detail but it does go a long way to humanizing the character.  Cast notes: Stephen Lang was good as a bad guy. Much more complete a character than Avatar (where he played a pretty one dimensional soldier) and overlooked by Hollywood for too long.  Ron Perlman: Please, I would watch Ron Perlman sitting alone in a room for two hours. He makes EVERYTHING he is in, better.  Rose McGowan, initially, I didn't like her in this, she was weird, creepy and disturbing. But then I realized that is EXACTLY the kind of bad guy witch woman I would want in a Sword & Sorcery flick. I have changed my stance on her and liked her in this film.  Rachel Nichols: Not really needed here. Not that I disliked her, just didn't care for her character and she seemed little more than the \\"love interest contrivance\\" for the script. Still, with that bit of a part, I admit she did exude charisma.  A few more notes: The filmmakers apparently pulled from the eight decades of comics and stories as well as the Frank Frazetta images rather than the hugely popular 1982 movie. Yet, the story is VERY similar both in plot and theme to the 1982 one. What the what? Comics and images? There seems to be this major disconnect between what a comic is and how it is interpreted by Hollywood in general. A comic does NOT show the moments in-between, this is something our brains do and it is called closure. Movies rarely have that luxury as they are moving pictures and the in-between (at least within those moments) is laid out for us. Hollywood, in general, clearly does NOT understand what a comic book is. Also, many of the SSoC were based off of L. Sprague DeCamp and Lin Carter stories. What about the guy that created Conan? Remember him? Robert E. Howard. Does his original work have so little merit or influence despite being the actual creator!?! I would argue that the original literary work from Howard (or DeCamp or Carter for that matter) had much influence at all.  Final note: Ultimately I was bored watching this film. So much so I had trouble even watching the third act, compounded by the fact that it was the worst of the three. (Stephen Lang did make a great villain though) What did that mask actually do for Khalar Zym anyway? It sure didn't help him fight any better or survive.  Ultimately a let down and Conan the Destroyer (for ALL of it's faults) still remains the closest to an actual Conan film (if seemingly based on a later Carpenter or Jordan novel) despite its campy tone.
B005SJIP2S|2.0|Thank god they are not playing Topographic Oceans! it will take them 3-4 hours to get to the 4th movement!  I loved \\"Fly from here\\" is a great album, but this? Nop. I cant' blame the new guy, the full band sounds just tired. A couple of songs sounds great (Tempus fugit, Machine messiah, both from Drama... coincidence?). The rest is awfully boring. And I don't think that Anderson returning will improve the situation, they are just old(no problem with that) and tired(that's the problem).
B006BQM762|4.0|My wife & I both quite enjoyed this movie.  If you're looking at an action/suspense movie like this for stellar acting & flawless plot, you deserve to be disappointed.  If you're looking for a good flick that entertains and is occasionally suspenseful, this is a great pick!  The movie elicited several laughs from both of us, and had us involved and interested the entire time.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I bought this to send music from my Sansa to my radio.  This is the third FM transmitter that I've owned, and it has by far the strongest signal with the least interference.  I live just south of Chicago, so there is plenty of possibility for interference!  My only quibble is that when I hook up my mp3 player to the Soundfly, it says something like \\"no device,\\" or \\"please insert device.\\"  So, I thought it wasn't working, until I tuned my radio to the frequency on the Soundfly, and there was my music.  It's not a complaint, it was just confusing for 5 minutes or so.  This is a great gadget, I couldn't be more pleased!

B004MOMT2M|5.0|What you might call \\"Hidden\\" albums can be found in all three Sector box sets AND in the \\"Moving Pictures\\" DVD-Audio disc. If you have a portable DVD-Audio player or have the ability to hear the \\"Surround\\" versions of the music only decoded in \\"Stereo\\" through your system you will discover fun and interesting versions of some of our favourite Rush albums. The Sector box sets are worth the price for these versions alone. Particularly interesting are: \\"By-Tor & The Snow Dog\\", \\"Xanadu\\", \\"Cygnus X-1\\" and \\"YYZ\\". Most fascinating of all are the versions of \\"Witch Hunt\\" (minus the crowd), \\"The Camera Eye\\" (incredibly clear dialogue!) and especially \\"Countdown\\", with ALL the NASA dialogue removed. The latter can be a strange and disconcerting experience but is unforgettable. If you are a musician or are just fascinated with hearing all the notes played or each drumskin hit and roll you won't be disappointed. Geddy's bass and Neil's drums are showcased distinctively in these versions. A welcome and invaluable addition to the best work in the RUSH catalog. I can only hope that when the rest of these Mercury albums are soon released as high resolution downloads they will also be released as physical DVD-Audio discs as well. Enjoy!

B005BCE7FQ|4.0|This video was reviewed very favorably in one of my A/V magazines.  5 stars for 3D.  5 stars for sound.

Good, clear surround sound.  Cute story...My lady LOVED it. I have to admit that I enjoyed it as well.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I've never been a big fan of Brad Pitt, but even I have to admit that he knocked it out of the park here on two levels: as the producer and driving force behind the film (even as it lingered in turnaround h-ll for years) and in his spot-on portrayal of Billy Beane.  I am, however, a long-time fan of Michael Lewis dating back to his debut with [[ASIN:039333869X Liar's Poker]].  [Heck, I even read 'Losers' in its little-remembered original incarnation as [[ASIN:0517286955 Trail Fever]].]  It says a lot that Lewis - skeptical as to how 'Moneyball' could ever be made into a film - has come out as a huge fan of the end product (I suspect - even though he took the money - that the same cannot be said of his view of the celluloid version of \\"The Blind Side\\").<br /><br />Lewis' hard-won approval says a lot about the combined talents of director Bennett Miller, screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, producer/star Pitt and an inspired cast, most notably Jonah Hill (an unlikely but relevatory pick as composite character, Peter Brand) and Phil Hoffman (who nails the dyspeptic Art Howe and his Venus and Mars relationship with Beane).  They distilled the essence of the story, delicately nailing the balance that Lewis achieves in the book: the juxtaposition of the deep-dive into the statistical arcania of Sabermetrics hard alongside rich character studies of the fascinating, complex Beane (Lewis knew he hit a goldmine there) and intriguing cases like Scott Hatteberg, a player whose career both defined and vindicated this new approach to baseball.  That juxtaposition is the Lewis oeuvre in a nutshell: it's the same feat he pulled off in \\"The Blind Side\\" (unlike \\"Moneyball,\\" that film's makers gave only the briefest glimpse to the economics behind the fascination with Michael Oher's playing potential)<br /><br />About the only headscratcher here: why Paul Depodesta (Bean's real-life Peter Brand) would pull his participation from the film.  The guy's out giving speeches trading on that relationship (he even uses Lewis' agency), so why he passed on getting himself represented directly in the film doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.ship (he even uses Lewis' agency), so why he passed on getting himself represented directly in the film doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.
B004EPYZSU|1.0|My low rating is not for the movie. The movie is ok. The plot is relatively novel and overall the movie is better than I was expecting given the title and trailers. Note: the aliens are likely too intense for young viewers.  My one star rating is for the \\"ultraviolet\\" option that apparently comes with this particular combo pack version of the movie. First of all, it was not clear (and still is not) from the Amazon advertisement that this was part of the blu-ray/dvd/digital copy combo pack. If it were clear and if I had known then what \\"ultraviolet\\" was, I would have thought twice about purchasing this combo set. I usually purchase the blu-ray/digital copy combo pack versions of new movies so that I can have a digital version for my mobile content viewers (phones, laptops, tablets etc). Ultraviolet is a \\"new\\" streaming option that is now being pushed and included by some of the studios in combo packs. The idea being that the ultraviolet digital version exists as part of \\"your\\" cloud account on the particular studio's server. This version can then supposedly be streamed to any of your devices at any time (if you have the right hardware and software). Merits and practicalities of streaming video content aside, because the studios are so intent on trying to establish this new format you cannot download the traditional digital copy that is included with the combo pack without FIRST signing up for an ultraviolet account on the studio's website. Yes, yet another group wants to know your demographic, to know your email address and to subject you to their spam. To add insult, once you have signed up for an ultraviolet account, you are only able to get your iTunes digital copy version via the net and not off of the combo pack dvd inserted into your computer as you normally would. What used to take 5 minutes to add to an iTunes library now takes 90! what a feature!   Even if one ignores the fact that this streaming model requires a studio-specific website account, the net value added of an \\"ultraviolet\\" option seems less than obvious. If you are at home you can already stream the entire contents of an iTunes library via AppleTV (or from a PC via similar hardware) and if you are not at home you would only be able to effectively stream from the studio's cloud if you had a good internet connection at your location. Considering that the memory capacities of mobile media players are growing rapidly and that most now come in versions that are able to hold much more than a day's worth of movies, why do we really need streaming at all? We probably don't. The studios, however, do benefit from this new format. It instantaneously it tells their marketing departments who is watching their content and when and how often. More importantly it provides them with a new format to sell and a new reason to raise prices. We already pay a premium for the higher quality of blu-ray and a premium for inclusion on the blu-ray release of a digital copy for our mobile devices. Streaming is not free. The studios have to maintain accounts and servers to support it. Personally \\"ultraviolet\\" streaming is not something I will ever use and thus I have no desire to support it or to pay for the premium that will surely be associated with it.   if you wish to push back on format creep and costs then do not purchase combo packs that include an ultraviolet version  Obviously it would be helpful if Amazon made it clear when these options are being included
B005HT400A|5.0|The Blu-Ray of Blue Velvet is a welcome contribution to cinephile experience.  And the film is still strking and brilliant, funny and scary.  Loved seeing it in HD.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|I went to the theater to see the first Fright Night.  I enjoyed it then.  But what this film has that the other film didn't is David Tennant (the magician) and Sandra Vergara (his assistant).  They really were top notch in their give and take in their scenes together and their characters really came alive on the screen.  I think if the story had been about the magician and David Tennant had been cast in the lead role, this film would have been a real box office hit.  If you don't rent or buy this film for any other reason, it should be to see these two in action.  Their performances were absolutely priceless.  I should also mention that Christopher Mintz-Passe was great as Charley Brewster's childhood friend, now shunned.  Special effects have come a long way since 1985 and Colin Farrell is chillingly scary right before--and after he mutates.  He positively oozes evil from his pores.    There were several drawbacks to this movie.  The casting of the high school students needed a bit of work--my older teenagers were laughing about how old a number of them looked--and that's not a good sign when you consider that this could have been their target audience. In addition, the script seemed a little sparse.  Otherwise, I would have rated this film higher.
B0068AWQQ2|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this film, I didn't realize a new version of this had been made until I saw it on Amazon. I took a chance last night and watched it - and I am happy I did. While I thought the car scene was poorly edited (which is why I only went 4 starts)I liked everything else and would watch it again. This movie is meant to be serious; it's supposed to be fun! Like the original (which is funny because I just caught it on TV the other night), the director understood that and didn't just make a cheesy re-make, the plot and names of the characters are essentially the same and the updates to the story worked really well. They also did a good job with the music; I am guessing the folks who worked on this film were fans of the original!!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is just what I needed to protect my new Kindle Fire.  Still light enough yet is a great case for protection.  Love the product.
B0054N73EY|1.0|It saddens me to write this but this album is very disappointing.  After following RHCP for years I looked forward to getting this.  If you are a RHCP fan I think the only reason you would want this album is if you are collecting all of the bands material.

B005EHNMWM|5.0|This is an amazing collection of songs from an extremely talented group of musicians. The songwriting is superb. Wilco outdoes themselves with this one. I think its Grammy bound. Buy it! Wilco fan or not, I honestly think you will be happy with this one.
B003LSTK8G|2.0|The book is interesting at times but very drawn out.  It would have been great magazine article.  Focusing on the winners of the financial crisis really cut the scope of the book and the economic downfall short.  Lewis does a great job of patting himself on the back throughout the book in discussing his long-held views of trading and his previous coverage of its corruption.  I wouldn't recommend the book at all.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Very simple to use. My 3 year old mastered it in a few minutes and he loves it. The stickers are fun and make it even better for young kids to use.

0446573019|5.0|Some of David Baldacci's books have been a little lacking in the last couple of years.  Not so with Zero Day - it is fast paced, exciting and puts the reader right in the middle of present day international intrigue.  One of those books I didn't want to put down until I finished it - well worth the time and money.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|As an older gamer living in an active home I found it impossible to hear the dialogue on my games during the rare occasions that I was able to enjoy them.  These headphones have brought the richness of the gaming environment back for me.  The surround sound not only allows me to clearly hear dialogue but footsteps and which direction they are coming from. More than once I have jumped from my chair as a wolf or other creature attacked my character.  Battery life is not that bad, but if you are a die hard gamer with hours on end to burn I would suggest rechargeable batteries, they take 2 AAA. The popping sound only becomes an issue if you walk out of the room with your headphones on.  I was actually able to still hear my game downstairs while my game was playing upstairs!  I highly recommend these headphones!

B0063GORYU|5.0|This version of spider solitaire is very easy to use. It is really a fun game to help you relax for a few minutes or fill in a few spare moments. You delly can't go wrong. Lots of fun.
1451629184|5.0|No, it is not the great American novel, which some here hold against the author. Then again, the author has a fifth grade education, so it is pretty impressive that she can write as well as she does.   I am happy that she made it out, that she has a family, that she is sane. None of us can begin to imagine what she went through, and if we did, would we have the courage to put it in a book? Dugard is an exceptional person. I hope she finds peace and happiness.
0876852630|4.0|While this book supplied some material for both Barfly and the movie of the same name, one of the things that makes it unique to me is how it expresses a WWII America where so many men had gone to war that one man ends up taking on all jobs.  Bukowski's style was at its best here, focused razor sharp.  He does take some wish fulfillment liberties but it's possible it's intended as jab at good ol' Henry Miller.  Lots of hilarious scenes, and a terse poignancy in the fate of an alienated wanderer.
B005I6EU48|5.0|So far I love my Kindle Fire cover. If looks great.   It was easy to attach to my Kindle and it is secure.  One of the best parts is that I can find it easily.    I loose my black one all of the time.[[ASIN:B005I6EU48 Verso Prologue Cover for Kindle Fire, Red]]

B001AGXEA6|3.0|I decided to buy this DVD after looking over the product pictures that other users posted and reading that this version of the movie has 3 of the Beetlejuice cartoons on it.  This DVD does NOT come with a bonus CD sampler as shown in the pictures. It also doesn't come with a slip cover as shown in the pictures either. The movie itself is very good with a nice clear picture and great sound. I have the original VHS but wanted this as well for the reason stated above.  If you plan on purchasing this item be aware the version you get might not be the one listed in the picture.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game, definitely worth buying. Will give you tons of hours of fun. Very clean, no bugs, execution great. Amazon kindle fire.
1569242739|5.0|There is a great diversity of recipes in here, and each one is just as good as the next. My favorite by far is the Pistachio Rosewater Cupcake. Rosewater is a little tricky to find, but you'll be able to find it at a Whole Foods if you're near one. A lot of these cupcakes taste good with or without the frosting, and personally I prefer without the frosting because frostings such as the buttercream is a bit too sugary for me, and the cupcakes are flavorful and perfect on their own. I definitely recommend this book for anyone who's interested in a vegan alternative to traditional baked goods. All the recipes are simple to make, ingredients are easy to find (except the rosewater), and if you're too lazy to pour them into little cupcake holders or don't have any in the house, just pour the batter into a cake pan. The chocolate cupcake mix is a great one to turn into a chocolate cake!

B002SRQ214|4.0|First amd 965 arrived quick and was well packed.  Either the board or the AMD cpu was DOA.  Amazon doesn't provide troubleshooting and only repair option is return.  Amazon shipped replacements that day.  Replacements arrived in a couple days, and although cpu was poorly packaged startup went smooth.  Two months later new system is fast, smooth, stable, awesome.  Only weak link is my internet connect speed.  I would definitely give five stars if first board/cpu hadn't been DOA.
0061980269|4.0|I read To Kill A Mockingbird years ago but was inspired to read it again after seeing the movie Capote (he was Harper Lee's best friend). What a progressive book for the time it was written...and so sincere and heartfelt. I'll be sure to get my kids to read it as soon as they're old enough. Amazon delivered this anniversary edition to me very quickly from the U.S. to Australia.

B00000ITOY|3.0|Twin boys enjoyed this toy but after some rigorous placing of shapes onto the pegs the pegs gave up and came out.  If your kids are somewhat aggressive about getting the shades onto the pegs you might want to sit with them to curb some of their enthusiasm and keep the pegs attached to the board.  Overall a fun toy that seems to engage children for numerous sessions.
B003AVPV1O|3.0|This does work to run two monitors, but if there are two VGA cords plugged in on one screen everything has a slight shadow making everything look blurry. Now when I use both monitors I plug the other in and after I am done using it I have to unplug the cord to make sure the other screen is not blurry.
B002ZG981E|1.0|Firstly, this movie kicked serious you-know-what. It was every bit as groundbreaking as The Matrix. That said, I'm giving it ONE STAR because Warner sux with their digital copy expirations. I too bought this today only to find out that despite nearly every other studio allowing digital copy redemption beyond expiration, Warner is playing the Grinch. To hell with you WB; good movie, raw deal- can't redeem the digital copy I PAID FOR! If you're going to give some BS about how you can't be responsible for retailers selling these movies with expired digital copies, then you need to be more accountable and have those copies PULLED from shelves!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Great game, but its not the full game.  You can't play any mini games, which is the best part.Believe that
B000I5XOVE|5.0|Same actors, plenty of action, amazing movie! If you don't know about these movies, and you like action movies, you need to watch all of them!
0375413405|3.0|I was so excited to get this cookbook after watching my favorite movie - \\"Julie and Julia\\", but the formatting of the book really detracts from my enjoyment.  The recipes run from one page to the next making flipping neccesary.  No color photos to inspire, only sketches.  The book may have been groundbreaking in 1961, but we have come a long way baby.  Perhaps I need to just get in there and try some of the recipes, but without pictures I don't find myself inspired.  Perhaps someone should re-visit this book and add photos and web based videos...
1594744769|5.0|This book was absolutely incredible! It left me dying for more. I got absolutely lost in Jacob's story and was completely absorbed by the characters, especially the peculiars. There better be a sequel; or else!
B005NF2UE6|1.0|I used to love this band. I couldn't get enough of their crunchy guitar riffs and live shows. Unfortunately, Nickelback lacks creativity when it comes to any new music. Then again, their formula can't be all that bad since they continue to sell millions of discs with each new release. I for one have bought my last Nickelback CD.  Right from the opening track I could sense that this CD was going to be difficult to enjoy. There are a few uptempo, heavier tracks but nothing worth hitting the repeat button on and if you have heard Chad sing about sex on previous songs then rest assured he still acts like a 17 year old in heat. All of the ballads sound the same...I mean exactly the same..BORING! The packaging does include song lyrics and a few photos.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is hands down the best app I have bought on amazon. Talk about the potential this app has. You have complete control of your desktop/laptop from your tablet to achieve anything a tablet is not able to do. Have to download a large file? Simply command your computer while at work to do it! Need to have documents emailed from home? No problem just emailed them to your self/cloud store them, anything really! I though the kindle fire would be limited because it is not the most powerful tablet in terms of hardware, that no longer matters because all your procesing is done on your desktop/laptop. Appearantly, some people do not like the display or resolution well just go to display settings for the computer itself to changed them to your preference.  I love the little things about the interface the app has such as two finger for scrolling, the windows start button, the F1,F2,F3... buttons. When I first used it I had to yell \\"I love the future!\\" by just how impress I was that my little tablet could do so much now.
0307593312|2.0|reading the first half of the book, i was waiting for it to get better.  reading the second half, i was waiting for it to end.   seriously, it becomes a chore.  the story, which is pretty weak, could have been told in a third, if not a quarter, of the length.   i never do this when reading, but at 800+ pages in, i'm starting to skim pages b/c 75% of the writing is filler.  i'm giving it two stars b/c i don't \\"hate it\\", as the one-star rating describes, but definitely a disappointment.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|If you liked the first installment of The Hangover, you should like Part II.<br />Part II ratchets up the amnesia, the debauchery and laughs.<br />Part II is still full of unexpected gags and sick comedy as was the original.<br />Certainly this flick does not deserve the one start given as I did not buy it<br />for the digital copy.

As I was reading about these heroic warriors fighting to the death I kept thinking I have no idea what I was doing on the day this was occurring.  I was in my safe part of this world living everyday life with no knowledge of the struggles going on so me and my family could live the life we do.    I think people just don't realize the sacrifices made everyday for our freedoms.  Please support and show respect for the men and women that allow us to have the freedom that others wish to take away.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I think I use this app more than I use the site!  I like the auction notifications, and the ease of use.<br /><br />The only things I would change are: 1) adding the ability to save sellers to our Favorite Sellers list, &amp; 2) keeping saved searches updated with new items only (it used to be a part of the app, but the last update seems to have a bug that cancels this option, even if checked). Otherwise, great app!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This alarm clock is simply the best. It has a simple to use interface, so easy my blonde teenager can use it! I really like the increasing volume function, it does not wake everyone else up, especially sine I wake up an hour earlier than everyone else.

B003VWU2WA|5.0|This controller is so versatile. It's perfect for Photoshop controls and quick commands. Griffin did a great job with the extensibility of the drivers for Mac. When I switch applications, the controls change based on what program I'm in. It really is more than just \\"a volume control\\".
0307408833|1.0|Like so many other reviewers have mentioned, the book itself is beautiful, but the recipes are \\"off\\". I truly cannot believe that these are the recipes used at the bakery. I bake quite a lot and have tried a number of the recipes in this cookbook and not one has been worth the time, or money, I spent to make it. I don't normally like to leave bad reviews, but why put out a book if you're not going to do it right? If you are looking for good gluten-free and vegan recipes, take a look at the Flying Apron's cookbook.
B000002GBJ|4.0|Good CD with lots of classical and rock crossovers. Totally instrumental, but with a large variety of moods and sounds.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app does remote desktop flawlessly over a local wireless network as well as over the Internet with its google  account login feature.  you can even watch videos as long as you don't mind a little lag. overall this app is definitely worth it.

0756405890|3.0|Well, the man can certainly write, I will give him that.  Although The Name Of The Wind was an easy read with interesting characters, unfortunately nothing really dramatic, confrontational, or evil happened to keep my interest.  And after reading a couple of reviews regarding the sequel I'm not sure I have the stamina to slug through another big book in which nothing exciting happens.
B005COO1X6|2.0|This was my first story trying out my Amazon Kindle Fire, and I was really excited about it.  It's also been a while since I picked up anything from King, so the anticipation was overflowing in all directions.<br /><br />You can't really beat the price of $2.99 I guess but I really expected more.  I am a huge fan of King's earlier short stories, but this story ended really abruptly and left me pretty disappointed.<br /><br />The story is about a mysterious \\"car\\" at a backwater rest stop and some random people that come into contact with it.  The characters were interesting as usual, but don't expect any kind of explanation or unraveling of details, because it just doesn't happen.  This story talks about one afternoon in the life of a weird \\"car\\", and will literally leave your forehead crinkled in confusion at the end.  Any true Kind fan would expect more, even in a short story.<br /><br />Kind of disappointed by King here, but on the plus side, the new Kindle Fire is awesome.
B000001ZS4|5.0|Back in the seventies. Incredible in 1978, sound like Future.   One of the best electronic recordings of all time. Highly recommended.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Know your weather details when you need it.  All this at the tip of your fingers. Know how hot how wet if itvwill snow.
B006INDMEE|5.0|This film brings plenty of action, drama, and suspense for everyone's taste.  As expected, Helen Mirren delivers her talent flawlessly.    The subject of their pursuit is a reflection of a disturbing reality -- I don't know that the actual story itself is true, but there have been stories like this in real life.  Nazi war criminals hiding... thinking they've got it made, but eventually they get caught.  The screenplay was well composed; highly recommended!
1597801585|4.0|Its very Gibson - lots of ideas thrown into a blender with a well-paced narrative.  The story opens quickly, advances throughout, and provides a good backstory on the main characters who interact to move the plot along. Some pieces are hard to piece together until the end, and some of the wrap-ups seem unsatisfying - how like real life.  But the concepts - Cheshires and Wind-Ups, a calorie based-post oil economy, and the Thailand setting make for a very interesting ride.  Enjoy!
B003ODL004|5.0|I love this sound track. My favorites are \\"Half remembered Dream\\" and \\"Dream is collapsing\\". I would recommend this to anyone.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was a bit wary of getting a cover for my Fire at first because I didn't want something bulky and ugly. I'm happy to say that this cover is neither. It has a sleek design that looks great and the cover is light and thin while still feeling pretty substantial in terms of protection. The cover also allows you to prop the Fire up, which has been great for watching videos on my nightstand or setting it up on the table and playing music from Pandora. I would definitely recommend this.
B000W7JWUA|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1P3LITN348LI3]]Ok so I think this game is amazing wonderful in so many ways and a blast to play with friends.  It challenges you in so many ways and is a really creative way to get together with friends.  Now I could go on and on about the game but my main problem with it is the cardboard pieces.  The tiles themselves have already started to bend and warp and I have barely used the set.  I bought this game in November and have played it about twice a month.  Now my tiles have a difficult time fitting correctly and always act strangely.  I'm really upset because the game is awesome, but these tiles are just atrocious. I have no idea if it is the humidity in my area, or the fact that the board is always disassembled and reassembled but ten less than ten uses and already warping is not acceptable in  my opinion.  Two stars off and I shall be uploading a video to demonstrate and contacting Amazon about a refund.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|To me, this album is full of very rich, subtle, adult feelings that the artist visits upon us as snow falls quietly, somewhat hauntingly. This album is mature, reflective and melancholy. She is languid, taking her time to construct moods and feelings that creep into you. I'm glad she takes her time. She is telling stories that seem to be tied together by a theme of longing. It's a very relaxing, peaceful, somewhat dark, somewhat erotic cd. It was a little hard to digest at first, but after a few listens, I began to really like it. She is very intelligent. I'm glad I bought this.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|This movie had so much potential but absolutely fell short. The trailer was so misleading but I suppose that is because there was no plot to this film. Honestly this movie seemed more like a bad dream that I wanted to wake up from. Overall it really lacked in all areas from start to finish.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is a very versatile, clean, and practical cover for the Kindle Fire. The Kindle Fire snaps right into place, and I have no worries of it falling out. In addition the cover folds into three pieces so you can use to stand up the Kindle Fire while watching movies. The elastic band is also very useful in keeping the cover closed.<br /><br />The only negative that I see is the felt on the interior side of the cover leaves a very small line on the screen of the Kindle Fire where the fold is. That's the only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.
B0064SHI9I|3.0|I bought this for various reasons, one for the remote wipe which I hope I never have to use the other to back up my messages online. I was disappointed to find out the services only offer 100 mb of data online and i would have to purchase more to save more messages. I however feel that the services other than that will be worth my while should something happen.
B004IFYMWK|4.0|This movie portrays an important chapter in America's history. It is sad to say that some people in power will do anything to increase their power. They believe that the ends justify the means. It appears they got at least two people killed.  The movie generates suspense and tension as it lays out the story of Valerie Plame and Joe Wilson. Valerie and Joe each have to make separate decisions about whether they should play it safe by keeping quiet or should expose lies perpetrated by some at the head of the American government.  While it is not a five star movie, it certainly is more than a one star movie. Most of those giving it one star are hoping you skip this sad but important lesson in how America got into the second war in Iraq.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I read a lot of reviews that state they didn't understand why Emily wanted to commit suicide, that it wasn't explained very well, and that Emily's character wasn't well developed. I was nervous reading it, because nothing irritates me more than when I don't get answers, or some kind of closure.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I couldn't help but wonder, if we were reading the same book? The love story is beautiful and heart breaking, and it was very clear to me from the beginning, why Emily would want end her life, the pain, the confusion... the book is definitely a tragedy, that pulls at your own heart strings, my heart broke for both Chris and Emily.<br /><br />This is the first book I've read by Jodi Picoult, and I will definitely be reading more. I think I've found a new author to obsess over. This book really surpassed my expectations. I love her writing style, and her ability to suck me into a story so much that I become invested in the characters, and the outcome.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is perfect cover for the Kindle Fire. It is lightweight and easy to use. Best of all it does not impede the use of the Kindle Fire screen.
034552554X|5.0|This is a beautifully written story.  I loved how the author used the meanings of the flowers throughout--making the characters speak in code.  This book is a work of art.  I enjoyed every word.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Since his first appearence in Detective Comics #27 in May 1939, the Batman has appeared in countless comics, live action and animated T.V shows, feature films, toys, and video games. The Batman has become a fixture of modern pop culture to such a degree that even those individuals that have never read an issue of the comic book know the story of how as a child Bruce Wayne witnessed the death of his parents, an event the inspired him to use his family fortune to become a vigilante as an adult.    After four feature films from Directors Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher from 1989 to 1997, that ran from the darkly gothic to the flamboyantly ridiculous, studio Warner Brothers decided to reboot the franchise with a film grounded in reality. Director Christoper Nolan's 2005 film Batman Begins explores how the childhood trama that Bruce Wayne suffers drives his obsession to fight fear and injustice. The film begins with Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) locked away in a prison in South Asia.  Through flashbacks we see the death of Wayne's parents and his resulting desire to learn about the criminal underworld so that he may learn to fight it.  Lost on his quest, Wayne is recruited by Henri Ducard (played by Liam Neeson), a member of the League of Shadows - an organization who seeks to fight injustice.  Ducard becomes a mentor to Wayne and provides the inspiration for Wayne to return to his home town of Gotham City (a fictional protrayal of New York) and become the Batman.  Wayne uses the resources of his family company, Wayne Enterprises, to secure his suit, gadgets, and Batmobile that he is known for.  The film strives to be as realistic as possible with the development of the Batman's tools.  It's nearly an hour into the film before we even get to see Wayne as Batman, but the journey to that point is so interesting that it feels extremely rewarding when we get to it.  There is a slew of characters, all protrayed excellently by a great cast.  Other than Bale and Neeson,Wayne's Butler and childhood guardian Alfred is played perfectly by Michael Caine. Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox - an executive at Wayne Enterprises that assists Wayne with his gadgets. Gary Oldman is superb as Sgt. James Gordon, seemingly the only honest cop in a truely corrupt city. Cillian Murphy is Jonathan Crane, the Scarcrow, a psychopharmacologist who works at Arkham Asylum and is working with Crime Boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) to bring fear-inducing toxins into Gotham. Actress Katie Holmes is Wayne's childhood friend/love interest and Gotham City assistant district attorney.  The sound and video presentation on this Blu-Ray are excellent given that this release is several years old now. The menus look outdated, but there is a good quantity of special features on this disc.  In addition to a picture in picture commentary track, there are several short featurettes ranging from 10 to 15 mins showing the various elements of the making of the film.  Also, there is a short preview for the film's sequel, The Dark Knight.  Overall, Batman Begins is a insightful look at the motivations of one of comic book's most interesting characters. At the time of the release of this film, I felt it was the best movie based on a comic book that I had seen. So far I believe only it's sequel, The Dark Knight, has surpassed it in terms of quality. It's relatively easy to find it for less than $10, so I recommend a buy price at $10 or less.  At the time of the writing of this review the film is also available on Amazon Video on Demand for $4.99.

0385504209|4.0|There seems to be an awful lot of hostility towards Dan Brown and his books, mainly by professional or amateur historians who are upset that he claims certain background elements of his books are accurate when they probably aren't.  I would just like to remind these people that this book is found in the \\"Fiction\\" section for a reason, and that the majority of people reading it are doing so to be entertained, not to learn religious history.<br /><br />If you are looking to be entertained, this book does the job nicely.  It's a fast-paced, keep you guessing, edge or your seat, page-turner, or whatever other synonym you'd like to use.  The chapters are kept very short and nearly every one ends on some type of cliffhanger.  I'm not a *huge* fan of this style of writing; I believe it creates a sort of false sense of drama (particularly when the author deliberately withholds information from the reader that the characters themselves already know), but you can't say that it's not effective.  As annoyed as I got at times, the book was still very fun to read, and the story is very compelling.  It didn't sell millions of copies for nothing, you know?<br /><br />If you're looking to study religious history, this book is probably not for you.  But you probably already knew that, so why would you even bother?
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Hey Crosby & Goulet, get out of my cd changer and make room for the new classic in my collection. Anyone familiar with Ian Anderson/Jethro Tull know there is no other band like them nor has there ever been. This collection of songs includes remade classics, fresh Christmas songs I've never heard, and some winter-themed classics. I finally can hear my wife play something besides the Kenny/Dolly Christmas.  She (like myself) is totally addicted to Tull Christmas.

B002SAUCBC|5.0|I have read this short story over and over again! Whenever I find out a friend has never read Stephen King I always tell them to check out this story to get a taste of what he has to offer. So far they have all become big fans of his books.
B005J29HD0|5.0|There's no telling what music fans in '68 would have thought if SMiLE had come out as planned.  I think it would have easily rivaled 'Sgt Pepper' in terms of impact, although 'Pepper' was more 'of the times'.  SMiLE is definitely a more adventurous, stylistically diverse record, and also more fun.  Brian Wilson' head was definitely in the clouds, but the music is as playful as it is pshycedelic.  Since I got this (vinyl) record, I can't stop listening to it, and the melodies have been swimming around in my head for days, and I find myslef humming many of them.  Songs like 'Cabin Essence' and 'Surfs Up', 'Wonderful' are the absolute pinnacle of Brian Wilson's songwriting genius.  There was no one else around who could match this timeless beauty before or since.    Music aside, the production is absolutely staggering, given it was recorded in the 1967.  I have a modest system, but I took SMiLE over to a friend who has a very high end setup.  Not even being that big of a Beach Boys fan, even he was floored by the depth and genius of the production, and  we were both transfixed by what we were hearing.  Indeed SMiLE is Brian Wilson gift to the world, a work of unrivaled dedication , devotion, and love.  This music lives up (if not surpasses) the weighty legend that has existed around it since 1967.  The quality of the vinyl discs also lives up to expectations.  It would been a real travesty if they hadn't.  My pressing is flawless, dead quiet and dynamic, basically everything you can ask   when purchasing new vinyl.  I can't say enough about how wonderful SMiLE is.  We are very lucky that Brian and the Beach Boys were able to finally give the album to us 44 years later.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Matilda is my husband's favorite DVD.  It seems strange that a man should love a movie like this but he has a very strong sense of right and wrong and good and evil. This movie, in all its innocence, embodies all that is right in the world and is very uplifting.  It is funny, clever, relaxing and entertaining to watch but one still gets a life lesson out of it. Everything we see doesn't have to have foul language or violence for violence sake in it.  That aspect of the entertainment industry is getting a little \\"old\\".  Therefore, a movie like Matilda is a refreshing change.

0316066524|1.0|Do you remember that prank you used to play on an unsuspecting victim?  Everyone would be in on it except for one poor soul.  One person tells a joke with a nonsensical punchline.  Everyone except the mark knows to laugh at when the punchline is said.  If the mark laughs everyone gives him a hard time for not thinking for himself - he only laughed because everyone else laughed. Loser!<br /><br />This book is in the same spirit.  A group of literary elites have deviously agreed among themselves that this piece of sh_t book is actually good.  Then they sit back and laugh when other people not in on the joke actually claim the book is a worthwhile read.  Most people read it (or begin reading it) and are not so easily influenced by \\"elite\\" opinion, conclude it is garbage and put it down. A few people read it and think they like it - they have succumbed to nerdy literary peer pressure.  Don't be the mark - the book is terrible.  If you read it and like it you are like the 10 year old by that laughed at the punchline \\"pink elephant, pink elephant!\\" without really understanding why.

0446693804|5.0|I read this book right before the movie came out. The book is definitely much better than the movie, although I do love the movie. One of the best books I've ever read. And by far my favorite author.
B004HEXSLI|4.0|I had seen Jill Bolte Taylor's video on TED and was charmed and the book goes into greater depth. The first chapter has a lot of info on the actual workings of the brain but is largely understandable and the rest of the book reads like a novel; a wonderfully uplifting story and full of insights that we all can use, whether we have had strokes ourselves or are caring for those that have. It also reads well for those who are adapting to the natural changes age brings to our mates and ourselves. The author obviously had a life changing experience akin to an religious awakening or a psychedelic drug experience...valuable lessons about recognizing our individual oneness with the universe.  Altho she is a scientist this is not a scientific book, it is written from her newly accessed, creative right side of her brain, not her critical left.

B004LROUW2|4.0|I first heard of this book back in the Summer of 2011. As soon as I read the plot I was hooked and immediately added it to my Amazon Wish List. It was definitely worth the wait. IMHO this is one of The top three books of 2011. There are so many plots and sub plots that my comments would run for paragraphs and paragraphs. All I will say is that the story is compelling and draws you in almost from the start. The characters are very well defined and the reader gets the sense that one is actually viewing each through their own private telescope.<br /><br />Like a fine wine, the story has a long finish and stays with you long after you stop reading. To me, the sign of a good story is the excitement in wanting to get back to reading it as soon as you can. The story will be with you long after you close the cover or turn off your Kindle.
1451627289|5.0|Hand's down one of the best books I have ever read.  I had read some Stephen King many years ago (Christine, Pet Semetery, Thinner) and while those were all good books, I never fully embraced his genre or niche.  So, being a little skeptical of Stephen King, but an avid reader of history, I picked this up and couldn't set it down until I was done and was sad it was over.  Although it is based on a watershed historical event, one does not need to be into the historical genre to appreciate this book.  I could visualize the characters and their environment every step of the way through the story telling and character development.  I could drone on and on about this book... but won't.  Just do yourself a favor and read it!
B005NPLXJ4|3.0|I have no idea why I like this album. Not every song is good, that's a given. I think it kinda drops off near  the end. When I sampled this album on the website before the release date, I hated it. I think \\"Iced Honey\\" and \\"The View\\" are actually good songs and there's excellent song arranging on almost all the songs. That's Metallica for you. Expecting this to sound like Metallica will disappoint you but there are some riffs that sound like they coud have been on the Load and Reload albums. I know almost everyone else dogs this album and I can't fault them for it but you should give it a listen if you're curious.

B0030ZOYJ0|1.0|I will start of by saying I did watch the orginal series.  I have seen this over and over again I was attempting to figure out what the hype was all about and Well in my Opnion (IMO) They should not have \\"Remade\\" This series.  The orginal you have to take alot in it had some great action and awesome grapgics for its time, The orginal story jumped around alot and it seemed that the ending was done to quickly, the orginal did not take \\"IMO\\" enough time to explain the main Charaters and made them either realy Winny, Exstreamly tempermental or Emotionaly blank...The orginal I would of given 3 perhaps 4 stars b/c even with some of the flaws you still had a awesome Scf-fi anime but in all that was the Orginal series.  However this is a remake of the orginal series and I do see that they cut alot out to add some eye candy to this generation of Anime viewers. Personaly I think they did a poor job of it and should not of messed with something that had flaws to begin with.  But on a side note it's still a Sci-fi anime with loads of action but b/c of the cuts and the trimming they made I do think they made it much much worse.

B004LWZW9C|1.0|\\"New Year's Eve\\" is the latest release from Director Gary Marshall and writer Katherine Fugate, who also wrote the previously released \\"Valentine's Day\\". She seems to have a holiday theme going on here. Although she may have to come up with a new gimmick because this one may have seen its day. Marshall has had his share of smash hits in his long career, like \\"The Princess Diaries\\" films, \\"Runaway Bride\\" and the big one, \\"Pretty Woman\\".  Compared to \\"Pretty Woman\\", \\"New Year's Eve\\" is an about to be cancelled sitcom.<br /><br />\\"New Year's Eve\\" takes on eight different stories in the lives of New Yorkers preparing for the 2012 Times Square ball drop. The stories may or may not intertwine. One thing to note about the movie is that they had no problem getting a treasure of recognizable to Oscar winning or deserving actors. For instance, Hilary Swank, Oscar winner twice, plays the ball drop organizer. Halle Berry, another Oscar winner, plays a nurse overlooking a dieing patient played by Robert DeNiro who's won two Oscars himself and probably should have won more. Michelle Pfeiffer, nominated three times for Oscar, plays a timid lady who wants to learn how to live, all in one night.<br /><br />Despite the presence of these fantastic actors, much of the acting and scenes appear to be unprepared or rushed. It was as if they all got their scripts and two days later, filmed it.  Although to be fair, the storylines that involved Swank, Berry and DeNiro were the ones that hit home with me the most.<br /><br />There are poignant moments in \\"New Year's Eve\\". There were even a few moments where I was even touched. Some of the elements that a movie about New Year's Eve should have were done well. Say goodbye. Say hello. Live better. Give more. Learn from mistakes. Spend time with loved ones. Although as a comedy, the movie fails badly. The funniest moments of the film were at the conclusion of the movie when they aired a blooper reel during the closing credits.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of these type movies where they are telling multiple stories and bouncing back and forth. You don't get a true feeling of relation to the characters and it's hard to get into a flow with a story when it's changing every five minutes. Although Robert DeNiro proves that a great actor can hook you in a matter of seconds. Unfortunately, he's one actor and one story in a movie full of dozens of actors and multiple stories.<br /><br />\\"New Year's Eve\\" does take you right smack dab in the middle of a night in New York City during the ball drop ceremony, which is a cool thing if you've never been, but it has a thrown together feel and it cheapens the movie. The final twenty minutes of the movie were fun, but the movie as a whole was unpolished and disappointing.ey are telling multiple stories and bouncing back and forth.

B006DHAT5K|1.0|\\"What's Your Number?\\" is an R-rated romantic comedy that stars Anna Faris, who is known for being quirky characters, most notably for her role in the movie \\"House Bunny\\". Her counterpart in the movie is Chris Evans from \\"Captain America\\". The premise centers around Ally Darling (Faris), who, after being fired from her job, stumbles across an article in a Marie Claire magazine that says the average amount of sexual partners you should have in your lifetime is around 10. Ally's number is considerably higher than that. So, she assumes she has already met the person she was supposed to marry and starts on a quest to find out which one of the men she had been with and should have stuck with.<br /><br />As far as romantic comedies go, it's not a bad premise, but the problem is, \\"What's Your Number?\\" tries way too hard to be funny and poignant and fails at both. I won't deny that some of the humor in the movie made me laugh. For the most part though, the comedic attempts were way over the top and seemed to fall flat like a lump of coal.<br /><br />For instance, as she waits for one of her men to cross the restaurant, we get a slow motion moment where he greets everybody in the place like he's a rock star or Mr. Popularity and Ally's hair catches on fire from a barbecue pit behind her. There are numerous moments like this. She falls over a fence and says a bad word and of course there are children nearby who begin to chant the dirty word over and over.<br /><br />One message the movie has that resonated with me was its message about love and how you can tell for yourself what love is. Unfortunately, it was the only thing in the movie that grabbed me. It was too long, clich&eacute; and poorly written from beginning to end.<br /><br />Many of the scenes in the movie also seemed to be staged just to highlight a different spot in the city of Boston. I'm pretty sure that the city of Boston paid a pretty penny for this movie and because of that had a lot of say in what, where and when scenes would be shot, all the way up to the final shot of the film. Of course the break-in strip basketball scene at Boston's Bank North Garden basketball court was solid proof of that.<br /><br />\\"What's Your Number?\\" is not a very good movie. It's desperate flailing for laughs and moments is evidence enough they knew they had a lot of work to do in order to overcome a lackluster script.the final shot of the film.

B004PKM5XG|5.0|Unless you have a non-stabilized system or a very heavy lens, a monopod is not necessary and not worth the trouble.  One problem is that a monopod does not stabilize the lens from left to right.  This is a good monopod for the price.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Used this device for my 37\\" LG TV to connect Polk Audio Soundbar. TV only had optical digital sound output and Soundbar only had RCA analog connector as input. Device works for this arrangement. I did talk (emailed) LG and asked about their output sound setting as my menu didn't have an option for setting it. LG informed me all their TV's use PCM format. I did set my Dish Network Receiver Audio Output to PCM Only. With this setting I have had No Issues so far with not getting the soundbar to work on movies which are showing in 5.1 format.

B0007WF1WI|4.0|I guess I didn't read all the features of the disc, or it's probably because I'm not too familiar with Dual Disc. The problem is that I tried to rip the CD to my iTunes on my Macbook Pro, and my MBP did not read the CD side of the disc. Maybe it's the MBP, not sure if anyone other computers have this problem. I wish I would have known ahead, I would have stuck to the regular CD, I don't really need the other features anyways.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|The instructions to the tool are good and the tool assembled easily.  If it has a drawback, it is in the operator.  Every bottle is different in thickness and chemistry. I found that a firm pressure and a steady grip make the tool work like a charm. The secret is in turning the bottle in a steady motion. The 'tap' tool is the least usable part leading to more failures than just mere patience. If you're going to cut bottles, this is the tool. Just be safe. The glass is some bottles, especially beer bottles, is under stress and explode when cut. Safety first.
B005SV9X22|2.0|Let me just tell you what it was that I did not like about this concert, she talked too much. It seemed that she had a long story almost after every song she performed. The costumes were ridiculous, what else can we expect from her. But some of the performances I must admit were fun to watch. I would have enjoyed this DVD if it wasn't for those long speeches she gave, some that had no relevance to the show. I get that fans that look up to her might enjoy hearing that stuff, but I just have to say that not everyone is interested in hearing a whole book on her adventures in Madison Square Garden. The only speech I remember, and did not mind was her sharing how she used to visit the arena and now is performing in it. The rest of it, I completely forgot and should have probably just fast forwarded through it.

B005TQAI6G|5.0|Great tour, I got to see it live in Los Angeles and had a blast. The DVD is great, I had a good time re-watching the show of course this time from my TV.

B0000009NH|5.0|David Bowie / Hunky Dory (The RYKO 15 track CD):  This is an excellent album from Bowie and the four extra tracks on the RYKO version adds to its excellence.  This is a Five Star album.
B00008A7QK|4.0|T. Rex / Electric Warrior (the expanded 18 track version): Marc Bolan had a very unique sound and that sound served him well.  This album has the huge \\"Bang a Gong\\" hit as well as \\"Jeepster\\" but overall, the album is good, not great.  The many bonus tracks are welcome but they are not enough to raise its standing.  The 20 minute interview added to the end just forces you to get up and change the CD.  Four Stars.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|The Concert For Bangladesh (2 disk DVD):  This is the first big charity Rock N Roll concerts ever given, it is also a Great concert, and a portion of the money from the sale of this set still goes to the charity that continues to save lives.  The purchase of this set is a Win, Win, Win proposition.  The DVD set gets 5 stars and deserves a 6th.
B00005Y46O|4.0|FREE / Live! (The expanded 15 track Island Remasters CD):  The flaw of the original album was its length.  That problem is solved with this version of the CD.  Although there is some repetition in the bonus tracks, they are still welcome.  Sometimes rockin, sometimes soulful, this is a fine presentation of FREE at their live best.  With good live versions of \\"All Right Now\\", \\"Fire and Water\\", and other FREE hits, this album is a good alternative to some of the studio albums.  I don't think this is the `greatest live album ever', but it is a very good one and very enjoyable.  Four Stars.
B00007FOMP|5.0|Marvin Gaye / What's Going On:<br /><br />Marvin nearly drove the leadership of Motown crazy then he presented this album to them.  Marvin was a romantic soul singer, not a revolutionary (in Motown's eyes anyway).  Motown did not want to release this album because it went against their polity of keeping out of politics and keeping the music `happy'.  However, Berry Gordy Jr. (the head of Motown) knew that he had a Masterpiece on his hands; he just didn't know how the fans would react to it.  This was, after all, 1971, the Vietnam War was raging, the nation was just waking up to the environmental problems we had created, and the post MLK civil rights movement was floundering at the time.  Marvin managed to tackle all those subjects beautifully in his admittedly short album.  The release of this album sent shockwaves through the recording business, and sent several songs onto the airwaves.  However, Marvin's Masterpiece was not created in a void.  A year before, Donny Hathaway had released his \\"Everything Is Everything\\" album and its influence on Marvin's album is obvious, to the extent that \\"What's Going On\\" has several direct references to Hathaway's album.<br /><br />\\"What's Going On\\" is nothing less than the greatest album ever released.<br /><br />My suggestion is, when you buy this album, you ought to buy Donny Hathaway's \\"Everything Is Everything\\" album as well.  Play Hathaway's album first, then play \\"What's Going On\\".  This is an extraordinary `one-two' audio punch.<br /><br />As to the various versions of \\"What's Going On\\":  As long as you have the original album, and the bonus tracks haven't become a distraction to that album, it doesn't matter which CD version you get.<br /><br />In a Five Star rating system, \\"What's Going On\\" rates a 10.
B0000033OT|5.0|Donny Hathaway / Everything is Everything (bonus track edition):  This is a brilliant album that spoke to the American experience of the late 1960's, yet it has kept relevant to this day.  \\"To be young, gifted, and black\\" certainly speaks of the `black experience' but even it's message applies to everyone facing obstacles.  This album was clearly an inspiration to Marvin Gaye when Marvin created his perfect \\"What's Going On\\" album, in fact, to really enjoy Marvin's album to the fullest, this CD by Donny Hathaway ought to be played before it.  This is a solid Five Star album.
B003Y8YXFS|4.0|John Lennon / Imagine:  The album begins with its high point, the beautifully performed \\"Imagine\\".  Everyone has his or her own opinion and interpretation of the song, my attitude towards it changes with my mood, but it is a great song regardless of my mood.  One thing is sure however, and that is that the title track is a very different song than the rest of the album.  \\"Jealous guy\\", \\"Oh my love\\" and \\"Oh yoko!\\" are all good love songs, or even `fear of love' songs.  With these songs, he at least uses some of the poetic language that made so many of his songs so universal in scope.  However, the track \\"Crippled Inside\\" could be a good way to describe the rest of the album.  It is also an indication that this album is not going to be a musical adventure but a physiological enema set to music.  In many ways, this album is the bravest ever made, as it seems that every feeling John has had over the past months since the breakup of the Beatles is being shared with us in as raw and direct a way as possible.  This is both the strength and weakness of the rest of the album.  It has strength in directness but weak in the poetic language that made the title track so appealing. The rest of the album is painful.  By that, I do not mean it is bad, what I mean is that the rest of the songs are full of Pain, irrational crippling Pain.  The most painful of them is, of course, \\"How do you sleep?\\" with its direct, merciless, attack on his old bandmate.  Such an attack may have brought some satisfaction to Lennon, but it makes his listeners question just how dedicated he himself was to \\"joining us... and the world will be as one\\".  Yet even this is part of this emotional unveiling, as he is not even afraid to let us see his own inner contradictions.  This would probably have been a better album if he had made it more of a set of songs and less a set of diary pages, but for all the risks he takes on this album, it at least deserves four stars.  In short, I like the album, but I don't love it.love it.

0060751967|5.0|The Love at Stake series is wonderfully addictive! I've listened to about 6 of the books in audio format so far, & they are all fabulous! The narrators are a little different for each one, providing their own unique style of wit and humor.  This first book, How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire, starts with the usual vampire rules but then adds some amazing changes & perks. The creativeness and humor just keep getting better and better with each book I've read. Usually I get tired of a series after a few books -- not the case with this one. Thank you Kerrelyn Sparks! You're an incredible author!

B000005RPX|5.0|Deep Purple / Live In Japan August 1972 (3 concerts on 3 CDs):  For the Super Fan of Deep Purple, or the Super Fan of the \\"Made In Japan\\" album, this is the perfect Fat Boy 3 CD set.  The casual fan should stick to the original \\"Made In Japan\\" CD.  Now we can understand why the record company had to combine the studio version of `Smoke on the water' with the live version for the \\"Made In Japan\\" release.  Deep purple only plays `Smoke...' twice, and the band was already so tired of the opening riff that they purposely mess it up on both performances.  It's actually quite funny to hear it, and it doesn't even ruin the song, but it certainly would not have become the Mega-Hit it was without the `fix'.  All three concerts are enjoyable, unavoidably repetitious, but well done throughout.  The Super Fan will give it 5 Stars.  The casual fan will also give it 5 stars...but would not want to listen to all three concerts in succession (although, I have no idea why a 'casual fan' would want this anyway).
030726999X|5.0|I have just completed the remarkable Stieg Larsson trilogy about Lisbeth Salander.  I love Larsson's ability to tell a complex story and to sustain the level of intensity and interest throughout all three tomes.  I wish we could look forward to more treats from his mind and his pen.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" ratchets up the level of intensity and intrigue from the high mark that had been set by the first two volumes in this series.  This book stands on its own, with enough hints at what has gone before to allow the new reader to make sense of the relationships among characters and plot twists.  But the real delight is for the reader who has traversed each page of this three-volume masterpiece and arrives at the mountaintop to take in the literary panorama laid out before him/her.<br /><br />This story is a rare action thriller that moved me to tears.  Lisbeth Salander is the most unlikely literary heroine - brilliant, withdrawn, mostly silent and sullen, and intensely set on dispensing vigilante justice to those who have taken advantage of the helpless.  Having been victimized repeatedly by men and institutions, she rises above her victim status to avenge those less able to fight back.  Along the way, she has learned to distrust everyone.  Part of the deeply moving denouement of this epic saga is her conscious decision to take the enormous risk of trusting again, beginning with her longtime acquaintance and former lover, Mikael Blomkvist and his attorney sister.<br /><br />The English language versions of the films of this story are being made and released.  They cannot begin to capture all of the nuance of the books from which they have been spawned.  Give yourself a treat, and sink into a comfortable chair and be transported to the world of Salander, Blomkvist and their adventures.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin / Zoso, 4, etc:  Whatever the name of this album is, it's a Masterpiece.  If you don't have it, you ought to get it.  If you hate it, you are sure to love the music of Myron Floren (whose music is found elsewhere).

B000002KDO|5.0|Black Sabbath / Master of Reality:  The riffs on this album are the best that Black Sabbath ever produced, like addictive music candy.  The songs are black and white, good vs evil, hope vs despair, and every one of them is excellently performed.  This is the band at their best musically and lyrically.  Unfortunately, they would not continue in this direction for very long and would eventually become comic version of themselves, but at least we have this album to show us how good they were at their best.  Five Stars

If you don't have it, you ought to get it.  Which Version is the best? - I have no idea, there are too many to keep track of.  My advice is to buy a CD with the original 18 songs and ignore the `bonus barrage'.  Turn it up!

B000056KTG|4.0|Iggy Pop & The Stooges / Raw Power (NEON release - 2000):  The NEON version of Raw Power is NOT the official album.  This is a collection of various \\"...rehearsing in the studio, in private, away from the media...\\" tracks.  Some of these were recorded before the official album was released, some were recorded after the official album release.  This CD does not even have the same songs as the official album, so be aware of what you are getting before you get the \\"NEON Netherlands Import\\" release.  The fact that this CD does not have the traditional cover picture should tell you that this ain't the official CD (click on link below to see this NEON cover).  Now, with all that being said (and I think I made my point), this is a good CD.  The performances are very good and I'd rather listen to this than the actual `raw power' album.  However, Amazon does not provide audio samples for this CD, so your buying a `pig in a poke' if you get this CD.  You may love it or hate it but you probably won't know until after you buy it.  Four Stars.[[ASIN:B000056KTG Raw Power]]
B003BZXHS8|5.0|More than any other movie I have seen, the Director's Cut of KoH creates a very different film.   Ordinary Director's Cuts add a couple of minor scenes that were edited (usually wisely) from the theatre release Not so with Kingdom of Heaven!  Ridley Scott shot an epic masterpiece that was cut to ribbons -- slashing some 50 minutes , down to 2 hours 24 minutes - to avoid the \\"Intermission Curse\\" of films too long to show multiple times daily at the nearby multi-plex.   Perhaps that is why the release disappointed at the box office, despite its untouched epic battle scenes.  That film was a surprisingly accurate portrayal of events leading to the reconquest of Jerusalem by Islamic forces in 1187, which triggered the Second Crusade. It was a time of extraordinary events and persons -- all excellently cast. But none of the characters grew past a shadowy figure with some lines between the battles. Even basic questions in the narrative were left without answers.  Awkwardly forced into the center of the roiling clash of visions and egos was central character Balian (Orlando Bloom), the bastard son of the Baron of Ibilin (Liam Neeson).      The Director's Cut reinserts 50 minutes of narrative and character exploration! (Yes, there is an Intermission - featuring the eerily appropriate musical score of Harry Gregson-Williams.) The characters explode into complexity, lifting the plot onto a level with the battle scenes. Of special note is a greater understanding of Neeson's character, and the exploration of Balian's crisis of faith -- along with a surprising counterpoint from another character whose most significant aspect was eliminated from the original release.   Restored material also answers all narrative and sequential questions, especially by restoring significant material preceding Balian's departure for the Holy Land with his father.   This is the masterpiece envisioned by Scott!  It is deeper with grander sweep even than \\"Gladiator.\\"  Please invest the time to see this \\"new\\" movie!!!
B000002OX7|5.0|The Who / Who's next (1995, 16 track edition):  This is a GREAT album.  Would the \\"Lifehouse\\" project been better if they had finished it properly?  Who knows?  Who cares?  \\"Who's next\\" is an amazing album as it is, for what it is.  Some of the best tracks in Rock history come from THIS album.  This album is a Masterpiece.  This album deserves a Sixth Star.  Now if Pete really wants us to hear his Lifehouse project as he intended it to be, he can re-release that multi-CD set from a few years ago, and price it so that we can actually hear it (I know of no one who has heard that old overpriced release - which is probably a real shame).  However, I'm not losing any sleep over it.<br /><br />Various CD editions of \\"Who's next\\":  I prefer this 16 track CD much better than the 2 disc, live included stuff.  However, you may like the 2 CD set, so check it out.  There comes a time when there are so many versions that you just have to see what looks most interesting to you and get it.  Getting this album, in whatever release, is a real treat.<br /><br />Update: May 2013<br />  OK, I confess, I broke down (a few years later now) and bought the 2 disk Deluxe Edition as well.  I just had to hear Disk Two which has the concert that was intended to be part of the LIFEHOUSE project. It is a good concert although (as others have said) The Who fan will have most of these songs in other concert CDs.  However, for those still curious about the LIFEHOUSE project, this is a major piece of that history.  Disk One, of course, has the original Who's Next album and it sounds very good.  The extras are studio versions of leftover LIFEHOUSE tunes, which are also good.  Again, if you don't own any version of Who's Next, there are several options - so take your time and find the one that suits your needs best (but you really ought to own at least A version of this great album).
B005CA4SJW|3.0|note, this is not a review of the series, if you want that other reviews have that, its a review of the features and box set itself, with that said, its a great series.  So i am one of the few ppl on this planet who actually likes audio commentary, and this has that in spades.  episodes one through six all have that.  theres the black and white pilot episode, which isnt as great as i was hoping, but its interesting to watch once. those are about the only great special features for the set, if you dont care for those, i suggest you buy the normal dvd set.  for a collectors set i was expecting better special feature, or at the very least a better box to put the dvds in.  the illustration on the dvds, and where you put them into are great, but the rest of the box design is sub par.  even something as small as a plastic cover to put the box into is missing.  i dont want to discourage anyone from buying this set, im happy with it, but thats only because i like audio commentary, other then that i highly suggest you buy the regular set for a reduced price.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I was tired of hearing all the nerdy friends I knew talk about how a great of a show this was.  Even worse, I hate tropes and cliches.  Having this show described as a combination of a western and sci-fi in space made me want to gag.  So I sat down and watched the first episode of the show.  Then I proceeded to watch every single episode and the movie in a span of 3 DAYS!!  The acting is fantastic, the would-be cliche moments are spun to a different effect, the mood of each episode was self-encapsulated yet also fit a grander continuous stream for the series as a whole.  I truly do understand why so many were upset at this show being cancelled.  I wish Joss Whedon had the means to continue to produce this brand and  simply release it off-network as I believe intelligent television viewers have lost something special.

1419702203|4.0|I admit having not yet read the text of GEORGE HARRISON: LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, but I'll say it is worth your time just for the photographs, of which there are plenty as this is a coffee table-sized book.  George Harrison was larger than life, and nothing short of big pictures are necessary to depict the man.<br /><br />It's still hard to believe we lost George Harrison ten years ago.  That he was a victim of attempted murder that may have aggravated the illness that took him at such a young age makes his passing even more difficult to accept.  Just as it is hearing his songs since 2001, GEORGE HARRISON: LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD proves bittersweet.<br /><br />Long live the music of George Harrison.

This book has a great sense of humor and I would encourage anyone to buy it. Shipping was fast and the book was in great condition.

B004GCPJDQ|1.0|As plenty of others have warned you - the battery pack design is awful. You are going to jam this thing into your Apple product - and you will never be able to remove it without destroying the mouse. In my case - I jammed it in and charged the mouse - nothing. And as I said - I had to destroy my mouse to get it out. I am getting a refund on the stupid charger, but of course - I have no recourse on the mouse.   Stick to traditional rechargeable batteries and forget this thing.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|\\"Psycho\\" is Alfred Hitchcock's best remembered film for several reasons:  It was shot in black and white in a time when color films had become predominant.  The leading actress is brutally  murdered forty minutes into the film.  The remarkable editing of the shower murder scene.  Bernard Herrmann's brooding and then terrifying music throughout the film.  The story is that Hitchcock owed Paramount a film to fulfill his contract.  To keep expenses at a minimum, Hitchcock chose to  shoot the film in black and white and to use his television production company, Shamley Productions.  Television production companies, generally worked at lower rates than those producing theatrical films.  The additional detail of Blu-ray has it's pluses and minuses here.  It makes it more obvious, at times, that this is a low budget production.  At the same time, the dramatically most arresting scene between Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins is when they discuss his mother's \\"illness.\\"  The Blu-ray definition makes the expressiveness in Perkins' eyes more intense and at times frightening.  This is, for me, the best scene in the picture with remarkable acting by Perkins and Leigh and Stefano's excellent dialog, augmented, no doubt, by Hitchcock himself.  Several Hitchcock films have an influential mother character:  Among them: Shadow of a Doubt, Notorious, Strangers on a Train, To Catch a Thief, The Man Who Knew Too Much (both versions), The Wrong Man, North by Northwest  and The Birds.  Psycho is the ultimate expression of that theme.

0345528581|4.0|I really like the book, and the author knows what he's talking about. even the nutritional info isn't  wrong a lot.   There are 125 exercises in the book which makes it a great reference tool when working out. The exercise regime is great and pretty much for everyone.  The only con i can come up with is that some exercises are far from bodyweight, i.e. require the use of weights, even if not in the form of dumbells. Another thing is that there are virtually no exercises for the upper back which don't involve suspending yourself from a monkey bar, a tree branch, pull up bar, or your door (which i wholeheartedly don't recommend, since my door certainly wouldn't suspend my weight). And there exist dynamic resistance exercise for the back which do the trick, just aren't mentioned.

B004LWZVZC|4.0|My wife and I saw this movie twice in the theater and will be getting the DVD.  The basic story is told through the other reviewers here so I won't go through the effort to re-write it again.   What must be remembered is that ALL historic movies are just that - MOVIES! If you want history, read some books. One reviewer did it right stating that after the movie, research was sought to find the true story. That's what everyone should do.  Mr. Redford did a fine piece of story telling, but as for history, much has been omitted. Mrs. Surratt was not the saintly woman he portrayed her as in this film.  I've met and spoken with authors of books such as \\"Assassin's Accomplice,\\" \\"American Brutus,\\" and \\"Lincoln's Avengers.\\" They do not all agree on Mrs. Surratt's guilt. More though do lean towards guilt.  My opinion is that she WAS guilty. The movie sways the viewer the other way. Still, my wife and I will own this movie.
1594484805|4.0|My Dad always told me, if you love what you do, it isnt work.  Drive does a great job of describing what motivates us, and in particular helps us understand those who aren't typical 9-5er's, but those who enjoy the challenges and opportunities that face them every day.  this book also provides transparency into the organizations that have implemented varying models that have led to insight and development for their organizations that wouldn't otherwise have existed.  In particular, any aspiring young leaders (not \\"managers\\".. as the book explains!) should read this book to help understand how to build a team that enjoys their job and to maximize throughput, while also explaining that throwing money at the team not only is ineffective, but can greatly hinder success.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|I saw this version originally when I was twelve.  Soon after I saw what turned out to be the the first remake in a video store and wanting to see it again talked my parents into renting it. Even then I knew it wasnt the same movie. Thankfully Peter Jackson came along years later and not only remade it a second time but stayed true to the original story. Some people may get mad at me for saying that but I dont care.  Other than to have King Kong and Ann become friends he didnt change the story at all. At least not in a way that would be obvious plot wise. If you want to watch a remake get Jacksons or the extented edition which is ten times better. Otherwise get this one. The firt remake should be left alone. Period. Unless you want to watch an inferior verion that is filled with flaws.As i already said other than to have King Kong and Ann become friends Jackson didnt change the story in any way that would stick out like a sore thumb. There are changes sure. Jack Driscols job is an example. In this one hes the ships first mate. In Jacksons he was a playwrite. But oter than having King Kong and Ann become friends changes like that youll have to search for by watching both movies which I would recomend. But except for the fact that this one is in black and white and Jacksons is in color I have pointed out the only difference that would stick out like a sore thumb and I dont need to mention it again. Both movies are very good. Peter Jacksons is better but that shouldnt stop you from watching this one. I have both of them. Coopers and Jacksons.
B004EPYZT4|2.0|I did not enjoy watching this new Conan the Barbarian movie  as much as the original with Arnold.  In this movie the photography, sets, special effects, costumes,  movie, stunts and acting are all better than the original.  But for some reason I had liked watching the older film version  of Conan The Barbarian better. I think it's because the original  version told a better story.
B00004TS0E|5.0|I watch this movie every Christmas eve just before I go to bed. Its become a tradition for me. Its one of my favorite Christmas movies. Ive always felt that the way they proove Kris is Santa Claus is genious. The daughter of one of the workers who doesnt believe in Santa Claus goes along with a plan of her mothers to proove whether Santa Claus exists and asks for three gifts that would be impossible to give. Another one of my favorites is Santa Claus the movie. Then theres the original Miracle on 34th Street. And so on down the list just like this one which is better than the original.  I saw this in the theater and have loved it ever since. You will too and you should get it. Youll be disappointed if you dont. Merry Christmas.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love the graphics, looks great on the Kindle Fire!  Wish it had all the mini games like the PC version.
B0064W67IM|4.0|I loved these stories in the trade paperback form, and I really looked forward to them on the Kindle Fire. The new Kindle Fire Comics with the pop-out panels are a surprisingly nice way to read comics; and I thought Watchmen in this format was a masterpiece. But I also knew Watchmen had a significant advantage in this regard: the entire series was drawn with an extremely regular panel grid, with only rare deviations. So pop-up rectangular panels suited it well. I expected the format to be more challenging for something with more panel variety -- especially something as downright experimental as Sandman.<br /><br />So I expected some of the pop-out choices to be difficult. I was ready to tolerate some unusual choices. And for the most part, they handled it well. They did a nice job with challenging panels like wide or tall panels with dialog balloons in many places.<br /><br />But in a few places, they just plain got it wrong. In some places they got the dialog order wrong, so an response pops out before the statement that prompted it. And in a few cases, they missed a dialog balloon entirely; and the only way I could read it was to switch to page mode. And worst of all, there were a couple of pages where the pop-outs didn't correspond to anything recognizable on the page: not to panels, not to dialog, not to revealing visual details, nothing. Do we really need a pop-out of Morpheus's elbow?<br /><br />So I knocked off a star for the imperfections. I hope DC takes the time to fix these after the mad rush of releasing 100 Kindle Fire Comics at once.

B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|In 1965 the Israeli Intelligence, Mossad, sent agents into East Berlin to capture the notorious war criminal, Vogel, the Surgeon of Birkneau. This film tells the story of the three agents.<br /><br />David, played by Sam Worthington, Rachel, played b Jessica Chastain, and Stefan, played by Marton Csokas, are Mossad agents. From the opening scene until the last, suspense is the word of the day. We have all seen what East Berlin was like, dark and dreary. Now, the three young people must plan and carry out their job. From one day to the next, danger is around the corner, and we are never sure of the plan. The danger of this film is that it moves from 1965 to 1997, when Rachel's now grown daughter writes a book telling of her exploits. The 1997 agents, now thirty years older, are played by Tom Wilkinson, Helen Mirren and Ciaran Hinds. This was a distraction for me, and I found the older characters more believable. In 1997, one of the characters realizes that he must tell his version of the truth and can no longer live a lie. This changes the path for the other two and brings the story of their exploits full circle.<br /><br />Any film with Helen Mirren is a good one. 'The Debt' is a film that is good but not great. The change of time from 1965 to 1997 is not even, and gives the film a confusing stance that takes time to understand. The story of the hunt for the Nazi criminal is an interesting one, but one that has been told many times. There are many twists and turns that kept this film alive for me. One of those suspenseful films that keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 12-18-11<br /><br />Prime Suspect: The Complete Collection<br /><br />Raising Helen [VHS]

B004EPYZSK|4.0|I have been a fan & collector of Harrison's for over 30 years.  I USED to be first in the door opening day for his films.  I did want to be there for this one but could not make it.  Now, we see latest Bond Craig throughout this movie & he got top billing.  Why, the current in the long list of this character.  No other hit movies.  Now, Harrison.  Let's see.  Oscar nominated for Witness.  Played two famous movie characters Han Solo & Indiana Jones.  Long time biggest movie money maker.    The film is good.  You have seen the ending a million times.  The Wilde character, I won't do spoilers here, you could guess.    Could  hardly see a lot of the night action.  Took forever to see the aliens.  Stole part of that idea from \\"Alien\\".  Normal special effects.    One of the talk shows Harrison appeared on to promote the film mention how 3 films in a row he played a grouchy guy.  Too many shots of Craig making that touch guy face.  A few extras on the DVD-nothing special.  No chapter search list.  AND, COMCAST COME ON.  We now get Comcast advertisements with DVD's.  TACKY!!  So, a good movie.  Pick out the seen before parts from other movies.
067082187X|1.0|I sort of liked the protagonist's (if we can call him that) little hobbitty relatives, but 30 pages or so of their witty repartee ensconced in 986 interminable pages of boring sex and self absorption is a pretty low return on my investment.
0446547654|1.0|I normally cannot wait to get my hands on a new Nicholas Sparks book, but this one is boring me to death!  I normally stay up all night to finish his books because I can't put them down.  The Best of Me is draaaaaaaagging.  I don't necessarily like the characters.  I don't really care about them.  I don't know why I'm supposed to care or be invested in them.  I really don't care to even finish the book.  I have had this book for over a month now - probably closer to two (who can keep up?) - and I only picked it up again because my kid is gone for the night, I'm bored, too lazy to go to the bookstore, and can't find anything good on TV.  I'll buy the next Nicholas Sparks book - of course - but I hope it is better than The Best of Me.  As my students would say, \\"This sucks big!\\"
0316044695|5.0|I rd this book when it came out, I really liked it a lot.  Super good story about the will to live.  The SEALS had to make a choice that cost them everything.

Rococo, Month of May, and City with No Children are the best songs and the rest of the album does not disappoint. This was the album that introduced me to indie music......... One of the best albums released in the past decade.
B000OPOAJS|2.0|This movie was so fast paced and so jumpy I had to use playback option to understand plots and subplots. mr. Robert has made better movies than this and acting was real bad. Love interet was not very good in her part plus she had real poor Irish accent.  Movie also had way to many bad guys and way to many plots for it wo be watchable.  I say if you pay more than $10 for this movie you are getting taken.  It is the kind of movie 1 viewing of it and you are done period.
B006AX6ONI|2.0|I really wanted to like this book because honestly Cuban is the kind of guy I would like to sit down and have a beer with and talk hoops or whatever.  This book was a huge downer for me.  He comes across, unfortunately to me at least, as a dumb jock in these short pages.<br /><br />Every sentence in this book to me feels like it should end with an exclamation point. There are parts in bold letters that make me think they were in all caps but the editor wouldn't let him do it.  There is nothing new or earth shattering held in the pages of this book.  As a matter of fact outside of the normal motivational drivel is a sadness. The sadness of failures, lost relationships and everything he gave up to become mega-rich.  Don't get me wrong being super wealthy like Cuban would be great but this is not a roadmap for anything but a trip to rah-rah land.<br /><br />It's just this ridiculous pump you up stuff that infomercials sold in the 80's.  I can see the 2:00am spot as I type this.  Cuban is decked out in a cabana top unbuttoned halfway exposing a gold chain, hairy chest and golden orange tan while techno beats play in the background in a movie set that resembles a mansion in the hills of California.  It just really isn't that inspirational considering what is out there to read.  If you want fist pumping techno music and love the word EXTREME this is your book.  It just sadly is not my thing at all.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|First, let me say: I have an Amazon Kindle Fire -- and I love it. This app is NOT the app that runs on the Kindle Fire. This app is, instead, what you run on an Android phone/tablet. With that being said:<br /><br />This app is crap. It's entire focus is to get you to BUY music, rather than stream music from your Amazon Cloud Drive. The app is incredibly commercial-centric. From the moment you start it up you're given two choices/buttons: Cloud Drive Music or Store. Each time you boot it up, you get the same two stupid buttons: Cloud Drive or Store. The \\"Store\\" is ever present, regardless of where  you may be within the app. What's more, the app continuously crashes hangs on my multiple devices: LG Optimus Slider, Motorola Triumph, and XOOM tablet. Regardless of whether you are using Froyo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, etc. EXPECT crashes and hangs. This app is total, total worthless crap if you have a lot of music on your Cloud Drive (like I do).<br /><br />Amazon could do sooo much better.... Again: Total crap.

161382145X|4.0|Some people seem determined to prove T.S. Elliot wrong. That's not the point here. The Moonstone is a well written book which continues to be a good early example of the detective novel. Poe did it better; but Collins was on the right path.<br />Yes, A.C. Doyle borrowed ideas from W. Collins. He borrowed even more from E.A. Poe. Doyle actively denied getting ideas from Poe on several occasions, but the proff is in his writings.
B002BWP49C|1.0|...this movie caused a vacuum bubble in my brain that took several hours to pop.  The story itself is of course so devoid of intelligence, logic, wit and creativity that there are no words to describe it. OK, no news here...  Obviously, this material can not be accessed with the mind - I have accepted this fact.  Since I'm absolutely no fan of the series, that's my first problem.  The sheer stupidity and offensiveness of the book/plot have been discussed all over the internet for years now, so I won't waste any time on this.  Instead, I'll just focus on the film as a film - which is a complete disaster.  It is slow and tedious, utterly harmless, the dialogue makes your hair curl. Forgettable soundtrack.  Even worse, it is a cold, heartless affair, with absolutely no romance or sensuality at all - I had to listen to quite a lot of Marvin Gaye afterwards to get warm again.  Even so, what enraged me the most is how it relentlessly rips off scenes from films that are  a hundred times better than itself.  My personal favorites :   1. when B. Swan and E. Cullen take their mumbled vows, the wedding guests seemingly disappear, leaving the two of them alone on the screen...    - stolen from \\"Pride And Prejudice\\", Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy dancing at the ball at Netherfield Park - unbelievable !  2. chess game on island    - stolen from the original \\"Thomas Crown Affair\\", where it is sexy and mesmerizing. Obviously, this effect is not repeated here - why ?    Because Kristen Stewart can't hold a candle to Faye Dunaway.    Because Pattinson is a million lightyears away from Steve McQueen.    Because the characters are in need of excessive therapy to cure their intimacy problems.  3. (the most outrageous one) Bella Bloody Swan opening her eyes for her regrettable return to (some sort of) life at the end    - here the film bluntly rips off the last shot of \\"Avatar\\", which I find particularly daft, since this marvelous movie is only 2 years old and every person on     earthseems to have seen it - I'm surprised they got away with that.  There is not much more to say about this thing, since there is so little in it.  It lacks any suspense, provides no intellectual stimulation, and there is no feeling or chemistry to compensate for those.  It lulls you into a vegetative state. The film itself would have benefitted from an adrenalin injection into it's heart. Or maybe venom, or orange juice, just any kind of fluid....  You couldn't find any humor in it even if you watched it through the Hubble Telescope.  It's quite amazing how all the carefully contrived problems, scarce as they are, miraculously solve themselves. Of course, this has to be attributed to the workings of Meyer's mind. Once again, I am in awe of the fact that something so dull and derivative can become such a success. What's the matter with people nowadays ?  The franchise resembles it's creations :  pale, ice cold, with no blood in it's veins, utterly lifeless - and still, it just won't die. Unfortunately, it doesn't sparkle - just like Mr. Cullen seems to have lost his silly glitter somewhere on the flight from Washington to Rio, which in the film appears to be about 2 hours long. Maybe he walked into the cockpit and used some vamp muscle on the throttle ?  An inexcusable waste of time and brain tissue.
0735105855|5.0|This book is unusual for a number of reasons. It raised a huge debate when it came out. Dorthy Sayers, who in addition to writing fine books herself was a published critic of literature and played an important role in setting out the rules of a murder mystery, came strongly to its defence. Her comments are well worth searching out and reading for yourself.<br />Unlike most novels of its type, it bear rereading.<br />Because I was at one time a professor of English literature and chose to offer a survey course in Detective Fiction, I have read this book many times and enjoyed identifying the many clever clues provided by the author.<br />Christie plays fair with the reader and presents a tale which stands out among the thousands which have been written. I encourage you to experience this unusual and satifying book.
B004A8ZWVK|2.0|Did a perky white woman ever give Rosa Parks the strength to stay in her seat?  The cardboard baddie and her drones are unrealistic.  I liked the performance of the two maids which leads me to wonder why they weren't the protagonists.  Chick flick reminiscent of Fried Green Tomatos but in no way measures up.  (This review reflects my opinion of the movie only and not the book which I haven't read.)

Sergeant Samantha Cole (Sam) joins forces with him to find the killers, and after some initial doubts on his part becomes a great help and a good friend. But Puller soon realizes nothing is quite as it seems on the surface and that he can't trust anyone, even the so-called authorities. Are the murders somehow connected to a much bigger bomb plot that could destroy untold thousands? For sheer excitement this fast-paced thriller never lets you down.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I looked at some of the other Mahjong games, but I picked this one because it was straightforward and easy, but still gave me lots of levels to choose from. The tiles are clear and large enough on my phone to play...even in the portrait position (but I haven't tried all the levels yet). My only complaint is that you have to press somewhat hard to select the tiles, but I'm thinking it could be me. This is my first Android phone and I'm still trying to get used to the keyboards and the pressure I should use for selecting the right things. My real rating is 4 1/2 stars. In spite of that, I'm still pleased with my choice.

B005URRCUY|4.0|I'm an old timer from the 70's. This is the best Black Keys CD since Rubber Factory. Every release in between this and that has been choppy at best. Only a few songs such as \\"I GOT MINE\\" and \\"SHE'S LONG GONE\\" have been worth more than a listen or two. This CD harkins back to what the Black Keys do best - ROCK! Maybe not their best, but close.  \\"GOLD ON THE CEILING\\", \\"LITTLE BLACK SUBMARINES\\", and \\"MONEY MAKER\\" are good stuff. El Camino is meant to make your feet and head move to the tempo. The guitar work is very good as well. It may not be as raw as Rubber Factory, or as inventive, but let's face it, they're filling up stadiums now and simply can't sound like their playing out of a garage.   So, if you want to listen to a more soulful or bluesy R&B sound, like many of the songs off their previous two CD's,then this isn't for you. If you want to listen to good old fashion rock and roll, buy this CD.

1451627289|5.0|What a great read !!  Stephen King kept me in one sort of suspense or another from first to last.  The book is, actually, a love story.  Love of man for woman.  Love of life.  What a gift !  Much better writing than most present-day writers -- even some of the Pulitzer winners.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|The sound on this video is turned down so low that we had to turn the volume of our TV up full blast, and then move our chairs closer. The movie itself is good, but the sound quality of the actual video was very poor. I think Disney might've done this on purpose to keep people from showing it to large groups.
B0068AWQQ2|4.0|Fun.  Visual upgrade from the original.  The memorable, 'Evil', character, quirky, irreverent, and the 80's horror film staple researcher was captured brilliantly by the artist formerly known as Mclovin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|I loved Viola Davis, Jessica Chastain and a lot of the acting in this film, but I did feel that it was the hundredth movie I've seen where if it wasn't for a noble white person then the black characters would be doomed. I felt this way after THE BLIND SIDE as well. It's not to say that the movie itself is racist or anything like that but maybe paternalistic? Things were terrible in the South to say nothing of Mississippi around the time of the Medgar Evers assassination, much worse than maids being disallowed from using their employers' toilets. I think the sheer level of every day prejudice is sometimes forgotten with stories like this one.
B00197U0DU|4.0|There is alot of negativity that surrounds this album. I have been a huge genesis fan for a few years now and was always aware of this album. I think I purposly avoided hearing it due to all the bad reviews I either read in books or magazines. After listening to it I wish I would have bought it years ago. From Genesis To Revelation is a superior art pop album, nothing more nothing less. It is different sounding than there 70s masterpieces however not radically so. It is closes to the album Tresspass as far as the tone and atmopsphere are concerned. A song like Am I Very Wrong would have fit perfectly on Tresspass. There are so many reasons to like this album. peters voice hasnt become the bombastic powerhouse it would later prove to be, it is still very signature sounding peter gabriel, espeacially on songs like In The Wilderness. the insturmentation is very spare but still works. From Genesis To Revelation should not be the first album by the band you hear, but if you enjoy the bands other recordings than you will find much to enjoy here as well.

0385535139|5.0|At times it's over the top and is a little hard to swallow, but if you're like me & are after a fun escapist & entertaining read you could do a lot worse. It's a real page turner & hard to put down even if it's a bit unrealistic. I'm not going to go into details as I don't want to spoil the plot.  I had never read a Grisham novel before as I don't have any legal knowledge & I was concerned that there might be legal mumbo jumbo/jargon which thankfully wasn't the case so don't be afraid to give Grisham a go.

B001UV4XFG|3.0|The seller had shipped it immediatly, which was nice. But I am rating on the movie itself. I always like the book better. And in case of the Twilight series, the books are much better than the movies!
B0058VW36U|4.0|OmNom is the cutest candy eating monster ever! Got the game when AppStore offered it free one day. Now that there are updates available, c'mon Amazon, make these updates available to this game's addicted fans. Great work, ZeptoLab!!

B005HJWWW8|3.0|I have never used a portable amplifier before purchasing the Fiio E6. I agree with the other reviews that it makes a big difference to have this small device hooked up to my headphones. However, after charging it up by using the USB cable connected to my PC, I find that I get only 5-6 hours of use before the device shuts down and I have to recharge it. There is no warning. I'm listening and then suddenly no sound as the battery dies. 5-6 hours of use after charging seems unreasonably short for a modern electronic device. There should be an indicator light to let us know that the battery needs recharging. My next purchase will be an amp with longer battery life.

B004N6369Y|2.0|Pleasant enough story but not much of plot Lots of repetition, as other reviews said &#34;we get it already&#34; Thought I was getting a DS bestsller but got a dime store novel instead
B004EPYZSU|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  If you just let yourself enjoy it and do not try to pick part the impossibilities it is a fun ride.  If you want reality watch the history channel or science channel.  Little hokie in parts, but interesting and fun.
0060873027|1.0|Until now, I thought that the worst Michael Crichton book was TIMELINE, or maybe the one about the half-chimpanzee human child.  Both were stinkers, but MICRO is a new low.  And to make matters worst, it apparently will have a sequel. \\"Don't Forget Michael Crichton,\\" indeed. MICRO is your evidence that the family and Preston have. Save your money.
0811869261|5.0|An excellent book for young kids, but appealing for other ages too. This is the story of Mouk, a little bear who goes on a trip around the world. The book emphasizes different cultures, customs, etc. It teaches a few words in different languages and the illustrations are very thoughtfully made - details that link across a busy, colorful page, that kids can discover as they look at it and understand it better each time.  I wish we had more books with Mouk available in English...  Makes a great gift too.
B003Y5H5AQ|1.0|I thought this movie was just AWWFUL. It takes away from what the smurfs are and mean to a bunch of 80s saturday morning cartoon watchers. It's just another franchise that hollywood destroyed. The 1 star is for the special features. I actually rate this movie a 0, but the special features were worth the rental off netflix. It started pretty good but when they went into the city, it was terrible. in short I would not rent or buy this. Maybe rent off Netflix, that way it's free and no money is spent on a garbage movie. All smurf fans should rent this to see how it is, but DON'T SPEND ANY MONEY ON IT! The Chipmunks movies were alot better.   SPECIAL FEATURES  2 Commentaries  A documentary Smurfs from Comics to screen.  A Smurfs Christmas Carol {Which isn't on this Blu-Ray}  and more.  They did a OK, job on the features but that's all I can say that's positive other than the beginning of the film.

0811836363|5.0|I got this book for my sister for her 18th birthday and she's a big book lover and it's taking her awhile to read it because the book is so big and it has small print. She loves it though. She says when you read it, you can hear their voices telling a story. She's a big Beatles fan, but is still learning things she didn't already know from this book. We definitely recommend this book to all Beatles lovers.
B002SQNM9A|5.0|This review is not for the actual product but the condition it was in when I received it. I ordered this cd NEW for my daughter for Christmas. When it arrived the cd case was cracked/damaged. I do not have time to return/exchange it for a new one. I am very disappointed that I have to give this to her in this condition. In the future, how about taking extra time to ensure the items you ship are in PERFECT/NEW condition (what the customer expects and pays for).
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Purchased for Kindle Fire and works great.  Difficulty level scales appropriately.  Animations and piece movement are well done and easy to use.

B0002WZTOI|4.0|Not much need to review this one after over four hundred people took a shot...it is just a remarkable film for excitement and a great love story. The actors were superb and in their primes - how Top Gun II will fare is yet to be determined. A whole new generation is discovering how fantastic this \\"old\\" movie is...one of the classics!
0375842209|5.0|This is not only the best book I have read on the holocaust, it is probably one of the best books I have ever read period. I cried when it was over, composed myself then started crying again. Gut-wrenchingly beautiful.

B005AUWY2W|3.0|It's definitely a watchable movie but it centers a lot on Tow-Mater, not necessarily one of my favorite characters in the movie.  It was cute in the first one, but it leaves a bit to be desired in the second.  It's like many other sequels...they're trying to play on a popular character.  I can see where that would work, but it was not one of my faves.  But all in all, it was worth the watch if you can buy the movie for a bit under regular retail.  I purchased the blu-ray and DVD combo for about $16.50...at the time a great deal.  It was an hour and a half of fairly enjoyable entertainment, but really, I liked the first one better.
B001IHJ97E|1.0|I hoped to relive the original story in a comfortable format when I purchased this \\"remastered\\" version of Brainstorm. Sadly, this remastered version is not in a format fit for viewing. The original concept was to present scenes viewed from the aspect of the individual wearing the experimental headset in one format, while the balance of the shots were presented in another format. In this rendition, the scenes from the aspect of the experimenter are presented in great widescreen format with high quality Dolby sound. Unfortunately, most of the story is not presented from the aspect of the experimenter and is put forth in a small format with no appreciable sound quality at all. Be prepared to squint a lot and keep adjusting the volume. Maybe someday this interesting project will be produced in a fashion so that we may all enjoy it without working at it.

The what if scenario in this one is nano-particles gaining intelligence and trying to take over humanity. I felt the book was weak and had several shortcomings. After just finishing Timeline, which was engrossing, I say borrow it from a library.<br />The narrator does a fine job, but the whole story was missing something.

0452287022|5.0|What is it about this quiet novel about an Old Master painting that has appealed to so many readers in its decade-plus in print? Have so many people \\"discovered\\" the great painter Vermeer that they're attracted to anything that can reveal more about him or his renowned painting, Girl With a Pearl Earring? Clearly the Scarlet Johanssen movie has boosted its long shelf life, a favor it deserves.<br /><br />Chevalier set herself the ambitious task of imagining a life for the anonymous young woman in the painting, a work she must have been in love with. I know the feeling: a large framed print of it hangs above our piano, and I never tire of looking at it.<br /><br />Much like the Mona Lisa, the Meisje met de Parel is captivating. You view the young woman in it with wonder: Who is she, and what is she thinking? What is her relationship to Johannes Vermeer, who, with Rembrandt and Frans Hals, was one of the most important artists of the Dutch Golden Age.<br /><br />At the time of the novel, the 17th century, the Netherlands was at its apex of power and wealth, wallowing in profits from shipping, slaving, fishing, and war profiteering. Girl With a Pearl Earring takes place in Delft, famed for its blue and white ceramics.<br /><br />Sixteen-year-old Griet is forced into service with the Vermeer household when a kiln explosion blinds her father. Soon she's grinding the master's paints, and eventually she poses for a painting.<br /><br />The bare bones of the plot sound ominously dull, but the story lies in the flesh. The pleasures of the flesh include domestic intrigue, unrequited love and depictions of the artist's life. Also, sexual jealousy, grief and ambition, all conveyed through the voice of a complex and unforgettable character, young Griet.<br /><br />Vermeer's trust in the new maid catapults the rest of the household into a frenzy of resentment. Griet must get her work done in an atmosphere of relentless manipulation and persecution. Despite her simple background, she is absorbed by the ingredients and process of making art. She understands the degree of Vermeer's artistry and feels the power of his vision.<br /><br />The character of Vermeer remains somewhat vague, a man of few words and limited interactions. His pregnant and crabby wife Catharina--Griet's worst foe--is more vividly portrayed. An imperious social climber, she's tormented by the arrangement between her husband and the maid, as who wouldn't be.<br /><br />Fortunately Griet's modesty is no match for her Dutch hardheadedness. She knows the volatile situation requires a back-up plan and keeps the butcher boy's interest at a boil.<br /><br />In the end Vermeer asks too much of her. Girl With a Pearl Earring is a subtler, more artful variation of the classic maid's story. Here, at least, Griet is repaid with immortality.<br /><br />Reviewed by Rebecca Burke<br />Author of When I Am Singing to Youshe is absorbed by the ingredients and process of making art.

1442419814|5.0|I first read this series in 7th grade, and it always feels fresh every time I reread them.  It is so different and cool, and all four are must-reads.<br /><br />Tally Youngblood is an Ugly, which is anyone from twelve to sixteen who is not surgically altered, and longs for the day she turns sixteen and leaves Uglyville forever and becomes a perfect, stunning Pretty, who has nothing to do but party.  While spying on New Pretty Town to see her best friend Peris, she finds out he is an entirely different person, and wants nothing to do with her until she becomes a Pretty and moves to New Pretty Town.  In order to escape, Tally preforms a not-very-smart stunt and narrowly gets away.  On her way out, she becomes stuck, and meets another Ugly named Shay.  As they escape together, they become find out that they have the same birthday, so they will both turn Pretty together.  But Shay doesn't want to be a Pretty.  When Shay escapes to the secret, rebellious, anti-Pretty place called The Smoke, she leaves a set of directions that only Tally understands in case she changes her mind.<br /><br />Tally is soon forced to choose between perfection and what is right, because it turns out that the world of the Pretties isn't very pretty at all.  One of the best dystopian novels I have ever read.  Scott Westerfeld has created a masterpiece.
1878424939|5.0|I wish I had read this book 40 years ago. I recommend it to everyone asking why they are here.
B001AW156U|5.0|The triggers clip on easily and are very well made.  There is no chance of these things coming off unless i wanted them to.  They really hold up to the stress of intense gaming.  Enough Said!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Pros:  Item is very compact and light weight, the price is reasonable, and it seems to do an okay job.<br />Cons:  Not really any that I can think of yet.  I have not had it very long....it may do a better job than I'm aware of also, it could be that my technique is off!
B003L77G8I|5.0|This is my favorite tv series(of course I only watch 3) but still.  It is funny and mysterious and dramatic and can be very very sad.  Even after six years the episodes still keep me interested and there are no repeats.  The writers and actors are both great.  You can tell this is really a team effort each week.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|App is garbage on the fire.  I can stand next to the routed will full connection and it can't open.  It gives a message saying network error.
B004EPZ084|5.0|I thought this film was very funny and also made me think of all the bosses that I have had through the years.  All of the actors deserve credit for great acting roles.  This is a keeper and I will watch it many times.
B004W4N55C|3.0|Works for the most part and the tools are nice.  The tabs pages display just fine, but for some reason, I can't get the chords pages to come up.  It keeps on saying that there was failure in the connection whenever I try to look up the chords for a song.  Kinda annoying since I mainly play with chords.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very fun game and great at keeping you busy. I received this app free but would recommend even if it wasn't.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The music in the game is very mellow and relaxing. You can play the game at your own pace. there are no time limits or fancy touch skills required, but the puzzles really make you think. Acheiving a perfect score in each level can be quite the challenge, providing hours of fun. A great game and a great value!
B005LJITS0|4.0|This movie is truer to it's roots than many other of it's genre and I found that refreshing.  Gorgeous, sizzling hot superhero,beautiful girl to save, and a psychologically tortured villian - yes! I would say this movie is not for someone looking for mech-tech carnage, but a good romp inside a comic book of yesteryear.

B005POK858|5.0|I love RPG's. And this one is quite good for my phone. Be careful, it is addictive and very time consuming. I do love wandering around and beating up on creatures. I hate it when the story progresses. Then it turns into talk-talk-talk-talk. But I really, really enjoy this. Just be forewarned, time disappears mysteriously while playing this game.  Controls are simple and easy to use. You can hold down the arrows to keep walking in a direction. Don't tap like I did until I figured that simple thing out. Easy to navigate around, too.  If you like RPGs then pick this up!!

B004LWZW4M|1.0|Mankind brought this destruction upon itself because a couple of sadists treated a few research apes badly?<br /><br />And a bleeding heart played by James Franco decided to side with those apes when they went on a destructive rampage against humans?<br /><br />All taking place in that bastion of liberal insanity called San Francisco?<br /><br />Because of that, the apes took rule, killing an untold number of humans -- both nice guys and bad guys -- just so Franco could feel good about himself?<br /><br />This isn't the story about the \\"rise\\" of the apes, but about the narcissism of Franco's character.<br /><br />It's preposterous PC BS of the kind that PETA -- I'm sure -- loves.<br /><br />In the original 1968 movie with Charleton Heston, which was released at the height of the Cold War, when Heston's character comes across the Statue of Liberty half buried in the sand it's made pretty clear that mankind managed to destroy itself through warfare, and the apes evolved out of that catastrophe while the humans devolved. That was the dogma throughout the series: that mankind's catastrophic actions caused it to destroy itself as an intelligent species. We blew ourselves up and the intelligent apes evolved out of the ashes.<br /><br />This movie completely tosses all of that into a cocked hat.
0061974307|4.0|A very well written, timely and thought provoking story.  I enjoyed the book very much. The characters  were well defined and each had their own compelling story that connected smoothly with the larger story. The author gave us insite to a culture whose practices are unheard of in our western society.
0525423656|5.0|I got this as a gift for my daughter who teaches English. She will be able to preview it and recommend it to students in her classes.  The service was extremely prompt and the book is in perfect condition.
B004X80QNG|4.0|I've been using this on my ipod for a few years, and pretty much died when I saw this up for free app of the day.   I don't see why everyone is complaining. It syncs with all my Google calendars, Google Tasks, and Toodledo flawlessly. It's even easier to add events with complex repeats through PI than through the stock calendar.   This does really need a widget, though.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|Better. than. sketch. book . I like the ability to create designs and insert them as notes.  Great functionality for a novice like me.
0439023513|2.0|There were so many loose ends, and so many plot lines to make a better ending.  The \\"pearl\\" which is mentioned so many times, is forgotton. Katniss spends much of the time in the hospital, with someone else telling her what happened.  Should they make a third movie, they should throw this book away, and let someone who knows how to write give us the ending we deserved.
B004SBBDB2|4.0|The one problem I'm experiencing is that it doesn't always recognize or send the signal to the television upon connection. I found that I have to go into the iPhone settings and change TV-out from NTSC to PAL and vice-verse to get it started. Once the signal works it is fine until you disconnect. Changing apps can sometimes cause a disconnect where the TV-out setting has to be changed again. Otherwise, the cable works as intended. Slideshows, Netflix, etc.. all work great. Though this is not 1080p video, there are no issues with the picture quality being choppy or similar. It is acceptable and a savings over the Apple branded cables, which might also have the same issues. This review is based on my experience with an iPhone4 running IOS 5.  Notes:   1. Figuring out which red connector is audio or video is not hard to do. The green and blue connectors are video. The red connector hanging out with green and blue video connectors is for video.  The other red connector, next to the white connector, is for audio.  2. You need an Apple TV or similarly AirPlay equipped device in order to send audio/video form your iPhone/iPad over wireless to your television. This cable is a lower cost solution, plus it keeps your iPhone/iPad charged while it is connected.
B004DK5CYM|4.0|As a young sports writer, I remember watching Secretariat win the Kentucky Derby in 1973 from the Churchill Downs pressbox. I'd also seen Riva Ridge -- owned by Meadow Stable, trained by Lucien Lauren and ridden by Ron Turcotte -- win the Derby the previous year. Meadow Stable had a lot of big-name horses. After Secretariat lost the Wood Memorial, Mrs. Tweedy was quoted as saying she should have entered Upper Case (a speed horse from Meadow Stable) in the race instead of or along with Secretariat. If the stable was in such a corner financially as portrayed in the movie, it would have been entering horses in high-paying stakes races left and right rather than thinking the only option was selling its bellcow. But even knowing all this, I enjoyed the movie as fictional entertainment with some facts thrown in. And Secretariat certainly changed the sports scene in America by becoming the first triple crown winner in a quarter century, returning horse racing to the headlines, at least for a while, with Seattle Slew following up with another triple crown win the following year and the Foolish Pleasure/Ruffian match race a couple of years later keeping the Sport of Kings on the cover pages of sports sections nationwide.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Amazon told me it is compatible with my device: LGE LG-LS670, but it could not run after purchasing and installation.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Do not install this game on your device!!!! You'll never get any work done! LOL Very addictive. Unbelievable amount of levels. Fantastic for a free game. Ads on a Kindle Fire are hardly noticeable. My wife doesn't play anything other than solitaire but will spend hours on this. Great time killer.
0525423656|2.0|I really wanted to like this sequel to Matched but it was very disappointing. I enjoyed the Ky narration. Not the Cassia narration. She lost her voice and though she claimed to have alot of strength and growth, she basically was still being reactive instead of proactive. Like a wet noodle. I don't know if I'll bother with the last book of the series since I'm so disappointed.
0439023521|5.0|This book draws you in right from the beginning.  It is a very quick read but full of action and adventure.  The Hunger games are a horrible game put on by the capitol (of what was once America), and Katniss must fight to survive.  I barely put it down and am now almost done with Catching Fire.  So if you are looking for something quick to read that will keep your interest peaked, I recommend this book/series.
B00005JKG9|5.0|This is a great movie that all must see!  Loaded with a line up of AAA characters!  Great price, great shipping! I would completly recommend this movie to anyone!

B004SKHJF2|1.0|Doesn't load correctly on my Acer Iconia A500. Now I'm wondering how android has in their quality control of these apps. apple would never allow an app to fail.
B0002858YS|4.0|Love the Killers and this is probably their best album.  First few songs are definitely the best, especially Jenny Was a Friend of Mine, Mr Brightside, Somebody Told Me, and All These Things I've Done (my favorite Killers song...first time I heard it I fell in love with them...)  They remind me of a cross between David Bowie, The Cure and Duran Duran--weird combination (kind of) but my favorite bands when I was a teenager.
0525423656|4.0|It was the cover that compelled me to buy and then read Matched. Not all covers deliver, but this one did. Of course, Matched closed with a cliffhanger, so I was driven to read the sequel, Crossed. This week I finished it.<br /><br />Crossing is told in alternating points-of-view, one chapter told by Ky followed by one chapter told by Cassia. Cassia is off to the Outer Provinces in search of Ky. When she arrives, she learns that Ky has left for the canyons. Again she sets out in search of him. When they finally reunite, things don't go as well as they had hoped and the book ends with the two estranged.<br /><br />Not quite as good as Matched (something I almost always find with sequels), but close enough to recommend this story to those who liked Matched.
B000GY729M|4.0|Took me a while to start loving the Killers, but now I think they are one of the best out there.  Their songs are very catchy and hard to get out of your head (in a good way.) This album is very good, maybe not one of their best, but there are some great songs on it. Favorites are When We Were Young and Read My Mind.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|So when I received this item the out end of the fiio amplifier only outputted half of sound. So i am getting a refund hopefully and hopefully try ordering another one.

B0000700KQ|5.0|The director, Mr. David Lynch, is surely in the traditon of surrealism. And a question of mine on surrealism has been whether the encounter of the sewing machine and the umbrella was really fortuitous. As for the works of DL, I think the answer is sometimes YES and sometimes NO.   I am dubious about the fortuity, and think definitely that this film, Mulholloand Dr, was not made fortuisously but very deliberately. The storyline is, of course, as anticipated, very much twisted, but very well structured. You must watch it at least two times to see it, but then you will understand that DL was exceptionally generous to provide detailed information on the structure of this heart-aching tragedy, in contrast to artificial ambiguity seen in some other works of him. Excuse me for my poor English but I really love this film.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2\\" is a two-hour, action-packed conclusion to the Harry Potter saga. I can't say that it is especially climactic. The film suffers from being separated from \\"Part 1\\" and left to simply play out the final battle. \\"Part 2\\" isn't as strong as \\"Part 1\\", dramatically or thematically, and it is disorienting to pick up the story on the beach just after Dobby the Elf has been buried. Now the trio of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) conspire to break into Bellatrix Lestrange's (Helena Bonham Carter) vault at Gringott's in search of another of Voldemort's horcruxes, in which the Dark Lord harbors a part of his soul. From there it is on to Hogwart's, now under virtual marshal law, to prepare to confront Voldemort face-to-face.<br /><br />This material would have fared better if Warner Brothers hadn't split Harry Potter's final year into two films. All of the thematic substance and dramatic tension were in \\"Part 1\\", so we have forgotten about it in the intervening months. Talk of the Deathly Hallows is easily confused with the horcruxes, as they are both objects being sought, and the audience has probably forgotten why. This film is dedicated to the final battle, which is anticlimactic, because the build-up that would make the confrontation with Voldemort significant was in the earlier film. Meaningful interaction between characters is limited, in favor of action, so the actors just seem to be going through the motions. There is plenty of superfluous material that could have been cut from both films to create a single 3-hour-plus extravaganza. Bifurcating the finale doesn't do it justice.<br /><br />As both parts of \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\" are available on DVD now, one might be tempted to watch them back-to-back. That might make \\"Part 2\\" more coherent, suspenseful, and give it some context, but I doubt that children or most adults will have the patience for a four-and-a-half-hour marathon. The unnecessary scenes will be all the more apparent.

1594203059|4.0|An excellent book, from Niall Ferguson, a professor at both Harvard University and the Harvard Business School, who's probably the top historian of our Times, together with Paul Kennedy. When he writes something, you should take notice. You many not agree with him on everything (I certainly don't) but his book is never going to be a waste of your time!<br /><br />Perhaps the most disturbing fact about this book is the similarity in title (and argument) with Roger Scruton's excellent 2003 book entitled: [[ASIN:1882926811 The West and the Rest: Globalization and the Terrorist Threat]]. Scruton's essay delves into the roots of the clash with Muslim civilization and examines such aspects as the West's hyper-individualism and culture of repudiation and concepts like multiculturalism, immigration and progress - things that Ferguson does not concern himself with.<br /><br />Instead, Ferguson starts with an intriguing question: \\"Just why, beginning around 1500, did a few small polities on the western end of the Eurasian landmass come to dominate the rest of the world?\\"<br /><br />No question about it, he's done a superb job in identifying six factors at work in our civilization that largely explain the West's rise and dominance over the rest of the planet over the past 500 years. Whether you like it or not, whether you can't abide by the West's imperialist past, it still remains a fact:  the West has shaped how everyone acts, thins and dresses on the face of this earth - including those who dress \\"against\\" the West, by openly and defiantly clinging to their burqas and other traditional garments.<br /><br />The six factors at work - or \\"killer apps\\" as Ferguson so aptly calls them, \\"killer apps\\" are: (1) economic competition, (2) the Scientific Revolution, (3) the rule of law and representative government based on private property rights, (4) modern medicine and health care, (5) the Consumer Society, (6) the work ethic combined with higher savings rates and capital accumulation.<br /><br />This does a pretty convincing job of explaining the rise of the West - except for the fact that Ferguson does not take into consideration the effects of the \\"Columbian Exchange\\", which is somewhat surprising considering how well read he is. The \\"Columbian exchange\\" is a new concept very well presented by Charles C. Mann in his latest book ([[ASIN:0307265722 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created]]) that explains why with the global spread of disease and/or plants after Columbus had discovered America some civilizations (example the Chinese from the 1600s onwards) have collapsed. Because to explain the rise of the West, it helps to also explain why the rest might have started sliding down.<br /><br />But the real issue I have with Ferguson's book is that he doesn't do a very thorough job in explaining the (coming) downfall of the West (should it come - and I for one, do believe it will and that it has already started). Ferguson mentions anthropologist Jared Diamond's grand theory of cyclical rise and fall based on the observation that societies, through their very success, end up abusing their natural environment and causing their own downfall (as he convincingly argues in his book [[ASIN:0143117009 Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed: Revised Edition]], with a slew of striking examples ranging from the Maya to Easter Island).<br /><br />Ferguson doesn't like Diamond's theory, he doesn't really like any theory that sees the historical process as cyclical, from birth to maturity to death. And he asks the question: \\"what if History is not cyclical and slow-moving but arrhythmic - sometimes almost stationary but also capable of violent acceleration?...What if collapse is not centuries in the making but strikes a civilization suddenly, like a thief in the night?\\"<br /><br />An intriguing idea. Sure civilizations, as Ferguson writes, are \\"highly complex systems...They operate somewhere between order and disorder - on the 'edge of chaos' in the phrase of computer scientist Christopher Langton.\\" He points to the collapse of the Soviet Union with the fall of the Berlin Wall as the most recent example of \\"precipitous decline\\".<br /><br />And this is where he begins to lose me. Sure, he talks knowingly of all sorts of factors at work, from the financial crisis of 2007 to the Euro crisis to the rise of China as a major economic power poised to surpass the United States. It all makes for fascinating reading. But not convincing. Because he seems to have lost sight of his definition of the \\"West\\" as short hand for \\"western civilization\\". For example, when the Chinese decide to overtake the \\"West\\", they do it with a \\"new grand strategy\\" that Ferguson summarizes as based on \\"Mao-fashion, as the 'Four Mores':<br />1. Consume more<br />2. Import more<br />3. Invest abroad more<br />4. Innovate more\\"<br /><br />If you examine the 'Four Mores', you realize immediately that what the Chinese are doing is apply completely Western factors or \\"killer apps\\" to use Ferguson's metaphor. By that argument, if China surpasses the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia (to cite the countries most closely associated with the \\"West\\" concept) in the course of the 21st century, it will NOT signify a downfall of the West as a civilization. It's just a continuation in another corner of the planet!<br /><br />Ferguson is probably right when he argues that people have lost faith in their own civilization - people in the old West (I mean the countries I've just mentioned above) but obviously not China! So, in my view, China is somehow the heir of the West, just as the United States was heir to European civilization around the 1900s...<br /><br />Ferguson ignores or rather rejects Huntington's [[ASIN:1451628978 The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order]] argument, reminding us that none of his predictions have come to pass. Huntington had predicted (in his own words)that \\"conflicts between groups in different civilizations will be more frequent, more sustained and more violent than conflicts between groups in the same civilization\\". True enough, so far we've had more wars within civilizations than between civilizations: Ferguson cites the numbers and takes comfort in them. Of the 30 major armed conflicts that have taken place 12 years after the publication of Huntington's essay, he argues that \\"only nine could be regarded as being in any sense between civilizations, in the sense that one side was predominantly Muslim and the other non-Muslim\\".<br /><br />Only nine? But even if it were just one, it would be one too many. And one to worry about! No, I cannot agree with Professor Ferguson and take comfort in such numbers. This is not a question of numbers, but of what direction our civilization is taking. And there's little doubt that it is under siege by a \\"side that [is] predominantly Muslim\\", whether our civilization is flourishing in China or the old West (indeed, the Chinese have problems with their Muslim minorities too...)<br /><br />I just wish Ferguson had not dismissed other major thinkers this way because his conclusive chapter could have been much stronger than it is! Which is why I've given his book - otherwise magnificently written and researched - only 4 stars here and on Goodreads.collapse of the Soviet Union with the fall of the Berlin Wall as the most recent example of \\"precipitous decline\\".

B003U0AHBO|3.0|Well, this is probably going to be the last pairing of Crowe and Scott for some time; a $200 million budget blown on a confused - albeit well intentioned - origin piece.  In a way, it's not all wasted time for the duo - if this is a commercial flop like Scott's last medieval-driven effort, Kingdom of Heaven, he may look to directing an Alien prequel far more quickly.  Gladiator was a pleasant fluke, guys.  Not that I should be one to be analyzing Scott's portrayal of the iconic english outlaw.  My earliest and strongest memories of robin hood still reside alongside cartoony foxes and Cary Elwes.  But I don't need a hand on the backstory to know that Robin Hood's story is one that's meant to embody the spirit of adventure, courage, and heroism in the face of injustice.  And there's really not much of that here.  The scope feels smaller than it actually is, and that'd be okay if the little scenes felt as if they had any real depth or enthusiasm kicked into them.  Instead, we're left with something that's as flat as a pancake and not nearly ambitious enough to warrant much interest aside from good performances and high production values.  Perhaps it was restrained in order to provide authenticity and historical accuracy, but even that falls way short of standards when things start to get a little sloppy midway through, eventually coalescing to make a wholly implausible conclusion that may or may not aid in the making of a sequel.  I can't immediately say if I want one or not.  The performances are certainly worthy of digging, though.  Say what you will of Crowe and his short fuse on and off the set, he still the go-to ruffian role player.  Mark Strong, the only villain that we get the satisfaction of seeing slain, is just popping up everywhere these days, and I can't really say that I'm discouraged by that.  He's got a future, for sure, and if his supporting efforts remain this consistent, a lead role is in the books.  Veterans Blanchett, Hurt and  the immaculate Von Sydow share little screen time (actually, I don't think Hurt ever manages to get in the way more than I would've liked him to), but are a joy to watch, nonetheless.  Danny Huston, a personal favorite of mine, also makes an appearance as the doomed King Richard, but the film's excessive length means that you'll likely have forgotten about him by the time the credits begin to roll.  But the real draw should have been Ridley Scott, who's directorial hit-or-miss margins seem to be growing more whacky by the year.  The guy's a visionary, but it seems as if the new generation of filmmaking isn't gelling well with him.  His heart still belong's to science fiction, even if he doesn't know it yet.

B002NXSRVG|2.0|It's not that I don't accept summer blockbusters for what they are; the industry would be foolish to deny audiences these enjoyable dollops of mental junk food during our summer months.    That said, this summer has certainly met its quota for the year, with Joe being just short of an excessive addition.  Unable to distinguish itself from other cinematic behemoths of the past few months - aside, perhaps, from its admirable ability to never take itself seriously - Sommers' tireless action romp feels stale this late in the game.  The film consistently teeters on the edge of self-conscious family fun and uninspired, shallow flash that cant compensate for being late to the blockbuster party.    That said, it's truly difficult to criticize Joe too much in the wake of a certain other summer juggernaut that used similar elements of enticement to lure audiences in, only to make them suffer through worthless side stories and slapstick comedy (I'm throwing tomatoes at YOU, Mr. Bay).  Here's two hours of film that knows what it is, and isn't afraid to work with what its got to the fullest extent.  The acting, like the special effects, are merely satisfactory, with even Wayans looking surprisingly comfortable in a significant role.  While this is nothing to throw on the tag line, rest assured that everyone really does pull their weight in GI Joe.  Still, there's certainly an air of obsolescence to Joe that is ultimately its biggest issue.  Aside from fleeting moments of nostalgia that only a handful of audiences will experience, this is a movie that just has no real identity.
B005IZLPMY|3.0|I found this movie to be a complete waste of an afternoon and $19.99. I was highly anticipating this to be a good well thought out action movie but it fell way short of my expectations. I also expected the Blu-ray visuals and special effects to be great but... not so much. This movie is just barely OK but I definitely wouldn't put it on my movies to buy list at least not until it hits the $5.00 bin.
B002ZG97RE|3.0|It's three years behind being considered \\"timely\\", yes; certainly, you may have heard this from a plethora of critics.  I resent that.  This event in our country's history is so pivotal, so controversial, that it must be repeated over and over until even the most fickle and inattentive of individuals consider it a tedious act.  It's the only way to deny the next history books any wriggle room for unwarranted subjectivity.   Keeping that in mind, only some will find Greengrass's new thriller intriguing, let alone enthralling.  It may be my, as of yet, lack of mental saturation to the middle eastern debacle which sets me firmly in that alternative minority.    Regardless, it's hardly a love-it-or-hate-it film; this new episode in the Greengrass/Damon saga puts itself at the mercy of audience preconceptions of the second Gulf War, and many of you will ultimately consider it unnecessary.  But, again, I ask:  Is it engrained in you yet?  Well, Greengrass takes steps to achieve just that, taking few risks in a territory treaded by superior predecessors...one of which just recently bringing home a statue.  It's ultimate strengths and flaws are meshed together to make for a fleeting mediocrity that it never quite escapes; after all, despite everything going against it, this is a film with components of undeniably immense talent, and the tried-and-true subject matter is no excuse for its lack of more consistent effort, if not its ability to be extraordinary.    but the real bummer comes from the incompetence and illogical fallacies that accompany \\"Green Zone\\"'s otherwise capable tale of deception.  For every thorn of intrigue, there is an amateurish action to offset its credibility, and it goes a long way to preventing the audience from being engrossed.  That said, it's certainly not without its thrills, and that much is achieved by the steadfast chemistry that Damon and Greengrass seem to share, as well as a strong supporting cast.  Isaacs, the longtime british shoe-in forthe gruff, villainous types, is uncannily comfortable playing an American special forces member.  Damon, already proving himself as an easy go-to man for a leading role, is solid but unexceptional - something that I feel may become an unfortunate staplepoint in his immediate career should he not seek out for unconventional roles.  Finally, Gleeson and Kinnear play off of one another perfectly, and I really do wish that more screen time had been given to the two of them.  I feel that I need to reiterate my warning to those who are looking for game-changing insight into what is quickly becoming apart of our history, despite the fact that men and women around the world are being affected by it every day.  Keep in mind that many of the questions Green Zone brings up may have already been answered; or, if they haven't by now, then they're apparently not important enough to the masses to be worth considering.  A cynical view, but one I consider sadly accurate.  But whatever; keep that in mind, and avoid the headlines telling you what's old news, and this very unpunctual thriller may grab you.

B002ZG994U|3.0|Listen to this:  A-Team is smart, and there's not a damn thing ya'll can do about it.<br /><br />Well, when it wants to be, anyway.  Being the product of a time in television when the term \\"cheese\\" was still limited to a dairy product, there's a rare dilemma that director Carnahan was left with:  How much cheese is too much cheese in this day and age?  It's a legitimate inquiry in the face of a fan base that would likely want loyalty to the source material, above all else.<br /><br />Here lies the search for an equilibrium that most directors have the benefit of ignoring for the majority of their career; you'll see people working with extremities, certainly, but nobody has the gull to ask for the best of both worlds when the budget and the namesake are on the line.  Here, both are susceptible to permanent damage if the right balance ISN'T found.<br /><br />Fortunately, Carnahan gets it right, and with no credence to his track list as a director.  It's a welcome surprise.  Your disbelief is politely asked to be suspended, and that may irk some who have settled into the standards of contemporary cinema, but the charm will win you over.  For those that know better than to walk in with any concept of accuracy in physics and life probabilities, you'll be much more satisfied.<br /><br />But the important factor to understand, here, is that it has enough to appeal to each party, and that's something to be proud of.  The wit only goes on to act as bonus filler for a movie that already knows its place and itself.  That's not to say that the intelligent script shouldn't be lauded, because it certainly should.  Everyone participates in a real bite that every summer movie strives to have, and it goes a long way towards tricking us into thinking that every dynamic plan that Alpha concocts is smarter than it actually is.<br /><br />Moves to make a friendly cast were pivotal in keeping all of this broad-range appeal in check, and this is where the producers hit a home run.  Although veteran Neeson seems like a slightly too obvious choice for Hannibal, the rest of the cast joins in to encompass something of a peculiar mob of tier 2 actors that intrigue at face-value.  It really comes together on the screen, with Cooper, Jackson, and Copley making names for themselves almost immediately.  Jackson definitely had the most to prove, here, and I can only hope that this performance will be enough to write off \\"Rampage\\" from his acting resume'.<br /><br />However, the show stealer award belongs to Wilson, who's sardonic, insidious humor in conjunction with his role as the overconfident, screwy CIA agent makes him the perfect antagonist to build off of.<br /><br />It all forms to make the A-Team hard to deny, for it is genuine.  There are no tricks or flair associated with this movie, and its honesty should be appreciated.  Humility is easy to underrate, but make no mistake, it's difficult to come by in blockbusters as of late.ous choice for Hannibal, the rest of the cast joins in to encompass something of a peculiar mob of tier 2 actors that intrigue at face-value.

B0061JPYX2|4.0|Posthumous albums usually have a quality much lower than that of those late artists' best work (witness \\"Michael\\" by Michael Jackson, for example), but Amy Winehouse is a different story. In fact, she put out only one great and instant classic album, \\"Back to Black\\" (2006).  The \\"Lioness\\" offering, coming less than five months after her untimely death, brings nothing in terms of shockingly good revelations or revolutionary performances - yet, her incredible musicianship is fully on display. The collection includes rarities and shelved songs which, still, would fit nicely even on Back to Black - mostly pop/soul tunes, often with reggae hues.  What proves that Winehouse was truly one of a kind, is the fact that the best cuts here are standard songs - from the classic \\"Girl from Ipanema\\", through Carole King's \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?\\" to the excellent, maybe definitive remake of \\"Half Time\\". Also included is a version of another of her signature tunes, \\"Valerie\\", as well as the recent Tony Bennett duet on the seminal \\"Body and Soul\\", chronologically the last official recording Amy did.
B001GCUNWQ|3.0|Given the uninspired nature of it's predecessor, one would be surprised to discover how delightfully solid Ice Age's third (and, hopefully, final) \\"dawn\\" really is.    Although the number of prominent characters crowds the film, often resulting in a depressingly slow crawl as the directors attempt to keep screen time balanced, the film, as a whole, is undoubtedly a more realized product that enjoys it's new reptilian elements.  Simon Pegg is a surprisingly wise addition to the family, delivering the most consistency in terms of humor.  The old trio, consequently, takes a backseat to the new stars, sadly being of little significance in the overall plot and it's eventual resolution.  Still, the animation is satisfying, even in the wake of Pixar's \\"UP\\" and the primordial squirrel scenarios are as hilarious as ever.

B003UYUQZW|2.0|While I was watching Newell's Persia, the only thing that constantly reminded me of this film's video game roots actually had nothing to do with the aesthetics themselves.    More on that later.  It needs to be declared, however, that Newell is quite possibly the first director to \\"trick\\" an ignorant audience out of playing their hand and avoiding video game adaptions like it had the word \\"Bubonic\\" in its title.  I mean, my grandparents were anticipating this movie.  This simply could not be echoed for previous entries into this misguided and struggling genre.  That's the power of Bruckheimer and Disney at it's finest, folks.  But, is it really a turnaround that will pave the way for future video games to hit the big screen?  Again, it needs to be reiterated that this feels nothing like its source material, and that wasn't a mistake, I assure you.  Basically, Disney has been the one to step up to the plate and crush the hearts of purists by using their actions to say, \\"this movie is owes itself to a game, but damned if we'll tell the rest of the world if we want it to make money.\\"  And, if first-day results are of any indication (and they always are with the producers), it worked.  It's just too bad that they couldn't make it any better than its predecessors.  The prince fails just about as painfully as any other video game adaptation, but for very different reasons.  The production values are there, more than ever.  The talent is there, and they work with it.  The action is there, and that was never really an issue to begin with?  So, what's the problem?  What isn't there?  Well, everything else, essentially.    The Persia franchise was never really much for a story.  Rather, it instead took the hearts of high-brow critics (who know, those looking for a story in video games) by having a terrific script and committed voice actors.  That stands as something genuinely unique and bullet-worthy for a game.  In a movie, they're generally prerequisites.  Alas, that's notto say that this movie even HAS a decent script, because it really doesn't, and that comes through with an editing process that goes all kinds of tweako.  Those who have kept up with me will know of my affection for a movie with a good rhythm; a good PACE.  Persia has about as much rhythm as an individual has intelligence for believing that airplanes in the night sky are shooting stars.  Its erratic formula pushes the audience further and further away, leaving us so flabbergasted midway through that the action sequences are a welcome brain funk.  Speaking of which, they also suffer from an over-enthusiastic party of editors, but it's ultimately offset by the enjoyable tug-o-war between a set of protagonists and antagonists that mesh well together.  The Hassansins, a bit like pseduo desert nazgul, are especially enjoyable to watch.  Unfortunately, they can't stay on the screen forever, and as far as chemistry goes, that which lies between Dastan (Gyllenhaal) and Tamina (the increasingly more beautiful Arterton) is about as consistent as....well, the editing (that's the last time I'll bring it up).  The movie itself is in dire need of a standout peformance; Molina was obviously designed to be the crowd pleaser, and he undoubtedly has his moments but, really, no one takes center stage, and it's a problem.  So, no, Disney has not yet discovered the formula for creating a cash cow out of a video game adaptation.  They've simply sidestepped all of it and a movie that is, in its own right, not very good and, from a gamer's standpoint, still not very good.  I can see future articles claiming that this will be seen as a stepping stone towards an revolution in the sub-genre, but don't be fooled and, honestly, I'd settle with advising that you not go see this movie, aside from proving the theory that Arterton seemingly gets more attractive as the months roll by.

The only thing i have a complaint about so far is what the hell is gonna happen at the end?? Only one chapter of Jaime and the way it ends owww noooo please don't go.  Great Book no doubt in my mind just hurry along with the 6th installment George! I see all the complaints and I think one problem is that people have read these books years apart, I have had the luxury to read all 5 in the past 8 months, which i think has made it all the better....
B003Y5H5FG|3.0|Well, we certainly love our spunky reboots these days. J.J. Abrams perfected the formula with Star Trek, and Matthew Vaughn followed suit, adopting a very similar tone with X Men: First Class. These are electric, exuberant reboots which exude youth and gloss. Fright Night, in theory, only manages to snuggle alongside two of these other films on a loose basis. But it's not until proper viewing that it becomes clear that all of these films are built upon very similar foundations; they may not be neighbors, but they certainly share the same suburban neighborhood.   Well, fair enough. I can dig this new scene, if only for the fact that its approach has resulted in a provocative, acceptably tense vampire movie that respects the lore and retains the sex symbol attractions without adhering to Twilight's rules. A little bit of this has to do with Gillespie's brash directing, but the rest of the charm owes itself to Colin Ferrell, who seems despicably confident in a role like this. His hip, lax attitude is a refreshing take on the everyday vampire; there's not a drop of teenage angst to be found, here, folks, and that even applies to the rest of the cast.   Upcomer Yelchin shows range as the cry wolf kid who takes vampire killing matters into his own hands, Poots (what an unfortunate last name) who was encouraging in her past role in 28 Weeks later, doesn't disappoint, and Mintz-Plasse is Mintz-Plasse. The surprising inclusion of David Tennant is an odd choice that almost pays off, but his pompous, pseudo Russel Brand tendencies seem out of place before the credits start to role. For all of its style and humor, the suspense often feels like the black sheep stuck on the outside. Gillespie is clearly eager to get to the money shots, with hardly fifteen minutes going by before Jerry claims his first victim on the big screen.   It works for its strong moments of intensity but, for what it's worth, this is a giddy date movie if there ever was one, and you'll do well to find yourscares elsewhere. I was initially hard pressed in justifying a remake for a film that so fully embodies the term \\"cult classic\\", to the point where, I'd suspect, at least half of the audience thought of this as a standalone. But it's difficult to argue with things done right, even if they don't stay true to their roots. The original Fright Night is a self-conscious classic that undoubtedly inspired the likes of \\"Scream\\". All that Gillespie's new take will likely recall is a thankful - if forgettable - alternative to the vampire scene of present, but if anything' worth your time anymore, it's something new.

B005IZLPKQ|3.0|It's harder than you would think to make an action adventure film based on the pulp simplicity of the old timers. More so now than ever before, action films have drawn upon each other from years - even months - past, all for the sake of placing a stake in present ideologies and notions of what these specific movies are meant to represent. It's limiting, but it can usually mean a quick buck or two for those limited directors who put a bit of effort into creating something moderately intriguing.   And then, we have Captain America. Before I could begin to study an odd, nostalgic throwback into the very recent voids of American cinema, Joe Johnston did it for me. Joe Johnston's interpretation of Marvel's sanctuary isn't modern; it's hardly memorable. That said, if Captain America: The First Avenger is anything, it isn't nauseously replicated by experiences months past. It is retro, such is the word that is used so seldom. There are things that a CGI unit can do to evoke such an effect: Grain filters, washed out colors, light blooming; that said, it doesn't necessarily work under the circumstances that most modern films are granted - or, perhaps, burdened - with. Johnston has an eye for these intangibles, not the least of which is dedicated to his work on both the Mummy and the Rocketeer, two completely safe and secure action films which helped to epitomize the 90's before bullet time dominated the scene.   It is wholly pulp, characeristically old fashioned, and almost painfully short sighted, but that's where all of the charm seems to lie, anyway. More than anything, Chris Evans' work needs to be applauded. Drawing his own line between insecure empathy and a hoax patriotism of sorts, Evans works well with a role which would be seemingly inflexible, allowing the audience to witness a progression of maturity from what is, perhaps, the most iconic superhero of all. There really isn't much else to say about the performances: Weaving is a hopelessly evil sociopath with superhuman tendencies, Tommy Lee Jones offers some comic relief, and there's a love interest. As far as situational awareness presents itself, these are the basics.   Plenty of this is complemented by a massive, exuberant atmosphere which evokes the majesty of the American 40's extremely well. This is most definitely where Johnston and company shine, and it's no surprise, given his extensive track record. Buildings are massive, explosions are pretty, and people die with dignity. It would be hard to call it anything other than pure family fodder if not for Evans' performance, which seems to be a vessel for others to observe and be inspired by. Chris Evans is a man who understands both the innocence and the responsibility of a \\"rising\\" Captain America, which is undeniably a vital component in establishing a proper atmosphere.   The imposing, impressive badass will come later; for now, Captain America is a man limited to his very clean and admirable philosophies, and it's as good a film as any to stem into Whedon's magnificent epic, \\"The Avengers!\\"
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I'm a huge Dr Who fan, and David Tennant is my hero. That said:<br /><br />This is the full size toy. Same size as in the movie. Some of the other ones on the net are the tiny 3\\" long basically keychain trinkets.<br /><br />It has ok sound for a toy replicating a movie, but it's not quite as cool as the movie sound. Still kinda cool<br /><br />This is of course made of cheap plastic, but the best you're going to get at this price. What were you expecting, metal? If you were going to use it as a prop when going to a sci-fi convention, I would dirty it up some to make it look aged and rugged, instead of shiny plastic. Maybe use some dye or paint effects on the nooks and crannies on the handle?<br /><br />The UV ink is invisible, and the light does illuminate it perfectly. Cool for kids I guess.
B0021L8V0M|2.0|Political thrillers aren't supposed to be boring.  Certainly, this applies to just about every genre in the industry (save for anything golf-related), but poli-thrillers have the benefit of being centered around an aspect of life that simply gets audiences riled up by defailt:  That is, the innards of modern day politics.  It's an active panic trigger of a concept that comes with no manual, simply because most directors and screenwriters know precisely what to do with it.    I don't really know where Phillip Noyce went wrong with Salt.  It could've been enticing enough to encourage me to keep guessing HOW it would end, as opposed to WHEN.  Unfortunately, there's something inherently wrong with this movie's methods of scheming us into believing that anything of importance is up its sleeves, when there simply isn't.  Salt's depth lies in Jolie, who flourished as an actress years ago and no one seems to have caught on quite yet.  Benefiting from her committed performance, it's easy to stare into the movie's murky premise and see something substantial, only to soon realize they were simple mirages that the writers likely acknowledged, but failed to incorporate into the story, as the film progresses onwards without them.    Salt denies any real association with the complexities of espionage and massive political struggles, instead choosing to be kinetic and action-oriented, at the expense of being predictable.  It's a common trade-off, attempting to compensate for banality with the talent of their choreographers and intricate wire work, and it usually works.    Trouble is, Salt's uninspired nature is a disease that seems to have seeped into every aspect of the film, and Angelina isn't dynamic enough to save everything.  Chase scenes revolve around jumping aimlessly from one vehicle to another in identical fashion, and the fight sequences are tame and brief.    Everything about Salt seems to be determined to deny itself release from mediocrity; truth be told, there is potential here.  What could have been a half-decent Bourne clone is instead limited in scope, bland in visual richness, and dependent upon the charisma of Jolie, who cannot seem to encourage her supporting cast to follow in her wake, and it's not like Jolie is alone in the dark with amateur performers, either.  Again, however, Salt emits an air of humility and embarrassing lack of faith in itself and its underlying themes, and it just makes the whole movie feel sickly.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|When my kids who are at college referred to this game multiple times, I decided to purchase it just in time for Thanksgiving break.  We're all thankful I did!

B002T9H2LA|4.0|Subsequent to Tarantino's Kill Bill installments, I grew decidedly weary of his very familiar style that he had adopted and formatted to fit snugly into each and every project he may tackle.  Through elegantly crafted dialogue interplay and anxious cinematography and musical scores, the sharp flavor that is strictly Tarantino's own seems to have overstayed its welcome - for me, at least.   To declare that Tarantino needs to step out of his element is both irresponsible and unfair; does this oddball visionary really have an element to stray away from?  It's difficult to tell anymore.  But, if I were to encourage Tarantino to give himself a cinematic challenge and shoot for something more earthy and comfortable for his audience to digest, Inglourious Basterds isn't a bad start.  Smart, unconventional, and more restrained than Tarantino's previous films, Basterds a satisfying watch for anyone with a respect for superlative acting talent and thoughtful direction.  Pitt and Waltz, especially, are a joy to watch, each adding their own layers of harmless humor and charm to a movie that could have very easily taken itself too seriously.  Action takes a back seat to balanced dialogue exchange that is, thankfully, less digressive than what one would expect from Tarantino.  That said, the film's imagination is spread much too thin over a chubby 2 1/2 hour tale, and the anxiety leading up to an uneventful climax feels like a sucker punch.  Despite this, there's little to complain about throughout the majority of the film, and Tarantino takes enough risks to complement the admirably original absurdity of the subject matter.  Just don't expect to be seduced by white-knuckle action and tense confrontations.

B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I once wrote a short story set around a night in Paris. It was brief, whispful, and altogether gleefully fun to write, despite it (perhaps aptly) breezy, simple nature. Having never been a devout follower of Woody Allen, people I knew were still keen on telling me that his newest project in his fascinatingly schismed filmmaking career was something that would speak to me. Even after having watched the film, I still do not quite know what to make of it but, if the quality of \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is of any indication, I'll be flattered and take it as a compliment.   Paris stands tall alongside New York as, perhaps, the most beloved city in the world. Seemingly catering to a man who has seen the rest of the world overcomplicate itself with the fallacies of a wholesome life, Allen paints the city as, quite literally, an escape from the more perplexing realities. Our naive and excitable writer protagonist, played by who appears to be an equally thrilled Owen Wilson, ventures throughout Paris' many different delights throughout the ages, meeting his historical icons and other prominent figures of the many artistic mediums. It sounds bizarre and ambiguous, but take it at face-value; this film bends reality, but to say anything more would be to spoil an otherwise remarkably exhilarating twist, at least to those who appreciate cameo appearances. Do yourself a favor and walk into this movie with a bat's blindness.   One cannot help to echo the thrills that Owen Wilson's character feels during his midnight journeys, even if Allen's obvious love affair with the city is not one that we, as an audience, can replicate. Still, he does a good job of giving us a taste of said affection. \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is an earnest love letter to everything that thrives upon human passion: Writing, painting, dancing, singing - Art. Love. They slip in and out of one another's arms, these things. Allen does this with such clear and innocent giddiness that, initially, he teeters on one-dimensional themes and characters.   Truth be told, outside of Gil, what you see is what you get, but Allen cleverly uses his unusual concept to deliver timely messages about life and one's complacency within it. It's hardly the likes of Kubrik-esque depth, but it stays with you. It's so very hard to expound upon any one detail with a film like this, as to do so would be detrimental to the experience of someone viewing it for the first time. The tale requires the audience to share the spirit of discovery with Gil. Do this, and the appreciation of this gem of a city isn't even mandatory. It is a bonus, of course.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|I was introduced to he music of these guys in the movie \\"Once\\" and I find all the songs I enjoyed most from that soundtrack plus a few new complementary gems hidden in this album. I am so glad I added this to my collection.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|The era of the looney is over - Pixar made sure of this.  As much as I love them, the studio behind that little lamp has, for better or for worse, turned the concept of cartoons on its head since their arrival.  Ultimately, it was a successful evolution, but not without its share of unfortunate sacrifices.    Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud are aware of this and, perhaps with an air of contempt for their admittedly ingenious superiors, have attempted to incorporate the best of both worlds.  Despicable Me is the result of the experiment, and I am so relieved to say that it is a successful one.  A true labor of love, Renaud and Coffin's baby feels immediately retro in the best of ways, while still maintaining a commitment to the thematic elements that adults will appreciate.  That said, this is a goofy movie, plain and simple, and it's all the better for it.  It's easy to take the concept for granted:  Two villains struggling for relevance.  Don't be so quick to write it off, for it is nothing if not purely original, even though the idea has likely been skirted around in the past.  Clearly paying homage to the now barren wasteland that was once the world of the Looney Toons, Despicable Me is, perhaps, the greatest animated film of the last five years that strictly finds its charm in stark exaggerations.  That's, admittedly, a bit of an obscure thing to wrap your head around, but it will come together while you're watching - and you do owe it to yourself to see this movie, if only to witness one of the most adorable trios of children yet seen in cinema.  Renaud and Coffin put together an odd horde of diverse and talented performers for their voice cast; between Wiig, Arnett, McBride, Andrews, Segel, and two almost unrecognizable accents in both Brand and Carell, it's a funky party, to be sure.  Carell's interpretation of just who Gru is (a strictly european, self conscious man of a watered-down kind of evil) certainly finds its footing early on, making for a bit of humor simply from listening to him speak for an extended period of time.    Brand continues to strengthen his track record with a decidedly awesome take on the haggard Dr. Nefario, a veteran villain past his prime and doing everything he can from keeping Gru in his own.  The kids are the real crowd pleasers, letting us all know that Pixar doesn't have a monopoly on the cute factor in animation, let alone the animation genre itself.  Despicable Me is a movie that transcends any issues that may come with what could have become a gimmick in the wrong hands.  In the wake of Toy Story 3 and the terrific How to Train Your Dragon, Renaud and Coffin's film likely wont be remembered a year from now.  However, that doesn't prevent it from being a great stopgap in a pretty cramped summer.

B005NFVZTM|4.0|Well, it's not like the alternative is necessarily working anymore.  And with that, I mean those lonely, awkward pre/sequels that crop up after the original trilogy comes to a close.  Hell, even this franchise was subject to it a few years ago with X men Origins:  Wolverine.  And all it took was one of the most affable and widely known actors at that time in Hugh Jackman to have it barely break even with its budget in the states.  The industry gets it:  They need fresh blood; rejuvenated passion.  A different perspective.  Luckily, they have all the freedom in the world whilst working with comic book universes, where we welcome the artistic diversification of our heroes and villains.  Re-imaginings, alternate realities...these can be the next steps in the evolutionary process of our beloved \\"remakes\\".  Notice that I didn't say, \\"mutation\\".  As if I were that tacky.  Director Vaughn's First Class could very well be the best yet of these new species of successors.  Completely sidestepping the clumsy mess left before it in Brett Ratner's \\"Last Stand\\" and Gavin Hood's inspired, albeit misguided \\"Wolverine Origins\\", First Class stands tall alongside the more earnest and stoic interpretations of Singer and company, when X Men hadn't quite been a one-man Logan show.    Contrasts and inconsistencies abound, however, prevent me from referring to it as any kind of true sequel.  It's something that devotees and casual audiences alike will need to understand before committing to the stylistic and uncharacteristically vintage atmosphere that Vaughn has framed for us to behold.  It's a lovely, dedicated homage to everything that was hip before disco raped and pillaged the world on a mirror dance floor.  The ability to convey that warm, anxious 60's feel in the face of imminent nuclear war (or, at least as far as I can imagine it, going into my early 20's) is something that Vaughn clearly took very seriously, and it goes a long way towards giving First Class an acute personality completely alien to its predecessors.  I can only hope that he does the same with the inevitable sequels, where Charles and his X men face the trials of humanity as it struggles through Vietnam's, Berlin Walls, and Gulf Wars.  Vaughn had created a staple point in being conscious of the era surrounding the X men; he can't retreat now.  Speaking of X Men:  Although I can claim to consider them my favorite ensemble in a rich world of comic book heroes, my devotion is limited by a few dozen readings of one of their later iterations (The \\"Uncanny\\" series) and a fascination with the awesome, awesome cartoon series of the 1990's.  I needed to acknowledge to myself that some of the names here would be unbeknownst to me before now.    Even I can get some of the intermediates right:  Emma Frost, Havoc, Beast (before he was beastly).  And, yet, to be Sabastian Shaw under the performance of the ever classy Kevin Bacon not only showed me a villain whom I had not known of, it also struck me with a sudden rebirth of adoration for the franchise.  This doesn't feel like a coincidence; for many, First Class should feel like an embrace for fans - young and old - to come together for the first time and witness an entirely different landscape of the franchise.  The presence of Shaw was a rush; the presence of Charles and Erik was sentimental and nostalgic.   Speaking of making a presence:  McAvoy and Fassbender are compete dynamite here, almost solely elevating the film to completely new heights as their relationship forms, cracks, dishevels and, finally reaches a bittersweet equilibrium that we all knew was coming.  It's something that the two performers almost seemed born to do, and I can only hope that their dedication swings in other young talent for the inevitable sequels.    The other actors, not to mention the movie itself, follow in their wake, creating something that is feels adolescent and ambitious; still undeveloped, yes, but also brazen and distinct.  It's a firecracker of amovie, never taking itself too seriously, which was almost the downfall of the film adaptations to begin with.

B002ZG997C|3.0|It's truly sad to see films at odds with their own marketing departments.  You've seen it before; last year's exceptional \\"Adventureland\\" was one of the more recent casualties.  And, if my theory proves correct, The Hughes Bros.' \\"Eli\\" could be 2010's first.  It's a tragedy, to say the least as, judged under the merits it abides by, Eli is a thought-provoking, imaginative, and collectively disciplined action drama that's only a little pretentious.  It's not the next post-apocalyptic, action oriented crowd pleaser, nor was it really meant to be from the start.  Sure, there are artificial injections of action sequences that are quite good (especially one during the latter half that mushrooms into a spiraling shootout that is truly exciting), but they only act to needlessly complicate things.  As a result, the movie itself suffers severely from a real identity crisis, not appealing enough to any particular audience aside from those who respect a theme with heart, a stellar cast, and a realized vision.  The sparse wastelands that the Hughes siblings have presented to us may not be my favorite post-fallout world, but it's hard to not call it one of the more authentic and genuine yet seen in cinema.    Denzel Washington, having produced the film alongside veteran Silver, is solid, as always, who's performance nearly makes us forget how forgettably cut-out and tight-lipped his role requires him to be.  Gambon and company are satisfactory, and Kunis is decent as a more unconventional sidekick, but the real star here is Gary Oldman, who  has a special gift for getting the absolute best out of his villainous roles.  It's an impeccable fit, and he's a real joy to watch.  Another particular performer who I greatly admire makes an appearance, but I'll leave that for those who can catch him when he makes his screen entrance.  I know I'm not the only one who had expected to walk into this theatre assuming that my brain wouldn't be doing much more than twiddling his thumbs while myvisual senses would get an eye candy workout.  Truth be told, I cant help but feel gipped after coming to the realization that, yes, there was a story and a theme, and it really was worth paying attention to.  Ultimately, that's the fault of the marketing team and, to a lesser extent, screenwriter Gary Whitta, who's ambition couldn't quite translate onto paper.  That said, I can't blame anyone but myself for judging Eli's book by its seemingly flashy, hollow cover, only to find something actually meaningful within.

B002VKE1K2|4.0|Predictably, it seems that the industry has begun to awaken from its catatonic state of releasing stale gore-fests in mechanical fashion; truth be told, it would take an indie director to make the ambitious leap.   Rocketed by a steady stream of justified internet hype, Oren Peli's \\"Paranormal Activity\\" lives up to its name as a genuinely disturbing piece of minimalist cinema, and it's a real crowd pleaser, to boot.    The story is deceptively typical, centering around a couple coping with ghostly events that slowly escalate in both violence and the \\"intimacy\\" it has with its victims.  The documentary-style film chronicles approximately three weeks of trauma, until finally coming to a resolution that leaves the audience shaken, albeit hardly surprised.  Although some, or even many, will be discouraged by the leisurely pace at which the film limits itself to, it ultimately should be appreciated, as the slow buildup in tension eventually leaves the audience breathless with anticipation.  Although they are growing increasingly more commonplace in the new age industry, I feel obligated to warn cinema traditionalists that yes, this is shot adhering to the Blair Witch style of film making, and yes, you will be left struggling more with what your imagination can conjure up than what the movie presents to you; the latter, fortunately, is something that only the most keen thriller director's can craft with expertise, and Peli does so marvelously.    Not to be dismissed is the acting talent:  Two no-name performers that commit to their roles so smoothly that it is easy to overlook them.  The casual humor and trivial banter that the two bring to the table is both charming and credible; their bond will certainly reach you, and it strengthens the emotional impact of each event that they find themselves in.  To say that this is one of the most terrifying films in recent history is no real stretch but, alas, its competition is growing increasingly more pitiful.  With that said, its vital that we recognize the few gems of talent that gradually arise from the masses of mediocrity, and I am pleased to say tat Peli's \\"Paranormal Activity\\" is the next diamond in the rough.

If you have a vinyl to mp3 converter then this problem isn't insurmountable, but if you don't have a vinyl converter this is still something to listen to over and over.

B002PMV9FG|4.0|Those who know me may be inclined to say that I'm not one who's really in a position to review anything associated with Harry Potter, not the least of which being his sixth installment.    I do acknowledge that my indifference for the franchise has flourished in an age dominated by movies that I believe pay more respect to the fantasy realms.  You may understand me, then, when I say that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is one of the best films I've reviewed all year, and speaks for itself as a testament to the non-believers like myself that such a late film in the saga has driven me into humble conversion.  Those behind the scenes have finally figured out how to bring the people to the center of attention, as opposed to the magic.  And, ironically, you feel that this is the way it was supposed to have been all along.  The magic is still there; it's in the delightfully comfortable actors and actresses, many of which have come to form elegantly and beautifully.    And elegance is certainly the name of the game, here.  Everything about this film emits a sophisticated, casual eloquence to it that is much easier to appreciate than the anxiety and disjointed flash atmosphere that seemed to coalesce in the past films when there was an intermission between significant events.  Novice David Yates was patient this time around, and it paid off in spades.  Predictably, the Harry Potter universe is getting increasingly more crowded, and it would prove difficult for anyone to keep screen time balanced.  Yates does this with as much precision as one could, all things considered, but it is saddening to see some once-prominent characters now taking solace in the distant background, clearly obstructed by the charming trio, surprisingly solid Draco Malfoy (who just shines, especially considering his very minor roles in the past few installments) and the solemn Dumbledore.   The film is exempt of a great deal of action, and explosion enthusiasts may be turned off by such.  The effects play their part, though, complementing the performances instead of suffocating them, and are as striking as ever.  Ultimately, The Half Blood Prince has made me genuinely excited for what the end of times may hold for Harry and his friends, to the point where, even now, I cant help but feel a haunting and bittersweet twang of the heart that this epic journey is finally coming to an end.  Lord knows that, whatever happens, I'll be in line to witness all of it on day one and, come number seven, you should, too.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|This is a film that's very easy to be taken for granted, against all odds.  As conveniently simple as possible in its storytelling, yet still carrying more baggage that one would hope for, Blomkamp's directorial debut is slow to pick up steam.<br /><br />But when it does...oh, wow.<br /><br />District 9 is a freight train that somehow manages to creep up on you.  Its complex premise  is filled with incessant experimentation, with documentary-esque techniques used to set the gears in motion before resorting to more traditional cinema.  It may be a testament to the director that the transition is subtle enough to fall to the wayside amidst both the exhilarating action and impeccable performance by newcomer Sharlto Copley.<br /><br />In fact, Copley's performance must be emphasized:  The radical trials that his character undergoes throughout the movie would be a difficult balancing act in the hands of any experienced actor; somehow, Copley maintains authenticity and a commitment to character that is both astonishing and emotionally crippling.<br /><br />Even more impressive is Copley's acting debut when one is made aware of his most prominent co-star:  Christopher, a keen and determined insectoid alien.  Drawing from the film's graciously veiled root themes, Blomkamp's aliens are both repulsive and oddly intriguing.  Their tribulations are made clear early on, but careful crafting is done to ensure that the audience feels deep sympathy for the prawn-like organisms by the time the credits roll.<br /><br />This is accomplished, in part, by Peter Jackson and his digital effects company, WETA.  Adhering to a $30 million budget, one wouldn't suspect that District 9 would hold the crown for the best special effects of the summer.  Alas, this proves to be the case as the film moves forward, using its stunning, yet conservative flair to complement the film, as opposed to overbear it.  Jackson and his team are masters of the visual arts, and it definitely shows here.<br /><br />Let it be clear that District 9 is less of a retelling of a story, and more of a recording of an event; traditional plot features are often underdeveloped, or even wholly absent.

B002ZG977Y|2.0|It's hard to be the best.  Sometimes it's easy to get caught up in the challenges that await you, and you attempt something that you weren't quite ready for.    Now, I like Leterrier.  And there's really no reason to believe that he would struggle with a remake such as this.  But, then again, I also wasn't under the impression that he would get caught up in the challenges laid down by previous superlative blockbusters.  Sometimes you just need to consider the source material you're working with and succumb to the innocent mindlessness of it all.  Well, here we are.  And forgive me if I sound naive, but the strongest gripe I have with this modern re-imagining of the 80's cult classic is its inability to know its place in the tier pyramid of summer blockbusters.  Ask yourself if you want drama in your greek mythology.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  Now, ask yourself the last time the two were successfully coupled since the days of Homer.  I never wanted drama with my Titans.  It ranks alongside cyborgs as the one thing that, I believe, can and should be devoid of sincere drama in order to attain its highest potential lest you steal screen-time from the very necessary beast slaying.  Well, there lies the profound issue with Leterrier's priorities.  You'd be hard-pressed to find anything truly satisfying with this film, given what it promises. It's a devoutly crafted salute to an unlikely cult classic, but there's truly nothing compelling about...well, anything.  It's disappointing, considering the infinite scope of the source material.  I'm a sucker for Greek lore.   There does seem to be something very incomplete about what is shown here.  A sequel - or, dare I say, a trilogy - is almost guaranteed.  I can't deny that I'm willing to give Leterrier and crew a second chance, given what's available.  But until then...you've got a long way to go, baby.  Worthington gives the most uninspired performance I've yet seen by him, and just about everyone else seems to follow suit.  Again,I must reiterate how transparent the supposed drama here really is.  No real standouts exist, here.  It goes a long way towards making every scene a potential bore.  So, again I say, here we are.  Left with the scattered bones of a sad concept looking for a future.  Will it find just that in the sequels?  I'd like to think so.  But, until then, most may want to save themselves the time and money; go read the Odyssey.
