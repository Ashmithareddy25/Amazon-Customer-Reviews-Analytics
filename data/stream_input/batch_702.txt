B000NVIGC0|2.0|this is a very slow, dull album.  the kinda thing that you may expect from james taylor or something similarly lame.  this band is too good to be so tepid.  save your $.
B000ROALCG|2.0|Hector Lavoe is was a great star.  His music is amazing and still lives today.  The movie and the soundtrack does not do it justice.  If you really want to hear the flavor, soul and emotion of Hector Lavoe, please buy Hector Lavoe's CD's.  This movie and soundtrack is a terrible imitation.  Unfortunately the movie portrays only the bad side and does not get the flavor of a great singer.
B000000ZGO|5.0|Isaac Hayes is an interesting figure: a household name that is nonetheless misunderstood. Ask the person on the street if they know anything about Ike, and you'll probably get one of four answers: either \\"Oh yeah, he's Chef on South Park\\", \\"Oh yeah, he did the soundtrack to Shaft\\", \\"Oh yeah, he wrote songs for Sam & Dave\\", or maybe, just maybe, \\"Oh yeah, he radically reinterpreted pop hits in an epic funky format and added some equally epic, equally funky songs of his own\\". That's exactly what he does on this album, probably his most famous solo disc other than the Shaft soundtrack. I've never been a Bacharach fan, but Ike's slow, silky cover of \\"Walk on By\\" far outdoes the Dionne Warwick version: listen to the way he balances those strings, saxes and heavy guitars and tell me it wasn't an inspiration for Norman Whitfield's similar efforts with the Temptations. Only this is as good as or better than similar efforts by that group. Then he gives us the perfect opposite of that with the extended funk groove of \\"Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquidalimystic\\", a funk-jazz masterwork with exquisite guitar and piano solos, unstoppable groove, and a title that no doubt inspired several of George Clinton's wackiest. This also contains his controversial reading of \\"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\\", with an infamous monolog that in truth gets a bit old, but thankfully ends just as it starts to get annoying: when it actually starts, it's a soulful cover of an overrecorded song: the orchestral arrangements are captivating as usual, and the occasional horn blasts add flavor when needed. The organ part sounds amazing, too. \\"One Woman\\" is overdone and uninteresting, but this is a hell of an album still.
B00005JMAH|4.0|While I think Azkaban has som excellent qualities to it that make it a fair addition to the movie series, it does have several flaws.    I'll start off with its virtues:    As mentioned in several reviews, Columbus needed to go in this more coming-of-age story and Cuaron delivers having come from doing Y Tu Mama Tambien (Which I recommend). The castle couldn't have looked nicer for the setting of the story. The creature effects look terrific. When you see Harry riding Buckbeak over the lake, you can see the CG creature's reflection as clearly as the creation itself. Wonderful cinematography. A much darker tone that begins to illustrate what the audience should expect for movies 4 and 5. Thewlis and Oldman are perfect for there roles as Lupin and Black.You also have Williams' last hoorah in Harry Potter with a wonderfully medieval score. The story never really wavers despite some of the parts of the book that never took place. Fortunately, Cuaron's pace isn't as rushed as The Goblet of Fire, but is workable and gives the fans of the books something to enjoy still.    The only three negative things I have to say is that there were two parts that should not have been taken away. First was the discusion of Moony, Padfoot, Tonks and Wormtail and their relationship. Second, the whole purpose of the Patronus was taken away because Harry's real reason for learning the charm was to stop dementors while playing Quidditch. I would have liked to see the match where Harry scares Malfoy away with the Patronus. I am very personally against Gambon as Dumbledore because he lacks the charm that Dumbledore in the books has and what Sir Richard Harris brough to his performances. I would have preferred Sir Ian McKellen or someone else though I can't think who.
B000026I8U|4.0|Manu Chao has been a recent musical introduction for me. I had never even heard of him until I caught his performance at this year's Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. Having said that, I was so impressed by his live performance that I was compelled to buy any of his recorded work I could get my hands on. I am not one to make any of those statements lightly.    His music seems, to me anyway, to be absolutely phenominal because of its use of Spanish, French, English, and even Portuguese as the languages in which he sings fluently. Being a bit of a language fan myself, that could be one of the biggest draws for me to his music. I really did enjoy the style in which his music was played, though. It blends salsa, rock, reggae, and bongo music all into one rather seamlessly. It is really an experience to listen to it, whether live or recorded.    The main tracks that I would suggest listening to are \\"Clandestino,\\" \\"Desaparecido,\\" or \\"Welcome to Tijuana.\\" With those three songs, it is fairly easy to get a grasp for how the album will sound, though it does take a few unexpected turns. For example, \\"Bongo Bong\\" and \\"Je ne t'aime plus\\" both utilize the same melody and beat, merely with different lyrics in different languages.    All in all, I would say that if you are a fan of reggae, world music, or really any type of latin music (but especially salsa), it is a CD well worth your time. Manu Chao will deliver an excellent album for you.
0316010669|5.0|Not as gripping as Tipping Point, but Malcolm has a way with words and offers us a fascinating read in Blink. A nice breezy read like Eightstorm and obviously a lot more thicker.
B00006CJOY|5.0|I saw Radio Bemba Sound System perform with Manu Chao at Bonnaroo 2007, and was absolutely blown away by the quality of the music and the amount of fun I had at that show. Naturally, I was ecstatic to learn that they had put out a live recording. I bought this album at the same time I bought Manu Chao's solo album, \\"Clandestino.\\" The differences between these two albums are the pace of the music, the energy of the band, and the undisputed fact that tequila magically becomes \\"better\\" with this album.    While listening to the recording and catching the live show are certainly different, this will get your blood flowing. It is a fast-paced, non-stop party with trumpets, bongos, reggae styled guitar riffs that have been perfectly merged with salsa tempos, love songs to Tijuana, and an overwhelming feeling of just cutting loose and having fun. If you like Manu Chao, you may or may not enjoy Radio Bemba Sound System. The songs are the same, only far more energetic in a much faster time signature.    All in all, any fan of Manu Chao's \\"Clandestino\\" will find this a delightful treat. This album is the next best thing to seeing this band live, and will probably make you want to do just that.
B000Q6GXW2|2.0|I agree.  Don't you think they'd try and make a high profile HD disc actually work?  Mine froze half way through also and I had to flip to the standard side to finish it.  (Combo discs are the dumbest thing ever btw- I bet the Bluray version plays fine- I cant afford a player yet though).  I realize I'm running older firmware on the HD-A2 but I hate having to upgrade firmware to play new discs every month now.  The standard side, btw, upsampled is so good, it gives 85-90% of the HD quality. I paid $35 for something I could have got 90% of for like $16.  The amount of extras on it are quite good though and some are in HD as well.    Here's my issue with the HD that everyone raves about, be it HD or blu-ray.  This movie was shot in film/blue screen and then was processed so much digitally afterwards that you end up with a nice HD version of a digital \\"noisy\\" film.  Some scenes look absolutely amazing in HD but doesn't all the digital noise in people's faces and in the skin of people bug you?  It bugged me.  I know they made it grainy for the look but the transfer could have looked different.  So this HD disc has fantastic visuals but it is not the technically, best video quality on HD.       Re-review: Aug. 9, 2007.  Now that I've actually got the disc working better... I know why I like HD DVD better than Bluray (so far).  Don't comment to me about your format wars.  I don't care.  When I get the money, I'll buy a bluray machine too.  I'm actually down for more space on a disc becasue I'm a hi-fi guy (so Bluray would be the choice eventhough you really don't notice the difference on the same codecs used on a movie between the 2 formats) but I have to say the extra features on the HD DVD are more fun.  I just watched 300 again with the split screen feature that shows you the regular unprocessed footage along with the regular movie and it is very, very cool.  I liked it a lot.  So  now my new rating is....4 STARS....  The movie gets 4 stars because it's good but no Godfather or Shawshank.  But the HDDVD disc sets the bar for extras on a HD disc.  Very cool.
B000UNYJV8|5.0|This story, both beautiful and disturbing in it's messages and imagery, is about many different themes, all brilliantly woven together by British director, Shane Meadows.<br /><br />The themes cover Thatcherite England in the 80's, Skinheads (good and bad), racism, bullyism, and the loss of childhood innocence. The film is strongly influenced by Director Shane Meadows childhood experiences as a skinhead, both good and bad.<br /><br />The outline of the story is that a young \\"Shaun Fields\\"(played amazingly by newcomer Tomo Turgoose) lives in a small un-named Northern English town in 1983. \\"Shaun\\" has recently lost his father in the early stages of the Falklands War. On the last day of the school term before summer break \\"Shaun\\" is harassed over his choice of hippy-like clothing by several cooler kids.<br /><br />On his way home from school, Shaun chances upon a non-racist skinhead gang (which includes two Jamaican members), led by the charming and lanky \\"Woody\\" (played by the affable Joe Gilgun). \\"Shaun\\" immediately takes to \\"Woody\\" as a surrogate father figure and is soon admitted in to the gang. Admission means parties, a new girlfriend (Rosamund Hanson) a new haircut, a new Ben Sherman shirt, and a new pair of boots (purchased by his mother (Jo Hartley) in an extremely funny scene) as well as a whole new group of friends who treat Shaun as an equal.<br /><br />All seems well in this quiet English town until one incident changes all of their lives about midway through the film. This is the return of \\"Combo\\" (the electrifying Stephen Graham in his first major leading role) from 3 years in prison. \\"Combo\\" is the former leader of this gang and wastes no time trying to re-establish his dominance in a direct confrontation with \\"Woody\\". \\"Combo\\" has become a racist during his 3+ years in prison and views skinheads as the prefect front line soldiers in the National Front's (an extremely conservative political party) war to keep England for \\"Englishmen.\\"<br /><br />This confrontation with \\"Woody\\" soon splits the gang, some siding with \\"Combo\\", others with \\"Woody\\". \\"Shaun\\" is now forced to choose among father figures and the movie takes a decidedly chillier tone from it's lighthearted first half.<br /><br />The film is brilliant because all of Meadows characters are complicated and feel like real human beings. \\"Combo\\" even offers \\"Milky\\" (Andrew Shim), a black skinhead, the chance to join his gang because \\"Combo\\" views the immediate problem as the \\"Paki\\" (Pakistani) workers who have flooded his town in recent years, taking jobs and houses from Englishmen.<br /><br />It's the complexities such as this that make the characters (such as the Swastika tattooed Combo) so approachable and compelling to watch.<br /><br />Even Shaun still appears like an adorable little child as he dresses in an English Cromby coat to go \\"Paki Bashing\\" at the local store.<br /><br />The movie comes to what seems like an almost inevitable violent clash between two of the main characters that, despite its predictability, still jars the viewer, hopefully leaving you sickened. Shaun is then left to decide where his future lies.<br /><br />The movies story is set against the backdrop of the Falklands War, whose brutal images Meadows deftly juxtaposes against the current violent and desolate climate of 80's England. Meadows was, interestingly, granted full access to many war footage images that had never been released to the public previously.<br /><br />The film contains a fantastic soundtrack of early \\"skinhead reggae\\" tunes, including several songs by Toots and the Maytalls, including \\"54-46\\" which is played over a collage of media clips from 80's Britain and the Falklands War. It's a terrific mood setter for the rest of the film.<br /><br />Meadows shines so brightly (as does his cast) because he intimately knows this material and these characters, many of whom are based on or even named after childhood friends of his.<br /><br />Some American viewers may initially be off-put by the idea of any \\"Skinhead\\" related movie if all they know of skinheads is what they have seen in the American press in the last 20+ years. It may surprise many viewers not familiar with the original skinhead scene (circa 1966-72) in Britain to learn the the original skins (now often called Traditional Skins, Trojan Skins, or '69 skins) were a multi-racial bunch who were an off-shoot from the Mods. They were known, like the Mods, for being sharp dressers and they chose as their music Jamaican Rocksteady, Reggae, and American Soul. The skinhead movement in England largely died out in 1972 and then saw a revival in the late seventies. It's this revival group that was penetrated by the likes of the National Front that Meadows covers here. If you choose to not watch this film based on it's subject matter, you are missing not only one of the best acting performances by a new-comer(Turgoose)in recent history, but you are also missing what will no doubt become considered landmark moment in British film history.have seen in the American press in the last 20+ years.

B000JLQSWE|3.0|Well, I'm a long time Alan Parsons fan. I hadn't heard this album in a long time and had forgotten how weak in material it was in comparison to some of the Project's other work such as Tales of Mystery and Imagination, Turn of A Friendly Card, and I Robot. Still, it does have some great songs that I'll always enjoy, but I won't enjoy it as a complete work. The remastering is great. One can't complain about that. For the diehard fan, it is, of course, a must have. If you are not a diehard fan, you are better off just buying the 3 cd import collection.

B000002H33|5.0|I'm writing this review 17 years after this record was released and I'm writing with the same admiration and awe as when I first heard it. It has not gotten old or stale and if anything I appreciate it even more given the current sad state of affairs in the music buisness. This is a seminal hard rock/metal milestone. It ranks with the very best of the genre; including Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\", Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", Guns N Rose's \\"Appetite for Destruction\\", AC/DC's \\"Back in Black\\" and Led Zeppelin 4. It is a near flawless example of metal fused with melody and compelling song writing and musicianship.<br /><br />Best tracks: Battery, Disposable Heroes, Damage Inc, Sanitarium.
B00004UEDR|5.0|5 STARS RIGHT OFF!    Some films can be formulaic and their characters fairly predictable thus being the case in the 2000 film 28 DAYS starring Sandra Bullock.What makes this this film so appealing and so important is the correct balance with which Bullock handles her character, the alcoholic,pill addicted, made-a-mess-of-her-life (and everyone elses!)Gwen Cummings.With addiction ruining her life, Gwen enters a rehab for a mandatory 28 days after running a hijacked wedding limo into the living room of a house.She had previously made a complete fool of herself at her sister's wedding by falling backside into the three tiered wedding cake! Bullock allows Gwen to go through all of the stages of denial, regret and final acceptance of her disease with comedic touches and true pain showing both sides of addiction recovery as they are: the blunt reality that you have hit bottom and you may die, but on the other hand \\"Keep it simple stupid\\" and \\"Easy does it.One day at a time.\\" In other hands, this movie about such a serious and life threatening condition might become overly serious,preachy or maudlin; but director Betty Thomas trusts Bullock with the Susannah Grant screenplay to keep Gwen from becoming a joke OR a model of sobriety.    If I had to choose one film that treats addiction without depressing the viewer to no end, then it would be 28 DAYS. Other excellent films such as MY NAME IS JOE, CLEAN AND SOBER, FACTORY GIRL,RAY, AFFLICTION and even NUTS, although completely wonderful films in their own rights, are very heavy handed and can be quite depressing. 28 DAYS embraces the grave subject with a lighter touch that does not bring down the viewer.(REMEMBER: Movies can inform and STILL be entertaining!) The viewer is uplifted and given hope amidst the rocky road to recovery. This is a highly recommended movie on the subject of addiction whether you are an addict, a counselor, someone in 12-step recovery, or someone affected by an addicts behavior.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|As a whole, the new Smashing Pumpkins album rocks a little heavier than their previous works, as evidenced by the scorching opener \\"Doomsday Clock.\\" The first track is encouraging for longtime Pumpkin fans because it at least reminds us that this is one of the best musical acts of the last twenty years and any album they release will at least be above average.  Listening to the rest of the album, it becomes clear that few, if any, would call this their best record (I reserve that title for Mellon Collie...).  Depending on expectations, some might consider this album a disappointment, while most will be satisfied.  I consider myself part of the latter group, satisfied though not blown away.    One of the more notable tracks is \\"That's The Way (My Love Is),\\" a more uplifting departure from the rather dark tone that encompasses the rest of the album.  Those who have followed Billy Corgan's career will easily be able to categorize this song as one that could have fit well on a Zwan record.    \\"Tarantula,\\" the Pumpkins' comeback single, is a standout, complete with driving guitar solos and ferocious drumming from Jimmy Chamberlain.  \\"Starz\\" has that familiar SP feel to it, while \\"United States\\" serves as the sole epic, self-indulgent track of the record, clocking in at nearly 10 minutes.    \\"Neverlost\\" is the first track to shelve the guitar distortion for the most part while introducing the softer, second half of the album.  The band changes direction slightly with \\"Bring The Light,\\" the chorus featuring a soaring guitar hook over a driving beat.    \\"(Come On) Let's Go!\\" is a great straightforward rocker that would go over well in concert.      The album ends in a grand fashion, the way only the Smashing Pumpkins would end a rock record, with \\" Pomp and Circumstances.\\" It is possible that this album is one that will get better with more listens over a long period of time.  At the very least, it is a good album to listen to, and a welcome return to the music scene for the Smashing Pumpkins.
B00005OM5L|5.0|This is one of Eric's best DVD releases, an utterly inspired performance.  The blues rules and the master lays down some of his sweetest solos ever. The band is tight, the vocals are pure, the filming is better than most concert footage.  If you'll buy only one Clapton DVD, this would be it.

0142000655|3.0|I found this book to be fairly enjoyable and full of beautiful gems. I wrote down pages of quotes that I thought were worthy of being remembered. I reveled in many of Steinbeck's descriptions and elaborations. However, I do understand how many people could find this book obvious and simple.     To me it was an inspirational read much in the same way that the Bible can be moving. I took much value away from reading this novel because I began to look at it as an example of good and evil. A simplistic illustration that allowed the writer to voice his thoughts about life. This did not necessarily create a great turning point in literature, but I believe it did what it was intended to do; make the reader reflect.     I was not left with an overpowering thirst to run out and add this book to my collection but neither did I regret the time I had spent reading it. I would definitely recommend this book because I believe it is worth pushing through the boring parts to have the entire work to look back at and ponder. After all, over 100 of us had comments to share about it.       \\"Perhaps the best conversationalist in the world is the man who helps others to talk.\\"
B000ERU5EK|5.0|Not all of the tracks were exactly \\"trance,\\" like I expected from Above & Beyond and their other aliases. But with that said, the songs still give that entrancing effect and it's a really good album.
B000M341QO|4.0|I am Irish and I grew up in Boston. Whenever a movie is set in Boston, I simply cannot enjoy it if the accents are off -- it ruins the whole experience for me. Those of us who know the regional accents (and there are many) can be very harsh when sizing up those actors who attempt the local patois. Wahlberg and Damon are from Massachusetts, so they get a bye. Leo DiCaprio does an okay job; I understand that Wahlberg told him he'd be laughed off the screen if he didn't manage an appropriate accent. Jack Nicholson, though, is terrible! He kind of drifts in and out of his accent. There is also no way I bought him as an Irish crime boss. They are way more menacing and scary. Trust me.<br />Despite Nicholson's performance, though, I really enjoyed the movie. It is worth watching for the interplay between Wahlberg and Damon alone -- I got the feeling that Mark has always wanted to pop Matt and he gets to do it big-time here. Unlike some people, I loved the ending. It's all about retribution . . . the Irish never forget. And, we really do say \\"Sorry for your troubles\\" at wakes! Lots of nice touches like that made this an authentic enough portrayal of Boston. I subtracted one star for Nicholson, but overall I think Scorcese did a \\"wicked good\\" job.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The best detail and color of great subject matter I've seen ! This is a must buy. I have it in hd-dvd with a hd player and 65\\" hd tv and it is perfect. Adults and kids will sit in awe.. Make more like this please!
B000N4SHOE|4.0|I was on a flight from Hawaii to LA and \\"Miss Potter\\" was the movie that was shown. I had never heard of it, so I was amazed to see actors of such high calibre (Renee Zellweger & Ewan McGregor) starring in the movie. I wasn't expecting much, but I decided to watch it because hey, I was trapped on the plane. What a delightful surprise \\"Miss Potter\\" turned out to be! I had no idea that Beatrix Potter was so cool. Her story is that of an independent woman who believes in her creative talent so much that she goes against social convention (and her mother!) to pursue her dream of being published. All of the actors are wonderful, especially Emily Watson as her staunch friend and ally. I was also surprised to learn of Beatrix Potter's legacy to England. I subtracted one star because the first half of the movie is treacly sweet, but overall this is a great story and a little gem of a movie!
B0000259IF|1.0|I cannot believe Iggy Pop had the gall to completely trash this album (via his ill-done \\"remix/remaster\\").  He will go down in history as, man oh man, Amazon won't let me post words for it.  Other reviewers have sliced and diced the specifics better than I ever could, just let me say that this is NOT the same album that I listened to for years, on vinyl and CD, and that Iggy is a mega-jerk to label this \\"original\\" so that anyone looking for the *real* original will just find this charade.    The real, Bowie-produced original album, is for me one of the critical rock albums that will \\"change your life,\\" an incredible experience.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Pretty convenient for Al Gore if you buy his movie.  Since when did Al become an expert in climate change?  People who live in 5 glass mansions shouldn't throw stones.  This movie is nothing more than a scare tactic propaganda machine.  Don't believe the hype!  Don't believe the other reviewers who are convinced by this one sided liberal dvd. The earth gave us life and the earth can take it away when it has had enough of our excesses.  Call me silly or uninformed, but this movie is way over the top.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I just received, and viewed my copy of the movie on DVD. Daniel Craig is great as James Bond. This is a top flight Bond movie.      HOWEVER, the DVD I received is defective. It is impossible to turn off the subtitles, on the movie disk. The presence of subtitles is a language which I read is very distracting.  As I read both English and Spanish, the best solution was to select subtitles in French. I was then able to ignore the subtitles, and enjoy the movie. There is no problem with Disk 2, with the history of the Bond Girls.

And remember -these guys did not have the same level of sampling gear that we have today.  Sampling, back in 1988, involved a lot of analogue tape loops as digital sampling gear was severely limited and expensive.<br /><br />This is an IMPORTANT pop record that any serious music lover or musician of any ilk should own.  It is also charming and a wonderful record to give a youngster who is serious about music.<br /><br />Hell, I am a country musician and this LP blew my mind (I originally had it on vinyl).  What's weird is that so few kids into rap know anything about this seminal work.  It was out of print for a long time, but I wager that in 50 years it will still be in print.  That is the ultimate statement on quality.<br /><br />Ironically, I caught De La Soul live in Saint Louis in early June of 1989.  Weird, but they were dreadful. Live, they performed as a typical angry rap act where the lyrics could not be understood and the drum machine was deafening.  I was told Prince Paul was not part of the touring group, and I suspect that any quality De La Soul's recorded work is due to the efforts of Prince Paul.<br /><br />But then again, I caught The Police, U2 and the Pretenders in small clubs, and they were also horrid. U2 is still awful, but that is a mystery far beyond my meager literary talents.<br /><br />Anyway, Prince Paul is one clever, witty and tasteful writer. A serious record for serious musicans.
0143038419|4.0|I found this book impossible to put down. As a woman of exactly the same age as Gilbert (born in the same week as her), I had to fight my overwhelming feelings of jealousy towards her for her courage to do what she needed to do to be whole and healthy. I was jealous of her selfishness actually, and I did think she came across as terribly selfish at times (in the way that only childless people can be--sorry but it's true). But nonetheless the book offered powerful insights. Like Anne Lamott, another imperfect and slightly annoying writer, Gilbert is best when she is noticing and describing beautiful moments of grace and the ways in which God is present in our lives all the time if we only care to look. How so many of us lose the ability to appreciate that grace is a mystery, but this book is worthwhile if only as a reminder of the the grace is all around us and available to everyone. Come to think of it, any reminder that God does not only communicate with human beings through a somehow magically infallible book (the Bible) but also through flowers, friends, food, sex and wine is okay by me.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|This was one of the best thrillers to come along in a long time.  John Malcovich (a.k.a. Booth) is a wonderful villan in any setting, whether in a period costume drama or a modern day political drama.  A movie like this can deliver a great story with minimal violence and excessive swearing like a lot of their contemporaries (ex. the first three Die Hard movies), and deliver smart, witty dialogue along the way.    Clint Eastwood, still Dirty Harry after all these years, plays an aging Secret Service agent who is a little tired but an old pro at his job.  He is contacted by a man who claims he is about to shoot the president, and challenges him to not just find him but know him.  We soon discover that he is anything but a nutcase trying to get attention, he is a serious nutcase with a plan.  The assasin Booth tells him that he knows all about Eastwood's past, that he failed to protect JFK on that infamous day in Dallas, and he plans on repeating it.  In a rush to find him before it's too late, Eastwood and his partner attempt to find some kind of paper chase and shadow the president carefully, until he and Booth will inevitably cross paths and the final conflict will take place.    The only critical words I have for this movie are for the addition of Eastwood's parter, his situation was a little too obvious.  As a rookie, he was a family man who established his weaknesses early on in the story, and you just knew he wasn't going to survive.  And all those old photos of a young Eastwood in Dallas and Malcovich's past were a little too hoaky to be real.  Still, it was great suspense.
0143038419|3.0|I devoured the first half of Gilbert's book and added it to my favourites even before finishing it. Then, I got bogged down and frustrated with her total self-absorbtion. I felt that she contradicted herself for the purposes of an engaging story - was she inept and self-loathing or was she competant and self-loving?     This is a wonderful travel story that makes you want to pack up your life for a year and land at any random airport ill-prepared and curious - but that is all. Reading about how wonderful she is and how self-sacrificing she was toward herself, friends and new acquaintances left me feeling less than satisfied. In her book she writes that she is self-loathing and unworthy yet never stops telling us what amazing things others have to say about her and how she manages to save \\"everyone\\" while on the search for herself. Blech.     I give it three stars because of the wonderful glimpse into Italy, India and Indonesia - but just as the Countries are named...it is all \\"I...I...I\\".
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Don't get caught up in the format war hype. This HD-DVD is a winner with OUTSTANDING picture and sound. A full package of behind-the-scenes documentaries, interviews, games, downloads, and super cool blue-screen making of PIP mode with running commentary rounds out this package... Oh, and you can play the other side on a standard DVD player too.    Bottom Line is if you have HD-DVD... get this NOW! Great Movie! Great HD-DVD!    Enjoy!
B000RJO578|4.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost of the BBCs SPACED hit the genre nail on the head with their over\\"blown\\" cop buddy flick HOT FUZZ, with a stellar cast rounded out by Timothy Dalton, Jim Broadbent, and Edward Woodward to name a few, and a dead on screenplay that takes the long way around the obvious gag style jokes.  Nick Frost is affable and bumbling in his unique way and the while the movie starts to stretch on toward the finale this is done as an ode to all of those gloriously overwrought action movie endings.  Well thought out and executed this film should have done more at the BOX OFFICE hopefully it finds its following on the extras packed REG 1 DVD here in the states.  Solid entertainment \\"By the Power of Greyskull\\".
1400032717|4.0|I listened to it on CD, and I think the artistry of the reader enhanced my enjoyment of the book quite a lot. What I found compelling was trying to interpet the perceptions and thinking the autistic main character, 15 year old Christopher, in order to figure out what is really going on -- there is a mystery, all right, but not the one Christopher thinks. Although he is a mathmatical genius, he can't put two and two together to figure out that some things he has been told don't add up.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|In a musical industry that loves to pigeon-hole artists or put them into specific channels, there is not much incentive for a musician to blend styles, take chances, and come up with something totally new. Brandi Carlile was not dissuaded from coming up with something new anyway. She rocks, she sings ballads, and she does her own writing. She does not try to hide the country influence in her background, as her sweet lilting voice almost yodles at points. If you have eclectic tastes in music and enjoy a well crafted, soul touching song, you'll say what my girlfriend said after we listened to this disc the first time: Let's listen to it again.
0553588486|4.0|Normally, I do not  read fantasy novels, but a friend gave me this to read on a road trip. I was suprised to find myself enjoying it.  The book has excellent plotting, intriguing charachters, and is well written, things I don't normally associate with this genre (I realize there are probably some phenomenal fantasy novels out there, but they seem to be outnumbered by the dreck).  For some reason, most reviews I've read of this book seem to focus on the amount of profanity and sex; this took me aback somewhat, as I did not notice a remarkable amount of either.  Any modern crime novel (most modern literary fiction, for that matter) has far more.  I guess most fantasy must be filled with rainbows, unicorns, care bears, and happy endings.  This book has none of them, luckily.  I enjoyed the fact that even the \\"evil\\" characters are multi-faceted and complex, and that many of the \\"good guys\\" have dubious motives, lack backbone, or commit moral lapses. I can't wait to read the next one!
B000002UAO|5.0|More proof of the Beatles improving rock'n roll, and themselves once they went to the studios. Best group ever.
B00005OCMR|4.0|I was 11 years old when I first saw Tron at the theater. Wow! The big screen was definitely the way to go.    Back in 1982, this movie was THE cutting edge in special effects. Nothing else like it had ever been done before. I beleive that most of the naysayers of this film are of a younger generation that grew up watching movies where CGI effects were the norm rather than revolutionary.    Also, the \\"computer age\\" was just beginning to emerge from the hands of scientists and big corporations and into the hands of the common man. If you were around back then and old enough to understand what was going on, it was an exciting and scary time. No one really knew what was going to happen in our new \\"computerized\\" society, so there was a bit of apprehension and even a bit of paranoia when it came to these big, bulky machines that people were shelling out thousands of dollars for and setting them up in their living rooms and dens.    Tron addresses that apprehension and fear of the future. Of course, computers today are not scary at all and most people give no more thought to using their PC than one would give any extra thought to using a telephone or television. In that respect, Tron may seem dated and silly, but if you remember the computer revolution of the early '80s, Tron was a timely allegory of man's fear of losing control of his life to technology.    Ok. Enough of that.    This is a great DVD packed with LOADS of special features. I especially appreciated the \\"roots\\" of Tron and how the characters and ideas developed (as well as the special effects).    Give this movie a try if you're into early '80s nostalgia or if you're curious as to what the common man's outlook was like 25 years ago in regards to the future and technology.
B000002UAR|5.0|They talk @ the birth of rock'n roll, but the the Beatles matured rock,n roll and blew the doors wide open for all the varieties of the music field. No band can equal them, yet, if ever. To stop touring and going to the studios with the help of George Martin, and co., is shown from this LP on.
0061142026|3.0|I picked up this book, like many others, because I saw the movie preview.  When I can, I prefer to read the book before I see the movie.  Also, I had heard a lot about this author and was interested in checking him out.<br /><br />The book takes place in the town of Wall, England.  One evening Tristan Thorn is walking his \\"crush\\" Victoria Forrester home.  After being rebuffed Tristan asks \\"If I bring back that falling star, may I have anything my heart desires?\\"  Victoria, believing that Tristan won't act on this says \\"Sure\\".  The next day Tristan heads off through the gap into the magical world of Faerie on a search for the fallen star.  Thus the journey begins....<br /><br />I enjoyed the fairytale story and I thought that Tristan was a well developed character.  However, I would not classify this as an adult fairytale - rather I'd put it in the young adult/teenage section.  I felt the story could have been developed more and I was not overly impressed with Gaiman's writing style.  That said, I'd be interested to read more of his stuff and I certainly am still interested in seeing the movie.
B0000AOV85|5.0|The Beatles opened the doors for rock'n roll, but Pink Floyd went from an RnB band to Progressive rock. This LP is their Sgt. Peppers. There are not too many living legends as great as this group.
0060574216|1.0|John Gray's babble about the differences between men and women stinks up a storm, and it's best relegated to the field of pop psychology, not actual men-women relationships.    John's Ph.d is a fraud. If you don't believe me, then do an internet search on \\"John Gray phony Ph.d\\". You will get tons or articles pointing to the fact that he received his doctorate from the defunct university called Columbia Pacific University, which gave out degrees like they were going out of style for doing nothing.    It's not surprising that John Gray was as popular as he was in the 1990s decade. The yuppies seemed to flock to him like flies on fresh cow manure. But then again, yuppies have never been known as progressively-minded people. They flock to whatever trend is promoted by the media, like buying things you can't afford.     Hope this helps!
B000E6UK5K|5.0|It was a shame that Syd Barrett had to leave Pink Floyd, yet I don't think that the group would be near as large, great, nor talented without David Gilmour. He's not only one of the greatest guitarist on earth, but also a great living legend. I hope they all get together and tour, at least, one more time , like the Stones, or Paul McCartney.
B00005JPCF|1.0|First, this movie is boring.  Second, the music lyrics are not appropriate for children - unless sexual innuendo is what you deem appropriate for children.  Lastly, the move is anti-religious.  I am an atheist, yet I found the overt anti-religious message of this film to be a real turn off.  The films message is \\"don't believe in what your elders believe.  Don't trust your gods\\".
B000N4SADC|4.0|Hiromi keeps getting better with her live shows all the time, and her music overall is good.  This CD is a good listen, with no real highlights, but I didn't like it as much as her second CD, \\"Brain\\".  Whereas I could really enjoy \\"Brain\\" when I would listen to it, this one doesn't have me wanting to put it in the player again quite as quickly.
B000024RKB|3.0|\\" ALL THE BEST \\" actually is a 3 CD compilation of Bonnie's European only early 90's albums, with several of her late 70's RCA hits thrown in for good measure [ IT'S A HEARTACHE, LOST IN FRANCE, MORE THAN A LOVER, etc ]. I bought it for all the European only songs she recorded on 3 albums, & this set is a REAL bargain as you get almost all those album + singles tracks on this set. However, the quality of the songs & production I find not up to par with Bonnie's work for CBS/Sony in the 1980's .      It's hit or miss and take your pick with the songs here. The German label HANSA she signed with had her sing just about anything, with a lot of inferior written & produced songs. I like the songs Bonnie did with actual musicians like I CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, SAVE YOUR LOVE with Frankie Miller, WHERE WERE YOU, and others here. There are some good tracks with computer programming like RACE TO THE FIRE and BREAKOUT which both rock hard. Others have really drab computer backing & are just plain bad songs, like the atrocious SALLY COMES AROUND about a girl who sleeps around too much. Some of these songs are WAY beneath Bonnie's stature as a worldwide hit artist, and were written/produced by little know German writers. Other songs do boast big name writers & producers like Giorgio Moroder, Diane Warren, Albert Hammond, & Roy Bittan.      It's a bargain to get all these tracks at this price. Just pick & choose which songs you like best among the pack on this collection.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|There seems to be a lot of focus on Billy's use of the name Smashing Pumpkins, when its only half of the original band. I say who cares? This IS a Smashing Pumpkins record because, with this release, you realize that their signature sound came from Billy's buzzing guitar and one of the best drummers in rock today, Jimmy Chamberlain. This is a beautifully produced, majestic and searing album. Lyrically, it is a reflection of (and on)these turbulent times. The guitar solos have even more bite to them than the original band, and it sounds way better than Zwan, which I wasn't thrilled with. Albums should be evaluated on the quality of the music on the disc. Other considerations are secondary. Don't let the arguments over Billy's band name stop you from enjoying this fine release.
1400032717|2.0|I bought this book because I thought it was a mystery.  Because the title is based on a Holmes story.  And then I read it.  And then there was a murder of a dog.  And then there were a lot of logical lessons and math lessons in between the real story.  And then I skipped over many of these parts because they were boring.  And then I saw that a lot of sentences in this book begin with \\"and then\\".  And then I realized that with the main character being autistic, the author can write like a Special School person, and then I wondered if he could write a real book written like a grownup.  And then I looked for a good ending.  And then there wasn't one.
B000MZHW1S|5.0|this movie is sick. add in the hd-dvd exclusives like web features and ime, and you have the best version of the movie out. when getting warner, always an hd-dvd.
B00009RDGA|5.0|This is a great movie - I still chuckle at Addie demanding her $200.  I wonder if it would get past the censors these days with the scenes of Addie smoking.  Tatum O'Neal thoroughly deserved the Oscar she won.
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|this one will be an hd-dvd purchace for me. blu-ray discs from warner are stripped down of features due to format limitations. no web features, no interactive commentary or menus. i mean its 4 extra bucks forthe hd-dvd because its a combo, but the combo does come in handy if u want to take it to a friends house that doesnt have an hd-dvd player. i have taken advantage of combo discs before.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This film is not for the faint of heart.  And even for those who think they can handle it...man oh man.  It's brutal, violent, gory, messy, messed-up...and absolutely brilliant.  Dont let the subtitles scare you, this is a Korean masterpiece.
B000000WGL|4.0|Speaking of great Keith Songs, Sandra Bernhard covers \\"Out of Tears\\" on \\"everything bad & beautiful\\" (limited edition only) and it is outrageous--the song is a great find too! Definitely something to own for a Keith or Stones fan.[[ASIN:B000ILJIPE Everything Bad & Beautiful]]
B00003CXBK|5.0|The complexity of this story is classic Miyazaki.  The story is great, the imagery is breathtaking.  There are some fantastic lines in the English version--witty Gaiman at work.  I adore the tree spirits...
0061148512|5.0|The item arrived in time and wrapped well, the item is also in good shape thus I gave it a 5 out of 5, great shopping experience.
0671004107|3.0|It has a lot of interesting ideas, and I would say that it's worth looking into.      However:     There's a hell of a lot of filler, and it's in all of the wrong places; the author tends to exhaustively detail irrelevant side-topics while only barely touching major plot devices.  Worse still (to me, at least), the language is extremely dry.  The characters are very bland and one-dimensional, not so much people as they are idealized  Shakespearean characters  that go on long soliloquies about how very beautiful caterpillars are.    I'm about halfway through, and I'll finish it, but I can safely say that it's not for me.
B000BNI90O|5.0|This is no doubt one of the best soundtracks EVER made.  So instead of three pages of praise, I'm going to direct this to those that feel the pricing is too much.  The FOTR OST is 71 minutes long and retailed for $19.98.  FOTR:CR is 3 hours long, nearly three times the length of the OST and retails for $59.98 (Amazon sells it for $39.97 currently, however), roughly three times the cost.  Considering the music alone, the Complete Recordings may seem a bit expensive; however, taking into account the must have \\"The Music of the Lord of the Rings\\" booklet by Doug Adams, the beautiful leather box (minus the annoying rubber hub), and one of the best reasons to own this soundtrack - the entire score on one DVD in full Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound glory!  Finally, this is one of the best, if not the BEST, soundtracks ever made and that should be reason enough for anyone to dish out $40~$60 for this masterpiece.
0307236722|5.0|LOVE IT... LOVE IT... LOVE IT.<br />As much as I hate to line her pockets any further, she has yet to disappoint me.  This book is awesome, great instructions and beautiful pictures.  Nothing less than I expected.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth was the most spetacular video we have ever watched.  The filming was out of this world.  It took us to places we would never have imagined to see and as we watched this video we felt we were actually there experiencing the beauty and action.  We will enjoy this film over and over for many years to come.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|Should have won best picture for 1969. How MIDNIGHT COWBOY got it, I'll never know.
B000008MLS|5.0|OK, Listen Up:    If you have NEVER owned a Frank Zappa album before, this would be a good first one to have.    If you are a FZ fan and DON'T own this album, then you aren't.    If you are TINA TURNER, make sure that this one is on your resume' (yes, it really IS HER!!)    And finally, if anything bad ever happens to your eyes as a result of a conflict with someone named NANOOK, don't go trudging off across the tundra to the Parish of St. Alfonzo - just order this album from Amazon!
0807126063|1.0|I keep reading how wonderful this tome is. I keep hearing how it is a classic.  I have tried upon three separate occasions to get through this mess of a book. The main character is no one to whom I can relate.    After my final VALIANT attempt all the way up to about page 200.......I GAVE UP. Perhaps the artsy set thinks this is wonderful literature.I think the Emperor has no clothes.    WHAT am I missing by not appreciating this work?  NOT MUCH, methinks.
B000MZHW40|5.0|I thought that I had seen all of the movies that I would consider my favorites and I for a long time I felt like I woudln't enjoy them as much as I used to.  This movie came along and blew me away.  Instantly one of my top 5 movies of all time.  What a rollercoaster of a movie and I don't think I have seen better acting in any movie, ever.  DiCaprio is near perfect as are his entire supporting cast.  The fact that this movie is based on a true story makes it even more compelling and enjoyable.  To say the least, I was riveted the entire time and felt immensely for the characters and what they were going through, especially towards the end.  This has to be considered one of the greatest movies ever made and I thought it deserved the Oscar over 'The Departed', which was also very, very good.  Seen it twice in theatre and bought it immediately
1586210912|5.0|If you have limited time to sit and read the book, the CD set is a great way to listen to what Robert T. Kiyosaki has to say as well as what he can teach you.
B000089J0R|5.0|These guys are extremly fast. As a serious metalhead, and as a guy who worships metal like a god, I never encountered songs this fast. Sure there are other songs by other bands that sometimes have tempos this fast, but these guys do it this fast in every song (none of them are short either). Sure the lyrics are cheesy, but that really isn't the point here. These songs are still fast, with incredible solos, and terrific music composition.
B000P2A256|5.0|This is really good music.  This really miraculous music comes freom truly talented artists.  Three years later, I never get tired of listening to Songs About Jane.  I know that three years from now I will still love listening to It Wont Be Soon Before Too Long. Both are PURE GENIUS!!!! I cannot wait for the third album!!!!!!!! SWEET!!!!
B00000JG41|5.0|I have all of Patton's FNM CD's, but this was first attempt at one of his other projects.  I picked it after reading all of the reviews that claimed that California was Bungle's \\"most accessible.\\"  After my first listen I thought it was complete garbage.  I was still ready to toss it in the trash after 3-4 listens.  I gave it a few more listens and liked a few more songs.  By the 10th or so listen it was a full-on addiction, like musical crack.  Patton is incredible on this one.  To me he comes off as a cheeseball lounge singer on most of the tracks.  You have to get this CD and give it some time if it doesn't click right away.  At first I thought that \\"Ars Moriendi\\" and \\"Goodbye Sober Day\\" were possibly the stupidest songs I had ever heard, but now they are my fav songs on the CD.  Stop whatever you are doing and buy this CD.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|The Bourne movies are the best action trilogy. Matt Damon is a rare action hero. This is the Action Movie for the thinking Man.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Former Vice President, Al Gore with the aid of director Davis Guggenheim has delivered an educational and entertaining look at our environment and what we are doing to it. This is an important film that shares the science and the politics behind global warming and how it affects our planet; specifically what has been happening over the last century with a focus on the last 50 years. It also makes a projection for the next 50 years. It is not looking good. The earth is dying and we are the cause.<br /><br />If you watch this film you'll learn how CO2 is killing our planet (70 million tons of CO2 are pumped into the atmosphere every day). You will see footage on the decline of our glaciers, our increasing population, weather disturbances, animal and plant extinctions, an increase in new diseases and most importantly you will learn why it should be important to us. This is definitely an educational film but it's a very important one for our time. And it won't put you to sleep.<br /><br />My only qualm with the film is that it did not spend enough time teaching the viewer enough on what we can do individually and as a society to correct the problem. Fortunately, where the film leaves off, the Climate Crisis website continues. If you visit the Climate Crisis website you will find an educational guide, downloads, news, updates and clips of An Inconvenient Truth's movie trailer.<br /><br />We all play a role in the destruction of our environment; we all need to take a role in saving it beyond recycling and light bulbs. Watch the movie to see what is going on then visit the website to see what you can do to help. Collectively, we can make a difference. Review written by M.E. Wood.
B000RIHBIE|2.0|I thought that Sum 41 would come out with at least a decent CD, but man I was sooo wrong. The CD was no fun! It was alot of boring slow songs. Sometimes those are nice if there is something to them... sadly there wasn't. The faster songs they had weren't even that original. They were the same old anthems that the pop-rock bands have been playing for years. C'mon Sum you had a really good CD last time! Please don't let me down again!

B00005JLCI|4.0|*Please* stop referring to Zeffirelli's version as \\"Mel Gibson's Hamlet.\\"  Just as it was not \\"Drew Barrymore's ET\\" or \\"Al Pacino's The Godfather,\\" this film was made by a masterful filmmaker and should be acknowledged as such.    For those critical of Branagh's choice to stud the cast with Hollywood trinkets (Lemon, Crystal, Heston, etc), bear in mind - this is a *four-hour* period film shot on *70MM* film.  Every scene not only required period costumes and locations, but a 70mm camera & film stock (whch are *far* from cheap).  These folks were thrown in to draw in a paying American audience - and ultimately, to make the film financially possible.    In terms of quality...yes, Branagh had moments - some inspired, some stretched.  But cheers to him for bringing this labor of love to life.  Jacobi is solid, Winslet is divine...  But no one mentions Nicholas Farrell's ingenious portrayal of Horatio - perhaps one of the most difficult roles in the film!  Cheers to him for giving the flat dimension!
B0000VD04M|4.0|This movie is very good, if a little difficult to take because it's pretty frenetic, but that's true to how Ed Wood really was.  Johnny Depp is his usual brilliant self as Ed Wood.  My 18-year-old bought this DVD right after we caught the movie on television, and it's one of her Top 10.  (I know, this surprised me too.)
B000FA5QZO|5.0|Slaughterhouse-five is an example of a rare breed of books- the thing one can read woth ease for pleasure while absorbing the underlying and intentional message.  v onnegut displays the lives of Billy Pilgrim and his compatriots like a real Christian, or Taoist, or whatever -detatched and compassionate and with all the humor and sadness in the world.  Bonus points for considering a theory of time perception that makes sense and no sense.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is, in my opinion, Miyazaki's best film yet. It was my first of his to see, and I have now been able to enjoy Howl's Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (all very interesting and fabulous films) and I can't wait to see more. But I think Spirited Away is his best movie yet because of the creativity, amazing artwork, wonderful characters (who else thinks Yubaba's nose is hilarious?) and fantastic storytelling techniques that Miyazaki uses. His other films are very entertaining as well, but it's almost like Spirited Away has \\"the bow on top\\" while the others do not :) One of my very favorite movies :)

B000VWYJ86|3.0|If you take this movie by itself without seeing the first two, it is very enjoyable.  If you have seen the others, like I have, you will get a sense of deja-vu.  Why, because it is the same movie recycled three times.  We're talking the same car chases, the same endless scenes of Bourne running from the cops, the same single fist fight with a tough assassin, and the same moronic government agents doing the same stupid things.  I felt rather cheated with this last installment.  This is case of producers getting lazy.  The other thing that really drives me nuts is the cinematography.  I would love to get a hold of the guy who thought shaky cameras was a good idea.  The cameras shake constantly and at bizarre angles.  The poor lighting and bland colors make it difficult to see what is going on at times. What was with all the closeups of the drivers' chin during a chase scene?  Dumb. This idiot director even has a scene where Bourne fights two guys in a dark office.  Why?  What is the point of choreographing a fight where nobody can see what the heck is happening?  I can see why people like this movie, because it has some good things in it.  I don't like watching a re-run of a movie that is being packaged as \\"new\\".
B000RJO578|4.0|Although my GenY son encouraged me to watch this, I was truly entertained and amused by watching this flick (do people still call these \\"flicks\\"?!)    Not only were there deeper messages, about enjoying life and friendship, in addition to work, there was the facade of a *perfect town* blown wide open by a vigilant cop, who fought the system.    Further, the ending is one that I was not expecting. To destroy it is not my style, but suffice it to say that the lessons learned were real world and not Hollywood swill. Watch Hot Fuzz-- you probably won't be disappointed!
B000O176Q6|5.0|I have to say that this is the best looking version of Enter the Dragon available. Picture quality is great looking and is probably good as its going to get. Just don't expect this movie to look as crystal clear as the newer movies. Enter the Dragon is a 34 year old movie so don't demand High definition perfection. Sound quality is very nice with a noticeable improvement over the standard DVD. I am a big Bruce Lee fan and Enter the Dragon along with the many special features included in this Blu-ray DVD are a true treasure. There are interviews with Bruce, film footage from \\"Game of Death\\", and many other interesting features. Even though Enter the Dragon is a 34 year old movie its still better than the current action films of today. Had Bruce Lee lived I believe he would still be making great movies today. If you own a Blu-ray player or your a fan of Bruce Lee buy this movie today. May you rest in peace Bruce knowing that your family, friends, many devoted students, and fans miss you everyday.
B0007RO57U|5.0|This used to be available in EMI's double forte series. It went out of print but is now thankfully available in EMI's super cheap Gemini series. This Gemini series has some really great finds and this Handel set is no exception. Buy both 2CD sets and you'll get the whole of Handel's keyboard suites and they've never been realized better than here.    It's strange that someone with the stature of Richter would go after this particular repertoire. There is no truly great music here, it's a bit out of the way but a wonderful counterpart to some of Handel's richer works. Richter partnered with the ,( at the time ), young Gavrilov.     Gavrilov's playing is so rich and imaginative that just as Richter himself noted, people couldn't tell the difference which suite was played by old man Richter or young gun Gavrilov when they listened to this recording. ( Don't worry, the credits are marked in the liner notes for all to see. ) I would say this set is a winner on all counts. Buy this and the other volume as well.
1582701709|1.0|This book just spits out things like, \\"This has been scientifically proven.\\" There is not an ounce of real, hard science in this entire book. I can't believe people actually buy into this garbage. This is just page after page of pseudoscientific nonsense and people just gobble it up because The Great Oprah put it on her book list. James Randi is right, Oprah should be ashamed of supporting this drivel.
B000001F76|5.0|When this came out in October 1990 as a CD version of 1978 PolyGram vinyl LPs it was welcomed by all fans of the late, great Hank Williams who were, quite simply, fed up with phony \\"drain-pipe\\" stereo releases, or those with overdubbed strings and other instruments which had permeated the market back then.<br /><br />That was, in essence, regarded by many as blasphemous treatment of a legend. These CDs, however, were the originals just as he recorded them in glorious mono, and at the time we were even willing to forgive the odd scratchy track [3 on disc 1 and 15 and 20 on disc 2 were mastered from 78 rpm records].<br /><br />There were, admittedly, some key cuts missing from among the 40 selections - such as Honky Tonkin' [# 14 in 1948, I'm A Long Gone Daddy [# 6 in 1948], and Never Again (Will I Knock On Your Door) which was the flip of Lovesick Blues and a # 6 on its own in 1949 - but again we were willing to overlook that too just to get our hands on a decent Hank Williams compilation. And as a bonus there was an insert with a complete discography of the contents along with six pages of background notes written by Tony Byworth, editor of Country Music People, as well as several more candid shots of Hank.<br /><br />But two years later, in 1992, PolyDor/PolyGram came out with a 3-CD box set containing 39 of those 40 tracks [only I Saw The Light is missing], along with another 45 cuts, which immediately surpassed this set.<br /><br />Even so, this is still desirable if only for Byworth's notes which sum up Hank's career with this paragraph \\"Hank Williams couldn't read or write music, but he had created some 125 compositions, many of which have subsequently become classics of popular music. He did live to bask in some of the music's success - but he was not to realize how his material was to alter the whole concept of the idiom by opening up the way for a new breed of country writers and, in turn, songs that would reach mass audiences. Over the years his music has played a vital role in furthering the careers of a diverse range of artists that has included Frankie Laine, Ray Charles, Jerry Lee Lewis, Del Shannon, Johnny Cash and Dean Martin.\\"<br /><br />To that list can be added names like Jo Stafford, Tony Bennett, Fats Domino, Rosemary Clooney, and Joni James, among many many more. One can only wonder at what classic tunes died with him on New Year's Day, 1953 when he left us some nine months shy of his 30th birthday.the careers of a diverse range of artists that has included Frankie Laine, Ray Charles, Jerry Lee Lewis, Del Shannon, Johnny Cash and Dean Martin.\\"    To that list can be added names like Jo Stafford, Tony Bennett, Fats Domino, Rosemary Clooney, and Joni James, among many many more.

B000654Z2I|5.0|Many people like the more traditional tracks and somewhat dismiss Aumgn and Peking O as a little bit too much out there. I admit when I first heard it I was a bit skeptical myself. But something caught me...just a little bit. I continued to listen to this album pretty much once a day and it did not take more than a few days before those two insane tracks caught on to the point where I actually wanted to listen to them.    Yes, Halleluhwah is still the best track. But do not dismiss Aumgn and Peking O as just experimental noise. If you pay attention there are all sorts of interesting melodies going on there. For example in Peking O you can hear a snippet of an ethnic dance type vibe. Which is pretty bizarre to hear an ethnic dance snippet smack dab in the middle of this very psychedlic track.    If you like early Pink Floyd you will probably like this.    Summary, you will almost certainly like the \\"obvious\\" tracks but listen to the whole album.
B000001F26|3.0|The 10 to 12 track CD is essentially a fossil these days, but when it first came out as CD in 1988 from Polydor/Universal Music Group, with absolutely nothing in the way of liner notes, that was what we received for the most part from major distributors, their attitude being, if it was good enough for a vinyl album it's good enough for an mp.3-version offering. But consumers very soon forced their hand by ignoring such offerings when the likes of Ace of London, Bear Family, Rhino, Eric and others began turning out 18 to 30-track volumes with copious liner notes and discographies/sessionographies.<br /><br />Having said that, if you're an Eric Clapton fan the AAD sound here is excellent and it does give you nine of his best hits registered from 1970 to 1980 for Atco and RSO, including his only # 1 Billboard Pop Hot 100, I Shot The Sheriff, from 1974, and the second charted version of Layla (the nickname of Patty Boyd who was George Harrison's wife from 1966 to 1974 and then was married to Clapton from 1979 to 1988). Both were billed as Derek & The Dominos, a group which also included Duane Allman, and the initial shorter single went to # 51 Hot 100 in the spring of 1971. The one presented here is the 7:10 LP version from the Derek & The Dominos Atco album \\"Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs\\" which itself peaked at # 10 on the album charts in July 1972.<br /><br />Indeed, the only significant (Top 40 Hot 100) selections from that period not presented here are 1976's Hello Old Friend, which reached # 24, 1979's Watch Out For Lucy, the flip of Promises (a # 6 Adult Contemporary (AC)/# 9 Hot 100) and a # 40 on its own, and 1980's Tulsa Time, his cover of the Don Williams 1978 Country hit which made it to # 30 (they do, however, include the flipside, Cocaine, which is regarded as a \\"follow-along\\" hit). His rendition of Dylan's Knockin' On Heaven's Door, although released as a single in 1975, did not chart, while Swing Low Sweet Chariot comes from the 1975 LP \\"There's One In Every Crowd.\\"<br /><br />Accompanying musicians include bassist Carl Radle, guitarist George Terry, organist Dick Sims and drummer Jamie Oldaker on tracks 1, 3, 4 and 6 to 11, pianist Albhy Galuten on tracks 1 and 11, drummer Jim Gordon, guitarist Delaney Bramlet, organist Bobby Whitlock, pianist Leon Russell, saxophonist Bobby Keys, and trumpeter Jim Price on tracks 2 and 5 (except Bramlet is replaced by Duane Allman and Whitlock handles both organ and piano on track 5), and vocalists Marcy Levy on tracks 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10, Yvonne Elliman on 1, 3, 4, 6 to 8, 10 and 11, and Tom Bernfield on 11.<br /><br />To sum up, if you are searching for only a few of Clapton's hits and they happen to be in this volume, and you don't really care about liner notes, this is a good buy. Otherwise dig deeper into the Amazon vaults.<br /><br />Some critics have charged Clapton with being \\"overrated.\\" Well, let's look at the facts. Starting out with The Roosters in his native U.K. in 1963 when he was just 18, he was a member of The Yardbirds from 1963 to 1965 where he was given the nickname Slowhand, then John Mayall's Bluesbreakers in 1965/66 followed by his formation of Cream with Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce in 1966, and then Blind Faith in 1968. He also worked with John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band and Delaney & Bonnie, and in 1970 formed Derek & The Dominos. He was inducted into the R&R Hall of Fame in 2000.

0753820250|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  It is an extremely well-written translation from Spanish.  I was immediately drawn into the story and became attached very quickly to the lively and colorful characters.  The setting was well depicted and I had no trouble imagining the characters in Barcelona as I read.  Although the book was long, I was able to complete it in about a week as I couldn't put it down.  I also loved the ending...the author managed to maintain an air of mystery throughout.  It is rare to read a book that is well written, with an exciting plot, interesting characters, and a fabulous ending.  This book would make a great movie...I especially would love to see the character, Fermin, come to life! :)
B000SQFC18|5.0|I was completely taken by the plot of this film. I absolutely loved it. The way everything was put together at the end was fabulous.
B000QUCNOK|1.0|Okay so the film is entitled, \\"The Story of a Murderer.\\" But the main character is never fully explained, so I sat through the movie waiting for a medieval execution...But the ending is so hokey and really pissed me off. Why should you glorify a character that murdered several women? And what happens to those women...I don't want to put any spoilers in my review, but this seems like a film specifically for misogynists. Better movies in which the killer doesn't get much explanation: \\"Elephant\\" \\"The Hitcher\\" Even \\"House of 1000 Corpses\\" was better than this.
1577314808|5.0|This book has changed my life! I love the spiritual side of it as well. It's teaching on living in the now reather than past or future has given me a sense of peace that I have never experineced before. I have bought additional works by the author and am enjoying them fully as well!
0060763892|4.0|Excellent product! Excellent delivery to me in New Zealand from USA.  A most outstanding read, well worth the purchase.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|Was a little disappointed, but still a fairly good movie. Would classify this movie more of a romantic fantasy than drama. None of Eisenheim's illusions could possibly be performed by an illusionist from any era. All are achievable solely by using special effects. At the end, when Inspector Uhl works out all the steps that led to the final conclusion, we are still left with a lot of holes that need to be explained before we can accept all that happened. The movie's plot requires each character to react in a precise manner in order for the final plan to succeed. While still an enjoyable film, it's recommended that you leave logic and common sense at the door and just enjoy the film for what it is.
0385340559|5.0|I just recently started reading the Lee Childs books and I have now read all of them.  Jack Reacher is the badest of the bad, and he comes through every time.  This book was hard to put down once you had read the first few pages.

B000VNMMQ6|3.0|I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing but Live Free or Die Hard does not for one second pretend to be convincing, so it takes on the most unrealistic elements one could possibly muster up. The appeal toward the original Die Hard was that it did seem more real than your typical action flick but at this point in the series, a third sequel has no business being anything other than a $100 million quasi-self-parody. The film doesn't hide this and it really struggles to pull off even a partially real moment. However, holding it up to serious movies is not giving Live Free or Die Hard a fair shake, but then again its intentions do weigh in on my less then perfect rating.<br /><br />As a pure action movie and nothing more, Live Free or Die Hard is nearly perfect. My only complaint is it tried a little too hard to convince me on the computer hacking technology. Given the scene where Bruce Willis surfs on top of an F-35 Lightning II, it didn't need to dig too deeply into the technology jargon or convince me what was happening was real in any way. Too much time was spent on that stuff. I knew after about two minutes into the movie exactly what I wanted out of it; and that was some kung-fu, shooting, crashing cars and explosions. I just so happen to get some Jet surfing, collapsing bridges, elevators falling and utter urban chaos to spice things up even further.<br /><br />Anyway, the federal government is in big trouble as the FBI systems are breached by computer hackers who are basically contracted to do this from a terrorist group lead by a former federal big wig out for revenge after some political embarrassment (Timothy Olyphant in a very effective villain performance). The hackers are not really going to get paid though as they are systematically assassinated by these terrorists one by one after they've served their purposes. Enter Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis), who is told by a superior to pick up a hacker suspect (Justin Long). Great action scene as John rescues this guy from his assassination. John has to get this hacker to DC for questioning. Meanwhile, the traffic systems are collapsing and the stock market crashes. What is happening is an all out systems attack on vital networks of the government and the economy. Records are destroyed, transportation is ruined, utilities like water and gas are being manipulated, the media is taken over and fear propaganda is spread etc. You get the picture; the country is being driven into anarchy. That really just sets the stage. As things unfold the action just gets more and more exciting and ridiculous.<br /><br />I guess it is easier to do a pure action like this when we are already sold on the hero. If you've seen the prior films then character development for you is just not a necessity, at least for the protagonist. But Live Free or Die Hard does effectively present new characters for the most part. Maggie Q as a little kung-fu using sidekick and love interest to Olyphant's primary villain character is great, but on the other hand Mary Elizabeth Winstead is kind of annoying as Lucy McClane, John's teenage daughter. It is hit more than miss as far as that goes but that really shouldn't be the lens in which you approach a film like this anyway. Just sit back and enjoy. If you find yourself laughing and throwing up your arms at the level to which Live Free or Die Hard expects you to suspend disbelief, you are certainly not alone.guy from his assassination.

B000BW7QWW|3.0|They could have made sure of sequel or at least tried to save the series with a better movie.  Killing off two major characters only told me that the director was done with trying to resurrect or do the series any justice.  Just like the TV series, another opportunity just blown to bits.  It could have actually been a great movie, but for some reason the director/writers just blew it.<br /><br />Mel did not behave at all like the character in the TV series.  It took a long time to develop those characters, but the movie simply ignored all of that.  Too bad.
B000244FDW|5.0|I find it exceedingly paradoxical that so many self-proclaimed Pride and Prejudice fans denigrate the 1980 version, yet adore the inferior, albeit more known 1995 version. Prior to watching this excellent adaptation, the A&E production was admittedly my favourite. I too, like so many other P+P enthusiasts adored it upon the first viewing. It wasn't so much the portrayal of the characters in the 1995 production that impressed me, rather, it was the dialogue, the scenery (for obvious reasons) and how naturally everthing unfolded. I took some issue with some of the liberties the director took-Mr Darcy jumping into the vermin filled pool etc.-but the dialogue between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth charmed me enough that I was able to overlook those minor foibles of the 1995 version.     Imagine my surprise, or horror rather, when I bought this version and discovered that the an inordinate amount of the dialogue from the 1995 version was sufficiently similar to the dialogue from this version as to render the dialogical origin of the 1995 version suspect. The discussion between Eliza and Mr. Darcy at Netherfield about pride and vanity and how the latter is a fault, but the former is justified if there is a true superiority of mind is one example that I cite; another is Miss Bingley's speech about \\"Elizabeth's lack of beauty\\" at Pemberley: \\"I remember you said, Mr. Darcy, she a beauty, I should sooner call her mother a wit.\\"     That said, I haven't forgotten about the lamentable travesty that is the 2005 version. I first I knew I was in trouble when I witnessed the overtly rustic, pathetic excuse of a house the Bennets supposedly lived in. The 'manners,' or lack of manners, rather, that Keira's Elizabeth posessed made me wonder what it was that was so superior about her in comparison to her sisters or the rest of her lot in general. Leave it to Hollywood to confuse Elizabeth with a modern day feminist. Uncoventional, outspoken and witty Elizabeth may have been, but a shrill, ill-bred feminist she certainly was not. As for Mr. Darcy...the hair, the hair, the air, the complete lack of an air of nobility, of pride, of principle and goodness beneath his veneer of...pride, what pride? If you ask me, he merely appeared pathetic and dejected throughout the entire film. Why anyone was offended by his pathetic, melancholy countenance is beyond me. I felt sorry for the guy.     This version is infinitely superior to the other two, alhough the 1995 version does have its merits. Garvie's Elizabeth is wonderfully realized. She is at once impertinent, witty, sweet, and sympathetic. Rintoul's Darcy is handsome and certainly aristocratic, although I thought he could have softened up a bit in the latter part of the film where he is supposedly humbled. The secondary characters are also excellent. The budget did not hinder the beauty of this production. The costumes look realistic and it isn't without its share of the picturesque sceneries that poeple so admire about the 1995 version. Without a doubt, this is the version to watch for Jane Austen fans who admire her work not merely for their romantic plots, but for their wit, their distinct sense of humour, and their colorful and diverse characters.
B000RO9PXC|4.0|Many of these reviews have been negative.  I have to say that I was quite entertained by this 3 disc set.  This is not the finest, most polished music the band has released but it is fun to listen to.  The band does an adequate or better job, Jim says silly things and screams, and the sound quality is great for the age.      I would recommend this album before the Live in Philadelphia but after Detroit.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I have seen a short videoclip from this movie on the web entitled the 'Seducation of Jane Eyre', and I think this phrase really \\"hit the nail on the head\\". It is the modern, sexual interpretation of a very poetic and spiritual work. However, being the daughter of this age too, I loved it for all its virtues. I was particularly happy about the casting - I think the choices there were superb. Anyone who says Toby Stephens is too young to play Rochester is an idiot: he himself was 37 when the movie was made and Rochester is around 38 in the book - so stop repeating this in any criticism please. Even though Stephens is heartbreakingly handsome (which might add to his looking younger), he is pretty dark here and can look as ugly as Rochester really should (he has a great talent in smirking and frowning enough to make him so). Here, I must agree with the producers: this story is not about two ugly people falling in love with each other; also ugliness is just as relative as beauty - in the movie they actually make Rochester articulate how wealth improves his looks in some people's eyes. Stephens absolutely worked as Rochester, he is a very talented actor and I think he could have given the character even more depth if directed so. Ruth Wilson was a very good choice too and played up to the role, however, given some more better lines, she could have convinced us with a little more brains as well as expressive looks. That's where this movie fails for me only: where it tries to modernise the language and the imagery of the book and replace it with its own inventions (the twins, blood, birds and butterflies) - they are logical and work on their own right, but why not trust the original to be understood and embraced by a contemporary audience? I liked Rochester's allusion to a firebird living on his estate, which is similar at least to the book's scene where Rochester teases Adele with taking mademoiselle to the moon (yet why I prefer the latter?). I found it also far-fetched when R. and J. lie in Jane's bed after it's revealed that he is married - the scene is necessary but the love making there was a bit too much. Bronte's book is full of kisses and passion, right, but they are not used as arguments alone. All in all, the scenery, the acting and the music(!) of this movie is absolutely captivating, while it could have preserved more of Charlotte Bronte's playful, exciting and sometimes surprisingly modern language. I am still hoping to live a few more decades to see someone have a try at it with the same sort of vision but greater respect and love of the original.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|The plot of Napoleon Dynamite is all about friendship and courage. It's about being a square peg, yet fitting in. It's about liking yourself no matter what anyone else thinks of you. It's a movie that says sometimes people who tell tall tales can be endearing. It's a story about talent and the courage to let it shine. It's a story about success in the face of failure through the belief in one's self. Even if it sometimes moved like actors on valium, the point rung out loud and clear !<br /><br />Five stars for an excellent movie made for all young people age 10 to 110.  Dare to be yourself.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I'm counting down the days until the 2nd season of Supernatural comes out on dvd. Being a big fan of the show form day one, I didn't think it could possibly get better than the 1st season, but it just continues to grow and develop. I think my favorite part of this show is the relationship between Sam and Dean, and this season really explored that. The two are so similar in some ways, yet also very different (if that makes any sense). I have so many favorite episodes from this year that it's hard to single out any, but if I was going to pick one I'd say the two part finale. Both Jensen Ackles and Jared Padelecki are incredible actors, and they perfectly capture the loyalty and love the two brothers share. Given the way the season ended, I can't wait for the new season to start!
159562015X|2.0|Really, the reason for this book is to get the access code to take the online StrengthsFinder assessment. The book doesn't give you much more information than what you get online, so it's clearly just a ploy to make more money. If they really wanted to give people more value with the book, they should include more occupational information, and more information about using your strengths throughout the lifespan. Or, how about a section for counselors to help them utilize the StrenghsFinder in the career counseling process?
B000EULJLU|3.0|They are getting to be tools though, this is embarrassing.  There is art and music and I liked the first two albums the best.  Especially back when that video came out, do you know what Ima talkin aboot?  That Claymation guy running around ripping up floorboards and punching holes in walls looking for his booze!  That was totally awesome, just knarly in a jingo manga kind of way.  That song was called Sober, and that album was the stuff all right.  Then the next album was pretty good, but then came all the Schism and before ya know it the art is gone and they sound more like Some Dirge Metal band without a singer, just chugging a lot of bass and somewhere in all that it is supposed to be music.  10,000 days marks years of prison in some countries, and maybe these guys still rock over there, but really the fame has come and gone.  Like the prom queen, cute for a year and beautiful on that one night but then ten years down the road just blah!

B00005JPLW|1.0|This movie had great special effects but how many times do you want to see someone impaled on a spear, hit with a shield and listen to the voices of men who keep claiming they fight for \\"freedom\\" when they have one of the most repressive societies ever?    Too many anachronisms, for example one character says something like \\"what the hell?\\" Oh, sure, that was a true Spartan phrase.    The monster men of the movie are ludicrous too.

0385333846|5.0|This is the sixth novel I've read by Mr. Vonnegut, although it's the first of his that I've read in several years. Reading this book was sort of like becoming re-acquainted with an old friend. Although I had remembered how inventive, creative and simultaneously sweet and cynical Vonnegut's books were, I had forgotten how much fun they were to read. Similar themes tend to pop up in Vonnegut's novels: the twisted ridiculousness of war, religion and human nature being the most persistent. However, at his best he seems to rise above cynicism and actually offer somewhat optimistic insight into the human condition, although it's often so concealed in humor and fantasy that you might not even realize that you've been hit with something profound. In \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\", the aliens who kidnap Billy Pilgrim can see all of time as clearly as we can see the horizon. Since the future is so clear and fixed to them, they advise Billy simply to \\"look at the things you like and don't look at the things you don't.\\" For an American Science Fiction writer, it's a curiously Eastern way of thinking.

0515125024|3.0|I have to agree with another reviewer that called this a fairy tale for men. Reacher takes on powers of nearly mythic proportions in this novel. He can shoot the world's most powerful sniper rifle with an effectiveness never before seen. Every woman loves him and every man respects him. Well all the men that don't want him dead. Yet, even they respect him enough to keep him alive when he is obviously a threat.     I don't want to sound too negative. The pacing is good and the dialogue doesn't seem forced or riddled with clichés. Most of the necessary characters are fleshed out in decent manner. There is also a good bit of suspense regarding certain sub plots. Lee Child uses the devices of writing well and comes up with a decent read.
0140620222|4.0|Who could not get swept up in the thorny romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy? And what girl hasn't fallen in love at least a little bit with the prickly yet big-hearted Mr. Darcy? This book has been made into mutiple miniseries (the A&E one is hands-down my favorite) and movies,  while many modern screenplays have borrowed (and downright stolen) from this classic, romantic comedy of errors--or prejudices if you will--and for good reason. Like a fine wine, this novel just seems to keep getting better with (my) age.

031286504X|5.0|I agree with some of the other reviewers who \\"complained\\" that this short story / novel was too short.  but you know, that was probably because i enjoyed it so much.  I'm a huge fan of the kind of books that start you out with some kind of world changing event and then drawing you into one person who's trying to survive.  Looking forward to the movie with Will Smith, even though he would not be my first choice.
B000089RV6|5.0|This Aussies AC/DC album is one of the best Rock albums ever made.<br />All songs are not good, but REALLY GOOD! In addition, this new reissue has an outstanding sound quality.<br />You say you go crazy for Pure Rock, but haven't heard this album yet... Get it right now! Period.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Over the last year, I heard quite a bit of buzz over the Internet and other communities about a series called \\"Firefly\\".  So many folks saying what a fantastic show it was and how it's so horrible that the series was ended so prematurely.  I found my self visiting the DVD section every time I visited the local Target stores--just looking at the Firefly DVD over and over thinking to myself \\"Some day I'll get a copy and see what the buzz is all about.\\"  Heck, it was only 20something dollars!!!  You would have thought I could spare that for a whole season of a completely \\"buzzed about\\" series...  Well, I turned 41 this past June (that would be in 2007).  On my birthday, my ex-BF gave me Firefly.  A busy life I lead, so it took me a while (about a month) before I popped it into the old DVD player.  When I did, however, I was enthralled (almost literally glued to my seat) for the next few days.  Watching episode after episode, the only thought running through my head was how any TV executive in his/her right mind would cancel this series before the first season was over.  So much \\"crud\\" on television today, and this gem, this jewel, this extremely intelligent Space Opera has been passed over!  I literally am sick to my stomach thinking about how I'm going to watch the last episode of the series tomorrow night.  Yes, there are special features to be seen after the last episode, and I am grateful.  But it's all overshadowed by the pit I feel in my stomach--the pit of knowing that I have only been given a glimpse of this world, and really won't get to see much of it ever again...  I do have the release of the special edition of Serenity to look forward to.  Release Date:  08/21--feels like forever right now...  I guess I just need to be glad that I really do have more than just the final episode to watch--I have the movie as well.  Well, I know this is supposed to be a review of the Serenity movie, and not the FireFly series, but the two are so intertwined that you can't help talk about one when you talk about the other.  Well, here's wishing that the word get spread so far and wide about how fantastic that this series (and I'm sure, the movie as well) is, that the \\"powers that be\\" will pull their collective heads out of the sand and do what is necessary to entice, empower, or  Joss Whedon into continuing this master in some form or fashion to satisfy the emptiness that I'm about to experience.  Oh yeah, and the emptiness that all the other multitude of fans are currently expierencing.  Rock on, you solders!
1881273156|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and I sure am glad.  It fully explains how a relationship can break down due to the lack of communication and how the love we think we are relaying to our partner gets lost because its not understood by them.  It explains the importance of speaking your mate's love language so they feel the love that you have for them.  The test at the back of the book will reveal your primary love language.  With the five types reviewed in detail, along with some great suggestions, you're sure to have the tools you need for communicating effectively with your partner.      A must read if you are serious about your relationship!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|The best drama on tv, period.  People wanting \\"answers\\" and whining all the time are the people who would be better off renting a Steven Segal action movie.  If you want dumb then watch dumb, dummy!  If you want invigorating and challenging concepts that are a journey of progressive, real life situations then take a chance on any season of Lost.  Again, not for the slow kind, or mind popcorn poo poo heads that keep chiming in here like they even know anything about cinematic brilliance.
B0009P42VE|5.0|Most of the reviews for this say \\"I wanted the DVD version, not the UMD for PSP version\\", even though it clearly states \\"UMD for PSP\\". DERRRR. Of course it's not the DVD version. READ POEPLE!!! This movie is great on UMD for PSP and DVD. If you have never seen this movie before you should buy this. But make sure you buy the right one, and don't be like the idiots that thought it was the DVD version.
B000OY8NII|4.0|DVD Technical Review: easy to navigate, nice basic features...what most would expect.  DVD Content Review: In addition to the episodes, the additional content seemed a little light, but it was satisfactory.  The stories themselves seem to have some minor continuity issues, with some threads that seemingly do not get picked up.  But overall, it is good entertainment.

B00005JPLW|5.0|OK, at the outset, let's have out with the obvious:  they did some historical fudging.  There, now it's all out in the open & there will be no surprises.  I've not read any other reviews, but I'm sure some of them will go to great lengths to point out the places in the movie where historical veracity was lacking.<br /><br />I would like to take a slightly different approach.  The makers of the movie obviously knew their history, and there are some subtle allusions to historical fact, IF you're willing to look closely.<br /><br /> First off, the bit about Leonidas climbing up to see the Ephors and the oracle was nonsense.  HOWEVER, this was a legitimate historical allusion to the Oracle of Delphi, which is where the Spartans & all the other Greeks went to seek the sage guidance of the gods (namely Apollo).  It is true that the Spartans were very religious;  they were tardy to the battle of Marathon because they had to wait until the full of the moon.  In reality, the Ephors were a part of the governmental apparatus;  they were mid-level Spartan officers.  There were 5 of them and they served as a sort of oversight committee.  The Spartan girl mimicked the Pythia, who would fall into a trance and predict the future @ Delphi.<br /><br />The Greek coalition with the Spartans played a far greater role than is shown in the film.  Also, the Thespians and the Lacedamon Helots stayed behind w/the Spartans and fought to a last man.  This fact is absent from the movie.  However, we need to remember that the focus of the film was, after all, to be on the 300.<br /><br />It is nonsense that Leonidas nearly took 1/2 of Xerxes' face off in the final confrontation.  HOWEVER, according to legend there was an assasination attempt on Xerxes' life on the 2nd night.  So the story goes, a covert group of Spartans penetrated the Persian camp and nearly got him.  Nobody knows whether this is historically accurate or not.  In any case, this scene is a nice symbolic representation of that episode.<br /><br />Now on to the the most interesting aspects of the film.  Gerard Butler is terrific as the gallant Leonidas;  a strong leader, determined, true to the Spartan code-of-honor and very focused on his objective.  Lena Headey is his equal as the Spartan queen, Gorgo.  It's also nice to note how the film points out how Spartan women had more rights than elsewhere in the ancient world.  The scene where Gorgo speaks in front of the Gerousia is tenable as the voices of Spartan women WERE taken seriously.<br /><br />The battle scenes are well done, and the very first battle scene is likely the closest as cinema will ever come to re-creating how the Lacedamons actually fought in their phalanx.  I rather doubt any other film will ever be able to out-do it, whether it's made next year or 500 years from now.  As King Leonidas would say:  \\"Your spear is for yourself;  your shield is for the line!\\"<br /><br />In my mind, this film has something for everyone.  Women will like it because it includes a genuine Spartan love story, + the Spartans are all buffed up.  Men will like it because it's a war movie filled up-close-and-personal battle scenes.  Historians will like it because it provides an impressionistic representation of what happened @ Thermopylae in August of 480BCE.  The movie even contains an anachronistic allusion to King Aegisalius.  What more could you ask for?<br /><br />For those who wish to have further reading I would recommend [[ASIN:0140449086 The Histories (Penguin Classics)]],[[ASIN:055338368X Gates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae]] and [[ASIN:0306813602 Thermopylae: The Battle for the West]].

0060589280|5.0|As a writer myself, I am amazed by the talent and brilliance of Coelho.  I do not believe you can learn to write like this.  It is pure inspiration writing from a higer source that Coelho is in touch with.  This book was certainly a masterpiece and enjoyable every second of my reading.  Couldnt wait to come back to it after putting it down.  11 minutes discussed and explores the biggest area in all our lives  sex and love.  The story is enlightening and exquisitely crafted by the best writer that I have ever come in contact with.  Thanks again Paulo, wish I had what you have.  Perhaps it will come along in my search for excellence in writing.  Highly recommended.  Im now reading Coelos latest book.  Ive read them all and will keep reading as long as he keeps writing.
B000654YRY|5.0|I had the VHS version of this concert. I used to play it over and over again. Wondered how I never grew tired of it. Obviously, I got the DVD when I found it.   This is a very neat concert. Stage performance is neat, crowd is neat and sound is neat. Has a little bit of more orchestration than the album versions. This is on the eve of On every street tour. Never one place I feel fatigueness or irritation. It can be thoroughly enjoyed. Sultans of swing would have been nice. But that apart it still is great. No additional sound processing for the DVD version. But I'm going to give it a 5, if not I will not be doing justice to the performance.

B000TGJ8AS|5.0|The fourth season is a great continuation of this fantastic series.  The writing has remained consistently great.  Well written plots, with great dialogue make for a good show.  It is the development of the characters that separates this from other good shows.  As real people do, these characters grow and change with their experiences.  This season started with a bang, literally.  This season also contained more story arcs that run through the season and collide together at the cliffhanger.  Always entertaining with plenty of action and drama, but also full of humor, NCIS is simply great.
0316067598|5.0|I was very happy with this recent book purchase.  I skimmed over some of the bootcamp and SEAL training chapters.  But the operation was very interesting and left me feeling very proud of the service of these special forces.  I am an ex-Navy veteran that did not serve during combat operations and I fully respect those that have.  This true story is full of surprise and heartache, however, it more importantly shares the human spirit of our U.S. soldiers serving overseas.  Nice job to Marcus on taking this story public... God bless the warriors who gave the ultimate sacrifice to our nation.
1594489505|5.0|I read The Kite Runner, which I really enjoyed. So it was a no-brainer to buy A Thousand Splendid Suns. This book was so hard to put down. The plight of these women and the challenges they faced in a country during so much war and turmoil was so intriguing. I felt I was right there, living in their neighborhood, sitting on their couch, peering out her window, crying for their losses, loving her children, and hating (yet strangely appreciating) their husband. What made it even more fantastic for me was that it was written by a man who touched the viewpoints of these women so perfectly! His writing made me feel so much from anger to laughter to tears. My emotions ran the gamut and I continue to be so impressed with Hosseini's storytelling. I can't wait for his next one!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Michael Jackson's incredibly popular \\"Thriller\\" became to my generation the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" just as MJ himself became our Beatles. Reviewing \\"Thriller\\" is like reviewing Elvis' best-of CD, or a Shakespeare collection. It is not easy, nor as useful, because for those who appreciate this genre, we already know it and love it. This album, if nothing else, is MJ's legacy, and is the starting point for all discussions about 80s pop music, MTV, videos and MJ's unusual career.<br /><br />It has earned the world's best-selling album of all-time not because one hit, or even two, or one blockbuster career-establishing hit. It established a new era of pop rock, pushing arena rock and dance rock into a new stratosphere. For me, six songs are favorites, but the rest are still very above average.<br /><br />Frankly, the interviews were interesting, but not so much that I want to listen to them over and over.<br /><br />Standout Tracks<br />\\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" Driving home the refrain like a machine gun, Jackson starts this album with a statement that something was starting. An affair? A great album? Or, a wave that turned Michael from a pretty good entertainer to the \\"King of Pop.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Girl Is Mine,\\" is like receiving the torch from the previous king of pop, Paul McCartney, Michael sings a playful, flirtatious duet with Paul. The memorable line, \\"I'm a lover, not a fighter,\\" has since become part of Americana.<br /><br />\\"Thriller\\" Funky. Now, it sounds so familiar that I forget how unusual it was in the day. The first few ominous notes tell the listener this is no ordinary radio song. Vincent Price plays off his creepy reputation as a movie ghoul while parodying bad rap to lift this song to that place beyond.<br /><br />\\"Beat It\\" Two words: music video. Whatever music videos were before, \\"Beat It\\" took a fantastic dance tune and gave us the definition of videos for years.<br /><br />\\"Billie Jean\\" Like \\"Beat It,\\" its video is par excellence. While Michael argues whether he is the parent, he cranks out moves that are still imitated, parodied and repeated in every club in the world.<br /><br />\\"P.Y.T.

B000002UVX|5.0|This is the consumate concert of Jimi Hendrix just playing his quitar live with two 'in the pocket' musicians--Billy Cox and Buddy Miles.  There's no overdubs--No studio tricks--It's just live with Jimi at his most coherent and argueably 'in the moment' performance ever captured for your 'Ear Goggles'.  The anti-war sentiment in 'Machine Gun' rings true now as it did then and is worth the price of admission alone.  Not for when the party is at it's peak but for when the herd thins out and the sun's coming up.  Enjoy.
B000RJO578|3.0|I really liked Shaun of the Dead, which was made by the same people as Hot Fuzz. With Shaun, however, I found the movie got less funny as the violence and body count increased. Hot Fuzz is similar: as the mayhem takes over, the jokes become fewer. It was an entertaining flick--not as fresh or as funny as Shaun of the Dead, but worth watching.
0805047905|5.0|My son loved this from super young on. Know several other Mom's who also have this and LOVE it. Would recommend this one over and over again.
B00009Z576|4.0|First of all, let me tell you that I am a Forty-something Classic Rock fan.  I bought the early YES albums as a teenager based on songs that I had heard on the radio such as \\"Roundabout\\" and \\"I've Seen All Good People\\".  I did not buy everything they put out, as I was too busy purchasing all the Led Zeppelin and Rush albums of the time.  Anyway, I probably only had three of their albums until 1983 when they released 90125 and there was a resurgence in the bands popularity.<br /><br />All the albums released between Yessongs and 90125 I did not own, and really didn't know anything about them.  In my later years I have begun to replace my old classic vinyl titles with compact discs, especially remastered updated versions.  Rhino Records is one of the best at providing the music buying public a great product at a good price.<br /><br />As I researched the YES music I began purchasing albums I did not previously own.  Reading reviews by other music fans really helps alot.  Relayer and Going For One came first.  I'm still reluctant about Tales of Topographic Oceans, since it has ended up on many Worst Album lists in the past.  I also held off on Drama, due to the absence of Jon Anderson.  I couldn't imagine what that would sound like.  Well, I was pleasently surprised!  As I listened to the first track, Machine Messiah, which, by the way is a \\"classic Yes\\" epic length track (10+ minutes), it did indeed \\"sound\\" like YES.  I realized that along with Anderson, Chris Squire and Steve Howe provide backing vocals & harmonies.  That makes Anderson just 1/3 of the vocals on most songs.<br /><br />I would even challange most casual fans (like myself) to even notice that Jon Anderson wasn't on this album, It is just that good.  I liked it, and as usual, the Rhino remaster is another excellant addition to my growing CD collection.<br /><br />Don't dismiss this until you give it a listen.  You may just like it too!

0307237699|5.0|I read this book to find out who Obama is and came away learning so much more.  Not only is the book easily readable, but it helps put our political history in a perspective that is both genuine and promising. After reading this book, I feel Obama is certainly a worthy candidate for the presidency given his views and involvement with the democratic process. I no longer think of him as naive, rather I find his thinking sound, honest and in the best interest of the country.

0790744295|4.0|This is a classic horror film. I'm not the kind of person who uses 'classic' just to describe any \\"old\\" film. \\"Creepshow\\" is justified as a classic because 1.) it is the successful teaming of two veteran masters of the macabre, Stephen King & George A. Romero, and 2.) Not only is it funny, scary, disgusting, but the best thing about it is that it combines live action with the comic book style of the '50's on which the film is tributing....  1.) Father's Day *** out of ****  Starring Viveca Lindfors; The corpse of an evil murdered father returns from the grave for his Father's Day cake along with revenge. This is a standard but good 'thing from the grave' story.  2.) The Lonesome Death Of Jordie Verrell *** out of ****  Starring Stephen King; A dim-witted farmer touches a metorite and grass starts growing on him at a rapid rate. It is a humorous little story and somewhat terrorfying in the way of 'imagine if this was happening to you?'. The title is taken from a Bob Dylan song \\"The Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carroll\\".  3.) Something To Tide You Over **** out of ****  Starring Leslie Nielson & Ted Dansen; The best story in the film! A possessive husband decides to get revenge on his wife who wants a divorce and her lover. He tortures them by burying them up to their heads in the sand while the tide comes in. Both Leslie Nielson and Ted Danson give dynamic performances which help to make this story the best of the bunch.  4.) The Crate ***1/2 out of ****  Starring Hal Holdbrook, Fritz Weaver & Adrienne Barbeau; The second best story here. A century old crate is discovered underneath the staircase of a university and the blood thirsty creature inside. It seems like an air-tight way for a professor to get rid of his shrew of a wife. Great performances and several horrifying scenes (the creature biting and clawing the student's face).  5.) They're Creeping Up On You! *** out of ****  Starring E.G. Marshall; This story is the creepiest and scariest! An evil, eccentric old millionaire with a bug phobia is attacked by six-jillion roaches. It's more terrifying for me because I'm grossed out by and scarred of bugs (especially roaches), so the final scene is very disgusting. What I like most about it though is the evil sense of humor the guy has that's shown through speaker phone conversations with his employees and the wife of the man who he drove to suicide. They really paint an unflattering portrait of this guy so that the roach attack in the end is justified.  As a whole, I give the film ***1/2 out of ****. It's not so much that the first two stories and the last story could have been better, they were what they were and they were all enjoyable, but it was the third and forth stories that gave it much more weight for me. All together, the film was a very enjoyable horror film, and one of my favorites.  Also see my reviews of \\"Creepshow 2\\", \\"Twilight Zone - The Movie\\" & \\"Tales From The Darkside: The Movie\\"....
B000PY52EU|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from Black Snake Moan. Do you know how movies like Cold Mountain and Big Fish have their own way of dealing with time and traveling? Black Snake Moan has it's own way of mastering the sense of being in America. The music is great but what's even greater are the characters and their situations. After a long time have I seen a film that shows this much pride in being itself and it has the most awkward of storyline.<br /><br />Christina Ricci gives an absolute knockout performance. Although I dislike Samuel Jackson, the old-man showed me who's boss in this film. Excellent performances. Great emotion.<br /><br />Black Snake Moan is about a diseased girl beaten up black and blue starving from sex-addiction. An old alone black man somehow starts taking care of her. The screenplay is unpredictable and some scenes will give you the jitters.<br /><br />It has it's own sense of what I would call \\"cringe humor\\" but it's also a seriously good drama old man Eastwood would be proud of.<br /><br />Overall Rating - 8/10<br /><br />For people who liked this film, try watching \\"Monster\\"
B0002F6AZC|3.0|\\"Creepshow 2\\" **1/2 out of ****  \\"Creepshow\\" was a classic horror film because of it's originality and teaming of Stephen King and George A. Romero creating a feel of the 1950's EC horror comics. \\"Creepshow 2\\" is definitely not a classic, but it manages to carry a little bit (but not enough) of that feeling. The stories aren't as well constructed or concieved, but that doesn't mean they're not enjoyable.  \\"Ol' Chief Woodenhead\\" **1/2 out of ****  Starring George Kennedy; A kindly old couple who own a general store are robbed and murdered by three thieves, but the Indian statue outside their store comes to life and seeks revenge. A standard revenge story made better by the presence of George Kennedy.  \\"The Raft\\" ***1/2 out of ****  The best of the three stories! Two couples are trapped on a raft on a secluded lake being stalked by a man-eating oil slick-like creature (kind of like the love child of Jaws and The Blob) in the water. It's terrorfying and creative with a great twist ending.  \\"The Hitch-Hiker\\" *** out of ****  Starring Lois Chiles with an appearance by Stephen King as a truck driver; The second best story here. A cheating wife is on her way home from a late night session with her lover when she hits a hitch-hiker in the road. She decides to make it a hit and run, though as she drives further away, she wrestles with her conscience about it aloud. Would she get away with it? Is the man dead or alive? Should she turn herself in? Then her conscience begins to haunt her in the form of the dead hitcher who keeps coming back saying \\"Thanks for the ride, lady!\\" It is chilling at first but becomes a bit redundant and predicatable.  The big problem with \\"Creepshow 2\\" is it's too shot at only three stories instead of five. Also \\"Creepshow 2\\" might have been better if it were directed by George A. Romero as the original. Still, it is an enjoyable movie and ownable only as a companion piece to the original.
0312330537|5.0|This novel has made me fall in love with India...    After I finished reading it, I googled everything about both the novel and the author.  I've read some of the poorer reviews and it makes me cringe.  I find Gregory David Roberts a fascinating man who, as often mentioned in the novel, did many wrong things for the right reason.  I'm not supporting his life of crime, but I really believe that this is a once in a lifetime discovery that should be treasured and valued.  I have fallen in love with all of his characters and the language of the novel.  I really encourage any person with a passion for reading to delve into this novel and get lost in its heart-wrenching splendor.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|If you're a Beatles fan, you pretty much have to own this album. Unless you're a Beatles purist and don't like hearing the original tunes remixed and messed with in any way. But trust me, the mixes are very interesting and in some cases improvements on the original, seamlessly meshing from one track to another without breaks, sometimes even blending 2 or 3 classics together in a fascinating way. George Martin and the remaining Beatles had a hand in the album, so you know they weren't going to allow any schlock. The reason I didn't give it five stars and title my review \\"Absolutely classic\\" is because, unfortunately, only about 2/3rds to 3/4ths of the album are new remixes. The rest of the tunes sound like the originals or directly from the Anthology CDs (not necessarily a bad thing). I wanted the entire album to be original. That said, I have no regrets about buying this album. Go for a drive on a sunny day and listen to it from start to finish...you won't be disappointed.
0375805613|5.0|I loved this book when I was little and had to buy it for my one year old.  It's a classic.  Love it.
B000002UB3|5.0|Not only is this one of the best albums of all time, by one of the (if not THE) best bands of all time, I defy anyone to name a better album  side (by ANY artist) than the B side of Abbey Road. This album was a favorite of mine growing up and here I am at 38 and it is still a favorite. Classic.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this movie!  I think it is better than the book.  The characters are beautiful.  I watch it every chance I get.  It has that deep love that makes your heart pound.  It's one of those movies that you don't want to end.
B000P2A24W|4.0|I was hesitant to buy this CD at first because I was afraid that only one song would be good and the rest wouldn't be.  It turns out that this CD is more mellow than other Bon Jovi CDs but it's also more original which I love.  I find myself listening over and over to this in the car and love it.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is a Bon Jovi fan.  I also like the fact that the group has matured with their age which is refreshing.  They don't try to be 25 eternally like some bands.  EXCELLENT.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|This is good but not as great as Breakaway. I love Kelly Clarkson though. She is a naturally tallented singer. I suggest that she concentrate on the type of songs she is adept in. She can sing inserts if she wishes. By this I mean she can do the way Michael Jackson does. He is a pop singer but in his CD he can sing rock or R&B.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Oh my, my, my.  If watching these boys every Thursday night wasn't enough, they had to go and put them out on DVD! I think I broke the pause button on the remote, and now I've moved towards the pause button on the DVD player itself!  Can everyone say -slow motion!  What a treat for me (birthday gift) and now my fiance understands what all the hub-bub is all about.  He enjoys the storyline (great fights and gorgeous girls), and I enjoy the good looks and charm (of the main men, of course)!  He was able to catch up, so when we watched Season 2, he was all set.  Now I wait patiently for Season 2 to come out! (I think I need to invest in a new DVD player..I hear Christmas is coming soon....hmmmmm).
0316067598|5.0|Excellent book - this true account story of this brave Navy Seal gives me hope and inspiration in a troops - this book made me proud to be an American!!
B000001FN1|5.0|Listening to them back in the 80's was totally spectacular. Doro proved that she was and still is to this day a female vocalist to be reconed with. As for the band outstanding. I just wish the group from triump and agony album would get back together and do a North American tour.  Yes I still live in the 80's but hey that was music. wherever you are Doro , I wish you continued success.
B000002H33|5.0|Probably, you´ve heard a lot of this album. I can tell you all the goods that it contains, the all time classics, the fact that it has not even one filler-song, that is simply perfect.... but I rather tell FACTS. My praise I will keep for my own.  *First, for all Metallica true fans, this is their best work, leaving behind its other highlights.  *When this album was released in 1986, reached number 29 in USA, this list including all kinds of music, not just metal. By this time, Metallica was already an excellent band, but still in the underground league.  *\\"Master\\" is frequently being tagged by critics as \\"one of the most influential heavy metal albums of all time\\".  *TIME magazine named \\"Master of Puppets\\" NUMBER ONE in the list of the 100 greatest albums of all time.  *Metallica were ranked by MTV the 3rd \\"Greatest Heavy Metal Band in History\\", and is listed at #5 on VH1's \\"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\\"... so, what would you expect from their best album?  *In Kerrang! magazine during 2006, three of Metallica's albums appeared in the \\"100 Greatest Rock Albums Ever\\" list: Master of Puppets was number two.  *Finally, the song \\"Master of Puppets\\" is never ignored in ALL respectable lists of top 10 best heavy metal songs ever, frequently being rated the best heavy metal classic of all time. This particular song is beyond excellence. Almost 9 minutes without a second of waste. From the first blow, passing through the almighty chorus, the mind-blowing solos and ending in the final laughter samples, this is just a trip to another universe.    Master of Puppets is just timeless. It is easily the corner stone of every metal collection. I write this lines because besides the well-earned praise of critics and fans, I will forever be in debt with this CD. It gave me countless rocking moments every time I heard it in this long 15 years. And it still does. From head to toe. Here, my tribute exposing FACTS. Hope this was useful to you.
0375505091|4.0|In previous reviews on this book, I was put off.  I think they were written by people who had wanted to purchase a book with slick commercial images and information as to how to recreate them.  But the title of this book is exactly what it is and the whole production of it is excellent.  It is a definite window into the life of Annie Leibovitz, colored with beautiful and real photographs of her surroundings and people in her life, as well as including some of her well known commercial images.  An inspiring read and a quality hardback book.  All in all, a very worthwhile purchase.
B00005JPMZ|4.0|Yes I went to the movies to see this, and I read in another review that the reviewer commented the kids with their cell-phones. I have to agree with you 100%. Other than the few kids that had their parents with them, I was the only person over the age of 10 in the theater. Which resulted in an hour and a half of seat kicking, screaming, whining, popcorn throwing kids, ruining a good movie. but as far as the movie goes, its really good. I remember the comic books, the cartoons, and the live action movies from the 90's and if it was teenage mutant ninja turtles, it kicked @$$. And being a fan of that I had to see the new one, and I was pleased with it except for the theater experience.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|New York football hero Flash Gordon along with the beautiful Dale Arden are kidnapped aboard Dr. Hans Zarkov's experimental rocket-ship. Trapped inside the rocket-ship as it begins its ascent into space, the unlikely threesome are sucked into the magnetic pull of the planet Mongo, ruled by the ruthless Emperor; Ming the Merciless. It seems that Emperor Ming has been toying with the Earth’s climate, causing unnatural disasters while planning to destroy the Earth. When Zarkov’s rocket-ship lands on Mongo they are captured and taken to the palace of Ming. As soon as the Emperor sees Dale Arden he plans to make her his concubine. Will Flash Gordon be able to unite the opposing kingdoms of Mongo to stop Ming from destroying the Earth? Will he be able to save Zarkov and Dale as well as himself? You’ll have to buy your own copy to find out how it ends.  Why does Universal Studios continue to skimp on their releases?  For the money I spent on this all new &#34;Flash Gordon&#34; saviour of the universe DVD edition, I feel completely cheated. I'll admit that the front cover artwork and disc design are really cool. However the disc packaging is absolutely terrible and an extremely cheap effort from Universal Studios. I found that the disc was seated so tight inside the holder, making it extremely hard to remove from the package and at one point I was afraid it was going to snap.  The good news for fans of this movie is that the newly re-mastered video transfer is excellent and the colors are incredibly sharp and vibrant to say the least. In my opinion the awesome soundtrack performed by Queen is what made this movie. I'm no sound expert but in my opinion the re-mastered  5.1 Dolby Digital surround soundtrack is inconsistent throughout the movie. The sound levels are definitely off and I expected the sound to be better.  The bonus features included are very lame, to say the least. The SCI-FI channel trailer for the new Flash Gordon TV show is a complete waste of time andit adds nothing to this release. Sadly they're aren't any commentaries from any of the actors and that's a major disappointment for me. It would have been nice to hear comments from Sam Jones, Melody Anderson, Topol, Timothy Dalton or some type of cast look back featurette should have been included. I don't understand why Universal couldn't reach out to some of the actors to provide some sort of commentary for this release.  I'd be willing to bet this film was a riot to make and there must have been plenty of bloopers and extras during filming, so why weren't they included? I've always liked this movie and rate it five stars for pure fun, but at the same time I'm very disappointed in the way Universal Studios has packaged and released it to the fans. A cult classic like &#34;Flash Gordon&#34; should have received the deluxe DVD treatment filled with all the extras.  The Cast: Sam J. Jones…..Flash Gordon  Melody Anderson…..Dale Arden  Max Von Sydow…..The Emperor Ming  Topol…..Dr. Hans Zarkov   Ornella Muti…..Princess Aura  Timothy Dalton…..Prince Barin  Brian Blessed…..Prince Vultan  Peter Wyngarde…..Klytus   Mariangela Melato…..Kala   John Osborne…..Arborian Priest  Richard O'Brien…..Fico  John Hallam…..Luro   Philip Stone…..Zogi, the High Priest   William Hootkins…..Munson   Bobbie Brown…..Hedonia   Ted Carroll…..Biro   Adrienne Kronenberg…..Vultan's Daughter  DVD Bonus Features: * Alex Ross, Renowned Comic Artist, on Flash Gordon - Learn how Flash Gordon influenced this legendary artist, both personally and professionally * Writing a Classic: Screenwriter Lorenzo Semple, Jr. - Meet the man who wrote the screenplay that would live on as a cult favorite * Flash Gordon 1936 serial episode: Planet of Peril * Flash Gordon SciFi Channel TV show trailer-  * Theatrical Trailer

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Yes, this is NO \\"Breakaway\\".  Big deal.  I don't buy cd's of my favorite artists to hear them remain \\"pigeon-holed\\" into what made them popular.  I whole-heartedly HATED the cd prior to \\"Breakaway\\" and was thankful she changed her style after that dreck! I want to hear artists spread their wings and try new things.  Her voice alone is what made me pick up \\"My December\\".  I for one certainly did not want a \\"Breakway\\" rehash. This is what Kelly has done, and she has done it well.  Good for her for taking a stance in what she believes.  Will this affect her record sales????  Maybe to some degree.... but who cares.  She still has a major career ahead of her.  One thing that does kinda make me scratch my head is the choice of releasing \\"Sober\\" as the follow-up single to \\"Never Again\\".  I find this a surprisingly weak choice as the second single from the cd.  This is my least favorite offering on the cd.  There were WAY better (stronger) choices for a second single than this song.  I fear that this choice alone could put a crimp in the momentum of album sales. (I know I almost sound as if I am contradicting myself in regards to album sales, but afterall, I still want Kelly to do well!)   My only gripe with the entire cd is the bizarre appearance of the song \\"Chivas\\" one full minute AFTER \\"Irvine\\" ends....still considered part of the 13th track??? Why not just make that the 14th track and be done with it?  Bottom line: GO BUY THIS CD.......it will quickly become a favorite!  Highlights for me:  \\"Be Still\\", \\"Irvine\\", \\"Never Again\\".....many more!

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie and are at all into action, pick it up.  It's one of the coolest movies of the past few years.  Even if you don't like the plot, you'll enjoy the slick effects (CG done right for a change) and wicked action.  It's gory, so send the kids to bed early.  If you own a Blu-ray player, this is why you bought it.    In response to previous reviews, I saw no flickering or other problems.  I thought the image and sound quality were excellent. The only complaint I can really give about the overall product is the bare-bones feel of the case.  I'm used to getting a nicely polished package (double-printed label with an image on the inside of the case) and some sort of insert/chapter list.  None of that on this one.  It feels thrown together. It's nit-picky, but I appreciate the little things like that. The Blu-Ray disc itself is excellent.  The bonus features are fine.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|Its been a long time since I read the book and it was great to see that the film is such a true rendition of the book and in ways more enlightening with the clever imagery.  It is exactly what it is meant to be and that is insightful.  You'll enjoy this one and it is good for people just coming to know the energy of the Universe to really deepen their understanding with the film.
B000024RQU|5.0|Still one of my favorite Rock cd's of all time. The lyrics are not dated and the sounds are incredible. For those who are unfamilar with this album it was created before Supertramp became a top 40 band. Enjoy.

B0000A98ZP|5.0|If you have teens in you house, make sure they see this flick.  Ok, so there is some strong language but don't kid yourself, they know it already.  What this film has to say about the teenage condition, school, teachers and parents should not be missed.  It should be required viewing for all in-coming high school freshman.  Brilliant performances by all, a great cast, and a sterling view of what it is like (what it has always been like) to be a teen and face the pressures of growing up, expressing your individuality, coping with who you are, and learning to live, love and accept others for what they may be.    Ironically, everyone will walk away understanding how misunderstanding they have been of high school kids.

B0000C8AVM|5.0|Thank you, Bob Dylan.  Not to sound too sentimental, but I can't imagine a universe without this wonderful music in existence.  Tangled Up in Blue is truly a work of art, a stream of consciousness song, a trip through Dylan's psyche, a great folk tune that will live on long after Bob is gone.  The rest of the album is pretty much a trip through the last days of Dylan's marriage; confessional, painful songs like Idiot Wind, Simple Twist of Fate, Buckets of Rain, Shelter from the Storm (a great piece of poetry disguised as a \\"rock song\\")...with a few songs to break up the intense confessional tone.  I would take this with me to a deserted island, listen to it over and over again, and find something new every time.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has followed up his smashing deput, The Kite Runner, with an almost equally compelling and lovely second novel.  A Thousand Splendid Suns is sure to be named one of the best books of 2007.  I couldn't put it down.  After finishing the book in less than two days, I was sad to say goodbye to the characters. Although some friends I know have found certain parts of the story to be disturbing, I would not let that dissuade any readers. I highly recommend this book.

B000OVLBFS|3.0|After CBS aired \\"Stone Cold\\" in 2005, the ratings response prompted a series of TV movies. So, for the second entry, CBS went back to the beginning and adapted \\"Night Passage,\\" Robert B. Parker's novel that introduced Paradise, Massachusetts police chief Jesse Stone.     In \\"Night Passage,\\" we see a very different Stone from the first movie. In this prequel, he leaves Los Angeles after being fired from the police due to his alcoholism. His wife has left him, and booze seems to be the only thing getting him through his pain. And he arrives in Paradise as the hand-picked replacement for the outgoing police chief by an unscrupulous businessman who doesn't want a strong law presence in town. He's sadly mistaken and misjudges Jesse.    Like the other films in the series, \\"Night Passage\\" surrounds star Tom Selleck with a dynamite supporting cast. Saul Rubinek, Stephanie March, Stephen Baldwin, Mike Starr, Viola Davis and the underappreciated Stephen McHattie all provide support. The acting is not the problem with \\"Night Passage,\\" but the story is weak.    Maybe because the paramilitary, white supremacist storyline from Parker's book is ejected in favor of a money laundering scheme, but there's no mystery or suspense to be found here. Jesse suspects Hasty Hathaway from Day One, and he knows Joe Genest is involved with the mob. Besides, Joe doesn't make for a good menace because Jesse kicks his butt within five minutes of meeting him.    The strength of the piece lies with Selleck, who turns in a tour de force performance as a man who is trying to hold on to the last chance he's got in life. Recently, Selleck was nominated for an Emmy for his performance as Stone in \\"Sea Change,\\" and it's nice to see these films and Selleck getting their due.    Is it a bad movie? No, but it is not as good as \\"Stone Cold\\" or \\"Death in Paradise.\\" I would recommend this one for established Jesse Stone fans only. Even though it is technically \\"Chapter 1\\" of Jesse's story, it is a bad film to start with.
1582701709|5.0|\\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne is a spectacular and dazzling philosophical treatise that clearly reflects the inherent power of the mind. Of paramount importance is that Byrne makes one initial qualifying statement at the beginning of the book which I think is imperative for the reader to remember and implement when considering the precepts elucidated in The Secret.  The qualifying statement is that one must practice inner peace first before attempting to practice the rest of The Secret and manifest, through the power of thought.  Exactly what is inner peace?  Inner peace is the peace that surpasses all understanding.  Inner peace is the peace that is present no matter whether one 'gets' what one wants or not...Inner peace is the true essence of who we really are, the true nature of human nature...the True \\"I AM\\"...\\"I am neither body, nor mind, I AM the immortal Self, I AM peace in all conditions...    Once one has achieved the state of consciousness of true inner peace then one may attempt the various approaches to life transformation as suggested in The Secret by the various contributing authors.  I would suspect that many of us must remember to study more deeply into how to achieve true inner  peace before even attempting to put into practice the various precepts about manifesting higher good in one's life.    Further, I would have to say that The Secret is an extremely potent book filled to overflowing with 'secrets' within our reach, that if put into practice correctly through tapping into the power of positive thinking, will most certainly assist in us being channels for creating a better world. The Secret really is dazzling and spectacular, however practicing inner peace first is a must!!!    If you like the ideas expressed in \\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne then you'll find the following recently released books to be most enlightening:    Nexus: A Neo Novel  [[ASIN:0875168205 The Prospering Power of Love]]  [[ASIN:1577310462 Living in the Light: A Guide to Personal and Planetary Transformation Second Edition (Gawain, Shakti)]]  [[ASIN:1577311957 Practicing the Power of Now: Essential Teachings, Meditations, and Exercises from The Power of Now]]  [[ASIN:0876044909 The Seven Initiations of the Spiritual Path]]

0553260111|4.0|Just a few quick thoughts:   - The story in this book has nothing to do with the movie by the same title.   - I really enjoyed watching the movie.   - I really enjoyed reading the book.      So long as you know they're completely different stories, plots, and mostly different characters; you'll have no problem.  It's ok to view them as two different works of entertainment.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Bond is back and that is a good thing, just not a great thing. Sadly, although I too like the new Bond, the script doesn't quite hold up the fort.The usual suspects put in their appearances and we are pleased, but I for one didn't get a lot out of the supporting cast of disposable villains. They didn't quite seem up to the challenge. The fights between the professional that Bond is and the miscellaneous thugs seemed prolonged. How is it that every gun-carrying lout can defend himself like a master? Many seemed to get the best of Bond, including the sprinting messenger in the opening sequence, which was far too long and entirely improbable. I kept thinking, well, you know, they can jump and fly better and farther than Spiderman. Bond's new playmate seemed more bitchy than sexy. She was constantly giving him the feminist line but failed to deliver the goods. She hardly seemed worth resigning over, and I never believed for a minute that he would fall in love with her. All of this is the fault of the script. Now that we've got a new Bond, let's get a new screenwriter.
B00005JPQT|4.0|This isn't a classic movie.  One does not go to see a Die Hard movie expecting to see an Academy Award caliber film.  And with all action films these days, the bounds of credibility are stretched many times simply to outdo current standards of stunts and special effects.  However, for what it is, Live Free or Die Hard is a great action movie and the best film of the franchise since the original.<br /><br />I remember seeing Die Hard the weekend it opened and being totally captivated by it.  I was 18 and since then I have probably seen the original at least 15 times -- each time being incredibly entertained.  The subsequent Die Hard films were mediocre attempts to cash in on the success of the original.  I was originally expected not much better from this version, but was pleasantly surprised and felt that McClane returned to his gritty ex-NYC cop persona that appealed to fans of the original.<br /><br />Everyone knows how the movie is going to end, the key question going into LFODH was whether or not there was enough plausibility and dimension to an action plot and how well Willis could reprise what had become a stale and tired character.  In my estimation, none of the above was a disappointment.  Of course, the 18 wheeler being shot by the fighter jet while the highway comes crashing down, all the while Willis maintains control is beyond far-fetched -- needless to say, Willis hanging on to the fighter jet is insane.  All that notwithstanding, the movie is a fun, exciting and enjoyable ride.  As presumably the last movie in the franchise, it is a worthy conclusion.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|Folk/blues/rock mix, like Led Zep?  Yeah thats right!  A couple of tunes have that unmistakable blend.  Playful lyrics and wonderful howling vocalizations.  The Celtic was a bit of a surprise, but its OK standing on its own.  A goodly portion rocks HARD!  Just reaches out of the speakers, grabs you by the shirt and hollers in your ears like a vein popping Catholic nun!  These guys are music artists whose pallet is a bed of icy granite.  Picture a brittle hard coastal seashore and imagine waves pounding this jagged rock wilderness as it stands resilient sharp and unmoved washed clean and quiet.  Pound on that drum girl!  Keep the faith!  My first WS album.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  Abigial Breslin shines as does everyone else.  Yes, this family was/is dyfunctional but pulls together in the end.  If you don't get it....well, I guess you just don't get it.  I am glad I did.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Having read a few of the lengthy and eloquent reviews, I'll just make a few comments.  I've played guitar seriously for over 30 years and have been a prog-head since the early 70's.  If I had to choose one desert island album, this would be it.  The originality and sheer depth of musicality, spirituality and emotion contained in this album is breathtaking.      For the average kid reared on MTV and the plethora of b.s. music filling the airwaves, this album (as for much of 70's prog-rock) would be a very hard listen.  It was tough for alot of people to comprehend when it was initially released.  Still, one can only hope that music like this will not be forgotten as the din of hip-hop and Emo continues unabated.  Comparing Topographic Oceans to a hip-hop song is like comparing the Mona Lisa to stick figures, and that's being kind (mind you, I do try to keep an open mind. Two bands of the noughts that I actually like are System of a Down and The Strokes).    Re: Alan White's playing, I think his drumming is astounding on Tales; I don't think Bruford could've done better.    Finally, although my faith in a benevolent deity has sadly dwindled over the years, albums like Tales preserve what little faith I have left.  How can music so profoundly beautiful have been created in a random, godless universe?
B000MXPE88|5.0|Not the typical spy movie, more a beautifully directed intense psychological drama.  Flashback: The six year old Edward Wilson watches his father prepare to commit suicide, although at that moment the boy doesn't realize it. His father discovers him, sends him away, closes the door and shoots himself. This traumatic experience ironically prepares Edward for a career in the CIA. It will take him around the globe, far away from home, maybe even away from his soul...  Edward (wonderfully portrayed by Matt Damon) is almost unable to show his true feelings. He talks very little, gives up his true love to stay with the woman who will give birth to his son (marvelous: Angelina Jolie).   For all of his life he will sacrifice everything around him to serve his country. It is all he has.   When, after the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he is asked to find the mole in the organization, he begins to realize there is not anyone he can trust, never was. Not his father, not his university teacher, not his so-called friends, not even his super.   There might have been loved ones who could have saved him from all his internal misery: his first love, his wife, his son. But it is too late. He  cannot trust and there is betrayal all around. It becomes clear that he  never got over that terrible shock when he entered the room and found his father lying dead on the floor.  A wonderful film about fate and the choices we all make, where they lead us and what might have been had we taken another road...  The images are perfect, the actors magnificent, Robert De Niro's directing superb. A very complex must have to watch over and over again.  As to the length of the movie. I just noticed other reviewers had a problem with that. Not me. I never got bored for a second. I never even got pulled away from the storyline. Sure, it is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but I didn't realize it until the credits started rolling.  As always (well, almost) the HD DVD's images are brilliant and the combo disc includes 16minutes of deleted scenes (in HD), picture in picture access.
0316067598|5.0|An outstanding book. Every adult or teenager over 14 should be required to read it. Sucn an insight on the battles going on over there and we are so unaware. I had tears in my eyes after just the first few pages. I don't read this type of book as a rule but this is one of my favorite books!    What an outstanding young man!!!!
B000007ODL|4.0|A guaranteed quality experience. Guaranteed as I had nearly all the songs already.   The common fault in J.J.Cale's songs is the lenght - the shortness to be more specific. You just start to enjoy and then the song ends. Perhaps the tracks should have been also digitally lenghtened not only re-mastered :-)

B000H0MKGK|5.0|For a few people this may be a departure from his previous work, but  Mayer pulls it off quite nicely with a more blues oriented sound.  Desperately wanting to shed his pop/rock image, he achieves a happy medium, still making music you can chill or groove to.  Top to bottom this album is an easy listen. Gravity, Vultures, I Don't Trust Myself, Heart of Life, Dreaming with a Broken Heart and my personal favorite Belief make this album an instant classic.   This man can do no wrong, and is a legend in his own time.  He could probably make an R&B album and it will still sell.  I saw him at Philips Arena last week and he puts on an amazing show and I came away impressed by his guitar skills.  I know I can't wait to see what he does next.
B000JRYOPG|4.0|I wasnt expecting to much of this movie but it turned out to be really good. Ky-Mani and Spragga did a great job imo. Its kind of like a Jamaicanized Belly. Everyone has already told you what its about so I'll skip all that but I really enjoyed this movie and ended up buying it
B000MXPE74|5.0|I love this CD!   I bought it with two other CDs and find myself always wanting to listen to this one instead of the others.     If you like Hot Hot Heat, I think this band has a similar vibe. Good new rock music that isn't screaming!  yea!
0060987464|3.0|\\"The less people understand you the more intelligent they think you are\\" muses Marilyn. In a catch 22 kind of way the understanding of Brian Warner I've gained from this book supports his claim.   I at least think he's less compassionate than I previously did, if not less intelligent. He talks seriously about planning to murder an unstable girl who was harassing him after he led her on then dumped her and kicked her out of the band, plans he was only scared off completing because a homeless man started following him and his accomplice while they were on their way to do the deed and after failing to lose him a cop car happened to pass by.   Learning about some of the experiences that inspired his lyrics and performance I can look at them and say yeah that's a good way of expressing that, but previously it was hard to see much meaning in anything he wrote or did. Yet he claims that conservatives were trying to silence him because of what he was saying. Dude, people liked you or disliked you based on image, no one knew you were saying anything.   His comraderie with Anton Lavey, who is portrayed (presumably unintentionally) as a fortune-telling conman, illuminates Manson's worst trait, his willingness to see only the worst in his conservative christian detractors, seeking to villify rather than enlighten them, denying their humanity in the same way they do his.   He also subscribes to a \\"contempt for the weak\\" ideology typically expressed by white supremecists, involving disgust for sluts and drug addicts, and advocates the death penalty for shoplifters \\"because if you're stupid enough to get caught you deserve to die.\\"   His jaded attitude to \\"sex, drugs and rock n roll\\" culture inspires some repellant descriptions that could probably do a better job of turning kids off it than any parental warnings or PSAs.   The commitment he maintained to his artistic vision in the face of difficulty in getting his short stories and poetry published, finding people committed to hismusical endeavors, and in-band politics is inspiring.   At it's core the book is about how he felt and as an overview of his most emotionally significant moments I don't think he's holding anything back.

B000P46QIG|5.0|Having fairly recently become a BIG fan of Porcupine Tree and having been a BIG jazz fusion and progressive rock fan for the last 30 years or so I have been seeking out other bands who are successfully merging my three favorite genres of music (while metal is not on my list of favorites I do really like what Porcupine Tree does with it). Lo and behold I have discovered Planet X. This is probably the best merger of fusion and metal I have ever heard. I am also a fan of Dream Theater but don't really like the vocals too much so the all-instrumental aspect of Planet X is really appreciated. The addition of my all-time favorite guitarist, Allan Holdsworth, really adds an awesome touch to the tunes he plays on. This is not music for the faint-hearted and also not for those who view music as just background noise. This deserves serious listening. I'm looking forward to more stuff from these guys in the future.
B000001EC1|4.0|THIS CD  IS  A  MIXTURE  OF  OLD  BON  JOVI  AND  NEW  BON  JOVI.  OLD  OR  NEW  I  STILL  LOVE  IT.  I  GREW  UP  LISTENING  TO  BON  JOVI  AND  WILL  ALWAYS  LISTEN  TO  HIM.  MY  FAVORITE  SONG  ON  THIS  CD  IS  \\"LIVIVNG  ON  A  PRAYER\\".  ITS  FUN  TO  SING  AND  HAS  A  CATCHY   BEAT.  I  LOVE  THIS  CD  AND  EVERY  BON  JOVI  FAN  WILL  AS  WELL.

1579126235|5.0|First Sentence:  It was five o'clock on a winter's morning in Syria.<br /><br />In the Orient Express Calais Coach, a wealthy American is found dead of multiple stab wounds.  The train is stopped in the snow and it quickly becomes clear the killer is still on board.  Monsieur Bouc, the director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits, asks his friend, and fellow passenger, M. Hercule Poirot to solve the case.<br /><br />It had been about 25 years since last I'd read Dame Agatha but I now remember just how good she was.  Her dialogue is flawless; it flows in the natural style of conversation, particularly multi-lingual conversation.  I'm reminded, too, that her books were written in a time when the middle- and upper-class English had, and may still have, a rudimentary understanding of French so no translations were made in the story.  Her humor is light and deft.  Her characters, Poirot particularly, are fascinating representatives of certain classes of the time.  Her clues are deftly placed and it such fun to watch Poirot engage his \\"little gray cells.\\"  Dame Agatha is definitely deserving of the term \\"classic.\\"  I'll not wait another 25 years before reading another of her books.
1582701709|5.0|I first received a copy of the book from the library, being #98 on a list of 136.  I have found that I personally need to read each chapter several times and let the words sink in.  I keep a notebook of the things I want and believe,  know this sounds strange, that I have reached a positive thought basis.  I refer to certain chapters whenever I feel I'm wandering away from a positive thought process.
0316018953|4.0|First Sentence:  The call came at midnight.<br /><br />LA Detective Harry Bosch has been called out to a murder scene; the first case with his new, young partner and one that reunites him with his former lover, FBI agent Rachel Walling.  The case quickly becomes a multi-agency investigation as the victim was a doctor with access to radioactive substances.  When they find the wife tied up and her picture sent to threaten the husband, the Feds suspect a possible terrorist plot and try to freeze Harry out of the investigation.  But to Harry, it's a murder first.<br /><br />There is less character development in this book than normal as it started as a serialized novel in the paper.  But the story doesn't lack for action.  I liked that the action took place in a very compressed location and time period.  I enjoyed the twists in the plot and didn't see the end coming.  Even in a shorter, less dense story, Connelly still delivers a darn good book.
B00000IFWE|4.0|The more I listen to this underrated gem, the more I appreciate it. Some Tom Petty albums just get better with age.
0375714669|3.0|This book continues where Persepolis left off with Marjane returning home from Austria to attend college. She's returning home to witness the aftermath of the war. The novel wasn't as good as the firs for it focuses on her college relationship with her boyfriend, and basically has a lot of boring parts to it. But, it's a decent followup
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Die hard linkin park fans (most anyway) are going to ignore how terrible this album really is. I've always like linkin park music, hybrid theory was good and meteorea to. It is good to experiment with your musical style, look at nine inch nails with the hit Year Zero. Yet, a lot of the mixing and sounds on the album are just plain stupid. There are some reasons to like this album. Given Up is a good track, and honestly What I've Done is a nice alternative rock song. The \\"classic rock, hip-hop\\" feel is not here at all though. The songs Bleed It Out and Hands Held High are two of the most ridiculous songs the band as even thought up. They had a good thing going with Qwerty if they had built an album around that.

0345448898|3.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW.  I've only read the Golden Compass; and liked it, mostly.  It is well-written, the world that Mr. Pullman creates and populates is imaginative, and the story is complex and layered enough to be engrossing.  But it's only 3 quarters of a good book, and I dropped my rating from 4 to 3 stars.  It's to be expected that, as the heroine and focus of the story, Lyra has the knack for devising appropriate and effective responses to the desperate situations into which she is thrust.  But her trickery of the bear king was extrordinarily contrived.  Enough so that I almost stopped reading the book.  Yes, I know that Mr. Pullman explains why she was able to pull it off, but I just didn't buy it.  The story just got weaker from that point.  I did like the complexity surrounding her relationship with her father, but the race to save Roger at the end was strangely devoid of emotion. I mean, Lyra is certainly described as distraught, but it just didn't come across effectively.  Nor did the bizarre episode between her father and her mother at the end (another good idea wasted).  To top it all off, the opening of the bridge seemed almost like an afterthought.    I'm certainly going to move on to the next book.  It took the second Harry Potter book to really get me hooked, and the same thing may happen here.    UPDATE:    Ok, I'm done with the Amber Spyglass.  Sadly, my earlier impressions have been confirmed.  Mr. Pullman is, technically, a good writer and has some very interesting ideas, but his story-telling is inconsistent.  As a result, I was engaged by some passages (sometimes very engaged), but frequently found my mind wandering; and when your mind is wandering in the middle of the pivotal battle scene in the final book, then something's wrong.  For me, part of the problem was his use of multiple worlds.  What starts out as a mysterious and heretical concept in Book 1, ends up rapidly becoming a crutch.  So many locales get introduced that none of them are effectively developed and all seem 2-dimensional (with the possible exception of Lyra's world in Book 1, and that's pretty much left behind).  Worse, character development ended in Book 1, with the exception of Ms. Calder; and while Mr. Pullman took her character in an unexpected and interesting direction, it wasn't convincing (when the angel Regent -- what'shisname -- delves into the depths of her soul, she's somehow able to keep him from seeing her love for her daughter?  Once again, I didn't buy it).  The only two characters in the series that I developed some affection for are Lyra's daemon and Mr. Scoresby (and his daemon, so make it three).    As for the big attack on religion, all I can say is *yawn*.  Mr. Pullman manages to take an interesting idea (in this case, borrowed from some early Christian sects) and drain the excitement and mystery out of it.  Turns out that living for thousands of years, having a hyperdimensional existence, and being able to delve into peoples souls doesn't really convey any tactical or strategic advantage.  Angels are just another bunch of guys from down the street.  The death of \\"God\\" was extraordinarily anti-climactic, and the subsequent death of the angel Regent (and putative chief architect of human misery) wasn't much more compelling.  And don't get me started on the world of the dead thing, or on the \\"sacrifice\\" Lyra and Will are asked to make.  The fate of all intelligent life across all worlds depended on that?    OK, so now I sound like I disliked it more than I did.  Sorry about that.  Sometimes you get started on these things and then only remember the parts that disappointed you.  This is a decent, 3-star story, but the best part of the series, by a substantial margin, is the first 3/4s of The Golden Compass.
0743454537|5.0|This is one of the best books that I've read. Every chapter is written from the point of view of a different character which I found to be a nice change from the usual book. I highly recomend this book!
B0000640SB|5.0|After gaining box office and critical praise for his work in the smash hit \\"Independence Day\\", actor Will Smith was riding high as one of Hollywood's newest box office sensations. So, what does someone in that position do for a follow-up performance, perhaps something small, maybe an independent feature or something of the sort...on second thought, that wouldn't be Will Smith's style, so what did he do to follow-up his big screen success? Well, he went on to co-star alongside Tommy Lee Jones (\\"The Fugitive\\") in director Barry Sonenfeld's surprising sci-fi comedy hit \\"Men in Black\\".    \\"Men in Black\\" is the story of a secret government organization whose job is to monitor and police extraterrestrial activity on Earth. Their agents are chosen from the best that government training has to offer, they work in secret, and most likely you'll never even know they existed. But when an NYPD detective (Will Smith) encounters an alien, he finds himself cast into the middle of an alien war that the 'MIB' are trying to prevent from spilling over onto Earth. With the help and training of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), this former cop is about to get a crash course in what it means to be the last line of defense against the worst scum of the universe.    Now, here is a case where a movie gets released and catches everyone off guard. Upon its release there were not too many people that knew much about \\"Men in Black\\", there were some that were aware of the little-known comic book, but most just thought it looked like a funny movie with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith against a bunch of aliens. More than likely the film would prove to be entertaining and possibly worthy of owning later on, but nothing all that original. Boy, were we wrong or what? \\"Men in Black\\" was incredibly entertaining, from the action to the sci-fi to the hilarious comedy spread throughout, there was never a dull moment in this movie, and the box office returns and praise from both audiences and critics were proof ofjust how good this movie truly was.    The performances by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were enjoyable, their banter/bickering was always fun to listen to, and still is even after multiple viewings. Linda Fiorentino (\\"The Last Seduction\\") and Vincent D'Onofrio (\\"Law and Order: Criminal Intent\\") were excellent in their supporting roles, especially Vincent who was spectacular, and even creepy as an alien hiding out in a decaying human body. A few brief appearances by Rip Torn as the head of 'MIB', Zed, provided some humorous moments, especially in the scenes with the aliens known as the 'worm guys'.    The story for \\"Men in Black\\" was probably the most surprising aspect of the movie, it was a rather basic plot wrapped in a very original package of a government organization tracking aliens hiding among us here on Earth. It's refreshing to see a movie where the writers were able to take a plotline that has been used many times over, the aging veteran must train a new partner who in turn becomes his replacement, and place it into a story that is full of energy, action, humor, and originality making for an incredibly enjoyable movie experience that audiences will want to go through again and again.    If you enjoy action comedies or science fiction films then here is a movie that should entertain you from start to finish. Aside from a little bit of language and a few gross scenes that may scare younger viewers, this is a movie that for the most part the entire family can sit down and enjoy, if nothing else it seems to be aired regularly on TV so you can always see the slightly edited version without the grossness and language.    \\"Men in Black\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.

3832791620|5.0|The pictures talk for themselves, and they're given their full importance. It's filled with whole-page pictures, which is good, because you can really focus on them and make your own guess or interpretation, and then find out more about it in the back, but also has a bit of a down side, considering that the book is really heavy, so it can get a little tiring if you have to constantly check. Nevertheless, I willingly did.
B0002YCVXI|3.0|I agree with the other reviewers that this contains excellent music, but, if you pick it up in a brick and mortar store and look carefully on the back, you'll see in small print that Sony has helpfully stated \\"The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore not all DVD and CD players will play the CD side of this disc.\\" Indeed, my Dell laptop running XP cannot read this CD. Fortunately, My Debian GNU/Linux box could rip the CD, so I will be able to listen to it on my MP3 player.    With Sony, buyer beware. As for Amazon, it's misleading to say this is an \\"Audio CD\\" in the product details section. At least Sony had the decency (or advice from their legal department) to not display the CD logo on the box.
0440241413|1.0|I bought this book and the sequel in audio in French to listen to while cleaning/exercising/cooking.  I had zero expectation going in--I didn't expect it to be deep or the writing to be inspired-- yet I was still enormously disappointed.     Becky, the main character, is shallow and completely one-dimensional.  She lies to everyone and not just the credit card companies and bill collectors but to her friends and family.  Serious lies with consequences like 'Can I borrow 20 pounds to buy a gift for my aunt in the hospital' and later 'Oh, my aunt died.'   By the way, there is no aunt.      And why is she always off-guard when someone has a normal and predictable response to one of her lies?  (for example, Luc Brandon \\"How is your poor aunt?  Becky: \\"Huh?\\"  Luc: \\"The one who is in the hospital.\\"  Becky: \\"Huh? What? Huh?  Oh, um, she died.\\")       As you can see, she's stupid.  Not just 'slow' but really, really, really dumb.  She doesn't know anything about her job and seems proud that she's a moron.  And her get rich quick schemes!  She plays the lotto and really BELIEVES she's going to win (all the while lying to her father).  She orders work-at-home kits that promise to pay hundreds of thousands for little effort, she tries a part-time job but is shocked when she is expected to WORK.    She's selfish.  She doesn't care about anyone, not her friends, not her family.  Anytime someone else is talking all she's thinking about is shopping.  She has no tolerance for other people and she constantly complains about how annoying/dumb/uncool other people are.      This book makes shopaholics look like bad people.  I'm not a shopaholic at all and I'M offended.  Don't make the mistake of thinking you will, or should, identify with Becky even if you are a big shopper.  She isn't just someone who loves to shop, she has a mental illness and basically acts the way you would expect a crackhead to act--except we're supposed to find her behavior funny or cute.    I'm strugglig to finish it.  The worst part is that I bought the sequel (Shopping à Manhattan) on audio at the same time.

B000PC1K3O|4.0|This was always my favorite Mission album.  The only problem was the poor mastering that rendered the original CD so quiet (even by 1988 standards) that it was difficult to crank.  The CD finally sounds decent with this remastered version.  Personally, I wish the guitars had been mixed a bit louder, but it was 1988.<br /><br />The album itself flows beautifully from the opener Beyond The Pale, to the closing Hymn For America.  There is certainly bombast and the ridiculous Led Zep rip-off Black Mountain Mist could've easily been left off.  But as a whole, I thought this was the peak CD, their Joshua Tree of sorts.  There was a genuine air of foreboding and danger that was never captured again.
B000021XR5|4.0|I will always hold a special place in my heart for \\"Core\\" and \\"Purple\\", the first two albums by these guys, but each album has been great, and \\"No. 4\\" is no exception. \\"Down\\" kicks off the album with a sludgy, groove-driven sound that showcases STP at their heaviest. \\"Heaven and Hotrods\\" is another rocking, grungy highlight. \\"Pruno\\" may be my favorite song on this album. \\"Sour Girl\\" is an infectious, pop-rock masterpiece. It is a clever song. Really, there isn't a bad song on the album. I still recommend starting with their first two albums, because those are classics. But you can't go wrong with any STP album. They are one of the best hard rock bands of all time.
B000QUUD60|1.0|I was very disappointed when I got this dvd set. The Special edition is excellent both sound and picturewise.     The Theatrical version is just horrible. The sound recording level is extremely low (you'll need either very sensitive speakers or a very powerful amplifier to get normal volume). Also, bass is practically nonexistent, and it's mono too. This sounds worse than old VHS versions. Picture quality is also inferior to the Special edition. All in all, the widescreen laserdisc sadly remains the best way to view the Theatrical version.    The outtakes are interesting, but they are too plagued by the very low recording level. The sound on them is much worse than on official or bootleg cd's. Picture quality varies, and is generally poor.
B000002BFZ|4.0|This came out when I was starting to get into heavier music, like hard rock and metal, right around junior high. I immediately loved the diversity of songs on this album, but happen to think that PJ's first three albums were superior.  This album has it's share of classic songs, even though they didn't get the attention of earlier stuff.  \\"Sometimes\\" is a slowly-building, mid-tempo opener.   \\"Hail,Hail\\" is one of my favorite rockers of all time.   \\"Who You Are\\" is an eastern-tinged mid-tempo single.  \\"In My Tree\\" is a fun, percussion-driven, brooding song.  \\"Smile\\" is a Neil Young-ish, groove-driven rocker.  \\"Habit\\" is probably the heaviest song on this album.  \\"Off He Goes\\" is another melodic ballad, in the vein of earlier hit \\"Nothingman\\".
B000AP04FG|4.0|I don't know how to review this movie.  It was like an action/comedy, except the funny parts weren't funny.  The action parts were, however, really good and plentiful.  The storyline was a bit all over the place for me to really sit there and find any solid enjoyment out of it.  Yet somehow, despite the unrealistic story, something about it kept me tuned in.  It must have been all the gun shooting action.  Maybe I'm getting soft at my old age, or maybe there really was something special about the movie.  Worth watching.
B0000028UK|5.0|This album has even more great songs than \\"Ten\\" does.  It has rockers like: \\"Go\\", \\"Animal\\", and \\"Leash\\".  A great rocking ballad: \\"Dissident\\"  Melodic, lighter songs: \\"Daughter\\", \\"Rearviewmirror\\" and \\"Elderly Woman\\".    All these songs add up to an excellent listening experience. There is not a bad song on this album, and even the quirkier songs have their place: \\"Glorified G\\", \\"Rats\\" and \\"WMA\\" all are fun.    This is one of the best rock albums of all time, and a must-own for anyone that likes early 90s rock. If you are growing up with bands like Nickelback, check out Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains: those bands started it all.
B000002KCV|4.0|Don't you get the feeling Neil Young was beginning to settle down as early as the late 70's when this album was released?  I probably would have been in shock if I was around back then and heard Comes a Time for the very first time.  It's constantly so relaxed and similar to many soft rock bands around during that time, and sounds like something a really older musician would create and release.  Like someone who's been around for over 30 years and was ready to settle down permanently.      Fortunately that wasn't the case, but for the time being, Neil Young wanted to focus on a soft rock album.  The title song rules (though I've heard live versions that were better) and really, the rest of the album has a similar vibe.  A quiet, mature atmosphere to the entire thing.  You could have told me \\"Lotta Love\\" was by the Orleans and I wouldn't have known the difference had it not been for Neil's distinct voice.  \\"Motorcycle Mama\\" is a pretty cool song.  I do enjoy the tunes on this album- I'm just a bit surprised Neil Young wanted to create something like this so early in his career.
B0000027RL|5.0|Check out all the hits: \\"Once\\", \\"Even Flow\\", \\"Alive\\", \\"Black\\", and \\"Jeremy\\". This is a classic album that helped instill new life in rock music and inspired many future bands. On this hard rock gem, Eddie Vedder became a legendary vocalist, as his brooding voice pours out emotion and hooks galore. \\"Jeremy\\" is one of the most angst-filled songs ever, and I think is the best Pearl Jam song, period.   The best thing is, these guys are still going strong, even 16 years after releasing this groundbreaking debut.  I highly recommend checking these guys out if you are getting into rock music. For all the Nickelback fans out there, check out these pioneers of hard rock.   I recommend starting with their early stuff: \\"Ten\\", \\"Vs.\\", and \\"Vitalogy\\".
B00004Y6O9|3.0|Van Halen's influence on the world of rock music was probably the worst one that ever happened.  Eddie Van Halen, while surely talented, never did anything for me.  His guitar solos were never memorable in the same way many hard rock bands before him were.  His style was usually played with so much speed and intensity that I always have a tough enough time even keeping up with the notes, let alone finding any enjoyment out of it.  Once Eddie Van Halen arrived on the scene, mainstream rock music overall pretty much went downhill, and has remained that way for quite some time.      However, their debut album gets some points for having a few memorable songs.  They were able to create some catchy songs from time to time such as \\"Jamie's Cryin\\" and \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\".  Another good song is \\"Atomic Punk\\".  Other songs such as their cover of \\"You Really Got Me\\" is easily inferior to the great Kinks version, and \\"Runnin' With the Devil\\" is kind of boring.  I have no idea who thought \\"Ice Cream Man\\" was worth putting on record.    Overall, their debut will never be one of my favorites compared to so many other great records from the late 70's, but it's decent enough to recommend a purchase.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Want singles and hits? You've got em.  Rockers: \\"Last Exit\\", \\"Spin the Black Circle\\", \\"Not For You\\", \\"Corduroy\\", and \\"Immortality\\"  Mid-tempo hits: \\"Nothingman\\" and \\"Better Man\\".  And even: \\"Tremor Christ\\"    This is an excellent album with everything you have come to expect from Pearl Jam. Really, their first three albums were a dynamic trilogy that will always be their best work. They have continued to make strong music, but have released more experimental stuff in recent years, and have sort of become the new Grateful Dead, in a way.     This is a must-own album for any fans of rock music, hard rock, and the Seattle sound of the 90s.
1594489505|5.0|The book is so moving in its depiction of the women of Afghanistan.  It is written with sensitivity and apparent knowledge of conditions in that country.  The women are amazingly strong and courageous in the harshest of places for their gender.  I could hardly put the book down. The author is able to tell a fascinating story that reveals great affection for the people of his native country.
B000002B2T|5.0|This was a side project of Layne Staley in the mid-90s, and it screams Alice In Chains, at least, the more acoustic side of them. Layne's voice is never better than on here, and the quirky songwriting he perfected is evident on here.   \\"River of Deceipt\\" is the single, and that is one of the best songs, with its haunting, acoustic arrangements.  \\"I'm Above\\" is the best rocker on here, and I've heard it on Syrius radio.   There are plenty of highlights on here. I would say that if you are a fan of \\"Sap\\" or \\"Jar of Flies\\" by Alice In Chains, you will love this album too.   RIP: Layne  You were the best.

B000GRUS22|4.0|As usual Michael Cretu creates a masterwork of genius.  While it is a bit of a departure from some of the other Engima albums, there are tons of elements that are pulled from past works.  If you like Enigma, then you will like this album.

0790729342|4.0|The second film of the trilogy is getting off the banality of the first one with its rape, infanticide and vengeance. Here we get to a world that is a real war to the death of one tribe against another and there is no law anywhere close. It is war for survival hence for the only thing that has some value in this desertic world where you can only move safely in motor vehicles, hence with gas. A fight for a tanker of gas, that's what the stake is. Mad Max gets on the side that controls the tanker in order to get gas for his car and he manages to serve them in a way and be accepted, though he tries to go away on his own when the service is finished. But he gets wrecked and has to be brought back by some accessory to the action who has some kind of unidentifiable flying object, some kind of ancestor of the chopper. So he will be the hero of the essential part of the film, the chase after the tanker. We will follow it with anxiety especially since a tanker like that is a bomb on wheels. The successive attacks against the tanker will be creative and some people will die on both sides and the driver will be seriously endangered by the attackers, to the point that he will not be able to avoid the final crash. And surprise, surprise, the tanker will not explode. The good old valueless gas had been transferred to the school bus in which the women were traveling. But the wreck of the tanker will incite the attackers, or what's left of them, to go away. Strangely enough they will not verify the content of the tanker and will not be able to think that the gas was somewhere else: these attackers are barbarians somewhere, hence they are intellectually retarded. And the final leg of the migration to safety could start and Mad Max could disappear in a mirage in the desert like some sand on a wind. Entertaining but in no way too intellectual: you will not get any nightmares nor headaches. Just funny after all. But that kind of chase will be imitated galore in the coming years after 1981. And that's probably one reason why it became cult: it was one of the very first films to work on the technique of shooting and editing such a chase.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne981.

B000OCXMAE|2.0|Like everyone here, I was excited when the new album was released. Hybrid Theory and Meteora were really classic albums and I thought Meteora, at the very least, one-upped Hybrid Theory. Reanimation was a good remix album but I wasn't fond of their remixes with Jay-Z. I was hoping Minutes To Midnight would bring back something that has been absent, for us fans, since 2003.    I was way off the mark. What I've Done was almost like a deception for what the album really is: a slower and softer melody by LP. What I've Done, when I listened to it, reminded me of what LP did on Hybrid Theory and I was pretty pumped by it. But I was shocked to find out that the album was on the other side of the spectrum for the two previous entries LP has done.     What I've Done, for the most part, is the only song on here in which LP continues where the left off from the previous two albums. Everything else is much more slower, mellow, and, at times, depressing. What I've Done is a good song. Leave Out All The Rest is slow but has a nice up-beat melody as it progresses and is my favorite song on the album. Valentine's Day has some nice parts to it but it doesn't work as far as melody goes.     To be honest, I found Leave Out All The Rest and What I've Done to be the only enjoyable songs on this album. Why LP decided to go more mellow this time is anyone's guess but all their fans, including myself, know them to be a band of rock mixing it up with some rap. For the most part, that is gone. I was extremely disappointed by this album considering they haven't had a true album release since Meteora (2003), which happens to be my favorite album of theirs.     Hopefully LP is not trying to change direction with this album and trying to make more mellow tunes. While some of those such songs have some decent qualities, for the most part, it just doesn't work. If anyone is considering buying this album, I suggest previewing some of the songs here or on iTunes and make your decision as to whetheror not you still want to go through with the purchase. Some of you may enjoy it thoroughly and that's okay. But if you are an LP fan that expects the style that they have been known to produce from their first two albums, like myself, you may end up being disappointed.
0316067598|5.0|I think this book should be required reading for every red-blooded American, Conservative or Liberal.  It gives a tremendous insight into the war we're fighting and how far the enemy is willing to go to slaughter EVERY LIVING INFIDEL!  More importantly, it illustrates the COMPLETE COMMITMENT our fighting forces have made to protect all of our liberty and the insane restrictions placed on them while fighting for us.  The men in this story are True American Heroes of the absolute highest order.  And yet, when a statue was erected in Colorado to honor Danny Deitz, who gave his life in our defense, some local citizens protested because the statue showed a soldier carrying a rifle.  I realize that this took place in the vicinity of Columbine High School, but wake up and smell the coffee, people.  We are at WAR and our soldiers had BETTER BE ARMED TO THE TEETH, because the enemy sure is.  To all of our troops who are fighting for my liberty, you have my undying respect and admiration.    \\"We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.\\"                                    - George Orwell

0451450523|5.0|Despite my obvious (to those who know me) passion for Star Wars and the Transformers, one movie remains close to my heart, closer even than my favorite space saga and giant robots. Animated by the same folks who brought us the old \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies, \\"The Last Unicorn\\" was a mainstay of my childhood. Even today I can almost quote the movie by heart word for word; singing or hearing the theme song performed by America (the \\"Horse With No Name\\" folks) still moves me almost to tears; hearing Christopher Lee's voice in \\"Attack of the Clones\\" will forever remind me of the pitifully twisted King Haggard. And my joy knew no bounds when, years after the rental store that carried \\"The Last Unicorn\\" closed down, a family member tracked down the DVD version for me.<br /><br />But when I learned the movie was based on a book, I decided to check out the source. After all, few books-turned-to-movies are even comparable to their source material. If my childhood movie was good, then the book had to be better, right?<br /><br />I'm happy to say that the book was indeed better... and yet the movie was so faithful to the book that it was almost a novelization rather than source material, and the film remains a classic in my mind.<br /><br />A single unicorn, guardian of a lilac wood, overhears a hunter describing her as the last unicorn. Unwilling to believe this, she leaves her enchanted home to find out the truth. Along the way, she is joined by Shmendrick, a magician whose magic is unpredictable at best, and Molly Grue, a cynical woman who is nonetheless willing to believe in the unicorn. Together, they seek out the fearsome Red Bull, which is said to serve a tyrannical king in a blighted kingdom and has chased all the unicorns to some fearsome fate. And in the course of her travels, the unicorn will taste, for the first time, the wonders of sorrow, fear, mortality... and love.<br /><br />Beagle's prose is sheer poetry from beginning to end. Unlike most authors, who may have a dozen or so outstanding lines in a work, Beagle fills The Last Unicorn with so many such lines that it's impossible to pick out one or two I think are exemplary. His work is gentle and beautiful, his characters are delightful to know, and his landscape is so vividly painted that it's almost readily visible in the mind. He has created a fairy tale, no mean feat in a day and age that generally dismisses fairy tales.<br /><br />As a child, I loved \\"The Last Unicorn\\" as a visual treat. Now, in my adulthood, I love The Last Unicorn as a last hurrah to the art of the fairy tale.s in a work, Beagle fills The Last Unicorn with so many such lines that it's impossible to pick out one or two I think are exemplary.

B00005JNQS|3.0|`Robots' didn't impress me as much as I was expecting, but on the other hand it truly is an entertaining family adventure, so it has it's plusses to accompany the minuses.  It's really nothing new, as in the storyline is nothing short of generic.  We've seen this done a million times, and quite frankly we've seen it done better, but for what it's worth `Robots' offers some great humor and an interesting backdrop for it's formulistic storyline.  The world that is created for these robots is truly mind blowing and very well thought out.  Everything from the cities themselves to the concept of child birth and child rearing is incredibly ingenious and makes for interesting topic of conversation upon the closing credits.  While some of the humor may be directed at the adult audience, it's nothing that parents would ultimately find offensive and will most likely go right over the child's head (although your children may start asking about where babies come from).<br /><br />The story is sweet, although, as I mentioned, very generic.  It's the same good guy wants to be something great and is stilted by the power hungry bad guy who he in the end overthrows.  We've seen this same scenario for almost every cartoon, and it surprises me that this was what they came up with on the story boards.  They had so many endless possibilities with the backdrop they had here and instead of exploring their depths and coming up with something as unique and ingenious as their robot world they stuck with the same ol' same that has grown tired.  Rodney, a young robot in a poor but loving household, dreams of one day being an inventor in the lines of Big Weld, the greatest robot in the world.  He leaves home and travels to Robot City in pursuit of his dream only to discover that Big Weld has been replaced by the money hungry Ratchet whose diabolical plans could mean the end of robots like Rodney and his family.  So, with the help of some dim-witted robots he plans his attack against Ratchet and his evil robot hordes.<br /><br />The animation is brilliantly done, the world a fantastic character in itself.  The voice actors are all well cast, all except maybe one.  We all know that Robin Williams is a voice over God and should be enlisted as the comical sidekick in every cartoon ever.  He doesn't disappoint here and his character Fender delivers most of the films funniest scenes.  Jennifer Coolidge is another bonus, for her voice work on Aunt Fanny is hysterical.  Greg Kinnear was a brilliant choice to play the evil Ratchet, his voice fits it brilliantly.  The not so brilliant choice falls in the line of Halle Berry, who just comes off kind of awkward.  Ewan McGregor works fine, as does Mel Brooks and the adorable Amanda Bynes whose voice just seems suited perfectly for animated work.  Here's to hoping she does another cartoon soon.<br /><br />So, in the end `Robots' is a worthwhile addition to your animated collection, and is one I most likely will buy for my daughter.  It's not one that I would readily call a masterpiece (ala `The Incredibles') but it's definitely not boring or passable.  Thanks to the brilliant work on the part of comedic genius Williams, there is much to laugh at here, and visually it's impressive.  It's sure to captivate the minds of your young ones, and thankfully it's not silly and ridiculous, at least not so much so that us parents can't tolerate it.  So, the plusses here (animation, humor and ingenious robot world) far outweigh it's minuses (that generic plot and Halle Berry) and come together to deliver an animated experience for the whole family.his evil robot hordes.<br /><br />The animation is brilliantly done, the world a fantastic character in itself.

159562015X|3.0|StrengthsFinder 2.0 is not so much a book as it is an online personality profile.  The major premise of this book is that people can take one of two avenues for success (in business, love, life, etc.), they can either focus their efforts on minimizing their weaknesses or focus their efforts on maximizing their natural strengths.  StrengthsFinder 2.0 (as one might assume from the title), advocates the latter approach and is intended to assist the reader in identifying and maximizing his strengths.<br /><br />The book is divided into two parts.  The first part is a presentation of the above mentioned thesis.  In books if this genre, one would expect a dizzying amount of anecdotal evidence; but while a couple examples are given, Rath refreshingly bucks the trend and gives the reader \\"the meat.\\"  The second part of the book is a brief description of various \\"strengths\\" (what you naturally do better than most of the population, alphabetically arranged) and tips for utilizing these strengths in the workplace.<br /><br />I'll admit that this is the only book I've reviewed that I haven't read cover to cover.  Instead, I read the introductory section and the brief descriptions of my particular \\"strengths\\" (as determined by the on-line test).  Since (for example), I don't have the \\"woo\\" strength, I don't feel competent evaluating it.  However, I found that the strengths I did score well in accurately identified where I tend to excel and described my approach to things well.  I feel that I've grown by understanding myself better and the strength-oriented advice has thus far been fruitful.<br /><br />The opening section on the premise was short and to the point.  They forcefully argue for the reader to identify and focus on his strengths yet are careful to recognize that there may exist some weaknesses that necessitate minimizing.  Their arguments are logical and compelling; I enjoyed reading it and buy into their thoughts.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, StrenghsFinder 2.0 is not so much as book as it is an online test cleverly marketed as a book.  Aside from the first section (framing the premise), the rest of the book is pretty useless.  After using the sealed code inside the book to access the online test, you receive a printer-friendly recapitulation of the \\"strengths\\" in section 2 that pertain to you.  You may only take the test once and must purchase another book to gain another access code should you want a co-worker, spouse, or other person to take it.  Like other reviewers, I had difficulty actually getting to the online test.  I imagine this is party due to my lack of computer skills, and partly due to the awkward layout of their advertised web page.  The test takes about 30 minutes, questions are timed (so that you don't think about it too much and answer the way in which your mind naturally works).<br /><br />In all, StrengthsFinder 2.0 is an excellent premise, a fine analysis of common strengths, and sound advice for persons exhibiting said strengths.  But is it really a book?  If book is defined as a series of sheets of paper with words/pictures on each page...yes, I suppose it is.  If book is defined as a logically presented, complete thesis...then it's not really a book...it's more along the lines of a thick instruction manual, telling you how to take an on-line test.  And while the premise, analysis, and advice is good, I argue that it's still incomplete.  I find myself wanting to know more about my particular strengths--theory as well as practice, anecdotal as well as statistical.  It is my hope that a follow up book (without an on-line component) is forthcoming.<br /><br />In all, I would recommend this \\"book\\" and believe it will be a great aid in leading to vocational excellence and fulfillment.ook as it is an online test cleverly marketed as a book.

B000SQKZKG|3.0|Such is typical of too many bands onstage -- drugs, pressure, envy, adrenaline, who knows what it is that causes them to practically ruin the wonders they created in the studio with abominably sped-up tempos.<br /><br />Except for \\"Tarkus.\\" This is one case where the plodding tempo of the old version is surpassed in most respects by the live rendition. Probably because they'd sped it up anyway, and had tested it on plenty of occasions before this Anaheim, Calif., show. The whole suite, including the spacey \\"Aquatarkus,\\" rocks out.<br /><br />The \\"Piano Improvisations\\" track is the other wonder on WELCOME BACK-- , and is presented for the first time on record here. As well, Keith Emerson shows plenty more piano pyrotechnics on an extended middle section of \\"Take a Pebble.\\"<br /><br />The other tracks lose out, in my opinion. I nevertheless await my copy of the remaster to give all another chance. What any good proghead would do.<br /><br />If ELP, TARKUS, PICTURES, & TRILOGY are any indication, the sound should be better than all CD pressings before this. So remaster, remaster, who's got the remaster?...<br /><br />AUG. 13: I do now! It's right up to standard with the rest of the Shout Factory releases. Noticeable is an improved bass presence.
0316067598|5.0|A gut wrenching account of true American heros. Well written and a book you won't put down untill you finish it. This is not some fictional account or some fictionalized account of real event, but a verifiable story of Americans at thier best.
B00003CXSP|4.0|I'm reviewing this movie as it stands on it's own rather than how it fits into the series.      In this installment, we meet Mason Verger, who is the sole survivor of the good Dr Lechter.  Verger is a strange character with a strange story.  His intentions are fairly clear from the outset, leaving the viewer only to watch how things unfold.      The movie remains fairly interesting throughout, as the escaped Lechter is identified and opposing forces close in on him.  The table is set, however, about an hour in when we see Lechter dispatch his first would-be apprehender with a touch of \\"historical flair\\".      Lechter and Clarice are soon after back in touch again and the time finally comes where they meet and communicate without the glass between them. So we have Verger with retribution at heart, Clarice with justice in her interest and Lechter with his usual intentions: a tasty recipe indeed, with a main course as bizarre as you will come to expect.    This is a must-see for fans of the original and fans of the series in general.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|I really didn't like Mystic River very much because I thought it moved too slow. But I had to give it \\"a big thumps up,\\" because the performances; while subtle, were believable and on target. I thought Penn's \\"Dead Man Walking,\\" performance better showcased the full range of his talent. In any event, while I didn't care much for the movie, I have to admit it was well made.
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|I popped this DVD in, hoping, it would not be the typical Hollywood leftwing film. Unfortunatetly, I was wrong. The movie is technically good. The acting is good. I just could not get over the tired leftwing plot and theme. I mean, think about how paranoid and unrealistic this movie is ! All the bad guys are white men (conservatives and neocons). All the good guys (except one) are women and Hispanics. The Hispanic FBI agent, to underline the point that the Left is the power of good in our universe, puts on a Che Guevara T-shirt at one point (mind you, Che personally had 1500 men killed, including teenagers, and hated gays and \\"artists\\"). The screenplay is full of typical Hollywood leftist lines about WMDs in Iraq, neocons, etc. To underline that the bad guys in our world are Republicans, in one scene, the bad guys meet in a room full of portraits of people like Bush Sr., Teddy Roosevelt, etc. This movie is just over the top, tired, and cliched. It is a paranoid vision of how our government works. In a post 9-11 world, I personally find it offensive to proclaim that the U.S. government is the enemy. This screenplay could have been written by Ward Churchill or Noam Chomsky. Americans need to start boycotting Hollywood. I am sick of this.     \\"There are no sides. Only haves and have nots\\". No one thinks like that. This is a cardboard version of what American conservatives think.    If Hollywood writers, directors, and screenwriters ever met real conservatives, they wouldn't have this ridiculous worldview.
B000002NC4|5.0|'perfect from now on' deserves a spot right up there w/ 'ok computer,' 'soft bulletin' 'summer teeth' and 'wowee zowee' as one of the best records of the 90's.  i bought it the night before i got my tonsils taken out, so i listened to it pretty much non-stop while i recovered.  this is the 1st bts release in my opinion that warned j. mascis that there was a challenger for the guitar god throne.  better, this album has just as much melody and catchy hooks as jaw-dropping guitar licks.  after this record, the songs started to be whittled down to a more radio-friendly time to 3 or 4 minutes (that isn't a complaint; i love the later releases too), but many of the tracks here are of epic length, and it's a testament to the quality of the material that they don't start to drag or get boring.  the bottom line is, this is one of my favorite records of all time, and i can't imagine anyone being disappointed after buying it.
0553588486|5.0|i refer not only to this book, but to all the ones that follow it!<br />I've read them all at least three times, and while I STILL get confused with all the twists and turns, i can honestly say that I have never read a better series! The characters are all so well developed that you can never be sure whether or not you love or hate them (Excpet for Cersei obviously!)and the plots and sub-plots are just mind-boggling! I've enjoyed Jordan's Wheel of Time series as well, but I feel he got a little too carried away and was marking time, george martin's book never give tyou that feeling - in fact im waiting with baited breath for the next installment!
B000002UAO|5.0|To even allow us to review this masterwork is absurd. I have nothing to say about it, it says it better than any \\"reviewer\\" could.  I'm simply submitting a review so that the star rating isn't 4 & 1/2.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Her music continues to become more mature and simply better. I can listen to this disc over and over. The songs are awesome. Much more grownup than on previous albums. She has come a long way since her debut album.
078322611X|5.0|This is a widescreen version of the movie, which I find a necessity. On two discs you get quite a few features covering the making of the movie, the field today, and the book. The feature commentary by the director and photography director is pretty good, too.<br /><br />The movie itself is highly creative and magical, hopeful and inspiring without being a heavy-duty drama. You don't have to like baseball at all to enjoy it. It's a great movie experience at a good price.
B00007BKVC|5.0|It is a chick buddy flick but done pretty well and with some nice twists and turns.  Worth watching over.
B000TFINY6|5.0|Season 3 was great.  It had a slow start for about the first 6 episodes, but it really cranked up after that.  I hope they release Season 1 and 2 on Blu-Ray also.

1596912855|1.0|I was so excited for this book; what a fun idea.  Other posters' comments are correct:  you don't really care about Jane, most of the other characters are either boring, stupid, or don't make sense.  This book was really and truly one of the worst I've read in a long, long time.  Very clunky plotting, lazy characterization, and an absolutely terrible ending.  I know it sounds fun, but it really is not!
B000065U1N|5.0|This is a very good movie.  There are intense scenes in this movie but true to life in a situation of this type.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Almost, no way they could get around the chronology.  I'm a die hard Connery fan, some Moore, but since then no one has captured the essence.  Kind of got girly towards the end but still good Bond fare for my money.  I'll have to watch it a couple of more times.
1400064287|5.0|The test of any \\"How To\\" book is how much you recall and are applying one month or more after reading the book.  In this case, I remembered the majority of Chip & Dan Heath's main points and had incorporated two of those points in my regular activities.      I have the opportunity to made formal and informal presentations on a regular basis, so the challenge of getting people to remember what I have said is important.  Therefore, I tried to see what sections of this book I could use to help me improve this ability. The two key ideas I have implemented are to (1) give concrete examples and to (2) use stories.  This has definitelly improved my presentations.    Made To Stick: Why Some Ideas Stick and Others Die presents 6 main areas that are vital to helping people remember the ideas you present.  They are Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional and Stories. The book is filled with examples that meet these criteria as well as those that don't, so one can easily see the value of the each of these elements.  I highly recommend this book to everyone who wants to make an impact on others.
B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|I have noticed that many scenes have a lot of flickering which detract from the movie experience. Unfortunately this effect does not appear to be confined to me, searching the net has displayed many other people experiencing this issue. I am starting to believe that this issue is due to a bad transfer and not a hard ware issue. I would NOT buy this disc, wait till they resolve it.
B00004RF98|5.0|I just viewed this classic motion picture about the transition from silent films to talking pictures after seeing it, albeit severely edited, in my History Of Film class. I wanted to see it uncut and enjoy it for myself. I'm so glad my mom rented the film for me.  Gene Kelly co-directed this fantastic production with Stanley Donen, in addition to starring the the film. Joining him are Debbie Reynolds (my gosh, she was absolutely gorgeous and still is), Donold O'Connor, Jean Hagen (\\"Adam's Rib\\"), Cyd Charisse and Rita Moreno (who would play the tragic princess, love-struck Tuptim in \\"Rodgers & Hammerstein's The King & I\\" and win an Academy Award in 1960 for Best Supporting Actress in \\"West Side Story.\\")<br /><br />The most popular sequence is when Gene Kelly is performing the title number in a street full of puddles; he had a 102 degree fever while filming the scen, but ever the professional, he didn't tell the producers or Stanley Donen until after he had finished filming the scene. He also choreographed the amazing dance sequences himself. My personal favorite musical numbers are \\"You Are My Lucky Star,\\" \\"You Were Meant For Me\\" and, of course, \\"Singin' In The Rain.\\" I can't stop singing it now and I love it.<br /><br />This is the way movies were made back then and, with the exception of Walt Disney Pictures and a few period films (\\"Ever After: A Cinderella Story,\\" \\"Sense And Sensibility,\\" \\"William Shakespeare's Hamlet\\" (1996), etc) the major studios in Hollywood don't make films like this anymore, which sucks. I recently wrote a paper on violence in the movies and how the graphic violence in films is causing kids to kill others (the Columbine massacre; in 1972, there was a nasty rape case in Britain that had odd similarities to a scene in \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" (a film that I never plan to see). The following is a sample of my conclusion to my paper (I got an A on it by the way, thank God).<br /><br />\\"Unless movies are based on classic literature (\\"Bram Stoker's Dracula,\\"<br />\\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,\\" etc) or a historical event (the horrible persecution of Christians in ancient Rome, the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., the sack of Rome in 1453 A.D., etc), movies with graphic violence should not be made; movies that use these things for source material only inspire interest in the literary work or historical event.\\"<br /><br />The film is rated G, though it was made before the Motion Picture Association Of America (MPAA) was established in 1968. I highly recommend this excellent picture for film buffs & dance lovers everywhere.ey's Frankenstein,\\" etc) or a historical event (the horrible persecution of Christians in ancient Rome, the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., the sack of Rome in 1453 A.D., etc), movies with graphic violence should not be made; movies that use these things for source material only inspire interest in the literary work or historical event.\\"    The film is rated G, though it was made before the Motion Picture Association Of America (MPAA) was established in 1968.

B000P1KTW8|3.0|The sessions band and Springsteen cover some of Bruce's older material recast into the old-timey style of his latest album, and surprisingly, siome of it works very well. The material that is actually folk stuff is of course done well, but a little goes a long way for fans of the Boss.     The Blu-Ray is a disappointment however. It is hard to qualify the video as being good for even a standard DVD, much less a Hi-Def offreing, with muddy blacks and grainy soft images throughout. The sound is flat and compressed, and the oom sound a little too up in the mix.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I'm one of those dinosaurs that have been following Rush since their beginnings. For some, Geddy Lee's vocals are an acquired taste - others never do complete the acquisition. Neal Peart replaced the band's original drummer John Rutsey for the band's second album and since that change, the lineup has remained stable for 32 years with Lee on bass, keys and vocals, Peart on atomic-powered drums and Alex Lifeson on guitar and vocals. To my ears, the albums and live shows improved steadliy as the 70's progressed, and by the time 1980's Permanent Waves hit, the band's audience was huge, and rightly so. After all these years, Waves is still da bomb.<br /><br />A string of excellent albums followed: Moving Pictures, Signals and Grace Under Pressure. Many hard-core fans felt that 1985's Power Windows began a long slide for the band, others heard enough strong tracks to stay happy. I found myself somewhere in the middle of those two camps, although like every loyal fan, I kept buying each new release. A few months ago, I heard that the band was about to release a new disc and go out on tour, so I asked the family if they wanted to go see the show. It was a unanimous decision, so I picked up the CD and found four tickets to the show at Red Rocks near Morrison, CO. The show was last night and it was excellent. Some Rush tunes are considered to be political by some reviewers but I've always thought that those writers were a bit off the mark. I think the band's perspectives are more anthropological and philosophical - my way of describing them are Geddylosophy, Nealosophy and Lifealosophy.<br /><br />One could argue that the new disc, Snakes and Arrows is one of Rush's best albums ever. I've been listening to it quite a bit over the last three months and it has steadily grown on me. It doesn't have the really obvious hit but instead is a cohesive and consistently strong collection. I like it all, and I like it alot. Rather than giving a song by song description, I'll just say that it needs to be listened to as a whole entity and that not all of the lyrics are obvious. Seeing the visuals at the show last night confirmed some of my suspicions. This is the most cleanly and clearly executed post-911 commentary I've heard and it is a masterpiece. Long live Rush!!! Viva Canadian art!!! These guys may be too old for rock and roll, but don't tell them - they are having way too much fun.be listened to as a whole entity and that not all of the lyrics are obvious.

B00005J7I5|5.0|Magnum Opus..what does it mean?    In its most basic translation, Magnum Opus mean \\"Great Work\\" in Latin.  \\"Great Work\\" can be taken to mean \\"Greatest Work\\".  In a musical context, a band's Magnum Opus would either be:    A) The band's most famous and most popular album  B) The band's greatest, most accomplished, highly achieved work.    To be a Magnum Opus, an album has to basically be the pinnacle of the band's creativity and intention. A Magnum Opus is usually an album of such grand scale and epic emotion that the music world is forever changed due to its presence. To be a Magnum Opus, an album has to excel far beyond  the normal confines of genre and style and transcend beyond anything created thus far.    Lateralus is Tool's Magnum Opus. It is single handedly their greatest work ever and shows Tool at their pinnacle of creativity. Now, this is not to say that Tool will never create another amazing album, but that Lateralus is the culmination epitome of their work.    Obviously with all so called \\"Magnum Opus'\\" questions are raised, such as:    What makes this particular work of art a band's Magnum Opus?    In my opinion, what makes an album a Magnum Opus:    What is so great about this album that sets itself apart from past, present and future releases?    And here, we enter into a review of Lateralus, by Tool..    Through each of Tool's release, one can get the sense of evolution.  It first started with \\"Opiate\\", a raw, gritty hard hitting album that debut Tool's sound to the world. On \\"Opiate\\" I get the sense of a human in the midst of his/her life, questioning, venting and coping with physical existence but confused and utterly lost. The lyrics deal with small glimpses of the unknown, and stark commentary on humanities present blunders and common fallacies.   The music is much more straight forward than on later releases and closely resembles traditional modern American Metal, accentuated by Danny Carey's amazing drumming and Maynard's exceptional voice.Then came \\"Undertow\\", probably Tool's most personal and definitely their darkest release. On \\"Undertow\\", the lyrics shift to more of a memoir of a person's life. The pain, the anger, the triumph and the defeat. A tale of all the experiences that molded a person to what they are. The music is a tad more complex and the first signs of a more progressive sound emerge.    Next, we were treated to Aenima, an album that revealed a completely original, evolved and progressive sound that literally shook the face of music. On Aenima, the lyrics and themes were a blend of personal memoirs and the expressed dissatisfaction with humanities current perception and attitude towards all life.  In fact, each Tool release expresses this dissatisfaction, yet on Aenima it is most prominent. An apocalyptic setting seems to encompass the themes of Aenima.    With each subsequent release, we saw Tool evolving and become more into their \\"element\\" so to speak.  Tool's first three albums reflect the darkest depths of Humanity. Pain, suffering, self-serving, searching for purpose and meaning and emotional violence are some of the more prominent themes throughout.    In 2001, the world was treated to \\"Lateralus\\", and it changed the face of music.  Technically tight, musically complex and original, Lateralus remains Tool's Magnum Opus. Their greatest, most achieved and most accomplished work.  An epic beyond all epics, Lateralus is the story of a human coming to grips with his/her purpose and fully embracing everything that has happened, the is happening and that will happen. It is the story of a human embracing the past, present and future as one: the now. It is the story of the limitless potential within us all to either create or destroy, or both. Lateralus speaks louder than any music and any words could ever speak.  The CD packaging says it all. It depicts a human, stripped of all flesh. Bare and open to the universe that surrounds him. You can see a glow surrounding the human, and you cansee his third eye open and releasing energy. All around the human is a vast, complex and unknowable energy that is pulsating and endless. - This sets the tone of the story to come.    Lateralus is about over-coming our human blunders, releasing the pain from the past, letting go of our ego and self - importance and welcoming in the un-predictable and entirely immense power of creation, and of the unknown. It is about shedding our anger, pain and hatred for something more intangible. It is embracing our experience as a human, which means fully accepting your responsibility and duties in the here and now.    Lyrically, these concepts are put forth through one of the most talented and greatest vocalist of our time, Maynard Keenan. His voice is so angelic and beautiful, yet can also delve into the depths of anger, rage and pain to bring forth the rawest of emotions. These lyrics pierce the veil of illusion and convey a message so out of the ordinary standard music fare, that it has and will pass over the heads of many. The lyrics are so personal yet they apply to everyone. They are sung with such conviction and sincerity and emotion that they will spark a flame within you. They will urge you to remember, remember something beyond our daily lives. Something that is so distant and alien, yet so familiar and warm. Something that we all feel, yet do not know how to verbalize or materialize into reality. The lyrics emanate energy that NEEDS to be felt by all humans.    Musically, Lateralus is immense, dense, complex and utterly astonishing.  Danny Carey's drumming is amazing, for lack of a better word. This drummer really explores his drum set, and seems to know it intimately through and through. His drumming is at times so complex, yet so structured that it literally demands all attention. The drumming seems to be a blend of avant-garde, tribal and modern rock themes that blend together into one coherent whole. They invoke visions and feelings within me that seem so far removed from myself, yet part of myself. The tribal sound and approach is so amazing an refreshing, it will evoke the primal energy within you. The drum work does not end at a regular drum set either, Danny brings tabla and hand drum energy to the mix as well, and it fits more perfect than the perfect puzzle piece.    The guitar work is simple, yet I do not think complexity is the aim of the  guitars on Lateralus. They are more for atmosphere and created to spark emotions and feelings from within. The guitar parts are futhermore bathed in a myriad of effects and manipulations that further enhance the sound.    The bass lines produce forth such a vibration and bounce along with the tribal and sporadic drumming; they are one and the same at times, creating this over-arching dimension that speaks of an ancient and long lost energies that dwell within all of us.    Along with the traditional instruments, there are a whole host of effects from synths to digaridoos (an Australian instrument - check it out) to all sorts of sounds that knit the overall atmosphere and emotion together.    Each song is grand and epic in scale, uses a perfect blend of dynamics and  emotion and is ever changing and evolving. Lateralus reveals a union of pregression and structure that is vastly ahead of all its peers. Each song is a behemoth of a feeling unto itself, each song is another dimension to explore and tune into.    In regards to an overall story, the contents and chapters are left up to the listener to decipher and learn.  But, songs like Parabol and its counterpart and sibling Parabola deal with  a human coming to grips with his responsiblity, embracing his humanity and accepting what has happened, accepting the pain the anger the strife the suffering, accepting the good, the bad and everything in between. These two songs symbolize that we are something greater than human and we are merely playing the role of \\"human\\" right now. These two songs depict such a joy and elation that is bothuplifting and revealing. These two songs are about being here right now, in your human form, living, being, accepting that you are a limitless energy taking the form of human. Parabol and Parabola further reveal the secret of this flesh vessel that we inhabit.    Lateralus, the title track, deals with many concepts. One of which seems to be the union of body and mind in order to pierce the unknown with clarity and awe. It deals with our unlimited power as beings of creation, it deals with embracing the now and being alive. It deals with an over-arching spiral of evolution that is within all creation, the evolution of energy. Lateralus is about pushing, bending and seeing past the regular, mundane, rational and tangible elements that we surround our lives with, that we were born into and stepping into the vast, immense and great unknown that pervades all.  Lateralus is about achieveing the Totality of our Being, becoming one with the dream, accepting our responsibility and mission as a human on this Earth, and true evolution.  The lyrics reflect this, as does the music. Lateralus is a powerful song that has layers upon layers.    The Patient deals with the trials and tribulations of walking a path of meaning, a \\"path of heart\\". Walking a path that rings true within you, regardless of what anyone says, or what anything does. Walking a path that  is hard, long and most arduous. A path that is not easily tread, nor is it convenient or comforting. Its a path that fully embraces the good with the bad, the right and the wrong. Its a path that reveals everything for what it truly is, including those within yourself. It is THE path to your true self.  The Patient is about being patient on the path to your true self. Its about being patient on this path because, on this particular path you will face all of the darkest, most depraved and vile aspects and elements of yourself and creation as a whole. There will be forces that will try their hardest to convince you to abandon and betray this path. The lyrics portray a human walking this \\"path\\", yet struggling deeply with it. The lyrics state that this human could easily walk away from this path and delve back into the darkness and self - indulgent life that he once knew. This song also deals with the relative ease of abandoning all hope as well. This song deals with the fact that, if there was no hope of release,  no loving embrace from his own being and from creation as a whole to encourage him on his path, if there was no hope for healing then this human would quickly leave this path and return to the depths.  A most poignant song.    The Grudge deals with our most human, rational and grounding aspect...anger, fear and holding onto the past like it was life itself. The Grudge deals with wearing all of these things as a crown of power, lording it over others and over life, living in a bitter and twisted shell that has lost all compassion, all love only to be filled with anger and hatred toward life. The Grudge deals with shedding this aspect of self - importance, of putting hate, anger, fear, jealousy and all similar emotions into perspective and into their proper place.  The Grudge deals with how we frantically and desperately grip onto our pain and our past, and how it weighs us down like an anchor, allowing ourselves to drown in ignorance and our own grossly inflated ego.  The Grudge deals with the Death of the old ways and the Birth of the New ways. Alchemy, turning our leaden grudges, which way us down and detriment us, into gold. Transformation, transfiguration, transmutation. To change these grudges and pain into acceptance and clarity.    Ticks and Leeches deals with the utter frustration and weariness of dealing with parasitic people who use and abuse through manipulation or abuse of power. It speaks from a blunt and emotionally drained human that wishes the parasite to get exactly what they wanted, to the point of suffocation. A very powerful and emotional track that speaks volumes.    Schism is one of the more powerful songs on the album. Dealing with a schism in communication between all things. Between humans and between humans and creation. Between the tangible and the intangible, but mostly between humans. This song deals with the small crack of misunderstanding growing until it becomes a divide that separates us all from each other. This song also deals with putting the pieces back together, and the power and ability TO put the pieces back together. Schism deals with how our egos and self - importance taint and color all  relationships, and how we struggle to repair them. We can all relate this this track, for we all have relationships with friends, family and lovers.    Disposition, Relfection and Triad all form one cohesive whole. Apparently they were supposed to be one long song, but the idea was ditched and this one song was split into three parts that are interconnected. Disposition deals with conversation between beings, and the raw power and force of nature and creation as a whole. Reflection deals with your reflection. What you really are, the purpose of us all, shedding the ego and self - importance to see the bigger picture, to feel the vast energy. Reflection deals with how we have a choice of either wallowing in our pain, anger and  narcissistic view of life, only furthering our sadistic urge to hurt ourselves all the while thinking that we are right and living our lives the way they should be, or shedding all of that for a vulnerable and open state that puts you in tune with creation and something ultimately bigger and more grand than just your life. The All. Triad is like the blend of both the intangible power of Disposition and the rational, tangible world of Reflection, blended with a raw tribal urge.    There are two instrumentals on Lateralus, Eon blue Apocalypse and Faaip de Quip, which I do not want to comment on.    All in All, Lateralus will force you to come to terms with your own being, your own actions, yourown responsibility while you are here on Earth. It will speak to you via feelings and show you yourself for what you truly are. Lateralus is a sonic juggernaut that plows through any definition and genre that is thrown at it. Dynamic and and full of the energy that pervades us all, Lateralus will bring you to One.

B000GDH9JQ|4.0|1985's \\"White Nights\\" pairs legendary ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov and equally legendary tap dancer Gregory Hines in a pedestrian Cold War thriller most notable for the dance sequences and the music score.<br /><br />Russian defector and former Bolshoi dancer Nikolai Rodchenko (Baryshnikov essentially playing himself) ends up back in Soviet hands when his airliner makes an emergency landing in Leningrad.  Overjoyed Soviet officials insist he rejoin the Bolshoi, and park him with American defector Raymond Greenwood (Hines) and his pregnant Russian wife (a young Isabella Rossellini) while he recovers from a minor injury.  The KGB tasks Raymond with getting Nikolai ready to dance, but Nikolai is intent on escaping again.  An abortive attempt brings him in contact with his former ballet partner (superbly played by Helen Mirren), now a director of the Bolshoi but envious of Nikolai's recent artistic freedom.<br /><br />Nikolai eventually gains the assistance of both Raymond and his former partner in a scheme to escape; Raymond because he wishes to see his child grow up free, and his former partner because she does not wish to see Nikolai crushed by the Soviet system.  The hair-raising escape across Leningrad ends in a dead heat with the pursuing KGB just outside the U.S. Consulate, where tough choices have to be made.<br /><br />The undoubted highlight of the movie are three dance sequences. One features Baryshnikov's free interpretation of a traditional Russian ballet for his former partner.  A second features Raymond's thrilling tap dance to some American music he hasn't heard in years.  The third is a fascinating mixed dance sequence by Nikolai and Raymond.  The movie score includes the Oscar-winning tune \\"Say You Say Me\\" by Lionel Ritchie.<br /><br />This movie is well-recommended to fans of Baryshnikov and Hines who remember their prime as exceptional dancers.  The storyline is somewhat contrived, but an excellent supporting cast helps carry it off.
B000P0J024|4.0|When a bunch of past-middle-age greats get together for fun, you just know there's a great time to be had by listeners as well. This really is an album for the converted and I suspect the unitiated will wonder what the fuss is all about. Musically it's consistent (although I think Vol. 1 has a little more edge and inspiration than Vol. 3). The DVD does offer some useful insights, and Bob Dylan's silence/lack of interviews speaks volumes about the man himself. I bought both volumes when they were first released (in cassette) and jumped at the chance to get this edition - and the notes are masterpieces of academic tongue-in-cheek writing, in the same tone as the music itself. Here's looking to Vol. 5.....
B00008G9JM|5.0|No-one likes this album: they either love it or they hate it. It polarises people.    Upon first listening to A Passion Play I was quite disappointed, especially when compared with Thick As A Brick, Jethro Tull's previous concept album. 'Why did I buy this junk?' I thought. My second listen felt a little better. By the third listen I was addicted.    It's fairly similar in structure to Thick As A Brick, though much darker in feeling. Brilliant chord progression and licks. I love the little intermission where \\"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\\" is told, backed with amazingly suitable music and other effects.    I absolutely love this album. It's a very close second to Thick As A Brick for me.

B0000542D2|5.0|After their first visit to the U.S. and three appearances on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964, the brains behind The Beatles, one Mr. Brian Epstein, decided to strike the fire while it was hot. In doing so, he created a phenomenon that few bands have ever witnessed or experienced other than The Beatles. \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" was the result. With this movie (in black & white) and the album release, he created a marketing plan that is still being used by many today. This movie gives the viewer a supposed look into the lives of the Beatles before and up to a televison performance. No doubt, these dudes were being seriously chased in real life, and this movie gives us a look at the madness from their perspective. If you've never seen this, watch it, you just may learn something. And while it's from a time of different attitudes and a simpler technology, it still delivers the goods from the standpoint of a fan. Yes, the songs are simple and light, but at the time they were also some of the most played on radio. This is a must own for any Beatles fan,  for it's a look at music history that will probably never be repeated again by anyone any time soon.
1594489505|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and the look at the culture from a woman's viewpoint.  The character development was spotty at times but did not detract from the overall story line.
B00000AOUD|5.0|When my brother first introduced me to Thick As A Brick in the early '90s (he had an LP) I was captivated by it. Sometime later I bought it on CD and one day, on my way to work on the train, decided to listen to it through my earphones. A special bond was about to be forged.     This will sound melodramatic, but I mean it: I tell you that album was made for that train trip. The first three minutes of the music and the train ride are calm and easy. Suddenly, both music and train become loud and frantic. At various times throughout both, the speed and energy rises and falls in close synchronisation. Although it's far too difficult and lengthy to go into all the details, I must say it was quite uncanny how well the music in my ears was so appropriate to the vision in my eyes.     I will always remember those days fondly, and Thick As A Brick will forever occupy a very special part of my heart and mind.     It's a very pleasant, positive sounding album in many respects, thanks to the chord progression and the use of flute, xylophone (or glockenspiel?), acoustic guitar and the synthesiser of the day (was it the Moog? I'm not quite sure). At the same time, if one examines the lyrics, one finds them to be less than positive and very metaphorical, as they are concerned with society and its often absurd rules and ways, and there is an inferred criticism towards these rules.     Instructions for listening:    You must not put this on in the background and do other things that distract you from the music: you absolutely must give it your undivided attention. It deserves nothing less, especially if you want to get the complete feeling and imagery it delivers. Immerse yourself in this masterpiece and you will be richly rewarded.    This album went to number one in the US and number five in the UK. It's widely regarded as perhaps Jethro Tull's finest work - their magnum opus - THE concept album. One of my favourite albums, closely followed by their next album \\"A Passion Play\\", analbum that polarises people, but that's another story.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|incredible, the best thing i think i have ever seen  i recommend it to any one,     just breath taking
6303823351|5.0|Loads of fun and this time in color! As a kid back then, I was awestruck!  These guys had it goin' on, and while the plot is a bit silly and over the  top, still, it was all fun and a great time had by all! Highly recommended to anyone who wants to know what all the fuss was about. These guys were the ultimate chick magnets of the time, and every guy I knew back then wanted to be just like them. The music's great, the songs are well written, the vocals were tops, and we get to see them in a variety of settings that were not on some movie sound stage. The Beatles are still one of the best selling bands in the world despite having split up in 1970, and this is one film every Beatles fan should own!
0385522401|2.0|I'm sorry, but what else can you say about a 22-year-old wife who ran away?   And who took almost 200 pages to do so, leaving her drooling groom and an untold number of readers on a beach filled with literary quicksand, struggling to find a likeable character or a redeeming bit of plot?       As I finished this book, I found myself humming \\"Where do I begin?\\" (the theme song from the movie version of Love Story). The similarities between that book and Chesil include length (both books barely squeak past 200 pages) and an ill-fated romance marked by different socioeconomic backgrounds and music.  But Edward and Florence are no Oliver and Jenny, and anyone who sheds tears at the end of Chesil is probably mourning the loss of $22 (even the $13.20 amazon price seems steep.)   I admire spare, chiseled prose, but McEwan's stiff, unyielding dialog feels wooden rather than trenchant.  The book reads like a period piece, a stylized sitting room drama from the turn of the last century.      Was Florence molested by her repulsive father?  Possibly.  But McEwan does his best to depict Edward as a pretty unappetizing boyfriend/husband.  Was Edward's inability to sense his bride's emotional state a result of his growing up with a brain-damaged mother in a pigsty of a house? Does it matter? (I have to admit that the description of the mess was probably my favorite part of this otherwise unappealing book.)  Though the story describes their courtship, the relationship has so little sizzle that it's hard to understand how the two of them managed to work up the energy to go through with a wedding.       After dragging us through the beach spat (their first and only fight? and even that lacked spirit), McEwan decides to take the easy way out.  So much for enduring love.  While I can accept the premise for most of the book--the stilted, boring couple, the unpleasant parents, the wedding night jitters--a lifelong estrangement defies all experience and common sense.  My impression was that McEwan was as tired of these colorless whiners as I was.      Finally, the big question: how did this book ever get published?  That's a rhetorical question, of course.  If anyone else had written this book and managed to get it into the hands of a publisher, he would have been told \\"nice treatment--shows a lot of promise--bring it back when you're finished.\\"  But when you're Ian \\"Booker Prize\\" McEwan, editors may be a little too kind.  As Ian himself might say, the result can be downright nauseous.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I watched this on Discovery HD first, and once I got the HD-DVD player addon for my xbox360 I knew this would by the first thing I'd get. The visuals all seem identical to the American Discovery Channel version, but I think David Attenborough definitely trumps Sigourney. Not only is his voice better, but it feels like he's a bit more verbose (although I haven't gone back to compare) - it sounds like he's giving more information.    The quality of the HD-DVD is great too, far better than the Discovery HD ones that aired on cable. I especially notice better quality in the fast moving scenes that got blocky on digital cable, but there is generally more detail in all the shots. I definitely recommend this for anyone, it's great to show off to your friends and make them want an HDTV.
0061122416|5.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" is a wonderful allegory that can be read at many levels depending on what you bring to the reading. Some will find a simple tale of a boy's adventure to Egypt. Others will find in this book a story that speaks of following your dreams and through following them undergoing a process of self-discovery and self-transformation. This is an awesome story of inspiration! I also recommend Nexus: A Neo Novel, which is a compelling tale of personal transformation similar to \\"The Alchemist.\\" Both books are about following your dreams and that is an important message to share with people around us to help them in their growth.
B000002UYZ|5.0|This two-disc album is part 1 of the definitive Best of the Beatles album, the second part being The Beatles 1967-1970.<br />The Beatles 1962-1966 is a fantastic tribute to beautiful musicof this great pioneering band in rock and roll, which dominated the musical scene of the 1960's with one magnificent hit after another. Listening to the Beatles really has a feel-good quality about it. In fact all these songs are masterpieces in the history of music.<br />My personal favourites are:<br /><br />I Want to Hold Your Hand<br />All My Loving<br />Hard Day's Night<br />Ticket to Ride<br />Yesterday<br />We Can Work It Out<br />Nowhere Man<br /> Michelle<br /> Paperback Writer<br />Eleanor Rigby<br />Yellow Submarine<br />Definitely a good choice for your first Beatles combination and an intro to why the 60's generation loved the Beatles so.<br />A good starter kit for new fans and a good piece of memorabilia for old fans revisiting the Beatles.
B00005JPQR|5.0|The Bourne Ultimatum concludes a fine movie series from screenplays of the late author Robert Ludlum.  Matt Damon, who seems to have been 'bourne' for the role, gives another fine performance along with along with a capable cast of Hollywood A-listers.  The screenplay is excellent, fast paced and provides satifactory closure for Jason Bourne, a.k.a. David Webb and for we, the viewing audience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, director Paul Greengrass absolutely refused to listen to the majority of viewers who (IMO) dissaprove of his deliberate, over-the-hill use of using a jack hammer for a tripod.  Matt Damon does 90% of his own stunts but you would never know it in TBS and especially in TBU!  Compare his fight scenes in TBI and compare them to TBS & TBU.  (Sadly, not even close)!<br /><br />ALL the fight and car chase scenes are so grossly distorted that the refreshing thrills provided by Bourne B.1 were severly attenuated in Bourne B.2 and completely lost in Bourne B.3.  If only executive producer Doug Liman had stayed in the directors chair, we would have have a trilogy of exponential proportions.<br /><br />The Screenplay  = 5 stars<br />Cinematography  = 1 star<br /><br />But regardless of the shakey hand camera in 2 & 3,  all three of the Bourne movies have been a pure viewers delight!
0307120007|5.0|This was one of my faves when I was little, and I still love it.  My baby is already enjoying at 7 months.  Any parent would be happy to receive this as a gift!
0739337297|5.0|I admit it took me several discs to get into  \\"I Am Messenger.\\" The accent of the narrator put me off for quite a while... and the story seemed to be going nowhere.<br />Then suddenly I found myself HOOKED by the characters, the story, the extraordinary thread running through an apparently ordinary story. It has that hypnotic effect that a good soap opera has when you simply must tune in to the next part of the story to find out what happens. The writing is sharp and starts piercing ethical expectations without warning.<br />As a writer I count this book as one that has changed my own short story writing technique. So, in that sense I count it as great contemporary literature... for me.
B000UDJS2S|3.0|Wow,    Nicholas Cage is slipping.  Worth a dollar but not much more.
1416509798|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is, of course, written differently than the novels today.  But that is a part of its appeal.  The author descriptively paints a portrait with his words and I gladly stepped into the story.  We read the book in our book club and everyone loved it.  Give it a try and see if you like it.
B000E0LB7C|5.0|Backhaus can do anything technically, has a gorgeous tone and is steeped in this musical tradition.  Whether the dark Opus 111 or the bouyant Op 31/1  Backahus can do it all.  If possible, supplement these stereo records with the earlier monoral ones.  I bought the mono set from professional and personable seller who can  get Japanese imports not available in the US.
B00003CXFV|5.0|This movie is a must have. This true story makes you think about things and helps you realize that you can change things if you put your mind to it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had seen the movie Serenity and really enjoyed it. I had no idea the movie was based on a TV series until I watched the bonus features on the DVD of the movie. I later bought the Firefly series and have enjoyed it alot. I like the way the series explains how the characters came together and also the fact that the movie does not stray at all from the series. Overall, I would highly recommend the Firefly series and if you buy it, you're in for a good time.
B00000DFSK|5.0|This is an excellent introduction to and overview of teh first decade of U2's career.  A slew of hits is on here, great music from start to finish.  My only little disappointment is the absence of \\"In God's Country\\" from the Joshua Tree.  The people who downgrade this CD appear to be people ticked off that their personal fav wasn't put on here; I don't see much quarrels with the music.  Because there shouldn't be any; this is great stuff on here.  Suffcient stuff from Rattle and Hum is on here that I was able to give up that CD; this CD has all the core hits from that album.  Worth having for sure.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Wonderful way to purchase one of the best movies ever made.  Sound is excellent - video is limited by original film medium but still looks great on a 102\\" screen!<br />Commentary by Julie Andrews on bonus disks is fun and enlightening.  Very pleased with the purchase.

B0007XT87G|5.0|I have finally found my new band in Porcupine Tree and Deadwing is my first exploration of their music.  How have I missed these guys???  As a big Pink Floyd fan and a frustrated Dream Theater Fan of recent years Porcupine Tree seems to offer everything I have been wanting in music; emotion, innovative song structures, quite and heavy passages that blend seemlessly, atmospheric layers of instrumentation, well crafted vocal harmonies and well written lyrics.  I have become bored with the heavier side of Prog where technical ability is starting to dominate song craft (are you reading this DT?) but Porcupine Tree seems to emphasize song craft over everything else yet the production and musicianship is still very good.  What I like the best is some of the surprising melodies and harmonies in the middle of the songs.  I also like the emotion they create in their songs by letting themes develop.   As well, Deadwing seems to offer a good balance of more mellow yet haunting songs and straight forward heavier songs.    I think I will savor this album for a few more weeks before diving into In Absentia and Fear of a Blank Planet which are next on my list.
0143038419|5.0|I do all three! I just loved this book. Sometimes I felt like someone was reading my thoughts out loud. I gave copies to many of my single friends and insisted they read it. Its for everyone but most of all for people needing reassurance that we can get through the storms and live in sunshine.
B00022LRXA|5.0|Often denigrated due to its proximity to \\"Another Green World\\", \\"Before and After Science\\" is in many ways a more mature and experimental record than its beloved sibling. First, a few particular things to recall about the original release: The very sentimental watercolor reproductions originally struck this listener as utterly out of sync with the rather strident adherence to some twentieth century art music ideas explored in the compositions. A more fitting approach to the visuals was demonstrated a few years earlier, in the portfolio created for \\"So Far\\" by Faust, which in turn set the template followed by Peter Gabriel's \\"Us\\" portfolio. Second, and more importantly, was Eno's printed insistence that no noise reduction systems were used in the recording. This is itself interesting to note because the sound quality of BAAS is decidedly un-commercial. It doesn't \\"sparkle\\" and there are no detectable artificial peaks -- the usual spots being cranked up between 1kHz and 2kHz -- that used to be so essential to successful airplay. Instead, the overall tonality is round, warm and, in context, completely out of touch with most of the recordings of the late 70s let alone early 00s, and this reissue still respects his decision for what might be called an \\"unadulterated\\" approach to the sound -- an interesting decision from someone known for manipulating audio signals.<br /><br />To be clear, this should be considered a very positive attribute, despite the sometimes nagging low frequency compromises due to the equally interesting absence of compression. The point seems to simply be a dedication to the sound of the instruments \\"as is\\", in direct opposition to the completely non-referential definitions of fidelity that determine most music production today. How many critics and listeners this apparently \\"muted\\" sonic presence added to the ranks of the record's detractors is hard to say, but it does seem likely that many people did not get past the non-commercial sound to allow themselves to actually hear what was going on, as still evidenced by some of the reviews posted here which seem puzzled by the character of the sound, mistakenly referred to as the \\"sound quality\\".<br /><br />In addition to its clearly non-commercial orientation there are many brilliant conceptual and performance moments spread throughout. Hard to ask more of the contributions of Percy Jones and Phil Collins, fresh in love with Brand X, or Kurt Schwitters' posthumous vocals which presage the still astonishing collaboration with David Byrne on \\"My Life in the Bush of Ghosts\\". There is the wonderfully simple and beautiful mesh of pattern and lyric that is \\"By This River\\", the collaboration with Cluster and the \\"Caucasian Lullaby\\"-like instrumental exchanges of \\"Through Hollow Lands\\" with Fred Frith. And of course the nearly erotic yet somnolent, minimalist and wide-open \\"Julie With...\\" (no pun intended). Not to forget Bill MacCormick, Brian Turrington and others covering the range from pop to experimental rock.<br /><br />Considering that vast span of pop to experimental and the artists and influences present here, BAAS is now something of a time capsule, with each track representing an epitome, of sorts, of the various styles and theories running behind the most interesting musics of its day. Thirty years on, the ideas are still compelling, and the artistic decisions still stand out as remarkable.themselves to actually hear what was going on, as still evidenced by some of the reviews posted here which seem puzzled by the character of the sound, mistakenly referred to as the \\"sound quality\\".<br /><br />In addition to its clearly non-commercial orientation there are many brilliant conceptual and performance moments spread throughout.

B000000HSU|5.0|The pure energy in this album is amazing. H.R. is singing with all his might, and it creates a one-of-a-kind sound. Dr. Know just tears things up every now and then.  This album contains the classical mix of lots of hardcore/punk, sprinkled with reggae. If you are a reggae fan, than you will love this album just because of it's three awesome reggae songs. \\"I and I Survive\\" is great!  The hardcore/punk part of this album is the bulk. Any true hardcore/punk fan should immediately fall in love with this album.
B00005JMXX|3.0|All of our main characters survive that in reality most if not would have died had these events really happened.  They built a pretty good story around a worst case scenario and the acting wasn't bad, not great but 3 stars.  I've watched this movie a couple of times and I think that's all the life I will get out of it, worth watching, but not worthy of library space.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This has to be one of the most beautifully moving films I've seen in quite some time.  I highly reccomend this!

1932907009|5.0|Okay, this is a must have! Read it. Loved it! Wow, talk about a guy who gives you the guts and confidence to write, call or befriend, an agent, producer or studio executive and say, \\"Gotta minute? Let me pitch you my latest script!\\" Save the Cat by Blake Synder has practical, no-crap wisdom. It's interesting, fun and insightful. Synder invites you into his realm, especially when it comes to Hollywood and what works, and most importantly, what sells! I laughed a lot, too. Synder's excitement is contagious and his screenwriting structure, \\"The Cat-method\\", helped me tremendously. I was completely motivated and creatively inspired. Synder's professional sense and clarity make it The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need. Because the guy is for you and when I was done with the book, I knew I'd be a success. Now that's something to write about!
B000N4SHPS|4.0|They way I look at a Rocky movie is that it ought to be about PEOPLE, not boxing. The original Rocky, from way back in '76...has about 10 minutes of actual boxing in it. Stallone, I feel, got lost in the 80's. Every movie suddenly had some sort of political bent.<br /><br />Rocky doesn't care about politics. He cares about people. Really the only film in the series that is an absolute embarrassment is Rocky IV, with the Rambo-ish cold war overtones. Even Rocky V tried to get back to basics, and suffered with trying to have it both ways, Rocky losing everything, yet still feeling \\"comfortable.\\"<br /><br />Rocky Balboa gets it right. I miss Adrian, but it's the right choice to pound home the point that Rocky has LOST something. Stallone finds the heart of the character and story again, where your greatest challenge is yourself. Mason Dixon isn't presented as a villian, but as a young man who's lost his way as well. Both he and Rocky find the true reason to do anything...for yourself.<br /><br />I loved it. It moved me. 4 Stars just because it's not the original, but nothing really can be.
0061142026|4.0|When I found out the movie Stardust was based off a novel, I couldn't help myself but go out and buy it.<br /><br />Coming from a die hard fan of books like The Neverending Story, Harry Potter and Eragon, it's hard for me to have high expectations for any book to be better than those.<br /><br />Stardust started off a bit boring to me. It did not catch my attention right away and I had to force myself through the first couple of chapters to really get sucked in. But the fact of the matter is I definetly did! It defently is a light read, but at the same time one has to really pay attention to the details, because in a J.K Rowling-esque style, all the sub-plots and little details all come to play in the end.<br /><br />I found this book to be very charming. It reminded me very much of The Neverending Story by Michael Ende, except for much shorter and somewhat of a cheesy love story. I would have loved for the book to be longer and have more plot line. By the time I got really into the book, three fourths of it was finished. Maybe I'm too used to very lengthy books, however.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone with a love of other world type fantasy novels. It was well worth the time I spent procrastinating to do homework :)
0385733577|5.0|We listened to this book on CD on a family vacation...2 adults and 3 kids...ages 6-12. We really enjoyed it.  Wonderful how the author brought together so many myths and legends and yet still a lively story.      A funny thing...as usual we were late leaving on our trip and had not yet made the trip to the library to pick up a bunch of Books on CD.  I called the librarian and asked her to pull 4-5 Books for the kids age group.  She gave us the Alchemyst in the bunch of books...it was our favorite by far.  Talk about your cliff hangars though.  When we stopped at a library on our travels, I sent a \\"nasty\\" gram to the librarian...complaining that she shouldn't have just given us BOOK 1...now we have to wait the whole trip before we can find out what happens.  Now we all are looking forward to Book 2.

B000R8YC18|5.0|In Brief: Martin Scorsese leads us into the darkness of the human soul by exploring the character of one Travis Bickle, a disillusioned Vietnam veteran played by Robert De Niro. Failing to make a connection with those around him, Travis decides to take matters into his own hands, via such instruments as firearms and interesting fashion statements.<br /><br /> Yes, De Niro is brilliant, and yes, Scorsese's techniques are still as effective today as they were innovative in 1976.<br /><br />Meanwhile, one element that often goes unmentioned outside of deeper analyses of the film is its musical score, one of Bernard Herrmann's last and very finest. With the veteran composer of Alfred Hitchcock films tabbed for this film, you might have expected dark and disturbing, Psycho-esqe music, befitting Taxi Driver's status as a nightmarish psychological journey. Horrific dirges find their way into the score on occasion, but surprisingly, Herrmann more often used a jazzy, romantic theme to underscore Travis' subconscious rants about the \\"scum\\" and \\"filth\\" he'd like to wipe out of New York City.<br /><br /> Scorsese has shown over the course of his career that he is a director chiefly interested in the duality of human nature - capturing the seductiveness of the mob (Goodfellas), the loneliness of a champion (Raging Bull), and even the humanity of Jesus himself (The Last Temptation of Christ) - and here he presents his most complex character. Is Travis a hero or a monster? The question is never answered to any satisfying degree,<br /> The director makes no overt rejection of Travis Bickle's ultimate violence, but it may be found in the way the outburst is filmed: the massacre is artfully done, but brutal and unrelenting, and tellingly, there is no music. Herrmann's score works here by its very absence: he and Scorsese subtly inform us that there is no counterpoint to the violence, that it is what it is - and that for the audience, just as Travis must feel, there is no escape.<br /><br />Thanks Shay Casey
B000PTYP5C|2.0|DT has been on a change of course since SDOIT.  They have become Pantera.  While this album mellows out a little, still not classic DT like I and W, and M2, or Awake.  I have been a fan since the beginning,and have seen them in concert over a dozen times, but I think they have jumped the shark.
B000GY729M|3.0|As a big fan of Hot Fuss, this album was a big disappointment...BUT several songs did REALLY grow on me.  The production is low and they lost a lot of their Brit pop feel.  There are just a couple songs though that are really catchy and a couple that really choke me up.  mas o menos, I say...

B000FVQYYK|4.0|I have been a long-time fan of Muse, beginning with Absolution, then heading back to ones which soon became my favorites.  I loved Showbiz and it's deep mood and the different sound Origin of Symmetry showed.  When I heard the single Knights of Cydonia, I was surprised at the difference between it and my favorites.  I HAD to buy the record, and after a few tries, it grew on me.  I know it's not as hard as Absolution, or as emotional as Showbiz, or as 'scream-y' as Origin of Symmetry, but if you're okay with change and a pop sound, you may like it.  Still not my favorite album, but it is worth the money for the few incredible cuts.

0143037757|5.0|This book was a Christmas present to my husband, a history major in college and he has written this review.  A brilliant work of European History since 1945.  It should be mandatory reading for all members or candidates for the U.S. Congress.  It might change U.S. foreign relations.  Mr. Judt has done an incredible job of treating state affairs of each European country during the decades.  He does superior work of tracing themes of the various eras from East and West Europe.  He makes readers realize that U.S. foreign policy did not dominate Europe from 1945 to 2005.  This is not a fast read.  It stimulates so many refletions.
B00005JPQR|5.0|\\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" completes one of the best film trilogies ever made. I think if you look at these three films as separate entries, they each stand up as very good examples of filmmaking. And as a trilogy, they are exemplary.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) limps along a snowy Moscow street, trying to elude the police. But they quickly spot him and he has to evade them before making his way into Western Europe. There, he reads a story in the Guardian, written by columnist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine, \\"In America\\"), about him, the death of his girlfriend in India and more. Clearly, this reporter has talked to someone who knows a lot of secrets. He arranges to meet Ross, but a covert arm of the FBI, led by Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) has also learned of Ross' knowledge and wants him dead. Bourne spots the FBI agents at their designated meeting place and has to help Ross elude the men before they can meet. This leads to a terrific game of cat and mouse throughout Waterloo Train Station. Bourne eventually gets to talk to the reporter and learns about Operation Blackbriar, an extension of Project Treadwell, the project Bourne initially joined. Bourne's next stop, Madrid, where the informant is located. Frustrated with his inability to stop Bourne, Vosen brings in Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to help track the elusive agent. In Madrid, Bourne encounters Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who was reassigned to this station after their last encounter. She decides to help him as much as possible, and they momentarily throw Vosen off the track. But they are now on the run. With every step, Bourne's memory comes back to him and he soon remembers everything. EVERYTHING. Leading him back to New York. Leading him back to Vosen, Landy and Blackfriar.<br /><br />Picking up basically where \\"Supremacy\\" left off, director Paul Greengrass (\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", \\"United 93\\"), writer Tony Gilroy (\\"The Bourne Identity\\", \\"Supremacy\\" and \\"Ultimatum\\") and star Matt Damon bring us to the conclusion of this fantastic trilogy.<br /><br />Even with two different directors working on the series, all three films have had remarkable consistency. If anything, Greengrass brings a more frantic style of cinematography to the films he has directed. How does he do this? With a lot of handheld camera work. This may turn some people off, in \\"Ultimatum\\", I counted maybe two shots that were not done with a handheld camera, but this technique works very favorably for this type of film. Using a handheld camera does two things; it gives us the eye of the surveillance watching Bourne and all of his counterparts and it makes everything very close to us, a little more frantic and more dangerous. Because Bourne is always being watched, or more accurately, someone is always trying to watch him, the handheld camera gives us the feel of surveillance cameras swooping through train stations and public places trying to pick up the subject. One of the more memorable scenes in \\"Ultimatum\\" shows Vosen (Strathairn) and his team, in New York, using all of their tools and tricks to track the Guardian reporter in London. They make it look so easy, and I'm sure this isn't far from the truth. Since Bourne is trying to meet with the reporter, he is also aware of their tricks and has to choreograph the meeting, getting the reporter into a safe place, helping him to elude the surveillance. It is a nifty piece of cat and mouse action. Throughout the film, the camera remains very close to Bourne and when he has conversations with people, we see them from over his shoulder, or vice versa. As they talk, the camera will shift a little and the subjects shoulder fills in more of the frame, giving us a small view of Bourne. Again, this helps to bring us into Bourne's world, giving us a feel of the claustrophobic, dangerous quality his life has.<br /><br />Because \\"Ultimatum\\" is about Bourne remembering things, and trying to get his life back, the character has to go through a lot of change. As Bourne learns more of the puzzle, his memories gradually return. Damon has a lot on his plate to make this part of the character believable while the film continues to deliver all of the action we are hoping for. Bourne has been a killer and covert agent for a long time, so his emotions aren't going to come flooding back to the surface. I don't think he is capable of showing more than a little emotion at any one time. In \\"Supremacy\\", when his girlfriend, Marie (Franka Potente, \\"Run Lola Run\\") is killed in India, he is disturbed, but he never breaks down and cries. He doesn't have time for this. The killers are soon after him and he has to keep moving. In \\"Ultimatum\\", Bourne stops in Paris to tell her brother, Martin (Daniel Bruhl, \\"Goodbye, Lenin\\") about her death. As Bourne speaks, he remains his normal self, but it is clear he is having difficulty relaying the events to her brother. Do they hug and provide comfort to one another? Of course not. Bourne can't let his defenses down or show weakness. Yet, throughout, Damon manages to provide quick little glimpses of how all of this is affecting him. And the performance is entirely consistent with his character and the story.<br /><br />Some of these glimpses give us the feeling that as Bourne's memory returns, he realizes he doesn't need to kill everyone. So he steps away from some people, people who don't need to die for him to get to his next goal. As his memory returns, he realizes he has a conscience.<br /><br />The action throughout is fantastic. From the cat and mouse sequence in Waterloo to a number of fights between Bourne and various assassins, he never has a chance to get a breath. Greengrass' handheld camera also helps to make these scenes seem more dangerous and challenging, more intimate. Because we are so close to the action, we feel as though we are part of it, engaged in the action with Bourne as he uses his fist, knives, whatever he can get his hands on. Most of the action scenes involve hand to hand combat, and these are choreographed in such a way that helps us keep track of the action. Sure, it moves fast and furious, and we don't always see the two characters faces, but we know who is where when it matters.<br /><br />There is also a significant amount of other action in these films. In \\"Ultimatum\\", this involves a car chase through New York with a unique and interesting beginning and finish.<br /><br />\\"Ultimatum\\" is set against the backdrop of our current government, an institution that believes they need to watch anyone and everyone, they have the right to lock people up, to kill them, if they are even suspected of posing a threat to our nation. Greengrass and Gilroy integrate these ideas into the framework of the story, allowing Bourne to uncover the full details, giving us a believable, interesting look at what our government could be, may be capable of. But don't question them. If you do, you are threatening the lives and safety of millions of Americans.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" caps off the best trilogy to come out of Hollywood in the last decade. Looking at some recent examples, each trilogy has at least one seriously flawed entry. \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" and \\"Spiderman\\" each had dismal third entries in their series. \\"Ocean's 12\\" didn't have a very cohesive or interesting screenplay.

A weak first film followed by two stronger films, all of which are from different directors who add their individual styles, so it isn't a cohesive whole. If anything, each film in the \\"Bourne\\" series has built on the success of the previous entry, ratcheting the level of suspense, action and intrigue.

It's a great historical fact movie that not only explores one mans experiences during WWII but the great majority of Nazi \\"Unwanted Peoples\\", Jews, Gypsies, etc.    It's a film that is important for everyone to watch because if we do not learn and remember what has happened in the past we are destined to repeat it.

B000059GEH|5.0|A great classic!  Lauren, Betty and Marilyn at their best.  Bacall has great timing and delivery as well as some of the best lines (e.g., \\"he's a character straight from characterville\\" or when asked if she thinks having money will automatically make you happy she replies, \\"no, but it doesn't automatically depress me either.\\") Marilyn is an absolute hoot especially in regard to her reluctance to wear glasses, because \\"men aren't attentive to girls who wear glasses,\\" as if that could ever apply to her!  Grable is equally charming as a naive model who travels to a \\"lodge\\" with a married man because she has fond memories of an Elks Convention. It's all good, clean, fun with a clever little wrap up at the end.  A definite keeper!

Excellent reading!
B000LXH0AE|3.0|My opinion of this DVD is both the highest and lowest, which explains my medium star rating. On one hand, the movie is the best I have seen in several years. It is original, clever, and engaging. I loved it in the theater only.    On the other hand, it simply won't play on my DVD player (Sony DVP-CX995V 400-disk changer). On my PC, the DVD launches the included \\"Interactual\\" player, but won't play in any other DVD application.    This was true in two rental copies.    Examination of the DVD file structure shows the usual, but at the disk's root directory, there is an Adobe/Macromedia Flash \\"projector\\" player file. I don't know if that's really the problem because the Pan's Labyrinth DVD seems to be designed the same way.    Any thoughts?
0316067598|1.0|Poor planning does not make you a hero. nor does killing unarmed civilians, which not only is against the geneva convention, but immoral, and no officer worth his salt would consider this as a viable option, mush less put it to a vote. This book fails on many levels. Why did they not have blood chits? why did they have secret information with them? they did not need it. watch the video on youtube. Where were their contingencies? commo failure, compromise, QRF? And why is this guy so full of himself?   This is a poorly written book by another SEAL among many who have no understanding of todays battlefield.  They ignored all the intel which was available and took a mission SF turned down. This mission was a series of horrible decisions, the results of which the author blames on the liberal media.
B000NA28I4|2.0|Overall - well, it's a step up from the Dungeon's and Dragon's movie, but only in the CGI department.    Want to say I haven't read the book.  I keep flipping through it once in a while, but between the blatant borrowing of so many tolkien concepts and names, the whining of the lead character - well, I just couldn't really get into it, sorry.  So, I was looking forward to the movie.  Sigh.  The script writer should have been crucified.  There is just no way to \\"boil\\" down a book with this many characters and scope - and ceratinly not with the ludicrious, weak dialogue that's in it.  Also, although the director thought it was a FABULOUS idea, there are WAY too many big name actors in here!  with horrible dialogue!  which not only overshadow the lead, there is so LITTLE time spent on them, you wonder why the money was spent on them.  There is nothing worse then watching a first rate actor struggle with stupid dialogue.  Clues from the director on what the movie was supposed to be like: Galbatorix is supposed to be \\"conflicted\\" - ahhh, really?  Didn't come across at all.  He just looks pissed and bored, if it's possible to have the combination.  The chick on the horse was an elf?  Well, since no mention of it was ever made, she doesn't have the ears, etc, how exactly is someone supposed to know that?  Dwarves are in this movie?  Um, where exactly?  Also, the dude with the long beard is a KING?  Did I miss where they introduce him that way?  It's absolutely ludicrous.  Maybe they'll get a new director from the second one as well.    Saphira is great, and the lead actor really isn't too bad given HIS horrible dialogue, makes it worth watching.  If you support fantasy movies and are hoping the next movie will be unbelievably better, buy it and support the genre - and enjoy saphira.  No miracles here however.
B00005JPHT|5.0|There are two major issues in health care reform, the ethical and financial:<br /><br />1-Ethical: Is health care a human right?<br /><br />2-Economic: Can health care be delivered in a cost effective manner?<br /><br />Michael Moore (along with the overwhelming evidence from all the major studies by the US government, academicians', Non-Governmental Organizations and various oversight commissions) shows that the US system fails on both accounts. While pundits will almost always assert that US health care is the \\"best in the world\\" I challenge them to show me one major statistic where this is true.  It just can't be done because the data are in, and we are far from the best in any major health care category. Is this US bashing-No these are just the facts. And if we begin to look at them we may be able to do something about them. (Please review health data from the US Congressional Budget Office, the US General Accountability Office, US Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality, the Commonwealth Fund, the United Nation-World Health Organization, New England Journal of Medicine, Health Affairs, Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development-None exactly radical organizations, to confirm my statements). But it is just too easy to assume we are the best, after all only one who is un-American could doubt that we are the best. And we should just attack them and dismiss the actual facts in the matter. So for those who would bash this review I anticipate very little in the way of factual information and a great number of Ad-hominem attacks. Independent & critical thinkers please look out for this fallacious method of argument.<br /><br />Ethics of distributive justice teach us about many different ways to distribute scarce resources (My thinking on this topic is heavily influenced by Deborah Stone the author of chapter 4 in the excellent book \\"Healthy, Wealthy & Fair-Oxford University Press ISBN 0-19-517066-00). To see a hit movie or popular Broadway show we line up and use the principle of first come first served. For admission to college we do not take people first come first serve, but use a merit system based on grades and SAT scores (at least in principle). For first-class seating in a plane we use cost to select who can afford to pay for the extra leg room and other amenities. So we use different ethical principles to divide societies riches depending on which domain we are discussing. So what principle should guide the distribution of health care? Most people would agree that health care should be distributed based on need. If you don't need an antibiotic then you should not get it and if you do need one you should get it. This simple assertion has significant implications for how to implement a health care system, one being that health care should be considered a human right. Funny how some free marketeers want to consider it a fundamental right for people to own private property but consider it a privilage to be assured access to health care.<br /><br />Health care is fundamentally different from most other commodities in society. Not everyone needs or can afford a plasma TV (own private property), however everyone needs to be healthy in order to be a productive member of society. So this is a fundamental requirement to achieve any other essential goal in life; for if you are significantly ill you can not work, learn, volunteer, play or just contemplate the world. This is why all other countries (not just the industrialize world) consider health care a human right (along with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to which the US is a signatory). If you are sick and can not afford care (unless we are willing to just let people die) then society will in some manner pay for those in desperate need. As it stands we do this now, but in a most demeaning and cost inefficient way.<br /><br />For-profit companies in the medical industry like to scare people by telling them that:<br /><br />1- The government is inefficient (this is an ideological assumption which is just NOT true-see documents below).<br />2- That the government is big, bad, and controlling every aspect of your life (also not true-at least the government can change with elections-When was the last time YOU helped remove a corporate CEO from his position). In all countries in which people have universal health care citizens are free to pick there own health care provider-so why does this even come up as an issue.<br /><br />Moore brilliantly juxtaposes the actions of corporations which truly have no accountability to the insured but do have a legal obligation to shareholders to maximize profits, to that of health care systems based on providing care to those in need.  Real scientific (Peer-reviewed) studies show consistently that the US system is both the most expensive and one of the least efficient health care systems in the world. Many, many studies show this. The Commonwealth fund recently used 37 indicators (all compared to achievable indicators-based on current best practices) and only rated our system 66% out of 100%. (For details see: [...])<br /><br />The New England Journal of Medicine in an article \\"The Quality of Health Care Delivered to Adults in the US\\" June 26, 2003, documented that Adults only received 55% of recommended care. The World Health Organization in a systematic review of health care systems around the world ranked the US 37th. In any major indicator-Life Expectancy, Healthy Years of Life, Infant Mortality, number of doctors visits (lower in US than most other countries); the US is no where near the top of the list.<br /><br />In terms of government run health care: there is no inherent reason why patients should not have a choice of provider-so this scare tactic is a non sequitur. In terms of efficiency, free market advocates lose again because in all health systems with a profit motive, less of the health care dollar is spent on providing actual care and more is spent on profits and administration than in government run systems. This means that the government run systems are more efficient. Look at data on Medicaid and Medicare where administrative cost run in the 2-3% range compared to the private sector where it is not uncommon for administration to be 8-10 times greater in the range of 20-30%. Not only are the administrative costs greater in a for-profit system (See-New England Journal of Medicine article \\"Costs of Health Care Administration in the US & Canada-August 21, 2003 and also New England Journal of Medicine \\"Cost of Care and Administration at For-Profit and Other Hospitals in the US\\") but the QUALITY of care in for profit vs. public hospitals demonstrate that for-profits consistently provide lower quality care (See Jounal of the American Medical Association July 14,1999-\\"Quality of Care in Investor-Owned vs. Not-for-Profit HMO's\\" where for ALL 14 quality indicators examined the for-profits did a substantially worse job at providing quality care). In another review in the Social Science Quarterly (Volume 84 Issue 2 Page 219, June 2003) in an article entitled \\"Two Decades of Research Comparing For-Profit and Nonprofit Health Provider Performance in the US\\" the conclusion drawn was \\"Overall, the nonprofits were judged superior 59 percent of the time, for-profits superior only 12% of the time, and for the rest (29 percent), no difference was found or the results were mixed\\". By putting money which would otherwise go to administrative overhead or profits back into DIRECT patient care we get much greater efficiency. So it is NOT that the government is inefficient it is that the government is TOO efficient and THIS TAKES AWAY PROFITS from the private sector. This is why corporations run scare campaigns to confuse people about the real issues.<br /><br />Another point is that efficiency should not be the measure of all things economic. The economy should be focused on people and their needs. It might be more economically efficient to kick grandma outof the second floor apartment and get a paying tenant but is it the right thing to do?<br /><br />So do single payer systems have problems?  Of course. The biggest one is waiting times. However, we must remember that since in almost all cases citizens of these countries live longer and on average have MORE healthy years of life this is clearly a secondary issue. All countries have a system where those in emergent need get seen in a timely manner (otherwise they would not fair so well on the health data previously cited). Not often mentioned is that a list becomes a relatively equitable way to ration care by allocating resources first come first serve as long as emergency needs do not take precedence. In the US we do NOT make lists; the insurance company will just deny your claim for 5 months before (maybe) granting your request. So you were NOT on a waiting list for 5 months BUT IN FACT WAITED-but those other countries put you on a list-terrible! We should also recall that these countries spend about HALF as much per person to provide superior care. If they were to spend just a bit more as many are now starting to do (in Canada for instance they are beginning to use physician assistants to reduce waiting times- bias alert-I am a physician assistant educator) the problem of waiting could be rectified. Often free market opponents of single payer, resist paying into the system in an amount that would eliminate the waiting so they can have an issue to complain about. The whole argument is a bit absurd. Would you rather starve to death (and be free of government \\"interference' in your life) or wait on a line and get free food. Only those who have enough to eat would argue that the wait is not worth it. And now that more and more people are finding out that they to are vulnerable the move is on for a universal single payer health care system in the US.<br /><br />This outcome (single payer) is not likely to be achieved even though it is the one favored by the majority of people (look at any public opinion poll for the past 40 years and a MAJORITY not a just a plurality will be found to support a government run health care system-usually even if it cost more in taxes-which due to greater efficiencies may not even be necessary). For details about several recent polls see ([...]  But the political process and allegiance of politicians to corporate (not special) interests make this \\"politically unfeasible\\" despite the fact that most Americans desire it. But that is a different problem for a different diatribe.<br /><br />Bobby Keith, MPA, PA-C<br />Clinical Director<br />Mercy College Graduate Program in<br />Physician Assistant Studiesare more efficient.

B00005JPLW|4.0|Excellent quality, great extras on the second disk.  Amazing direction, fabulous acting by everyone, settings, characters and above all, phenomenal visuals.  Doesn't get 5 stars only because the dialogue was really hacked, choped out of other historical speeches.  Every time I heard a borrowed line like \\"people will remember that few stood against many\\" etc. etc. it jerked me right out of the movie.  Other than that, absolutely magnificient.

B000OPOANE|5.0|Rush's Snakes and Arrows MVI DVD provides the best of both worlds. I enjoyed the \\"behind the scenes\\" video chronicaling the recording of \\"Snakes and Arrows,\\" especially the scenes of the band jamming together. Also, some very nice analysis from the boys about how they came to create this great music.  The other plus is the \\"album\\" itself, placed on DVD format.  This is great if your computer has a decent sound system, or if you have a couple of speakers hooked up to your television.  Really top notch.  On a side note, the \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" shows have been fantastic.  Rush is in stride.

B000I1QNRU|5.0|Quite simply, this is the greatest album ever made, by the best band ever to walk the earth, containing my favorite song ever. Nothing compares to this one: the songwriting, the instrumental performances, the innovation, and the feeling that went into the music. This was one of the first albums to use synthesizers, and arguably the first to do anything that made musical sense with them: in fact, they play key roles on key songs such as Here Comes the Sun, Because and Maxwell's Silver Hammer. That's not all that's good about it, though: it's also the best collection of material the Beatles ever recorded, which is saying a lot. After showing all kinds of potential, George Harrison finally matured into a full-fledged songwriter, penning the aforementioned Greatest Song Ever, Here Comes the Sun. I cannot begin to describe how much I love this one: the lyrics, the melody, the mood, and the quirky but charming synthesizer all blend together perfectly. Also found here is George's lone #1 hit with the Beatles, his tender ballad Something, which is my second-favorite on the album. My favorite part of it is George's guitar solo: time and again he proves himself to be the one of most underrated lead guitarists I can name you. Do you think Jimmy Page could've equalled the emotion put in that solo? I don't.<br />It's not just a one-man show, though. For one, Ringo puts in his best song with the Beatles, Octopus' Garden, a charming country-rocker. And of course Lennon and McCartney were still delivering the goods too: John gives us the slightly funky, stream-of-conscienceness Come Together, with a solid groove and a cool organ solo from Billy Preston; the haunting, melodic, near-a capella Because; the soothing nonsense of Sun King (part of the famous \\"Abbey Road Medley\\" - I'll explain that in more detail later); the brief, brass-driven Mean Mr. Mustard (more of the medley), and the punkish, acoustic Polythene Pam (which is also part of the medley). And Paul came up with the Side Two medley I've mentioned before: I'm not quite sure what inspired them to take several fragmentory songs and string them together (I assume John's similarly composed I Am the Walrus had something to do with that), but it was a brilliant idea regardless. The medley takes on a wide variety of styles, starting with You Never Give Me Your Money (another highlight), which is a medley unto itself: part one is a piano ballad a la the then-unreleased Let It Be; part two is a rocker; part three is a smoothly harmonized climax which has a guitar jam that would be reprised later on. I already discussed the next three songs, or rather fragments; next up is the catchy rocker She Came in Through the Bathroom Window, a humorous tale of an obsessive McCartney fan who once crawled through his window for an autograph. Its follow-up is something totally different: the classically influenced, almost lullaby-like Golden Slumbers, which in turn becomes the soccer-stadium chant Carry That Weight, containing a huge horn fanfare and a reprise of You Never Give Me Your Money. This is followed by another one of my favorite bits: The End. This is really the only jam track the Beatles ever recorded, starting with an all-too-rare Ringo drum solo and continuing into a series of guitar solos that mimic the one found at the end of You Never Give Me Your Money. It sounds great, and they keep it short rather than going completely overboard with longwinded, indulgent soloing. The funny, lighthearted Her Majesty (a hidden track! Maybe the first!) closes things out in a fine way. Paul also gets a couple tunes in on side one, and they're both great: his Maxwell's Silver Hammer could almost be a bouncy jingle if it weren't about a topic as happy as a serial killer, while Oh! Darling is almost like an hard-rock Little Richard: Paul sure screams like the guy, while John pumps out loud, crude, distorted rhythm guitar riffs. This also contains an early metal song, the simple-but-effective I Want You (She's So Heavy). This one's a real love-it-or-hate-it track, but I enjoy all of its eight minutes, even the infamous repetitive fadeout, simply because I love how they drown out the guitar riffs with white noise and howling wind. And the suprisingly restrained, down-tuned guitar solo is awesome; so is the organ-bass interplay found right after the chorus. Needless to say, this is one of John's songs.<br />Amazingly, this was the Beatles' last recorded work together, and even though they were all sick of each other at this time, they really did pull it together and make a true work of art that will never be forgotten. If you only want to buy one Beatles album (though if that's the case, I do recommend you get help), make it this one. No Beatles album is bad, and quite a few are masterpieces, but this outshines them all.avy).

B000NVIXDW|4.0|Buble is in good voice; he continues to mature in his presentation and<br />successfully presents ballads with uptempo songs.
B00000DOYH|3.0|Physical Graffiti is one of Led Zeppelin's most treasured recordings (then again, given this group's popularity even tripe like Presence is revered in some circles). It is also arguably the most bloated, indulgent, excessive double-album ever made. There are a mere fifteen songs on this album, and it runs over eighty minutes: 82:15, to be precise. And found within this double-album is a good single-album, too: some of these songs really are brilliant. I'll get to those. First, I'd like to dish out some criticism.<br />It should come as no surprise that two songs on this album take up about twenty minutes combined, and that they are the two worst songs on the album. First is In My Time of Dying, which breaks eleven minutes. I don't mind extremely long songs if they fulfill at least one of four criteria: intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics (Dylan's Desolation Row, Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands, Brownsville Girl and Highlands), create excellent atmosphere (Van Morrison's Madame George and T.B. Sheets), have virtuoso performances (Frank Zappa's Gumbo Variations and Watermelon in Easter Hay; several jazz songs), or have an arrangement that keeps you guessing (Isaac Hayes' late '60s-early '70s reinterpretations of pop hits; Yes' Close to the Edge). Occasionally, a song will fulfill all four: take either extended piece by the Doors (We'll use When the Music's Over simply because The End is overdiscussed). The lyrics are some of Morrison's best; the groove is the tightest and funkiest the band ever reached, and their chemistry is perfect; the drumming, organ playing and guitar playing are exceptional; and the song uses many unexpected dynamic shifts. In My Time, on the other hand, is just a bloated mess that would've made an enjoyable two-minute song. Sadly, the group indulges themselves completely with Jimmy Page playing repetitive, unimpressive guitar solos that are pure flash without any substance to back them up (a trap Page occasionally fell into, much as I respect him as a guitarist), not even bothering to shift tempos or keys. John Bonham's varied drumming does add interest, but it doesn't matter: I often zone out about five minutes before the piece ends.  It used to impress me, but now I can see it for what it is: a rudimentary tune stretched to the breaking point. If I wanted to hear Zeppelin go for epic lengths, I'd much rather play Achilles Last Stand, which is one of the group's best songs ever thanks to Page's downright inspired guitar playing. On the other hand, his playing on In My Time is simply inspid, as is Plant's monotonous delivery (come on, how many times does he say \\"Jesus gonna make up my dying bed\\"? Sure, it's a chorus, but does it really warrant THAT much repetition? Of course not). The other of the two is In the Light, which drags on for a similarly ludicrous nine minutes: a pretentious mix of pseudo-mystical lyrics, laughably bad \\"Eastern\\" synth parts, and boring guitar playing. This is simply the worst song Zeppelin ever made: again, only Bonzo's drumming is interesting, but that's not enough to lift it from the depths it sinks to. On a scale of zero to ten, I'd give it a 0.2, and that's only for the drumming. It blows.<br />So two songs are thouroughly awful, and several others are just bad: The Wanton Song has a special place in a lot of Zep fan's hearts, but I see it as boring macho posturing from my least favorite wannabe sex-god, Robert Plant. What else... let's see, Sick Again is a boring hard-rock song with no redeeming facets whatsoever; and Down By the Seaside is a pathetic attempt at country-rock by a band who shouldn't have explored the genre. Black Country Woman is okay, but it would've been made much better had someone besides Robert Plant sang it.<br />Now, for the goods. There is solid material here: Shake 'em on Down (Oops, I mean Custard Pie) is a fun brainless funk-rocker; Trampled Underfoot is another one, even if the clavinet riff is lifted straight from Superstition and (of course) uncredited. Kashmir is superb: I love the unpredictable, Indian-influenced arrangement and the metronome-like drumming: not even Plant's downright silly lyrics can stop it from being a good tune. Ten Years Gone is even better: my favorite on the album, a longing, symphonic, soulful guitar epic with some of Plant's more convincing vocals. My favorite part is the coda, where Page's guitar almost sounds like it's crying. Another fine one is Houses of the Holy, this one a straightahead rocker with an interesting riff and admittedly dumb lyrics. So, what else is new? Anyway, there are also some underrated songs here: the wistful acoustic guitar instrumental Bron-Yr-Aur should take up more of the airplay given to the infinitely inferior Communications Breakdown, and the mellow, organ-driven Night Flight should take up more of the airplay granted to the dreadfully dull Wanton Song. And Boogie with Stu is a lot of fun: indeed, the group gets down and boogies.<br />So this isn't brilliant or anything, but it has its moments. Would've made a great single album, though.Kashmir is superb: I love the unpredictable, Indian-influenced arrangement and the metronome-like drumming: not even Plant's downright silly lyrics can stop it from being a good tune.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|This is perhaps David Lynch's most courageous movie, for it is one of simple dialog, long sentences and a zen storyline of one man's decision to visit his ailing brother by driving a sit-down lawn mower several hundred miles. It is a slow road trip movie, without any special tricks, only the quest of one man with no overwhelming bits of conflicts or violence.<br /><br />Silences are not easy in movies, and yet they are expertly carried out here by a wonderful ensemble of cast and crew. Though Amazon mistakenly identifies this primarily as a Sissy Spacek movie, there is no doubt that this movie is the mantle for the late Richard Farnsworth.<br /><br />Farnsworth, whose face shows the emotions of a man making final journey, masterfully carries the movie in a way that is humble, haunting and sincere. His delivery of lines is quiet and gentle, as is his demeanor. A \\"slow road trip,\\" the pacing of the movie is compelling in part because of its quietude. Beautifully shot, the great blue skies and the miles of corn have an eloquence that only adds to meaning and depth.<br /><br />This is a movie that resonates, never shoving but gently prods us to think.<br />Of special note, Farnsworth was terminally ill during the shoot of this movie. In extreme pain, one can see the determination in his eyes. Sadly, in October 2000, Farnsworth died.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000F3WR The Grey Fox]] Movie<br />[[ASIN:0890134766 Making a Hand: Growing Up Cowboy in New Mexico]] Book<br />[[ASIN:0878424407 The Cowboy Kind]] Book<br />[[ASIN:1585441740 Cowboy Spur Maker: The Story of Ed Blanchard]] Book
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|I am not going to review the movie story quality.  I think it is a decent movie if you like history/war movies and also comic book adaptations.  So, I am not going to pretend to sway your opinion on the quality of the story, just bit on the quality of the HD DVD.    This is the only film besides Superman Returns that I have purchased on release for HD DVD (after owning a player for 1 year).  If you read the many Blu-Ray/HD DVD websites, animated films are rated well for picture quality since the source is usually digitally created.    I viewed this on an HD DVD drive on an XBox 360 at 720p and 1080p on a Sony 60\\" LCD projection TV.  The black hues are much better on the 1080p (maybe a reason to upgrade... or not).  There were few grainy images in the movie (you may possibly notice some edges between live actors and the backgrounds).  I also watched the DVD side in 480p just to compare.  The features on the HD DVD were more extensive, historical interviews, etc.  The image was much improved even using an Onkyo up converting to 1080i.  The sound effects are great on 7.1.      I have to tweak my Onkyo setup a bit since the sound seemed to diminish on dialogue.  The battle scenes sounded top notch.  I would seriously consider getting the HD DVD version since it is only about $25 on Amazon.  This would be one of the few movies out there that the high def version is much improved over the DVD since part of the visual source is digital.

6305546789|3.0|The most shocking Halloween-related thing ever -- with the possible exception of the joke about Mrs. Ghost not being able to get pregnant because Mr. Ghost had a hollow weenie. But in a respectable 2nd place, anyway, is Halloween, the horrifying tale of an evil madman named Mike Myers (as if his Simon character wasn't chilling enough) who terrorizes a babysitter by putting on a jumpsuit and hiding in the hedge. (A technique now widely used by custodians the world over.) Featuring the blood curdling theme song by director John Carpenter in which he hits a G on a piano key 900 times, then a C about 738 times and then hammers on the G for a time before hitting a G# and then starting the process over again and repeating it several hundred thousand times. Because he was too chicken to sit in the dark and watch it by himself, Mike enlisted the help of his old pal Kevin Murphy for this hilarious RiffTrax. You'll scream, you'll laugh, you'll jump out of your seat! (And then you should probably start watching the movie).
1594489505|3.0|First off, I really do admire Hosseini for writing a book like this (this goes for The Kite Runner, as well). To attempt to make the American reader familiar with a culture that seems so foreign is a task in itself, but to write a book that is at the same time interesting and popular is quite an achievement indeed. His writing style is fairly simple but informative at the same time, which is a highly enjoyable combination and makes for a quick read.     My problem with this book in the story. I really can't say how the situation is in Afghanistan simply because I'm so unfamiliar with the country, but it seems to me no one's life could be so relentlessly sad as in this book. The story tells the intertwined tales of two Afghan women, and chapter after chapter is just endless beating on these women, their families, their loves, to the point that I wasn't attached to anyone in this book knowing that any glimmer of hope and happiness was to be squashed in a few pages. As I said, I don't know how true this is to real life (and I'm probably doing a disservice to Afghans whose lives are like this on a regular basis), but, as a STORY it minimized my enjoyment. Plus, the characters sometimes take a backseat to the events and to the history Hosseini tries to weave in, which, combined with the fact that tragedy is inevitably around the corner, didn't make me care much for them at the end of the book.     Overall a solid, informative read and worth your time, but for myself, I like a little more sunshine in my books (or, at least, a little less darkness).
B000AYELVA|3.0|On the shadowy periphery of society lives a secret organization of mutants - despised, deformed and loathed, they live in fear of a nation that holds them in contempt. They are comic book fans. And one of their favorites is X-Men, which tells the tale of a secret organization headed by Professor Charles Xavier, master of the mysterious brain device known as Cerebro and ideological enemy of the metal-manipulating villain Magneto. It's all very neat-o.<br /><br />Featuring the extremely British performances of Patrick Stewart (Robin Hood: Men in Tights) and Sir Ian McKellan (Last Action Hero), X-Men tries its altogether best to maintain some shred of dignity even while adults with names like Cyclops and Storm leap around in spandex suits fighting other adults named Toad and Magneto. There's a lot to work with, so Mike enlisted the help of his MST3K co-star Bill Corbett for this hilarious RiffTrax!

B000N3ST9I|5.0|I have read so many album reviews by supposed 'experts' over the years - magazine writers, internet know-it-alls etc - that I tend to be very cynical when they start raving about any new metal album. \\"It's the best album of the year !\\" ... \\"It's the greatest thing since 'Master of Puppets'\\" ... \\"These are the new kings of metal\\" ... blah, blah, blah ... Heard it all before - and sorry but most of the time the 'experts' have simply got it wrong. The last album that wet Metal Hammer's pants was Mastodon's 'Blood Mountain', for example. Yes, it was good - but hardly the greatest thing since sliced bread like Hammer felt it was. The same goes for a long list of other critics' favorites.    So you'll excuse my cynical response when Machine Head's \\"The Blackening\\" was given the same treatment by all the press. Suddenly, this was the \\"classic, must have album of the 21st Century\\". No, really? Heck, call me an older generation metal fan - but I had hardly ever heard of Machine Head before this. Looks like just any other metalcore band at first glance. Surely, the critics have gotten over-excited again over just another run-of-the-mill album.    Boy, was I wrong.    Simply put, \\"The Blackening\\" really is fantastic. I heard just the demo of \\"Now I Lay Thee Down\\" and was instantly captivated. The music was so good, I simply couldn't get it out of my head. I bought the album - and it far exceeded all expectations. This was a work of art ! Every song was strong and there are no weak links in the entire album. Each of the 8 songs have their individual, catchy character. Keeping them all tied together is the incredible riffing and surprisingly melodic flavor. This wasn't just angry shouting - the vocals span an exciting range from mad metal torment to moments of beautifully crooned singing. The guitars riff and roar as hard and heavy as anything in the metal world, yet do not lose sight of providing actually entertaining music that is - dare I say - very pleasant to listen to. I got the impression I was listening to the natural evolution and maturation of the thrash I grew up with. It was still energetic and powerful as anything back in the Metallica heyday - but was now infused with a more seasoned grasp of melody and pathos. My jaw dropped. For once, the critics were actually right. This is great.    I was greatly surprised by my fondness for this album. I am not usually a fan of 'this type' of metal. I tend to prefer classic metal (Maiden) or old school thrash (early Metallica). Maybe I'm just getting old. I never really got the hang of shouted, harsh vocals - I always liked 'clean' vocals instead. My favorite current band is Dragonforce (yes, I know ... cheesy etc etc). So I guess I'm not your typical Machine Head fan. But I just couldn't stop head-banging to \\"The Blackening\\". It feels insane. For someone who is not a Machine Head fan - and who had never heard of the band just a few months ago - I am suddenly converted. And I just ordered a Machine Head T-shirt !    My favorite song is still \\"Now I Lay Thee Down\\" - probably the most beautifully melodic yet heavily pounding romantic rock song I've heard this decade. \\"Aesthetics of Hate\\" will get most of the publicity - being one of the shorter songs that is being marketed heavily by Roadrunner. It certainly has the raw aggression and naked power to attract younger head-bangers, but it has the awe-inspiring, masterful riffery to appeal to more discerning afficionados. Speaking of riffs, those on \\"Cleching the Fists of Dissent\\" easily rank among the great riffs of the last 10 years - tuneful, memorable and utterly enjoyable. At over 10 minutes long, \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" was quite obviously written to be an epic - and it succeeds. It is beautifully crafted, wonderfully performed and is 'epic' in every sense of the word. In fact, every song on this album is just immensely great to listen to. I simply can't stop playing it.    Personally, I would agree with anyone who now says \\"The Blackening\\"is the album of the year. It trumps anything else I heard this year by a very wide margin. I would go as far as to put this album squarely amongst my personal favorite 10 metal albums of all time. Maybe others won't rate this album as highly. But take it from me: I'm a cynic who distrusts glowing reviews, I'm someone who has never heard of Machine Head before this year, I usually prefer 'classic' metal with cleaner vocls than this ... and yet even I can get so excited by the album. I hope that tells you something - this is a special album that may convert you even if you are a non-believer.
B000QFCD5O|4.0|The liner notes give ASIA the dubious distinction of being the template for all succeeding arena rock acts, Aerosmith, BonJovi, etc. Not sure I'd want to take a bow for that, but, there you have it. ASIA, however, was a one or two off project for those recovering from ELP, Yes and King Crimson. It is still very much in the YES framework, as evidenced by the Roger Dean artwork, Steve Howe and the rhythm of the music itself. Geoff Downes ahd a brief tour of duty with YES during the DRAMA fiasco, Palmer was relieved to be free of the excessive indulgences of Lake and Emerson, Wetton had landed on his feet after both KC (where he managed to be the only bassist to overwhelm Fripp) and UK (with Bruford, his rhythm section collaborator in KC) and the aforementioned Howe, who was coming off the less than stellar GTR assignation. Four very accomplished msuicians put together a record that surprised everybody with its success. A second followed. Touring was never something they were keen on, so the group faded and would later become a Downes vehicle.  So in 2006, at a meeting in Londan, the 4 decided to have one more go at it, and did an initial tour, whcih again surprised everyone. The tour was expanded and this record was recorded in March 2006 before a very sympathetic, and at times too polite, crowd in Tokyo. The recording is pristine, the seperation is well defined, and the songs are delivered with commitment. This will not win anyone over, but it is a testament to teh staying power of the four of them.  That said, there are some odd choices of tunes, most notable, \\"Fanfare for the Common Man,\\" and \\"Court of the CK\\", the latter for the fact that none of the four of them had any connection with this tune except for being alive at the same time. You would think Wetton might lead them on \\"Fracture\\", \\"Red\\" or even \\"Starless\\" (I would love to hear Howe's take on that tune). ITCOTHCK is certainly a signature tune, but not for ASIA. As such, it lacks a certain conviction in itsdelivery. Fripp often described playing with Wetton as being challenged by the most formidable bassist and strongest singer in rock music. When you consider what he did with some old Genesis chestnuts on the Steve Hackett retro, it is easy to see how he can make you forget, not only who the original bassist was, but who the original singer was as well. In the case of \\"Roundabout\\" he alters the song enough for you to erase the choirboy vovals we usually associate with it. PLus, who the hell was Squire? \\"Fanfare\\" is a bit of progressive bombast that doesn't serve anyone well. Riffing on a few of the themes from Copland's composition, it really doesn't especially showcase Palmer well, and tends to recall all that excess. Palmer fares much better on teh second disc with a drum solo that actually advances the musical ideas, a rare accomplishment for any drum solo, this side of Bill Bruford. The skeletal Howe still possesses the most amazing set of hands and whether they are at the service of acoustic blues, classical music or this brand of rock, you have to step back in wonder. As I say, I would have loved to hear him take on a piece like \\"Starless\\" or \\"Fracture.\\"  I enjoyed the disc, and if you are someone with an avocation for this kind of thing, you will be well satisfied. Yesterday, August 8, 2007, word came out that the current our is on hold until Wetton recovers from some heart related ailments. We can only wish him well. He is a dominant force in Brit/rock of any description and Music itself is less without his contributions.

B000FNNHUM|5.0|What a fantastic CD/DVD set! The CD is just as I remember the album, plus the fantastic bonus tracks. The DVD is something else again!<br />With full length concert footage from a show in San Francisco, an interview with Steve Miller & a new, Dolby 5.1 mix of the album, no music fan should be without this historic album, period.
B000E1ZK50|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theater, so I looked forward to the DVD release. The DVD transfer was a big disappointment since the dark scenes came out grayish and pixelated. A good portion of this movie takes place at night because of Dracula and the werewolf, but the bad transfer was particularly noticeable in the beginning during the Jekyll & Hyde scene. When I found out that this title is available on HD-DVD, I decided to get it right away, and I was not disappointed. The transfer was way better and you could appreciate the dark scenes the way they were intended. The great thing about high definition movies is that the colors are more vivid and black in particular has more depth, which gives the image on screen more contrast and clarity. It is true as well in this movie. If you enjoyed this movie, the only way to appreciate it on video is through HD-DVD.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|While the american version is dubbed over by Sigourney Weaver the original BBC version is narrated by one of the worlds best known broadcasters and naturalists, David Attenborough. Through 11 episodes you get an in depth look into different places and species of our planet that most people never knew existed. Being the first nature documentary shot in almost all high-definition format you also get an amazing view if you have an HD-DVD player. I was absolutely amazed at how clear the picture was and absolutely love the series. The quality of the production is so good, you will be watching it over and over again with your friends and family.
0060763280|4.0|Eker has written a sound book on having the right mind-set to be successful.    He is a little over the top in making being rich the point of it all, but tries to balance it by saying that rich is in the eye of the beholder.  Financial independence requires enough assets that generate income in excess of our expenses.  He sells his workshops pretty hard also, but if you can get past that, and focus on his core message - making your mind ready to gain and retain wealth, you can use this book to help focus on whatever you have determined is important in your life.

B000RIHBIE|4.0|Underclass Hero is Sum 41's most radio-friendly album, and that is not a bad thing.  The title track is classic Sum 41 pop-punk.  The single, \\"Walking Disaster,\\" is half-ballad, half-Blink-182.      On this album, the band has developed a tendency towards softer, more sensitive material.  \\"Best of Me\\" is the full-on love ballad that the band was destined to do at one time or another.  \\"With Me\\" functions more as a power ballad, while album closer \\"So Long Goodbye\\" is a great nostalgic acoustic track.      While Sum 41's previous releases suggested that the band was headed toward a heavier sound with each album, this release changes its direction towards pop-punk again and places them in the same genre as bands such as Green Day.  Actually, it is hard not to compare Sum 41 to Green Day when listening to this album.  Songs such as \\"March of the Dogs,\\" with its political commentary, resemble the progression that Green Day took with American Idiot.  Even some of the song titles recall of past Green Day songs, but that has nothing to do with the music.    Being Sum 41's most accessible album, the band is likely to enjoy some more mainstream success and gain new fans with this release.  No new ground is broken here, but almost every track catches the ear and that makes for a good listen.

B000063Y8F|4.0|I am very happy with this garlic press -- when you press garlic, it releases the oils, so I am tasting much more flavor than my previous method of chopping garlic. I am tired of buying substandard kitchen gadgets that don't work and decided I will only purchase top of the line products from now on -- as a ONE time purchase, as I expect it to last! This garlic press is one of those top of the line purchases and worth it. Naturally, you have to clean out the remaining garlic -- and I read complaints on that -- but DUH -- it's not magic....that is the case with all garlic presses. The most important thing is that it presses the garlic out.
B000RIWAYY|5.0|Even 20 years ago the exremely fluid,melodic,original guitar stylings of this legend were already in full bloom. It's so strange to see Satriani with a full head of hair and no shades, but at the same time takes you back on a nostalgic trip to when we first heard and saw this great guitar player. The sound on the remastered CD is much crisper and spacious and hearing it again in this remastered format will be a sonic treat. The DVD from the 1988 Montreaux Jazz Festival is alone worth the price of this package. Excellent footage and excellent sound coupled with superb perfomances make this a must have in your collection. Get it!
B000SO7OMA|5.0|The reason why I am reviewing this nearly before its release here in the UK is that I saw Loreena McKennitt in her only UK concert at London's Barbican Theatre on 3 April. After a magnificent evening, I bought a copy of the CD/DVD set for £25 at the tour sales stand. Paying the extra for having the set before the official release date is money well spent.     The concert was recorded in September 2006 at the Alhambra Palace in Granada. It must be said that Loreena's music melds beautifully with the backdrop of the palace and whoever had the idea for the concert here was truly inspired.     There are 18 tracks on the album - the 2 CDs - and the order is the same for the DVD. There is a commentary by Loreena at intervals throughout the concert and you get a real understanding of how her mind works, in putting together the historical images which shape her albums; each album being a history lesson and a travelogue for her research which culminates in her marvellous albums.     There are tracks from all her studio albums:     * Penelope's Song\\", \\"Caravanserai\\" and \\"Never-Ending Road (Amhran Duit)\\" are all from \\"An Ancient Muse\\", the brilliant new album;     * \\"The Mystic's Dream\\", \\"The Bonny Swans\\" and \\"Santiago\\" are from \\"The Mark And Mirror\\";     * \\"She Moved Through The Fair\\" and \\"Stolen Child\\" are from \\"Elemental\\";     * \\"The Mummer's Dance\\", \\"Marco Polo\\" and \\"Dante's Prayer\\" are from \\"The Book Of Secrets\\";     * \\"Bonny Portmore\\", \\"All Souls Night\\", an abbreviated version of \\"The Lady Of Shalott\\", \\"The Old Ways\\" and \\"Cymbeline\\" are all from \\"The Visit\\"; and     * \\"Huron 'Beltane' Fire Dance\\" is from \\"Parallel Dreams\\".     Finally, there is a wonderful version of \\"Raglan Road, the poem written by Patrick Kavanagh.     The musicians are a stellar A-list group, including many of those who have played on Loreena's studio albums - Brian Hughes, Caroline Lavelle, Donald Qwan, Hugh Marsh to name just a few. However, there are many more top-class musicians playing here andwhen you add Loreena's voice, the result is startlingly wonderful and unforgettable.     This is a major concert in a magnificent setting - a spectacular occasion which all fans will enjoy. For all British fans, it is hoped that Loreena will return for more concerts soon. I guess the same will go for her fans on the other side of the pond (and the rest of the world!).

0783231032|4.0|1941 was one of the most underrated comedies ever. Now I will be honest, this is not an award winner by any means. The plot goes nowhere and is scattered all over the place. However the actors in the film make some of the most memorable characters in movie history! The late, great John Belushi is perfectly cast as the highly unstable Capt. Wild Bill Kelso.(Although his lack of screen time is dissapointing.) Belushi gives one of his best performances in the role. Other highlights are all of the scenes involving the Japanese submarine crew and their captain( another brillant performance by the legendary Toshiro Mifune), Robert Stack as the general trying to hold everyone together in this time of panic. And of course the hilarious scenes involving Ned Beatty fireing from his front yard onto the Japanese submarine! I laugh everytime I watch that part. I felt that the DVD suffers from the addtional scenes that were added back in. While watching the movie I could see why they were cut. They are pretty much pointless to the rest of the film and are not the least bit funny. If you watch this movie just take the time to look at each individual storyline and you will see the humor in it and find it quite enjoyable. If you try to figure out how they are all going to tie in together and figure out the entire plot, then you are in for some real dissapointment. One of the special features I thought was entertaining was the reprints of the reviews that critics gave this film when it was released. Wow! Its a good thing Steven Speilberg had Jaws to help him out before this because he got no mercy from the critics on this one! Worth watching a few times before you judge it too harshly.
0316166685|3.0|This book got a lot of undeserving hype.  Some parts of the book were very magical, where as other parts were unnecessary, and ridiculous.  This book is written in a way that I do not envision heaven.  Maybe that is why I only liked the book, and would not call it a must read.
0761119752|4.0|I've been reading this to my now 14-month old for several months as a bedtime story--now, when he's ready to go to bed, he brings me this book! It makes him laugh and I haven't gotten tired of it even after all these months. While of course babies are going to bend the covers of any book, the Boynton books with cutouts (particularly this one) suffer the worst; the cover is about to rip in two. I wish they had just made this with a solid cover and then I would give it 5 stars.  Fortunately, it's cheap enough that I'll just buy another copy when this one is worn out.
0316010669|4.0|I just got the book and I am about halfway through, but already I can see 'blink' working in everyday situations. A great book if your looking for a better understanding of how your brain works. My only complaint is the Gladwell has a tendency to be a bit repetitive, making it a slightly tedious read, but still well worth the time.
0345350499|3.0|There are significant errors of fact in this version of the King Arthur<br />tale. For me it is more like a parallel worlds sci fi/ fantasy  than the historical poetry. Here everybody it related in =some very strange ways!<br />Lancelot is Arthur's cousin, for instance (not even remotely related<br />as far as I know in any other version!). Vivian who is mostly known for<br />her magically penning Merlin inside a mountain cave is the Lady of the Lake.<br />Taliesin is named as Merlin (two different people again).<br />The cult of the Goddess is pretty much made up here<br />and seems not even remotely related to the Celtic and Druid traditions<br />as found in most other sources. Mostly Marion Zimmer Bradley<br />did some nice research about place names then got everything<br />pretty terribly wrong. The Movie[[ASIN:B00005QW5Y The Mists of Avalon]]<br />with some minor deviations like when Morgaine finds she has slept with her half brother Arthur, she recognizing him then not later.<br />Turning Merlin to the same side as the witches and evil plotters against the kingdom just doesn't ring true.  Arthur who was Celtic and Roman<br />in origin and was Welsh did fight according to Churchill via Nennius<br />12 battles (probably against Saxon, Pictish and Scottish assailants).<br />Most of the \\"localizations\\" of this book are questionable, too,<br />except that the bones of Arthur are claimed by Glastonbury Abbey.<br />I guess the idea was to make it a tale that held together<br />instead of the historically short unlocalized individual tales later gathered as poetry.

B000MXPE7O|1.0|A beautifully filmed piece of worthless sheet of Anti-American propaganda: Leni Riefenstahl would be proud.<br /><br />Back in the old days (pre-1940), Ivy League schools weren't meritocracies but sylvan glades where the sons of wealthy East Coast patricians gambolled and frolicked before taking their rightful place running government and corporations like the good oligarchs they were. And this film purports to get to the psychological and sociological roots of how very very evil all that was....and still is.<br /><br />Which is why it is a beautifully gilded crock of smelly horse pucky, with clouds of green bottle flies dining on its moist putrid reek. It was so bad I could not stop watching, and eventually started laughing.<br /><br />For those of you who want to cut-to-the chase for the thesis here is the stunning, original, insightful, startling, brave, rebellious, and groundbreaking insight this monumental film contributes to history (the \\"Oscar\\" statuette for the first time-ever! bends at the waist and bows his head)......<br /><br />...........shhhhhhh....sshhhhhhhhhh.....De Niro is about to pronounce... (a kind of hush falls over humanity as we anticipate this genius .....as he proclaims the dawn of a new age with his word)....<br /><br />\\"WASPs are evil.\\"<br /><br />There it is. The WASP sense of entitlement, noblesse oblige, privilege, power ...it is all a mask for murderous racist misogynistic eugenic horror. These guys don't need triple-K hoods because they have old school ties instead.<br /><br />Okay, the good things: this is a beautifully filmed movie, with absolutely lovely sets, the art direction and the cinematography and yes, even the direction is excellent.<br /><br />Tammy Blanchard is stunning as Laura, an old girlfriend of the hero whose presence and then absence from his life provides leitmotifs of loss throughout. Her performance alone is worth watching this film, and she was so good I'm going to seek out her other work just based on what she did here.<br /><br />William Hurt is particularly well-cast as a leading patrician spook and delivers his usual good performance.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is okay, but you can't ever get into her character because De Niro's direction, and her wardrobe, and her makeup all were carefully constructed to say only one thing and one thing loudly \\"HEY LOOK! WE GOT ANGELINA JOLIE IN THIS PICTURE! PRETTY SWEET, EH?!\\" it is impossible to forget that it is *her* and not *her*character*.<br /><br />The minor characters outshine the stars throughout. Joe Pesci is dead on in a small artful cameo (and I usually hate him) where he creates a *character* that is different from himself. You actually have to blink to make sure it is him.<br /><br />Which brings us to Matt Damon, who mysteriously does not appear in this film. Why De Niro cast the Damon puppet from Trey Parker and Matt Stone's \\"Team America: World Police\\" for the lead role will perhaps forever remain a mystery in annuls of Movianna (perhaps budget constraints is the explanation).<br /><br />The Damon puppet gives a credible but wooden performance in its limited, expressionless, range. And perhaps this was De Niro's goal. But the difficulty is the blank grain of the barely painted static wood block simply doesn't point to any interior conflict that is the entire subtext and purpose of the film. Other critics have projected their own emotional reactions to the *script* and *plot* onto the puppet's performance, but even with clever lighting and muted shadows (all stolen from Riefenstahl and German expressionism) the puppet remains, well, a puppet. Its ceaseless repetition of the one line \\"Matt Damon\\" got pretty tiresome, as were the 50's style half-horn rim glasses superglued to its ears. De Niro simply went overboard in trying to cast for a wooden performance, but we can suppose he did not want to take the risk of having a flesh and blood actor who might comprehend what was going on.<br /><br />Which leads to the otherbad things in the film (a list of endless clich&eacute;'s begins here): WASPs are emotionless, secret societies are evil, wealth is abused, cripples and blacks are not worthy of the love of gods, government is there for the privileged, WASPS are actually cyrpto-Nat-zees, women aren't worthy of respect and are nothing but breed cows and catchers mitts for our genetic sputum, etc.<br /><br />But the biggest, unresolved, and forever bizarre bug-a-boo of Hollywood is a thesis that is paradoxical and has mutually exclusive axioms:  The CIA is so powerful it can do anything and it is simultaneously an organization of incompetent buffoons motivated to do foolish counterproductive and damaging things. The Good Shepherd manages to make the case for both ideas and as far as I can tell, is serious.<br /><br />I really could not stop laughing. This is the biggest pot of poo I have ever seen, and if there is a single creative or original idea in the whole mess of twaddle, I'll be flummoxed if I could find it. Like the boy happily and energetically digging through a pile of manure expecting to find a pony at the bottom of it, I kept watching. But nope, as the credits rolled it became flabbergastingly evident that De Niro was serious and this was his real expression and intent.<br /><br />Your time would be better spent making shadow puppets with your hands and naming lefty \\"clich&eacute;\\" and righty \\"Jolie\\" unless you, like myself and \\"Sprockets\\" Dieter say:<br /><br />\\"Did you mean for me to scream?\\"vil, wealth is abused, cripples and blacks are not worthy of the love of gods, government is there for the privileged, WASPS are actually cyrpto-Nat-zees, women aren't worthy of respect and are nothing but breed cows and catchers mitts for our genetic sputum, etc.    But the biggest, unresolved, and forever bizarre bug-a-boo of Hollywood is a thesis that is paradoxical and has mutually exclusive axioms:  The CIA is so powerful it can do anything and it is simultaneously an organization of incompetent buffoons motivated to do foolish counterproductive and damaging things.

0975991477|3.0|As a reader well-versed in What the Bleep, Abraham-Hicks, and Candace Pert's excellent Molecules of Emotion (which I found more scientific); I am comfortable with new-age medical concepts. However, Lipton's boldest statement is that you can completely overcome genetics. While I don't believe one is doomed by their genetics, I think the other extreme is to say you can completely \\"rewire\\" them. Research regarding human's having a \\"Happiness Set-Point\\" would indicate that reality is somewhere in the middle. I agree that our choices can work with, or against, our genetics; but to state we can reinvent them...<br />It's a radical, interesting book; though I didn't experience it completely as a medically scientific one.
B000063S6Z|3.0|I have a hard time listening to this album's \\"18\\" tracks in one sitting.  The overall tone and sound gets monotoneous and quickly grinds on my nerves.   I consider \\"Jam for the Ladies\\" to be the only dud.  However, there are not any really great tracks on 18 either.  Something fans of Moby's previous albums have come to expect.  Most of the tracks are average with five or six being slightly better than average (tracks 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 17), but even these are more enjoyable when heard interspersed on a personal playlist rather than on Moby's 18 album.    3.5/5 stars.

B000K4WPCC|2.0|\\"The Covenant\\" is the kind of movie that could have been better and should have been better, and yet leaves you wanting.  The basic storyline could have worked, but whether due to poor scripting, poor direction or poor acting, in the end, it just doesn't come together.  The Sons of Ipswich are a small group of 4 teen boys who are privileged, drive amazingly expensive cars or motorcycles and attend a preppy Goth co-ed boarding school.  They are just like the other kids, with one glaring exception - - because they have been descended from certain Ipswich, Massachusetts residents of the 1600s, they are \\"blessed\\" with warlock-like powers, which enable them to do all sorts of teen boy cool things, like outrun the police, fly off cliffs and cause the short skirts of teen girls to fly up, revealing their panty choice - - if any. Their world gets turned upside down when a boy is found dead and the Sons of Ipswich begin having strange visions.  Is it because they are preparing to turn 18, when they allegedly come into their full powers?  Or is it the new boy in town?    Despite a few cool special effects and some moments that lead you to believe something scary is happening, \\"The Covenant\\" really fails to deliver.  Nothing truly scary happens and some of the special effects aren't really explained.  The film tends to drag on in parts and made me wish that it would hurry up and get to the \\"good stuff\\" - - which failed to materialize.  The female roles are little more than window dressing as the movie belongs to the male characters - - although the acting, all around, is inconsistent and not wholly convincing.    All in all, the movie feels choppy - - almost as though huge sections were edited out.  Too much time is spent showcasing the various leads hanging out, in school, etc. when not enough background is given.  How did they get these powers?  Exactly what is going to happen to them when they turn 18?  How did one of their fathers die?  Basically, the movie is too light and fluffy, and not dark enough to really grip you.    If you want a goth/witches/warlock/vampire movie with a teen cast that has a good story, get \\"The Lost Boys\\" instead.  \\"The Covenant\\" will only leave you disappointed.

B000OPOANE|1.0|Well, I have to confess I wanted to be blown away.  Sadly this was not to be.  My big gripe here is that although the stereo mix is in Advanced Resolution the Surround mix is a pitiful Dolby Digital mix - and you can really hear the drop in quality here. Why was this decision taken - the furore if the stereo mix was in MP3 only would be deafening yet Surround fans are expected to be grateful for the equivalent of MP3.  The trouble is that if we boycott this, the labels will say there is no demand for surround, but if we buy it they assume we are okay about lousy quality.  The much-touted MVI is a waste of time & effort unless MP3 and ringtones are your thing.   I could not even register my comments because I do not have a US or canadian postcode, so that is also a waste of time.    Shame - the stereo is superb, but the loss of resolution in surround makes me weep it is that bad.  If you are a surround fan, avoid this - it is a waste of money.
0440238609|4.0|Fantastic series.  I just hope the 2007-08 film doesn't ruin it.  You may not like the end of the series, I don't, but everyhting else makes it worth it.  I beleive that the first book is the best.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|This show takes the audience on a bit of a backwards journey down memory lane. The premise has the narrator (Ted) telling his two children the story of how he met their mother. Along the way we meet Lilly and Marshall (known to each other by the sickeningly sweet nicknames Marshmellow and Lillypad) who are a funny, picture perfect cute couple (well...they are now, anyway, after their relationship trouble in season 1). We also meet Robin (Ted's on again, off again girlfriend who turns out *not* to be his future wife) and that rascally womanizing egomaniac, Barney.<br /><br />I think the casting in this show was outstanding. Neil Patrick Harris shines as Barney, and Alyson Hannigan puts forth a brilliant performance each episode as Lilly. The character of Ted is a good fit for Josh Radnor (who we have thus far only seen in small bit parts in various films, such as [[ASIN:B0009P42WI Not Another Teen Movie (Unrated Director's Cut)]]. Jason Segal and Cobie Smulders round out the cast nicely as Marshall and Robin. (and if you think you might recognize the voice of the \\"older Ted Mosbey\\" during the narrating portion of the show...it's probably because you do. The narrator is actually Bob Saget).<br /><br />Season 2 pretty much picks up where season 1 left off. In a bizarre case of cold feet, Lilly breaks off her engagement with Marshall and moves to California for an art internship. Marshall is left in New York, alone and heartbroken, while Robin and Ted strike out in their new relationship (despite the fact that they both know they want very different things out of life). Barney, as always, provides much of the comic relief throughout the show, and remains his usual womanizing self. Season 2, from start to finish, is hilarious. I particularly enjoyed the episodes \\"Ted Mosbey, Architect\\" and (my all time favorite episode so far) \\"Robin Sparkles\\". When you watch them, you'll see why (I seriously couldn't erase the episode Robin Sparkes from my TiVo for like a month, because I just kept re-watching it!).<br /><br />The dialogue is sharp and witty, and the interpersonal relationships within the group are really fun to watch. I can't ever get through an episode without laughing out loud at least once, and I think thats a good sign for a comedy sitcom. This is situational comedy at it's finest, and while the storylines and situations aren't believable in an apply-it-to-real-life sort of way, it's nonetheless entertaining and humorous, which is sort of the point.<br /><br />The season 1 box set contained at least 5 episodes with writer/director/producer commentary (with the season finale episode containing commentary from the 5 principle actors). Hopefully season 2 will have the same, because a lot of the commentary is really entertaining!<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a great show. I'm going out on a limb here (a very high, terrifying limb) but I think this show has the potential to at least partially fill the shoes of shows like \\"Friends\\" and \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\", as far as filling the half-hour comedy sitcom void is concerned. Give it a try, and I promise you won't be disappointed.watching it!).     The dialogue is sharp and witty, and the interpersonal relationships within the group are really fun to watch.

6302763835|5.0|This is a classic 50's sci-fi movie about a giant tarantula terrorizing a small town. Very good special effects and a very well written story make this one a top notch sci-fi adventure! Look close in the final moments of the film as it is a young Clint Eastwood who saves the day as the jet squadron leader who saves the day! Even when he was just starting out he was a hero! This is a must have movie and is part of a 5 movie collection called Classic Sci Fi Ultimate Collection! Don't confused this with \\"Earth VS the Spider\\" which is good too! The DVD transfer is sweet! \\"CB\\" Harry saves the day again!
B00005R1N3|5.0|I received this product in very good condition, although it took a while for the order to reach me.    I am a huge horror movie buff, and I have to say this was a very scary movie!  Definately, a movie to watch over and over!
B000002C25|4.0|This album was a great deception. The songs are too long, and some of them could be easily cut of the album (My Big Mouth, I Hope I Think I Know, Fade In/Out). Others could be reduced to 4 minutes, and then they would be classics (Stand By Me, All Around The World, It´s Getting Better Man). And at least one b-side should be on the album, \\"Stay Young\\", from the first single, \\"D´You Know What I Mean?\\". But looking back over 10 years, this is a great album, even with so many problems and overproduction. It´s strange that the singles work so much better than the album, and it´s because some songs are really very good. If the album was about 20 minutes shorter, it would be one of the best albuns in the nineties. Anyway, it was a great mistake, but it is a great album, and definitely worth listening.
B000N0WCLC|4.0|Just an overall great flick. I originally saw this on DVD, and then saw it again on blu-ray. Remember something folks, it's not about the disc content, it's about the movie. I remember when I used to be so excited about special features, or a re-release with tons of added bonuses. After a while, it's becomes boring and annoying. It's about the movie.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this movie! It has just enough romantic air, humor, troublesome twists and drama to keep me on the edge of my seat! I first rented this movie, and then knew I had to buy it.

0385522401|5.0|A marriage is about to start and then fails on square one because both antagonists don't really know what is what regarding the physical side of it, and though neither is an illiterate yokel, they don't manage to rationalize it enough to talk their way through it.<br />Hard to believe this is set only about 45 years ago. It reads as if it was a lot older. Some reviewers have problems with that. They seem to think this is not real. This can not be the 60s of the 20th.<br />But my own recollection confirms to me: this is how it was, then. The wordlessness, the embarrassment, the fear. The shame. What a breakthrough the much maligned 'sexual revolution' of a few years later was. It brought freedom for many, freedom from the paralysis of Chesil Beach. To me, this story of complete disaster in a relationship reads entirely true.<br />(Just in case, I don't deny that the 'sexual revolution' brought us some other trouble in its wake, but that's besides the point now. And maybe it was not all that bad after all, right.)<br />There is one caveat: how do we know that the woman's problems would not have been the same 10 years later? Sometimes a short term problem, i.e. the speechlessness, just paints over the long term problem. What if she couldn't have been different under any circumstances? That's a possible reading which IME does not even imply. Which does not reduce the high level of enjoyment and interest of the book.
0895260131|4.0|This book is very informative and interesting and easily read.  I think all who are not Muslim should read it to get a better understanding of this religion and some of the history that has come to pass because of its being.  Those of us who are not of the Islamic faith should be aware of what we are really up against.  Because not all, but many Muslims lean more toward the fanitic than the moderate views and we (who are not Muslim) are all at risk due to this enormous fraction of powerful fanitics.  However, I think this book was written with a slant in mind and when reading we must keep this in mind.
B000K7UBTI|1.0|I am clueless how anyone can claim to enjoy The Invincible China-Man (I mean Iron Man).  This movie was just pure garbage.<br /><br />Where to begin?  How about the box that clearly shows a Red-Yellow Armored Iron Man battling the Mandrin.  YEAH!  That never happens any where in the movie.  Instead we get Iron-Man trapsing around the globe gathering up the rings of the Mandarin before his Elementals (the weak excuse of a lazy writer to choose 4 villains with element powers) can reach them.  I think I saw this exact same plot in one of the G.I. Joe cartoons from the 1980's.<br /><br />So much of the movie is spent on the completely unimportant story of Li Mei that I was beginning to question whose movie this truly was.  The movie is 80-minutes.  About 77-minutes leads to the build up of the appearance of the Mandarin.  And when he shows up does he battle Iron-Man?  Not really.  He throws him around until Li Mei has the power to defeat him.  PLEASE!  Did the makers of this movie want us to feel it had much of a connection to Iron-Man?  THE Iron-Man!  Marvel Comic's Iron-Man!<br /><br />I could rant all day long but suffice to say that the movie is PG-13.  Now understand it is NOT for kids.  Unless you want your kid to see Tony Stark in a hot tub with a woman (naked), Tony showering (naked) in front of Pepper his secretary, Li Mei remembering the time she tried to commit suicide by looking at her wrist scars, and a man slapping a woman around because she's not a Man-Child.  Of course, the movie isn't really for an adult with any semblance of intelligence because the plot is dull, the music LAME-O, Iron-Man battling a dragon shouldn't be the focus...fighting the Mandarin should be the focus, most of it feels childish, and it's just NOT a good movie nor one that should be connected to the Marvel Comics character.  Marvel needed to make a simple decision is this for KIDS or ADULTS.  They failed for both markets.<br /><br />I hated this DVD!  Shame on you Marvel for allowing junk like this to pollute the shelf of my video store and tarnish a good character!<br /><br />Just awful!shelf of my video store and tarnish a good character!    Just awful!
1594489505|5.0|An outstanding book. Certainly one of the \\"Must Reads\\" of the year.  Maybe better than The Kite Runner...Maybe...But when books are at this level, it serves no purpose to compare. It is enough to be among the \\"best,\\" as these books certainly are...     The man, Khaled Hosseini, can tell a story, one that is moving and insightful, teaching the readers about traditions and pratices of another culture while, at the same time, engrossing the reader in the lives, joys, dreams and struggles of human existence and endeavor in that new and strange culture.    This book, about two women in Afghanistan, the Afghanistan of the Soviets, the Taliban and post (I hope) Taliban, drops to the depths of human degregation and misery and soars to the heights of human hope, sacrifice, achievement and accomplishment bordering on victory.  It is about life with hope, without hope and, in the end, a new found purpose for existence.  A truly outstanding book.    Put it this way: \\"I'm a 61-year old white guy, born in the South, living in the South, with no first-hand knowledge or experience with Afghan culture.  I finished the book while parked in the Winn Dixie parking lot while my wife was grocery shopping, hence the title of this review. When I closed the book, I was crying tears of joy, admiration and, as strange as it may seem, sorrow and respect.  Other men have relayed these same emotions and depth of feeling.     A great, great book.  I don't see how Mr. Hosseini can have a third book this moving, but I can hope....Those of us who have read \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" all hope....

0061120081|5.0|Like fine wine, it gets better and better...    It had been more than 40 years since last visiting Atticus, Scout, Jem, Tom Robinson and Boo Radney.  I had forgotten how much I loved them, how real they were, and how much they moved me...    Having grown up in times like those described in the book, though not in situations as dramatic, Harper Lee and her characters helped me once again put my own life and times in perspective.    An American classic?  It's more than that--it's a human classic.  We are not likely to see another like this in our lifetime.    If you've read it before, it's most likely time to read it again...you will appreciate it even more and admire Harper Lee's ability to communicate matters of the heart even more....like fine wine, it gets better and better...
B000B0WODA|4.0|While not as fond of this release as their first, it's still a frequently played catchy sound.  Their energy is refreshing and doesn't feel contrived.  All-in-all I like it.
038572179X|3.0|There was little need for this to be taken to a novel's length. A short story version would have held my interest; the novel left me longing for the (somewhat obvious) end to arrive. In fact, I skipped over many long, contemplative sections, just hoping to get to more of the plot. The writing is lovely, but this book is not worth the precious reading time it requires.

0345452585|1.0|This was perhaps the absolute worse Jonathan Kellerman going!<br />I have read at least two-thirds of his novels most of which are quite pleasing and entertaining, some more wierd than others...<br />Not good at all! Really!<br />At any rate, I agree completely ( as does my  wife), who feels as did a recent reviewer; it would be incredibly fantastic to find that this novel was not something from his distant past, that was now thrown in for a quick hit....<br />It was formal, unlike any other of his novels, truly BORING X 10, and we barely got through it on a relaxing summer vacation.<br />Both of us felt it was just terrible at best! Rent it on audio book at the library, that way you can stand the horribly slow plot culminating in a relatively exciting (much needed) ending....
B000003TBP|5.0|Odelay rules.  Beck cracks me up with his ability to make fun of proper genres, all the while producing flawless examples of that sound.  he's an artist on many levels, never better crafted than on this release.
184121602X|5.0|We were first introduce to this story via the Playhouse Disney webpage.  My son was ever so fascinated by the interactive storybook at the website that we ended up buying this book.  Although the book is slightly different, it still is true to the idea that it's silly to not try foods you think you may not like.  My son, age 25 months, LOVES to eat peas, carrots, fish sticks and cherry tomatos (a.k.a. green drops from greenland, orange twiglets from jupiter, ocean nibbles from under the sea, and moon squirters)!  In fact he can't get enough of these healthy items!  It has also made him more open to trying various foods.  Perhaps it's just his age... but, having Charlie and Lola around sure helped!  Worth a try with any fussy eater... or child who has a great imagination and sense of humor.
B000001FTQ|5.0|This is the best version of \\"Bad\\" that you will find, short of the Live Aid performance.  Canned audience or not, it's fantastic.
B000EJ9VUW|5.0|In a musical climate increasingly geared toward the mp3/single song format, Drum's Not Dead is an Album with a capitol A. It is a sprawling masterwork that demands total immersion, sincere consideration, and yes, some initial patience. Much like a Rothko painting, this record is about textures and subtleties, revealing a bit more of itself with every listen. Liars are minimalists who, with few tools, have achieved something both spacious and infinitely dimensional. After many listens, Drum's Not Dead eludes familiarity. It is always something new, adventurous and unashamed. Return to it now and then, and it will certainly hook you.
B00082IJ08|4.0|This is an excellent CD to just pop in and go about your business.  It comes in and out of focus with whatever you're doing, yet the tune is always appropriate to the task at hand.  Great music for dancing and driving.
B000MV8AE0|5.0|Ed Harris creates a convincing Beethoven. ( Immortal Beloved committed  crass nonsense  identifying Beethoven's widowed sister-in-law as his beloved.. No historian of standing would try that.)  Composers had copyists. The female copyist in Copying Beethoven is gentle and delightful fictionalizing.  At the real premier of the 9th Symphony Beethoven had an assistant conductor who turned him around to see the ovation at the end.  That passage was done perfectly in this film, it was deeply moving.  Diane Kreuger  does the alchemy of hero-worshiping empathy and self-asserting spunk beautifully. There she speaks for all of us  who love the difficult man as well as his music.  In May I visited Beethove's apartments in Vienna, the Pasqualatie house, and in Heilingenstadt.     In several leading biographies, including Thayer and Maynard Solomon,  I have never read that Beethoven smashed a young engineer's bridge model.  His roughness could have been shown by his berating the engineer loudly, disturbing the meeting, and raising his cane threatening to smash the model, but not going that far. If he was trying to teach the engineer a lesson in self-criticism, that would have been enough. Any notion that Beethoven was jealously  striking at Anna Holst's friend is ludicrous.       Those moments in the film when Beethoven explains his music to Anna Holst allude to how Beethoven 's genius  and soul conquer deafness to attain a higher level of consciousness and then communicate this to us through his music.  One can hear him doing this in his pure, not program,  music  where he is out among the galaxies dealing with things that do not connect to earthly concerns, or talking and thinking fractally with God.     The film's score was powerful, the performances first rate.  Costumes, scenery, stying right on the mark. The film approaches Amadeus in quality.  I sent a copy to my composer son.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I love this CD.  It is rare that I find one that I like every track on it, but this one is great.  The lyrics are smart, the music is catchy and complex without being pretentious.  Mostly, it's fun.
0743289684|4.0|I bought the book after I read some of the review, and I actually genuinely wants to learn more about Islam. Not that I am going to convert, but I want to understand it a bit more.  She grew up Muslim, and now she is Athesis.  There is, always some bones you can pick on anyone's memory, or the actual account of the details. However, I do think she gave an account for the muslim women who want to be free and question the authority. She had mentioned that is her personal experience and feeling. So, there is no need to question anyone's personal account of details, being that we all look within ourself for answer.     The book is a bit slow, and confusing for the first chapter or two.  It was difficult read in the beginning. Once you get through the first few chapters, the author actually grab your attention, that I can not put the book down until I am done reading it.      Whatever she had suffered, and all the Muslim girls and women had suffered should be addressed, however, it is also not right for us to impose our believe and way of life onto the people who do  not want it.  There will always be people who disagree, the violence should be eliminated.  It is easier said than done, if we can not even stop domestic violence, which is clear wrong and against the law, how do we have the moral clearance to point fingers on others?
B000002UJQ|4.0|I really get off on their smooth, mellow sound, and the poetic lyrics.  Radiohead is gifted at establishing their social perspective without being in your face about it.  Not that they are hiding anything...
0812975219|5.0|Wow! a quant who is an entertaining writer. You may howl with laughter at one point, turn the page and then come face to face with your own sobering human foibles reading this book. You may never trust a broker/traders track record every again. Taleb just makes so much sense in light of his life experience. Most of us end up confusing pur luck for skill. Many of us have had to work for his \\"empty suits\\" (CEO/leaders who look good, are tall and can really use power point, yet they bring so little to the table). What if all the major \\"leaders\\" in our world are only recognized as successful because they have been in the right place at the right time? There are as many or more who are their equals or betters who made different choices. What if present day institutions are no wiser than those we ridicule from the 18th century? What proof do we have not to remain classical skeptics? As someone who loved probability and stats all my life this writer is a kindred spirit. I chuckled through his rationale as to why he does not read the paper nor use the media for news. The news reports the noise so that we miss the significant event. In recent months I have really worked to rise above the noise, and it has made quite a difference in my point of view. This is a must buy book.
B0002858YS|5.0|I love this CD.  I listen to it constantly.  Another of those rare few on which every song is a winner.  I just can't listen to it enough.
1594489505|5.0|I'm always fascinated with books set in countries I lived in as a child. John Dalton's \\"Heaven Lake\\" captured China with truth and grace. Roberts' \\"Shantaram\\" nailed the feel of India. I had to read Hosseini and see what he was able to come up with. I was there in Afghanistan, back in the seventies (the time of this novel's beginning), and now I wondered what fictional possibilities there were to explore.<br /><br />I shouldn't have worried. \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is a breathtaking book. Beautiful and evocative, it's wholly economic in its writing style. It also takes our breath away, punching us in the gut, wringing the emotion from us. Often full of hardship, it follows the demure, yet bold, lives of two women: Laila and Mariam. These two are prisoners of fate, torn from family and love, but never fully giving in to the horrors around them. The story belongs to them, showcasing sacrifice and courage, irony and hope.<br /><br />Hosseini draws us into a world that seems alien and unrecognizable, then makes it human and warm. The warmth is short-lived, seen only in glimpses between the hardships of this war-torn country. Caught in the crossfire of ideologies and war, Laila and Mariam make choices--and suffer choices--that lead to a bittersweet conclusion. In every way, this is an instant classic, a story that takes us outside ourselves and broadens our view of the world while also focusing us in on the very personal stories at stake.
B000GY729M|5.0|I have to admit I was incredibly hesitant when purchasing this album. I had heard the singles from Hot Fuss and I was unimpressed. They were just another generic piece of whatever music happened to be selling at the time. Poppy, catchy, fun, but completely lacking any kind of depth that would make them worth listening to more than once. Then I was thrown a 180. I heard the first single, When You Were Young, and something about it grabbed me. Clearly the same band, but something about that song was sounding different then everything else I had heard by them. Then I heard another song off the album, I can't remember which, and I was surprised to find that I was really digging it. It wasn't long before I decided I might actually have to buy this album, and this would be no routine purchase, contemporary music is not my thing. The most recently released album I had purchased before this was Weezer's Green album, based entirely off the strength of the music they had released in the 90s, and it was a huge let down for me.<br /><br />I started with the first three tracks, and they were good. I was surprised by how good they were, but I really wasn't liking the beginning of that 4th track, and I put the album away for a while. After a few weeks I put the album on again, for another go, and this time I actually listened to the whole thing. I was amazed. The fourth track isn't all that satisfying when it starts out, but it quickly develops into a very enjoyable song. I was surprised to find most of the songs had a very nice build up in a similar fashion. When I was finished I was convinced I had heard one of the best albums released in a very very long time. I jumped online to see what kinds of praise this album had received. Were the Killers everyone's new favorite band?<br /><br />No, not at all. Not even close. I was taken off guard when I discovered that the album was not well received at all, not even by their own fans, despite the huge growth in between the former album and the current. Everything about the album showed drastic improvement and maturity. These weren't songs written with the intention of getting two or three good singles, and there was no filler here. This was a real, cohesive album, like bands used to make in the glory days of music.<br /><br />It's not hard to see why this album was dismissed so quickly by the general public. It's the same thing that happened with the Pet Sounds album by the Beach Boys back in the 60s. The music had grown far too complex for the pop loving fan base they had begun with, and anyone that actually would have enjoyed the brilliance in the music would never believe the group was capable of creating it. I have a feeling Sam's Town is destined to the same fate. It will disappear into obscurity, with only a small group of loving fans to keep the memory alive.t.

Picoult's style is outstanding and the fictional content grabs you to the point where you sometimes forget it's fiction. Outstanding and thought provoking.
0316067598|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a SEAL friend.  It kept me on the edge on my seat from beginning to end!  I experienced so many emotions throughout the entire book! I also listened to the audio version as well, that was also pretty intense!  I've always had a respect for our troops especially for our Special forces, but my respect for them is even more so since reading this book!  I can't thank them enough for their selfless sacrifice.  They are absolutely AMAZING!!!  We owe them sooo much!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This Grandma and Grandpa has watched this over and over with the Grandkids, and it does'nt just have to be during Christmas Time.
B000QUUD60|2.0|The Bonus Features on this edition has a bad picture quality.  They use copys of the third generation!! That´s not a good job!  Of course the movies are great, but the original film is in MONO  and the BONUS is a joke for the year of 2007! Greetings from Germany
B00004WEJZ|1.0|I remember being a very big 007 fan at the time I saw this. I was actually quite young when I saw this and I had a copy of it on tape. I must say I liked it, but that was because I was 9. I just went back and recently watched this movie again, and now I see the reason of the criticism (sp?) for this movie. It really is that bad. Here is my reason for hating this movie:<br /><br />1. The action scenes were a joke. Camera shots too long, looks like they were edited together in 5 minutes, and lame vehicle choice for the chase scenes. The music was a joke too, instead of music to fit the mood we get Elevator jazz music! WTF!<br /><br />2. This is basically a Thunderball remake, and a pretty pointless one too. There are very big changes (the burst button being on the dashboard of the bike instead of the handle WTF?), and no reason for them.<br /><br />3. This was NOT the 007 I knew! This was not the smooth-talkin', flirty Bond that we got in the old and new movies! He wasn't the smart Bond who would do things his own way in Life-or-Death situations, he'd just do the old cliched escapes.<br /><br />4. The dialogue is cringe-inducingly bad! Example:<br /><br />Fatima: You're still wet!<br />007: Yes, but my Martini's still dry.<br /><br />5. The music! HORRIBLE! We'd get that cliche'd DA DA DAAAAAAA music in suspenseful scenes, and some elevator jazz music in action scenes.<br /><br />6. The acting was unintentionally hilarious. Kim Basinger's wooden performance had me laughing at times, and Sean Connery stinks the role BIG TIME. Rowan Atkinson sucks too, he is a funny actor, but there's one place he dosen't belong: In a 007 movie.<br /><br />7. The sets look bad, the NSNA looks like it's been around for 100 years, and the whole movie looks like it was made on a budget of $20. But that's completely understandable, much of the film's budget was spent on getting Sean Connery back.<br /><br />That's me done. I can't understand why I liked this film, it sucked. Please avoid this.

0792844890|1.0|A friend of mine was raving about this movie, so I finally decided to check it out.  I could not even watch the whole thing, I got so bored and fed up with the cornball attempts at humor.  (\\"We're gonna jam their radar!\\" and the spaceship shoots raspberry jam at the radar dish.  Give me a break.  Or how about all the dumb jewish jokes (the \\"Druish Princess\\") and weak plays on words - \\"May the Schwartz be with you\\"? Character names like \\"Pizza the Hut\\"?  Mel Brooks has always had a weakness for obvious plays on words, but rarely are they as flat as this.)<br /><br />Equally hackneyed are the \\"jokes\\" that rely on breaking the fourth wall (i.e. the actors acknowledging the audience) - there are several scenes where the characters make a big to-do about being in the middle of a movie called \\"Spaceballs\\" and it's all just pointless and obvious.  I tried really hard to get into the \\"zaniness\\" of the Star Wars spoof, but it was just ... not funny.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that it tries way too hard to be funny and it is way too self-aware.  The best parodies are the ones that are completely serious in delivering utterly absurd scenarios.  But this movie felt like Mel Brooks was almost reminding the audience over and over that something funny was going on.  If you have to be reminded to laugh, it ain't that funny.

B000OLGCHA|5.0|I bought the soundtrack to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and loved it. I had passed on the other works because I thought there would be too much repitition. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised when I heard this soundtrack because it is so different. \\"Fireworks\\" is a great opener from the CD and I could listen to \\"Flight of the Order\\" over and over. I loved the fact that some of the music on this CD is light and energetic when the story has taken a decidedly dark turn - nice contrast. This is especially evident in the score selected for Professor Umbridge. No, it's not John Williams, but enjoyable all the same.

0812975219|5.0|Bottom Line: This is an interesting book that gives the reader a new perspective on life and the world we live in.    What You Will Learn: One of the first thing Taleb makes clear is that all those Wall Street brokers earning million dollar bonuses are not as smart as we think they are! Most of them are riding a wave that will crest and destroy them eventually.  He also uses many examples to show that \\"experts\\" in all fields are often wrong because we under estimate the importance of rare but siginficant difficult to predict events.    Parting Shot: If you are in the mood for something unusual that will make you think, this is the book for you!
B000OVLBEO|5.0|This is a great movie.  It is well directed and the graphics and sfx are convincing.  As far as sticking to the comics, it is cleverly inconsistant.  Unlike the Spider-Man and Fantastic Four movies, which try to depict an origin believable to new fans and familiar to old fans, the Ghost Rider movie is a retelling of the main theme and feel of the story, rather than the story itself.  Instead of an adult Johnny Blaze who summons the devil through a ritual, he is a troubled kid who unwittingly sells his soul to a stranger.  Though it is not the original origin of the rider, it could be debated that it is a better beginning to introduce the innocence and strength of Johnny's spirit.  In addition, the movie skips all of Johnny's trials trying to discover his powers and dives straight into the shared-body experience of his more recent comic books.  Finally, the appearance of Carter Slade, who is the original Ghost Rider, before Marvel, adds a respectfull tone to the true origins of the \\"Spirit of Vengeance.\\"
B000ASDFJU|5.0|So I bought this set for my girlfriend. At the time the price on Amazon was a little less (about $10) than the stores around Boston. The outside is fuzzy (like suede), and the design is very clever. The show itself I started watching with my girlfriend. I think it is a very funny show.<br />At one point, I had been outted by my loving girlfriend that I had been watching the show ... Sometimes without her. After getting teased for a good while one other guy let a Sex in the City quote slip (He had been watching the show too it seemed.) Then all the rest of the guys confessed that they watch the show too. It was beginning to feel like a support meeting.<br />My point is, even though you will not find \\"the guys\\" getting together for a Sex in the City marathon and a gallon of ice cream - the show is entertaining to guys too. My advice guys - make up an excuse (buying it for my sister, girlfriend, or it's for a project at work.) and hide the pink folder thing in the drawer, watch the show, but not in a bubble bath.
0345298349|5.0|After reading HAVANA BAY, I went upstream to GORKY PARK.  Both novels are so very good, even though the thriller/mystery component is not that compelling; it doesn't have to be.  Gorky Park is smart and cerebral, like Arkady Renko.  Every page is rich with great characters, great dialogue, good writing style and pace. It's about life, police work, corruption, greed, political influence and survival in the former USSR and reminds me of the great James Ellroy novels.  Martin Cruz Smith also compares with John Le Carr&eacute;.  Five star plus for Gorky Park and on to Polar Star.
0553582461|3.0|I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't been said before. I've been crying off and on since I finished this book over 24 hours ago. I have yet to eat and my friends keep wanting to know what's wrong.     This book broke my heart.     The Author herself in a forum stated that the ending kind of took a life of it's own. That her projected ending (when she started writing) changed by the time she actually got around to writing this. This happens to writers and I can't fault her that. It's her creation and her baby.     However, the ending is so tragic to me that I can find little solace in it. I am undable to follow her train of thought to what she deems to be the \\"natural ending\\". I follow the trail originally set out by her and arrive at my own conclusions.     The ending with SPOILERS    Molly is, IMO an cop out. We are told over and over again that she is his 'lost love'. And also we know that she could never accept him with the Wit, could never accept him with Nighteyes - that he would have to choose. The Fool believes she would do the same with his love/bond with Fitz. So how is this true love? The Fool's love for Fitz \\"knows no boundaries\\". It's unconditional. It is the purest love, the most monumental love, the kind of love that transcends physical and mental bounds -- that has been committed to page in the fantasy genre -- IMO. And yet it is pushed aside at the end for Molly. I never expected a happy compact ending. But for Fitz to say, \\"Molly is enough, more than enough for me.\\"  makes me want to break something.    Perhaps the Catalyst and the Changer could not stay together indefinitely without changing the world over and over again -- but why did we have to have the ending we did?     I feel awful for the Fool at the end of this. He has his life and the knowledge that Fitz would have followed him and the knowledge that he was loved, oh so loved by him.... but I'm not sure that's enough considering he may think Fitz dead.     I'm rambling. The point is I don't know if I recommend to read this book. If you're going to take it the way I have, you may have to see a shrink.     I'm going to go back to crying now.
1400063515|5.0|Nissim Taleb is an options trader/statistician turned philosopher and so his THE BLACK SWAN: THE IMPACT OF THE HIGHLY IMPROBABLE doesn't fit neatly into any one category, but will equally interest libraries with patrons concerned with business, philosophy, science, and more. A Black Swan here serves as a metaphor for an unpredictable event with massive impact - and they underlie almost everything about our world. They can occur in personal lives as well as affect societies as a whole. The blend of philosophy and social analysis makes THE BLACK SWAN a wide-ranging discussion suitable both for college-level and general-interest library lending collections.<br /><br />Diane C.

It was so up-to-date at the end that the reader could relate to the world perspective of the characters. It was enlightening to read about the females in this society, especially since I am female.    Highly recommend!

0316113077|5.0|When a famous shoe designer received a surprise birthday cake of a stiletto perched next to a tissue-filled shoe box, he was amazed at the talents of Elisa Strauss of Confetti Cakes in New York - and everyone wanted one of her creations. THE CONFETTI CAKES COOKBOOK would at first glance seem to appeal only to seasoned bakers, but in fact offers up eye-catching projects for every skill level, from novice to expert. Chapters pack in projects and decorations and not just full, large cakes but cookies, cupcakes, and smaller cake choices. Any tired of the 'same old' approach who seeks something different and eye-catching will find THE CONFETTI CAKES COOKBOOK attractive - as will public lending libraries catering to dessert cooks.<br /><br />Diane C.

At first he wasn't too thrilled about reading it based on the description on the back but once in the book he can't put it down.  He has pretty much finished reading the 1st book & will read the next two for fun.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I already owned THE FINAL CUT on CD... the original version of it, that is. I was all set to purchase the PINK FLOYD compilation CD that included the formerly impossible-to-find track \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\"... when I happened to glance at a copy of THE FINAL CUT in a Barnes & Noble store -- and there it was! Tucked in-between tracks 3 and 4 of the original FINAL CUT album, a song known originally to have been a part of the film version of THE WALL.    PINK FLOYD fans, back when this album first came out, didn't seem to like it that much. I felt like a voice crying in the wilderness then, seeming to be the only one who thought it a masterpiece on par with THE WALL. Hell, in the film of THE WALL there's that scene where Bob Geldof sings a snippet from \\"Your Possible Pasts\\", making THE FINAL CUT a sort of sequel to THE WALL (and Roger Waters' \\"PROS AND CONS OF HITCH-HIKING\\" a pseudo-sequel to THE FINAL CUT, since Geldof also sings a snippet from the last song on that album).    Ignore what all the negative reviewers might've said about these post-WALL albums spearheaded by Waters. He's a genius, and his lyrics have more poetry in them than almost every other songwriter out there combined.     This CD was worth getting, even though I already had the \\"old\\" version of it... just so I could finally get \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" on CD. At last! And it fits in rather well, though it hadn't originally been intended as part of this album. I almost think it might've been better to begin this \\"new\\" version of THE FINAL CUT with \\"Tigers\\" and then seque into \\"The Post War Dream\\"... but it works well this way, too.
B000002JPA|5.0|Images & Words what an album to review, I been thinking a lot to do it but never knew how to, which will be the right aproach, how could I start or what could I say about the finest album in prog history, yes you can mention The wall, The dark side of the moon, Presto, Operation Mindcrime, you name it, but at last Images & Words is the best album in prog music and obviously in music history (sorry if I heart some feelings, but its my own opinion)    It was 1992 when I heard Images & Words for the first time, a very good friend of mine told me to listen to Dream Theater's Images and Words, I really do not like prog music or maybe I just did not understand it... he told me I would love the vocals on this band, so I listen Pull me Under and dig the song but then Another Day started to sound, man everything changed.. actually my musical style made a 360° turn, I could not believe the incredible, amazing sound I was listening, simply breathtaking... at that time I was more into Motley Crue, Skid Row, Metallica, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Tesla, Firehouse, Mr. Big and all those kind of music, so I was really far away of prog music but that afternoon when I listen to I&W everything changed, not that I do not listen to those kind of bands anymore, I grew listening to them so I still listen to them but Progressive Rock got an important part in my life, so important that Dream Theater is my favorite band and Prog rock my favorite music... now I know I own a lot to that friend who introduced me to Dream Theater's music, he showed me the best band in the world and he showed me how music should be played and made... thanx dude¡¡¡    Well back to Images and Words, let me tell you it is DT's easiest album to listen to but at any moment the least complex album, I&W is so incredible that you can listen and comprehend it very well but at the same time you will be amazed of how intense, technical, complex and structure everysong is.. I was not used to all the shifiting moments a song could have or the length of the songs, but that was exactly what captures me I actually loved those things, Metropolis is one of my all time favorites due to all the changes it has, it can goes from technical to slow moments or viceversa without losing the structure of the song, they simply speed up the song then slow it down at any second and made it so brilliantly, that's what I love form prog rock, and Dream shows me that path    I really believe Images and Words is one of a kind album, in my opinion its the best album ever released by Dream Theater (or any band) and man that's saying something if we consider they have released masterpieces as Scenes from a Memory, Awake, Octavarium or Systematic Chaos lately, but at this moment 15 years from its release Images and Words sounds so actual, so incredible, time has not passed through this album.     I&W is James Labrie's introduction and for me from that very moment Dream Theater really became the true masters of Progressive rock, James gave the one thing they needed, James's voice is the perfect match for Dream Theater music, and with every album they seem to fit better and better; Images and Words contains Pull me Under one of the most known songs by DT but it also contains, in my opinion, 3 of the most incredible songs DT has ever composed Another Day, Surrounded and Metropolis Pt.1 (this song became an entire album on Scenes from a Memory, if you have not listen to it, man you are losing one of the finest albums ever released), this 3 songs are in my opinion simply perfection, and a true example of what Kevin Moore (former DT keyboardist) offered to the band it was a real shame he decided to part ways with Dream Theater, now Jordan has replaced him amazingly and really seems it has been in the band forever¡¡    Images and Words is a fantastic album, perfectly blended and a testament of what progressive rock should really be; It is a real pleasure to listen to it and now 15 years away from its releasethe amazing thing is that you can still discover new things on every song as if it has been released a few months ago    If yoy have not listen to Images and Words believe me you should do it... this album is a must for any progressive rock fan.    Man I tried to put into these lines what Images and Words is or what it means to me, but its not really easy, this album simply change my life and the way I appreciate music today and that cannot be expressed well enough, thanks to Dream Theater's Images and Words I discover prog music and obviously great prog bands

B000003JA9|5.0|It's so hard to chose the best Jethro Tull album because there are so many exceptional works from this changing line up of wonderful musicians. I have to put Aqualung near the top though, every song stands on its own as a sure fire winner. Somewhat of a concept album which definately became a trend \\"back in the day\\". This is the album that put Jethro Tull on the map and they enjoyed huge success for years to come. I would also recommend Thick As A Brick if you are new to this terrific band. - Ciao
B000QUCNP4|4.0|Mick,    I sincerely hope you've seen this movie. I'm not real crazy about watching a movie with a former gay cowboy, and a drugs and drink'n guy playing a drugs and drink'n guy; BUT (notice the big but), despite not wanting to like this movie I thought it was awesome. Excellent casting, screenplay, pacing, etc. This movie was actually made to be entertaining, not have you feel for the guy do'n the stabb'n and kill'n and stuff. Plus the scene with the squirrels and the phallus that was covered in some sort of putrid material made you want to crap your pants from disgust or hysteria.    I love serial killer stuff because, to me, it's almost like Sci - Fi. It takes you to another place because it's so foreign to my mindset. As you said in \\"Voliminal\\", if these serial killer types would take time for a good nutt every once in a while, maybe the body count would be lower.    Mick, please let me know of any other serial killer type movies that are actually well done. I loved the guy that was Leigh, he deserves an Oscar for his performance. Plus he looked so much like the guy that was Drew Carey's brother on his self titled show it was incredible. It's like Mimi had FINALLY driven a guy over the edge!!!    Well I'll let you go for now. I'm really looking forward to the next album!!!     Sincerely,         p.s. From the you-tube \\"how to play like an a--hole\\" bit, maybe you should consider doing some stand-up comedy. I guaronteeeee that the media title of \\"heavy metal guitarist makes debut as hysterical funnyman\\" would get you noticed so you could point out a few more things the world at large needs to take into consideration.
B000002J2B|4.0|Turbulent weather ahead for the boys of Genesis? That's what wuthering means and I guess it might have been a harbinger of what lay ahead of this British group. They had lost a very creative writer and vocalist in Peter Gabriel and this would be the last album for bandmate Steve Hackett. Their previous album \\"Trick of the Tail\\" showed they could weather the storm quite nicely, thank you. This album is definately one of the high points for this band if not their best effort. I happen to like every song on this disc and I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for good music from Genesis. It has been stated that the band chooses songs from this album and Trick of the Tail when in concert and for good reason. These two albums represent some of the finest work from Genesis and anyone who likes Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, Yes, King Crimson, Kansas, Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, Spock's Beard, Porcupine Tree and other prog rock bands should warm up to Wind & Wuthering very quickly. Don't let the name or the cover of the album fool you, this may be the best thing Genesis ever did! - Ciao
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Even though I was a metalhead in the 80's I fully embraced  the grunge revolution in the 90's. I knew Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and the Pumpkins would   stand the test of time while the grunge scene would soon fade away. After hitting their plateau with two back to back  masterpiece albums, \\"Siamese Dream\\" and \\"Mellon Collie\\" the Pumpkins self destructed and while I liked \\"Adore\\" and  \\"Machina\\" it was never the same again and for a decade they  were on the backburner and all but forgoten until I heard  about Billy resurrecting the band(him and Jimmy) and the   release of Zeitgeist.   Bringing back the old sound I was overwhelmed with nostalgia upon hearing the first track but the first few  listens didn't do alot for me. After seeing them live in  Santa Cruz and hearing it a few more times I was hooked and  can't stop listening to it. Not perfect by any means but it  should grow on any Pumpkins fan eventually. And anyone who  makes a big deal about Iha and D'arcy not being part of the  reunion is simply ignorant. Yes, they were a major part of   the old Pumpkins identity and character but they were \\"glorified session players\\". You never heard them on  the old albums as Billy did all the guitar and bass tracks.  The core of Smashing Pumpkins is Billy and Jimmy. End of story.
B00005JPMZ|5.0|I am very pleasently surprised I took the chance and bought this movie.  After the first three movies, I thought the movies had run their course.  With the aide of Computer Graphics, the turtles had new life put into them in a way live action can't.       This story flows just like a comic book, starting with Leo on a training mission in central america, and a new story being started about a general who wished to take over the world 3000 years ago, and gained the power of immortality.  However, he unleashed onto the world something he did not excpect.   The turtles left in new york (Don, Mike, and Raf) are in dissaray.  Splinter is frustrated, Casey and April are worried.   Buy this movie, see how this unfolds, and await the sequal, which is inevitable.  Relatively kid friendly, a light PG film.  Much better than some other \\"kids\\" films.  Both widescreen and Full screen are on this one disc, excellent value.

Home again, she struggles to find herself, returning to school, falling in love, exploring ideas with new friends, and discovering more about her family's history, all the while trying to avoid The Guardians of the Revolution.<br /><br />Persepolis 2 is just as enjoyable as the first, and I look forward to reading more of Satrapi's work.
B000244EMO|5.0|Alan \\"Dutch\\" Schaefer(Arnold Schwarzenegger)is a major in the United States Army,with a successful and respected career behind him. So,this makes Alan Schaefer's assignment to fly to a Central American country to rescue hostages held by guerilla fighters simple,right?<br /><br />Wrong!!! Shortly after Alan Schaefer and his friend/colleague Major George Dillon(Carl Weathers)have arrived to their destination with a small army(Bill Duke's character of Mac,Jesse Ventura's character of Blain,Sonny Landham's character of Billy,Richard Chaves' character of Poncho,and Shane Black's character of Hawkins),things turn out to be difficult and untruthful. They only get worse when Alan Schaefer,George Dillon,and their army encounter something much more worse than they expected.<br /><br />What is that something? An alien predator(\\"portrayed\\" by the late actor Kevin Peter Hall--RIP)is present,and his ready to demolish Alan Schaefer,George Dillon,and their team of men. Alan Schaefer,George Dillon,and their army may have experience. But,the alien predator they are up against is much more of an enemy that they were ever prepared for. Stopping him and saving themselves isn't going to be an easy.<br /><br />\\"Predator\\" may be an action film,but there is not a thing keeping it from being perfect. The plot may be far-fetched,but the script has an edge of darkness that saves it from that. \\"Predator\\" delivers richly executed suspense from top to bottom,with a beauty that few other films have. That beauty? That beauty is that while watching \\"Predator\\",you really do not know who will win--the good side,or the bad side. The action is entertaining and goes along well with the plot,while it succeeds in not being violent just for the sake of violence. All of that,alongside good chemistry between the characters in \\"Predator\\" brought to life by good acting,as well as astounding special and visual effects,allow \\"Predator\\" to fully come together,and be the good film that it is.<br /><br />If you likeaction films and have time to watch a film,give \\"Predator\\" a try. It is one of the most well-constructed action films ever made,and you can't go wrong with the special feautures on this DVD,either.
B000GLKLCK|5.0|I've listened to Mozart's piano concertos in one form or another for several years and I've never heard them played as magnificently as Perahia does here. The English Chamber Orchestra sounds lush and full, but it's Perahia's lucid, mellifluous tone that will make you happy you shelled out the money for this set. And by the way, the early and middle Concertos are wonderful and have many many moments of pure vintage Mozart beauty; don't get stuck only listening to the well known ones (21, 23, 25 etc...)  In addition to the joy you'll get in listening to these concertos (surely some of Mozart's finest creations), these also function as a fine introduction to the style and sound of Mozart's greatest music: his operas. In many of these concertos, Mozart uses the interplay between the piano and the orchestra in similar fashion to how he would later use voice and orchestra in his operas. Before listening to these concertos I had very little interest in opera. I've since become quite fan and I love Mozart's three Da Ponte operas (Le Nozze Di Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Cosi Fan Tutte) as well as Die Zauberflote.

B000021Y77|1.0|This film has some cult following. And I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Basically, this is just a \\"one-idea-film\\" that would have made a GREAT short feature. Instead, they stretched it into a feature film.<br /><br />And it is all offensively idiotic.<br /><br />1 - Lola is at home. Her boyfriend calls her and explains his problem: he forgot some gangster's money on the subway... and some homeless guy found it.<br /><br />This gives birth to one of the most uninspired explanation scenes in movie History. Who's the bad guy, what was the money for, what will happen if he does not get it back, etc... one stupid phone call that lasts forever with Lola and her dumb boyfriend talking... and talking... and talking...<br /><br />Halfway through their ridiculous conversation, I'm already thinking: \\"this guy is sooo stupid and incompetent that I DO WANT him to get killed! I hope Lola gives him the boot!\\"<br /><br />But she doesn't. Instead, when he says something idiot like \\"help me or I'll just rob the supermarket close to this phone booth\\" (to which I'd simply reply \\"do it, you stupid punk. Then drop dead!\\") she just says \\"I'll be there in twenty minutes and I'll think of something. Don't do anything stupid!\\" - like if that wasn't the rule so far... LOL<br /><br />Then I started thinking: \\"Wow, I can't wait to find out what will she do in order to get the money. I hope she'll do something brilliant\\".<br /><br />And what does she do? She runs aaaaallllll the way from home to the bank where her dad works. Exactly: the \\"running\\" you see on the title is to daddy!!!<br /><br />Hello!! Can't we be brilliant and creative?<br />No.<br /><br />Daddy (by far the most fascinating character in this film) gives her the boot (hurray!). And she does not get the money. When she meets her stupid boyfriend, the moron is already robbing the supermarket. She helps him and (guess what?!?!?) she gets killed by the police on the way out.<br /><br />What follows next is (we go back in time) a long and boring bed scene (put there to make some time - so this can be a feature film) where the two lovers are talking... and talking... and talking... for almost 8 minutes things like \\"do you love me?\\" \\"Yes\\" \\"How much?\\" \\"A lot\\" \\"Are you sure?\\" \\"I guess so\\" \\"So you are not sure?\\" \\"I am\\" \\"what would you do if I'd die?\\" \\"I don't know\\"... -things like that.<br /><br />...No wonder why teenagers love this. This is bad teenager screenwriting.<br /><br />And then we see two variations of the same story:<br /><br />B) Lola goes to dad and ends up robbing the bank. She gets the money, but this time it is her boyfriend who gets killed (hit by an ambulance).<br /><br />C)Lola goes to the bank but takes a while longer to get there. Does not find dad and goes to a casino (A CASINO!!!!) that just happens to be there where she gambles some change money and wins all the money she needs... -talk about deus-ex-machina.<br /><br />Is this supposed to be a masterpiece?<br />Would someone please explain to me, like if I were a four-year-old child, why is this film so praised.<br /><br />I do not get it.here the two lovers are talking... and talking... and talking... for almost 8 minutes things like \\"do you love me?\\" \\"Yes\\" \\"How much?\\" \\"A lot\\" \\"Are you sure?\\" \\"I guess so\\" \\"So you are not sure?\\" \\"I am\\" \\"what would you do if I'd die?\\" \\"I don't know\\"... -things like that.    ...No wonder why teenagers love this.

B000MNP2KI|3.0|I love Daniel Craig.  But this movie bounced around too much.  Too much concentration on car racing and explosion special effects.  Not enough cool gadgets that are signature of a Bond movie.  Coolest part is when he's poisoned and has to \\"jumpstart\\" his heart with his car.
B00005JPQL|4.0|I thought this was going to be another Narnia, but to my surprise it was much better. The acting is top notch for this kind of film. Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer and Sienna Miller were all great, not to mention pleasing to the eyes. Robert De Niro was the real surprise here. He actually showed a wide range of acting, unlike most of his recent films. Too bad his role was a tad on the short side. The CGI was good and the music had the epic feel you would expect. All in all, worth your time and money if you like fantasy films with a little romance, humor and action thrown in for good measure.
B0007Y08T2|4.0|this is a total big ban purchase .... although is real difficult to see it in my country, I like the skidancer album more than this.....
0375831002|5.0|Probably one of the best books I have ever read, this book still haunts my thoughts months after reading it.  Beautifully written and immediately accessible, Zusak tells the stories of Lisel Memminger, a young girl living under the thumb of Nazi Germany, and the people who inhabit her impoverished neighborhood, as seen through the eyes of Death, himself a character in the novel.<br /><br />This deeply moving novel is being marketed as young adult fiction, but don't let that keep you from reading it, as it is as mature a handling of the subject matter as any could be.  My book club read it, and all but one of us proclaimed it the best book we'd read this year.<br /><br />In some ways, it reminded me of \\"Water For Elephants\\" in that the language was very descriptive and the narrative exciting.  I couldn't wait to get to read this book each day, and I missed the characters when I'd finished it.<br /><br />I read this book earlier in the year, and though I have wanted to review it, share it with everyone because it is so good, I have waited to write this.  In many ways it's hard to put into words just how great this book is.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|happy to hear the kid friendly version is being made!  heard the original and its not ok for the 8 y/o crowd. does get repetitive after awhile.
0345440900|5.0|I have a 3 month old baby boy and I would highly recommed this book.  In fact, I wish I had read this book earlier because it would have saved me a lot of stress.  Tracey's insight is really helpful and I feel that I've connected with my baby much better since reading this book.  She also provides a lot of support to women who choose not to breastfeed.  I was feeling guilty for not breastfeeding especially since my son had formula issues but Tracey help to put things into perspective about it being a very personal choice and there being nothing wrong with choosing formula feeding.
B000OVLBF8|1.0|Throughout this whole movie I couldn't decide what I hated most.  Was it Nick Cage's bizarre hair?  Was it the forced and awkward dialoge?  Was it the super heavy reliance on special effects?  Was it the complete lack of chemistry between Cage and what's her name?  OK, I admit, some of the special FX were cool, but that does not make a good movie.  I just hated this movie.  Have pity for me, because I saw this train wreck in the theater.  Sucks to be me.
B00003CXMG|5.0|There aren't many movies that truly sell the characters. To be quiet honest most characters in movies are either one dimensional or a characature of real people. I love it that the lead guitar player of StillWater is egocentric and self-centered yet is still a pretty good guy. All the characters on this movie have that real, flawed, and multidimensional quality.   The story is also original and doesn't try to be anything more than what it is. The plot is solid but still loose enough for the characters to drive the movie. Really brings the 70's alive without parodying it. Great movie, great soundtrack.   This movie is the antidote to the big budget summer blockbuster crap that has choked the movie industry particularly in the last 10 years. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves character driven movies.
B0002JP4L4|5.0|More than just an 80's teen movie, Footloose is a film that just gets it all done.  Okay sure you have the classic scene that takes forever when K-Bacon is running around a giant warehouse like spider man, but it is more!  So much more people, these kids you see they are in this town that outlaws dancing.  The kids want to have a prom and then this guy that K-Bacon plays, well he blows in from like, Chicago or somewhere.   Now this was filmed in some small mill town in Utah but in the movie I do not recall them saying what state this is in.  Anyways it does not matter, cuz K-bake is a threat because he is an outsider and different and is into expression.  So it is really about how dancing is expression.  So K-Bake kicks but all the way around.  The scene at the meeting where the girl actually quotes from the bible about how they \\"celebrated and danced\\" is totally awesome (no 80's pun intended) because dude the strict do-gooders in the film are hearing this in the town meeting or whatever and they about have a friggin hernia!  Heads almost explode, yeah!  Just a fine movie and K-Bacon steals the show!  And yes, 20 years later he would go on to be in Stir of Echoes and spend half a movie digging his backyard up with a shovel.
B000O75F7C|3.0|Well the present music effort dated April 2007 is very interesting, even though I have to   remark a few defects inside, as for a certain spacey refrain within their main tunes, which   seem to be just a little bit forced , above all in comparison to their usual standard.   Nevertheless there are some gems inside such as \\"My ashes\\", especially regarding of the   stunning chorus performed by Wilson in the best manner...then you can appreciate  the 17   minutes long mini-suite`Anesthetize', the most melodic among their best tunes, as well as   such an interesting Alex Lifeson solo, introducing the most heavy part of the album!!   Therefore I can't forget the psychedelic touch of `Way Out of Here', perhaps the most   experimental song  of the whole cd, but for instance the lyrics of \\"Sleep Together' seem to   be quite far away from their best moments, as a sort of controversial artistic   expression ...anyway the mood of their work is strong and quite original too, despite their   strangest songs sometimes not being inspiring at all... so at the end make your own choice,   especially if you are an old fan of the American band and you can forgive them this way for   every diverse - sometimes controversial - kind of expression you will find here!
B000J103PC|3.0|so so film, if you like Streep's character acting like a pain in the arse with Hathaway at her beck and call.  Pretty lame ending because seriously for her to...well let me just say that her boyfriend in the movie was a schmuck who did not deserve a girl like that in the first place.  Hey writers of this movie, do not paint a guy to be a loser but then try to make him out to be some nice guy with some interest in stuff, guys who sit around eating pizza all day and not giving a crap about the ladies who love them really are losers!
B000NHG7BG|4.0|no problems with this DVD; this is a very good movie and I like the extra materia; in fact anything they still have and didn't add to the movie will make it better because it's so good
B00005N5S5|5.0|Tripping, dude in real life is pumping iron and winning Mr. Universe awards, beating out that Ferrigno guy that played the Hulk.  Then he plays this cyborg dude that comes to Earth to kill off a lady whose son will lead a future revolution against the Robots.  Yeah I know you are thinking dang, Bill Gates was probably in on this!  No, he was not but Linda Hamilton rox yo world as Sara Connor, now you can spell that Sarah Conner or Sara Connor or whatever, I don't care.  What I do care about is that this film really opens the eyes to a bad dude.  This dude has red eyes and he gave a whole new attitude in 1984 when he had one ripped out, shrugged and simply donned some blades.  Yeah black leather jackets as well.  Oh man and then he just starts ripping up this police station!    Well c'mon, not very realistic.  Sure you can have cyborgs come here and do stuff, they do all the time but usually they are just in Vegas playing the odds while on a stopover from Venus.  Okay the worst part is this...a waitress from Los Angeles suddenly becomes the cops main concern?  Yeah right that did not happen in the whole O.J. deal now did it?  Real life this lady would not have made it and by the time the cops even had gotten hot on the trail, the Terminator would have been jumping around time warps so much his head would be spinning!      Classic Sci-Fi starring Arnie, who is now a Guv-nah but still pumps iron.
B000OONQ9O|2.0|The Blu Ray HD is pefect!  Everything looks like you are on the scene.  HD gives you the closet thing to a time machine! Very few movies actuall LOOK old in HD.    The bad part is, this \\"director's cut\\" sucks!  They claim it was how he originally wanted it to be, but if that were true, he could have done it!  There were no technology restrictions back then!  All he did was butcher this film in an attempt to try an modernize it and make it look 'cool' for the young people of today while completely forgetting about those who grew up with the film!    This comic book transistions BS is a distraction while watching.  It makes it look silly.  I know the film on a whole (the gangs) look silly now, but you can deal with that on it's own without them trying to make it look as if they made it look silly on purpose.  Also, many songs in the film run a lot longer and overlap dialog that was previously there!  This is also distracting and takes away some of the suspense.  They even totally edited out the end 'walk on the beach scene' and replaced it with a static comic strip!  That alone ruined this 'cut.'  That scene said alot.  It represented the end, the end as in the Warriors are presumably going home and the end of the movie.  It is also the memorable scene I recall of cabel all those years ago.  These cuts were almost as bad as the Star Wars DVD's!    What they should do is to in clude the original intro which truly sets up the story.  Forget that it took place in the daylight!  They should alos include all deleted scens to give in some length and GET RID OF THE COMIC BOOK BS!    The sound is horrible!  That is, the Dolby Digital.  The center channel(dialog) disappears and the channels get crossed.  You end up not being able to watch it in surround sound!  I hope it is not my amp, but I have not had a problem up to this point.  This sound is hard to deal with.  If the channels were correct, it would be fine.  I await the \\"director's orignal cut!\\"
0060755598|5.0|This is required reading for anyone considering going into business or currently in business for themselves, especially if their business is taking more of their precious time than they wished.  You must know your numbers.  It has been a real eye opener.    Jorick
0374105235|3.0|I was expecting this to be quite a revealing book about the manipulation of young children in a war torn country.  Instead it is quite different as it focuses mainly on Ishamel running from the Rebel forces and basically stumbling into the so called armed forces and ending up as a recruit.  Very little of the story actually revolves around what Ishmael does whilst a member of the armed forces, instead the second half of the book tells his stoy of rehabilitation and reintegration into a normal society.  If you expect to hear the blood & guts war story then you will be disappointed.  If you are after a more thought revealling and harrowing story about one young persons struggle to come out alive against all the odds then you will be pleased with this book.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|\\"Later that day I got to thinking about relationships. There are those that open you up to something new and exotic, those that are old and familar, those that bring up lots of questions, those that bring you somewhere unexpected, those that bring you far from where you started, and those that bring you back* (*punctuated with the sound of Samantha c*ming)\\". But the most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And if you find someone to love the 'you', you love...well thats just fabulous!\\"<br /><br />With that very last voice-over, I watched TV character, Carrie Bradshaw peer down at her cell phone, giggle, and disappear down Fifth Avenue wearing her Manolo Blahniks and carrying a Fendi bag in hand. I had just spent almost once a week, for the past twenty-some months, watching all 94 episodes of \\"Sex and the City-The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)\\". And you know what? It was all...so worth it!<br /><br />Each week I would find some alone time for just a half hour, with no other worldly distractions, so I could follow the social/sexual adventures of four smart, sophisticated, stylishly dressed women (all friends) as they hilariously made their way through the trendy, concrete dating jungle of Manhattan. These four women included sex columnist and shoe fanatic, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), preppy, idealistic, art dealer, Charlotte York (Kristin Davis), cynical lawyer Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon) and finally PR spin-meister and sexual adventurer, Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall).<br /><br />In the early episodes of the series it seems like we are being treated to an almost comic anthropological study of men, women, dating and sex. Carrie would pose a question on the Mac for her column and their adventures would come up with the answers. But as the series goes on, we watch the changes in these characters as they emotionally grow and evolve. We get to experience with them, both the highs and lows of their lives. This includes boyfriends, marriages, a birth, sickness and all the other messy stuff that comes along. And through all this, these four friends wittily comment (in sometimes hilariously graphic language), laugh and cry as they get together. In the end these women always have each other for support. They are always there for each other. It's what friendship is all about. And that I think is why this show went from merely being just a well written, well acted comedy to becoming something really special for both its' fans and TV history.<br /><br />This 20-disc \\"Complete Collectors Set\\" is much more covenient (and cheaper) then buying the individual seasons. The pink, furry, book-like, packaging includes sepia toned photos of the cast and brief descriptions of each episode. The seasons are color coded for easy identification. The only packaging drawback is that the cardboard pockets can easily scratch the discs. (My anwer to this is to keep the current disc you're using in a spare CD jewel case.) The extras include two HBO tributes to the show, a taping of a lively (and funny!) writers forum and a small amount of deleted scenes, season by season. Best of all are the episode commentary tracks from Writer/Director Michael Patrick King. His commentary is both interesting and incisive, giving both detailed analysis of each episode's themes plus all the great poop about the behind the scenes stuff! They were a pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />So, here it is, twenty-some months from when I first started watching \\"Sex and the City-The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)\\". What is there to do now? Why start all over course! I'm sure the ride will be just as fun...boyfriends, marriages, a birth, sickness and all the other messy stuff that comes along.

B000PMGS8G|3.0|I've been waiting years to get a hold of a DVD of this movie.  I don't have the ability to view the European Version and I wanted to wait for a version that had better quality than what the \\"Brazilian\\" version offered.<br /><br />I'm happy to finally have a copy of this Sci_fi classic, but I think the quality lacks.  Color resolution is terrible - all the actors have mostly blue skin, just for starters.  The focus is also blury in many scenes.<br /><br />I'm also dissapointed with what the set contains - for the size of the box, I expected a booklet about the film or even a second DVD of editorials and such.
B000R34V50|5.0|After seeing the preview for this movie... i wasn't very impressed. I didn't understand why they had to make the movie an animated movie. I didn't understand why the turtles were so damn skinny. I wasn't convinced at all that it was going to be a great movie, but i had to watch it anyways because i've always been a TMNT fan.    Boy was i wrong. The movie turned out great! I like how the story began... it was different and it was something i wasn't expecting. The movie was funny and entertaining. As soon as the movie ended, i already knew i had to have it.     The Video quality is excellent! You can't really go too wrong in making a animated movie a blu ray release, but there's a scene in the movie *Leo vs Ralph: on top of the rooftop* that is just so amazing to watch.     The Sound quality was good. I can't really say it was great or horrible, but the sound was good enough for me.    A must add for your collection for blu-ray/TMNT fans!!!
0385522401|5.0|\\"How extraordinary it was, that a self-made spoonful, leaping clear of his body, should instantly free his mind to confront afresh Nelson's decisiveness at Aboukir Bay.\\"<br /><br />My favorite sentence (sort of John O'Hara meets Monty Python) of this exquisite text showcases McEwan's deft writing.  It's 1962, and all about releasing the mind, to free oneself, to let inhibition out the door.  Letting the Mods replace Edwardian England.  But repression and untold histories ensnare our bride and groom in their wedding night chambers.  Resolution hangs in the balance.<br /><br />That neither Edward (so Edwardian) nor Florence (so Classical, and un-Modern) can achieve a state of bliss even on their wedding night, not to mention a year of courtship, brings the reader slowly, steadily to share in the anxiety and frustration.  Performance pressure builds and builds and builds.  The first chapter of this brief novella originally appeared in The New Yorker late last year, (search McEwan at that publication's website).  What a maddening tease to the magazine reader that the story left us in the wedding chamber just minutes before ... what?  Consumation?  Disaster?<br /><br />But McEwan does not stop there.  Through four more chapters he continues to torture and torque up the tension.  Will they?  Won't they?  How could they not?  Making this the longest wedding night adventure in literary history, McEwan drags us tantalizingly across every brainwave of both hero and heroine.  If you enjoyed the moment-by-moment neurological tours of Henry Perowne's mind in SATURDAY, you will surely relish ON CHESIL BEACH.  And you may even learn how the mere thought of Prime Minister Harold MacMillan might enhance your next escapade.
0634060384|5.0|Excellent edition. The music is clearly laid out and easy to read. There's more than enough music to keep any jazz musician busy for the rest of their lives! All the standards and more. Also recommend Volume 2.
B000002552|3.0|The complete remastered Basement tapes was released in a bootleg edition of 500 copies known as Tree With Roots but this went out of print almost as soon as it was released. Most people have never heard the most legendary songs from these sessions, such as \\"I'm Not There\\". Besides these omissions, the real glory of the Basement tapes is in the amazing songs that Dylan was writing at this period, and his down home performances of the material with the Band. By breaking these gems up with grossly inferior Band out-takes from different sessions like \\"Ain't No More Cane\\", this official version of the Basement Tapes is a disjointed and unpleasurable listening experience. The best you can do with this edition is to burn your own version, sequencing the Dylan songs as you prefer and omitting the Band tracks. This will produce an experience similar to the original bootleg releases of the Basement tapes. Still we are missing some of Dylan's best material. Maybe the release of the new movie, \\"I'm Not There\\" will inspire Dylan and Sony to release the complete Basement sessions (without the Band material).
B000QUCNP4|2.0|After spending over two and a half hours watching the movie it degenerated into three screens of small illegible text. They may as well have placed the text after the first half hour and I would be left in the same situation. Had I wanted to read the book I would have bought the book. Tip to directors: If you cannot end the story by telling the story through the screen play don't make the movie.
0066620996|2.0|While it had some interesting metephors, it still depends on that and buzz words as its primary messege.  I didn't really dislike it, but another book called Managing Transitions is one that dosn't depend on the latest buz and calls it like it is.
1591841666|2.0|If you suffer from insomnia or need a penance this is the book for you.  If you wonder why its so small, its because there is so little the author has to say.  Every chapter is a repeat of the previous.  The main point would make a nice article or long blog entry.
055358202X|5.0|Many people have indeed found flaws in A Feast for Crows. Mainly due to reasons such as:  1. Their favourite characters not appearing.  2. Characters they don't like appearing.  3. Slow-paced action.  4. \\"Nothing\\" happening.    Well, if the disappointment comes from love of Tyrion-Jon-Dany and an inability to read everything unrelated to them, that's not a flaw of the books. If it comes from hatred of Brienne of Tarth, who I find as good a character as all the others, then again it's not Martin's fault.    It is true that this book lacks action. Let's say that A Song of Ice and Fire is a rollercoaster. Game of Thrones was going up, Clash of Kings was a little more uphill and then down. Storm of Swords was the biggest, scary, thrilling, amazing downward slope in the highest rollercoaster you've ever seen. And then, A Feast for Crows feels like the typical part of the rollercoaster that comes after the big falldown: it's slower and less thrilling, true, but no less great.    After all the adrenaline of a Storm of Swords, I actually thanked the slower pace of AFFC. After all, the war is almost over. The realm faces a Winter that will probably last at least six years, and that after a devastating war, is torn and shredded. We are being shown the calm between the storms. The truce is uneasy, yet the destruction is there. I understand that AFFC has less action, but what it tells is just as interesting. We have mainly seen the lords at ladies at their game of thrones. Now we see the results, and the smallfolk situation after the war. It's beautiful, interesting, and poetic. I am also among the ones who hate stories about \\"reality\\" and love epicism and \\"high sphere\\" stuff. But in A Song oIF, this parenthesis about the little people is interesting and beautiful. Besides, you get to know very important things... Problem with ASoIaF is that you always have to re-read and/or get into forums to keep pace with what's happening. Once you do, it happens to be amazing.     Brienne'sPOV seems the cause of complain of many people. Precisely through her POVs is how the countryside and smallfolk of Westeros are being shown to us. I enjoyed her POVs inmensely... I know she didn't get to fulfill her mission, but remember that her mission this time was harder than finding the needle in the haystack. Brienne is searching in a whole CONTINENT for a girl who doesn't want to be found. No wonder she's having trouble. But we see her quest as a knigh from a fresh and interesting point of view. Yes, it's dirty, it's bloody and it's hard. What did people expect that being a knight in an errand meant? That's the glory of it: even Brienne didn't know it would be as hard. Real life are not songs...    I also loved this book for personal reasons. I have the absolute belief that evil saws the seeds of its own destruction, though slowly... and that good expand by its own... slowly too. I like this book because in it I see that principle applied. Not by great luck to the heroes, not by divine intervention or karma. Merely by absolute cold-blooded logical relation cause-effect. Some of the most bastardly characters get their cruel actions back at them. The goody-goody two shoes don't end very well. And the generous, good ones who have the necessary splinter of cunning and necessary cruelty, get the better of it. Luck and bad luck also play an important role. But, whatever happens, your acts, the good and the bad, may come back to you.     I also love in this book, the chapters of Jaime Lannister. One of the best written personalities I've ever read.    Sansa and Arya's developments are also great.    As I said before, this books is not boring. It has, indeed, less action than the previous one, but you can hardly put more action than there was in ASOS. This is the unquiet calm before the next storm. The unhealed wounds and unsolved enmities are still there, hanging. It's a book with tension more than with action. It is still beautiful, well written, well characterized and well plotted. I yearn to see A Dance with Dragons, but I yearn much more for Winter Winds and A Dream of Spring.    The main criticism of the book is from people who missed their favourite characters (who wouldn't miss Tyrion, indeed). As for me, I have such a score of favourite characters that the ones in this book were no less favourite than the missing ones. So I really enjoyed it.    As a recommendation, I advise everyone to read which POVs are included in this book, so they won't be dissappointed in that. And I also recommend them to read prepared for less action and more introspection. Apart from that, this one is my second favourite book in the series, after ASOF. A definitely must read.

It doesn't matter what your politics might be, but its better if you are a US flag waver, this book demostrates the desire of some people to do their best no matter what the hardship.  It reconfirms that we still have the right stuff in the USA.
B000ICM5MG|5.0|I will admit this now, before i start the review. Rocky is my all-time favourite film, something you probably didn't know about me.     Rocky follows the story of Rocky Balboa, a boxer whose career takes a tough turn, subject to fighting mediorce talent and dealing with a fierce timekeeper, the owner of the gym. His days are dominated by being a lone shark for a lazy boss and mainly boxing matches at night to scrap up money. Rocky idolises the current Heavyweight Champion, who he claims \\"took his best shot\\", but when a disaster strikes with his fortcoming match with Mac Lee Green, a boxing promoter comes calling and Rocky's life changes.................     Rocky is a simple film with a low budget made under one million dollars. The most important aspect of this, is what happens to the central character, the focus and subsquent change, the chance he receives.     What i loved about Rocky could be made up in the following points which are: his desire to make his voice heard; his kindness and wanting to be understood, where his intelligance lacks and the determination to prove himself worthy.     Often regarded as the born to play role, Stallone made Rocky an outcast, where teasing and patornising comments, hurt him personally as his he always considered a retard. Stallone makes Rocky feel, he can do this, but doesn't withstand any oppertunity without real guidance. You care about Rocky, because he isn't nasty, selfish or bitter, he is a geniune human being, a man who wants society to notice his kindness rather than inteligance.     Talia Shire co-stars as Adrian the shy girl who works in the Pet Shop, whom Rocky has affection for, but is bullied by the more experienced and able Gloria. Her performance shows the boost in her confidence during, especially with the encouragement by Rocky, who they draw together since they are able to fill in gaps of judgement.     The scene stealing performance however, belongs to Burgess Meredith as Mick, the fierce timekeeper who is protrayed as a fragile, broken hearted man, unfulfiled by his once miserable boxing career. His temper, often gets the better of his personality and often struggles to understand Rocky's stance.     Other performances of noteworthy include the abusive, arrogant, dependant on drink, Pauline, Adrian's brother and the role of Apollo Creed, who was not patrotic in his finest stride but willing to take a gamble to please his nation.     The editing of Rocky focuses on Rocky's friendship with Paulie; his apparent, gentle relationship with Adrian who encouraged him to go all the way, Rocky's training sequences, especially the touching run to Phildelphia Art Museum, a glowing moment and the long dragging fight.     The music to Rocky is enthuastic with the introduction of the thumping muted trumpet fanfare right through to the closing slender, but soft operatic of a string quartet, highlighting the feelings that we have just witnessed.     Rocky was definteley the worthwile winner of Best Picture, a true landmark in film. Rocky changed cinema altogether with a downbeat American white-collar community in the abstrait, which a man wants to escape from to succeed. Rocky is a classic and don't you \\"ever\\" forget that.

B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand by Me, was the second film, directed by Rob Reiner, son of Carl Reiner, known best for his television work in the US and for launching the career of one Steve Martin.     Reiner was faithful to what Stephen King wanted, he was familiar with the material that could work and wouldn't. He made subsquent trimmings on the novel, so that the most important things for example, outlying the real friendship between Chris and Gordie being dominant, the way they communicate and approach their troubles in white-collar broken families with hard drinking fathers, which they refer to as \\"their old men\\". The film does not detact from Gordie's nostalgic narration as an adult, it is in some ways, tighter and easy to follow than the novel in this case.     A good tip, i will offer is, it is better to read the short story, The Body upon what the material is based on. There you will understand deeper the character of Chris Chambers; his father's binges; why his brother was known as \\"Eyeball\\" Chambers; his discontent for School; also indulge in Will's ambitious writing talent and their continuing friendship long after this episode which is very benefital as important. You will really enjoy it more, honest, i have.     Stand for Me, follows in particular, a young boy known as Gordon \\"Gordy\\" Lacha, who after losing his brother to a tragic accident, goes on an adventure with his best friend, Chris and the two pals they hang around with, Teddy and Vern, to retrieve the body of Ray Brower, a missing boy out for a raspberry picking.     This is effectively a character driven piece, with a great stunt piece, the runaway train sequence, the confronations between the friends, trying to abine and then drift apart as friends do, when they feel they have nothing left to prove and the jokes shared and the mere messing around.     This is Phoenix's shining performance, that makes this one. He plays Chris Chambers, who knows he is \\"able\\" to make a difference, when Gordie's anxiety with his parents wears him down, he is more than eager to show him, that if he doesn't listen to what is right, then he could lose his most valved dream of all. Chambers on the other hand, knows he has to help, but doesn't know how to do it properly, he is frightened he could hurt Gordie and that was point, he was making.     Stand by Me is also a film, where youngsters have to face up for their future, in a world of uncertainy, dreams broken and lies discussed, people who have to grow up on their own with or without their friends.     Stand by Me was a sleeper hit, it did manage to reach number tweleve on the top box office receipts of 1986 in the US, but in recent years, since Phoenix's passing, the film has become a reminder of how sad life can be and so unfortunate to so many people, it has hence become more powerful, it's popularity has continued to flourish on it's dedicated cult base and will continue to do so, as long as people have a dream for desire.

B0009UC7QQ|5.0|The Truman Show became Peter Weir's sixth project in the States and could be arguably, his greatest work since the beginning of his career. Working alongside New Zealander Andrew Niccol, this appealing, likeable and self-panning satire just occured, prior to the big boom of reality television. The title, The Truman Show is known as a play-on-words, since it is supposed to be poking fun and putting him in deep scrunity at the same time. His name, Truman Burbank is a pun. Truman really is an apprevation of True Man and Burbank is the name of the famous Warner Bros studio lot, hence the town in the studio he lives in.     Truman Burbank is an ordinary man, unaware of his existance twenty-four hours a day on an American television channel, broadcast around the world on a so-called inhabitated island called Seahaven enclosed in a studio complex. Burbank slowly unveils the truth of life on the island when a camera falls from the sky.......     The Truman Show was a strange project for Jim Carrey, but one that suits his physical crazy-man style of comedy, so many favours. You can understand why Carrey took a part like this which relates to his personality through little clues more than anything else he has done. His performance as Truman Burbank reveals him to be a man who experiences restrictment from the time he was very young in many forms seen so vividly. Carrey makes him invisiable and skeptical. Laura Linney is brillant as his commerical engrossive all-50s American housewife. Noah Emmerich protrays his best friend, Marlon, who reministic of their childhood memories and his obbession to keep him safe always, don't prove to the answers nor the person, Burbank thinks he is looking to up and should trust. Christof, the rarely seen reclusive creator comes across as a distinct loner, prone to angry stares and shows a lack of humour. Also, note how the personalities on screen, are just minicks of the real people, who couldn't care less about the main attraction.     Peter Weir's direction shows the view of the world; the sudden close-ups; the cheesy humour and repetitive behaviour as well making Christof's studio seem fascinating, but very domineering and grey. The editing work gives an appropriate parrallell life towards Truman's eyes and the world in which Christof lives in as well which emphasises the main themes of lonliness, reclusion, the media's intrepretion and self-esteem.     The Truman Show is a candid look at an over exaggerated idea, that people know \\"could\\" never prosper, but with the things that reality television is capable of doing like trapping people in a forest or house, we may never know what the risks they are more than willing to achieve for audience interest.
B000066C6Z|2.0|I loved the Naked Gun Trilogy, and Airplane had many funny moments .... but DO NOT BUY \\"Top Secret\\" without renting it through Netflix or Blockbuster, or heck, I'll give you my copy! This movie is soooooooo much slower-paced than the others mentioned earlier that I was literally nodding off at 10:00 PM!  The gags were so weak that we actually found ourselves saying ... \\"Oh, there was a funny one\\".  Unfortunately, that only happened about once every 15 minutes.  How sad.  If a movie is truly funny you don't sit there thinking back and saying when was the last time I laughed during this.  Even at $6.99, I feel like I wasted my money.  Learn from our mistake and save 90 minutes of your life (you'll thank us later)!!!
B000286RKW|5.0|(Warning: Goodfellas contains strong use of profanity, graphic violence and a number of murders)     Based on Nicholas Pileggi 1987 auto-biographical novel, originally titled Wise Guys about Henry Hill's real life escapde in the mafia guided by mentor Paul Cierro from 1955 to 1980.     Henry Hill fantasies an opportunity to become a mobster seeing them play their cards across the street in the local Italian cafe every night through his bedroom window. Soon, after his start of a dedicated part-time job parking cars for them, he is involved quickly with Paul Cierro and turns into a reality.........     Goodfellas a stunning concotion of music, madness, drug addiction, obession, murders and risk-taking all seen through the eyes of Henry Hill, a sort of outsider and informer. The film adaption bears wear to the novel, even if sections of his life are cut for time which might slow down and drag like Henry's entire time being drafted into the US army in 1958/59; serving time in Allenwood as part of the remainder of his time at Lewisburg from 1974 to 1978; changes to character names such as Jimmy Burke who became Jimmy Conway in the film; Paul Cierro's time spent behind bars in the early days and Henry funding for Karen and her daughters who live in muliple housing including cramp conditions as opposed to the house Henry bought for them after his parole release in the film from Lewisburg in 1974.     Goodfellas appears very slick thanks to the well artililated and researched narration holding each and every single scene together to keep the flow by Ray Liotta which he studied off tapes of the real Henry Hill to capture the voice, mood and essence of mafia life. The editing of Goodfellas keeps the story intriguing with the use of freeze frames and chapters only an example to highlight the fast paced lives the characters lead and the dangers they are always exposed to as a moment to take breath, also to refresh your mind, the next moment it starts again nice and easy. Scorsese shows his taste in popular music with the Rolling Stones, Cream and Eric Clapton shaping up the content. The songs mirror the accurary on the scenes. For example, a short extract of Sunshine of our love is played just as about Jimmy is to light up with a big smile upon his face which was to emphasise he was having the time of his life about to give someone their just desserts. Another example, Leader of the Pack was to emphasise how the girls at the beauty palor said Ginny couldn't survive without her husband who stood up for himself but was caught and how later on it is suggested that he is treated as a past love, but never forgotten which is metaphorically like the final outcome of the lyrics.     Goodfellas is apparently still standing as a modern classic seventeen years on, after his original theatrical release, which nearly didn't receive because of the distasterous test screenings. Buy today and never regret, you don't get a film as entertaining, humourous, realistic or as scary as this one.

1594489505|5.0|This was the best book I've ever read - hands down - which really surprised me because I was fully expecting that nothing could top The Kite Runner. I love the way Khaled Hosseini captures the best and worst of human nature in his characters, how he tells heartbreaking stories about people who make the difficult choices and end up doing wonderful things for the people they love, no matter the cost. All with a political, historical backdrop that is timely and fascinating, as a Westerner, to learn about and try to better understand.     As a woman, I really connected with Mariam and Laila, and through Hosseini's eloquent \\"fiction,\\" to a sense of what life has been like for the women who have lived through the rise and fall of the Taliban over the past decades in Afghanistan. Their stories forced me to really imagine what it would be like to have no control over my own destiny, no freedom, no ally in the legal system or the government. Forget about education, health care or any public services. At the worst of times these women had only their own raw strength of character, each other, their children, their memories of the past and belief that things would someday get better. For a time, they had no choice but to duck under life, just trying to find a way to survive from one day to the next.     How lucky we are to have a writer - and humanitarian - like Hosseini active in our time, who's stories remind us of the unthinkable evil and redemptive good that we are capable of as human beings. These things connect us all, no matter where we live or what flag we pledge allegiance to. In a time of war, the decisions made and actions taken by Hosseini's protagonists are inspiring examples of deep friendship, love, sacrifice, immense bravery, and ultimate hope in the face of the very worst of circumstances.
6300215512|4.0|There was a murder at one of the big houses out on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. A body is in the pool, shot twice in the back and once in the front. It all started with a screen writer in Hollywood was down on his luck and hoped to make money on a script. [There are shots of sparse traffic in those days.] Fleeing from the car repossessors Joe Gillis ducks into the driveway of a big mansion, seemingly deserted. The owner mistakes him for someone else. A lucky break? An elderly woman expected an undertaker for her pet chimp. Norma Desmond used to be big in silent pictures; but the pictures got smaller. Norma commands Gillis to read her script, a melodrama about &#34;Salome&#34; ( beautiful young woman who asked a high price for dancing). [Gloria Swanson plays the demented actress as if she was born for the part. Erich Von Stroheim plays an old retainer, her sole servant. Why can't Norma have other servants?]   Gillis works on the script, Norma's commands must be obeyed. Old silent movies are shown for entertainment. The classic Isotta-Fraschini automobile is revived for touring, another relic of a by-gone era. [Is Joe the replacement for Norma's pet chimp?] The New Year's party shows how upset Norma can get when her whims are disregarded. Gillis flees to a friend's place for a change of atmosphere. A phone call from Max brings bad news, so Joe returns to the mansion. [Does money buy happiness? Not for the discontented.] Gillis is content to continue to work for Norma. A visit to a film studio shows the workings of film production in Hollywood. C.B. De Mille shows his appreciation, others are impressed in meeting the famous Norma Desmond. But the reason for the call to Norma is not for what she expected.   Joe Gillis visits another writer to work on a script. They see the sets that are made to look real for the camera. [The camera never lies?] Max Von Mayerling explains why he is so protective of Madame [guilt complex?]. There is a complication in working with Betty Shaffer. Norma calls Betty to warn her about Joe, and this leads to the dramatic crisis. Joe chooses wealth over poverty and love (a change from the usual Hollywood stories). Did Joe choose wisely? Is it wise to challenge the illusions of a deranged mind? And so this film has an unhappy ending. Fade to black.   There is unconscious symbolism in this film. The rise of television was followed by a decline in the movie audience and the wealth of Hollywood studios. Television provided new opportunities for actors, writers, and producers. Truly, the pictures got smaller. Are there fewer parts for older actresses or actors today? What will happen when the jobs get sent offshore to cartoon studios?
B000MRAAJW|5.0|There is no better way to watch this type of series than in a full 1080p High-Definition medium.  I've seen things in this series I never knew existed.  The photography is absolutely astounding, and the high-definition time lapses are amazing!  David Attenborough's narration is excellent as well.

0446677450|2.0|The advice in the book seemed very general; save money, create assests, avoid overspending, etc.  There were few specific lines of advice, but perhaps that wasn't the intent of the book. I kept waiting for the author to start explaining real ways to start investing, etc.  He gave no starting points for someone actually looking to change their financial path.  Either need to be rich already or be really young.    The author also portrays his education-career \\"poor dad\\" in a very weak light.  Mainly because he's a school teacher and seems family and people centered.  Of course, I'd like to be a millionaire, but not at the cost of kindness, my family, and the use of intimidation.  The \\"rich dad\\" seemed very jerkish.    On the other hand, the book is quite inspirational and does a good job of getting the blood moving.  It creates a good picture for someone to realize what financial traps they often set for themselves and what their potential could be.

B00003CXTG|1.0|This film contains everything and only everything that's wrong with America today:     Glaring discrimination in favor of attractive people.  All the \\"heroes\\" are astonishingly attractive men and women. While I don't have anything against attractive men and women, it's just so obvious that that's the reason why they were chosen for those roles. The real heroes in Pearl Harbor didn't come from Entertainment Magazine. They were made of common clay. Some maybe attractive, some maybe not so attractive.    Not history so much as propoganda:  They make it seem like before Pearl Harbor America was the only reason Britain was still standing on two feet. Sort of like America was fighting the war before it started fighting the war. Now I'm an American and am proud of our nation's accomplishments, but I'm not proud of the distorted image of history that this movie falsely suggests. There were indeed some American pilots who volunteered to help Britain before Pearl Harbor. But these were few and far between. Like every other nation, America was in it to advance its own interests. And that involved squeezing Britain by trading British bases in the Caribean in return for giving them some, yes, crucial war supplies.    Nothing original (let me amend that: nothing original that is good).  We've seen this type of love story in the movies so many times and it has been done oh so much better. Even though they're attractive, it's ironic that the bad chemistry makes it just painful to watch.    Off the top of my head, I can think of one movie that I dislike about as much as this one: Armageddon. But at least Armageddon knew that it wasn't portraying reality and didn't expect its audience to think it reflected reality.    Simply dreadful.
B000023VR9|5.0|At a time when the west coast was dropping hit album after hit album, Dr. Dre hits us with his second solo LP The Chronic 2001. Basically that album brought back the west and blew many albums from '99 out of the water. 2001 has some of the best west coast production you will be able to find curteosy of the Doctor himself. Rounding up many guests on this album such as Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Hittman, and other popular artists, he really serves up a high quality album.<br /><br />Of course Dre didn't write all the lyrics. Emimem's former partner in rhyme Royce Da 5'9\\" as well as Jay-Z penned some of the rhymes here. On \\"The Watcher\\" (think Jay-Z's \\"The Takeover\\" lyrically), Dre drops some excellent production that easilly bangs. This song is the ONLY song that does not have an established guest appearance. The next track \\"F You\\" features Snoop Dogg and Devin The Dude. That track is self explanitory. \\"Still D.R.E.\\" is the lead single off this album with some more phenomonal production. The video is awesome as well, if you seen it. \\"Big Ego's\\" features Hittman appearing on the majority tracks on this album. \\"Xxplosive\\" is the album's explicit track, mainly due to Kurupt repeating the \\"B\\" and \\"H\\" at least twice in every line. Believe it or not, that is my favorite track, also features Hittman, Nate Dogg, and Six-Two. \\"What's The Difference\\" Dr. Dre reminesses the past in his earlier days and what he is going through at the time. Xzibit and Eminem drops hot verses as well. After a skit comes \\"Light Speed\\" with Hittman and a female named Ms. Roq doing the hook over a tight beat. Next is a very popular track \\"Forgot About Dre\\" features Eminem. Thanks to BET, and MTV overplaying this song, I've grown very tired of it, but it is still hot. Another popular track is \\"The Next Episode\\" features Kurupt, Snoop Dogg, and Nate Dogg which borders suffering the same fate as it's preceeding song. \\"Lets Get H***\\" is a party/sex track that features Hittman, Kurupt, and Ms. Roq. \\"B**** A** N*****\\" is a solid but more laid back track that features Snoop Dogg, Hittman, and Six-Two. After a skit, we have Hittman and Ms. Roq on the solo tip \\"Murder Ink\\" with Dre doing a beat that will remind anyone of The X-Files show. Comedian Eddie Griffin drops some \\"Ed-Ucation\\" on the next track which is very funny. Then we have a west coast posse cut on \\"Some L.A. ******\\" features King T, Xzibit, Defari, MC Ren, Knoc'trunal as well as others. After a sex skit, we have \\"Housewife\\" that features Hittman and Kurupt. A modified version of that song appears on Kurupt's [[ASIN:B000028TWH Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha]], which was ironically released the same day as this album. \\"Ackrite\\" features Hitman on the solo tip again over a bumping Dre beat. \\"Bang Bang\\" features Hittman, and Knoc'turnal. The final track is \\"The Message\\" a deep touching track dedicated to his deceased brother featuring Mary J. Blige and Rell.<br /><br />To me 2001 is a west coast classic. Did Dre bring back the west coast? Yes, but he can thank other albums like [[ASIN:B00000IMGM No Limit Top Dogg]], [[ASIN:B00000AFAC Kuruption! Bi-Coastal Edition Volumes l & ll]], [[ASIN:B00001T3H6 I Want It All]], [[ASIN:B00001IVOY 40 Dayz & 40 Nightz]] for the help as well as others, because he didn't do it all by himself. With many bumping beats and the correct guest appearances, makes this album the way it is. I picked up this album when was 14, and must have spun it over 100 times between 1999 and 2000, at the same time fearing that my Dad would walk in on me while I was playing this album, and confiscate it (theres enough profanity on here to offend Richard Pryor). Anyway, 2001 is an album I highly recommend to any rap fan. Peace.<br /><br />Lyrics: A<br />Production: A+<br />Guest Appearances: A<br />Musical Vibes: A+<br /><br />Top 5 Tracks:<br />1.

0618680004|5.0|Rejoice! my friends, and sing hosanas unto the great Richard Dawkins, for he has brought unto the opressed masses a Way, a Path, a Guiding Light to a new freedom for the world. (Badger XXXV, Chapter 8, verse 10)    Ok, perhaps that's a tad overblown. :)    This book is many things. It's well-written, entertaining, a little bombastic and a little snide at times. I many ways it's almost atheist dogma. But it isn't ever dull and in all these things it's also something else.    It's a splash of cold water to the brain.    It's a wake-up for all those people out there who truly don't believe anymore, but feel that, for whatever reason (work, family, society, etc), they have to continue to pretend they do.    Religion puzzles me and in many ways always has. This, mind you, from a man who has stacks of books on mythology, three Bibles and a Koran. I honestly don't think people believe much of what they say they do. I think they THINK they believe it, but I don't think they do. If that makes sense.    I have a friend who lives in Oklahoma. He's gay and stuck in the so-called Bible-Belt. He was raised in a fairly religious family, but doesn't really believe anymore. He's still trying to come to grips with his lack of faith/superstition, and so I bought him a copy of this book. I hope it helps.    To anyone else in a similar situation to his, I highly recommend this book, and a visit to James Randi's website at randi.org where he has a blog. He's recently been discussing some of the psychological issues that occasionally happen when people undergo the sort of revelation, as it were, that this book can give them.    To the confirmed atheists out there, I recommend this book to help you bolster your own arguements when dealing with those of faith.    And to the religious of the world, confusing though I find you to be, I recommend this book. Yes. If for no other reason than to \\"know thine enemy\\". But also cause you might learn a thing or two.    And for those who want a less serious, but still effective, glimpse at faith and what it can cause, I suggest [[ASIN:0061020656 Pyramids]] and [[ASIN:0061092177 Small Gods]], both by Terry Pratchett and both quite excellent.    Finally this book is excellent for anyone who is lost in the woods or drifing at sea. I don't mean that in a metaphorical way, mind you. I'm just saying that the shinny cover makes a dandy signal mirror! :)
B000UR9T8C|5.0|Spider-man 3 rocks! i know some people might disagree with me, but i do agree there was parts in there that didnt need to be in there and be re-placed with more action. once again the cast from the previous installments did a fantastic job aswell as sam raimi. i only wished we got to see more action with spidey in the alien costume causing trouble etc. aswell as seeing more of venom. i really enjoyed sandman being inm film, the effects on him were great especially when he became what he is.  i kinda didnt like how they changed ben parkers fate, but it still turned out to be good story telling that goes back to the original. i cant wait for spider-man 4 and hopefully all the cast and sam raimi will be back for it and possibly more after the news i heard on websites. can anyone let me know if theres gonna be a full-screen dvd release? thank you.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Ah, the Spartans. Brutal. Violent. Pederastic (they loved their boys, and often, depsite the movie which has them dissing on Athens for that particularity). They were manly men. Not men in tights. But manly men never the less.    \\"300\\" is not a movie about history. It takes in the past, sure, but only in the same way that something like [[ASIN:6305558167 Excalibur]] takes plce in the past. It's not a movie set in the real world, but rather set in a world full of exaggerations. It's about these highly exaggerated men, and their highly exaggerated enemies. It's not here to teach you about history, but rather to impress you and blow you away with mind-numbing visuals.    In that is succeeds wildly. Who can forget the grim spectre of the \\"tree\\" made from bodies? The wall made from bodies? Or, indeed, the large piles of bodies stacked everywhere?    Beyond that, though, there's also very poetic scenes, such as the site of the oracle writhing in her chamber, the shot of Xerxes arriving on his throne, or the look on the faces of the Persians as they fell down into the pit in Sparta?    The plot in the movie is simple. The diaglogue is workman-like, though with occasional nods to Herodotus. The acting is pretty damn fine (as are a few of the Spartans). The movie isn't great social commentary on East vs West (despite what the government of Iran might have you think).    This is a film about war, about violence and in many ways about beauty. Don't even try to think of it as anything else, and you'll enjoy it just fine.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|Longtime Rush fan here.  After months of listening to Snakes & Arrows and even hearing the new songs live in concert, I was convinced I didn't like much of the new album outside of the instrumentals.  However, this week I suddenly starting really HEARING the songs and my opinion has done a radical 180-degree turn.       From the date of release, I was very disappointed in the new album, as I was with Vapor Trails and Test for Echo.  I felt like the lyrics were lacking, the music too slow and plodding and the \\"wall of sound\\" guitars just muddy and uninspiring.  But something finally clicked for me this week and now I can't get enough of the new tracks.    What I think made this happen for me was reading an article from Modern Drummer where Neil was talking about how he constructed his drum parts.  As a drummer, I always enjoying reading about things like that and I decided to listen to each song as I read about how what he was doing on it.  Much to my surprise, what at first listen had seemed like very straightforward boring drumming suddenly came alive with nuance and energy.  I really started to notice the incredible control and subtle complexity Neil was displaying in each song.  And I hadn't heard all of his neatly constructed \\"tributes\\" to various other drummers like Tony Williams, John Bonham and Dave Weckl. As a drummer, this made things much more fun to listen to.     Once I started enjoying the drumming, the rest of the music just came rushing in.  The wall of layered guitars, while still more than I'm used to with Rush, was now more accessible and acoustically diverse.  Even the lyrics seemed more approachable and less harsh, even though I'm still not a fan of his new \\"me-centric\\" lyrics. I'm realizing that this may be Rush's most PERSONAL release in that it really feels like they put all of themselves into it.  From interviews, it seems that they are really enjoying playing the new songs live too.  And when I listen with that kind of \\"personal\\" ear, I findthis album a real joy.  It was humbling for me to realize that I might have just not been musically \\"mature\\" enough to really appreciate the album the first 50 times I heard it.      I do want to echo others' recommendations to listen to this on a good pair of headphones.  The layering and complexity of the music is lost on your average stereo and even on my good car stereo and just sounds muddy. I'm not normally a fan of listening at top volume, but I find this album sounds much better at higher volumes too - the harmonies and low-end really can shine then.    I'm only giving it 4 stars because I'm still a little disappointed in the overall mid-tempo rhythm of the album - I'd have liked a few more fast songs.  But I can see my score gradually increasing to 4.5 stars with time.     I'd be interested to hear if any other fans out there have had similar experiences.  If you're not a fan, but you're open-minded, give it another shot!
B00005JPFE|3.0|This was far and away my least favorite movie from Pixar -- it also was my three children's least favorite Pixar movie.  I'll admit that I had a little skepticism about how fun a movie about rat, kitchens and cooking would be.  In the end, it was not an issue for my kids (in terms of offending their sensibilities) and did not generally bother me -- although the occasions where thousands of rats swarmed the kitchen were pretty grotesque and unappealing.<br /><br />One of the hallmarks of most Pixar movies is their ability to entertain both adult and children alike.  The story lines and characters are simple enough in the way they operate at a base level for young kids , but provide enough \\"inside\\" jokes and cultural references to be thorougly enjoyable to an adult.  \\"Ratatouille\\" fell well short of delivering both of these aspects that made other Pixar films exceptional.  There were of course some great scenes -- Remy \\"teaching\\" Alfredo how to cook by moving tufts of his hair -- but overall the conceptual idea of a rat as a chef and the story and characters did not create a gastronomic delight for me.
0345494768|5.0|I guarantee that after you finish this book, you'll find out information you never knew about Star Wars, the making of the movie and the story.    I cant praise this book enough. It's the ULTIMATE piece of history for anyone who considers themselves a big Star Wars fan.    There's many pictures i have never seen elsewhere, lots of interviews with the people responsible for making this movie (Lucas himself, actors, producers etc etc) and you can see the evolution of the story, aswell as the birth of ILM and a vision that would change cinema forever.    The hardcover edition is well worth the extra cost, since it includes 48 pages of bonus material (like rare storyboards and Lucas' first recorded thoughts on the expanded universe).    My only wish now is that they give the same treatment and put out a similar book about Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.    Big thumbs up!
B00003CXAW|4.0|King Kong (Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, 1933)<br /><br />When I was a kid, I obsessed over monster movies. (Well, didn't we all?) I was eight when the 1976 remake of King Kong came out, and I saw it innumerable times on the Saturday afternoon creature feature over the years. But somehow, despite seeing clips from it thousands of times and having seen enough stills of it in monster-movies books and magazines when I was just a little squid, I somehow managed to never see the original version entire. I remedied that error last week. King Kong is one of those movies that constantly makes thousand-best lists (of all those I've compiled, only Jonathan Rosenbaum's leaves it off), but while I was watching it, I had to wonder: did it make the lists because of what it was in 1933, or because it holds up well today? Ideally, a truly classic film should be a mix of both (Murnau's Nosferatu: Eine Symphonie des Grauens is a perfect example; at the time, it was revolutionary, with Murnau inventing new ways to film tracking shots and the like, while it still packs a creepy punch almost a century later just because it's a damned good movie); while there's no doubt that King Kong was revolutionary for its time, and did a great deal to advance the wonderful world of movie special effects, it was made at a time when silent film was still a credible option, and the expressionism inherent in silent film hadn't quite cleared off yet. And when I look at it like that, I realize just how modern it was, for its time; so many of the players in this movie give perfectly creditable performances. But the one who seems like a holdover from the silent film days where her acting is concerned is incapable of being ignored-- the movie's star, Fay Wray. Now, I grant you, she's supposed to be playing someone who's acting in a silent film, so had she kept the overacting for when she was in front of Robert Armstrong's cameras, well, that would have been all well and good. But even while everyone around her is acting in a more modern fashion, Wray is all about the overacting. It tends to get annoying.<br /><br />That said, the movie is exceptionally well-made (especially given Cooper and Schoedsack's previous collaboration, the somewhat anemic The Most Dangerous Game, made on a basement budget using the sets and actors, for the most part, the two were using for King Kong); the script is well-plotted and well-paced, much of the acting is at or above par for the time (Wray has already been noted; Victor Wong, who portrays Charlie the cook, plays his role well, but is so hopelessly stereotyped we never get to see what he's really made of), and of course the special effects were marvelous for the time. It is certainly still a watchable movie, and an enjoyable one. And maybe that's enough. ****und her is acting in a more modern fashion, Wray is all about the overacting. It tends to get annoying.

B00005JODM|5.0|I really loved this movie.  I saw it 3 times in theaters.  It gets a little bit slow during the marching scene but thats the only part of the movie i get even a little bored with.  The songs are excellent and ive been singing them ever since and the cast is great.  John Travoltas voice got a bit annoying, i feel like he tried to do the Willy Wonka voice of Johnny depp and failed but he has his high points in the movie.  Dancing in a fat suit for one.
0385340559|4.0|This is the eleventh book in the series and we have earned a new insight into his prior life in the service.  We get to meet four of his old collegues from the 110th MP and the families of some of the others.  Jack has never been one to hang around or keep mementos or even phone numbers.  The only thing that Reacher has is his infinite fascination with numbers. So when someone wants to track him down they have to do it by depositing money into his bank account.<br /><br />Child starts the book by having the bad guys throw and old friend of Reacher's out of a helicopter at 3000 feet.  Not good.  No one bounces that well.  When Reacher gets an emergency message from on the \\"special investigators\\" he knows that it's not for a friendly reunion.  If one of his \\"old buddies\\" go to the trouble of sending him a message, it can only mean trouble.  But the trouble will be for the people who have \\"messed\\" with his friends.<br /><br />The story itself is well written and the plot is logical to a point and especially at the beginning it's hard to tell who are the bad guys and who are the badder guys.  But the story follows a linear flow that keeps it from getting overly convoluted and Child never tries anything 'sneaky' by throwing people in to fray as blind alleys.  The things that the group they does and the situations they are involved in don't seem to be super- human and one would expect trained military personnel to be able to do.<br /><br />So the only question that arises from this story is: after thirteen years in the military and ten years out, Reacher has to be in his mid 40s; how much longer can he continue to wander America, living off the Grid.
B000003S0Z|5.0|Before and After Science is perhaps Brian Eno's masterpiece (though I'm nowhere NEAR done listening to all his music that's available).  On this album, the songs are highly melodic and really shows you just how much talent Brian Eno had.  I think it would be really hard to deny the unbelievable amount of creativity his album features.  Brian Eno went out of his way to deliver as close to a masterpiece as a musician can possibly make.<br /><br />For some reason, \\"Backwater\\" is the one song that always immediately comes to mind when I come across this album on the internet.  I love that one the most.  I love the entire thing, and believe this is truly a spectacular collection of highly melodic pop songs.
B000002U82|2.0|This, along with \\"The Wall\\" is one of the Floyd's most overrated outings.  For whatever reason, most people (and people with good enough taste to listen to, and be fans of, the Floyd) pass over masterpieces like \\"Meddle\\", \\"More,\\" \\"Obscured By Clouds,\\" and \\"Animals\\" in favor of this work.      First of all, its strengths:  there are decent ideas, both musically and lyrically, here.  The recording itself, the production values, are particularly worthy of praise.  There is perhaps not another album that sounds like this one, although in the wake of remastering efforts, and super-audio, and what-have-you, I find that the bass parts (the bass guitar, and the lower pieces in Nick Mason's kit) sound a bit 'flat' or 'dull.'  The chord progressions are up to the Floyd's usual standards, as is the arranging.      However, chord progressions do not make a song -- songs require melodies, and there are none to be found here.  What's interesting is that Floyd had proved themselves eminently capable of melodic writing (witness the beginning part of \\"Echoes,\\" the end of \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\", \\"If,\\" or \\"Fat Old Sun\\").  They would return to writing real melody again in their subsequent album, \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"  It's almost as though on \\"Dark Side,\\" they decided to leave everything to production and the sound, as though sheer \\"atmosphere\\", intensity of instrumental color, and volume were enough.  It is an approach that almost works -- it is at its most effective in the instrumental portions of \\"Money,\\" \\"Time,\\" and \\"Any Colour You Like.\\"      For those of you who seem to think \\"Great Gig In the Sky\\" is melodic, I'll head that argument off here -- Great Gig consists of a simple two chord vamp (during the verse), over which Clare Torry improvises a line that does not repeat (melody requires repetition).  Nor is the bass line to \\"Money\\" a melody -- it is a quasi-melodic bass line.  Notice that Dave Gilmour's vocal part is largely a modified version of the bass line.      Lyrically, too, this one is less sophisticated than other Floyd albums.  Roger Waters himself has remarked that the lyric to \\"Money\\" now seems \\"so second form, I can't really believe I got away with it.\\"      This album, even when I first heard it, never exercised the hold over me that \\"Meddle,\\" or \\"Animals\\" did upon a first listen.  And it is still the album I am least likely to listen when I make my periodic returns to the Floyd catalogue.
B000000OQF|1.0|I hate Guns N' Roses and believe they never deserved all the popular success they've received through the years.  No offense to anyone who likes them, but many of their songs sound like slightly heavier and angrier rip-offs of old Aerosmith songs such as \\"Last Child\\".  In fact, this album is basically a heavier version of Rocks.      People keep telling me \\"Well, at least they were better and different compared to all those fake hair metal bands around at the time\\" but bands such as Twisted Sister and Ratt are seriously more appealing to me than these guys ever were.  Songs like \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and \\"Paradise City\\" are overplayed to the point of being totally boring and borderline annoying, and supposed underrated tracks such like \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" and \\"My Michelle\\" aren't any better either, in my opinion.      The band has no good guitar solos, riffs, or drum work either.  Everything about them is totally uninspiring.  A band that never deserved all the popularity they had (and unfortunately continue to have).  A very average band.
0385484518|5.0|I first read, \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" by Mitch Albom. The book was given to me as a college graduation gift from my sister. It was a really great story and easy read, so I decided to look for other books by Albom.    I enjoyed this story as well! I feel that Albom's stories keep me captivated and I like his style of writing. I ended up giving my copy of this book to another friend when he left for grad school. It makes a great gift and I will purchase another copy to keep in my book collection.

And then sinking into Jamiroquai's delicious funk, remembering old hits, now with a twist (these are different versions), is so cool. If you're a true fan, you just gotta have it. If you're new to Jamiroquai, this is also a great compilation, with the bonus of the remixed versions.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|The Music and Lyrics soundtrack is kind of a sleeper hit. The songs, mostly written by Fountains of Wayne bassist, Adam Schlesinger are unexpectedly refreshing and good for the most part.<br /><br />Pop Goes The Heart has the sound of 80s Wham while Way Back Into Love is a piece of contemporary pop. Two versions sung by Grant/Bennett and Grant/Barrymore exude different feelings. The latter sounds more emotionally connected whereas the former is a little more playful.<br /><br />Avant and Bloodshy contributes Buddha's Delight sung by the ditzy, Buddha-loving Cora who is unmistakably modelled after Britney Spears. Songs like Entering Bootytown and Slam have the typical seductive and hypnotic beat Spears is known for.<br /><br />The tearjerker must be the solo piano onstage performance of Don't Write Me Off by Grant. Dance with Me tonight is written by director Marc Lawrence's 13-year old son.<br /><br />The surprise here is that the trio Grant, Barrymore and Bennett sing with<br />adequacy and for the most part, they looked like they had fun.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Great album! Not a bad track on the disc.  For me the highlights are 'The Dark Eternal Night' and 'In the Presence of Enemies - Part II'.

The plot is a little slow at times but stick with it - the pace picks up.  Plus, the well developed characters keep it going.  I really enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B000002GYI|4.0|there is plenty of nice dreamy electronic music out there (brian eno, of course comes to mind), and much excellent techno type stuff (aphex twin, for example), and lots and lots of blips and bleeps and dissonant oriented sounds that mostly grate on the ears (i would refer you to the 3 disc compilation \\"OMH+ - the early gurus of electronic music\\" for a healthy dose of that sort of thing), but these fellas called Kraftwerk have done quite a trick here: they have made an album of electronic music that is pure catchy pop fun. melodic pop electronica. i like the genre. i like this music. good going guys.
B000002GXX|4.0|This is the album I cut my Eagles teeth on, and by force of habit I still think of it as the definitive Eagles album.  But it's also where they took a decidedly commercial turn, and on my first run through it in several years, I didn't find it nearly as enjoyable as some of their other work.    No question, though, that it has its moments.  The mellow rock of \\"Take It to the Limit\\" and \\"Lyin' Eyes\\" never gets stale no matter how many times I hear them on classic rock radio.  The beautiful \\"Hollywood Waltz\\" (which, as a country waltz, will never make it onto the radio!) rounds out the trio of five-star songs found here.  Most of the other songs are not bad:  \\"Too Many Hands\\" and \\"Visions\\" are characteristic Eagles rockers.  The well-known title track is nearly as good, though the not-quite-disco beat dates it a bit too much.  The instrumental \\"Journey of the Sorcerer\\" is a fitting last stand for original member Bernie Leadon, who took the last of the Eagles' country influence with him when he left.      Overall, it's just a slight step down from their two previous albums.  If you like the hits from here, you'll probably like at least some of the other songs as well.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|it has been many a year since i've enjoyed a new r & b artist. sometime around the early 90's the inspiration in the genre just seemed to stop. for the last decade or more the r & b scene has been stagnant waters rather than the deep soul waters that it once was. it somehow became a genre that was populated by cookie-cutter performers who thought that just hitting notes pitch perfect was what singing should be about (forget personality, forget creative inspiration). everybody sounded the same, sounded boring. thus, i was delighted that 2006 brought not one but two fresh sounding artists forth from the r & b world. first i found amy winehouse, then corinne bailey rae. what a surprise. r & b with actual personality. two artists with their own fresh sound. hooray! ms rae's disc is an outstanding production filled with her personable, beautiful voice juxtaposed with lush string arrangements and subtle acoustic guitar. great stuff. i hope 2006 will be the tip of an iceberg that brings up from the deep a new generation of artists like ms winehouse & ms rae to save the r & b genre from the dull path it had turned onto. yes, i hope that.
B000002GYN|4.0|As rumors abound of the first all-new Eagles album since 1979, I got to wondering if the original six albums by one of my favorite bands from high school are still as good as I remember them.  After listening to the debut album again, I am reminded that it wasn't among my favorites back then, but if anything, I appreciate it more now.    I have always heard Glen Frey and Don Henley were not very fond of this album, due to its being \\"too mellow.\\"  To my ear, though, it's only a bit more mellow than most of the other albums.  \\"Chug All Night,\\" \\"Tryin',\\" and \\"Nightingale\\" rock just as assuredly as anything else in their catalog, and they also lack the polish that rubbed a lot of critics the wrong way on some of their more famous songs.  \\"Take the Devil\\" also has its moments.      It is true that there are several mellower moments here as well, most notably \\"Train Leaves Here This Morning,\\" but that is true to varying degrees of all their albums.  If there is a fundamental difference from the later albums, it is that their brand of country-rock is heavier on the country than the rock here.  \\"Earlybird\\" is one of their most countrified tracks ever.  That one might be a bit much if you only like their last couple of albums, but fans of \\"Lyin' Eyes\\" and \\"Already Gone\\" will love it.  Last but not least, this set includes their first three hits, \\"Take it Easy,\\" \\"Witchy Woman,\\" and \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling.\\" I don't address these only because odds are you've heard them all on the radio hundreds of times.  They do fit in well with the less famous songs here.    Not a bad first effort at all.
1594200823|5.0|Who could have thought tracing the contents of four meals could educate one so much. Layer upon layer is uncovered like a great detective story.   I would say this is the kind of book that warrents being read and discussed in schools and the home.   We see the workings of men's minds and the effect on the world.

B000002GYW|5.0|Desperado has always been my favorite Eagles album.  Hotel California is probably a better batch of songs, but they don't fit together as well as the ones found here do.  That, along with the relatively uncommercial Old West motif, is probably why this was their only album with no hit singles.  All the songs just sound more convincing if listened to in one sitting.    Admittedly, the opener, \\"Doolin' Dalton,\\" isn't much like anything else they ever did, but the edgy harmonies are great and it does set the stage for the loosely bound tale that follows.  \\"Out of Control\\" is the most savage rocker of their career and the very epitome of the wild-guys'-night-out motif that appears throughout their catalog, although the bland guitar solo shows why it's a good thing they hired Don Felder on their next album.  Other heavy moments include \\"Certain Kind of Fool\\" and \\"Outlaw Man,\\" which could be about the same small town misfit running amok in the desert.  Although the Eagles reportedly wanted to prove they were a rock and roll band with Desperado, it also features two of their best ballads.  You probably know the title track even if you don't own this album, but \\"Saturday Night\\" is a lovely buried treasure that deserves to be just as well known.  Also featured here is the mid-tempo \\"Tequila Sunrise,\\" which should have been the album's hit single.    The country motif all but disappeared from the Eagles sound after this - but at least they really made it count once.
B00005JP5R|3.0|In the year 2057, the sun is dying. It doesn't shine as it used to do anymore, and humans are facing extinction. To reignite the dying sun with nuclear weapons, a spaceship Icarus II and eight specialists are sent from the earth - they are Rose Byrne, Cliff Curtis, Chris Evans, Troy Garity, Cillian Murphy, Hiroyuki Sanada, Benedict Wong and Michelle Yeoh,    \\"Sunshine\\" written by Alex Garland and directed by Danny Boyle starts with this smart premise. Our last hope of survival depends on the chance of getting the earth hotter, precisely the opposite thing most of us want it to happen. The film benefits from the photography cleverly using the contrast of light and shadow (thanks to photographer Alwin Küchler (\\"Morvern Callar\\"). The red-burning sun at close range looks really deadly, and so is the heat.     Danny Boyle, as the film goes on, makes it clear that he is more interested in the psychological aspects of the film than the purely scientific ones. That does not mean the film is not convincing as sci-fi film and certainly the spaceship's design (with unique shape to protect the heat from the sun) and several discussions exchanged between the astronauts look and sound authentic.     But some part really needs more carefully detailed storytelling. I mean, on the way to the sun the ship's crew encounter some thing(s) which I rather not disclose here; which, I am afraid, is not a very original idea. Several events occur, which these experts who are supposed to be trained hard fail to handle rightly. Yes, I know, the claustrophobic atmosphere and highly stressful work at hand can explain, but things are sometimes incredible. And as to the final 30 minutes of the film, sorry if you like the film, but I started to lose interest in the confusing wrap-up.    Or maybe I am complaining too much and Danny Boyle is just trying to show us his own vision of what certain professional people would do under this heavy responsibility and critical situation. (Even so, I must say,most of the wonderful multi-national actors are wasted, especially Byrne, Sanada and Yeoh.) To me, the film looked like a somber version of \\"Armageddon\\" equally entertaining and equally flawed, but not in the same way.
B000002GVO|4.0|You can argue that \\"Hotel California\\" is overexposed.  But love it or hate it, it has all the essentials of a great rock song: interesting and quotable lyrics, guitar work even the snobs can appreciate, radio-friendly hooks, and the distinction of having inspired an urban legend.  (No, there is nothing occult-related in the song.  Its true subject, the decadence of Southern California in the late 1970s, is frightening enough as it is.)  It's one of the great songs of its era.    And the rest of the Eagles' biggest album?  With such a terrific opening track, there's not a lot else this set needs to prove, in any case.  But there are other strong points.  The closing track, \\"The Last Resort,\\" features some of their most thoughtful lyrics ever.  (For all their neverending battles to prove they were a rock group, the fact is that the Eagles had a knack for ballads.)  \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" is thematically similar to the title track, but much more straightforward in its tale of self-abuse.  New member Joe Walsh shines on guitar on that one (and I say that as someone who is not a big fan of his solo work).  Walsh's vocal turn on \\"Pretty Maids All In a Row\\" is a nice surprise as well.    The remainder of the album is a bit thin, especially compared to the brilliance of the first and last songs.  But so what?  As a look at the very unique time and place they were living in, it's held up quite well overall.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is one of the most beautiful filmed nature documentaries ever, in my opinion. The colors are so vivid and rich with stunning panoramas and gorgeous vistas. The animals were filmed in their natural habitat hunting prey and mating rituals and sometimes just playing, wolf puppies are so beautiful. This is DVD set is a treat for anybody who loves nature. This series was filmed in HD and then scaled down to standard resolution, if you have an upconvert DVD player it looks as close to HD as you can get. Definitely a must have, 5 stars. This tree hugger loves this DVD set.

B00005JPMZ|4.0|I'll admit that in the early 90's I was a massive Turtles fan. From blankets to this weird mirror to the abundance of toys and even a homemade costume for Halloween, I was quite the diehard. Of course now I grew out of it but still, I just had to check out the film. That's tricky since do you like the film because you were a fan, like the film because it's good or hate it. Well it does have its issues, the film is quite good whether or not you were a nut in the heyday.    Taking place after the defeat of Shredder, the 4 have parted ways. Leonardo is in Central America training to be a better leader, Michaelangelo entertains kids at birthdays as Cowabunga Carl, Donatello is an IT tech serviceman while Raphael takes on the persona of the Nightwatcher to help the people of New York. Meanwhile, April is now an archaelogist working for a powerful businessman named Max Winters and in a relationship with Casey Jones.    However, 3000 years earlier, someone opened a portal and became immortal and unleashed 13 monsters unto the Earth with his generals being turned to stone. Now with the help of his generals as well as the Foot Clan led by Karai, his plans could end up doing heavy damage around the world so it's up to the Turtles to stop him but with the Turtles at odds with each other, how can they save the world when they can't get along?    That's basically the story in a nutshell and it might sound complicated but trust me when I say it isn't. In fact, it's probably a bit too simplistic for some people but considering this is a comic book franchise, it doesn't have to be complex. But like a lot of stories, characters can get sidetracked (Michaelangelo and Donatello feel more like supporting characters than part of the group) and some such as Karai don't get much development or screen time at all. But at least it adds more to the other 2 Turtles as well and there's one scene many will feel is a long time coming.    As for voices, nobody really sort of steals the show sincethey're all good in their roles. As for Mako voicing Splinter, I don't really have an issue with his voice although it's more accent-y than I'd like but maybe I just saw the originals too many times but I loved Splinter's more wiser and older voice from the movies like a grandfather whereas here he sounds like an affectionate uncle. Animation though is superb and while some might chuckle at character designs (why are humans so scrawny looking?), the detail and the scope of it kind of makes up for it. As for the humor, it's mainly Mikey that provides it and at times it feels like we're still in the 90's. Burps, puns and surfer lingo were fine then but considering the more darker look of the film, having a California-sounding guy everywhere doing lowbrow humor might detract some.    It's a fair bet to say that there's no doubt a special edition to come since deleted scenes have commentary only and featurettes are minimal at best. Either look for a fully decked-out set one day or an extended edition with more darker, character stuff but if you or your kids have been into Turtles either in the 90's or now, than it's a fine watch that doesn't need nostalgia to make one enjoy it.

They're simply trying to justify their actions.  Me, I thought the experience in the theater was pretty much on target with the director's intent.  I thought Planet Terror was much better than Death Proof, only because it started out at a faster pace.  I'm not looking for plot or story arcs in a movie with missing reels, so just lay it on me.  However, that's what I got in Death Proof, as it's been said before, a lot of women yakking about nothing in particular for most of the movie was pretty much an indication that the experience itself was winding down.  I, for one, am glad that they are releasing them seperately only because I don't want the second half, Death Proof, and as such, I don't want to pay for it.  I'm sure if they release them on a four-disc package (since both undoubtly will have two discs) then they are going to charge out the Wazoo.  Death Proof sucked and so I don't have any desire to fork over approximately $20.  Just put the trailers on both discs and I'll be happy.
B000RJO578|2.0|I had high hopes for this one given the glowing reviews everywhere for it, but it suffers from the same problem as Club Dread: it became the very thing it was spoofing. The first half or so of this movie is great. It's hilarious and spoofs so many police and action movies and TV shows that it's a good test for a movie nerd. But when its own story began to take the lead, the gruesome death scenes and tired shootouts, while not without comic nods, were virtually indistinguishable from what the first half lampooned. It devolved so much, my wife and I turned it off with 10 minutes left.
B00004RFFS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is an accurate interpretation of the book to say the least. All of actors did a wonderful job interpreting the characters.
B000ROALE4|4.0|Definitely Slayer's best album since Seasons in the Abyss. In my opinion, the previous few albums were, for the most part, crap. Presumably Lombardo's return played a big part in making this album a success. As a Catholic, I find much of the subject matter here offensive and misleading-- but, then again, I never listened to Slayer to \\"learn\\" anything. Their anti-religion, pro-Satan stances are tiresome and affected. Fortunately, I can think for myself, so as far as I am concerned they can continue with this \\"schtick\\" as long as they continue to make good music.
B000OY8NII|5.0|Excellent series, surprising and entertaining.  The characters are great. Sci Fi Channels best show on TV.

0143034901|5.0|Zafon's novel is one of the most enjoyable books that I have read.  Every word in the book is well placed, and every page contains drama that propels you to move further in the book.  This is the first book that has made me refuse sleep to continue reading it at night.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Being a \\"Browncoat\\" for a good few years now i've obviously collected some great Firefly/Serenity based items and the dvds is one of them.    The original Region 1 was released almost 2 years ago now (December 05 i'm sure) and while i did watch it to death, special features and all, there was definetly a lack of special features for what was such a great and fan-loved movie. Then the Region 4 release came out packed with an extra disc and contained some of what are included in this release: The Extended Scenes, Take A Walk on Serenity, A Filmmaker's Journey and The Green Clan, but the Region 4 also included a Joss Whedon Q+A which was close to over an hour long. It didn't really add any new info to anyone steeped in the 'verse, but seeing Joss Whedon playing off an audience when you haven't in the flesh is a worthwhile special feature.    So is this the definitive release? not quite, though almost, the Cast & Joss commentary will no doubt be the best special feature of the lot and having the River Tam Sessions finally in high quality dvd as well as the Sci-fi special make this a MUST buy, as in now, but personally i'd still love to see the Sydney Q+A on there too.    If you don't yet own Serenity on dvd, buy this version but if you're really needing that Q+A, seek out the R4 as well, you need at least two copies of the dvd anyway, you don't want to hide the fact that you're a \\"Browncoat\\" do you?
B00005JPMZ|3.0|Leonardo (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) has been studying in South America.  He's been sent there by Master Splinter (Mako) to learn how to be a better leader to his brothers.  The training didn't go well, and Leo stayed.<br /><br />But in his absence, his brothers have lost their way.  Michelangelo (Mikey Kelly) dons a costume and hires himself out for entertainment as kid's birthday parties.  Donatello (Mitchelle Witfield) works as a computer helpline operator.  Only Raphael (Nolan North) still fights crime, taking to the streets at night as a vigilante.<br /><br />The turtle's human friend April (Sarah Michelle Gellar) finds Leo while on an antiques expedition.  When she tells him what his brothers are up to, he decides to return to New York, where he is greeted warmly by all but Raphael.<br /><br />He's returned just in time, however.  Something evil is happening in New York City.  Weird creatures are on the loose and even stranger creatures are capturing them.  Can the turtles pull together to find the answers and defend their city?<br /><br />I wasn't a fan of the turtles going into the movie, but got talked into going to see it by some friends.  Even so, I found this movie fairly predictable.  Now that's not necessarily a bad thing in my book.  There are some movies I absolutely love that were predictable.<br /><br />My bigger problem came with Leo and Raphael's fight.  I wanted to see the turtles working together, something they really don't spend much time doing.  In fact, this storyline dominates so much of the film, the villain's story seemed more like a badly tacked on sub-plot instead of the main focus.<br /><br />Not that the villain wasn't entertaining.  I got caught up in wondering how the turtles would defeat him.  I just wish it had been more prominently featured.<br /><br />The computer animation is quite interesting.  It's part realistic, part comic book.  There were shots that looked very real, including some during a rain storm.  Other times, it looked like something directly out of a comic book.<br /><br />I don't know how true fans will feel about the movie.  I tried to give it a far chance, but it really didn't entertain me like I hoped it would.I don't know how true fans will feel about the movie.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|When I was watching American Idol.  Kelly Clarkson was introduced as one of the featured artist for the finally show. She sang a song that caught my attention.  Never Again. Wow, the emotion she put into it and voice styling were great.  I purchased the CD and was pleased with the rest of the songs.  Although, Never Again is my favorite.
0525948023|5.0|In my opinion this book is even better than Eckhart's first book 'The Power of Now'. I just cannot praise this book too highly.   For many years I have been reading self-help books in order to understand why I and others do what we do and why it does not always work out the way we intended. Some of these books have been helpful, but they were not ones I wished to read again and again like this book 'A New Earth'.   I just cannot put this book down and each time I gain new insights into my own life and that of others too. I now operate on an entirely different wavelength than I used to. I am calmer in that I let go of 'stuff' that I would take the 'bait' for previously.   I can now see that the connection between the humans, the earth and the universe and where we all fit in with God. This is powerful writing that can only have been inspired from a spirituality source and not man's mind.   I do not consider myself a 'religious freak', but merely someone who wants to make sense of his life; this book, like no others is so powerfully written that it is life changing.   Do read this book, because if humanity is to survive it needs humans to re-assess their lives and become awakened and at the same time live a more satisfying life. Everyone gains!
0385720920|5.0|He never, ever disappoints the reader. This is the third or fourth book I've read by chuck and I drooled over every page like a dog does for a bone, the same way I did with his other works I've read. How anyone can call this drivel or not like it, is beyond me. It's Chuck Palahniuk, you know what you're going to get before you even open the book. He's an artist with words and paints a picture that always portrays the characters most intimate thoughts and actions.  And what's funny is most of the time it's the same intimate feelings we have, but we're just conditioned to keep to ourselves!
6305546797|5.0|You've heard it all before: a mute, faceless maniac stalking sexy teenage girls. The reason you've heard it all before is John Carpenter's Halloween, the 1978 slasher flick that launched a new sub-genre of horror -- one that quickly grew to define it.<br /><br />Most of Halloween's progeny -- the Friday the 13th series leading the queue -- stick rigidly to Carpenter's template. A young boy undergoes trauma and 15 (or so) years later hacks at frolicking nymphos. No doubt, this quickly grew stale, and fans of the genre became interested simply in quantity of gore and creative maiming.<br /><br />Unlike its imitators, however, Halloween still feels surprisingly fresh and suspenseful, thanks to Carpenter's cinematic panache. Carpenter lingers where most slasher autuers hurry to the next massacre. In fact, Halloween goes nearly an hour before heroine Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) or any of her friends are in danger.<br /><br />Carpenter -- whose flair for gruesome terror must disturb his loved ones -- allows his maniac time and space, attributing odd intent to his otherwise random violence. Escaped mental patient Michael Myers, although masked and silent, stalks his prey deliberately and with restraint, as if the carnage must be just so. This gives Curtis time to build a strong character. Laurie is a shy, intelligent teen and chronic babysitter whose libidinous friends magnify her social dislocation.<br /><br />Carpenter chooses his shots carefully and transforms otherwise prosaic scenes into something lyrical. The way Laurie's hair blows as she walks down empty autumn streets, or the way Michael steps back to study a freshly made corpse - just the idea that this ordinary slasher fare is worth mentioning in detail is rare indeed, and a testament to the very quiet, unassuming talent of John Carpenter. After all, he only wants to scare the pants off you.<br /><br />Also starring the ever-spritely P.J. Soles, and creepy Donald Pleasence as the psychiatrist most familiar with Myers' particular expression of evil, this limited edition two-disc set (only 30,000 numbered copies are in print) is terrific, starting with the incredible 2.35:1 widescreen transfer (pan-and-scan is also available).

0743554450|5.0|The Kite Runner was an education to an American who was ignorant of the wonderful people of Afghanistan and A Thousand Splendid Suns, even more.  For those of you who are also ignorant of the wonderful people who live there and the disparity they have suffered because of a government that does not care, this is a must read.  These two wonderfully written books are for those who do not fully understand what has happened in our world in the past decade and also for those who do.  They not only teach, but they bring out the compasion and respect for the people who are living in the country of Afghanistan.  Hats off to Khaled Hosseini for teaching THIS American respect for ALL people in this world and shame for the governments who opress them. I am looking forward with much anticipation to the next phase in my education!
B00005JKJA|5.0|This was the first David Lynch film I had ever seen. I was hesitant at first because after watching it I was like what the heck did I just watch but with some help I found an explanation of the events of the film that seemed to make the most sense to me. David Lynch's work is frustrating at first but if you are looking for a thinking movie and a freaky movie, then look into this one.     In addition, look into [[ASIN:B000060MWU Lost Highway]] as well but I don't recommend buying the \\"USA\\" version (it's a Canadian manufactured import) currently as it is not the quality befitting of Lynch's greatness. Unfortunately, there are apparently other \\"good\\" versions out there but they are not made for Region 1 DVD players. Who knows if it will ever get an official United States release (it's ten years old now) but for now, rent it, enjoy it, but don't buy the Canadian import version.
B000001C6M|5.0|Although a bit old, this album is still a great piece of Thrash Metal. \\"Reign in Blood\\" is more famous, but \\"Show no Mercy\\" contains a lot of very good guitar solos. It is not as violent as subsequent albums and the music is thus given a place of choice. This one is by far my favorite Slayer album.
0441009425|4.0|Reynolds creates a wonderful universe in Revelation Space. It's a great book (as the whole series is) to get lost in. It's not easy to create such depth to the universe, but Reynolds has done so... he ought to have considering the word count of the bloody thing. So yes, it's a great book to get lost in.<br /><br />However, the dialogue between characters is quite ridiculous and lengthy at times. Many, if not all, the characters were unlikable, which I enjoy a great deal. Creating characters which are easy to like to just an easy task to perform. But hating many aspects of lead and supporting characters takes dedication, to which Reynolds succeeds. Kudos to Reynolds for either his word usage or giant thesaurus, but as a crossword puzzle aficionado, his word usage stimulated me.<br /><br />His plot jumping leaves one on ones heels quite often, awaiting for the story to story to the point at which it left. There are numerous cliffhangers throughout the book with mysteries that the reader can try to solve before the answers are revealed... and most the time I thought I had the answers nailed down but Reynolds always kept me on my toes and forced me to review my aspect on the scenarios. The entire plot has a significant amount of troughs and crests... like a wave function.
B000ROALCG|3.0|I think it's been said. Marc tried to sing like Hector because the movie is about Hector. Marc does a good job but i've heard Hector do it and he owns these songs. So I give it a 3 because Marc is better than I expected him to be and any CD which introduces younger listeners to the joy of Hector's music has got to be a good thing.    I want to make another point Hector was a sonero, Marc isn't. There is a big difference between what singers were doing in the 70's and how they are singing now and this is largely because salsa music has changed so much. Marc is the best and biggest of the current R&B-fied generation of salsa singers and is perfect for the modern salsa but he could never have sung the complex improvisations of Hector. I thought i'd mention that because someone mentioned how Marc is a better singer because he has more range. Singing is more than range, it's also about projecting your emotion, and in the 70's it was also about being believable when singing about the barrio (poverty, love, joy, displacement, etc), as well as being able to improvise - the art of the sonero. Who are we kidding, Marc could never sound convincing on anything other than love (good or bad) and he certainly can't improvise.    70's salsa was full of improvisations for all members of the band which is why you hear so many piano, trumpet, trombone, conga, singing solos. You just don't get that in modern salsa, it's very formulaic. So as much as I like what Marc does and his music (in fact he got me into salsa, i'm 31), he ain't Hector.    In saying that, Marc does a great acting job as Hector. Man I was surprised. Watch the movie, not perfect, but good nevertheless.
B000LC3ID8|5.0|The third entry in the series is better than the last one, and almost  comparable to the first one.  The first one is so original and smart that it is almost unbeatable.  Here in part three, the traps are equally horrifying. But one thing is new to all the series is there is a strong philosophical theme about revenge - is revenge a good choice?  Really would like to see future episodes to come, cannot wait!!
0385486804|5.0|Honestly, I chose to read this book after I saw previews for the movie.  I was glad when I got it to see it was a short book as I was reading it for more informtion about the story as it sounded \\"interesting\\".  I was not prepared at all for this emotionally gripping story.  It haunts me.  All I can say is I know the film will not be anything as amazing as this book.  Jon did this incredible job of bringing Chris's spirit alive throughout all the pages.  His own accounts and experiences along with the passages from the books Chris loved, make this very personal and touching.  I can't wait to read Into Thin Air!
B00008OLYN|5.0|This cd is an amazing accomplishment from a very diverse band. First off I own all Opeths cd's. They are the reason i even started to listen to Growling vocals, but when you listen to thier composistions you'll understand. I am not a big fan of growling, but I am a fan of \\"Excellent\\" musicians and what this group has done with this particular cd is nothing short of a \\"Masterpiece\\" I will not repeat what the other 200 plus reviewrs said, just that this is a \\"MUST HAVE\\" in anyone into the 70's progressive music era, and anyone who respects good music. Opeth have don it again....I love this band!
0553588486|1.0|Save yourself time and money and look to the 1 star reviews for a more accurate viewpoint. I wish I had done this. Instead- reeled in by the many positive reviews- I bought this book, and had to read all dead 800 pages of it. The book is written well enough at first to keep you read, hoping it will get better...but it never does. You are left at the end feeling frustrated....and if you absolutely *need* to finish a series to the bloody end...well, you are stuck with 4 books, about 800 pages each. There are too many plots, and none of them interesting enough by itself....maybe Martin felt he had to switch back and forth to keep his readers entertained, instead of writing one, good solid plot. But I will not bash the author.....I suggest if you really want to find out, go to the bookstore and read a few pages of it. Don't read the excerpts....you really need to read it from the beginning, in concecutive order to know what you're getting into. I would definitely say Tad Williams Dragonbone Chair, Weiss & Hickman's Dragonlance series, the first 5 books of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, Anne Bishop's Blood Trilogy, Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel series, or Storm Constantine's books are much, much better than Martin's. Granted Martin has a lot of explicit sex scenes....unlike some reviewers, I have a strong stomach, but do you really want to read these scenes when they have NO style? Read Storm Constantine for something more interesting, different and intriguing!!

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers who described \\"My So-called Life\\" to be a realistic portrayal of teenage life in the early 1990's. The program premiered when I was a sophomore in high school, and I could completely relate to the character of Angela Chase, who was portrayed so poignantly by Claire Danes. Angela was the quintessential teenage girl, and I remember watching the show and reciting Angela's lines along with her, even though I'd never seen the episodes before. Everything about the show was incredibly realistic by television's standards, and Angela's problems were so similar to the issues other young girls deal with: relating with parents, fighting with siblings, having secret crushes and offbeat friends. Back in high school, I dyed my hair red just like Angela...I even related to her character's clothes: I was all about flannel shirts back in those days! (I don't think I said \\"like\\" as much as Angela did, though, but most teens used to talk that way, and still do!) When the show was canceled after only 19 episodes, I was devastated. To this day, I do not understand why more viewers didn't tune in to watch this amazing program.<br /><br />Anyway, I am so excited that \\"My So-Called Life\\" is being re-released on DVD. The first DVD set was ridiculously expensive and was discontinued after a very short time. This new set is much more affordable at just under $50, and it also contains numerous bonus features, including an interview with Claire Danes. The DVD set also comes with a collectible booklet that contains full-color photos and production notes about the show.<br /><br />I can't wait to own a copy of this amazing series, and I hope that a new generation of teenage girls discovers all that \\"My So-Called Life\\" has to offer.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|Definitely one of the smartest and best thriller in history.  This movie proves that a good story and good script is far more important  than a good budget (only $1 million).  All the suspense, gruesome, witty elements are in the highest standard in  movie standard.  Truly a must for not-so-easily-fainted.
B00005JPCF|2.0|I'm not one who usually gets excited about cartoons.  I mean, lately with the birth of my daughter around the corner I've been watching quite a bit more of them, but in general they are not my thing.  `Happy Feet' though was one I was determined to see.  You see, I adore the little creatures known as penguins and a cartoon devoted to them just seemed to be almost heaven sent.  I rushed to watch it, given all the praise and rave reviews, and have to say that after watching it through I was thoroughly disappointed.  Yes, I said disappointed.  In actuality I'm floored that it received all the rave reviews, and while I'll stand by the fact that it is indeed a better cartoon than that tripe known as `Cars' I still can't believe this mess won the Oscar.<br /><br />The storyline is a bit of a bore.  The whole `heartsong' aspect of this film kind of left me with this overly cheesy `I can believe I'm watching this' kind of feeling.  You see penguins love to sing.  That's how they find their soul mates.  They find their `heartsong' and thus find their mate.  The problem with little Mumble is that he can't sing.  He's practically tone-deaf and this has made him the outcast.  But he's not without his talent.  He can dance, but no one else seems to care much for that.  In fact the other penguins resent him for his talent and ultimately blame him for their lack of food.  So he's banished from the colony.  His banishment was the best thing for him though for he meets up with some Spanish penguins who embrace his ability to dance and help him change the world in effect bringing back all the fish.<br /><br />If I said anymore I'd give away too much so I'll stop there.<br /><br />So, while the plot is a bit on the `meh' side, there is more to hate in regards to this film.  First off the singing is ridiculous.  Instead of all new original songs (whatever happened to the good ol' days when animators and storyboard creators actually invested some originality in their work) we have a bunch of penguins running around singing songs we hear on the radio with lyrics changed slightly.  What makes it worse is that some of the songs are heavy on the sexual innuendos and are really inappropriate for children.  The voice over work is decent, but is it just me or is Nicole Kidman a little too breathy and somewhat annoying?  Personally, I don't feel she fit very well.<br /><br />In fact, the only really `good' thing about this movie was the incredibly talented Robin Williams who is just brilliant in this kind of work.  I've said this before, but I'll say it again.  I think it should be mandatory that every cartoon have at least one character voiced by Robin Williams.  The great thing about `Happy Feet' is that they give him TWO characters, and both of them are equally hilarious and memorable.  In fact I'm really upset that the remainder of the film is such a dud because both of Williams' characters are two of the funniest cartoon characters in recent memory.  I wish they would have given his characters a different movie to inhabit.  Alas, maybe they'll give him his own spin off.<br /><br />So anyways, I don't really think I have much more to say.  The film ends up getting way too political for its own good, and the ending is such a waste it's almost hard to watch.  I really wanted to like this, I really did, and I expected to love it, but I can't lie to myself.  `Happy Feet' truly is a bore of a film, a missed opportunity, which saddens me for it could have been so much better.round singing songs we hear on the radio with lyrics changed slightly.

B000OQF6N6|5.0|Quote off of Billboard.com \\"SMASHING TIME: A seven-year absence from Modern Rock Tracks has apparently made the hearts of Smashing Pumpkins fans grow fonder. The self-imposed hiatus hasn't hurt the group's chart fortunes, as \\"Tarantula\\" (Reprise) soars 30-5, to become the 17th consecutive top 10 hit for the band (and sixth consecutive top five hit).    The Pumpkins already held the record for the most consecutive top 10 hits in Modern Rock history, so this smashing return simply extends their lead.\\"    Enter Zeitgeist...    From the beginning pulsing drum beat of Doomsday Clock to the soft closing of Pomp and Circumstances this album puts Smashing Pumkins firmly back in the sonic conscience. The fact that Corgan did all the singing makes the harmonies used blend seemlessly with each other. In fact, everything but the drums is played or performed by Billy Corgan. Besides Dave Grohl (who is good but I don't believe as good as a total musician) I have never heard someone playing so much on album and have it sound so good. Jimmy Chamberlin lends his always awesome thunder and trademark snare to Corgan's guitars.    Rating each song individually (for those iTunes downloaders)    Remember this is just my opinion and many people will feel differently or disagree.    Doomsday Clock: Great Rock, pounding drums. 4 out of 5 stars.  7 Shades of Black: Reminiscant of earlier guitar driven SP (Geek USA). 3 out of 5 stars.  Bleeding The Orchid: An ode to the bands of the 90's. 5 out of 5 stars.  That's the Way (My Love Is): Almost poppy sounding (ZWAN?), but actually my favorite song on the CD. 5 out of 5 stars.  Tarantula: Kick the door in face melter rock. 5 out of 5 stars.  Starz: Great blend of crunch and solo guitars. 5 out of 5 stars.  United States: Like getting hit in the head with a new national anthem. 5 out of 5 stars.  Neverlost: Harpiscord and guitars? It works mostly... 3 out of 5 stars.  Death From Above (from Best Buy you get this song at #9): My favorite of the bonus track choices (the others being Zeitgeist or Stellar). Almost early 80's sounding to me, but in a good way. 4 out of 5 stars.  Bring The Light: Building song with great overdub guitars! 5 out of 5 stars.  Come On (Let's Go): A Smashing rift (definitely a signature one) Good sounding vocals. 5 out of 5 stars.  For God and Country: Almost like a return to Adore. Lyrics are strange. Only weird one for me. 2 out of 5 stars.  Pomp and Circumstances: Could have been a Mellon Collie song. A good softer end to the album. 4 out of 5 stars.    Well, feel free to disagree, but this is one person's opinion. I think lot's of people would love this album given the chance. I strongly recommend listening through headphones as you can hear all the arrangements and separation better.    Have fun with the \\"Spirit of the Times\\"!    P.S. Download Zeitgeist and Stellar if you just have to have all the songs. I enjoyed the acoustic Zeitgeist the most.
B000QXDED6|1.0|This movie has no meaning.  Throughout the movie I had a hard time understanding why they chose to fight.  And it seems that it is over arrogance.  This movie holds extremely horrible values.  The movie just shows how 300 stupid men chose to commit suicide over arrogant values.  So they say it is Spartan law, never surrender, never retreat.  So let's just die for pride and kill as many people as possible before we die.  This movie further escalates the violence of this society.      This movie is nothing compared to Gladiator.  Although it tries so much to imitate Gladiator, it fails completely.  The movie just glorifies the violence that was contained in the movie gladiator, such as the scene of the head being chopped off and it just figures that it would gain the audience base for just having many gruesome scenes of heads being decapitated.  But what they forgot is to make a meaningful movie the way Gladiator did.      The movie is like playing a violent video game; it is just seeing a bunch of people killing each other for absolutely no reason.  The movie shows how stupid people can be to choose war over love, to leave their wives and children at home in order to fight for pride, to never show love b/c that equals weakness, to enter into war prancing around without a shirt and forget to protect yourself with armor, to leave 300 abandoned families b/c of your competitive ego.  The movie shows how stupid people can waste their lives away, living for violence.  These 300 stupid \\"Spartans!\\" represent the gang members of modern society who kill people b/c of competition, greed, money, women, jealousy, etc.  Movies like this should be banned from society; movies like this teach our children and adults who cannot think for themselves to feel comfortable killing and hurting people for unjustifiable reasons.      Luckily I borrowed this movie and did not have to waste my money on this garbage.  Shame on the people who created this movie for not caring about the society and how violent it is at the moment.  Shame on them for contributing to the senseless violence of this world, and for educating our children and adults to kill over senseless reasons.  Shame on them for only thinking about themselves and how much money they are going to make over the lives that are lost in this world

B00003CXSP|3.0|I was pleasantly surprised by Ridley Scott's \\"Hannibal\\" given that the movie is based on the horrible book which I more than dislike. I see a writer as a God - he creates by the power of his imagination the new worlds and populates them with his creatures. Once, he created the world, he should give his characters free will; they should act by the logic of their personalities not by their creator's sheer caprice. What Harris did in \\"Hannibal\\" is unspeakable - he just showed his fans how much he despised them. Actually, he did two things wrong - the ending and his attempt to explain Hannibal, to look behind the mask. The film comparing to the book has several redeeming values: visually, it is a stunning work of a great director. I am yet to see Florence, the celebrated City of Flowers as dark, dangerous, and anti-tourist as in \\"Hannibal\\". Second, the movie did not try to \\"explain\\" Hannibal, to get inside his head and understand him. Harris attempted in the book to give us the reasons why Hannibal was what he was - it was weak and laughable. If he chose to present Hannibal as some sort of supernatural creature with almost animals' instincts, he should've left him as an eternal mystery. The best description of Hannibal belongs to Clarice. When asked, \\"Is it true what they're sayin', he's some kinda vampire?\\" - she replied, \\"They don't have a name for what he is\\". And finally, the film avoided the literally vomit-inducing, absurd, irrational, obnoxious slap in face book's ending - for this alone I think \\"Hannibal\\" is a very decent movie and a lot of fun.<br /><br />3.5/5

B000OV170W|5.0|I've read this book several times, and have led the discussion of the book at the two book clubs I belong to.  There is SO much to discuss. If you don't belong to a reading group, you will be begging your friends to read \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" so you have someone to discuss it with.    The book is so engaging, it's difficult to put it down.  What will happen next?  There are a number of sub plots, as well, and they are equally engaging.      What would YOU do if you were the main character?   The Mother?   The Dad?  Well-drawn characters keep the plot moving.  DO read this book, and when you finish, you will want to read more books by Jodi Picoult!

B000078DOH|2.0|Over the years, I have risen to the rank of Captain in the Red Hot Chili Peppers Hate Brigade. In college, during the salad days of Mother's Milk and BloodSugarSexMagik, I liked them OK but only because you couldn't go to a frat party without hearing at least one of their tunes during the course of a drunken night. Girls in particular dug them, so I kinda had to start liking them if I hoped to have even a prayer of getting them to take me seriously.<br /><br />Of course, after the success of BloodSugarSexMagik they descended into complete ridiculousness and my lone album I owned (Mother's Milk) disappeared someplace, and I never felt the need to replace it.<br /><br />That's how I judge a band -- if I lost their tape, did I feel the need to replace it with a CD? Prince: yes. Van Halen: yes. Elvis Costello: yes.  Red Hot Chili Peppers: no.<br /><br />I did hear that Freaky Styley is the one Chili Peppers album worth owning, because of the great George Clinton's involvement as producer. While the album is OK, a sense of \\"white boys trying to act black\\" is sadly ever-present, even with Clinton's still-active sensibilities stamped all over the record.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Clinton couldn't do anything new with the Chili Peppers, and the Peppers couldn't inspire Clinton to go other places he hadn't already gone with Parliament. But I can conclude this is easily their best album (which is like saying Murmur is R.E.M's best).  Here is the blow-by-blow:<br /><br />Jungle Man -- Doesn't offend me, but sets the tone for the album. 5 out of 10.<br /><br />Hollywood -- I like the Parliament-style tempo slow downs, with the horns muted in the background. Pure Clinton. But points subtracted for Keidis' god-awful \\"singing\\".  5 out of 10.<br /><br />American Ghost Dance -- Keidis tries to sing/rap, which takes away from the cookin' band behind him. 5 out of 10.<br /><br />If You Want Me To Stay -- A HUGE disappointment. Here is Clinton finally taking on Sly Stone, and instead he decides to ape the song note-for-note. Why do it then? They don't expand or improve on the original, and the result really sounds like karaoke at times. 1 out of 10, only for the cool humming at the end of tune.<br /><br />Nevermind -- The Peppers finally do their own thing instead of trying to sound like Parliament. But...they instead sound like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. 4 out of 10.<br /><br />Freaky Styley -- My favorite cut on the album. Here, we see what a  Clinton/Peppers union might have produced over the course of an entire  album, but sadly this is the exception as opposed to the rule. 8 out of 10.<br /><br />Blackeyed Blonde -- Flea finally gets to show his chops a bit, which is always a good thing. 7 out of 10.<br /><br />The Brothers Cup -- They were running out of ideas by this time. 3 out of 10.<br /><br />Battle Ship -- Here starts their salute to LA punk. They've got the speed part down, for sure. 4 out of 10.<br /><br />Lovin' and Touchin' -- A cool little interlude. Wish they had done more with this. 7 out of 10.<br /><br />Catholic School Girls Rule -- Yes they do! 5 out of 10<br /><br />Sex Rap -- See my review of Battle Ship. 4 out of 10.<br /><br />Thirty Dirty Birds -- Why? Why do this?<br /><br />Yertle The Turtle -- Limp and weak. Wisely, the Peppers' management started steering them away from rap to actual singing. And also away from songs about Dr. Seuss books.  2 out of 10.<br /><br />So overall, I give the album a generous two stars. At least it wasn't  boring, not with George Clinton involved. And I now have the correct Red Hot Chili Peppers album in my music collection.n't expand or improve on the original, and the result really sounds like karaoke at times. 1 out of 10, only for the cool humming at the end of tune.

B000OY8NII|4.0|Since Farscape ended I have searched for something SciFi to peak my interest and Eureka seems to fit the bill.  It deals with the unknown of science fiction, however it has GREAT character developement that I long to see in shows.  I have called Eureka \\"Farscape Lite\\" because of its unusual quirkiness and character interaction.  They deal with loss of life, innocence, childhood, jobs, home and love!  The people of Eureka all seem to have their strength and weaknesses with a little sinister developements underneath.    Eureka is not the best SciFi you will see, however not since Farscape have I been able to watch and hour of good SciFi and feel the gamit of emotions and have a tear or more in my eyes at the end.  I am so glad season two was brought to being by the Sci Fi Channel and this second season has not dissapointed.  Be careful watching this season one of Eureka because you may get hooked like I did!

B0009H1CK6|5.0|If you love funk, buy this DVD right now.  Nile Rogers' and Omar Hakim's performances alone make this a no brainer purchase. Add a great set list, top production quality and stellar vocals and horn section and this DVD is one of the best.  The set list includes all of Chic's top hits, plus Rogers' hits with Diana Ross and Sister Sledge-all stellar performances. The bass player, a big fan of Bernard Edwards, is humble and very capable filling the big shoes of his idol.  Every musician on the stage is an all star!  I was impressed from beginning to end and I'm not easy to please.  I put it on and my whole family including my son(6) and daughter(8) were dancing around the family room.  Great job by Nile putting this whole prodcution together.  A must have for those who love funk!
0446698326|5.0|Like all Sparks novels, this one has the elements of highly detailed scene descriptions, well-developed characters, true love, and of course, a touch of sadness.      This novel does a superb job of capturing the reality of love.  It's a powerful feeling that can carry a relationship through the most challenging situations (i.e. a soldier living thousands of miles away from home).  However, it's not always enough.     The reality is that circumstance (Fate) can break down even the strongest relationship.  We all want to believe that if we truly find our \\"soul mate\\" or our one true love, all of the other obstacles in life will fade away.      Sparks captures this well, but he also leaves us with (what I believe to be his general outlook on the issue) the fact that true love nevers dies.  When you truly fall in love with someone, it is a connection that remains in your heart throughout the rest of your life.  Even years later, even if you're with someone new, the feeling is something that remains strong within your heart.    I thought this book captured both of these elements very well and very realisitically.  I could completely relate to John and Savannah.

The whole cruelty-free thing will make your conscience happy, of course, but who cares about that when it tastes... so... good... I cannot rave enough.
0060934700|4.0|I first met Gaiman's storytelling craft and writting style a long time ago through his Sandman comics. To that work I give five-plus stars.    After that I read some of his novels. His books Neverwhere, American Gods and Good Omens were good, but to my opinion not superb. I gave them 3 stars. I thought his comics were better than his novels. And then I decided to try his short stories.    Something told me that those would be better.    I bought Smoke & Mirrors (along with Fragile Things), and it took around one week for delivery. I read Smoke & Mirrors in less time that it took to be delivered. It is not that I am such a fast reader or Amazon too slow delivering (at leas not always), but I just wanted to read more stories. I think that his style is suited better for short stories than for long novels. Even though Gaiman is a strange mix of Stephen King and Edgar A. Poe (within an Allan Moore), he is more a Poe. His short stories are very good. and now I'm reading Fragile Things.     I still think of Gaiman as an excellent comic writter, thats the reason I only give 5 stars to his comics and stick to 4 for his short stories.    My favorite stories were the last tale in the book (Snow, Glass, Apples), and also the tales: Murder Mysteries, Change, Nicholas was... (very very very short story but equally good), Babycakes and a story that is hidden in the introduction called Wedding Gift (don't miss reading the introduction!!!).  I also liked his poem White Road. Pretty \\"upsettling\\", as Humpty Dumpty would have said.    Enjoy
6305784116|5.0|For Persian cat lovers like me (and probably cat lovers in general) as well as those who adore all things French, this film is simply delightful! A darling little tale of a mother Persian cat living the pampered life in Paris with her kittens when the evil butler learns that the mistress of the house plans to leave everything to the cats. So naturally (being an evil butler and all) he decides to throw the cats out into the countryside where he believes that they will be lost forever or surely die. Thankfully, once there, they meet up with a loveable (is there ever any other kind in Disney films?) tramp named Tom who teaches them the joys of the \\"free\\" life. Other reviewers have said that this film isn't to the level of many of the other Disney films and they are perhaps correct. However, this is very cute, the animation is beautiful, the voices are rich, and while the music isn't much (certainly can't hold a candle to the Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast), it provides a good enough soundtrack for this cat lover's dream.
B000RZIGYU|5.0|This is one of my favorite action films.  For its time, the concept of \\"face off\\" and how both Travolta and Cage can act so good and so evil makes this one of the best action films.  Definitely will get it as soon as the HD DVD comes out!
B000HD1AEA|5.0|The majority of my favorite songs are on Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, so when I found this after having bought the original Mirrorball and the DVD, I snapped it up immediately so that I could have the DVD on CD.  The songs are not as polished as the original Mirrorball, but it's not as if the songs aren't up to the same standard - it's just a different performance.      If you're a fan, you must have this.  There's more energy in the live versions than in the album versions, and if you haven't been to a Sarah concert (like me) it will likely give you the urge to go.
0307275639|4.0|As a sports fan, I was already familiar with Albom's work before this phenomenal little book came along.  I stayed away from it for all these years, afraid that it would be a Pablum-encrusted little self-help volume.  My wife bought the book and recommended it so I decided to invest three hours and join its long list of readers.<br /><br />What I found was a relatively unsentimental and humanistic look at dying.  Morrie of the title is an former sociology professor of the author who is dying of Lou Gehrig's disease.  A novelistic coincidence gets Mitch and Morrie back together after more than two decades for a series of Tuesday meetings to discuss important topics--family, marriage, faith, work, and of course dying (there were others, and I may not have these exactly right, working from memory).  Morrie faces his predicament with amazing grace and courage.  Or course, in sharing his soul with Mitch, Morrie helps Mitch find a bit of his own soul--a little sentimental, but okay in this context.<br /><br />As a Unitarian-Universalist with an ambivalent view of what happens after death, \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" appealed to me with its message that life takes place on earth, primarily through our relationships with others.  Career-oriented and otherwise driven people could benefit from taking three hours out to read this short and enlightening book about a man who lived and died on this own terms, making the world a better place in the process.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Instead, it is a feast for the eyes and the ears with a fantastic cast, great soundtrack, and probably the best visuals of the new millennium. I know, I know, for about 10% of the male population (and about 90% of the chickies out there) this will be basically porn: the best bodies this side of the WWE, pumped and oiled, wearing little more than leather thongs, but Gerald Butler's amazing dramatic abilities (along with a great supportive cast) take this film from the B level cheese fest that was the very sorry \\"Troy\\" and turn their tale into true art. The dialogue is very solid and strong (almost \\"Braveheart\\" like, which is a very high compliment), and while there are surely many embellishments, the main story stays pretty close to history. Personnally, while I admire the Spartans for their heroic stand, their culturally blessed child abuse (which the film barely touches upon) completely disgusts me and I couldn't get that completely out of my mind when watching this film where they are obviously supposed to be the living embodiment of a free society. However, as I had said before, the scenery is great, the story is deeply moving, and if the US army had any sense they would use this as a way of inspiring young would be recruits rather than that lame \\"Army of One\\" slogan.

B000QFAJ7S|2.0|I was really looking forward to this new cd as a Kelly Clarkson fan but unfortunately the only really good song was the 1st one \\"Never Again\\". It's a bit more rock than her usual style and I really like it but the rest of the cd bounces between disco, and sort of folk rock. It's uncentered and now I understand why the record company didn't want to release it.

B000055X3U|2.0|I heard a lot of great things about this band from all the bands I like; Steven Wilson apparently loves it.  However, I just could not find anything about this album the least bit interesting.  I agree with a reviewer who said that \\"Deep\\" was a good one, but that was about it.  Every other song just seemed very uneventful, with nothing interesting to offer lyrically or musically.      Maybe giving them two stars is just a bit rough, but hey to each their own right?  I just feel like people are too often given a false precept on some albums on amazon; people only seem to want to review albums they like.      Alright to sum it up, I really was bored with this album and it felt like more a chore to listen to it than an experience.  All the songs sound very similar: dark and melancholy (I like depressing music but depressing coupled with boring is just dreadful).  I wish I would have bought a different album from this band as my first exposure, but unfortunately, I bought this one and I have been turned off to the band since.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I do not like animal type shows (unless it is how to prepare them for the grill) The first time I watched this on Discovery HD, I was floored. This is such a breath taking video, it is unreal. This series is in a whole new class unto itself.<br /><br />This series actually has David Attenborough and the narrator and not Sig Weaver. I like that much better.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|It is so good. All the acting is amazing (coming from a theater major.) The storyline is plausable. There are no plot holes. It is quite engaging. The romance aspect is perfect. Not too overdone. A must see for everyone. My family and I all have quite different tastes in movies (a horror/history buff, a romance/comedy fanatic, a blood and guts/adventure lover and an educational fan) and we all loved it. So, take my advice. If you don't buy it, at least watch it twice. The second time is so much better than the first. And it just keeps gettting better and better.

B000007R1M|4.0|Kraftwerk took a sudden shift from \\"[[ASIN:B000087HXN Trans-Europe Express]]\\" to \\"The Man Machine.\\" The perfectly posed and sharp dressed men on the cover of \\"Trans Europe Express\\" are replaced by whitefaced, plastic looking men with red-lipstick and the demeanor of mannequins. The themes of the songs shifted as well, from driving along the highways to the sound of science. This wasn't just a gender-f**k. This was the sounds of men teasing you into wondering...where they human or machine?<br /><br />It makes \\"The Man Machine\\" a pivotal album of the seventies. As dated as the synthesizers of 1978 sound today, it is easy to listen to \\"The Robots\\" and \\"The Model\\" and hear the roots that eventually blossomed into Thomas Dolby, Gary Numan, Devo and The Human League, to name a few. Even as cold as these machines were, the songs are still warm-bloodedly hypnotic. From the glowing future represented by \\"Spacelab\\" to the more sinister sounding \\"Metropolis,\\" these four Germans never lost sight of the \\"Man\\" in \\"The Man Machine.\\"<br /><br />At a mere six songs at roughly 36 minutes, there isn't a wasted note here. Once they turned the corner from human into humanoid, Kraftwerk never looked back. But it is still hard to register just what a paradigm shift \\"The Man Machine\\" was when it first landed in 1978. Everyone from Afrika Bambaatac (\\"Planet Rock\\") to David Bowie (\\"[[ASIN:B00001OH7W Low]]\\") was listening to the sound of automatons.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is the movie that everyone should watch, but yet should just leave it alone.    Donnie Darko is magnificently philosophical and beautiful. The concepts and themes in the movie are explored excellently, although in the middle of the book one might find there to be too many such themes.    The wonderful thing about Donnie Darko is that it'll haunt you. The ending is not particularly explosive, or particularly violent, compared to action flicks such as Die Hard, but once the movie ends, you'll find yourself constantly reexploring the movie, finding plot points and character developments.    The direction of Richard Kelly is particularly fantastic. The way he makes each scene connect with the viewer and symbolizes so many of the characters is fascinating... One might assume him to be a seasoned director, but he is really young, and his gifts and talents are not to be taking for granted.    Donnie Darko, however haunting, makes you want to just cuddle up in a corner as well, wishing you had never watched the movie for the great amount of depressing characteristic it presents. Donnie Darko is the cult classic that is beatifully dark and tranquilizing... you'll never be the same once you watch it.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|I didn't buy this for years because I already had the songs on other CD's, vinyl singles and LP's. I gave in and bought it recently for several reasons.  First, I wanted to hear the songs remastered. Second,  I wanted a hits collection without buying the red and blue collections which would overduplicate my existing collection and , lastly, I wanted the booklet with the pictures of various singles sleeves.   Overall, I find it an enjoyable collection.      The Beatles were, first and foremost a tightly-knit performing unit capable of grinding out rock 'n' roll on par, if not better than, any group extant in the sixties.  Listen to any early live recordings from  Germany or Liverpool, or any BBC sessions.  This collection will not bear witness to that.  I bring this up because someone, perhaps George Martin although I'm not sure, seems to have toned done the mixes somewhat and some of the rockers tend to lose the original edge, especially with on drum tracks.  The more pop-oriented selections and orchestral selections do shine, benefitting from the remastering immensely.    Of course, their hits are not always their best works, however often enough, they are as good as any album cut even if they are more pop oriented.  And they are hits.  Enough said.
B00006RAKP|5.0|In the sea of existing Elton's \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilations, this 2-CD set is the one that better resumes his career's highlights in my opinion (surely not considering the post-2002 releases). No need to wonder which one of all those available today to choose from.<br /><br />Personally, I found this release more complete than the others since includes not only his most meaningful hits (although I know a \\"Greatest Hits\\" doesn't necessarily include his best songs), but also a booklet which tells interesting facts about his career, including a bunch of photographs from his early years. By the content found both on the CDs and the booklet, one might think - not without a reason - that this release was made targeting specially the US market.<br /><br />My favorites are: \\"Your Song\\", \\"Crocodile Rock\\", \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\", \\"Philadelphia Freedom\\", \\"Little Jeannie\\", \\"Sad Songs\\" and \\"Circle of Life\\". Today, this compilation costs a little more than the price of a single CD, contains 34 songs, so it's an interesting purchase from the cost-benefit standpoint. It's worth the investment.
0440234743|5.0|I got this book from the book club. I've read just about all of John Grisham's novels, but for some reason I missed this one. I'm certainly glad I didn't, because I thought The Testament was close to being one of his best. I really enjoyed \\"The Partner\\", but this book ranks right up there. The characters were likable and believable. Mr. Grisham has demonstrated once more that he has a social conscience. He created a lovely and easy to understand description of the Gospel of Jesus. Certainly, the best that I have ever read. I'm sure that if people read this book they will get a better understanding as to how God works and that he his there for them in their time of need. Just a wonderful story
B00005R24K|4.0|This movie set the stage (and a high bar) for campy horror flicks that followed. For fun, I researched the \\"prequel\\" that Sam Raimi put together for less than $2K called \\"Within the Woods,\\" which he used to attract more funding for \\"Evil Dead.\\" It's 30 minutes of raw footage, and quite spooky.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|I've never been the greatest fan of Beatrix Potter's charming little books.  As a child I more admired them than liked them thinking their tales a bit stuffy and cautionary.  After viewing this film I've gained a greater understanding of the time in which these books were written plus a respect for their author.  Renee Zellweger portrays an awkward, plucky Beatrix whom we can't help but care about and root for.  The conventions and restrictions of the age are well employed within the story, from the fact that over-thirty Beatrix required an escort everywhere she went, to the absolute unquestioning obedience and respect she paid, however grudgingly, to her parents many overbearing requests despite her advanced age.  Yet here is a woman who did manage, as she put it, to make her own way, to find satisfaction and security in her talents, to eventually live life as she wished, to suffer love and loss only to marry later in life and happily from all accounts, and develop into a smart businesswoman.  Beatrix Potter became a landowner and conservationist and a working farmer at a time when her \\"class\\" of women were more to be mollycoddled than anything else.  (It's not mentioned in the film, but Beatrix was also a respected mycologist and her paintings of mushrooms and fungi are regarded as some of the finest.)  The greatest treats in the film are the many Potter drawings come to life and the gorgeous Lake District scenery.  Plus the extreme historical accuracy.  Zellweger did not wear makeup and looked very much as Potter would naturally -- messy hair, wrinkled a tad, a touch sunburned from tramping the woods which Miss Potter did with gusto whever she could.

Adventure abounds, deeply layered characters and a story that makes this a very difficult book to put down. On my Top Ten List of All Time Favorite Books.
0060574216|5.0|I find this book to be quite amazing. I usually don't bother reading these types of books, but I found it very helpful. I couldn't put the book down after I started.     I never understood why my partner can't relate to me. After reading \\"Men Are From Mars, Women Are from Venus\\", I have a very clear understanding. I felt resentful and neglected many of times but being able to understand the opposite sex makes a huge difference. I really recommend reading this book because it improves and help you understand your relationship. Also, help to improve yourself. It taught me how to control my anger and give more love to partner.

1594489505|5.0|I wish to thank the author for this thought provoking and enlightening book about two women from very different backgrounds, from the same country...Afghanistan.  The passage...\\"grievances unspoken, burdens gone unprotested, a destiny submitted to and endured\\"....will stay in my mind and heart for a long time.

B000F3T7X8|3.0|Regarded by many as the best album Japan ever did, \\"Gentlemen Take Polaroids was no doubt revolutionary, excitng, and quite different from anything Japan had done before. David Sylvian had developed as a songwriter, finally finishing the shedding of the overt glam/David Bowie influence that so heavily dominated the early Japan work, and moving into a dance/synth pop/proto ambient direction. Equally important is the development of Steve Jansen as a drummer who knows when not to play as well as when to play (Jansen today in my assessment is a master of economy in drumming, managing a simple one beat fill that often surprasses what others would do), Richard Barbieri developing an extensive vocabulary, not just as a keyboardist, but as a synthesizer driver, and Mick Karn coalescing his style into a fully mature form. When the material works, it's brilliant, but in general, I find the album a bit inconsistent.    But again, the great cuts are great-- certainly little in Japan or anyone else's catalog compares to \\"Nightporter\\". Starting as a piano ballad and eventually building into an orchestral (albeit synth-driven) arrangement, the piece is brilliant and melancholy, with Sylvian's vocal being effecting and powerful. It's really what Japan had been building towards (Japan would in my assessment surprass this on \\"Tin Drum\\" with the stunning \\"Ghosts\\"). While nothing else on the album is quite this powerful, the unusual \\"My New Career\\" (an off-kilter pop song with a bizarre beat and some great bass work from Mick Karn) and hte building \\"Burning Bridges\\", which starts as kind of a lifeless synth number but eventually builds to a powerful climax, both take note.    Still, there's enough material that doesn't cut it for me-- several pieces are somewhat dull synth pop/dance pieces, usually filled with irritating samples/synth sounds and far too long (\\"Gentlemen Take Polaroids\\", \\"Methods of Dance\\", \\"Taking Islands in Africa\\"). This remaster, with extraordinarily crisp sound, also adds three bonus tracks-- two b-side instrumentals that really don't contribute much (\\"The Width of a Room\\" is decent, but somewhat unnecessary) and a remix of \\"Taking Islands in Africa\\".    With it's flaws, 'Polaroids' is an unbalanced album, but it has a number of important and powerful songs on it that make it worth digging up.
B000A7Q2DM|2.0|\\"Attack\\", \\"The Kill\\", \\"Was It A Dream?\\" \\"The Fantasy and even the over played \\"From Yesterday\\" are the tracks that stick with you. The rest of the album isn't that good. The others are kind of slow and blend in together. I fell asleep while listening to this album.
B000PY52EU|4.0|I just watched this movie.  I didn't know quite what to expect when I rented it but I have to say that I loved it.  The story is intriguing and the charactors wonderfully flawed but sympathetic.  I loved the music playing through it and thought it was a perfect counterpoint.  The actors did a phenomenal job of making their parts believable and capable of moving the viewer to empathize with their loss and pain.
B0000E5NPZ|5.0|Some Bad Movies demand a response in the French style - every few minutes, you'll find yourself striking your hand to your forehead while shrieking, \\"Alors!\\" Just such a choice pastry is Otto Preminger's 1958 film version of Francoise Sagan's novel Bonjour Tristesse (which means, more or less, \\"Hello, sadness\\"), the filmmaker's second, and final, attempt to turn Jean Seberg into a star - they'd bombed a year before with Saint Joan. Pert, perky and as American as apple pie, Seberg was perhaps the last actress who could pass for an amoral, Parisian teen temptress whose incestuous feelings for her aging roue father - she calls him, ahem, \\"darling\\" - spell doom for anyone he seriously gets involved with.<br /><br />The beginning of this howler, set in the \\"present,\\" is shot--meaningfully - in black and white, the better to capture the stark ennui of Seberg's poor-little-rich-girl life. Out on the dance floor in a chic Paris boite, Seberg stares moonily into a camera and tells us in voice-over, \\"I can't feel anything...it isn't the same anymore. Nothing is.\\" Sure, you've guessed that Seberg will also mutter, \\"Will I ever be happy again as I was at the beginning of that wonderful summer on the Riviera?\\" thereby cueing a flashback - shot, meaningfully, in color - but no one could anticipate that before this occurs, starlet Juliette Greco turns up to croak out the film's fall-down-funny title tune: \\"The street I walk is sadness/My house has no address/The letters that I write me/ Begin 'Bonjour, tristesse.'\\"<br /><br />Alors!<br /><br />Summering sinfully in a villa with her rich daddy-o (David Niven) and his mistress-of-the-moment (Mylene Demongeot), Seberg trills dialogue like, \\"Wait! Let's smell the day!\\" so sunnily she seems to have traipsed in from a Gidget movie. Into this cozy triangle wanders Givenchy-clad Deborah Kerr, who, as the world's foremost fashion designer, inexplicably has marital designs on womanizing, good-for-nothing Niven. In no time, Niven's romancing Kerr (\\"I've never wanted any woman the way I want you\\"). Demongeot hits the road (\\"I will not be treated like a wife!\\") and Seberg is forced to explain to us how she feels (\\"Part of me was angry, part of me was happy, all of me was excited\\"), since she's utterly unable to register any emotion on her blank face.<br /><br />When Niven and Kerr start sleeping together, then announce they're engaged, Seberg is so jealous of Kerr - about whom she gushes, \\"She looks softer, moves easier... I wish I walked the way she walks now\\" - she literally jumps Geoffrey Horne, the hunky male starlet next door. Then, when Kerr reprimands her - \\"You should realize such diversions can end up in a hospital!\\" - Seberg goes bonkers at the notion of losing Niven and gaining a stepmother-cum-truant officer, and begins to plan Kerr's heave-ho. After sticking voodoo pins into her doll, Seberg tells us, on the soundtrack, \\"I actually spent days comparing the contestants for my father,\\" while she chalks up a blackboard comparison of herself and Kerr in such categories as \\"Fun,\\" \\"Chic,\\" \\"Possessiveness\\" and \\"Flirting.\\" (Tellingly, Seberg doesn't put \\"Acting\\" on the board.) Just in case we think she doesn't deserve to get dumped, Kerr suddenly gets prissy, denouncing Niven's alcoholic pals: \\"In the end, their only memories will be of hangovers!\\" Then, Seberg seduces Horne into feigning a romance with Demongeot, which - oh, don't ask - provokes Kerr into driving off a cliff into the sea.<br /><br />Alors!<br /><br />Back in the black-and-white \\"present,\\" Seberg confides that she and Niven \\"have an unspoken agreement to never mention last summer\\" -- the very deal, we'd guess, they cut after finishing this film.nted any woman the way I want you\\").

B000F5GNX8|3.0|This is the kind of movie that would have been really hip about 15 years ago. You know what I'm talking about: the kind of modern post-Tarantino movie that first started appearing when we were in high school. Stuff shown slightly out of order, esoteric Seinfeild-like conversations at key dramatic points, and a main character who is aware that he is part of a movie and often addresses the camera or takes over the narration. Part \\"Pulp Fiction\\", part \\"Get Shorty\\", part \\"Fight Club.\\"    Despite the fact that all the cool kids quit watching these kind of movies years ago, I still think they're great popcorn flicks. When I want to come home and relax, this is exactly the kind of move I look for. Simple enough that I can turn off most of my brain, and yet with enough twists, sharp editing, and funny voice over narration to cater to my ruined attention span. Perfect for just shoving in the popcorn     I wouldn't really recommend this movie, and yet the two hours I spent watching it were pleasant enough. It's not the best movie in its genre, and often it seems like it is trying too hard to be funny. Robert Downy Jr. as the main character/ narrator sometimes seems like he's doing his Woody Allen impression as an incredibly verbose narrator who runs every joke into the ground. Whether that's his fault, or just the script they gave him, I'm not sure, but often through the course of this movie I felt myself feeling embarrassed on behalf of Robert Downy Jr. But that's part of the fun of this movie as well; the perverse pleasure of seeing another human being make a fool of himself.    And some parts of the movie were actually kind of funny. I've definitely seen a lot worse in my time.

Perhaps if this book wasn't given The Best of 2006 Amazon Editor's Award, and wasn't billed as a ghost story, I would have not been so disappointed.

Other superb tracks here are in your face<br /> Bloody Well Right, the tender Hide In Your Shell exhorts people to give and recieve love and thereby bringhappiness to themselves and others, the colourful Dreamer, the artistic tital track Crime Of The Century, and Rudy deals with the loneliness and pain of a man who has been ignored by those around him and has never found love and companionship.Something that is quite common in todays world.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|Okay, there are already a spate of great reviews out there. This review focuses purely on whether to pay a little extra for the Special Edition.<br /><br />In brief - don't hesitate - if you have a home theater system - get the Special Edition! No hesitation. The 5.1 Surround Sound mix of the album is a sonic delight. At the moment on Amazon (11/08/07) you are only paying a dollar more for the Special Edition. You get a double CD disk with embossed Special Edition outer sleeve (slightly raised title and imagery - very cool!) - you get the Stereo CD with booklet PLUS a DVD with an insightful 90 minute documentary which also has the entire album in 5.1 Surround Sound.<br /><br />Wow! You play the opening bars of the album on 5.1 and keyboards swirl around your head left and right - Portnoy crashes a hole through the wall in front of you and as the full power chords fill the room you are instantly aware of one of the most exciting mixes I have ever heard of a DT studio album. Simply stunning. So heavy, heavy, heavy with a bottom-end the shakes the foundations but with the clarity and precision of all instruments combined that is far more evident in 5.1 than what you hear on stereo.<br /><br />Paul Northfield has done wonders with Petrucci and Portnoy to provide a great mix for the stereo album - but this is even more noticeable on 5.1. Brilliant stuff! Not since Liquid Tension Experiment have the bass and drums sounded so in your face!<br /><br />For Portnoy fans - many of the complicated drum fills spiral across the speakers with such separation yet always centred on the front stage. When James's voice is first heard - the band is spread in panoramic sound - but his crystal clear notes slice through that centre speaker. Spine-tingling!<br />That voice cutting through is particularly evident on 'The Dark Eternal Night' where grunge chorus voices are sunk into the bedrock of the track but James's solo voice cuts through the mix almost with a cocoon of silence separating his voice from the heaviest riff I have heard for a long time.<br /><br />Listen to the beautiful opening minute of 'Repentence' - and you'll instantly never want to listen in stereo again. The 5.1 does such a brilliant job of conveying the heaviness of the bass and bass drum against the cutting crisp plucked guitar notes. Awesome!<br /><br />Yes, 5.1 is maybe an exaggerated sound stage but it is so fitting to this music. At the same time let me assure the purists that the bulk of the ten-ton solid bass and drums are slap in the middle as you expect them with the voice dead center. But be ready for some great surprises as chorus voices go behind you; spoken voices of repentence to extreme 180 degrees left and right, riffs spinning and John's lead breaks soaring.<br /><br />The documentary is an added bonus where we see both serious conversations and boyish banter courtesy the band jester, Mike Portnoy. What I found the most interesting was how Mike included ever major drum fill, lead break both guitar and keyboard that is crucial to the album. So you see all landmark solos actually being recorded in the studio. Some of the vocal recording and visuals of laying down chorus voices was fascinating as well as funny at times. It's great this documentary is added as a bonus - but in summary - the reason you should get the Special Edition is simply an amazing 5.1 mix. (Plus you can always keep the spare stereo CD for your car or PC!)<br /><br />5 Stars for extra value and the best heavy rockin' 5.1 mix in the business!have heard for a long time.

B00005JPQR|5.0|I think the third chapter of the Bourne films is best, but to explain why, something needs to be said for the comparatively different directorial styles that occur between \\"The Bourne Identity\\" (with Doug Liman) and \\"Supremacy\\" and \\"Ultimatum\\" (with Paul Greengrass).  Much has been made of Greengrass' \\"shaky\\" and \\"MTV-style\\" quick-cut editing.  Doug Liman favors a far more expository style of filming; he will use a tripod, and when a hand held camera is in play he still makes everything visible.  This tactic allows the more virtuoso fight sequences with a high level of artistry to be most pleasing to viewers.  For an example, watch the apartment fight in Paris in \\"The Bourne Identity.\\"  Every single punch, block, and kick is visible to the viewers--and it's awesome.  We delight in the choreography and skill, and thank the director for showing us everything.  The negative of this style is that more visceral moments (i.e. car chases, sudden impacts, etc.) are less immediate.  As viewers who are safe to see everything, we don't necessarily feel like we are part of that action.  For an example of this, watch the car chase scene in \\"The Bourne Identity.\\"  While entertaining and even creative with the drive down the stairwell, it lacks punch, and we don't feel like we're fully \\"there.\\"  This is where Greengrass comes in.  His use with handheld cameras makes us feel the chaos and immediacy that tripods shy away from.  Watch the car chase from \\"Supremacy.\\"  Every impact is brutal, the moments sudden, the feeling of being trapped complete.  Or consider the way Spielberg used it in \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"  Would the storming of the beach in Normandy be as effective if the handhelds weren't used to make us feel completely there and part of the action?  Now, I'm not saying Greengrass is Spielberg.  In \\"Supremacy,\\" I thought he went much too far with the handhelds and made the centerpiece fight scene borderline unwatchable.  All I saw were flayling limbs, and all I heard were grunts and the sounds of punches.  All in all, I left the theatre dissapointed.  I thought Greengrass had done a great job using the handhelds in scenes of dialogue and in the final car chase, but that all the hand-to-hand combat which I had loved in the first film had been brutally skewed.  Now, Greengrass is back for \\"Ultimatum.\\"  When I heard this, I was very worried.  However, halfway through the movie, I realized I was in the hands of a director who had kept everything good from \\"Supremacy\\" and improved upon it's faults threefold.  This doesn't mean you will see each fight scene with the clarity of Doug Liman.  But what will happen is that you will feel the immediacy AND be able to appreciate the choreography at the same time.  This doesn't mean Greengrass has used less handheld camera work.  It some cases, it's more frenetic because there is more action and more chases.  But I firmly believe that he has fixed what was broken in Supremacy.  In each fight scene, I was finally able to follow what was going on and revel in the virtuosity of the action, and on top of that, the handheld cameras made me feel like I was absoutely there.  Is the centerpiece fight in Tangier as good or better than the one in Paris from \\"Bourne Identity?\\"  I'd have to see the movie again to be sure, but my first instinct (while openly chuckling with enjoyment) was yes.  It was brutal, visceral, and completely watchable.  That's pretty much how all of \\"Ultimatum\\" is, with the addition of being well-acted, smart, and the best action movie of the year.
0451209338|5.0|I listened to the The Kill Artist on tape.  Totally enjoyed it.  Loved the book.  The author's brilliant writing style comes through clearly even when listened to, rather than read.  The plot is not totally original but the characterization is so excellent and the writing style so clear and engaging that the same old spy vs spy story rings fresh and true. There is also a very intriguing twist at the end. I am looking forward to reading or listening to the other works in this series.

While I thinking \\"Loathing\\" is a masterpiece and Menzel does an amazing job on \\"Devying Gravity\\", the rest of the CD is rather ho-hum.  Everyone in my family skips the two songs by the wizard (booooorrrring!!!!!).  If you've not seen the show, the CD does not give you many clues into the storyline.  If you were fortunate enough to see the show with the original cast, it's a great memory of their vocal abilities.  Of all the Broadway CDs in our house (almost 50), this one gets played the least.
0810993139|5.0|If you work with middle grade kids, be sure to check out DIARY OF A WIMPY KID.<br /><br />Greg Heffley is a 6th-grade weakling trying to make his mark in the middle school world.  His family includes a mom, a dad, a heavy metal big brother, and a whiny, tattling little brother.  His best friend is Rowley, another odd 6th-grader with overprotective parents and the world-class ability to annoy.<br /><br />Greg is always a victim of the big, mean bullies in the school. He constantly seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  In an attempt to be \\"cool\\" he experiments with the idea of weightlifting, creating his own haunted house, running for class treasurer, and building a snowman big enough to be considered for the Guiness Book of World Records.  However, the only mild success he accomplishes is as a safety guard whose job is to walk the kindergarten kids home at lunchtime.<br /><br />At least with that job he gets free hot chocolate and misses twenty minutes of math class.<br /><br />Readers will be able to relate to Greg's typical teenage problems. His parents ground him from his video games, his older brother picks on him, his little brother gets him in trouble, and the girls in his school think he is a waste of their time. He'd like to pretend he's just a mediocre student when he is really one of the \\"uncool\\" gifted kids. The odds are just stacked against him.<br /><br />Kinney bills his books as \\"a novel in cartoons,\\" which is sure to be a popular feature with middle grade readers, especially those of the reluctant variety.  The clever illustrations were a fantastic way to play up the already great humor in the book.<br /><br />Once again, if you have anything at all to do with middle graders, get this book in their hands ASAP.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Sally Kruger, aka \\"Readingjunky\\"
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This movie is amazing.  If you loved Sin City, you're going to love \\"300.\\"  I'm also a big fan of \\"Gladiator.\\"  The sepia tones and white diffused combinations are just beautiful.  The graphics are great, and the fighting scenes are well choreographed.  Plus, it has a good plot/story behind it.    I bought the Blu-Ray version because I'm using my PS3 for playback.  But, if you have/prefer hd-dvd, then get that version.  The HD-DVD version has some extra features that those who own the format may enjoy.      Again, order it today.  You're going to love it.

B000QUCNP4|4.0|All that is on it in the extras section is a trailer for the director's special deluxe whatever edition coming out.  Which will have everything on it.  Just wait to buy that- they even show the coverart for it so I bet it will be out before xmas.  I rented it thankfully.  Liked the movie a lot.  I like Fincher's films and this one was very good but will be too long for short attention span folks.  I thought it flowed through 2 hours and 40 minutes well, though.    Now, for the geeky, tech side.  I couldn''t agree more with another reviewer.  I watched it last night on my HD DVD player, upsampled and then on my 56\\" HDTV.  Now 56\\" usually reveals the bad parts of standard dvd's but through the whole movie, i was wondering where all the jaggies were coming from.  I mean this is the ultimate scaling abuse DVD for a scaler I've ever seen.  The scalers in my player and even TV are pretty good for consumer grade and this transfer was annoying.  Anytime there's a grid pattern on clothes or wherever in this dvd...it's a nightmare. This has to come out on HD because Fincher's dark films need good transfers.  For just having basically the movie only- this should be a great high bitrate, dual layer transfer, that uses most of the disc...but it doesn't seem to.  And whoever bought this DID get a slap in the face for the D.C. trailer that basically tells you that you just got duped into buying a bad regular edition.    Great film...bad DVD.
B000I0RR76|5.0|I own this title on laserdisc and DVD. I was not sure if it could look any better since the movie is almost 70 years old. The answer is yes. I played the DVD version and the HD-DVD and you will see the difference. The colors are very vivid on HD-DVD...Robin Hood's tights are sharp green. The sound is not that great, but that is understandable. The extras are really good too, including the Merrie Melodies shorts. Considering that this movie was released in 1938, I am still amazed with the image and color quality of this film.
6304711905|4.0|I am giving this movie 4 stars, but what I'd really like to do is give it 3.5.<br /><br />So much about this movie bugged me, but it was a great action flick and was a movie about one of my \\"Old West\\" heroes, so there you go. I give it an extra half star because of that. (Well that, and it stars Kurt Russell, Bill Paxton and an EXCELLENT Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday!)<br /><br />The portrayals were pretty spot on... however, so many facts in this movie were mixed up and made up and forged and falsified that it might as well be called Historical Fiction.<br /><br />First, When Wyatt and the boys are going to disarm the Clanton gang, we see a building burning in the background. Though Virgil's attention is momentarily drawn, he continues on toward handling the misdemeanor crime of carrying a weapon in town, rather than doing his duty to help put out the fire. As the town would've likely not had a great system for putting out fires, (No fire station for one!) It was up to Virgil as the ranking law man to see to it that this fire was put out. This would have been his first concern. Not whether or not some drunk idiots were carrying concealed weapons.<br /><br />Second, Morgan was not killed on the same night Virgil was shot. Virgil was shot in December, just two months after the OK Corrall Incident. Morgan was murdered in March the following year.<br /><br />Furthermore, the COWBOYS did not wear red sashes. Curly Bill was not the leader, nor was Ike Clanton, nor was Johnny Ringo. The Cowboys were a loose band of outlaws. The whole point of being an outlaw is that you don't want to follow a leader. You might be banded together for a common purpose but you don't recognize authority.<br /><br />There is no proof that Doc Holliday killed Johnny Ringo. In fact, it's more than likely he did not, as he was reportedly not in the area when and where Ringo's body was found. Most reports today claim Ringo's wound was self-inflicted.<br /><br />Wyatt was not at the Sanitarium where Doc died. In fact, he did not even hear about Doc's death until a couple of years later. By most accounts, Wyatt never visited Doc and he never wrote a book about his friend, Doc Holliday. Current research suggests Doc spent time in a sanitarium but may have left and likely died in a hotel room.<br /><br />Josephine Sarah \\"Sadie\\" Marcus Earp was not called Josie. She was in fact called Sadie. Her parents were not wealthy and Wyatt was forced to work in various jobs well into his old age. The infamous photo of her was also of an entirely different woman.<br /><br />Marshall Fred White was not an old man as depicted in Tombstone. Born in 1849, killed in 1880, he would have been a mere 31 years old. Younger than Wyatt who was born circa 1848<br /><br />It has been argued that Doc Holliday was in fact a better friend with Morgan and Virgil than with Wyatt. Yet Doc is always associated with Wyatt Earp.<br /><br />The Cowboys never shot into the Earp's house, or at the Earp women.<br />(Apparently there was SOME honor among thieves)<br /><br />Sherm McMasters was not killed during Earp's Vendetta ride. No body was dragged as a message or challenge to Doc or any member of Earp's posse. In fact, no member of Earp's group died during the course of the Vendetta.<br /><br />Billy Claiborne was not shot by Wyatt Earp during the Earp Vendetta Ride. He was killed by \\"Buckskin\\" Frank Leslie after returning to Tombstone in 1882.<br /><br />Morgan Earp did not die lying on the pool table, but in a cardroom adjoining the billiard parlor<br /><br />All this having been said, I enjoyed the movie.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|When my crazy coworker told me about this series I kind of rolled my eyes. David Fisher as a serial killer?? But he was persistant and taped it off showtime for me and when I watched it I was thirlled! What wonderful acting by Michael C. Hall because he completely shed his previous role. I am so glad I had all the episodes to watch at once because it would have KILLED me to watch them seperatley! So suspensful, scary and funny at the same time. You really do end up liking Dexter and it sort of throws you off balance a little. Who likes serial killers? I read the book too and honestly this is once instance where the TV show was better than the book.  I can't wait for season two.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|Not sure why this movie was made. I realize they were trying to venture away from the storyline that was Star Treks 2 through 4. However, they did a horrible job of it with this one. Spock's half brother? 1) Who cares? 2) Who believes it? After 50 years aboard the Enterprise you'd think he might have mentioned it to somebody by now. Surely it would've come up over dinner or something.<br /><br />The entire film is dead and unbelieveable from that introductory moment. A feeling Vulcan that apparently was disowned or disinherited by his people. Shunned or what have you. He becomes a less maniacal version of Khan from Star Trek 2.<br /><br />By the end, you just want Kirk to take out his phaser and kill the guy.
0316010669|3.0|I saw this book on the Oprah show and it looked promising so I bought it. It started out really intresting and the stories were okay but it never does bring all the information together and tell you how you can use it to make better decisions. It was a quick and easy read. It just seemed like a compilation of articles and studies. Some of the interviews were pretty interesting... I'd like to know what he thinks and how I can use this in my life to improve my snap judgements. I agree with most of what he said, but it was nothing that I didn't already know.
1400079276|4.0|This story doesn't really hold up in my opinion. It's also a little silly in its style here and there, but I like it still. I love the local feeling conveyed, and I do enjoy the outlines of the story. Just a little too pieced-together.
B00005JPLW|3.0|*No spoilers*<br />King Leonidas screams hysterically \\"No retreat, no surrender!\\" to his few good men, and we kindly replies \\"That's cool Spartan, but you're in a video game!\\" 300 is one of the most anticipated films of 2007--everyone has been going nuts about those HD internet trailers--but doesn't live up to the hype. The movie relies heavily on CGI cinematography, violent battle scenes, extravagant characters and nudity to hide its paper thing story. There is no Gladiator-like storytelling here--the plot is just secondary in a film that was meant mostly for the XboX 360 generation.<br /><br />Story:<br />The city of Sparta is under siege after a messenger from the Persian Empire, insinuates to King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) that Spartans should surrender to his Persian God-like king. This kind of insult doesn't go well for the Spartan king who kills all these little messengers on the spot. Unfortunately, he knows that war is imminent and needs to be prepared. After consulting his military strategies to some wise deformed men (on the top of a mystic mountain), he decides to go on and take the battle to the Persians--they did not agree with any of his intentions. He manages to recruit 300 of his finest warriors to battle against a million. He says good bye to his beautiful wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) and his young son. Then, he marches on to a battle that could be his last. The 300 Spartans go to war, despite some internal opposition to do so.<br /><br />Review:<br />In the technical department, 300 will probably please most of its younger audience. The surreal-like environment where the story takes place gives us the \\"look and feel\\" of the epic graphic novel--something that fans will probably enjoy. Intense computer graphics are needed to create this almost alien-like ancient world. The battle scenes are intense and well choreographed with plenty of slow motion, computer gore and eye candy landscapes. If you're never seen the trailer or read the graphic novel, you might be annoyed by how the whole thing looks. We think that the movie looks like a video game.<br /><br />Director Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead) shows virtually nothing about the Spartan people other than their king and his six-pack super warriors who want glory by dying in battle--we just get an intro about how \\"early\\" they begin to train as soldiers. Most of the characters are reduced to video game figures that only purpose in life is war and cheesy dialogue. Their enemies are even more extravagant--some of them are very bizarre. No matter how much Mr. Snyder wants to inject some melodramatic moments, the movie is reduced to cool-looking battle scenes and sexy bodies, nothing more.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />There are no history lessons here. It is all about the action and the CGI cinematography--something that has been used a lot lately. 300 is a CGI-driven action film that has plenty of slow-mo battles, lots of skin, but it doesn't have the storytelling of Braveheart or Gladiator.he whole thing looks.

1401211909|5.0|You may have seen commercials for a movie called [[ASIN:B00005JPQL Stardust]] that opened today, August 10, 2007.  Well, before it was a movie, it was a book published by DC Comics' Vertigo imprint.  Despite the fact that it is published by DC Comics, it is not actually a comic book.  It is in fact an illustrated fairy tale for adults.  It has sex, high adventure, low comedy and, most of all, a sense of wonder.  Neil Gaiman has written a fantastic (in every sense of the word) story, and Charles Vess' illustrations (many of them painted) compliment the tale perfectly.  Any fan of the fantasy genre is sure to enjoy this book.
B00000J7JO|4.0|I'm in an interesting position with the Red Hot Chili Peppers: I love their hits and some of their deeper cuts, but I don't think they've made a truly classic album - bar this one, of course. I gave Blood Sugar Sex Magik five stars once, but I'd give it more of a 3.5 now: same with By the Way and Stadium Arcadium. I think each of those albums has the potential to be something great, but each is also overstuffed. That's not a problem with this one: this only lasts 55 minutes - still long, but much more manageable than BSSM's 75 or so; By the Way's 68 and Stadium Arcadium's 122 (for the love of god, guys! That could've been your best album had you trimmed it down a bit!). However, I'm not saying that Californication is the group's best album just because it's short. Oh, no. The songwriting here is fantastic, the best, and more importantly most consistent, it's ever been in the group's history. They had previously reached the highs of (or at least topped) something like the slightly poppy funk-rocker All Around the World as far back as Knock Me Down and Taste the Pain (not to mention Give it Away, Under the Bridge, Breaking the Girl, I Could Have Lied, Soul to Squeeze - why didn't that one show up on a studio album? - and Aeroplane), and would later do so on The Zephyr Song, Can't Stop, Dani California and Snow (Hey Oh). But the fact is that a lot of the other songs on this album measure up to it: compare to By the Way, where nothing but arguably the title track really stood up to The Zephyr Song and Can't Stop: a tough task, don't get me wrong. In fact, great a song as All Around the World is, it might be my least favorite of this album's elite. And what are the elite? The mellow yet therapeutic Scar Tissue is one of my favorite of the group's songs: dealing with John Frusciante's drug problems, it's one of his most poignant moments as a lyricist and features a stellar guitar solo. I've gotta say that Frusciante is simply the best guitarist out of all the big-name alternative rock bands by a long shot: Runner-ups like Jack White (White Stripes) and Jonny Greenwood (Radiohead) don't even come close. Clearly the lyrics are more meaningful here than on most their other releases, as shown on protest tracks like the nonconformist This Purple Stain (pretty good as far as \\"I'm different, just like everybody else\\" songs go), the underrated environmentalist call-to-arms I Like Dirt, and more importantly, the justly famous title song, which brilliantly rails against materialism, \\"adult entertainment\\" (so amazon doesn't block my review), teen pregnancy, and the fake lives the celebrities live. Great lyrics: my favorite is \\"Space may be the final frontier/but it's made in a Hollywood basement\\". They also get confessional, as on the acoustic guitar-and-strings Road Trippin'. You'd expect confessional Chilis to bomb miserably, but it is in truth the exact opposite: simply mind-blowing. I love it. Some songs also find them experimenting with structure, such as Otherside, which morphs from ballad into full-on funk, an effect used in the later song By the Way. Once again, Otherside deals with Frusciante's drug problems, and it's another personal favorite. Parallel Universe isn't funk at all, but it rocks hard and has interesting introspective lyrics. Not quite as good as the title song, All Around the World, Otherside, Scar Tissue and Road Trippin', but a winner just the same. Savior is the album's dark horse, a killer funk-rocker with great chemistry between the musicians.<br />Now here are a couple losers, sadly enough. Get on Top is too dumb for its own good - there are too many idiotic songs about gettin' some (though there are several good ones too), and this falls distinctively into the \\"idiotic\\" category. Porcelian sure is pretty, but thin: Emit Remmus and Easily are both on the annoying side. Interestingly, three of the four are roaring, raucous funk-rockers that the group previously did quite well (and still can do, for that matter). That proves Californication is about the ballads, which it nails. Some fans of the group's older material (which I do not really enjoy) called this a sellout, but I don't buy that: I see it as a good band maturing, broadening their tastes, honing their songwriting skills, and coming up with some music that every rock or funk fan should appreciate.roves Californication is about the ballads, which it nails.

B00005JPQL|4.0|Trust me, I'm referring to splendor in its most literal sense. It pulls many strands of story together: the boy with a love-quest, a triad of evil witches, fratricidal princes, and so many more that they'd all be spoilers (No Spoilers - keep reading). Each piece sounds like something you read your kid to sleep with, hoping desperately that the little one conks out before you do.<br /><br />Same pieces, different story.<br /><br />It's not just the arrangement of the classic pieces that makes it work but the interleaving of the different pieces, right down to the end. But Gaiman has welded all the scraps together, so that the magical opening premise drives directly towards the finale, but with plenty of twists and turns in between.<br /><br />I could pick a few nits with this movie, but choose not to. There's a Beautiful Maiden, of course, but she's really beautiful instead of plastic-perfect pretty. A few bits of plot continuity seemed a little ham-handed, but that's OK. Let your pre-movie dinner have another glass of wine, or bring a kid who wants to feel clever at seeing the foretellings. It's a bit complex for the littler kids, but otherwise reasonably safe for the young'uns. And it's great for the grown-ups, if you're willing to believe that I'm one.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B00000JFV9|5.0|It's a rare thing when I give a soundtrack five stars: the only other example of this is Prince's Purple Rain, which secretly gets 4.5. It's even rarer when I proclaim a soundtrack to be the best album of an artists' career. And that's exactly what I'll say about Superfly.<br />I haven't seen the movie Superfly, though it's on my \\"to-watch\\" list: however, I do know that the consensus is the soundtrack's better than the film: the fact that this outgrossed its parent movie (the only time a soundtrack did so) is truly an impressive fact. It's not that I think record sales = record quality, I just think that this happened is an interesting fact.<br />Most soundtracks are made up of meaningless incidental music that usually sounds a lot better in the context of the film itself than removed from the film. However, even the incidental stuff here is excellent: the instrumental Junkie Chase is a mere 1:29, and I wouldn't have minded if it had lasted a mirror image of its length; that is to say, 9:21: that is one killer groove. (Okay, that's stupid, but so what?). The fact that it's one  of the weaker songs on the album reveals the great listening experience you're in for with this one.<br />There are two indisputable classics on Superfly: Freddie's Dead and the title song. Out of the two, I think Freddie's Dead is slightly better, because it has my personal favorite of Mayfield's lyrics, which is saying something. The power of this drug protest is utterly convincing: in five minutes, Curtis paints a picture of a kind, loving man who was forced into a life of crime (drug dealing in this case) simply because it was the only way to survive: he was forced to become \\"Another junkie plan, pushin' dope for the man\\". If wikipedia is to believe, Freddie wasn't killed directly by drug abuse: rather, it was the lifestyle that led indirectly to his death. And it's not just the lyrics that makes the song fly (no pun intended): the strings, Mayfield's falsetto, and the melody have just as much to do with it. The title track is about another drug dealer, and again it's a gripping portrait: this time, he is portrayed as a smart man forced to take up drug dealing due to lack of ambition and courage. Again, great lyrics, but it's not just the lyrics that make this one a funk landmark. Oh, no. Every element of it that you could imagine makes it a funk landmark.<br />And that's just the hits. This album is a lot deeper than that. Pusherman and Eddie, You Should Know Better are two more fascinating drug protests. Take note of the latter song: while Mayfield is critical of Eddie's drug use and dealing, he doesn't think of him as a one-sided criminal: rather, Eddie is a family man. Little Child, Runnin' Wild is a triumph of Mayfield's arranging skills; Give Me Your Love (Love Song) is approprietly romantic; Ain't No Thing on Me (Cocaine Song) is still another dead-on drug protest; and the instrumental Think is funky and exciting.<br />Superfly is an amazing album.

That's also the plot of \\"Grease,\\" and for that matter, nearly every other teen musical.<br /><br />In this case, though, I couldn't help feeling let down. Unlike the original ([[ASIN:B000F2BNW2 High School Musical (Encore Edition)]]), this film breathes not a breath of fresh air. It is, in essence, just a clone of its mama. If you loved the first film you'd like this one -- it has the same feel-good bounce -- but I bet you won't be watching it near as often.<br /><br />So why four stars? The music. It's better! \\"You Are The Music In Me\\" is a sincere, catchy duet by Gabriella and Troy (Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron) that uses a gospel chorus to rise above nearly everything ever cranked out by today's dime-a-dozen pop tarts. \\"Everyday\\" (also Gabriella and Troy) is in the same vein, a Britney-esque bouncer with a finale that seems literally straight out of a black church. \\"I Don't Dance\\" boogies along like an old big-band number, while the staccato rhythm of the boy-band rocker \\"Bet On It\\" (Troy) recalls the best of Michael Jackson. Finally, \\"All for One\\" is a hand-clapping shout-out that hints, a little, at Sheryl Crow's \\"Soak in the Sun.\\"<br /><br />By the way, if this page doesn't show you can pre-order this DVD, try this one: [[ASIN:B000VAPZM2 High School Musical 2 (Extended Edition) (2007)]].

B0001GF2DS|5.0|The Good,the Bad, and Ugly is a movie that cares nothing for critics or popularatity. This movie is based around a wonderer and bountey hunter(The Good), a heart-less bounty hunter and murderer (The Bad), and a relentless and ruthless bandit(The Ugly).          In this movie no character is good by any means; they are all bad just one has better manners. This movie is also very diffrent bacause no one speaks for much of it; however, relies on the music and facial expressions to set the tone. Might I add that this film has some of the best acting of any movie. Clint Eastwood accually has the weakest character and though is portrayed as the main character many times, he is not. Lee Van Clef play as Angel Eyes who will kill anything or anyone in his path and will sacrifice his own men for what he wants, his scenes are nothing short of awsome.  Eli Waltch steals the show as Tuco and it is very debatable that he is the main character. Every scene he is in explores how complexed he is and how close to insanity he lies. The part with his brother is particully memorable. When the movie gets going its none stop; with a perfect ballance of action and suspense. One will best the other one and then the other will better that one; which is unque in that no man is better then the others but who handles better in different situations. To the point it makes the amazing story real and fresh time after time. Make the back drop the Civil War.           If your not into westerns don't be detured, this will refuse to disapoint. Imagin a film based around a muderer, a murderer, and a murdering theif; it is great like Pulp Fiction. It's in reality what Terantino looked at when directing. The formula is simular to pulp fiction in that no one is good and it ends with the climaxing scene. The ending scene is a climax that rivals any film. The only one that competes in my opinion is Casablanca. The music score is just simply beautiful,simply the best arond.         The movie with the deleted scenes runs 3 hours, but time will fly bye like a 2 hours. By the end it will expand what stereo types are a western. Truely an astromicly incrediness film. One of three of my personally favorite movie of all time. Astounding.
0060516402|5.0|This is the most relevant, well-presented, easy-to-read research project I've seen.  The data is easily transferable to to practical use.  I have seen its implementation make a really big positive difference in groups within organizations.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Once again, Brad Paisley has come out with an album that displays his unique format of song collection.  By his tradition, his CDs contain at least 12 tracks, and lately, usually a higher number, such as 16 or more.  His most recent products contain bonus tracks such as the continuing talk show featuring the Kung Pao Buckaroos.  He manages to include an instrumental track as well as a religious song.  Of course, his CDs have sprouted about four great radio hits apiece, at least on his first four albums.  The other eight or ten tracks consist of ten \\"regular\\" country fare, many of which deserved to become popular radio hits if only the producers would have released them to the airwaves.  His latest album, \\"5th Gear\\", has fulfilled many of the characteristics above, except only two songs so far have been released for radio airplay.  This is probably because this album is still fairly new, and more will be coming over the radio in the near future.    The first of his great hits from this album is \\"Ticks\\", the 2nd track on the disc and a recent #1 hit on Billboard Magazine's Country Music Singles chart.  It begins with a high-energy thumping with fuzzy guitar sounds, and the lyrics present a humorous twist of a boy searching a girl's body for tick infestation after they have been romping in the country fields.  The next hit, \\"Online\\", the 3rd track on this disc, is currently enjoying frequent radio airplay and is climbing up the Billboard music chart.  In this modern, lively county hit, a young man shows how he distorts his stats and profile in the cyberworld through a popular networking website, so he can attract new girlfriends.  In the \\"real\\" world, he and many other users could not find dates becaues they supposedly are short, fat, geeky, drive an inexpensive car, live with their parents, or are otherwise uncool (check out the accompanying video on CMT or Brad Paisley website.)    The album begins with \\"All I Wanted Was A Car\\", a contemporary style song telling thestory of every teenage boy's dream of owning a machine that brings fun (and maybe friends and dates).  In \\"Letter To Me\\", a soft, more traditional country sound, a man writes a letter to his 17-year-old self, telling him not to despair over the unpleasant things during that time of his life (breakup with girlfriend, trouble with schoolwork), and reminding him that things will get better in the future.  In a poem sang in 3/4 rhythm, \\"I'm Still A Guy\\" the man lists the ways he see things differently than his wife or girlfriend, from a male point of view.  The next track, \\"Some Mistakes\\", has a brisk drum beat, with guitars and banjo sounds.  The singer notes that some forms of improper behavior, such as driving too fast, are so much fun (note the mention of trying to shift into 5th gear), that you should do them while you are still young, before you start thinking like your parents.  This piece ends with a fantastic instrumental section, with the variety of guitars and the drums.  \\"It Did\\", by contrast, is a ballad story of how a guy's wonderful life keeps improving with successive life events: dating, marriage, the birth of a son.  In a change of pace, \\"Mr Policeman\\", a novelty with very brisk rhythm, features a mischievous young man challenging the police to catch up with him.  A song with a very creative title, \\"If Love Was A Plane\\" is just as clever in its lyrics and gives the statistics of love's \\"failure rate\\" and compares it to airplane \\"flight failure\\", and states that people would avoid falling in love if the consequences were similar to a plane crash and they knew the odds that their love would fail (crash).    A beautiful ballad is the track, \\"Oh Love\\", sung with the help of American Idol winner Carrie Underwood, where she plays the woman in the love relationship.  This song is followed by the party song, \\"Better Than This\\".  It implies that picnics and parties and get-togethers are great fun but could be even better if celebrities showed up at the event.Another Country/Western ballad is \\"With You, Without You\\" about a man who could live regardless of whether his woman stayed with him or left him.  Fiddle and steel guitar contribute to an instrumental section at the ending portion.  \\"Bigger Fish To Fry\\" has a Western Swing rhythm and would make a great party song or dance song.  The lyrics here imply that the sins of smoking, drinking too much, cussing, laughing at dirty jokes, and causing trouble at the bar might disappoint parents but would not be noticed by the devil, for there are many worse things that people do,   that would attract the devil's attention.  In keeping with the Brad Paisley practice of having a religious song in the lineup, \\"When We All Get To Heaven\\" is included here.  This uplifting religious song has a traditional country sound and includes acoustic piano and guitar.  This is the last vocal musical track  on the album.  The final musical track is \\"Throttleneck\\", an instrumental piece featuring a variety of guitars (regular guitars and sliding steel guitars) and percussion section.  It begins at a relatively slow pace and then quickly speeds up as if somebody turned the throttle.  These instruments continue with fast picking and showcase fantastic and novel fretwork.  Towards the end, the musical instruments slow down their pace as if somebody turned the throttle again; at the very end is a brief vocal section with no musical instruments.    It is hard to predict which of thse musical tracks will eventually be released as radio hits and it is tougher to foresee which of these will become among Brad's greatest hits.  All of these musical pieces are creative and unique by their own virtues.  Any one of them has the potential to be a great hit, for all are wonderful sounding here.    There are three tracks featuring the comedy talk show with the Kung Pao Buckaroos: \\"Previously\\", the 13th track on the CD, and two \\"hidden\\" tracks, 17 and 18, which are not listed on the album jacket.  The inclusionof these talk show tidbits is one of Brad Paisley's traditions.
B00005JPFH|3.0|I felt that the main story of the movie, the corrupting influence of the alien costume and the effect it had on Peter's life and relationships, was very well done. I liked the conflict between Harry and Peter and MJ and Peter as well.    Warning - spoilers may follow.    My biggest complaint, however, was the Sandman. There was so much ruined potential with his character.   First problem with him was, he was NICE?!?! Why? What happened to evil villians? Why are they always just misunderstood people who made a mistake?   I would have liked to see Sandman as a truly evil villian (maybe an assassign or a hitman).  The movie losses one star for this.    The second star lost is also Sandman related. Why did they have to change who killed Uncle Ben? The defining moment of Spider-Man's career, what turned him into a hero in the first place, is the realization that \\"with great power comes great responsibility\\". A realization he has when he discovers that the man who killed his uncle is the very same man he let get away. This movie robs the Spider-Man legend of that pivotal moment. Given this new scenerio, whether Peter stopped the thief or not, his uncle could have ended up dead. (Plus, what seems like justice in the first movie when the carjacker falls to his death, is overkill for nothing more than a stolen car - not that I don't think car theives should be punished, just not with the death sentence.)    Now, I realize that they added this in order to give Peter a reason to become obsessed with the Sandman, but given the influence the costume was having on him, just a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Sandman could have done that.    I also don't like the way Venom was completely wasted in this movie. I would not have put Venom in it at all (Sandman alone could have given Spidey enough trouble to seek out Harry's help). Venom would have been perfect for a movie all his own (have him bond with the alien costume at the end of 3), especially given the mind games he would play with Peter in his first appearences in the comics.    In the end, this movie could have been great, but all the wasted potential and \\"nice\\" villians was infuriating.    I was tempted to give this only 2 stars, but know I will end up getting this on DVD anyway, so bumped it up one. (Like I said, what I consider the main story I liked.)
B000Q6GUT8|3.0|I like Mark Wahlberg.  I think he's a great actor.  But if you advertise it as another Bourne Identity, then you are setting the viewer's expectations.  If you set the benchmark yourself, you better deliver and this film does not.    If I had not heard about this comparison to the Bourne series, I think I would have enjoyed it as an action film, but it still wouldn't be one that I would want to own.  There are much better films out there, like the Bourne series.
1400063515|4.0|Reading a lot of the reviews, it strikes me that some people have missed Taleb's point---the book isn't really about statistics, or economics, or finance at all. It's more of a lifestyle guide---how to live in the presence of unknown unknowns. Simply put, one should be humbler about what can be known---don't fall into the obvious traps of epistemological arrogance about what can be known, or what Taleb calls the `ludic fallacy'---stop trying to fit things into a Gaussian box because things are computationally and philospohically more tractable that way, and go for things that all long odds. Most of the time you'll lose small. But when the big one comes around, you're made for life (or completely undone). One can apply this principle all over the place, the most mundane example being investments, or going on dates, or reading books, etc. Overall I enjoyed TBS, but really enjoyed Fooled by Randomness, which I think is better written. It's just as smart as TBS though. Taleb's Dynamic Hedging, btw, is the best finance book I've ever come across. I teach financial economics straight out of it to undergrads, and they get it. Personally I'd love to take a course from him. As another aside, Tabeb's site, [...] one of the ugliest on the net along with Neal Stephenson's, has some lecture notes/technical papers/podcasts/etc.
0767805712|4.0|I tend to get into these sort of deep sci fi movies.  This movie has a smart screeplay and the acting is very good.  Im no Ethan Hawke fan i assure you, I usually loathe him in movies, but he is very good in this, as is Jude Law and Uma Thurman.  The movie is fiction of course, but it really makes you think about the future and the trajectory of genetics.  If you are into sci fi at all, then i cant imagine you not really getting into this movie, everyone i know that has seen it has raved about it.  Highly recommended.
B000BNI95Y|3.0|I first heard Bebe on the Putumayo Latin Lounge album.  I always like to buy the artists' original recordings, but I must say that this one disappointed me a bit.  Too electronic and aggressive for me.  And some of the songs just keep going on and on and on... No thanks.

B00005J6UP|5.0|what can i say... this is my favorite movie from my child hood. the story is about some oregon kids who find a treasure map and go after the rich stuff to save thier houses from being destroyed by rich pricks. bottom line is that this is a amazingly fun adventure. ive played this so many times in my dvd player that i had to buy a new one! HEY YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!<br />BTW there is a short novelization of this movie for sale here on amazon which is totally worth buying and reading.
B000002O51|5.0|The most remarkable, beautiful voice in rock music. This album is a gem. Amanda, We're Ready, and Cantcha Say are 3 of the most memorable songs of the 80's. There are no words to say......
B0009U55SI|5.0|One does not usually link Fritz Reiner with the music of Gustav Mahler; however, this recording, as well as the newly re-released \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\", is quite a surprise.  The sound is spectacular and the level of interpretation is of the highest caliber.  Lisa Della Casa's contribution is wonderful.  All together, this is a glorious edition to RCA's Living Stereo Hybrid SACD series and well worth your money.
B00005JPQR|2.0|Ok, so I was very optimistic when I went to watch this movie. I enjoyed the first film in the series very much, and had read several positive reviews, so I decided to go. I was VERY dissapointed. As most of the other reviewers on this site have noted, the hand-held camera work added nothing to the story and really became a distraction. I found the plot very weak and unbelievable. I could not believe that someone supposedly as skilled as Bourne would have been so stupid as the character in the film was. I found the ending very unsatisfying. Instead of being climactic it was anti-climactic. The action sequences were way too long, and mostly did nothing to move the plot along. They seemed to be there for titillation only. Frankly, I was not that impressed.<br />I was also very distracted by the alteration in Matt Damon's appearance. Apparently he did not escape the Hollywood rush to the plastic surgeon's office, and he's put on some weight. I didn't think he was nearly as cute as he used to be. Plus, since his obvious plastic surgery(eye lift, face lift at least) his acting was very cold and he seemed to have difficulty projecting his emotions.<br />I recommend this movie only for die-hard Damon fans who won't be put off by poor filmmaking.
0307276902|4.0|James Frey is an excellent writer and this was an excellent book.  I found this book to be a real page turner.  I know that there was a cloud of controversy surrounding this book sometime back, but the degree to which he remembers or does not remember his life and experiences is truly of no consequence to me.  As with most leisure reading, I read this book to be entertained and I was...thoroughly.  This book is a very good read.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I love this CD. The music is actually even better than I thought it would be.  I highly recommend it!
B000LE0TGA|5.0|ELO may have a \\"Best of\\" CD...but this recording really has to be considered as \\"the best of\\" by itself.    It'll take you back 30 years...and, at the same time, a whole new generation can enjoy great tunes by a legendary, classic group.
0316776963|5.0|I loved this book. It was funny, smart, interesting and easy to read. This guy's mind is twisted in all kinds of weird ways, but it makes for entertaining reading. The book slows down a bit when he describes his French lessons, he goes into too much detail, but the details are funny so it's not too bad.    I definitely recommend the book - it's fabulous!
0321344758|4.0|Everyone who has any part in designing a UI should read this book. Krug outlines the essentials regarding design, hierarchy, navigation, and usability testing (perhaps the most important part of the book). The new edition also includes material on accessibility - he sounds preachier here, but for a good cause.<br /><br />The format is attractive and easily digestible, and the book is short enough to be undaunting, with relevant and colorful illustrations.<br /><br />BTW, I've found a serious flaw in the Amazon reviewer rating system. It only counts \\"helpful\\" votes ... this means that reviews (esp. for controversial books) basically become shouting matches, where people vote \\"no\\" to reviews with points of view they don't like, and vice-versa - regardless of merit or content of the review. This undermines the ratings of good reviewers who write thorough reviews of emotionally charged items.
0143038419|5.0|This is a fabulous book where the layout is very interesting. Gilbert divides her book into 3 sections of 36 short chapters each, based on the structure of \\"japa malas\\". The book describes Gilbert's spiritual and actual journey after a very difficult time in her life.    The first section tells us about her time in Italy. It corresponds to the \\"Eat\\" of the book's title and is the section that describes the pursuit of pleasure. This is the section I most enjoyed and with which I most identified.     The second section describes her time in an ashram in India, corresponding to \\"Pray\\" in the title and tells us about her pursuit of devotion. I learned a lot about the process of meditation, but for me it went into too much detail and I found it a bit slow. I think this may be because I'm comfortable with my faith (if not my religion), and not really in *search mode* about this issue.     The third and final section tells about her time in Indonesia, specifically in Bali. This section corresponds to \\"Love\\" in the title and what she describes as her pursuit of balance. This is the section of the book where she most gets out of her self and tells stories about others, it was the most narrative part of the book and I found it very entertaining.    Gilbert writes in a very conversational tone and she's very self-effacing and funny. It is an easy read of important and complex subjects.     I definitely recommend the book.
B000BCE918|5.0|These movies let us live out the fantasy that dinosaurs still roam the earth. Special effects, storyline and creativeness of the director/writer is most enjoyable. Recommend to all prehistoric reptile lovers. Acting is a bit strained and characters could have been developed more. It's like most of the attention to detail was on the dino's and special effects and actors were thrown in as backdrop/afterthought.
B00005JPQL|4.0|\\"Stardust\\" is a richly detailed fairy tale: bright, vibrant, and generally engaging, filled with characters that are equal parts action, mystery, and humor. While not a perfect film, the end result is still very entertaining; every location is bold and imaginative, and most every shot is enhanced by a series of wonderful special effects. In this sense, it was able to achieve exactly what it wanted. Nonetheless, some key areas of the film were not as developed as I had hoped, specifically with areas of plot advancement and the development of certain characters. Take, for example, the central character--a star that has fallen from the night sky. For the physical embodiment of a celestial phenomenon, she didn't seem ethereal enough. If anything, she was fairly ordinary, save for the occasional ability to emanate white light.    The star--whose name is Yvaine (Claire Danes)--is the catalyst for an otherworldly chase through magical lands. Now that a star has fallen, many are interested in finding her. The most important is our young hero, Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox), born as the result of an affair with a magical slave woman (Kate Magowan). At age eighteen, he lives a humdrum existence in late nineteenth-century England. He vies for the love of the childish, arrogant Victoria (Sienna Miller), and in doing so, he promises to find and deliver a shooting star falling towards the horizon. Of course, she doesn't take him seriously. For one thing, a wall that no one is allowed to cross surrounds their village, which is aptly named Wall; the other side is home to a world of magic. Furthermore, Victoria is set to marry another man. But she opts to toy with Tristan by giving him a week to find the star and bring it back.    As with all unlikely characters on a hero's journey, Tristan's quest will be marked by numerous encounters with opposing forces. One is Prince Septimus (Mark Strong), one of the many possible heirs to the throne of the kingdom of Stormhold. He was but one ofseven brothers, all of which were encouraged to eliminate the competition by any means necessary (when they're introduced, three of them are already ghosts). The dying king (Peter O'Toole) decides to challenge his remaining sons: whoever finds his magical gem first will be the new king. The princes must find Yvaine in order to find the gem; she obtained it after it flew through space, knocking her out of the night sky.    Another opposing force is a coven of witches, led by the delightfully wicked Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer). Apparently, the heart of a fallen star does wonders for restoring a witch's youth. Facing an eternity of looking like ancient hags, Lamia is chosen to capture Yvaine. She disguises herself by transforming into a much younger woman, which works out fine until she starts using her magic; she loses more and more of her youth with each spell.    Thus begins the race to find a fallen star, a race that will force Tristan and Yvaine to plunge into a world they've never been part of. They hate each other when they first meet, but it's pretty obvious that their feelings will change as the film progresses. She's the Damsel in Distress and he's the Daring Hero sent to save her. The two will fall in love--one should expect nothing less from a fairy tale. One should also expect nothing less in terms of side characters, most of which serve as comedy relief. The King's dead sons, for example, not only bicker, but also retain their deathly blows as ghosts: one has an axe stuck in his head, and one has a squished face from falling. Another example is a shady retailer played by Ricky Gervais; his one-liners are appropriately annoying and unfunny.    The only side character I'm not so sure about is Captain Shakespeare (Robert De Niro), the leader of a band of sky pirates (their ship is an airborne dirigible). Here's a character that puts up one heck of a façade--his reputation is that of a fierce, ruthless swashbuckler, but in reality ... well, maybe I shouldn't say anything specific. I will say that the character's true nature will come as a shock to Robert De Niro fans; he's never been in a role like this before. Whether or not it was a necessary role, I have no idea. He reveals himself to Tristan and Yvaine in a way that's comical but not necessarily appropriate for the story. It probably would have been better for Shakespeare to be a straightforward pirate character.    I have to admit that I was expecting a little more from \\"Stardust.\\" It's only as adventurous and daring as the average moviegoer expects it to be; what could have been downright enthralling is merely enjoyable. Thankfully, it is enjoyable enough for a four-star ranking, despite some glaring character flaws. I'm sure fans of Neil Gaiman's original novel will find it disappointing; the essence of the story is intact, but many of the specifics are incredibly different, with aspects that are altered, condensed, or original to the screenplay. This is to be expected, of course. Film adaptations are never completely faithful to their sources. Those who have not read the novel will obviously not care about this, and for them, \\"Stardust\\" will be fun. Not enchanting by any means, but fun nonetheless.
B0002IU988|5.0|You will forget all about Creed when you listen to this CD.  I played it for a friend of mine who loved Creed but knew nothing about Alter Bridge and he never put the two together until I told him who the band members were.  It is a great album and this band has a really good sound.  Vocals are top notch and the guitars are some of the best you will find anywhere !  I am a huge music fan of hard rock and heavy metal and I think this is one of the best CD's to come out in a very long time.  There is no doubt if you buy it, you will not be disappointed.

1594489505|5.0|Could barely bring myself to put this book down.  It is hard to explain loving a book that is so brutal in many ways.  As a woman who has always lived a free life as an American & has been minimally touched by war, there were times I could only cry for the losses these people endure.  Mr. Hosseini made me deeply care for each character not unlike  The Kite Runner.  Highly recommend this book, not one to pass up!

B000MV9026|1.0|I was thoroughly enjoying this film  until it became a lecture on the environment and pollution.  I hear enough about that in the news and on the internet and everywhere I go.

Milos Forman does great getting the most out of this cast. The costumes and sets are pleasing,The opera and concert scenes show what it was really like Mozart liked to entertain people rich and poor. Amadeus is a great film about a great likable legend, a breath of fresh air for his time.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|This is a movie targeted at FF7 lovers. You will see your favorite heroes come back from retirement and battle an old evil.    The storytelling is not particularly elaborated, and casual fans might get completely lost on the plot. It, however, has some 5 minute, fast-track, mind-refresher video of the important events in the original FF7 game.
1400034779|3.0|Our book group read this book because many of us had heard from other people that this series was really good.  I have to say that I found this book a little boring.  It's not really an ongoing plot but, instead, a series of short stories.  The solutions to the \\"crimes\\" come about by the most unrealistic coincidences and situations.  If solving cases were this easy there wouldn't be any criminals out on the streets.  One gal in our book group bought the series based on recommendations and after reading the first book gave the rest of the set to one of the ladies who liked the book.  I would say our book group consensus tallied at about 80% who didn't care for the book and 20% who did.

0345440900|5.0|This book changed my life.. for the first 8 weeks of my new baby  I thought I was going to crack up. I had read that babies shoudl sleep a lot and therefore it confused me that my little one did not. It was not because she didn't like sleeping, it was because I was not reading her cues and not knowing what to expect. This book explains it all very easily and actually it is all down to common sense.. i.e reading your baby and knowing what is wrong. As soon  as i read the book i could see where i was going wrong and as soon as i put my little pone on the recomended routine, my life changed forever.. she slept for long periods during the day, all night long and basically became a dream child. It is all about common sense and once you get over the initial hurdle of trying to find time to read the book, your life will be chnaged forever!
0060853980|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book so much in a long time. It's funny and witty and absolutely impossible to put down until the very end. It's about armageddon, an angel and demon teaming up to find a missplaced 11-year-old antichrist, the four bikers of the apocalypse, and all sorts of other funny bits. Mind you, it has very specific British humor so I can see how some people wouldn't get it, but personally I thought it was hilarious, very well written, and even managed to point out things about human nature without preaching. This book is the best of everything.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Yes, Grindhouse was the coolest movie ever. And yes, I too wish both films were released as they were theatrically. But c'mon, people!! Everybody is complaining about the individual releases, saying that they are boycotting and are not going to buy these films separately, but in the same breath you all are saying how much you love this movie and how you couldn't wait to see it on DVD. Well... here it is! So, if you all really loved it, then buy it! If not, don't. But please, do SHUT UP!!
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This is an excellent album.  Ray chose some of the world's most outstanding artists to sing with him - artists with varied styles, from country to pop to R&B.  I especially enjoyed the duets with Willie Nelson, Gladys Knight, Johnny Mathis and Norah Jones.
B00005JPKE|4.0|I won't take up your time regurgiatating some of the excellent posts regarding this film. Perhaps the most helpful thing I could say is \\"don't expect a war movie and don't expect an anti-war movie\\". I think critics who thought the film a cry for pacifism missed the point; rather it is reflection on the warrior cult and the insanity of that state of mind. Also I was glad to see that for once we are exposed to watching the American soldier susceptible to losing his moral compass as well.
B000R34V50|5.0|Quite simply, this movie looks absolutely stunning.  If you own a Blu-ray player, you must own this movie.  The HD transfer was done beautifully, and will make a great showcase for showing off the wonders of HD.      As for the movie itself, that's great too.  Having grown up with the Turtles in the 80's, this movie was a must-see.  As another reviewer mentioned, I wasn't too pleased with the scrawny look of the CGI Turtles.  But I have to hand it to them, the CGI turned out beautifully and I hope there are more Turtles movie like this one to come.  The story was sharp, entertaining, and witty.  Every TMNT fan must own this movie.

B000P7V46C|3.0|For some fans of the earlier, Gabriel-fronted Genesis the answer was \\"yes\\". Three albums into Phil Collins taking lead as vocalist and a shift was becoming clearly evident. Exit lead guitarist Steve Hackett (whose departure gave this album it's matter-of-fact title), and the progressive rock phase of Genesis's career. The shift is not so much musical, ATTW3 still sounds very much like a Genesis record, but from here on out the focus is placed on tighter arrangements and shorter songs. Only intermittently on this and future releases does the band revisit the progressive roots of it's past. ATTW3 is an uneven start for the new Genesis, yet still a worthy album for fans.     \\"Follow You, Follow Me\\", although a somewhat anti-climatic choice to close the album, is perhaps ATTW3's most important track in that it clearly foreshadowed the direction of song-writing that carried the band to huge success in the 80's. It has a simplicity and innocence without being overbearingly sappy.  Other ballads abound on the album as well (\\"Undertow\\", \\"Snowbound\\", \\"Many Too Many\\"), but don't impact quite like \\"Follow...\\".    More energetic songs provide highlights elsewhere on this album. \\"The Lady Lies\\" is lyrically intriguing with it's fairy-tale setting backed by great musical interplay by the three musicians.  \\"Deep In the Motherlode\\" has a nice driving rhythm to accompany it's tale of west-ward expansion.     This CD/DVD combination is the one to get. The new mixes are particularly revelatory as older mixes of this album always sounded muddy to my ears.  The DVD features a lengthy documentary on what it's like to put a Genesis show on tour, but the focus is more on the behind the scenes crew that make it possible than on the band and their music. An informative interview with the band does shed some light onto the songs. There are also promotional videos to watch and tour booklets to view on screen.

B00005JLWN|5.0|If you really take a good look at the film you can almost see the direction America is taking.  I have enjoyed the film because of Christian Bale.  He has such a strong presence here and with the close-up of his facial featues you can see how great of an actor he is.  I saw this film after I saw American Psycho and again its because of Christian Bale.  If you want to see another great film by him try The Machinest.  I was a little disappointed that Sean Bean did not get to play a greater part in the film.  I would have like to know more about his character.  Over all its a film worth keeping in your collections.  There's not too much talk to clutter your mind and enough thought to keep you wondering about the future.
B00005RYL2|1.0|There are cult movies that have something special about them but are just not mainstream, and then there are cult movies that are utterly awful but that some group of people loves anyway. Highlander is the second type.    Highlander creates a great fantasy scenario. An unexplained, even among its members, group of immortals is born on Earth over the ages. They have to cut off each other's heads in attempt to be the last one standing, at which point the last one will receive some sort of great prize. Interesting issues of their (semi) immortality are touched upon, such as what it's like to be with a partner and watch them grow old and die without them.     Despite the interesting premise, the real problem is three-fold: 80's cheese dogging every inch of the film when they are in the \\"current\\" day period fighting, throw away acting, sloppy set-ups for action premises, particularly the last part of the film where a relationship starts out of nowhere. It just doesn't stand up as a good film, and as I watched it I either laughed at how bad it was or kept wondering if I should just shut off and stop the terrible waste of time.

1593083246|5.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. This was the first English classic book I read while getting my University degree. Pride and Prejudice was a part of my English Literature. What began as a course syllabus, ended as a love affair with English classic, specially books by Jane Austen.<br /><br />This book strengthened by belief that love withstands everything. The characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are so excellently chalked out, that it makes us fall for them instantly. The magic of this book is amazing.<br /><br />This book lead me to buy and read all Jane Austen's classics.<br /><br />Must read for all who love to read..
B00006IRJU|5.0|Its hard to find an album with as many fabulous songs, from ANY decade. The range of songs from soft to hard does not get any better. The lyrics, vocals<br />and music is PERFECTION. The only thing wrong is that ICEHOUSE did not stay together. If you handpicked various STARS from whatever years and formed an  All-Star Band they would not even be close. I guess all the planets must have been in perfect alignment when ICEHOUSE came together as a band.<br />Solid Gold is not good enough to describe MAN OF COLORS, its PURE PLATINUM.<br />And watch your friends carefully, so the CD does not disappear as did mine,<br />because its great enough to tempt ANYONE!

It isn't rock-bottom priced, but it isn't top-tier price either.<br /><br />Rest assured, the piano playing IS top tier. I like Klien's Mozart piano even better than Brendel's, and that is no easy feat.

055358202X|1.0|George R.R. Martin turned the entire fantasy genre on it's head with [[ASIN:0553573403 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)]], the first book in the series and then, incredibly, he topped himself with the next two chapters, [[ASIN:0553579908 A Clash of Kings (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 2)]] and [[ASIN:055357342X A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)]]. A Song of Ice and Fire is widely acclaimed as the best fantasy series since Tolkien and heaps of praise are bestowed upon it, but...  With the fourth entry in the series, A Feast for Crows, Martin is either loosing steam or worse - the series is getting away from him. It has grown too large and its elephantine size threatens to bring it down into mediocriy with other series that wander aimlessly with no end in sight *cough* Wheel of Time *cough*.  Martin himself has explained that A Feast for Crows is only half the book, that is, a full story with only half the characters, and not the better half I might add. But it did not start out this way, meaning that the novel just grew too big and practical considerations forced the book to be split in two. Martin is straying from his game plan of a six book series and now who knows how long it will be. There are so many characters that even with the character index at the end (which is over 50 pages long!) one has difficulty keeping up with who's who, much less what they're up to, who they're related to and what part they play in the ever more bloated plot. After reading A Feast for Crows one feels like when one sees one of those long, boring French movies, the end comes and you don't know what the whole thing was about in the first place.  The book was sorely missing a proper editor, at least HALF of the novel could have been jettisoned and nobody would have missed it. The bare bones story was stretched to close to 1000 pages in which nothing much happened other than endless traveling from here to there. The Sansa and Arya chapters were especiallypointless, the Brienne chapters were just plain boring, leaving us with only Cersei and Jaime and a few other chapters that were up to par with the rest of the series.  Hopefully we won't have to wait as long for A Dance With Dragons (the next chapter) as we did for this installment and also I sincerely hope that the story moves FORWARD and Mr. Martin does not succumb to never-ending-series-itis. And yes, I will read the next book in spite of my disappointment because since I've come this far I may as well.
B000P46QTA|5.0|Made on a shoestring budget of $2 million, The Lives of Others is the most suspenseful psychological thriller I've seen in a long time, ranking with Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation and John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate. What's more, it presents one of the strongest pro-individual, anti-collectivist themes of any movie I've ever seen--all the more surprising because it hails from, of all places, Germany.     Its key lies in its title, which seems at first glance drippingly altruistic. The year, appropriately, is 1984, and Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is in his twentieth year as an agent of East Germany's dreaded Ministry for State Security, commonly known as \\"Stasi.\\" The \\"shield and sword\\" of the Socialist Unity Party, 100,000 Stasi agents and 200,000 paid informers hold the small Soviet satellite nation in a death grip, monitoring and controlling the lives of its 17 million citizens.     Captain Wiesler is a meticulous interrogator, ruthlessly wearing down suspects until they confess. An instructor at the Stasi academy, he trains future agents always to be on guard. \\"The best way to establish guilt or innocence is non-stop interrogation,\\" he instructs his students. \\"The enemies of the state are arrogant. Remember that. \\"     A humorlessly menacing man, Wiesler leads a lonely, Spartan existence in an antiseptic, sparsely furnished apartment in a concrete high-rise that houses many fellow agents. One day at the academy, his former classmate and current boss, gregarious Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), drops in with an assignment right up Wiesler's alley. One of their artists appears to be straying from the flock, and Wiesler has been assigned to watch him. However, the subject in question is no dissident, but the most celebrated playwright in East Germany, Georg Dreymann (Sebastian Koch)--a citizen so loyal to the Party that he believes his is \\"the greatest country on earth.\\"     Later that evening, spying from a balcony seat withopera glasses, Wiesler detects the mark of subversiveness on Dreymann's face as he watches the actors onstage performing his play. As Georg beams with proprietary approval, rising to applaud, Wiesler quietly utters to himself a one-word indictment that seals the dramatist's fate: \\"Arrogant.\\"     Georg lives with longtime companion Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck)--a radiant brunette who is as celebrated an actress as Georg is a writer (and to whom Wiesler clearly takes a fancy). While they are out of their flat, Wiesler's technical team descends upon their home, bugging the place. \\"Operation Lazlo\\" is now in full swing, and Wiesler and his partner monitor their subjects around the clock from the apartment building's empty attic.     At first, the surveillance of Georg and Christa appears fruitless. At a dinner party they host, a hysterical theatrical colleague (Hans-Uwe Bauer), who's suffered detention and psychological torture at Berlin's infamous Hohenschönhausen prison, accuses another director of being a Stasi informer. Georg is quick to defend the man against the accusation.     Yet, through the course of his work, Wiesler makes some rather ugly discoveries about the investigation. He learns that it was ordered at the behest of national Culture Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), a porcine bureaucrat who's extorted sexual favors from Christa under the threat of blacklisting her. Wiesler also eventually finds his friend Grubitz's schmoozing to be a cover for vicious social climbing and discovers that Grubitz is complicit with Hempf's scheme to use Stasi as a cat's paw to eliminate Georg, his romantic rival.     Within Wiesler stirs a realization previously kept repressed: that his unquestioning faith in his country has enabled not his ideal of the perfect socialist state, but the hideous arrogance of avaricious thugs who run everything in the \\"workers' utopia.\\"     Where once was the heel-clicking impersonality of a robot, a conscience begins to grow. Wiesler comes to view Georg and Christa and their circle of bohemian friends not as specimens under a microscope, but as real individuals, with hopes and dreams, loves and heartbreaks. Having grown a conscience, he soon also yearns for a heart, as he silently assesses the utter emptiness of his own life.     Swept up in his subjects' personal lives, Wiesler's detached spying turns into voyeurism. But it isn't a perverted voyeurism, because, for the first time, the lonely captain catches a glimpse into a world of beauty, poetry, and music that is alien to his two-dimensional existence. Sympathetic to the predicament of these enemies of the state, Wiesler begins covering for them, faking his reports, and remaining silent about Georg's gradual disillusionment with the DDR after an old director friend (Volkmar Kleinert) commits suicide.     He overhears an argument in which Georg confronts Christa with knowledge of her affair with Hempf. Christa--already insecure about her talent--explains that she fears being blacklisted if she breaks it off. Wiesler feels compelled to protect her: He accidentally-on-purpose runs into her in a bar, pretending to be a fan, and tells her that her performances have inspired him. \\"Many people love you for who you are,\\" he says, sincerely. \\"You are even more yourself onstage than you are in real life.\\"     Christa dismisses his compliment, telling Wiesler he can't really know her. \\"Did you know that I would sell myself for art?\\" she asks. \\"But you already have art,\\" he counters. \\"That would be a bad deal; you're a great artist.\\"     Though his simple compassion, he gives Christa the strength to believe in herself and renounce her extorted affair with Hempf. But in doing so, Wiesler unintentionally sets into motion a nail-biting series of events that leads inexorably both to tragedy and redemption.     The Lives of Others is a superb film, top-drawer in every regard. Cathartic and ennobling, it recalls Fahrenheit 451 and We the Living in itspresentation of tragic heroes forced to examine their deepest-held yet deeply mistaken principles. Hagen Bogdanski's cinematography is compelling; through subtle differences in lighting he gives Silke Buhr's sets an additional dimension that places the characters in emotional context. Shot with tungsten-balanced film, Georg and Christa's incandescently-lit apartment radiates warmth; yet by capturing with daylight film the omnipresent, fluorescent-lit settings of the Stasi world, Bogdanski renders it cold and bloodless. Gabriel Yared's simple, haunting soundtrack is the perfect evocative counterpart for the action onscreen.     The acting is realistic, but never naturalistic. Martina Gedeck is a pleasure to watch, not merely because of her physical beauty, but for her impressive emotional range. Ulrich Tukur's capacity to turn on a dime from regular guy to cold-blooded manipulator is simply scary. And Sebastian Koch combines a physically imposing presence with a gentle, almost fatherly manner, reminding me of a younger Rutger Hauer.     But Ulrich Mühe steals the show as Wiesler. I have never seen an actor convey such a broad range of feelings within such narrow parameters. Where a Pacino or a Steiger would explode with ferocity, Mühe underplays, moving the audience with the sudden shift of an eyebrow, the drawing-in of a cheek muscle, or the quiet fall of a teardrop that betrays his sphinx-like façade.     Mühe began his acting career in communist East Germany. When government records were opened to the public after German reunification, he learned that his actress wife had been informing on him to the Stasi during the entire six years of their marriage. Clearly, he drew upon this reservoir of traumatic betrayal for this role.     The Lives of Others is flawlessly crafted, completely engaging the heart and mind. Most impressive is the fact that it's Henckel von Donnersmarck's feature film debut, released while he was still at the relatively young age of 32. In arecent interview, von Donnersmarck--who saw life behind the Iron Curtain first-hand when he visited family in East Germany as a child--spelled out his thoughts on communist repression as well as independent filmmaking:     \\"The [phrase] 'Independent film' makes sense to me only if it means that the director has full artistic control. How could a film be independent otherwise? ... I know that very well from East Germany: Until the Wall came down, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat had Final Cut on everything: novels, plays, films, even paintings. Make no mistake: hardly ever did they actually censor anything. But looking back at the art of those four decades, you can still feel the state in everything, and most of the art of that era is very impersonal and boring. Because the artists censored themselves, often without knowing it.\\"     Imagine my surprise, then, when the PC crowd at the recent Academy Awards ceremony--who feted environmental scam-artist Al Gore for his global warming crock-umentary--also bestowed the Best Foreign Language Film award upon The Lives of Others, rather than upon heavily favored Pan's Labyrinth. (I think Lives deserved the nod for Best Motion Picture overall, but I'm not unhappy that the Academy gave that award to director Martin Scorsese's The Departed, a consolation prize for snubbing him so many years.)    This cinematic masterpiece is a cause for celebration. Rarely has a filmmaker burst on the scene in such total command of his material. As a directorial debut, The Lives of Others belongs in the same company as Orson Welles's Citizen Kane. I can only hope that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has a Touch of Evil yet to come.
B000RC2EH8|5.0|I passed on seeing this one in the theater, but I bought it for my kids. Its a computer generated movie, has a few recognizable voices (Chris Evens, Larry Fishbourne, Sarah Michele Gellar, etc), and its actually a lot different (better) than I thought it would be. I wont spoil it, but its a good storyline. The only negative thing I can say is that I didnt like the way Splinter's voice didnt match the character. It wasnt terrible, just not great.    Bottomline, the kids loved it... three times now, and it looked outstanding on my 720p telly. Its certainly kid oriented, but I found it easy to sit through as well. Recommended.

Randy Crawford has a phenomenal voice and with Joe Sample (one of my favorite artists') on piano and the precision playing of the other musicians on this cd,  the combination and culmination is un-beatable. There is a \\"deliciously unique arrangement\\" to each song, that was obviously, carefully hand-picked for this cd. These songs cover a wide variety of emotions and moods and I just can't seem to get enough of hearing them. What a fantastic way to relax and unwind.   I originally purchased \\"Feeling Good\\" for the track, \\"Rio De Janiero Blue\\",(which is a great tune), but I have since fallen in love with the entire cd. The first time I listened to, \\"End of the Line\\", \\"But Beautiful\\", and When I Need You\\", I got goose bumps. When I hear the track \\"See Line Woman\\", (which I find to be such a cute, sassy tune), I want to jump up and dance!  Trust me, you too, will experience much listening  Pleasure when you play this cd. You'll be \\"Feeling Good\\"!

B0000009RT|5.0|I first heard Zappa and the Mothers of Invention when I borrowed this double album set from a friend.  It belonged to his sister who was away at college.  I was 16 or 17 years old.  I liked this but at the time, I really didn't have a full appreciation for what this monumental release was all about.  Freak Out! is an incredible work of art.  It's a comment on shallow  American culture and a send up of the ridiculous values we are taught, especially in high school.  What we have here is nothing less than art reflecting society.<br /><br />This is one of the more important recordings of the 20th century.  No foolin'!  Countless musicians have been influenced (deeply) by Freak Out!<br /><br />Recorded in 1965 and released in 1966.  You've got to be kidding me (I know you aren't).  This music was so far reaching, so far ahead of its time.  Unreal.  I hadn't heard Freak Out! for a good 30 years or so and when I popped this gem into the car player I found myself listening with new ears.  Now what do I mean by new ears?  During the years in-between I discovered Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, Stravinsky, Bartok, and so on.  That's what I mean.<br /><br />Back when I was 17 years old, while I liked the music (mostly for its humor) I did not have the background for a full understanding of what was going on.  Now I do.  Freak Out! is definitely in my top 10 list of all time favorites along with Filles de Kilamajaro, Kind of Blue, A Love Supreme, Bitches Brew, Ah Em, and Out to Lunch - that's some really serious company.<br /><br />If you are serious about the way you listen to music you simply must have a copy of Freak Out!<br /><br />There is one thing I'm unsure about, my memory has become fuzzy with age... I could swear that \\"Return of the Son of the Monster Magnet\\" was much longer on the vinyl release.  Am I mistaken?  Please leave a comment if you know the answer.
B000FFJYCU|3.0|I saw this film at the theater in 1966. I am also aware of how this movie was shot; the production crew followed the Grand Prix Formula One circuit. The plot and dialogue are weak, but the race scenes are top of the line for their time. This could almost be considered an historical piece as this type of racing is gone; the movie itself was \\"state of the art\\" for 1966. I still found it enjoyable.
B0000009SI|4.0|Look, I have to be objective here.  I'm a big Zappa fan.  I especially love his work with the original Mothers (ALL of it) and the work he did with his big band (Waka Jawaka, Grand Wazoo, Imaginary Diseases) as well as the Roxy and Elsewhere band.  All of those aforementioned CDs get 5 stars in my reviews - some I would give 100 stars if I could.  The ONLY reason I'm not giving Apostrophe (') 4.5 stars is it just isn't as good as the aforementioned material... but it IS good and worth adding to your collection.<br /><br />Apostrophe (') is good fun and there is some great music here.  But let's be honest, this release was used to finance more serious works by Zappa.<br /><br />Yellow Snow and Nanook Rubs it are funny the first couple of listens.<br /><br />St Alphonzo and Father Oblivion is at once humorous and very good music<br /><br />Excentrifugal Forz is one of the high-lites but it is very short<br /><br />Apostrophe (') is a great jam with Jack Bruce but it's just a jam, there's no serious writing here.<br /><br />Cosmik Debris is another favorite and a indictment of new age mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />Uncle Remis is a great commentary on the loss of focus and priorities when it comes to civil rights (whoa, are we movin' to slow?  I can't wait 'til my 'fro is full grown - and so on and so forth)<br /><br />Stink Foot falls into the same category as Yellow Snow and Nanook.<br /><br />So yeah, this is a good Zappa CD.  Is it essential?  I guess that depends on what you are looking for in a Zappa release.  It's good fun but the music simply isn't as good as that found on Roxy and Elsewhere, Waka Jawaka, Uncle Meat, Freak Out! and so on and so forth.<br /><br />4.5 stars<br /><br />BY THE WAY:  Dweezil's Zappa Plays Zappa band is playing material from this release.  Last night I saw this band and it was FLAT OUT AMAZING!  Cosmik Debris and Uncle Remus (with Ray White singing!) were included in the very generous 2.5 hour set.  If Zappa Plays Zappa comes to your town, for God's sake, GO SEE THEM!  You will not be disappointed as this show rivaled the concert I saw in March 74 with Zappa and his Roxy and Elsewhere Mothers.  Dweezil's band REALLY IS THAT GOOD!cert I saw in March 74 with Zappa and his Roxy and Elsewhere Mothers.  Dweezil's band REALLY IS THAT GOOD!
0425210480|4.0|Where else but in the NUMA case files can you learn about giant rogue waves, whirlpools, the magnetic poles of the earth, electromagnetic warfare, and dwarf wooly mammoths all in the same book?  I love the odd combinations of topics that we always get in Clive Cussler's books.  Plus two characters travel to Los Alamos, New Mexico, a place dear to my heart. Fun!<br /><br />While this story is a Kurt Austin adventure, I hardly see any difference yet between Kurt and Dirk Pitt.  Maybe Kurt will evolve into his own person over time, but we're not there yet.  Kurt's sidekick is similarly identical to Dirk's sidekick Al Giordino.  So if you don't pay too much attention to names, this story feels just like a Dirk Pitt story.<br /><br />At 571 oversized novel pages, this book could have been tightened up a little to help keep things moving along.... the story builds slowly, with some plot pauses along the way to a climax that is far too abrupt.  It almost feels like the authors ran out of steam or hit a pre-determined page limit and had to wrap things up too quickly.  Still enjoyable light reading if you like adventures that are semi-realistic but not as serious as a Tom Clancy book.
0385522401|3.0|Admittedly, I am not an Ian McEwan \\"groupie.\\"  Disclaimer accomplished.  For me, as a writer, On Chesil Beach was a poignant short story which McEwan force fed into an alleged novel by filling the middle with unnecessary, overindulgent verbiage.  On the plus side, he executed his usual skill at demonstrating how an ordinary instance in an ordinary life can alter that life irrevocably.  He accomplishes this with a poignancy that places us inside the skin of the character(s) causing us to simultaneously experience their dilemma.   Would have made a nice \\"New Yorker\\" story in 6 pages.  Wait for the paperback.
0143038419|5.0|Splendid!!! I loved it! I laughed out loud and at times cried it was so moving. I'm buying this for a few friends. I highly recommend it.
0151013047|1.0|The writing is taut and crisp, the novel flows smoothly and succeeds in holding your interest. Thats the only positive thing I can say about this book. The writer talks about politics and the destruction wrought by America(according to him) throughout the world, but his understanding of politics is no better than a man on the street in Pakistan or India, the usual tiring left wing rant against American Imperialism, global domination etc etc. If you hold those views, you might sympathize with the author.<br />  In December 2002, some armed terrorists attacked India's parliament. India claims they were supported and financed by Pakistan. A strong response by India led to the possibility of an armed confrontation between India and Pakistan. Both the countries amassed millions of troops across the border(though India began the troop movement first). America played a generally constructive role in defusing the crisis by pressurizing both India and Pakistan to tone down the rhetoric. The authors interpretation of this episode is that America tacitly encouraged India to coerce and threaten Pakistan. This is wrong and a hysterical interpretation. It is also banal and cheap, I would have expected better from a Princeton educated writer.<br />  The author says he shook with rage when America invaded Afganisthan(among other reasons),because Afganisthan was a 'fellow Muslim' country. Why this tribalism? Does he not see the reasons why America invaded Afganisthan? I am not going over the reasons myself.( I should have used the phrase 'the main character of the novel' instead of  'the author' in this review, but there are reasons to believe that the authors views are not that different). I could go on writing, but, in summary, this book is an anti American rant and (mind you) it is a crude, cheap anti American rant, not a sophisticated one. I can cite several books on \\"American Imperialism\\" which are better written or more carefully argued than this book(not that I bought the arguments in those books, but it could be worth reading to know about the debate). The opinions of the main character of this book are so stereotypical and lacking in any sense of complexity, that I  doubt anyone should want to waste their time reading drivel like this.<br />  The authors initial reaction to September 11th was to be 'remarkably pleased' because somebody had so visibly brought America to her knees.(Pg 72). Really? I am ready to utilize my meagre savings to buy him a ticket back to Pakistan. I am surprised that a book like this has been shortlisted for the 'Booker Prize'. It seems that for some European liberals, being anti American(even in the most predictable and banal ways)is more important than literary merit.I bought the arguments in those books, but it could be worth reading to know about the debate).

B0002W0ZVK|5.0|This is a soundtrack to the documentary \\"Elvis That's the Way It Is.\\" The album was a modest hit when it was released in 1970 peaking at 21 on the US album chart (number 8 on the US Country chart) and 12 in the UK.  It would be certified GOLD by the RIAA.  The documentary covered Elvis' concerts in Las Vegas. It includes both live recordings from the show and \\"studio rehearsal\\" recordings.  It includes the US hit single \\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\\" and the UK hit single \\"I Just Can't Help Believin'\\".  While it is a little lite on the number of songs included (it is just a reissue of the LP) it is still an excellent collection and a must for Elvis fans.  Elvis is in top form for these recordings.
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority Report is a spectacular science fiction masterpiece directed by the great Steven Spielberg and loosely adapted from a short story by Philip K. Dick, one of the fathers of the cyberpunk genre. The movie shows us a world filled with dazzling technology but tells a personal story of a man who is betrayed by the system he worked for. There's plenty of action throughout the film but there's also some philosophy to make you think for hours after the end.    Minority Report is set in Washington, in the year 2054 and it's a great time to live in. The world has changed considerably and advanced technology pervades every aspect of life. Moving pictures draw your attention to every ad and poster. Holograms enable you to live out your wildest fantasies. Mag-lev vehicles ensure that 'car accidents' are a thing of the past. Retinal scanners are everywhere and the cops have jetpacks so the potential criminal has nowhere to run. In fact there hasn't been a single murder in Washington for six years thanks to a group of psychics who see every murder that's going to happen in the future. The police arrest these would-be criminals and place them in suspended animation. It's a good thing the system can't be tampered with and the precogs are never wrong.    At least that's what John Anderton the chief of police thinks until the precogs show him killing someone he doesn't even know. He must use all of his skills to escape and outwit the now-hostile system and find out the truth about the precogs, the conspiracies and his own destiny. All the actors give great performances, especially Tom Cruise and Samantha Morton.    Can we make choices that change our destiny or is the future inevitable. Is it fair to imprison someone for a crime they didn't commit...yet? Is this a worthy price to pay to maintain a murder-free society? Minority Report will give you a lot to think about and its engrossing mystery will keep you engaged until the very end. However, it is not a happy movie and somescenes are very heartbreaking so stay away if you don't like that sort of thing.
B000J3Q8U4|5.0|What makes this film a visual sensual delight is that it has some of the best glamor/beauty cinematography ever committed to film. You can watch this with your lover and it'll start the sparks flying.<br /><br />It's definitely the best of the films, and the most closely in tone with the literary source material.
B000NVT0RU|3.0|Really, that's all it is.  I could go on, but i really don't need to because all it takes is about 10 minutes of film time & you too can predict pretty much every remaining minute of the film.  Take a few hard-boiled caricatures, give them a historical time & place in which injustice still burns (bonus points for the politically correct \\"Muslims are brave & selfless but Western Whites are gutless oppressors\\" theme), then sprinkle with at least a good dozen war movie cliches that even pre-teens have seen a hundred times.  Let stand 10 minutes, then serve, while acting like no one has ever seen Saving Private Ryan.  Voila!
1400034779|5.0|Like many others, I refuse to call this a mystery or detective novel. Botswana is indeed the success story of Africa. Blessed with money (diamonds) plus enlightened, honest leadership, Botswana is slowly moving into the modern world in a way the rest of Africa can only envy. McCall Smith has presented us with a wonderful portrait of a calm and dignified people, in the person of Precious Ramotswe and her friends. The stories of crimes solved are clever, sometimes end with a twist, and are utterly charming. And McCall Smith is a wonderful writer--I almost cried at the end over the beautiful scene with Precious and her friend J.L.B. Matekoni, and he manages to bring this dusty beautiful land (which I have visited) to life. I certainly plan to read more in the series, and can only hope they live up to the wonderful promise of the first.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Wonderful movie of the author Beatrix Potter.  I loved her stories as a child and was pleased with this film of her life, many events unknown to me.  It was delightful.
0521397812|5.0|I taught adult EFL in Poland this summer, and this book was the most popular by far with all the teachers. Even if you don't use an activity straight out of the book, flipping through helped me generate ideas of my own. Yes, it very much depends on your students, class size, level, etc.--but what's new about that? The activities range from the true quickie \\"filler\\" to sound ideas on practicing grammar points. And yes, I did have to adapt most of the ideas, but that's nothing new either. It's pricey, but I think worth it.
0345350499|5.0|I have read the book more than once, which is quite a feat if you look at the size of it. Upon each time, I discover that I have learned more and see how such relates to an other. The book is so well writen and researched that, though it is fiction I find myself believing in every word.
B000OVLBEO|3.0|Having never read the comics, not being a fan of comics in general, I didn't really know what to expect from \\"Ghostrider\\". The only thing I knew was that he looked pretty cool and I liked his chopper.<br /><br />Johnny Blaze, (Cage), sells his soul to the devil in return for his father's health. Satan being Satan interprets the deal extremely literally and does what he does best: shafts Blaze, (both of them). Johnny becomes a famous stunt rider and has to answer the call to become the Devil's Ghostrider, a sort of contract-bound bounty hunter.<br /><br />The premise is very good and the whole anti-hero thing works well, although unlike the \\"Spiderman\\" movies, the whole characterisation was not explored so deeply in this movie. The story itself is relatively predictable, which also detracts a little from the movie itself. It can be hoped that these will develop in later installments, (if they are forthcoming), as they did with \\"Spiderman\\". This would make Ghostrider a very cool superhero.<br /><br />The special effects are excellent, as one would expect from such a movie, and they alone make the movie worth seeing. The special features of this package of the DVD are also in depth and relatively interesting. I particularly liked the history documentary about the comic books, which was a nice filler for one who has never heard of them before.<br /><br />Overall, this is pretty good package and one that I would recommend with some reservations. The movie did not \\"wow\\" me, and lacked some of that \\"X\\" factor that makes movies really cool. There was something missing from it, perhaps lack of character exploration and excessive predictability. However, I did enjoy it and it is possible it will grow on me later.
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|I was lucky to be able to obtain the DVD a few years back, just a few months after it was available to the public.  I never thought the movie would be that good.  I thought it would only be a good piece merely to pass the time. To my surprise, I must have watched it a hundred times or more.  I just love the actors, the accompanying music, the songs, the story, the acting. I just love everything about this movie.  My sincere salute to the \\"Director\\" of the movie!  He's just great.  I would not hasitate to look for his other movies (if any).  BTW, this is my second DVD for this movie.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|I was singing Dogs in the shower the other day after watching an episode of Miami Ink. I'd always toyed with the idea of getting a tattoo, but I never honestly thought of anything to put on myself permanently.    Then it hit me: \\"the girl that does yoga\\".    A girl doing yoga, dressed all in white with angel wings, with a rootless tree (heh heh) with an orange hanging off it, and below it a banner saying \\"learn to let go\\".    Yes, I really love Damien enough to have a part of my body devoted to him.    The first I'd ever heard by him was 9 Crimes. It was Grey's Anatomy season 2, and I was in the deepest throes of obsession with the show. The song perfectly fit the scene, and it got to the point where I stopped paying attention to the show and got lost in the beauty of the music. At that instant, I knew I had to have the song. I looked it up online, downloaded it, and listened to nothing but 9 Crimes for an entire week.    During that time I bought both of his albums, and after 9 Crimes got old (well, not old, but I wanted to branch out), I listened to the rest. O was first; I sank into the utter beauty of classics like The Blower's Daughter, Delicate, Volcano, Cannonball, and above all, Amie.    9 came next.    At first I couldn't get nearly as much into the album as I could with O, but two songs still stood out in my mind: 9 Crimes and Rootless Tree. The latter grabbed my attention and still hasn't let go, nearly a year later. Rootless Tree remains one of the best songs I have ever heard; such despair, beauty, absolute craftsmanship in a field of music that has been overly stagnated by talentless artists.    ANYWAY. Yes. I really, really, REALLY love Rootless Tree.    Dogs remains my favorite right now; delicate, beautiful, quaint, and yet the flowering chorus section gets me every.single.time. The lyrics are amazing; they convey a story, yet manage to fit perfectly in with the rhythm and feel of the song. It's truly just a work of absolute beauty.    Elephant is... indescribable. I had a very long period of obsession with this song; I fell in love with its minimalist charm and blossoming into the somewhat disturbing yet incredibly beautiful climax. Adoration.    I've had my fair share of obsession with this album; almost every song has been a favorite at one point or another, and there are several that I'm sure will stick with me for years to come. Not just any artist is tattoo-worthy, but Damien Rice certainly is.

1400063515|4.0|NNT's book about extremely improbable events and their outsized effect on our lives, is worth the price. For anyone who reads constantly, this 366 page $27 book is about a 3 day effort, at most. It's entertaining and mildy useful. You'd better realize that the stock market is a large casino. All we are doing is gambling, nothing else, since we can't even enumerate all of the risks, let alone assign correct values to them. We \\"don't know what we don't know\\". The worst of situations. For that fact alone, I recommend the book as worth reading.    Taleb's introduction of a fictional Nero (and that other female character whose name escapes me) seems like a foray into novel writing. Taleb is indeed a polymath, he's mastered nine languages and multiple sciences. People operating with that level of intellect tend to realize early in life that they are way more intelligent than the rest of us \\"American Idol\\" viewers. The next obvious step is for a person like that is serious academic research. Taleb has succeeded at that, too, holding various professorships in Mathematics around the globe. They often say to themselves, \\"Hey, I'm way smarter than these people, what can I conquer next\\"? They inevitably try writing. Every person wants to write the great American novel. This isn't it, but Taleb seems to use his extensive knowledge of various subjects to experiment in the field. I'd like to echo M. Strong's review from July 23rd, \\"Taleb the thinker deserved a far better writer than Taleb the author.\\"    I purchased this book for the insight of the Gaussian Bell curve hypocrisy I was taught in undergrad. I tend to believe and trust Taleb's assertions, but have a few questions of my own.    1. Black Swan events are stated to have shocking consequences for all of us. The classic example is the 911 disaster. Were we all totally shocked and thus exposed to a classical Black Swan? I suspect to the people that planned it, it was no shock or Black Swan at all. I submit to you that a Black Swan is a relativistic concept. Subjective, not objective. Your financial Black Swan may be a mere inconvenience to me, and vice versa.    2. Gray Swans are introduced later in the book. Less catastrophic, and less clearly defined. They need more rigorous study.    3. Mandelbrot's Fractal geometry won't help you on the market. But then again, very little will, either. It makes no predictions. Why would it? If there ever was a reliable sure-fire way to make money, then that information would be disseminated at the speed of light and everyone would know about it. But how can we all make money at the same time? Where are all the people we are to make money from, when everyone knows the sure-fire technique (fundamentals, technical analysis?). The answer is of course, is that there is no such technique. It's emotion driven. Mostly speculation.  Good luck!  -jeff

0800141660|5.0|This film adaptation of Jane Austen's SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is beautifully directed by Ang Lee [well known for films like EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN and THE WEDDING BANQUET].  What's more, Emma Thompson won a well-deserved Academy Award for her adaptation of the novel into a wonderfully witty and sensitively orchestrated screenplay.  The ensemble is wonderful.  This includes Kate Winslet as the \\"Sensibility\\" half of the sisters and Emma Thompson as the \\"Sense.\\"  The story examines the plight of the Dashwood family, a unit of four woman who are displaced by their lack of inheritance and must find their way outside of the box that convention and social standing places around them as barriers.  Whoever thinks that Jane Austen films [or her novels, for that matter] are \\"chick\\" oriented needs to watch this film and they will have a different perspective.  For starters, Ang Lee's direction is beautiful, sensitive, and captures a wonderfully engaging quality to the whole story that is intriguing and lovely for PEOPLE to watch. Highly reccomended.
0142407380|5.0|Both my 15 and 11 year old sons read the Alex Rider book series and they loved Ark Angel the best out of all the books so far.  They are already asking for me to pre-order the next book.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|I remember seeing this film on the big screen, when it was first released in 1996.  I was on a total Jane Austen kick.  I think I saw just about every film adaptation of her novels (with the exception of PERSUASION), and was looking forward to how this version would fare.  I am happy to say that Gwyneth Paltrow embodies the title character of Emma charmingly.  The upperclass matchmaker [and mischiefmaker] proceeds to set people up, shake up naysayers around her and has her share of misadventures.  This film will make you smile and is very cleverly executed, and the supporting cast (James Cosmo, Greta Scacchi, and Alan Cumming, among others) are strong and play off of Paltrow's spritely and fiesty Emma delightfully.  What's more, cinematographically, this film was shot like a beautiful English landscape and glows with life.  Lovely......
B00003CY5J|5.0|The Score is a perfect heist movie, because it brings in a lot of character development along with some good, human drama.  Robert De Niro stars as a man who is good at taking scores.  He is not just good at his craft, he is the best around.  Robert plays this character with perfection as a man who is meticulous, methodical and all business.  He never takes a big risk until one happens to present itself from his friend.  Soon there are multiple snags and setbacks that would scare off most amateurs, but again this man is the master of what he does, and that includes some mind games.<br /><br />Enter Edward Norton, playing the part of the man on the \\"inside\\" of the big job.  Norton is superb in his character play of a mentally handicapped janitor at the facility where everything is going to take place.  He also brings out the youth and arrogance that his characters needs to be the opposite of the man Robert plays, and that sets the stage for some tense moments at the end of the film.<br /><br />The humanity is the frustration of the person who is setting up the score, a man who knows his life is perhaps over if things do not go well.  None other than the legendary Marlon Brando plays this character.  De Niro's character also has a choice between a final take and a new life with a new love, a theme that is very similar to the one his character played in the 1995 Heist style film called \\"Heat\\" directed by Michael Mann.<br /><br />The film has great action as well as breathtaking moments, whether it is high tech surveillance or the snatch and go itself, The Score plays out with some nice surprises till the very end.  With an excellent cast and strong direction, it finishes out as a very tight, character driven film.

0790729342|5.0|So it is the future and gasoline is like gold.  Well this is obviously dated because when I fill up now I feel like I am paying a gold bar for a tank.  Besides that, most of the places now do not allow you to pump and then pay, because so many people are stealing from the pumps.  They call these \\"Driveoffs\\" and we need a guy like the one Gibson plays in this movie to chase them down!      The nice thing is in this movie is that on these roads you do not have to worry about a speed limit.  So yeah, sorry peoples but the radar detector you just got would be worthless in this film.      The part that is not realistic is of course the roads themselves.  C'mon peoples everywhere you go they are always having detours due to construction and road repair, in reality if this kind of thing played out, you would get a flat tire from all the potholes and debris that would fill up on the road over time.  I mean really where are the streetsweepers?  You have to be realistic even in a Science Fiction environment, but hey no problem, it is still good.
0975309331|4.0|GET THIS BOOK!!!  The content for this book is absolutely amazing.  The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the format of the book is lacking.  There are no real paragraphs.  The points are numbered. In most of the chapters, these points are started on a new line - but not in all of them.  The entire text is single spaced.  Also, the cover is fuzzy.      However - the content is brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant.  What he talks about is the foundation for and the science behind The Secret and Think And Grow Rich.  He explains it systematically and clearly.  It takes out the mystery of how we get what we have in our lives.  This information is practical and mind-boggling in it's simplicity. I have 'manifested' so much since reading this.  It demands clarity of intent and purpose. What I got out of it is that it really requires that you are clear on what you want (often easier said than done) and that you take action.  There are exercises in the book - simple ones. Not easy - simple.

I guess if you want to see this guy get it on with her that is fine, but really people it is scary that they are watching you know?

From the second I started reading this I did not want to put it down. I really can't describe in words how it made me feel, but once you read it I know you will feel it too. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer and definately knows how to get to your heart.

B000001FOL|4.0|This is a great starting point for anyone intrigued with Nico's vocals on \\"The Velvet Underground & Nico\\" and wants to hear more from her. The musical arrangements consist largely of finger picked guitar layered with various string and flute arrangements and they serve the atmosphere of her melancholy vocals quite nicely. Very enjoyable if you like Nico's voice.
B000002B30|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is probably one of my favorite all-time musicians ever!!!!    His sound is just so unique.  This CD is perfect.  All his great hits on one CD.  I listen to this all the time - in fact, it's probably going to get worn out.      If you love (classic) Rock-n-Roll, you'll love this Springsteen collection of great songs like Glory Days, My Hometown and my all time favorite hit - Born to Run.
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|I bought this album with great expectations since Kelly's career has been so successful over the past few years. Her debut album \\"Thankful\\" and her second Album \\"Breakaway\\" were nothing less than amazing... however, \\"My December\\" is , in my opinion, definitely not one of her finer artistic compilations. The music drowns out her lyrics so much that you can barely make out what she's singing about. Add to the fact that every song is so angry that her talented vocal skills are not showcased in the least on this album, leaving much to be desired after being blown away by her beautiful ballads on her past albums. I was pretty disappointed with this album... in fact, I only listened to it once through and it's been sitting under my carseat untouched for the past 6 weeks.
B000M5B6Q0|4.0|I love the music from this movie.......  The songs really do sound like a throw-back to the 80's.  There are also some nice little current tracks that have a real hip sound to them.  Glad I bought the CD; I've listened to it several times already.  Also, if you are a Hugh Grant fan - it's a must for your collection - he has a decent voice for a non-singer.  I think he did a great job!!

B000056H24|5.0|\\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" is one of my favorite biblical epics.  While lacking much of the brutal power or authentic Aramaic language of Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion\\" other factors make this film just as fine a piece of art if not superior.  The Cinematography is stunning; the film is full of very symboolic imagery and the fine landscape of the American Southwest.  The acting is more than adequate, the cameos not hurting the film at all.  Sydow's performance made up for the fact he certainly isn't ethnically Hebrew.  Heston, Ferrer, and a multitude of famous or fairly well known actors make the film seem even more epic.  The musical score is well done.  Overall, an epic worthy of being called such.

0143036238|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.<br /><br />Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.<br /><br />This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics editionis also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike.

0192804782|5.0|I picked up this book largely due to fond memories of [[ASIN:0743487591 Pride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics)]], but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.<br /><br />The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.<br /><br />I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.<br /><br />In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading.
B000OMD4BG|5.0|Simply amazing. If you think you've heard the best of this beautiful man, you will think again once you've listened to this. All of his astonishing gifts, as always, coalesce and make for another transcendant musical and poetic experience. Of all of his recordings, this is to me without a doubt the absolute best. I am so grateful for the opportunity to experience and share Elliott smith's music. Genius and sensibility. Pain and beauty. Inspiration.
0141439580|5.0|Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.     I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.     Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.     In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel.
0525948023|5.0|This book is required reading for anyone on the journey of spiritual awakening and transcendence.  It's a new spiritual classic.  'A New Earth' lays out the folly of the ego.  It walks you through the many ways the ego makes life difficult and explains clearly how less ego leads to more enlightenment.  This book is very engaging and full of useful, practical advice and things to try to help you advance on the journey of self-realization.  If you are very self-aware already the first half of the book may not contain much that's new to you, but it's good to hear it all presented clearly and consistently.  The second half is full of advanced insights.  Tolle teaches that the self is not the ego (the voice in your head).  The self is the awareness behind the voice.  The awareness was there before the voice and will still be there after the voice is gone.  He teaches that as the voice names and identifies everything life loses its aliveness and luster.  He instructs us to stop thinking, however briefly, and experience the world anew and fresh.  Tolle helps us realize the true inner purpose of our being.  There are connections and parallels to many other excellent spiritual teachings. Tolle quotes the bible and seems to come from a religous background but don't let that scare you off.  He also refers to Buddhism, Zen, Taoism, Einstein, and even Shakespeare.  The Chapters: 1 - The Flowering of Human Consciousness 2 - Ego: The Current State of Humanity 3 - The Core of Ego 4 - Role-playing: The Many Faces of the Ego 5 - The Pain-Body 6 - Breaking Free 7 - Finding Who You Truly Are 8 - The Discovery of Inner Space 9 - Your Inner Purpose 10 - A New Earth  Chapters 1 through 5 lay out the functioning and malfunctioning of the ego.  Chapter 6 speaks about how to break free of the ego.  Chapter 7 through 9 speak to inner awareness and realization.  Chapter 10 describes a how to live as an awakened human being in the real world.  Personally, I had trouble connecting with his original book, 'The Power of Now'.  I found this book much more straight-forward and useful.
0425200450|5.0|Murder on the Orient Express is almost certainly the most famous Agatha Christie novel and may well be the best-known novel from the entire mystery genre. Despite the fact that I had been told the solution to the case many years ago, I decided to go ahead and finally read the book and am very glad that I did.     The basic plot, for any who don't already know, involves a murder on board a train with a small, but colorful, group of passengers. It becomes apparent relatively quickly that no one could have possibly committed the murder but Poirot has no option except to exercise his little gray cells to their utmost in an effort to solve the case. The story moves along at a nice clip and the cast is varied and interesting. My favorite aspect of any Poirot novel tends to be the little Belgian himself and he is in fine form here.     It is a tribute to Agatha Christie's writing that I could enjoy reading a mystery novel so much on my first read even knowing the murderer before starting. The book is an excellent choice whether you are an old Poirot fan who hasn't gotten around to it yet or a first-time Christie reader.
B0000630BT|5.0|I remember hearing this in a record store when it came out. At the time, I hadn't listened to much metal in general, focusing more on lighter fare. The fellow at the counter put on the title track, and I can clearly recall being genuinely shocked. From the blistering drumming in the opening, to the buzz-saw riffing, to the howls of rage that compose most of Halford's contribution to the title track, it was all rather overwhelming. By the time the first lead break kicked in, my mind basically shut itself down in self-defense, and retreated.     Basically put, this is Priest as they were up to that point, but a lot more extreme. The title track is the best (and most intense) song on the record, but there are other standouts; Hell Patrol, A Touch of Evil, Night Crawler, and Metal Meltdown come readily to mind. Halford's vocals are the best they ever were, and sometimes border on insanity, especially on the title track. The drumming is pretty good too. Probably the biggest surprise on the record is the guitar-work on the leads; Tipton and Downing tear it up like there's no tomorrow, employing dive-bombs, sweeping, extended runs and tapping, basically pulling out all the stops. This was, of course, part of the culture of the newer forms of metal in those days, but I'm sure a lot of Priest fans had no clue that they were capable of the speed and viciousness of most of the solos on the record.     Painkiller is also legendary for the amazing vacuousness of its lyrics, a reputation that is, unfortunately, richly deserved. I will say one thing however; when you listen to the molten slab of rage that is the title-track and hear Halford shriek about a metal messiah coming to save mankind, it seems to oddly fit. Given the hysteria of the performance, what do you want him to sing about? How mysterious life is? How hard it can be if your girl leaves you? How taxes can get you down? Ultimately, it doesn't really matter. If you're listening to a speed-metal album solely for the lyrics, I think you've taken some wrong turns in your life somewhere. I won't discount that decent lyrics can enhance even the most fearsomely extreme release (see Death for example), but it shouldn't detract too heavily from the experience. This is heavy metal at its most over-the-top. Take it, or leave it.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This movie is THE BEST - and I am not some screwball that says that about just anything.  A profoundly moving epic in the tradition of Frank Capra's masterwork \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\".  The story is tight and believable; the acting - top notch.  Even if you aren't compelled to buy this movie you HAVE to see it at least once.  Citizen Kane is OVER-RATED; it is ALL ABOUT Shawshank - see it today!
B000P0J024|5.0|Excellent.  I love the Wilburys and everything Beatle related and I was not disapointed.  We all know the CDs but packaged with the DVD is excellent.
B000ICM5W6|5.0|The best image from the HD-DVD. Very clear end sharp images. The best for me.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is an awesomely spectacular portrait of our planet. The cinematography will leave you breathless.  You will view incredible landscapes and fascinating wildlife that will leave you mesmerized. And that's not an exaggeration!    The latest technology in filming was used to make this documentary. Special cameras mounted on airplanes or helicopters can film animals kilometers away in amazing detail and resolution, thus never interfering with their natural behavior. In fact, the wild life would not even know of the presence of the film crew. Cameras were also placed on gliders, balloons, special winches...in order to bring to us the spectacular imagery. The series were filmed in high definition, so if you have the right equipment at home, I highly recommend you purchase the HD version. You'll be blown away!    Some places on our planet are so remote that they are unchartered and untouched by humanity. There thrive animals and plants so diverse, astonishing, and beautiful that we get a first hand sense of the miracle of life. Many of the species and their behavior were never filmed before. Sadly, though, these places together with their wildlife are disappearing at an alarming rate due to the damage we are doing to our world. Many of the species encountered in this series might very well be seen for the last time. Snow leopards, living at the foothills of the Himalayas, are so rare now that only 40 are assumed to be living today. They are such beautiful cats, and very rarely seen. In fact, the crew of Planet Earth had to spend a few months searching for them in order to film them.     There are 5 DVDs in all, with each one containing three episodes. The theme song is beautiful, and appropriate to the grandiose imagery in this documentary.    You will travel to the North Pole and visit, among other species, the white polar bear. You will witness a polar bear emerging from hibernation with its two cubs. What a beautiful shot that was. Together with their mom, the cubsslide down, for the very first time, a steep snow slope and make their way to the sea in search of food. Not all cubs survive their journey to the sea. With food scarce, polar bears are displaying unusual behavior. Being excellent swimmers, they now have to venture far in deep sea in order to find food. With the icecaps melting, there is no resting place for the polar bears out in the open sea, and many end up drowning. As a result, polar bears are becoming extinct.    In Antarctica, you will visit the penguins, and spend a full season with them while they care for their eggs. Penguins have a peculiar habit.  The female penguins lay their eggs, and then hand them over to the male to keep them in a pouch close to their feet. The female Penguins then travel out to sea to gather food for their soon to be babies, while the male penguins keep the eggs warm throughout the season until the eggs hatch. To keep warm, the penguins change positions, with those in the outer layer of the group slowly making their way inwards to the warmer areas in the center of the group, only to slowly make their way out again to make room for other penguins. In this way, all get the chance to warm themselves up. This behavior is quite fascinating to watch. The Planet Earth crew actually lived the whole season with the penguins in order to film that footage.    Watching the penguin eggs hatch was worth every penny of this series. Soon thereafter the female penguins return, their stomachs full of fish for their newborn. At this time, the male penguins reluctantly hand over the newborn to their mothers. The male penguins carried the eggs and cared for them for a whole season, and it is not easy for them to give them up to their mothers. These scenes show the love animals have towards each other. Many argue that killing animals is justified since animals are not intelligent beings. But how about love? Can we indiscriminately kill animals that display love? In animals, is intelligence more important than love for vice versa?    Mountainous areas are fascinating, with fascinating and unique wildlife. Some animals are better mountain climbers than the best of us, climbing and living on steep slopes that only a few climbers, with special equipment, can reach. Yet such animals are also becoming extinct as their habitat is slowly being destroyed by us.    There is some amazing footage of great white sharks leaping out of the water at great speeds (breach) to catch seals. Seals are however very agile, and many escape. It is just amazing watching the great white shark trying to catch a seal. Those scenes are unique and will leave you truly mesmerized at the wonder of the planet's wildlife.    Forests are another wonder of our planet, with millions of life forms dwelling in them. With the destruction of these forests, the life they contain is also being destroyed. Many such life forms are still unknown to scientists, and will probably never be known. Many of these species carry cures to existing and yet unknown diseases. Trees also produce oxygen, lots of oxygen, without which, needless to say, we would reach the next life sooner than expected, and probably be very unwelcomed.     Caves also offer us a glimpse at some amazing creatures. It is likely that life on other planets exist, for on our planet, organisms survive in extreme areas such as in very hot temperatures underground near lavas or extremely cold environments like in ice caps or deep under the sea. Many of these places you will probably only see on your TV screen, for they are pretty harsh environments to visit. Being a couch traveler is sometimes necessary, and fun.    The episode on shallow seas was also spectacular, but that habitat too is being destroyed by overfishing and by tourists. When you visit your friend's house, do you throw garbage on the floor? Do you break his furniture, plates, and glasses? We should show the same courtesy and care while visiting the wild habitats of our fellow life forms. We are as much dependent on them as they are on us.    At the end of each episode is the Planet Earth Diary, showing how the episode was filmed. It is really an adventure to film these episodes, and the diaries are just as fascinating as the series. A lot of patience, I mean really lots of patience was needed to film some of the shots in the series. Staying three months outdoors just to film a certain species was not unusual. This patience also demonstrates how rare some of the species have become. Lucky are the ones who can actually see them.    The DVDs also contain three episodes on the future of our planet. There are some really interesting ideas on how to save the species on our planet form extinction. One such idea seems too science fiction: sending lions to the moon! Scientists are now collecting genetic material from different species in order to preserve them for a future time when it will be possible to clone them. However, by that time, their habitat would have been destroyed in order to sustain the ever increasing human population. Some scientists believe that it will be possible in the future to send the cloned animals to other planets to live in remote and unchartered wilderness like their ancestors! What a fascinating concept!    Some scientists though believe in a more realistic solution. One solution is to bring down the human population to a more sustainable half a billion to a billion people. Presently our population is 7 billion, and increasing. If the standard of living of the entire population of the planet were to be raised in order to equal that of the United States, three planets would be necessary in order to sustain us!     One solution to reducing our population is by limiting the number of children families can have and by the use of birth control and sex education. Interestingly, the largest families are in the poorest regions of the world!    Presently, 80% of the world population lives at under $2 a day. How can you ask these poor people to preserve their environment when they have barely enough to feed themselves? Will you destroy a forest in order to gather wood and clear land for animal domestication in order to feed your children, or will you preserve the forest and its wildlife but have your children starve to death?     If we do succeed in ending world poverty by 2050 as Muhammad Yunus, the 2006 Nobel Laureate, hopes to do (read Banker to the Poor), what will this mean to our environment? If we succeed in that target, we will have 80% of our population consuming at twice or more the present rate.     In Collapse, Jared Diamond believes societies collapse due to the destruction of their immediate environment. He cites several examples of societies in the past that collapsed due to the destruction of its environment. One such case is the Easter Island society. Its population destroyed all its forest in order to build huge monuments. As a result, the wild life that came with the forest also disappeared, leaving the population starving to death! The Mayan civilization was another example of a society collapsing due to damage to its environment.    Will such a fate befall our next generation? How can we make the poor richer but somehow ask them to consume less while we consume more? The series will leave you with many unanswered questions. Our planet is spectacularly beautiful, but can we save it, and thus save ourselves?     What makes these series unique is that many of the unchartered places and wildlife you will see will not exist for our next generation. Our generation will probably be the most vilified of all generations for having destroyed our beautiful and diverse planet!

B00004T9VY|5.0|By changing his name from Cat Stevens to Yusuf Islam and leaving the world of popular music for private religious devotion, Cat Stevens did more harm to his long-term reputation than any critic could have done.  The brute truth is that in the early seventies Cat Stevens was the greatest popular perform in all of music.  It isn't merely that he sold a lot of records; he produced a string of stunningly brilliant albums.  Has there ever been a greater popular album than TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN or TEASER AND THE FIRECAT?  Perhaps, but once we exclude those released by the Beatles I'd bet we could count them on the fingers of one hand with more than one finger left over.  Anyone doubting how much Stevens's embrace of Islam has hurt him need only ponder this:  he is not a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Probably two-thirds of the people in the Hall are less deserving than Cat Stevens.<br /><br />Frankly, his conversion to Islam bothers me as much as most.  He didn't even go the sane route.  Richard Thompson is also a Muslim, but a Sufi, a branch of Islam that almost anyone can find acceptable.  But Stevens not only became a Muslim, but also made some disturbing public statements when some idiotic Muslim sage declared a fatwa on Salman Rushdie.  In recent years Stevens/Islam seems to have moderated somewhat, but there is no question that there is one and only one reason he is not in the HOF while Cleveland continues to induct queues of less qualified individuals:  he became a devout Muslim.<br /><br />But lets put that aside for a second.  The fact is that TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN is almost impossibly perfect.  Every song on the album is a gem, most are classics, most continue to be played on various radio stations over thirty-five years since their release.  We have an ambivalent social reaction to the album.  On the one hand we won't put Cat Stevens into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame where he, if anyone, belongs, but we continue to luxuriate in the absolute brilliance of his music.<br /><br />TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN is an embarrassment of riches.  In the early seventies Cat Stevens reeled out a string of albums, all of which had some or several great songs.  But he released two that were extraordinary masterpieces.  TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN and TEASER AND THE FIRECAT string together one exquisite song after another.  People listening to them for the first time in the new century are just as astonished by their beauty as those who heard them when they first came out.  What is more, either children or adults reaction in much the same way; musicians as much as non-musicians.  These may be the most accessible truly great songs released by any artist not named The Beatles.<br /><br />Ever since I heard these two albums, they have been among my favorite ever.  I will admit that I was unable to listen to them for quite some time.  I found it painful when Cat embraced Islam, with its incredibly regressive attitudes toward women (my main complaint toward Islam, since the terrorism many associate with it today truly is not a part of historical or even most contemporary Islam).  I couldn't listen to his music without a sense of betrayal.  There were great values in many of the songs!  Yet he had embraced religious belief that devalued women!<br /><br />Eventually, however, I started listening to the albums again.  How perfect these two albums are!  It is almost ludicrous how many great songs are on each of them.  TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN goes from \\"Where Will the Children Play\\" to \\"Hard-Headed Woman\\" (one of the songs I learned to play guitar on) to \\"Wild World\\" to \\"Sad Lisa\\" to \\"Miles from Nowhere\\" to \\"The Longer Boats\\" to \\"Into White\\" to \\"On the Road to Find Out\\" to \\"Father and Son.\\"  This is ridiculous!  Albums aren't supposed -- or at least aren't expected -- to have so many extraordinary songs!  The only weak song on the album is the title track that closed the disc.  \\"Father and Son\\" is one of, if not the greatest, intergenerational songever written, contrasting the view of a young man with his father, contrasting a content, unemotional, unresponsive father to a passionate, restless, desperate son.<br /><br />There is only one thing that is harder to comprehend than how great this album is. That is, TEASER AND THE FIRECAT was, if anything, better.<br /><br />These are both albums anyone who loves music has to not only love but completely ingest.  Yeah, I don't like the fact that he became a Muslim either.  But we really are at a point where we need to get past that and confess that there hasn't been a greater popular album released by anyone since Stevens released TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN and TEASER AND THE FIRECAT.  And for Allah's sake, induct the man into the Hall of Fame!iew of a young man with his father, contrasting a content, unemotional, unresponsive father to a passionate, restless, desperate son.

Bob Dylan's track, \\"Congratulations\\" is my favorite.. and George Harrison's tracks are also excellent.. while most reviews I have seen rate the 1st cd as the best, the 2nd cd is also excellent.. and the price was excellent..  I paid $19.99 for the 2 cd's and the dvd disk.. which contains all the videos for the group and a how the cd's were made documentary.. Dylan, Harrison, Orbison, Petty, and Jeff Lynn are magic together!!
0061142026|5.0|We often talk of a book, movie, or short story being a \\"fairy tale,\\" but Neil Gaiman's STARDUST is literally a fairy tale.  Though the past century has seen a host of stories of the supernatural, the world of the fairies generally has been neglected.  And indeed, even here most of the characters are human, witches, stars, or other kinds of creatures.  The book is enough to convince me that our writers have neglected fairies to our own detriment.  Some refer to STARDUST as a graphic novel, which is incorrect.  This is an illustrated novel and the difference between the two is significant.  The text of a graphic novel cannot stand on its own.  If you took away either the visual or textual component of any graphic novel the work would fall to bits.  Neither component is in any sense optional.  But with STARDUST, you could easily read the text alone with little or not loss of all of the essentials of the story.  The text is fully self-contained.  The illustrations are, in this case, optional -- though delightful -- embellishments.  Had Neil Gaiman chosen to publish STARDUST with no illustrations the book would have been very nearly as good.  Thankfully Charles Vess's (not sure why they have violated standard contemporary punctuation practice and not added an \\"s\\" to show possession on the cover of the book -- virtually all standard guides such as the MLA Handbook and the Chicago Manual of Style would have had the cover read \\"Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess's Stardust).<br /><br />With reluctance I have decided to write a spoiler free review.  Often I will post a spoiler warning at the beginning and then proceed to write a review that touches upon occasional spoilers.  But I think STARDUST is best read with as clean a slate as possible.  Instead, let me write about it in far more general terms.  STARDUST is above all about a special part of the world, a world in which fairies are real, where witches truly exist, and where magic governs life.  It is a world in which a magical glass flower cannot be bought with money, but can be purchased with a kiss.  It is a land where many seek and hope to find a fallen star.  It is a world in which the very woods are alive.  It is not, however, always a very happy story.  There are many, many dark moments (though this was true as well in the Grimm brothers' stories) and you heart will often ache for some terrible misfortune.<br /><br />Ultimately what makes this such a delicious story is Gaiman's impeccably good taste and fertile imagination.  Many of the elements of the story can be anticipated, but the particular way that they are resolved cannot.  For instance, I was surprised by the final scene involving the main witch and by the end of the search by the three brothers for the medallion that will be found with the fallen star.  That is the challenge with a story like this.  There are some elements that almost any such story will be forced to include, the challenge being resolving those elements a a new and satisfying way.  In this Gaiman succeeds again and again.  By the end of the story the reader will have a wonderful sense of having explored marvelous and magical places through a wonderfully and perfectly related tale.  Not everything in the story is explained.  A healthy number of bits of the story are left wrapped in mystery, such as the precise identity of the protagonists traveling companion and benefactor when he first enters the land beyond the wall.  And we learn very much about the man in the top hat who makes appearance both early in the tale and late.  But I found absolutely nothing to criticize at the ending of the story.  It truly is a perfectly told story.<br /><br />Although this is a review of the book and not the film, I have to state a bit of regret that Sarah Michelle Gellar was not able, due to scheduling conflicts, to take the role of Yvaine.  I can't imagine anyone who would have been more perfect for the role and while I like Claire Danes, she doesn't have quite SMG's ethereal beauty.  SMG says that her husband was scheduled to film something in New York and she chose to be with him rather than make the movie.  But with her career languishing following the ending of BUFFY, she really needed/needs a role to break her out of her doldrums.  This would have been that role.  Mr. Prinze's role better have been a great one to deprive his wife of such a plummy role as this one.<br /><br />Warning!  My review is of the illustrated version of the story.  There is to accompany the newly released movie a simply godawful mass-market paperback edition with the actors from the film on the cover.  Boycott that edition!  The sooner it goes out of existence the better.  I think movie tie-in editions are an abomination of publishing.G says that her husband was scheduled to film something in New York and she chose to be with him rather than make the movie.

B000I5X80G|5.0|As the very long awaited Neil Young anthology finally nears release, this may just be a taste of what's to come, but it's a sweet taste anyway.  One of Young's trademarks - especially with Crazy Horse - has always been an instrumental style that is objectively ragged and not technically proficient, but which more than makes up the deficit in emotion.  Not surprisingly, the Crazy Horse sound is often said to be much better captured live than in the studio.      Never has that been truer than here.  \\"Down By the River\\" never drags through the extended jams where the not-bad original sometimes did.  The far more concise \\"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere\\" and \\"Winterlong\\" are at their most electrifying here as well.  \\"Wonderin',\\" up to now a curio from the best-forgotten Everybody's Rockin' album that was probably only known to hardcore fans, turns up here as a pleasantly loose country rocker.  But of course the real revelation is \\"Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown,\\" written and sung by the late Danny Whitten (who was soon to become the inspiration for \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" and \\"Tonight's the Night\\").  However tragic his story proved to be, Whitten knew how to rock and roll, and this performance shows why he was a favorite sideman of Young's.      As for complaints that this set is shorter than it should be, I see no cause for criticism when the performances that are included here are top-notch.  The sound quality is also superb for a live recording of this vintage (something you can't always count on with Young).  One way in which I do think it falls short is the DVD, which is just a collection of still photos of the band in action superimposed on a reel-to-reel tape deck playing the exact same recording found on the CD.  But I, for one, just bought it for the music anyhow.  As far as that goes, it delivers.

0743219619|2.0|Unlike some authors (Jonathan Kellerman, Maeve Binchy, Steve Martini) who write some terrific books and then go downhill, PD James's books get better and better with time. It's her early works I can't stand. It's not just me, either. Some of her early novels were entirely rewritten for television to get people to watch. I once contacted PBS to see if I had missed some of her books that seemed so good on Mystery! They actually told me this. This book was about in the middle of her long career, but it just never captured my interest. Look at her settings--hospitals, nursing homes, monastaries, hardly the locales for a hotbed of action to keep you on the edge of your seat. This book is set at a home for the disabled with progressive diseases out in the middle of nowhere. Dalgliesh is working alone, in fact recovering from mono and pneumonia and goes there to visit an elderly priest who turns up dead of a heart attack. There isn't much to suggest crimes have in fact been committed and Dalgliesh's sudden deduction of what is going on at the end is not even remotely believable. The only interesting thing anyone does in this book is drop dead occasionally. It's not a police procedural. When I compare it to something like Death in Holy Orders, there's no reason to read this book. It isn't awful (and some of James's other books are really awful) but she has much better ones in her repertoire.

B00005QZ7U|1.0|Here is an example of a film that looks great but is a terrible mess.  If you feel that elton john madonna et al need more residuals ($$) for their music, then perhaps you will like this film, but my husband and I watched half of it in great discomfort waiting for some kind of shift in its lack.  We noticed so many problems with editing, script, song choices,  and voice overs for all the songs we ceased to care about the beautiful sets, actors and costumes.  We wanted it to be fun and waited for it to be fun, but  ultimately felt that our tastes, senses and intelligence had been insulted.  I can see that many many liked this spectacle, so I just wanted to add that I feel it may be the worst big budget film I have ever seen.  I wish I could give it zero stars.  This is not a successful musical in any way.

1594489505|1.0|You can fool some people most of the time unless you are the writer of \\"A thousand spledid suns\\", in which case you can apparently fool everybody all the time.  Shallow, unimaginative, predictable, didactic - these are some of the adjectives that do justice to Husseini's second novel. The writer is milking the history of his bleeding homeland, putting unashamedly everything in a carefully designed package, widely hailed already as \\"a true classic\\". It is as true and as classic as any well-conceived, calculately planned soap opera. The lack of greatness and unquestionable talent - read for comparison Orchan Pamuk's \\"Snow\\" - is mistakenly gloryfied as authentcitiy and simplicity. The only authentic achievement is Husseini's admirable capacity to come up with a thousand spledid tricks to market his fashionable new product.

The stars include Jean Reno, Jon Voight, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ving Rhames, and Vanessa Redgrave.  This former summer blockbuster, the successful film that inspired to sequels, is well-worth revisiting.  It is an enjoyable and complex romp that is very memorable.

B000ETRCMQ|4.0|In trying to think of a phrase to describe this film, the first that comes to mind is \\"coming-of-age.\\" This might seem like an odd descriptor, given that the protagonist is a full-grown adult - one who is, in fact, likely approaching middle age - and yet this film invites the audience to view not just the physical, but the emotional transformation of Bree.<br /><br />To quickly some up the early plot points without giving anything away, Bree is a male to female transsexual who is a mere two weeks away from her final gender reassignment surgery. Suddenly one night, she receives a call from a boy, placed in a juvenile detention facility, looking for his father, Stanley, which just happens to have been Bree's name when she was living as a man. Bree's therapist encourages her to go see and learn about this son, as she must reconcile her future life as a woman with her past life as a man before she can be fully ready to transition.<br /><br />What follows is a moving, and funny, tale as Bree bonds with her son and eventually learns to take responsibility for her past life and past actions. As we see Bree become more comfortable with herself as a woman, we also see her grow more confident, responsible, and loving. She grows to realize that, although her life as a woman is the life she wants to lead, it is not the secret to happiness, and that there are other things in life that are important.<br /><br />Felicity Huffman deserves all the accolades she got for her part in this film, and Kevin Zegers as her son showed the perfect combination of childishness, rebelliousness, self-sufficiency, and vulnerability. The film is both emotional and funny, though the characters are never the butt of the jokes.<br /><br />Were it not for a couple sequences that dragged on too long about two-thirds of the way through the film, I would have given it five stars. Nonetheless, it is well worth seeing.

0385522401|3.0|Three stars may be a bit unfair but just this week the Booker Prize 2007 longlist was announced and Chesil Beach is the odds on favorite to win it. I find this somewhat annoying. No doubt Chesil is an impeccably written story, but I somehow feel that impeccable writing is the least we'd expect from such a renowned novelist, especially writing in short story format (yes book is 200 pages long, but with normal pages this would drop at least a third).      While the overall theme is engrossing and the characterizations wonderful, Florence's wedding night behavior seem somewhat farfetched and forced in an otherwise very realistic setting. I also found the ending of the novel disappointing: after so much care and attention to creating a tension-filled few hours, some 40 years in a life pass by in a handful of pages.    All in all, if one is looking to savor McEwan I would suggest \\"Atonement\\". \\"On Chesil Beach\\" left me feeling a bit shortchanged for having been sold a novel for what is really an extended short story.
1400062756|5.0|Carol Dweck's book is an essential read for any parent, educator, leader or student. In other words it is essential read for just about anybody. Dweck, in her very well-written book, exposes our often hidden assumptions about abilities and intelligence. She provides many excellent examples from education, sports and business.    Some reviewers at this site have been critical that Dweck does not provide specific instructions as to how to move from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. I believe they miss the point. By becoming aware of what we were formally unaware of, we will automatically begin the process of change. Since this process of change is different for each of us, there can be no specific instructions.     What we are unaware of binds us. Dweck helps to remove our chains.

0143038419|5.0|I listened to this book on CD and absolutely *loved* it! It's my opinion that Liz Gilbert was absolutely NOT \\"selfish\\" in leaving her marriage, as one reader put it. Instead I found her to be unbelievably courageous in what she did...being true to herself, rather than continuing on in a relationship/marriage that looked good on the outside but was no longer working for her. What else should she have done...\\"pretended\\" to be happy and at peace, when in actuality she was totally miserable? I've been there/done that...and it didn't (doesn't) work!    Liz's tales and travails of her year long adventure were alternately sweet, funny, sad, touching...and always incredibly real and honest.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I've told several friends about this book, and they've practically flipped over backward in appreciation that I did.    FABULOUS FABULOUS FABULOUS BOOK! READ IT...YOU'LL BE SOOOOOOO GLAD YOU DID!
0790731894|5.0|I have seen this movie many times on tv and never tire of it. So recently I decided to add the dvd to my collection. I was VERY disappointed in the picture quality.

B000K7VHQE|4.0|Here's the movie the Motion Picture Academy overrated and nominated for best picture for 2006, much as it did with \\"Sideways\\" a 2004 flick about a pair of middle aged guys travleing through California's wine country a few years earlier. This one is about a dysfunctional family traveling in California too. Think there's a coincidental relationship between the academy nominating each for best picture? Maybe it has something to do with all the electors and voters living in California?<br /><br />As you probably know, this involves a typically dysfunctional family (highly Hollywoodized) that consists of an out of work dad (Greg Kinnear), standup mom that holds it all together (Toni Collette), pervert father that lives with them (Alan Arkin), loser brother that lost his boyfriend and job, tried to commit suicide, and now lives with them (Steve Carell, better known as the \\"40 Year Old Virgin\\"), bitter and alienated teenage son (Paul Dano) and the star, Little Miss Sunshine herself, 12-year-old Olive (Abagail Breslin) who wins a local contest and competes for the national title of the named character.<br /><br />The action revolves around the family taking its trip from New Mexico to the pagaent near Los Angeles and the various underlying stories that go on while that's in progress. Every character is a cliche, of course, with the mother being the typical savior that holds it all together. The film is variably hilarious, stupid, insightful, energetic, arousing, perverted and sentimental. You will laugh a lot at and with these characters during their trip to, and arrival at, the Little Miss Sunshine pagaent, where a lot of nonsense breaks out that would only occur in a movie or a Three Stooges routine.<br /><br />If you're like me, you'll wonder why the Motion Picture Academy thought this was one of the five best movies of 2006. Its temperament reminds me a bit of \\"In America\\", a movie from 2002 starring a pair of real life sisters that lit up the screen with transcendent performances that bordered on magic. That film didn't have the outright humor of \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" but it was, from my perspective, a far better production and a much better story.<br /><br />This one will leave you feeling good, if that's your goal, and it will entertain you throughout, but it definitely should not have been considered an Oscar contender.d on magic.

0618680004|2.0|This is the first book that I read by this author and I am disappointed - I expected more. In fact, it was a slow and tedious read and I do not recommend it.    The main purpose of this book is to provide anti-religious ammunition and reasons to those who already are atheists or intelligent agnostics. To that end, the author provides good points.    Unfortunately, the book is too combative and sounds angry overall, offending religious beliefs rather often. With this tone, it is unlikely to persuade moderate Christians or Muslims to abandon their faith.    Perhaps the best points of this book are that it shows the damage of fundamentalist religion to society and explains cosmology and evolution theories that provide a scientifically accepted alternative to creationism. However, a much more concise book could have achieved these goals without sounding as negative.

0812548094|2.0|Pros:<br />--Richard<br />--Seamless fantasy world building<br />--Individual scenes of excellent prose<br /><br />As a lover of fantasy, I appreciate Terry Goodkind's world building skills. He does a phenomenal job creating a world where magic is part of Nature's balance both in the world of the living (The Creator) and the dead (The Keeper). His prose, in varying stretches of the novel, leads me to forgetting that I'm reading as I become immersed in individual scenes.<br /><br />So why 2 stars?<br />Con:<br />--Overwritten scenes that become tired melodrama<br />--Characters with conflicting behaviors and actions<br />--Overkill of author's drama for anti-woman sentiment<br />--Simplistic and overdose of rape (This book is NC17)<br /><br />The characters are far too inconsistent in their behaviors and actions, and storytelling is overdone. Let me say first that Richard is consistent in his personality and actions. He's the only one. The rest of the main characters, especially Kahlan succumb to the Wizard's First Rule, that people will believe in something out of fear or ignorance. One might argue that even the wise fall prey. That's potential good drama. Bad drama is when the characters you've been led to believe are wise, assertive, and make good decisions under great stress, \\"repeatedly\\" act like they have no sense in the world. Because I respect Kahlan's character and the others like Zed, I found the unusual behaviors contrived by the author just to magnify some \\"dramatic\\" moment. The result consistently fell flat and largely unimaginative.<br /><br />It's Goodkind's prerogative to create a world where misogyny breeds under the surface ready to explode. In Stone of Tears, readers are beaten over the head with it. Several rape scenes (implied to uncomfortably graphic) are used at pivotal moments in the story where a modestly skillful writer could have created horror and sympathy in less \\"in your face\\" detail. From villains spouting their views to getting into a woman's head while she is being raped did not help those story moments move forward, NOR did they serve any moral point of reflection that might have remotely support the content.<br /><br />When the story focused on Richard and his struggles, there was drama, character complexity, and, yes, moments of \\"ahas\\" for the reader as Richard grows into accepting himself (minus the melodramatic hint of a Romeo and Juliet suicide). The rest can be skipped over unless one has a voyeur desire for bad soap opera. If you read only Richard's story, you will have a great journey.

B000FDEUFS|3.0|After reading all the reviews, I decided to buy this package. It is in a lot of ways a disappointment. Comparing the second disc to The Fillmore Concerts, it doesn't even come close in terms of sound quality or performances. This show the band sounds tired and lacking the intensity of the FC discs. For instance, track 5 on disc 2 (I.M.O.E.R.), is played  slower than usual and Whipping Post is performed light years differently than on The F.C. disc. At times it sounds as though Duane and Dicky are not in tune with each other. I fail to understand why Universal music decided to include two tracks on disc 2 from 3-71 and move One Way Out, from the last show to disc 1. And Mountain Jam on disc 1, is this the only decent version of this track? Were any other versions recorded during this same period?. I would like to hear all the Fillmore shows in the proper running order, remixed of course like the stellar Fillmore Concerts set. My advice would be to stick to the Fillmore Concerts set if want the very best sound and performances. I have heard raves about how good the sound quality is on this Eat A Peach deluxe edition, sorry I don't agree. This was the 70's and recording technology was not as good as it is today. Now if it were given the red-carpet treatment, it may have sounded much better. The high end is rolled off, there's way too much bass in the mix, and at times solos are distant. A complete remix should have been done to start with. But in the end what really matters are the performances and they are not that great (the 6-27-71 show). Disc 1/9 tracks/69.37. Disc 2/9 tracks/76.27. The booklet and packaging are fine.
0143038419|2.0|While Ms. Gilbert has a wonderful sense of humor, it is buried beneath self pity and complaining. Her story is a search for God which I believe may of us go through in our life. Unfortunately Gilbert's journey is rife with indulgent self analysis that few people can relate to.     I know too many people that have faced and conquered truly life shattering events and not only survived but extablished a relationship with God that is remarkable.     I read this book with my book club and I am eager to see if anyone has the same reaction as mine.

Most of the actors and actresses hired were new to acting, which reduced the quality of the movie. Second, the plot line was decent, but it could've been a little more elaborated. However, the movie redeems itself with the special effects.    To sum it up, though some of the movies aspects were weak, I will be buying the DVD.
0743270754|5.0|This book was not what I expected at all.  It easily surpassed what I thought would be a detailed account of life in the White House during the Civil War.  It had that, but it also built up the characters of Bates, Chase, Seward, Lincoln and others from the decades previous.  It was very interesting how the cabinet came together during the war years, but it was just as interesting how they differed.  I came away with much more respect for all of these men (especially Lincoln) and even their families.  I would read anything from Goodwin at this point.
0517223546|1.0|As a fan of authors like Michener, and well-written historical fiction, I found this book teeeeedious and boooooring.  I have a real problem with books that read, \\"And then an event happened that changed their lives forever....\\" instead of just telling the story and surprising the reader with said event.  The first few times it happened I was forgiving and kept on....but by the 16th or 17th time I was insulted and threw the book across the room.  That's just bad storytelling in my book. :) This is one of the only books I have started and not finished....and I was a few hundred pages in.  I have heard that the books by Alison Weir concerning British history (albeit later in the game) are beautifully written and historically accurate....we shall see!  If you enjoy this book, more power to you.  I just could not take it.

B00005JPQL|5.0|I don't even know where to begin. I thought the movie was fantastic. I love the book, and am usually sorely disappointed by film adaptions. I had a feeling this one might be different so I was very excited to go see it.<br /><br />For the book lovers, it does have some changes. Most of the time changes make me crazy, but oddly enough it didn't bother me too much. They kept the majority of the story intact.<br /><br />The score was awesome, the scenery was unbelievable. The movie was funny, endearing and thrilling. I thought all the acting was good, and though they changed Robert DeNiro's character and embellished it for the film, he was hysterical. Claire Danes is very believable as a fallen star, and though Charlie Cox is fairly new and not yet a recognizable actor, I think he brought an innocence and freshness to the lead role of Tristan. Michelle Pfeiffer is such a fun witch! Enchanting when she's 'young' and scary as she begins to age again.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie(and book!) to just about anyone.
B000C65Z1G|3.0|The real virtues of this film are offset by the dripping smugness. Yes, I too am invigorated by a film in an exotic setting, but there is something terribly predictable about bright, rich women holding little brown babies and screaming at their boyfriends, husbands, or bosses because they dare not to care. Particularly, I find, this plot, set in motion by the angry female protagonists, dominates British drama. One thinks, off-hand, of David Hare's \\"Plenty\\" - about the maddened former resistance fighter who can't accept peacetime life (Meryl Streep). Here we have the ineffectual husband (Fiennes) battling his self-righteous wife, who's decided to take on the pharmaceutical industry. Curiously, these gals come to these scandals of capitalism with wide-eyed innocence, having learned nothing whatsoever about the world at their posh private schools and expensive universities. While American 13-year-olds start ranting at their parents for signs of blatant hypocrisy, these 30-something Brits remain under the impression that the country houses they enjoy visiting over weekend were paid for with profits from the tooth fairy. This affair bored me to death, but is set in just the sort of setting one might say provides viewers the benefits of a cheap trip.
B000002IHD|5.0|I lost  my old tapes of Otis Redding  so I was thrilled when I found this CD. I have another CD that is similar and I just can't find anything bad to say about either one.  I was lucky  to  see him up close at Basin Street West in the 60's (San Francisco) not  long before the tragic plane accident.  It was the best performance I have ever seen  BAR NONE ! This Cd is not as good as that experience but if I close my eyes and no one else is around it brings me back to that night, almost .
B00005NGAL|2.0|Well, I finally got to see Cats. I bought the DVD at a shop and saw it. Well, the production and the customes may look great to others. I found the show boring. So if you are looking for a unified theme and a purpose of theme, it is not really there. If you are looking for great, long lasting musical pieces, you would not find many, except for Memory. If you just want to see the show becasue it has so much fame, by all means. If you have high expectations, you may as well get disappointed.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|If you've seen one of these movies its likely you've seen them all. And their utter badness is what makes them such classics to own. This is by far the best way to buy them, too. Four movies in one box, you cant get this kind of deal with any other series of films, that's for sure. And the best part about these films, like with the recent film Slither, is thee humor that goes right along. These are not staged horror films, but what could be real people's real reactions to seeing giant monsters. The first is my favorite, and in some people opinion the second might be better... and the third, well the name of the monsters in that movie is priceless, and the fourth, well most historical movies tend to bore me, but its worth seeing how to combat monsters in the old west.  If you love sci-fi thats so bad its good than get these!

1594489505|5.0|This is the second book by Mr. Hosseini.  Like his first novel, The Kite Runner, this book is packed with characters that come to life in the mind's eye and explain the unfortunate situation in a beleaguered Afghanistan.   The author has interlaced some  historical reality into the novel, giving one an appreciation of the time frame and events that occur.  The novel is a page turner, leaving the reader anxious to get from one chapter to the next.  The author departs from a male narrative in this novel, and writes from a female perspective about  the lives of the characters. This is a very brave thing for a male author to do, and to achieve it so well. Rather than describe the novel further, I would just say read it.  I recommended The Kite Runner to all of my friends and they were very pleased. A Thousand Splendid Suns is worth your time, energy and empathy.
B000002OX7|5.0|First, the down side - the extra tracks add and take away.  The original album had a certain kind of compact balance that does not exist in this expanded version.<br /><br />Now, the upside - the original album is outstanding top to bottom, front to back.  Variety, symmetry, dynamism and impact.  No need for a track by track analysis - the original album was and is a living, breathing monument to beauty and creativity.  Long live the Who!!!
B00005JPFF|4.0|Let me start with saying that I am a huge fan of Spiderman 2. I went to watch Spiderman 3 with an open mind, having read some reviews that this one wasn't as good. I have to agree with those reviews. While this movie is still entertaining, it is quite flawed. Especially the plot is weak at several points. But I still enjoyed this movie. It does have almost all the ingredients of a typical Spidey flick - good vs bad, right vs wrong, strong emotions, intensity (although not as intense as Spidey 2), love, dutifulness, revenge, vulnerability.... Having said that, it could have done away with some silly stuff. It was funny to see Spiderman going emo and doing some silly acts. LOL.    The direction, while not award worthy, isn't bad either. Sam Raimi is good at creating drama, and he did that well here too. The same goes for acting. The action scenes are great (as one would expect). Overall, quite an entertaining movie.. there wasn't a moment when I was bored. I would give it three and half stars.    The wait begins for Spiderman 4..
B000F9RB8A|4.0|This disk has very good (above average) video transfer, but what really shines is its Chinese uncompressed PCM audio track.  After watching the movie, I long for Chinese traditional music on blu-ray.  Listen to the full sound track of \\"Ambush From All/Ten Sides\\" in uncompressed PCM will be heavenly.    Movie-wise, I like the art directions and the special effects.  But some of the actors appear to be rather wooden (the barber and Chow's pal, for example).  I also found this movie isn't as funny as I hoped it to be.
B00005JPQL|5.0|SPOILERS, SPOILERS (and more SPOILERS)!<br /><br />Crossover success is seldom when it comes to comic book writers aspiring to become novelists. Peter David comes to mind. And then there's Neil Gaiman. Gaiman's [[ASIN:0060557818 Neverwhere: A Novel]], [[ASIN:0380789035 American Gods]], [[ASIN:0061139378 Coraline]], and [[ASIN:0061142026 Stardust]] are novels, of which mysterious and wondrous imaginative contents rival the works of Tim Powers. He'd even teamed up with Terry Pratchett to co-author [[ASIN:0060853980 Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch]]. And it still tickles me that Gaiman won the prestigious World Fantasy Award back in 1991 for a comic book issue (Sandman #19, \\"A Midsummer's Night Dream\\"), after which comic books were subsequently disallowed from competing. All of which is a long-winded way of saying that when a film adaptation of a Gaiman work is attempted, it has some ways to go to meet the expectations of his readers. Which brings us finally to STARDUST, one such successful adaptation.<br /><br />This is what's going on: 150 years ago, just a bit past the picturesque English village simply called Wall (named for the innocuous-looking stone wall bordering this same village), a young man once crossed over into an enchanted realm and had a tryst with an enslaved girl. Nine months later, a baby named Tristan is delivered onto his doorstep. Eighteen years elapse, and shopboy Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox) has fallen for Victoria, the conceited village beauty. During an evening outing, Tristan and Victoria espy a falling star. Fearing that a rival might very soon propose to her, Tristan vows, perhaps foolhardily, to fetch the falling star for Victoria as a token of his affections.<br /><br />To do so, he must traverse the wall beyond the village, which is rumored to be the portal to a magical world. But, first, Tristan has to get by the 97-year-old Guard of the Wall, who's more spry than he really should be. But Tristan circumvents the Guard and finds himself promptly catapulted into a strange and wondrous adventure. The falling star, it seems, is not merely a falling star. In the magical kingdom of Stormhold, this heavenly body metamorphoses into a comely but very cranky woman whose name is Yvaine (Claire Danes). Tristan makes a pact with Yvaine. In exchange of returning with Tristan to Wall and presenting her to his beloved, Tristan will help Yvaine ascend to her celestial home. At this stage of the story, Tristan has actually gained the means to make this so.<br /><br />But it's too early for happily ever after, and, as mentioned in the film, \\"No star is safe that is too low.\\" Odd and frightening creatures are after the falling star, vying for the owning of it (or her). On Yvaine and Tristan's heels follows an evil and incredibly vain witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer, in a wonderful turn), who craves eternal youth. Too, the sinister remaining son of a recently deceased monarch seeks the ruby necklace worn by Yvaine, of which ownership would grant him the kingdom of Stormhold. This prince, Septimus, is unawares that he is accompanied by his six murdered brothers (most of whom he seems to have murdered himself). There are also buccaneers who sail the open skies and who bottle and sell lightning (although I don't remember them in the book). And there's also a goat. For a prospective hero as fumbling and naive as Tristan seems to be, it just might take someone in the mold of a Robert DeNiro to show him the ropes.<br /><br />Director Matthew Vaughn, mostly known for crafting gritty crime thrillers, channels his inner Hans Christian Anderson for this one. Or, rather more accurately, his inner William Goldman. Because, STARDUST reminds me most of [[ASIN:B00005LOKQ The Princess Bride (Special Edition)]] in its whimsy, charm, and rousing sense of adventure, while also recalling to mind [[ASIN:0767809335 The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]] and other slightly off the wall Terry Gilliam efforts.<br /><br />STARDUST the film is, of course, based on Neil Gaiman's terrific book, which in turn was based on his graphic novel (with the remarkable Charles Vess doing the illustrating honors). Discerning fantasy lovers won't find much to pick at. This film captures the storytelling essence of the classic fairy tales while infusing enough wit and tongue in cheek humor to make the viewing experience accessible to one and all. Particularly fun was the snarky and spectral presence of the slain brothers, whose expressions, snide commentaries, and reactions provide good chuckles. But, no worries, the humor doesn't get in the way of the storytelling.<br /><br />British actors rock. Young Charlie Cox is quite disarming as the initially wimpy, but suddenly dashing hero and somehow reminds me of Orlando Bloom. Mark Strong as Septimus makes for a good villain, grim, undetered, and scowling a lot. On the other hand, there's a decidedly wicked gleam lit in the ancient eyes of Peter O'Toole as he demonstrates, in his all too brief scene, a good example of gallows humor. Sienna Miller and a droll Ricky Gervais also have minor roles. But the Yanks give as good as they get, even if they're pretending to be Brits. Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer's English accents may slip now and then, but, otherwise, are very fine. Particularly Pfeiffer, who has a nice turn as the witchy crone Lamia, who probably wishes Botox had been invented much sooner. There's a go-to comedic vein which she consistently mines as her character's continuing use of magic resorts to a progressive eroding of her stolen youth and beauty. Then, there's Bob DeNiro, who doesn't even pretend a Brit accent. I don't want to say anymore about him, other than, in this flick, he cheerfully upends his tough guy reputation.<br /><br />To segue a bit: if you're gonna check out this film, prep yourself for a flood of Harry Potter wannabes. The trailers before the film screening offered up THE SEEKER: THE DARK IS RISING (which looks to be an uber-crap adaptation of Susan Cooper's very good fantasy work), THE GOLDEN COMPASS (looks promising), and THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES (also promising). I could practically smell the greed exuding from the Hollywood financial high rollers. STARDUST, naturally, is also out to make bank. But, thank goodness and best of all, the film itself is one of which content lacks in cynicism and overt, intrusive modern references. Even DeNiro's piratical transgressions are handled rather sweetly. In fact, STARDUST, for all its mild grisliness, is a sweet-natured film, espousing all the things we, as tykes, loved in a magical story. Nowadays, with all the disillusion going on, it's a damn treat to have a fairy tale actually end with the traditional \\"And they lived happily ever after.\\"<br /><br />But, what happened to the unicorn?orts.<br /><br />STARDUST the film is, of course, based on Neil Gaiman's terrific book, which in turn was based on his graphic novel (with the remarkable Charles Vess doing the illustrating honors).

B000HIVQD0|5.0|Those prophetic words come from the breakthrough single \\"Brass In Pocket,\\" and they completely sum up the debut album from The Pretenders. This band of English scruffs backed up ex-pat Chrissie Hynde and made one of rock's all time great debut albums. At a time when female singers either had to be disco wailers or blues chicks (the sole exception being Heart), Chrissie completely smashed all the old stereotypes and marked a new era in female singers. She, along with vocalists like Pat Benatar and Patti Smith, made it cool for independent women to make music that was sexy because it wasn't sexual. Remember Pat Benatar's classic quote of \\"you break my heart and I'll kick your a**\\"? Chrissie was that to the n'th degree.<br /><br />\\"The Pretenders\\" mixed hard rock and pop sense so flawlessly that the band never again came close to matching it. From the sweet longing of \\"Brass In Pocket\\" to the cool dismissiveness of \\"Up The Neck\\" (\\"it was all very...run of the mill\\"), Chrissie delivered tough and tender in equal doses with full credibility. Having James Honeyman Scott throwing inventive riffs behind almost every song certainly helped, as did the undeniable power of Martin Chambers and Pete Farndon -- listen to his bass work on \\"The Wait\\" -- as a rhythm team. (And dammit, why did James and Pete have to OD themselves? When will we ever learn?)<br /><br />One of the juicy things about this double disc release is the bonus CD. You get a pair of songs that weren't on CD before (save for [[ASIN:B000E1ZBHC Pirate Radio]]), \\"Porcelain\\" and \\"Cuban Slide.\\" The demos are interesting in just how little they changed before they came on the original album. I chuckled at the \\"Roxanne\\" quote before the demo of \\"Kid\\" and was surprised that \\"Brass In Pocket\\" started out as a down-tempo number. The live tracks show The Pretenders to be incendiary in concert. The packaging itself is a blast, including lyrics! (I guess I was singing the wrong words all these years....)<br /><br />All the chemistry was in perfect coordination here. Even the one moment when Nick Lowe steps in for producer, a cover of The Kinks' \\"Stop Your Sobbing,\\" can't break the synergy of this album. It remains a timeless debut, standing tall alongside of first efforts of the period from Tom Petty, Elvis Costello, Joe Jackson and The Cars.coordination here.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Before the 2006 film \\"Casino Royale\\" film was released in theaters, it caused a controversy among loyal James Bond fans because the actor chosen to play long-time spy James Bond, 007, was Daniel Craig, who is blond.  No other previous James Bond had been blond, but once people began to see the film, the trivial blond hair controversy quickly faded as the action-packed & far more realistic film caught everyone off guard.  Though there were several female characters in the film, there were no so-called \\"Bond-girls\\" to be found in this thriller.  Even gone were the silhouettes of naked women within the trademark opening credits of the film.  Thus, what director Martin Campbell (who directed the 1995 James Bond film \\"GoldenEye\\") and executive producers Callum McDougall (who produced the 2004 \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" and the 2002 \\"Die Another Day\\") and Anthony Waye (who also produced \\"Die Another Day\\" and \\"GoldenEye\\") wanted to portray in \\"Casino Royale\\" was a raw and very human James Bond, who was also athletically fit and strong-minded.    Based upon Ian Fleming's (1908-1964) first-ever James Bond book entitled \\"Casino Royale\\", published in 1953, Bond battles an underworld figure known as Le Chiffre (which literally means \\"the cypher\\" and was played by Mads Mikkelsen) who is a financier to various terrorist organizations.  To bolster is dwindling finances, Le Chiffre organizes a high-stakes poker game (originally a baccarat game) in the famous European \\"Casino Royale\\".  However, things don't go as planned due to Bond's participation, with the assistance of British government representative Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).    With stellar acting from Daniel Craig, Mads Mikkelsen and Judi Dench (who reprised her role as \\"M\\"), a brilliant story and lots of action, \\"Casino Royale\\" earns a well-deserved 5 out of 5 stars and quite possibly is the best James Bond film ever produced.  I look forward to any future James Bond films starring Daniel Craig as James Bond.As a side note, the 1967 comedic version of \\"[[ASIN:B00005JL0I Casino Royale]]\\" (that starred David Niven, Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, Orson Wells and Woody Allen) was also based upon the original 1953 \\"Casino Royale\\" novel.  It includes the character Le Chiffre (Orson Wells) and retains the original game of baccarat and the organization known as SMERSH, but that organization (lead by Woody Allen's character, the James Bond's nephew) was quite different from the book and not included in the 2006 serious film version.
1400063515|3.0|The fundamental premise of the book is that it is the unknown or highly improbable events that have the biigest impact.  There are myriad examples of how business, society and individuals closely monitor the known risks yet do not position to limit the downside of negative black swans or expose themselves to positive black swans.    The concepts in the book are good. For example the fallacy of trying to apply rational predictive tools, like normal distribution curves, to social science being one of the best ones.  It is interesting with the current subprime mortgage issues causing roller coaster fluctuations on the market over the last couple of weeks: it reinforces that market experts have little idea about what is really going on.      I also like the concept that history is always written with 20/20 hindsight.  NNT looks at diaries at the time immediately prior to WW1 which don't predict the turmoil, but to historians after the event it was all as plain as day as to what was happening.      The big problem i have with the book is that it is written in such a pompous and arrogant style.  NNT isn't really trying to engage the reader, it seems he is trying to show the world what a superior individual he is to the rest of us.  According to him he is a great mathematician, philosopher, writer, trader, statistician amongst the many other talents which he probably didn't have time to mention.  This book could have been really good but unfortunately the author forgets that his readers are more important than him and while he leaves you slightly intrigued I found myself more frustrated and disengaged.

I've waited patiently for this DVD to finally come out...I go to my local 'Big-Box' store...pull out the credit card...and speed home.    Let me say...what a mess! What a waste of $15 dollars! I'm nothing more than an Auto Parts salesman living in Chatsworth Ca...nothin' more...nothin' less..    I could have re-edited this DVD a whole lot better than Warner Home Video did. Elvis was filmed over 6 nights...the average show was what..90 minutes...six times ninety is what...ok I'm not good at math..but it's a lot of film...    This mess is the best they could do?...why do we need to see Elvis impersonators? WHY??    This DVD is for the serious Elvis collector who has to have 'Everything Elvis' in his collection..    What I recommend is to buy ' Elvis..Thats the way it is...Special edition'...and best of all...it could be found used here @ Amazom for about 5 dollars.    Someone should contact Nicolas cage...I hear he has an extensive collection of 'Elvis' video...I'd like to see that stuff brought back to life...    Ok..it's now a few days later & I've had time to re-think my review about this particular dvd..just one thing I want to ad. Whats up with this 'free' 24 page booklet included with purchase? it's nothing more that a few photos of Elvis that we've seen time & time again, theres not any print in the booklet..    Why not make this booklet a book on 'the making & restoration of this historic performance by Elvis'...??    I threw my book in the trash..
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|A nation with a long history of democracy succumbs to a totalitarian regime, whose stranglehold upon the population is based upon the spread of fear of fictional disorder & terrorism.  Such is the plot of the sci-fi/fantasy/drama entitled \\"V for Vendetta\\" from 2005 that is very apropos for today's world.  The film's main character, known only as \\"V\\" (played by Hugo Weaving), remains hidden behind a mask for the duration of the film, which takes place in a future United Kingdom ruled by an iron-fisted chancellor, Adam Sutler (John Hurt).  With symbols reminiscent of Nazism and similarities with George Orwell's novel \\"1984\\", Sutler has imposed a curfew upon the entire country and has banned anything (books, art, films, etc.) that he has deemed inappropriate; but in V's secret home, V has rescued many works in the hopes that one day, democracy and freedom can be restored.  On a dark November night, V shakes the totalitarian establishment by blowing up a building in the heart of London and goes after specific individuals whom he kills and leaves a trademark rose behind.  A young woman, Evey (Natalie Portman), is caught outside after curfew by government agents, but is rescued by V, who happens to be out.  With her assistance, V gains entrance to a TV station in London and broadcasts an appeal to the nation to join with him one year from that night to witness the destruction of Parliament, but will a nation's population that has been beaten down by an overbearing government and living in fear break their bonds?  Only by watching this film will you find out, as well as the terrible means by which Sutler gained absolute power.    Based upon a graphic novel of the same name by artist David Lloyd, \\"V for Vendetta\\" is a compelling film whose actors were very interesting and engaging.  Though the film received no Oscar nominations, Natalie Portman won a Saturn Award for Best Actress from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films.  The film also received Saturn Award nominations for Best Costume, Best Science Fiction Film and Best Writing (Larry and Andy Wachowski).  This was also James McTeigue's first film that he was director, though he has much previous experience as a second unit or assistant director for films such as \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" (2003), \\"Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones\\" (2002), \\"The Matrix\\" (1999) and \\"Dark City\\" (1998).  His future directing endeavors will hopefully turn out to be as good, if not better, than \\"V for Vendetta\\".    Overall, the 2005 film \\"V for Vendetta\\" earns a well-deserved 5 out of 5 stars and I highly recommend it to every sci-fi/fantasy film aficionado.

The album starts out with some incredible guitar work with Far Cry then transitions to \\"armor and Sword\\" with some nice lee vocals then we go to \\"workin them Angels\\" another incredible song.  The first 3 songs just kick it.  \\"the Larger Bowl\\" a nice change of pace happy go song.  Spindrift was a filler song in my opinion.  But, \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" is worth buying the album just for that track...Freaking incredible GuitarWork by Lifeson!!

B000FP2OPY|2.0|Some scenes are thrilling such as the one when the female ghost killed a man in his car in Pilot (Disc 1, episode 1). What annoys me the most is the sloppy impersonation carried out by the two brothers (main characters) in the show. In all 4 episodes of disc 1, they impersonated all kinds of people such as FBI agents, ATF, etc. They even used fake credit cards! And all they got was a slap on their wrists! This makes the show more like a comic book. Many times, it's so illogical that it's silly funny! There's no seriousness at all.     The qualities are not even. Only 2 out of 4 episodes of disc 1 have some frightening moments. They're Pilot, and Phantom Traveler      I finished watching only disc 1 of season 1. I did not watch the others because it's more like a horror comedy to me. This show worth watching once to satisfy your curiosity

0440238609|5.0|This is a beautifully written trilogy. I was lucky enough to grow up with it. I read The Golden Compass in about 3rd grade and fell in love with Lyra and Pan. Towards the end of elementary I tracked down the 2nd and loved it too. It was several more years before the final one came out, but I read it as quickly as I could get my hands on it. As young as I was, I didn't get the deeper meaning behind the story, but the imagery and the characters were engrossing. Ever since then its been one of my favorite stories. I've probably reread 10 or more time.      What everyone needs to understand that is is not an attack on god and religion as a whole. It is a symbolic attack on the people who take it to the fanatic and dangerous levels. The ones who corrupt the true essence of what faith is supposed to mean. You have to keep that in mind while you read it. *SPOILER* Yes, there is the scene in the final where they let god out of his crystal case and he breaks apart and blows off into the wind. But when you really read the subtexts of the book you see its about releasing god out of the confines man has put him in and allowing him to return what he is truly supposed to be and stand for.      I read it as a child and I certainly wasn't scarred for life with the \\"brutal blasphemy\\". This book is not for the narrow minded who's sole purpose in life is marking what is and what isn't right. If you cant see what the author is truly saying, then this book isn't for you. I can see why parents wouldn't want young children to read it, it does deal with several dark issues. But allow your older children to think and experience for themselves. If they truly believe then a book inst going to effect anything. Their beliefs are going to be tested so many times in life, you will never be able to shield them from all of it.    As to the comments about underage sex, no where in there does it say anything about them having sex. It says they kiss and touch. If you are that depraved and are searching for a reason to find the book disgusting and hateful, maybe thats what you see in it.     Pullman is a wonderful author. His characters are realistic and 3 dimensional. His imagery is better then most I've ever read. The plot is original, intriguing, exciting, and complex. The books are full of adventure. There just aren't enough glowing adjectives to describe these books. They are a great read at any age and good enough to be read over and over. Don't let narrow minded people cloud your judgment.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Must love VERY graphic sexual content and have a sense of humor.  Shortbus touches some real life stories, can be a little depressing if you don't see the humor in it.  Well written, directed, and acted.  I recommend it for ONLY people who are comfortable with their sexuality and the sexuality of others HOW EVER IT SHOWS UP.  Provocative content that has been extraordinarily presented.  This movie is definitly not for everyone but for those who would like it, they will love it.

I went out Tuesday morning and purchased this disc at Best Buy for around $15...what a waste. There are possibly two, maybe three good songs on this disc, otherwise this is a bad cd. I hope for some actual \\"Pumpkins\\" music on their next disc.
B000TFINY6|5.0|With a show like Lost where there are so many vivid colors and beautiful beaches (not to mention women) it needs to be in high-def to fully appreciate it! Thank you disney for stepping up and releasing it on Blu-ray, I just pre-ordered it. I had the enjoyment of watching season 3 of Lost in HD and let me tell you it rocked my socks! sadly I don't own a tivo so I only got to watch it once when it aired on HD. I'm looking forward to finding out what exclusives with be on the Blu-ray version because I read they are putting extra things that won't be on the DVD version. And of course I am drooling at the thought of season 1 and 2 on Blu-ray in the near future! but for now December 11th can't come soon enough!

0316067598|5.0|I think everyone should read this book just because it explains a lot about the situation in Afghanistan.  The book starts off talking about Marcus Latrell's childhood, which is actually interesting in itself as he talks about the oil-economy implosion in Texas and how it affected his family. Anyway, as a teen, he meets a crusty-old guy who trains him to be a Seal (along with anyone else who wants training) for free.<br />Latrell then goes through seal/buds training and becomes a seal.  The next part of the book goes into his mission to capture/kill a high-up leader in the taliban in the Afghan mountains.  Anyone who thinks this will be a simple-minded \\"we good, they evil\\" type of story will be surprised.  This book discusses, in detail, how the tribal system works in Afghanistan and how the tribes interact with the taliban.  This is good information for us to know.<br />This book is a must-read for anyone who likes the navy seals, but other people should read it too.  There is some talk about God, country, texas and bush, which may sort of offend some people, but they should just let it slide and it never is really over-bearing or in your face anyway.  as an atheist/agnostic and bush detractor, i was not offended by any of it.<br />it's a very good story and it sort of makes you think that we might be able to handle all of our problems over there simply by sending in all of our seal teams and sending everyone else back home...

B000P6XU5G|5.0|A famous western that fully deserves it's status as one of the genre's greatest, 'Rio Bravo' is a laconic classic. As a Blu-ray it might not look as stunning as 'The Searchers' but 'Rio Bravo' is still a must have. The plot is simple, the pace is relaxed but there's real movie magic at work here, with a superb cast under Howard Hawks' assured direction. Front and centre is the effortless charisma of John Wayne, he's commanding, funny and even vunerable as the iconic Sheriff John T. Chance. Dean Martin is terrific as Dude, the drunken deputy trying to sober up, he's so underrated as an actor and performs marvellously here. And who can forget Walter Brennan as Stumpy? Add music sensation of the day Ricky Nelson, then watch these men sit round the jail bonding, arguing and even singing a song. The chemistry is amazing, full of humour and wonderful warmth. And Angie Dickinson is absolutely luscious as the Duke's fiesty love interest. So here's a great ol' fashioned classic that has it all. A must see for any movie buff.
0201633612|5.0|I have read this book many times over. I purchased  this book many years ago and I still reference it today. For those  who are interested in OO design this is the best book I have read,  followed by John Lakos \\"Large Scale C++ Design\\".

This book is a definite must for any language, since it will  change the way you view software.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|An all time great that looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray. Want real movie magic and great old star power? This gorgeous classic has it all in spades.<br /><br />Errol Flynn exudes charisma and swaggering confidence as (still) the best Robin Hood ever, easily showing why he's one of the greatest movie stars of all time. And he's backed by a who's who of Warner Bros star roster, with Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as the personification of ruling class reptillian villainy! And it's all in luscious technicolor with a rousing musical score.

B000002LND|4.0|Yeah, I know... It's 2007 and I'm evaluating a CD from 1990. Why ? It's still a great collection of Madonna's hits from the 80s. Yes, there's other titles in here that were also big hits (as others have indicated here on Amazon), but please realize, Madonna is not only a great musician, but also a brilliant marketer. Why make this disc as everyone recalls it; why do the same renditions ? Nonetheless, it's still a great collection of many (but not all) of her early years.
0449227421|1.0|I was pretty disappointed in THE THIRD TWIN.  This novel could have been very good, and deals with a lot of interesting issues related to genetics and the whole \\"nature versus nurture\\" debate.  Unfortunately, Follett takes a black-and-white view of most of these issues, and this book taught me very little about them.<br /><br />The heavy handed political commentary in THE THIRD TWIN was also disappointing.  Follett pretty much makes all the villains out to be right-wing Republicans, implying that conservative views on welfare and gun control are somehow evil.  I'm certainly not against thoughtful political commentary, but Follett makes no effort to do that here.  Instead, he presents all his conservative characters as right-wing caricatures who are hateful, greedy and venal in almost every scene in which they appear.<br /><br />But even if you're a die-hard liberal, I doubt you'll enjoy this novel.  All the twists are fully predictable, and most of the dialog is stilted and expository.  The love affair in this novel is completely unbelievable, and the heroine isn't exactly a sympathetic character in many scenes.  The plotline involving twins is initially interesting, but eventually devolves into a sensationalistic mess.<br /><br />Ken Follett is a good writer, but THE THIRD TWIN is not one of his better efforts.  My advice is to try some of his earlier work, such as EYE OF THE NEEDLE and PILLARS OF THE EARTH.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was by far and wide my favorite T.V. show.  It has plenty of action, suspense, and comedy to keep you hooked.  With it's unfortunate downfall after the first season for budgeting reasons, us fans rejoiced with the production of the film Serenity, which ties up any loose ends.  Regardless of only having one season, the season that was created is very well produced and well worth the investment for sci-fi action junkies.
0060853980|5.0|This book makes my list of top ten all-time favorite books. Not only is it hilarious, it is intelligent and original. I laugh to myself just thinking about the story. I'm wondering why this hasn't been made into a movie yet. I just saw Stardust at the cinema, and had read that book a while back and loved it too. Good Omens would make a fantastic movie too! Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett are a great writing team!  More like this, please!
B000FZERIG|5.0|I fell madly in love with this album almost the very first time I played it, and it quickly became one of my new favorite albums.  Until getting acquainted with this album, I never thought I could love any of George's solo albums as much as ATMP, but I've found that I love this album just as much, and consider it my favorite of his albums apart from ATMP, which should be placed in a unique class all by itself to give the competition a fairer playing ground and to eliminate the inevitable comparisons.  I can't think of a single song on this album that I don't like, let alone love.  Like so many of his other albums, this one just makes me feel happy, calm, emotionally satisfied, joyous, and spiritually aware.  I've also never heard his voice sounding more beautiful than on this album; he even sounds angelic on a couple of the songs.  And not only was his voice in top form on this album, but he was also demonstrating ever-increasing mastery at writing lyrics and melodies both.<br /><br />It starts off with the familiar \\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth),\\" which technically speaking might not be the album's best track, but which is a very soothing song, a heartfelt prayer and plea for more love, understanding, and peace in the world.  \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" is a fun rocker making somewhat humorous light of a rather intense situation, all of the legal battles the ex-Beatles were going through at the time.  Sometimes you have to laugh at yourself in the midst of bad times or you'll go insane.  \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" is one of the spiritual songs, with some very heartfelt personal lyrics.  \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\\" is an upbeat love song, which almost anyone could relate to.  Who has never grown impatient or heartsick while waiting for someone one loves unrequitedly to come to one and start feeling the same way?  \\"Who Can See It\\" might be my favorite track on the album.  It's such a beautiful soaring ballad, at times almost operatic.  I also love the very personal refrain, \\"My life belongs to me/My love belongs to/Who can see it.\\"  The title track, \\"Living in the Material World,\\" is one of the album's strongest songs.  It's a very upbeat rocker, with some great tongue-in-cheek humor, and a variety of musical instruments present, including a flute after the reference to Lord Krishna (who was a flautist).<br /><br />\\"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\\" has a bit of a twangy feel to it, like \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues,\\" and is also a nice upbeat number.  While the religious message is laid on a bit thick here, I don't see it as preachy.  As its essence, the song is merely saying that everything we do, good or bad, comes back to us, and that the Divine loves and helps those who help themselves and do good things.  I fail to understand why some people feel George's solo songs are \\"preachy\\" just because they talk about religious and spiritual matters.  Their messages seem more universal, open-ended, and non-sectarian to me, instead of saying \\"This is the only way to think, behave, and belief, and if you don't do exactly as I do, you're an immoral unsaved sinner.\\"  But then again, I share a lot of the same spiritual beliefs he had, including his interest in Krishna, so perhaps I'm biased.  \\"Be Here Now\\" has rather simple lyrics, and is a quieter softer number.  The message is so basic, that we need to be here now, to live in and focus on the moment, the present, and to stop thinking about bad things we might have done or had done to us in the past.  Being here now is what matters, not living in the past.  \\"Try Some Buy Some\\" is another beautiful soaring near-operatic ballad like \\"Who Can See It.\\"  I think the Spectorisation of this song, with that Wall of Sound, just gives it so much more power and emotion.  \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" is rather like \\"Give Me Love,\\" a genuine plea and prayer for more tolerance, love, and understanding in the world.  \\"That Is All\\" is such a beautiful perfect close to the album, a beautiful soaring ballad that really sums up the entire listening experience perfectly.  Adding bonus tracks, however interesting, after that song kind of throws off the established flow and mood.<br /><br />If one isn't off-put by how a lot of these songs are spiritual instead of rock songs, this would be a great album to get after ATMP if one is just getting into George's solo work.  It might even be a good alternate starting place if one feels overwhelmed by ATMP because of how huge and intense it is.  This album, while having a lot of songs in the same vein, has a bit of a more intimate feel to it because it's smaller.l soaring ballad that really sums up the entire listening experience perfectly.

B0001XAPX8|3.0|I came into this movie knowing that, as has been proven time and time again in the history of novels being made into movies, that the adaptation would of course be an oversimplification of the complexity of the book.  The only question would be how gross the oversimplification would be.<br /><br />Philip Roth's novel is a forthright examination of the thoroughness of misery.  Roth, as perhaps the last among those we can call American Novelists, peers into the American character to see how we all suffer through depths of misery though we look anxiously for an easy lifestyle--we are, after all, Americans.  But [[ASIN:0375726349 The Human Stain]] takes an honest look at everyone, from Coleman Silk, a classics professor pushed out of his university position due to a charge of racism, which he explodes over because he is a man carrying far bigger secrets that are tearing him apart, to Lester Farley, an abusive, dangerous and violent ex-husband who is also an incredibly damaged Vietnam vet.<br /><br />Of course, for this movie, many of the character depths would have to be sliced away for the sake of time.  One of the slices here, unfortunately, is of Lester, which I think is a shame, because that is an immediate indication that the movie is not going to address the breadth of human character than the novel does.  Instead of being a sick SOB that we can actually feel bad for because of his own damage, Lester in this movie (played by Ed Harris, of course--who else?) is quite simply the raving ex-husband.<br /><br />This lack of depth is more unfortunate, considering some of the actrors that are pulled together for this--I mentioned Ed Harris, but also Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman (who has been climbing higher and higher in my ladder of opinion), Gary Sinise--these are actors who could have dealt with the boxes within boxes of Roth's characterizations, but alas the script does not give them the opportunity.  Some good moments, especially between Sinise and Hopkins, but overall a little flat.  A shame.shame.
B000001EGE|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Elton John came in this album with a stunning concentration on every track of this marvelous, strongly produced #1 album, Honky Chateau. When I heard it first I considerated it as simply \\"good\\", but after hearing to it twice that's when I realized how strong, catchy, and even funny album Elton John had the pleasure to release.<br /><br />Honky Chateau contains a lot of enjoyable and familiar sounds through the record, including a lot of folkish compositions, mixing it with classic style pianno ballads and some rock and roll. Along its moods I noticed the album to be very catchy, enjoyable, funny, soft and juvenile, also having some dramatic moments, making it his most comprehensible and easy to listen album.<br /><br />among the tracks each one of them is as enjoyable as the other one, but very original and unique:<br /><br />- Honky Cat: a famous hit song with a lot of folkish sounds and a fresh mood, having a very mellodic electric piano performed by Elton and some ocassional trumpets, perfect for hearing it driving through a lost in the map road in some deep, farm area.<br /><br />- Mellow: a light piano song which is mainly a funny, juvenile song, very simple though, having a light folkish sound introduced when applying the electric violin, although it has its moments.<br /><br />- I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself: another funny, fresh and catchy song, one of my personal favorites, which Elton performes in the perfect way, singing in a freaky way and in a mood just like a crazy man (and I say it in the best sense), also having a fantastic mellody and even having a tap sound part! although the song has its dramatic moment at the end of the second part of the chorus.<br /><br />- Susie (dramas): the song title says it, a dramatic song very alike with Texan Love Song and The Ballad Of Danny Bailey, although a little bit exagerated its a suburban, strong song.<br /><br />- Rocket Man: a long time favorite hit which is the most recognizable track in the album, being a piano ballad mainly focused on piano and applying brief guitars with a semi dramatic mood, its a song much more alike with his past works, and my personal favorite in the album.<br /><br />- Salvation: another good ballad but it goes just too fast being a short song; a couple of more lines in the lyrics would've made it perfect; also the instrumental interlude goes too fast.<br /><br />- Slave: the original version of this song is mainly a song defined by a lot of guitar, banjo and congas, but without Elton playing the piano, which makes the track a little boring. The alternative version is a lot faster and I like it more just because Elton plays the piano and it also features some synthesizers, but the same problem happens like with Salvation; it goes too fast being too short, but enjoyable after all.<br /><br />- Amy: another dramatic song very alike with Susie (dramas), although it keeps its difference for being just a little bit more profound. its the second track to feature Jean-Luc Ponty in the electric violin.<br /><br />- Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters: my second personal favorite, it was a minor hit but its lyrics and composition are very delicate and rythmical. The song mainly spins around Davey Johnstone's mandoline.<br /><br />- Hercules: another minor hit and a song that explodes the best instrumentation in the record, applying one of Elton's best piano performances, it also includes synthesizers, light backing vocals, drums, guitars and even rhino whistle (whatever that is it appears on the performance credits). Its also the most rock and roll alike song.<br /><br />The two greatest highlights in the album are Elton and Taupin outrageously simple but amazing compositions, and the variety of instruments applyied, noticing that this is the first Elton John album not to feature strings (excepting two songs).<br /><br />In conclussion the album its an amazing, easy to listen, delicate, juvenile, fresh composition regarded as one of the greatest Elton John's albums of all time, just \\"a simple classic\\".

I was watching the movie and just wondering what was going on, because really, the last 30 minutes are total non-sense. Let me just say, everyone ends up naked (a huge crowd, probably thousands of people) while he murderer is standing, waiting for his execution. And that's not even the worst part of the movie...<br /><br />That movie is awful. The last 30 minutes ruin it all.
1400044162|5.0|This book is SUBLIME! If you enjoy the fusion of foreign culture, politics and history in works of fiction, this is a \\"must read\\". I enjoyed the Purple Hibiscus, yet there is no comparison to the depths of the characters and plot of this book. The structure (rotating narratives of the 3 main characters and leaps in time) was innovative and worked fabulously to keep the intrigue high. This book is superior to The Kite Runner and other recent works of the genre that have gathered wide acclaim. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is on her way to being listed alongside Naguib Mafouz and Nadine Gordimer.
B000002C2E|4.0|I don't see this as a comeback; so what that his previous two releases were of covers? They were good. And before those, Oh Mercy was a worthwhile album that could have been great (he left off \\"Dignity\\" and \\"Series of Dreams\\" for the likes of \\"Disease of Conceit\\", blecch), and Under the Red Sky, though not brilliant, was badly underrated. If Dylan had a comeback, I suppose I'd trace its beginnings to the Wilburys and Oh Mercy.
0618526412|4.0|The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" is not about complex plotlines. That is not Carson McCullers style of writing. Her works are entrenched in the vivid dimensions of the characters. Understanding the psyche of these souls and maybe even empathizing with them to some degree, is what makes such a novel enjoyable. Miss McCullers style of writing, almost demands that you do.    For anyone who decides to venture into this novel, I have to put in a warning. For me, this has been the most heartwrenching novel I have ever read. I think I fell in love with this book right from its title. Due to some odd reason this title reminds of a line which I have read ages ago. The original line is in malayalam, which roughly translates to \\"Life - An oasis destroyed by memories\\". Hopefully when I get around to writing my first novel, I too will be able to come up with such a eloquent and insightful title.    The central character is John Singer, a deaf mute. The people around him tend to put their worries and questions at rest with him. They see him as a larger than life character who will be able to help through in their times of anguish. But he too is lonely and has his own set of worries.    The beauty of Singer's character lies in how he is able to help those people even though he is unable to listen or talk to them. Because the craving to have someone interesting to talk to or listen to is driven by our brain. But all our heart really needs is...someone.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|I bought this film out of interest in Doldinger's music and in preserving my German language. I bought it a second time after my brother disappeared with my first copy.  The plot, such as it is, is the very essence of sentimentality and cliche: peril faced and overcome; the futility of ardent endeavour; the tragedy of the innocent \\"true believers\\". But the film is superbly made, and the character delineations wonderful (count how few seconds we need to understand Johann -- the chief engineer of the Uboot).
B00003CXUM|5.0|Even though this was on the list of my movies to review, it was not on top of the stack. But today I had a conversation with one of my friends about moral high ground. That prompted me to pick this up.<br /><br />This is an old(er) movie. But not many may have seen it. So this is my way of recommending it to all the readers of this blog.<br /><br />Also in a time where morality seems to be measured by whom (race, gender etc) you love rather than by how you love, this movie speaks volumes.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple. A simple story of neighbors - a man and a woman, who find out that their spouses are having an affair. Somehow this catalyzes a strong friendship between them. And that is the only thing simple about this movie.<br /><br />The treatment of the movie makes the viewer almost feel like a voyeur - lurking behind doors and corners watching them as they keep denying their longing and love for each other. By the latter half of the movie one is rooting for them to shake off these bonds and embrace their attraction.<br /><br />The movie is set in the 60's Hong Kong, a time when women still wore beautiful dresses and men were gentlemen who wore suits and jazz was the preferred genre of music. (I always contend that the world was a much better place when men wore suits and listened to jazz.)<br /><br />One is driven to think \\"Why don't they get together? Their spouses are already cheating on them.\\"<br /><br />That is where their sense of true fidelity and decency comes to the fore. It makes the case that morality is not a relative term. It is a set of ideals that one has to strive for no matter what turmoils surround you. And using someone else's immoral conduct to justify one's behaviour is just a poor excuse for our own weaknesses.<br /><br />'Random Hearts' starring Harrison Ford and the oh-so-beautiful and charming Kristin Scott Thomas, did try to explore a similar subject. But for any story dealing with human emotions, subtlety is the key. And Wong Kar Wai literally gives an education about the art of silent glances and unspoken emotion in this movie<br /><br />My final word on this is a quote from this movie itself.<br /><br />\\"You notice things if you pay attention\\"
1572814349|5.0|Golden Tarot is a favorite tarot deck of many for good reasons. Not only are the production values wonderful, from the gold gilt and box to the card printing quality, but the art is just magnificent. Oh, certainly, there are those who call this \\"derivative\\" art -- Kat Black montaged wonderful masterworks to create tarot symbols very in tune with the Waite system of Tarot symbols. But I don't. I know -- from experience -- that montaging is more difficult than original art when you're trying to make it look \\"original.\\" Kat is a master at this. You'd hardly know -- if you weren't told -- that this is indeed a montage deck. And who cares (if these things bother you)? You can spend hours looking at the images. Since they are also derivative of tarot imagery down through the centuries -- which is important (how valuable is it to have a tarot deck with images that have nothing to do with the archetypal symbolism of the deck?) -- this is an endlessly fascinating and beautiful deck most people will collect, use and treasure. I came across this deck -- along with the other 30 plus decks I've collected -- in the course of 15 years of research into the symbolism, history and legends of the Tarot for my tarot-plotted novel The Last Troubadour. The themes Kat explores come as close to the themes in my book as I found, so this was a delightful \\"on my desk\\" deck. I highly recommend it for fun and pleasure.
B000P0J024|5.0|At first I sat down to listen, but I had to get up and dance around.  To sum my feelings up: this is the best $20.00 I've spent in a long time.  The overall feeling that pours off these discs is pure love and friendship. All of the guys are wonderful to listen to and see.  It is as though I really *did* know George personally.  This is really is a 5+++ star set in my book.
1419550969|5.0|Now that the GMAT has issued a revised 11th edition of the Official Guide for GMAT Review, plus new supplementary official guides for both the verbal and quantitative sections of the test, the case for spending additional hard-earned money and scarce study time on the Kaplan review prep book is not as strong as it used to be. On the other hand, a case can be made. While the questions in the official GMAT books have the advantage of being actual test questions rather than Kaplan attempts to emulate the well vetted questions written by ETS (and recently Pearson Vue), most of the official guides' questions have already appeared in the 10th edition of the official GMAT guide, which means that if you have the previous edition, you won't get much additional questions by buying the newer official GMAT books. Although the new GMAT books offer what the publisher calls \\"improved\\" explanations, many of the explanations for the reading passages and analytic reasoning sections are still useless and circular -- like answer D is correct because answer D is, uhm, correct. (I find the math explanations to be adequate, however.) In addition, because the computer administered test is adaptive, offering harder questions as you continue to get right answers, the Official Guide GMAT book questions won't be representative of the actual mix you will get when you actually take the test, particularly if you are likely to be a high scorer, in which case the hardest 20% in the GMAT book will be more likely to represent the actual questions you will be answering.    Kaplan, on the other hand, makes more of an attempt to offer insightful explanations to test questions, even if their answers are at times deficient. Kaplan also offers advice on test strategy with regard to timing, using process of elimination, and ways of coping with particularly difficult questions or reading passages, which GMAT seems to be reluctant to do. In other words, the Kaplan approach is more like true coaching, as opposed to offering just a bunch of practice test questions. In summary, I would say that this is a useful addition to the preparation arsenal, although the main focus should still be on the official GMAT preparation materials.
034544678X|4.0|A funny, engaging, and sometimes eye-opening introduction to human-canine communication.  This book is less about how dogs act, and more about how they perceive our actions.  It is a great book for first time (and often long time) dog owners.    Just today, a man asked if he could pet my dog.  He said he'd owned dogs all his life.  I told him that he could, and he immediately leaned forward over my dog, grabbed his muzzle, looked full into his face and started smiling at him.  After I got the idiot to let go (he looked very offended) I wanted to hit him in the face with a copy of this book.  It should be a prerequisite read for owning a dog.    If you don't understand why this mans actions were so dangerous, please buy, borrow, or steal this book and read it before you even look at another dog!
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|I think most of the other reviewers already mentioned this, but movie was pretty much impossible to watch because of the camera work.  I saw this in a theatre and actually had to close my eyes for about 10 minutes because I was getting nauseous.  I loved the first movie and had high hopes for the sequel.  From what I could tell, it was probably a pretty good movie.  Too bad the director ruined it with ridiculously bad cinematography.
B000000W5F|5.0|I've heard a few Stones' albums but this is the only one that has grabbed me thoughout. Each song is it's own individual accomplishment, and shouldn't be overlooked just because they are \\"filler\\" songs taken from shelved sessions - Neighbours and Black Limosine are probably the least effective in this sense but are still fun to liten to. Tops and No Use In Crying are very effective in their emotional grasp of relationships with strong catchy riffs and vocals; Heaven is just simply beautiful; and Little T&A and Slaves rock and swagger like they're suppose to.  Stop being critical and just enjoy the songs!
B000QGDIKM|2.0|Machina had a phenomenal theme to its artwork and slip cover booklet.  When I bought the limited edition booklet of Zeitgeist, I expected more and got less.  Outside of pretty pictures and artistic creativity, the limited edition doesn't do much more than the original.  Wait, I'm wrong, the lyrics are in order in the limited edition versus the lyrics being out of order in the original.    Now, Radiohead's Kid A limited edition gave an insight into the meaning behind their album, moreso than the original.  That's a limited edition package worth purchasing.  Amnesiac, too.    Outside of a bigger body builder photo and a more blown-up Paris Hilton in front of a mushroom cloud, this limited edition packaging is all hype.  At least provide some bonus material in either a DVD or bonus disc for the price increase.  I have to think that the paper didn't make this limited edition booklet cost that much more.  It's not worth it and I am a loyal fan.  I honestly wonder if Corgan et al thought, \\"People who will buy this will really like pretty pictures.\\"    Don't buy the limited edition...stick to the original.  It accomplishes the same purpose at a cheaper cost.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|While I've never read the Philip Dick story this movie is based on, I'll have to say this story has some strong points on its own. Nicolas Cage is great as \\"Frank Cadillac\\" or Chris, as he prefers to be called. He can see two minutes into his own future, and this opens some interesting possibilities. It's funny to see him run through several different pick up scenarios before finally finding one that will work with Jessica Biel. This ability also saves his life several times.<br /><br />The storyline moves along at a good pace. While there are some boring scenes, there are enough \\"Wow!\\" moments to keep you hooked until the end.<br /><br />Ah, the end...there's our problem. In an attempt to pull out a great plot twist, we end up with a very cheated feeling. It's almost as if we don't get to see how it all ultimately works out. This could have been fixed with about 5 minutes more screen time, but we don't get it. I'm pretty sure the DVD will probably have an alternate ending in there somewhere because I can't believe this is how they originally envisioned it.<br /><br />As a whole, this was a good movie and I really enjoyed it. It wasn't perfect, and seemed to stumble under the weight of its plot a couple of times (who were the terrorists? where did they get the bomb? Why would a woman like Jessica Biel agree to drive a man she'd just met across the desert...especially when the guy looked like a psycho?), but it was worth the time it takes to watch it.
B00005JODK|4.0|This is the sort of brassy, candy-coated musical to which you either give yourself entirely or not at all because there is little room in between. First, there was the edgy [[ASIN:B00006RZ9Y 1988 John Waters comedy]] followed years later by the sunnier [[ASIN:B00006AALQ 2002 Broadway musical version]]. I thoroughly enjoyed the elaborate stage version thanks mainly to Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman's ebullient music and sharp lyrics and stellar performances from Harvey Fierstein and Marissa Jaret Winokur as a most unlikely mother and daughter in 1962 Baltimore. That most of that high-kicking, watusi-gyrating spirit remains intact is quite an accomplishment for director Adam Shankman, whose previous track record consists of mediocre studio comedies. Adapting Mark O'Donnell's stage book, screenwriter Leslie Dixon seems equally unlikely of pulling it off. Yet, somehow they do and even bring a deeper sense of gravitas than the previous incarnations with the heavier elements of racism and segregation. Starting out his career as a dancer and choreographer, Shankman provides the energetic, in-your-face choreography that is appropriately applied here.<br /><br />The story centers on Tracy Turnblad, a genuinely optimistic teenager, a bouncing bundle of energy obsessed with the local Corny Collins dance show. Living in a working-class neighborhood with her agoraphobic, self-consciously plus-sized mother Edna and her congenial, novelty store-owner father Wilbur, Tracy only wants to dance on Corny's show. Standing in her way is the malevolent Velma Von Tussle, an aging beauty who owns the TV station, and her equally venal daughter Amber. Once a month, the station allows the dance show to have a co-host, blonde-tressed Motormouth Maybelle, who holds a \\"Negro Day\\" to allow the local black kids to dance on their own. These kids seem to end up in detention a lot since Tracy finds them there and learns new dance moves from them. She realizes the world would be a better place if black and white kids were able to dance together on Corny's show. This sets up the story's central conflict, which comes accompanied by romantic complications among the various characters. All of this ends with the Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant and naturally a pull-all-the-stops production number.<br /><br />The casting is inspired. Following Divine and especially Fierstein in the cross-dressing role of Edna is no easy task, but John Travolta brings a surprising delicacy to the character. The novelty of his casting never wears off, but he also does not stoop that much to parody either. Even with a slightly garbled Baltimore accent, he is convincing as a woman who has accepted life's compromises for the sake of her family. Alternating quickly between clever and broad, Michelle Pfeiffer has a field day playing Velma, though she has precious little opportunity to show off her long dormant singing talent. As Maybelle, Queen Latifah seems to be cornering the market on musical earth-mother types and gets her shining moments on \\"Big Blonde and Beautiful\\" and especially on the gospel-flavored \\"I Know Where I've Been\\". Christopher Walken has comparatively less to do as the put-upon Wilbur, though he shows off his singing and dancing skills on his sweet pas de deux with Travolta on \\"(You're) Timeless to Me\\".<br /><br />For all the veteran talent on display, it's Nikki Blonsky who carries the heart of the movie as Tracy, and her sunny demeanor and \\"American Idol\\"-caliber talent keep the story aloft. The other teens - Zac Efron as singing heartthrob Link, Amanda Bynes as devoted best friend Penny, Brittany Snow as spoiled Amber, and Elijah Kelley as Maybelle's son Seaweed - are all played with energetic adolescent brio. Complementing the principal cast are James Marsden as the perpetually smiling Corny and Allison Janney as Penny's Bible-thumping mother. Everyone is in the right spirit, and the pacing and tone are spot-on. The film's one weakness is a certain lack of energy in thecamera movement around the production numbers, as Shankman's tendency is to film key dance sequences intermittently at mid-waist level. The net effect is a reduction in the overall energy level at key moments such as Travolta's Tina Turner-style turn at the end. Regardless, this is fun stuff for those open to this genre.he production numbers, as Shankman's tendency is to film key dance sequences intermittently at mid-waist level.

0380789035|4.0|Neil Gaiman is obviously a lover of mythology and works different mythos ino most of his works.  His skill at re-interpreting mytholigcal figures and weaving them seamlessly into his own narrative is unparrelled.<br /><br /> The premise of this book, that the gods of other cultures were brought by their followers to America, is intriguing.  American Gods shines when the old gods are on stage.  Learning what has become of famous gods, how they get by, and how they feel about their place in the world is fascinating.  The work is also beautifully written.  The characters are brought to life, and even immortals are written with the greatest humanity.  The prose is clear and straightforward but also contains within it a subtle poetry.<br /><br />The reason I give this book 4 stars and not 5 is because of the ending.  It seems Gaiman set up this great world but didn't know where to take the story.  The plot focuses on Shadow, a recently released convict and widower, who takes up employ with a god, Mr. Wednesday.  Shadow acts as a bodyguard and travels with Mr. Wednesday to meet with other gods, whom he is trying to recruit for a war with the new American Gods of capitalism, progress, information, and commercialism.  The story slows down when the focus shifts from the upcoming war between the Gods to the day to day life of Shadow.  Shadow is a well drawn character but is not able to carry the narrative on his own.  There are also digressions in the story in the form of side works entitled \\"Coming to America\\".  These detail the journeys of gods to America from their homelands and bear only a loose relevance to the overall story.<br /><br />Despite its failings as a story this book should be read for the beautiful writing and the inventiveness of the world.  It definitely makes you think about religions of old and the burgeoning religion of America.

1563890119|3.0|The Sandman: Preludes & Nocturnes is the first volume of the graphic novel series of  Sandman comics by Neil Gaiman.  Preludes collects the first eight volumes written.   These follow a quest by Dream, one of the immortal Endless, to recover his powers and his realm, The Dreaming, after escaping a lifetime imprisonment at the hands of an English occult society.  Dream's journey brings him to many interesting locales and forces him to cross paths with other DC characters, such as Scarecrow and John Contantine.    Positive:  * Gaiman is skilled storyteller and each chapter works as a self-contained tale.  He has the ability to quickly create characters we can empathize with and are interested in.  * Comic book lore, pop culture, and mythology are woven together beautifully to create a world that is pleasantly unique.    Negative:  * Gaiman himself admits in the afterword that during this first volume he is struggling to find his voice.  Subsequently, the stories oscillate between occult mystery, dark fantasy, horror, psychological studies, and superhero action.  The quality of the writing wavers quite a bit as well.  * While the individual chapters are engaging, the overall story arc is not.  It is a cliché quest adventure in which Dream must overcame obstacles to recover three lost artifacts one by one.    For Fans Of: modern mythology, urban fantasy, and dark fantasy    Bottom Line: While flawed, this volume shows great promise especially towards the end of the book.  The chapters \\"24 Hours\\" and \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\" would be considered great writing in any format.  Gaiman has set the stage for better things to come in future entries with an engaging character, Dream, and an interesting world.  Though not consistently great writing, Preludes is a worthwhile read.
0385522401|4.0|The two characters in this latest McEwan novel are not particularly notable. It's their situation that this book seems to be commenting on: a time before the sexual revolution of the 1960s in which two young adults could not openly discuss the intimate aspects of their relationship. For someone who was born in the late 60s, it's difficult to imagine a time when such fear of open discussion could lead to the immediate failure of a fresh marriage.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented on the uninterestingness of the characters, but I think they miss the point. McEwan is reminding us of what can happen when society demands that a key theme of human relationships be hidden and shielded. The fact that these two people were caught in the fallout of such a culture and that it ruined their potential happiness and satisfacation is the point.<br /><br />While not my favorite McEwan novel to date (that would probably be Atonement or The Innocent), he does not disappoint with this book. He stays true to his analysis of real, complex human relationships. If that's what you like about his previous novels, you should enjoy Chesil Beach as well.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's the greatest tragedy of modern TV that this show was canceled before it finished one season.  FOX canceled it despite putting it in a Friday night time slot and airing the episodes out of order (crazy, I know!).  These episodes contain top notch visuals, witty dialog, and excellent world building.  The characters are cast perfectly, Nathan Fillion is amazing as Captain Reynolds.    The Extras on these DVDs are excellent.  They are worth picking up for the commentaries alone.  Joss Whedon and most of the cast members contribute to the tracks.  Several unaired episodes also appear making this a must buy for scifi fans, and really lovers of great TV in general.  These stories will live with you long after you view them.  I find myself quoting them all the time.
0060751967|2.0|From all the 5 star reviews I am thinking I read a different book.  This book was beyond terrible.  I kept thinking since it had 5 stars that the book would eventually get better, it never did.  Had I know that I would have never bothered finishing it.  The plot and the main character, Roman, had such potential for a fresh story but in the end it turned into a mess.  The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1, was for the potential.
0385486804|4.0|Delivery was decently quick. Arrived with plenty of time to spare.    As for the book itself, it isn't one of the greatest books i've read.

B000P12LWY|1.0|I have to wonder......did any of those who produced this pile of useless, oversexed and inaccurate drivel ever bother to read a history book? I'm not one of those viewers who EXPECTS BBC like accuracy (Their Six Wives series with the unequalled Keith Michell is still the golden standard) from every Tudor related film. I enjoyed movies like \\"Young Bess\\" and \\"Anne of the thousand days\\", inaccurate though they were. But \\"The Tudors\\" has hit a new low. For one, Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII. He looks more like a skinny, pretty Don Juan wannabe and not like the red-haired, majestic and sophisticated King Henry of history. Yes, Henry wasn't always a fat man, till about 1529 he was a handsome man, strong of muscle and very intelligent. But he was always of a broad built and not the little nothing that we see here. At 6''2 he towered over everyone around him. Nothing of this can be seen here. All we get here is a soap opera reject playing around in inaccurate costumes.    Another thing: Anne Boleyn. Where are her striking dark eyes? Her cutting wit? Her elegance and her French education?    I could go on and on. But it's useless. This is 95% fantasy using the names of people who've actually walked on this earth long ago. With a director saying \\"that Henry's d*ck actually changed history\\", how CAN you expect something tasteful! Disgusting, inaccurate, sleazy and badly cast, directed and acted. In one word: Useless!

I just got this last night in my mail and while I was soooo freakin happy to watch it the only things I will say about it are that the sound fades in and out of good quality randomly. Maybe its the transfer, maybe its the best they could do but it just wasnt what I expected. Oh well, I'll live. My other comment is the same as everyone else, there is a lack of bonus features. The interview with the artist and writer were ok. I liked the original serial episode although I have those already BUT the preview for the new series was a joke. Its nothing but a 5 or 10 sec clip of the logo coming on the screen. Im pretty sure they could have done better.  All in all, its one of the greatest cult movies and it on DVD. I guess I should be happy but I was left wanting more.

I can't say I did not get some good information from Scott Kelby just expected more then received. All camera referances are Canon and Nikon.
B000002KKK|4.0|Much has been written about the re-mastering of earlier ZZ Top titles, with mostly negative comments.  This release, fortunately, still holds up well in its original form for good reason.

Sir Lawrence, though he did not get along with Merle Oberon during the filming, showed so much passion in the B/W version and even Timothy Dalton was tolerable.  Juliette Binoche was boring and silly and my darling Jeremy Northam was hardly visable.

B000UX6THK|5.0|\\"Twin Peaks\\" was the ultimate cult TV show -- suspenseful, complex, hilariously written and with hidden layers that casual channel-flippers might not catch.<br /><br />Though it lasted only two seasons, David Lynch and Mark Frost's classic series is a brilliant piece of television, with dozens of intertwined subplots and a mystery death that goes a lot deeper than just murder. For the very first time, both seasons AND the pilot are united in this box set -- a must have for cult TV enthusiasts.<br /><br />The body of a beautiful young woman, Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), washes up on shore, \\"wrapped in plastic.\\" It seems everyone in the town of Twin Peaks adored her, so her death is a blow. FBI Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) is assigned to the case -- which seems connected to his past work -- so he settles down at the comfy Twin Peaks hotel and continues investigating.<br /><br />And Twin Peaks' secrets start surfacing -- love affairs, madness, wackos, corporate devilry, and drugrunning. And clues about Laura are cropping up: a bloody shirt, a drug deal, a secret affair and a heart necklace. People catch glimpses of a one-armed man and a grey-haired killer -- and Cooper has a prophetic dream with both men, as well as a red room, a double of Laura Palmer, and a tiny man who dances to jazz music.<br /><br />The second season introduces more unrest for the inhabitants of Twin Peaks -- and an injured Cooper (Kyle McLachlan) has a vision that may have something to do with Laura Palmer's death. Midway through the season he finds who it was (or rather, who it SEEMS to be). But that's not the only plotline in the second season -- we also get a psychopathic ex-Fed, parasitic demons, a disastrous beauty pageant, strange caves, and a twin pair of \\"Lodges\\" that seem to exist outside space and time... which Cooper's murderous ex-partner is searching for.<br /><br />\\"Twin Peaks\\" starts off as a basic murder mystery, but rapidly becomes something a lot stranger and more frightening. It becomes a bit weaker during the second season -- especially when Laura's killer is revealed prematurely -- but it's still strange and darkly humorous right up to the flawed cliffhanger end.<br /><br />And Lynch and Frost knew how to spin a great TV show -- they took the usual murder mysteries, and loaded it down with eerie symbolism, creepy visions and inscrutable (but important) lines (\\"Through the darkness of future past, the magician longs to see....\\"). And there are arcs that stretch through the series, slowly unfolding their secrets like dark roses.<br /><br />But it's not just strange-weird, but strange-funny too. And the dialogue has that brilliant quirkiness that most series cannot keep going for long (\\"Fellas, don't drink that coffee! You'd never guess... there was a fish in the percolator\\"). Considering how likably strange the characters are -- including Cooper -- it's not too surprising that it's crammed with quotables (\\"Black as midnight on a moonless night....\\" \\"Pretty black\\").<br /><br />And the characters are VERY odd too. Cooper himself is played with quirky brilliance by McLachlan -- he's a bright, lovable, friendly kind of guy who loves Tibetan mysticism, tape recorders and a \\"damn fine cup of coffee.\\" He becomes even more likable as the series goes on, and we get to see some of his more tragic dimensions.<br /><br />And Cooper flanked by a number of talented actors playing two basic varieties of characters: the relatively normal ones with a slight quirk, such as abusive truckers, the sheriff, teen lovers, and obnoxious FBI agents who offend the residents of Twin Peaks. And the REALLY strange ones, like the weird Log Lady, the one-armed man, the spacey Lolita, and the eerie spirits that haunt Twin Peaks.<br /><br />There are a large number of new extras -- the entire set is beautifully remastered, with documentaries, featurettes, interviews with actors and creators of the series, and other lovely tidbits for the die-hard fan. It's all very nice, the icing on the proverbial cult-classic cake.<br /><br />The entirety of \\"Twin Peaks\\" is hard to even describe, because the plots were a perfect balance of the surreal and mundane -- and the entire series is a dark cult gem from beginning to imperfect end.ks\\" is hard to even describe, because the plots were a perfect balance of the surreal and mundane -- and the entire series is a dark cult gem from beginning to imperfect end.
0316010669|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell expanded his argument through various examples. Insight into events in history as well as inclusion of his own anecdotes provided the momentum that kept the book a page-turner. Blink can easily become a quick read because of its gripping nature. I initially thought his argument was simplistic, but throughout the course of the book, he introduced many layers that made his reasoning much more complex in a pleasant way.    This book is highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand decision making on an often subconcious level.
1582701709|1.0|Zero stars, really. This piece of baloney was bought for me by a friend who heard good buzz about it, and felt it would pick me up when I was down. WRONG! This book is so despicable,for it is morally reprehensible to take advantage of innocent people DESPERATE for salvation, be it economic, or emotional... The only thing that angers me more than this claptrap is the war, which the author is basically on the same level as our war-mongers in power; to hell with honesty,to hell with human beings, money is all that matters, \\"there's a sucker born every minute\\"-- that is the guiding principle which Rhonda Byrne goes by. To hell with HER! This book claims that if you have positive thoughts, good things will happen to you, that its all a matter of \\"the law of attraction\\". NO, things don't work as simple as that, and the only people who would scoff at that are either extremely deluded, or people like realtors, who live as predators on human suffering, and want to \\"maximize their profits\\", despite what it may cost others in human anguish, or at the very least disappointment. This book peddles overly simplistic views, which in fact imply that if YOU are having economic woes, you have no-one to blame but yourself. Uh, it ain't always that way! A LOT of good people fall on hard times, and what's really disgusting is a lot of them will turn to this for their guidance. Folks, positive thinking is a great thing to have, but this book promises magical outcomes! It's ridiculous! I wish I could go into detail like longhorn24, but all I'm able to do is voice my opinion and hope that it prevents someone from being swindled by the scumbag that wrote this piece of garbage. Why is it a best-seller? Because people are desperate, and there's plenty of con artists out there who will do ANYTHING for your money. On behalf of all those ripped off by Rhonda Byrne, I am giving the finger to you Rhonda, you miserable scumbag. You have no morals writing this modern-day equivalent of snake-oil. Yourkarma awaits you in hell. By the way, for amyone reading this, while I never get rid of a gift, it's my principle, I lent this to my best buddy who got me this, and he was so appalled, I'm pretty sure it's in the trash pile at the dump, where it belongs. Recycling is even better; they cut down trees for THIS? Oh man, that's disgraceful. Like this book. KEEP YOUR MONEY FOLKS, it's a CON-JOB.

0060763892|5.0|Anyone who's been a fan of Rollins and his Sigma series has to read this one!!! The historical fact and the imagination of the author combine to create a fast-paced, greatly written, apocolyptic-style novel!!! I only wish he'd write more, faster!!! The ending leaves the reader knowing there'll be yet another installment!!! If you like Rollins, I also highly recommend anything by Brad Thor!!!
B000BYRCH4|4.0|OK this may not be the best movie but I was suprised how much I like it. Beautiful water and women. I've see worst story lines, this wasn't too bad. When I first got the movie, people were teasing but then ended up watching the whole movie with me to the end so its not that bad... Just my .02
0316776963|5.0|I think a lot of people that wrote the bad reviews just din't get the humor, or were put off by him for personal reasons. He makes fun of his own way of thinking. He acknowledges how screwed up he is/was. That is what is so funny. He writes the things we have all thought at some point in our lives. He has one heck of a vivid imagination that leaves your eyebrows raised. I loved all his books, but this one is the best.
0679735909|5.0|I found the weaving together of different styles in this book delightful and utterly satisfying. I'm the sort of person who often has two or three books going, who needs a regular poetry fix, who reads literary criticism with the proverbial grain of salt. If you take \\"LITERATURE\\" super-seriously, you probably won't like the book, because, well, you'll get made fun of. But if you are willing to enter a story with childlike belief and follow the author down unexpected side roads, if you enjoy observing a person's creative work for what it reveals about their character, well, this book supplies all of that. The fact that it has provoked such passionately opposite reviews is, to me, simply an indication that it has substance.

1594489505|5.0|Wonderful book.  Hosseini is really impressive in his technique of drawing the reader right in. Kite Runner was an amazing debut for him, an emotional story of the culture and relationships between men, fathers and sons.  This second novel is geared more toward women, but just as powerful and emotional. It is so much more than the story of two women brought together by circumstance and culture.  It gives us an intimate look, yes, at their culture, but also allows us to see that all people love and need love, whether it is friend to friend, child to parent, woman to woman, it is the same everywhere, regardless of where we are raised, the basic need for love exists, like a nourishment of the soul.<br /><br />In this novel, the reader experiences these bonds and identifies with these emotions, and in fact, long after you close the cover on this book you will continue thinking about it.  Can't wait to see what Hosseini does next.

B00006LPER|3.0|I just watched this film and feel as if I need a shower.  This is an emotionally drainiing film about two very sick and twisted people: the mother and the daughter.  The mother is like Mama Rose in Gypsy, totally focused on her daughter and unwilling or unable to let her go.  The daughter is so damaged she cannot break away from her mother and at the same time is sexually repressed and turns to porno to relieve her repression.  But it really doesn't release her.  At times I felt like strangling that mother but that mother is so sick I felt ashamed at how I felt.    This film will stick with you, whether you like it or not and I'm not sure.  I watched it through until the end (which means I didn't hate it or I would have walked away).  Isabelle Huppert is magnificent (as she always is) and no one plays a repressed woman on the verge of eruption (see La Ceremonie).    Even her feelings about Schubert are twisted.      I still would say it's worth a rental.  You will not forget this movie, I promise.
B000MV8AE0|3.0|I could not give any movie using so much of Beethoven's music less than three stars. Ed Harris does a good job as Beethoven, but the movie focuses way too much time on a fictional character Anna Holtz. She's trying to become a composer. She must fight against everyone's opinion, including Beethoven's, that women can't compose. Beethoven is quickly won over. (There is a funny scene where Beethoven is punctuating his musical  reading of Anna's composition with raspberries, which mimics a scene in Amadeus) She's in love with an engineer, Beethoven thinks anything or anyone which deal with a slide rule can have no soul. Is Anna going to dump the engineer? The movie could could give us a fasincating story on the real Beethoven, but we spend most of time learning about travails of a fictional Anna.     The climax of the movie happens while Anna is helping Ludwig conduct the first performance of the Ninth Symphony. He is taking cues from her on the beat and helping the performers to come in. They cut out way too much of the Ninth, but that is a side point. We watch him watch her be transfigured by the music. It is a good way to express the power of the Ninth. Unfortunately she loses the beat sometimes. So it is a technique that only partially works. The movie also shows Beethoven's estranged nephew Karl's reaction to the Ninth, which helped with displaying the power of the performance of the Ninth.     The movie sort of drifts after the performance of the Ninth. The audience hears snippets of the Grosse Fugue and some other pieces, but not enough. The movie delves slightly into the nature of creativity. What is and is not art, but not very well. There is a good line from Beethoven yelling that music is the language of God and that God screams into his ears and that why he is deaf. There is some other mumble jumble about composing music and religion. I am not sure whether the movie is quoting Beethoven or not.     The movie was enjoyable because of the soundtrack. I put iton the same level as \\"Immortal Beloved.\\" Beloved is more flamboyant and Copying has Ed Harris going for it. My recommendation is to skip those movies and go buy a CD of the Ninth.
B000P0J024|5.0|Since it first came out, I have constantly played Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1.  When the collection came today, I have not stopped playing it and the DVD was priceless.  The End of the Line video is quite poignant seeing Orbison's rocker with his guitar in place of the great singer.    The funniest song on the album is Nobody's Child which caused me to break out laughing.  A great sendup of every plumb pitiful fold ballad (particularly in bluegrass)  I have heard.  Worth the price of the collection.    A collection to treasure.  And Harrison was always my favorite Beatle.
0316067598|5.0|I heard Marcus interviewed on the Glenn Beck radio program.  He is low-key, polite, and he told the most incredible story of bravery and miracles - I ran out to get the book.  What a read.  I find that often I must put the book down to catch my breath.    His story is astonishing, moving, riveting, and also evokes in me great outrage and righteous indignation.  Our media and liberal politicians are nothing less than immoral:  the media for their anti-military bias in reporting and the liberal, politically-correct politicians for sending our brave, fine young soldiers into a vicious, evil battle with their hands \\"tied behind their backs.\\"  How can a soldier fight a war when he fears any action he takes as a warrior will drag him before the courts for murder?  We must get the Beltway boobs off the battlefield, so tragic stories like Marcus's don't repeat again and again.    Marcus's story needs to be read by every armchair general (i.e., politician) in Washington.  Cindy Sheehan's protests would better serve the military and honor her son if she took up the cause of politicians hamstringing our soldiers with their lethal foolishness.
0743496728|4.0|Although this story isn't going to change your life, I found it an enjoyable reading experience and at times looked forward to getting back to read it. I predicted the end 3/4 in. I'm not sure if that happened to just me or if other readers had similiar experiences. However all that in mind, it's definately not going to be a waste of your time reading this tale. I would recommend reading it. I think young woman in particular would get a lot out of reading this novel.
B0001L3LUE|3.0|This is a decent film about a highly important figure from decades ago. It's somewhat flawed, however, in that it's just McNamara's own account. He's the only one giving the last word about himself. And while much of the time he seems sympathetic and highly contrite about the tragedies of the world, there are some moments where his highly educated and knowledgeable facade betrays a certain evil underneath. This is where again, and again, he seems like a perfectly moral man under normal circumstances, but when talking about war he says that things done in war are done wrong because there are no moral rules. What? Where did he get such a blindspot? The history of world is full of \\"rules\\" for war and they always include not murdering and terrorizing civilians to get what you want. His personal \\"fog of war\\" is an utterly despicable excuse. He's part of the rationalizing warmongers who think it's fine to not have morals in the moment. Nonsense. Pure nonsense. By the end I felt like I'd been roped into watching an old man's last ditch attempt to make himself appear decent.
0609610570|3.0|This book did very little for me. Largely, the book is unoriginal and simply restates ideas already presented in tons of business leadership books. This book might as well have been written for the sole purpose of patting prominent CEOs, namely Jack Welch, on the back. You would be better served to bypass this one and just go read something by Welch on leadership.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|The reality of Big Brother has never been portrayed with such precision before.<br /><br />It is a very emotional, and intellectual movie.<br /><br />As someone who lived in the communist block, I like how much the environment and atmosphere resembles that of those times.<br /><br />The thing that struck me most is how closely some of the conversations in that movie are to conversations happening now in the US. It must be due to the fact that trading freedoms for fictional benefits is just an unfortunate weakness in our human nature.<br /><br />The bad parts of the movie are the translation and the subtitles. I understand German but I watched the movie with subtitles anyway and I must say that the translation is pretty bad. Some of the subtitles were too long and flashing too quickly on the screen to read.

B00004RFFS|5.0|This is simply the best vampire movie I have ever seen. It's beautifully done and very true to the heart of the novel it's based on. No movie can compare and no one can compare to Tom Cruise's masterful and perfect portrayal of The Brat Prince, The Vampire Lestat. Tom Cruise thoroughly understood the nature of the character from the mischievous brattiness to the angst, the frenetic hand gestures, the laugh... He captured every last detail of Lestat's nature right down to a pleading gaze when he asks 'Do we forgive each other then?' to a character he wronged terribly. I love this movie totally and absolutely and to me the shining star of this production was Tom Cruise and his thorough and ideal portrayal of the literary super star- Lestat de Lioncourt.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I bought this game with my 7-year-old son in mind; he likes chess and other games that require a bit of thinking and strategy.  Well, the whole family loves it, and we are always looking for time to be able to play.  We learn more about the game and strategy each time we play, for example clever and not-so-clever moves that open or close the board, one´s own pieces, or opponents´ pieces. While our 2 1/2-yr-old doesn´t grasp the rules, we can still play our own version of the game by just placing the neat shapes on the board and finding where pieces fit together.      I highly recommend this game for those who enjoy thinking games, strategy and mind-benders.  I am really glad I bought it!
6305949980|5.0|I saw Nightmare before Christmas for the first time in the cinema when I was just turning twelve-years-old and I felt it was simply the most beautiful of movies I had ever seen. I simply adored it. I immediately fell in love with Tim Burton and his artistry. This is a beautiful movie for both children and adults. The animation is beautiful and the score is simply haunting. Danny Elfman was at his peak in composing the soundtrack for this enchanting fantasy, musical. This movie is simply timeless in it's beauty and in it's tribute to the old Rankin / Bass Holiday specials and Dr. Seuss has become a classic by itself. I don't have words to express the love I have for this film.
B00004RF9B|4.0|I love it: great cast, great sets, great colour, cod-Shakespeare story spin-off (the Tempest), invisible monsters, flying saucers, robots, unique soundtrack.  This really is a must in any sci-fi collection.  It's not erudite, or genre making, but just a great piece of entertainment and escapism.<br /><br />When I bought mine, there was no European version (region 2) available, but the region 1 disc is nice (if you have a multi-region player) as it is double-sided with widescreen (16:9) on one side and academy ratio (TV 4:3) on the other.

B000GIWS6U|5.0|The basic dozen of songs of the BG's 2nd LP was recorded in the second half of 1967 (soon after the BG had finished work on their debut called simply \\"1st\\") and was issued early in 1968 to enter the top 20 (US and UK) in February. The hallmark of the BG on their early albums is their incredible creativity in making memorable melodies, sung in perfect harmonies of the 3 Gibb brothers' vocals. The BG were a British pop group that certainly did not dramatically influence the quick developments of rock music of that time. On the other hand, on Horizontal, one can hear reflections of the new developments, e.g. psychedelia, r'n'b, and time-to-time, interesting sounds come from Vince Melouney's guitar. The creativity of the group between 1967 and 1971 (to Trafalgar) was really great - with the exception of the Beatles, I think only a few other groups were able to write so many tunes that you can preserve in your head at first listening. Of course, the most memorable tunes of Horizontal are the biggest hits, i.e. World, Massachusetts, and Horizontal, which regularly appear on divergent compilations. Superficially, you can take BG's music as a romantic hit pop group. However, the group has the inner power to sound very appealing, pleading and expressive.<br /><br />The remaster of Horizontal is a very delightful thing. You get the whole original LP (total time 36:40 min) both in stereo and mono versions on Disc 1 (73:20 min). The sound is extremely pure and deep and thus to me much better than on the original vinyl. You can admire the outstanding orchestral arrangements which still seem to sound up-to-date. Disc 2 (34:59 min) contains additional melodies, most of them previously unissued. Among them, there are also interesting alternate versions of songs which do not appear on Horizontal (e.g. Swan Song). Some of the tracks sound as superb as those on Disc 1, but some sound inferior and flatter. In addition, Disc 2 offers also another famous BG single, Words. The 20-page booklet introduces details of each of the recordings.<br /><br />Horizontal is one of the masterpieces of the first BG's era (along with Idea, 1st). Although I think that artistically, an even more interesting album is Odessa, I can recommend Horizontal to collectors, to fans of the old BG and to those, whose vinyls are getting poor - they will appreciate this luxurious reedition (and I suspect that the original 1CD recording is probably currently unavailable). The newcommers to old BG should rather buy one of the numerous greatest hit compilations.roduces details of each of the recordings.

B0000640S1|4.0|This is the first film in the Rambo series and is by far the best! Most people know what the Rambo character is all about, but for those of you who don't......In this entry Stallone's character Rambo is an ex army Green Beret who is wandering across the country in search of an old army buddy. He is not welcomed in the small town he comes to and is treated in the worst way by the town's police. Rambo strikes back and rages a one man war on the town and I'm sure before it is all over, they wish they had just let the guy get a little something to eat! Stallone really knows how to make you hate these moronic cops!  Really well done and he has some good supporting characters in Brian Dennehy,Richard Crenna and a young David Carusso! This is Hollywood action and it is not completely believable, but not so unbelievable either. Compared to the sequels it is a masterpiece! The DVD transfer is excellent and it has some very interesting extras.

B000A7Q2DM|1.0|The reason I gave this a 1 star is to capture the attention of anyone considering buying it. I have bought this CD and I do enjoy it. I have just bought a iPOD and tried to rip the CD in iTunes but it does not work. I researched any ways of getting around it like     \\"[...]\\"    Now this allowed the CD to come through BUT now the songs skip like crazy, and WILL NOT PLAY PROPERLY. I also tried to download clone CD and it copied the CD to a blank disc but still skips madly.    Now I have viewed other comments on here and I noticed there are many people with the same problem, but also some that do not have that problem. Maybe it is the newer CD's that are like this.     You know, its pretty sad that out the several 100 CD's I ripped, this is the ONLY one that has gave me this problem. This copy protected thing is complete BS.    Oh! But ya know what. I could just buy it again on iTunes for another $10! That is probably what they want you to do in order to put it on your iPod which is completely BS!! I payed for the damn CD, I shouldn't have to pay again so I can listen to it on my iPod. I won't doing that either, that is for sure.
1594489505|5.0|Very powerful story of two Afghan women.  Although fiction, one reads enough reality in the news today to be able to put this story into perspective.  A well told story of what life was like for the average Afghan woman from the Russian era through to the fall of the Taliban.  The treatment of women is appalling and should make every  woman who has the freedom to marry or not, bear children or not, pursue a career, in short - control her own life, wonder how she has been given so much in life.  A very thought provoking book.

B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Rihanna Fenty is one of those singers that, much like Beyonce, we can't help but notice. Although to be fair, she does not give us much of a choice, having released an album each year since she debuted back in 2005. It seems to be widely accepted that Rihanna has limited vocal talent, but she must be given credit for never really attempting to stretch beyond the borders of her ability. With her latest release, Rihanna proves that she is still capable of putting out monster hits that are supported by a fairly solid group of tracks.    Opening track \\"Umbrella\\" is the kind of song that we all try our hardest not to like. Despite our best efforts, we end up with it playing through our minds ad nauseum until we can't help but love it. Most have complained about Jay-Z's verse at the beginning of the song, however it is not entirely out of place. What does take some getting used to, however, is the repetition of certain syllables in the chorus. To give Rihanna credit, it does sound as though her vocals have improved quite a bit. \\"Push Up On Me\\" carries on the upbeat vibe of the previous song, and showcases Rihanna in her element. An upbeat song, not very vocally demanding, but one that would be very popular in the dancehall. Rihanna's vocals are subtly muffled, blending well into the backing music which may be an attempt to mask her limited range. Nevertheless, in this case it works to her advantage making an overall enjoyable track. \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" is, inexplicably, a personal favourite. I normally am not a huge fan of this kind of song, however Rihanna makes it work in her favour. The beat grows progressively stronger during the bridge and pounds its way through the chorus, giving the song a perfect club vibe and actually highlighting Rihanna's vocal capabilities.    \\"Breakin' Dishes\\" is one of the most widely praised songs on the album, and possibly the one that took longest to grow on me. The verses are quite strong, but the song suffers from the all-too-commonproblem of a weak chorus. The chant-like nature of it should have worked well, but it is odd to hear what sounds like \\"I'm a fireman, I'm a man, I'm a man-e-an-e-an.\\" (She is actually saying \\"I'm a fighta, man\\" but the way the chorus was produced made it come across strangely. If it weren't for the chorus, I would probably agree with most of the positive reviews of the track. \\"Shut Up and Drive\\" once again makes use of over-done driving as a metaphor for sex. There is nothing wrong with the song per se. Vocally and production-wise, it is actually quite good. It is unfortunate that the song be dragged down recycling a metaphor which has been used repeatedly (and better) in the past. \\"Hate That I Love You\\" is the song commonly christened a watered-down version of Beyonce's Irreplaceable. Personally, I see very little resemblance to the aforementioned track, other than the fact that they were both written by Ne-Yo (who is also featured here). The song remains a sweet duet, describing the ironies of a relationship in which they couple are so in love, they hate it.    \\"Say It\\" is a strong contender for the weakest track on the album. Although there is little actually wrong about the song, it suffers mostly because it is simply unremarkable. It's the kind of song that could be performed by nearly anyone and it would sound pretty much the same. The track may have been saved by a stronger vocal performance. It's enjoyable while it lasts, although it may sound a little too happy given what it is saying, but it remains ultimately forgettable. \\"Sell Me Candy\\", in strong contrast, is one of the most creative songs Rihanna has to offer. Like \\"Shut Up and Drive\\", it falters slightly from using a clichéd metaphor, but this track at least puts a fairly unique spin on it. Rihanna's vocals are once again, somewhat masked by the backing music, but again it works to her favour. The song does come across as slightly rushed, however, clocking in at less than three minutes. \\"Lemme Get That\\" is the other strongest contender for weakest album track. Rihanna's vocals sound oddly computerized in places, giving the entire song a bizarre sort of tone. This song strikes me as grating, and directionless. After nearly four minutes, we have accomplished nothing but listening to Rihanna asking her boyfriend to buy her things, while insisting \\"I'm not a gold digger.\\"    Ironically once again, one of the weakest tracks is followed up by the strongest, in the form of \\"Rehab\\". It is commonly known that this track was penned by Justin Timberlake, and really highlights his writing skills. The song is far from complex, yet it is enjoyable nonetheless. Rihanna's vocals fit the song impeccably, complemented nicely by Justin's backgrounds. That is, other than his apparent attempt, mid-song, to usurp the glory by singing a couple of unnecessary lines without Rihanna, and which have little to do with the rest of the song. However, this does not disrupt the flow too much, so it is excusable. \\"Question Existing\\" is one of those odd songs that try far too hard to be deep, and end up somewhere closer to nonsensical. The song is saved by the dreamlike quality of the production and vocals, giving it enough appeal that the lyrics scrape through passably. Toward the middle, we hear Rihanna read a diary entry explaining the problems with the music business, in which she uses her real name (Robin). It's a nice touch, adding some semblance of sense to an otherwise rather incoherent set of lyrics. The album ends off with a highlight, the title track, which is commonly believed to be a commentary on Beyonce and Jay-Z. This song truly highlights Rihanna at her best both in terms of vocals and production. Regardless of who this song is intended for, it ranks up as one of Rihanna's best in her career, and is a wonderful way to end the album.    Overall Mark: 4/5    While Rihanna's first album was patchy at best, and her second a mere step in the right direction, Good Girl Gone Bad highlights Rihanna at her best. By now, we are all well aware that Rihanna is not the strongest vocalist, nor is she known for her deep lyrics. However, this collection of songs showcases her strength for using songs that show off what she can do, rather than masking what she cannot. Rihanna has said that she intended to make this a fun, upbeat album and she has done just that, with enough slower tracks to keep her it balanced. It is the sign of a pretty solid album when even the missteps are generally listenable, although I would have been satisfied if \\"Lemme Get That\\" and possibly \\"Say It\\" were removed, although the latter is tolerable. I wouldn't say that Rihanna is on par with Beyonce just yet, but if she continues in this vein, she may be well on her way.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I gotta admit, I am a 007 fanatic. I love the movies, and the stories.  I think there is something cool about someone who works hard and plays hard all with some class.  The movie does not rely upon ridiculous gadgets to grab your attention. Rather, Bond and his wits and brawn are what gets you drawn into the story. So unlike Pierce, Daniel is a Bond who can get everything done on his own as Bond. The villains are not ridiculous either. We aren't treated with some villain who received some new medical treatment to switch his nationality. No we have villains who are impressive, but not wholly unbelievable.  The story is great, and even includes some betrayal of Bond and the brits.  All in all, the movie does a good job of setting up Bond's development, as well as proving his worthiness as a hero. Good Job again for Bond!!!!!!!!!
B0000033RY|5.0|This is blues-based rock by virtuoso musicians in their relative youth. They are still putting out great stuff today, and a recent live performance in Detroit tore down the house.
B000QXDED6|1.0|The reviewer who wanted to know when it was over was more lucky than I. I could not fall asleep during this huge waste of time. I got this one expecting to be entertained, but I was bored almost to death. It was so bad, and so overdone that is was amusing, not entertaining. The characters were cartoonish, and a waste of creative energy. Anyway, avoid this horrid thing, please. There are many better things to do with your time, like mow the grass, wash your shoes, count the flowers on the wall, or play solitare with a deck of 51. You will be distracted by many of the special effects and brought to the threshold of a migrane. It simply fails to live up to the expectations that have surrounded the movie.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|I bought this movie after my purchase of a Walz cycling cap caused my wife to say, \\"You really need to see breaking away.\\"<br /><br />Ostensibly a cycling film, the story is centered on four friends who've made a pledge to waste their lives together after high school. The lure of the real world is too strong, though, and they must choose between rising to the various challenges they face or falling back into a life of obscurity and regret. It's all about the journey for these four young men.<br /><br />But don't worry, cyclists: In addition to all the heavy stuff in the preceding paragraph, Breaking Away also features lots of fun on two wheels, plus an edge-of-your-seat bicycle race or two. All in all, a fantastic movie.
069111966X|5.0|I was turned onto this book by my boss.  And it was a very good recommendation.  I have had my group read it and even those in the group who were sceptics have been converted once I reminded them of the methods they used to sucessfully complete their projects.    If you want to figure out how to fix a satellite dish, program a piece of software or some other thorny problem, read this book.  It will help.
B000AWYOGE|3.0|When it comes down to horror movies, you can either have the types that are more preoccupied with portraying creepy atmospheres and foreboding tension. But then you get the type, which is kind of where we're stuck now, where violence is emphasized - more specifically, graphic carnage-like violence. So when you see a film like Dark Water, you get the feeling that you're going to watch the former right? Well turns out you're getting something a little different and if you're aware of this before watching you might like it.    Dahlia Williams is a recently separated woman in a custody battle with her husband over daughter Cecilia. Getting an apartment on Roosevelt Island, Dahlia's problems seem to get worse as the apartment is in rather poor condition, notably a leak in the bedroom. But then, Cecilia starts to talk of an imaginary friend and the apartment upstairs seems to be frequently full of movement and water. But with a husband out to gain sole custody, is she just made out to look crazy or is there something upstairs?    Watching a horror film, you genuinely want to feel creeped out and almost be on edge. I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt strange after watching a horror movie, like noises aren't just simply noises and whatnot. Dark Water on the other hand is not a horror movie so much as it is a psychological kind of film where it's a more slower-based tension and relatively light on jump scenes. In fact, what little scares there is they feel somewhat, excuse the pun, \\"watered down\\", as if the studio didn't want the film to be too scary or more focused on boo scenes than atmosphere. While the film does have a more slower pace which is rather atypical of the more wham-bam style that we've been seeing lately but it feels like a psychological film mixed with a horror film but trying to figure out which one to use when. As such it feels sort of disjointed and pulled from 2 directions.    But just because it might not fit a horror or thriller genre doesn't mean it has to have bad acting too. Led primarily by Jennifer Connelly, she's given the most screen time and luckily she's sympathetic and able to lend gravitas to a character when they're normally known for being either shrieking violets or just sad sacks that cry all the time. It helps too that she's supported by known character actors such as John C. Reilly (Boogie Nights), Pete Postlethwaite (Usual Suspects) Dougray Scott (Mission: Impossible 2), Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs) and Camryn Manheim (tv's The Practice). They're not really flashy roles but they don't feel useless either.    Is it a film that you should check out? Well, that is if you know what you'r'e getting into. Wanting to see a horror movie, or a character-based psychological film? If it's the former, you'll be disappointed but it's the latter you might find that you'll like it.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Only about once a year a movie is made that stands apart from the rest. In 2004 it was Collateral. Michael Mann is one of two directors that can combine Action and drama with such a stylish feel. Luc Besson is the other . The soundtrack for this movie is also great the part at Club Fever when you hear the beat of the music you know you are about to see a great action sequence . I also really liked the lecture that Vincent gave to Max in the cab after Club Fever. Someday.. someday my dream will come you just push it into memory and sit back on your bunko lounger getting hipnotized by day time TV. Suddenly you are old . It`s all turned around on you. It didn`t happen. It didn`t happen because you were never going to do it anyway. .....  powerful words. I also had a dream like Max and I know it sounds crazy but hearing that made me get it in gear and make it happen.  Life is short one day it`s gone were all just lost in space after all.
B00004U45G|5.0|Down low, high & tight, this has got to rate up there among the greatest live rock recordings.  Only The Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\" can match the tight licks and loose grooves of this gem.  A classic that not even Zep could match live.  Where's the DVD?
0743289684|5.0|I highly recommend this book if you're interested at all in learning more about Islam and the struggle of Muslim women. Ayaan Hirsi Ali grew up a Muslim, living in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Kenya before she finally escaped to Europe in her early twenties. The first half of the book talks about what life was like living in Muslim countries - especially for women. Ali was a strong believer in Islam, even learning with the Muslim Brotherhood for a time before she began questioning why women were not treated equally if Allah was so just. She would often ask questions of her elders, but the answers never seemed, to Ali, to be based in reason.<br /><br />Ali spent many years searching for answers before her father arranged her marriage to a Canadian man. Ali tried to get out of the marriage but her father wouldn't allow it. At the time it was difficult to get a visa to Canada because of the civil war in Somalia so Ali was sent to Germany, where it was safe, to await her visa. While there she decided to run away to Holland, a country she knew to be sympathetic to refugees. There she began truly to believe that women should be treated equally, and saw that it was possible. This began her struggle to bring to light the brutality of Islam on Muslim women. In the book she talks of her own excision (female genital mutilation, or circumcision). She also describes many other women and the struggles they faced as their countries broke down into civil wars.<br /><br />Ali is one of the first women to have spoken out about these issues and her life has been legitimately threatened for it. A close friend of hers was murdered in broad daylight by an Islamic fundamentalist because he made a short film with Ali that depicted the plight of Muslim women. When the police arrived they found a letter stabbed into the director's chest. It was addressed to Ali, saying she would be next.<br /><br />Seriously, this book will help you to understand so much more about Islam, something I fear we are all a little ignorant of, myself included.<br /><br />Also, if you're interested in checking out the short film (10 minutes long) it's called \\"Submission\\" and comes up when the word is googled.ttle ignorant of, myself included.    Also, if you're interested in checking out the short film (10 minutes long) it's called \\"Submission\\" and comes up when the word is googled.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I still remember watching this in the theatres when it came out and getting this DVD brings those memories back alive.The story is about a group of middle class families and their kids who live near the boon docks of the city<br />but now the families homes face foreclosure.The kids who don't want to leave find a map hidden in one of the kids home attic to a pirates treasure hidden somewhere near the town and deciding to have at least on adventure or as they call it a last Goonie adventure to try and find the treasure.Along the way they will have a run in with an escaped family of criminals who have hidden out in the towns abandoned shack near the ocean and unfortunately the entrance to the pirates cave the Goonies need to get into.This is one of the great 80's movie I loved,grew up with,and still remember lovingly to this day for those who grew up in the 80's definitely<br />buy this and for those who are looking for a great family,funny,action adventure movie highly recommended...
B000NVIXDW|5.0|What a great change in the music scene to have this CD by Michael Buble,in the  style of a Sinatra/Martin/Davis. Finally music you can listen to a hear all of the words and music.  Michael is a class all of this own.  Need more like Michael.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|This movie is non stop thriller, starting out with action, and ending with action.  There are a lot of twists in this one.  Mark Wallburg is a Sharpshooter who retires after a mission on which his spotter gets killed.  Three years later he is pulled into consult on a possible assasination attempt on the president, and gets involved in a conspiracy of unimaginable proportions.   Mark Wallburg has been an underated actor for years, but should be given more credit because he takes roles he fits well.  This is a great suspense thriller/action film that you should take some time and watch.  Worth a purchase also.
B000E41MS6|5.0|This was really more than I even expected coming from someone who had never seen the show before. The acting is great and the plots are so fun, the extra features are worth a watch too. I recommend this to anyone, it was really addictive.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|No really, in the course of the movie, I counted four.  It is a great movie.  Oh, and unlike the cover of the DVD would lead you to believe, Audrey Tatou plays a mostly minor role in this film.
0316067598|5.0|Regardless of your political stance on our current military commitment in the Middle East, it is hard not to be moved by this frank tale of struggle and survival by US Navy SEAL, Marcus Luttrell.  Luttrell and his small SEAL team were caught in a firefight in Afghanistan and Luttrell was the only survivor (by a hair!).  Taken in by the nearby Pashtun tribe, Luttrell barely stayed one step ahead of Taliban capture before he was rescued by US forces.      LONE SURVIVOR grabs you by the throat from the opening pages and refuses to let go during an incredible tale of bravery, sacrifice and heroism.  A page-turner that is hard to put down, Luttrell's account of SEAL training gives you insight into this unique band of warriors and the reason for their own sense of near invincibility.   But thank God our country has warriors such as these defending her and the liberties we all enjoy.     Incredible!      Deserves SIX stars!
B000NVIXDW|1.0|Stick to the originals, Everything I've heard of his is boring and bland. Try some REAL sinatra, or The REAL drifters, or the REAL Clapton. It seems that the only reason people buy this is because their friends do, not be cause they like music. Pop Standards covers are always boring.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Right before work one day, I was flippng through the channels on tv. I stumbled across my so called life. I heard about it but never saw it. It happened to be the pilot episode that was on. So, I got a chance to see it from the beginning.  After seeing only a few minutes of it and having to leave for work, I told myself I would look into buying it on DVD.     I bought My so called life on DVD and I can not begin to say how incredible it is.   The show is written and acted in an incrediblely believeable way, that no matter who is watching, you can understand the characters and their emotions. It's realistic without being over the top.   Watching the show, I could remember what growing up was like and could replay the emtions that I felt as if I was her.     I have to say I am very sad that it ended. I am happy that at least Angela knew that Brian had feelings for her.  I am glad that at least they gave us that much.     If I could continue the show, Angela would realize how incrediblely attractive and smart Brian is. She would realize that she is wasting her time with Jordan. She would tell Brian that she loves him and they would get together.    The final espisde would show Angela and Brian, later on in life, married with two kids. You would see Brian come into the house from work with his briefcase, saying \\"Honey, I'm home\\"  Angela would come to the door and kiss him hello. They would enter the kitchen. In there would be  her teenage daughter. Her daughter would be talking about a boy that she likes.  The last thing you would see is Angela shaking her head asking When am i going to meet him? Just like her mother used to.  Perfect ending, what goes around comes around.  At least we know they end up together.
0738206709|5.0|I ordered this book from Amazon because I had just ordered Linus Torvald's book Just for Fun and this book was also recommended.  I am glad I did.  Torvald's book was really fun to read and it really created an interest in the Open Source software phenomenon that I have heard about, but had mixed feelings about it for a few years.  Rebel Code added to Torvald's account, a rather complete history to the whole phenomenon. The book covered elements that I have heard in the news, but wouldn't have come to mind, like the entry of IBM, the role of Novell, Sun, etc.  As each important piece of software was discussed, some seemingly small like GIMP, DNS and Sendmail, the author paused to give a short bio of the author and how they each stumbled into this FOSS world, some quite accidently. There were so many fascinating stories, I am going to hold onto this book.

B000O178BY|1.0|I awaited this with great anticipation, and to say I was disappointed is quite the understatement. In an attempt to support the whole futuristic theme, track after track is laden with seemingly endless electronic robotic noises - making every song sound exactly the same. The whole concept album thing is not revolutionary in the least, and the fact that every song hacks on the government isn't neat or cool or clever or demonstrative of any type of deep thinking. It's riding what the band thinks will be a profitable wave like many, many others before them. How about something positive? Of course not, positive things don't sell. How about at least something original with even a small degree of genuine musicality?

0823023494|5.0|I have been looking for a book on character design since a long time since I am a student of animation. I saw this book in a bookstore and started flipping pages and seeing what kind of lessons it has. My first impression for this book was really great and after reading reviews I confirmed that my impression was not wrong. The book also has assignments in each chapter and this is the best way to learn. The book shows you different aspects of character design and how different rules like shape, size etc could effect the design. The best part is that author never limits you to any particular idea, he wants us to experiment more and more and what to go beyond what is in the book. This is highly appreciated. I highly recommend this book.
B00005JPFF|1.0|That should about sum it up.  Did this movie really need to be 143 minutes long?  I've never fallen asleep in a movie theater before.  First two Spider Man films were fantastic, but not this one.  I remember when Sandman would morph into a giant, shapeless form of sand and glide away:  Was anyone else thinking Imhotep?
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|I hope you are not looking for a movie that is a totally new storyline.  This movie doesn't really dwelve deep into a story.  It is actually quite political and for those paying attention their are some jabs at the current administration.  I wont get into that part but it is there.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed was the almost constant action.  It was intense from the get go without being overly violent.  Mark Wahlberg is an excellent actor and that is evident here.  The movie starts with soldiers on a top secret mission.  Wahlberg is a sniper and his spotter gets killed in the first part of action.  This causes Wahlberg to retire until he is called back into action by the US government.<br /><br />The movie doesn't get stale at any points and is constantly moving.  You don't need to put much thought into anything that happens since it is explained well.  The movie goes from location to location all over the United States and has a climatic almost predictable finish.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun action movie where you can get into the intensity this is it.  I would say this is a must have for any action afficianodo.  Also it's almost a must have for anyone with a home theatre set up.
1878424319|4.0|Recommeded to me by a friend, the book gave you something to think about regarding life, and I even recommended it to others and the ideas came in handy to another friend in need. I would definately suggest anyone having a rough time to pick it up. It can be repetitive at times, but eventually, the writer gets his point across.
