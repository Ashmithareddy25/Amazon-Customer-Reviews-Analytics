B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game is lots of fun, the graphics are great however, after reaching levels 20 &amp; 21 problems begin. The game stops and you keep getting kicked out.  Over frustrating!
B00005RHGL|5.0|I havent seen this movie since I was a kid but its still just as great as I remember .
B00992CF6W|4.0|add some wolf's I have 13 bones just siting there in my chest please update right away!<br /><br />Just update update update update!!!!!!!
B008RNGCAO|5.0|A great collection giving Bane the spotlight.  He is a great villain, and reading it shows how much the movies and cartoons have been inspired by this series.  My only complaint is that some stories are left out.  Apparently the riddler gets a hold of venom, which sounds awesome, and Bane breaks killer croc's arms, but this does not include those stories.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like that the game is difficult enough to be challenging but not too hard that one becomes frustrated and wants to give up. You just have to keep searching for the clues.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this app!In this game  you run and catch the bananas!The goal of the game Is to become minion of the year .That's why I like this game.It was fun to explore the world of despicable me 2
B003O85W44|5.0|One of the best albums I have heard in a very long time! I have it in all formats but really enjoy the vinyl. The group really is amazing!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The app after the July 2013 update is very annoying. The older version was much more functional. I do not like the ads or these &quot;points&quot; we are supposed to collect.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|According to LG Electronics, FOX and Lionsgate have some defective discs out there.  They referred me to [...]  for a complete listing of movie titles.  This is one of those defective discs -- unfortunately if you call FOX they deny it and tell you that it's your machine.  Updating your blue ray player will NOT fix this problem;  it's FOX.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has an incredible gift of keeping one rooted to the twists and turns of this story. As you get down to the end,you know what the end is and can't stop reading till you confirm your suspicions. Terrific story Great Author
B001R3YRG2|5.0|This was a great movie that I saw years ago and then my son said he watched in psychology class.  We decided to buy it and watch it again.  For being an older movie it was still fresh and not dated.  The movie came fast, brand new and without any problems.
B005HI7MRE|5.0|Awesome.  Great music by a great band. Its so good to be able to find this, I had a copy on cassette back in the day!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is truly an excellent book! The great characters and tight plot hooked me right from the start- each section gets better and better. I would recommend it to nearly anyone, no matter what genre they typically read. I am so glad I found it (through Amazon recommends on my Kindle) and so glad there are more Silo books! Thank you, Mr. Howey for creating this series! I can't wait to read the rest of the Silo Series!
B0002XNSY0|5.0|You love mondern military films, you will have this in your library.  You will probably also have fail safe, by dawns early light, etc.  This is suppose to be a dark comedy, it is also darkly realistic.  Signed, William J. Price
B002H5JHUA|4.0|Enjoy the story and acting.  Great mixture of the old horror classics.  Amazon Instant Video streamed poorly to my tv.  Ruined some of the visuals of the movie.
B00DUCXFUC|3.0|■■ Just a Heads-Up, Amazon has merged reviews for The Dark Knight Trilogy, and the Dark Knight Trilogy Ultimate Collector's Edition (UCE). This is a review for just the UCE. I also have a review for the Dark Knight Trilogy which can also be found here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Y6HWBZGPF2K/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009JBZH54&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />If you're reading this, odds are you already own at least one of the movies included here. Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy stands as one of the best, and most successful comic book screen adaptations of all time. Warner has released, and re-released these movies several times over the years. Unfortunately, previous Blu-ray releases have not been perfect. The picture quality left videophiles wanting a remastering of the films (well at least Batman Begins and TDK), but sadly after such a long wait, Warner will be releasing the same exact transfers found in previous Blu-ray releases.<br /><br />There are just a few new items included. You'll be getting 90 minutes worth of new extra features on a bonus disc, including an interview between Nolan, and Superman director Richard Donner, as well as a documentary about the trilogy. Physical extras include 3 Hot Wheels of Batman's vehicles, some Mondo art cards,  and a hardcover book.<br /><br />The discs aren't stored in regular Blu-ray cases, but rather in a \\"Book\\" with slots for each movie. This is similar to the Book-style packaging seen in the Alien Antrhology, and Star Wars Complete Saga sets. Some people may not like this as it doesn't protect the disc as well, but Blu-rays are more scratch-resistant so if you take care when removing and putting them back in, they should be okay.<br /><br />Discs<br /><br />Disc 1 Batman Begins Feature + Special Features<br />Disc 2 The Dark Knight Feature<br />Disc 3 The Dark Knight Special Features<br />Disc 4 The DarkKnight Rises Feature<br />Disc 5 The Dark Knight Rises Special Features<br />Disc 6 Bonus Disc of New Special Features (details follow)<br />Plus: Ultraviolet Digital Copy code for all 3 Movies<br /><br />(Full details of all the existing Special features included here can be read in my previous review found on [[ASIN:B009JBZH54 The Dark Knight Trilogy]] page)<br /><br />NEW Special Features:<br /><br />■ The Fire Rises: The Creation and Impact of The Dark Knight Trilogy - The inside perspective on the fascinating story behind the creation of one of the most celebrated franchises and how it changed the scope of movie making...forever. Full of never-before-seen footage, rare moments, and exclusive interviews with Guillermo Del Toro, Damon Lindelof, Michael Mann, Zack Snyder, Richard Roeper and others.<br />■ Christopher Nolan & Richard Donner: A Conversation - For the first time, Directors Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy) and Richard Donner (Superman) sit down to discuss the trials and triumphs involved in bringing the two most iconic superheroes of all time to the big screen, and how Superman influenced Nolan when developing Batman Begins.<br />■ IMAX® Sequences: The Dark Knight; The Dark Knight Rises - See your favorite scenes as they were intended in the original IMAX© aspect ratio<br /><br />Exclusive NEW Memorabilia:<br /><br />■ Premium Mattel Hot Wheels Vehicles: Batmobile, Batpod and Tumbler<br /><br />■ Newly commissioned collectible art cards by Mondo featuring Scarecrow, Joker, Bane, Harvey Dent, and Ra's al Ghul<br /><br />■ 48-page hardcover book featuring production stills and behind the scenes images from all three movies<br /><br />So is this worth the $100 suggested price? If you already own the movies, I'd have to say no. The cars are made by Hot Wheels, and are probably just a few steps up from Happy Meal toys, and if you want a book on the trilogy, I recommend the definitive [[ASIN:1419703692 The Art and Making of The DarkKnight Trilogy]].  While it isn't quite as \\"Ultimate\\" as the name suggests, newcomers, and die-hard fans will still find some things to enjoy here. Everyone else will be better off saving their money and getting the standard trilogy set, or the individual releases.
0865479410|4.0|The first 1/2 or so of this book he lays out the argument of why many of the 'Positive Thinking' schemes just don't work. The second half he talks about things that in his opinion, do work - such as Buddhism and Eckhart Tolle's suggestion of living in the present moment. I found the book very entertaining and well written. It helped that I agree with him that there is something to Buddhism and Eckart Tolle's books and that movies/books such as the Secret were comically useless as far as self-help.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|but after I increase a bid or add a new item and go back to the buying page it doesn't refresh I have to go out and back in to get it to do that so I am not crazy about that.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Took too long to load, froze up half the time I played it.  Gameloft has trouble with making working games.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I don't like this case because I am not able to hear and my calls were often dropped.  I received one as a birthday gift a year ago; and it worked great; however it's worn and this is why I decided to replace it.  Would like to return it for credit; however, I have misplaced my receipt.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I don't even know how to review this book because there's really nothing to review. There's no plot. The writing is atrocious. The characters are predictable and forgettable.
0440246318|5.0|the story is so consuming could not put it down love Jack cannot wait for the next one Thank you Lee Child
0399246665|5.0|Eric Carle is wonderful and we were so happy to add these great books to our collection.  They are full of ways to ask questions of your children to engage them in the reading and discovery process.
044024630X|5.0|The story keeps you in there till the end superb,Jack is so lovable and caring for the down trodden people
B002VX0A40|5.0|We bought a very large selection of the lamaze developmental clip toys for our son when he was born and Dee Dee was the one he gravitated the most to.  She's a beautiful pink and her wings crinkle loudly.  Her legs are a fuzzy felt and she has a great little rattle.  Her tail has a piece of reflective paper in it but you really can't see anything when you look at it.  She was a great addition to the collection.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series, can't wait until the next season is available (will be a long wait for us to be free:(
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|Anyone that likes metal will enjoy this immensely.  Rob Halford<br />definitely still has those great vocals he is so well-known for.  I<br />have already watched it 3x since I got it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. The only complaint is that the demo is very short. Where are the other levels? It really makes you think...
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I was play on my kindle fire one day than the next day it stop loading and I try deleting it and downloading it but still it won't work.
B007JE7UK8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading what went on both on set and historically as well as reading the edited out scenes in their rightful place - love it!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it was terrific! I have read several books by Blake Crouch and I've loved every one!! Once again, this story took me to a different place!  I can't wait to buy the second one in this series when it becomes available in September!
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|This album is an amazing collection of songs with inspired lyrics and a few really beautiful gospel like songs (That's What's Up/I Don't Wonna Pray/Mayla). I have listened to this CD almost daily for the past 6 months. I highly recommend it as every song on the album is solid. Best album I've heard in years.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|what a fantastic story, what a fantastic book, couldn't put it down, characters well written, look forward to the next book
B0063IH60K|4.0|The actual app is quite good, one of the better incarnation of solitaire out there. My only issues the volume of ads the app pumps out, after every hand you have to cancel the ad window somehow.<br /><br />I understand they need to make money and I support ad based software, however the ads on this game go overboard.
1781162646|5.0|At 283 pages, and more so by Stephen King's standards, Joyland weighs in as a lightweight. But make no mistake, there's plenty of magic here as King expertly spins multiple sub-themes throughout his latest \\"whodunit\\" mystery thriller.<br /><br />The setting, as you can probably guess, is the carnival/theme park known as Joyland. With this carnival setting, King masterfully evokes feelings of nostalgia. It works like a charm. Unless you grew up under a rock, you too were once a \\"cony\\", seduced by the flashing lights, the hypnotic sounds, and the smell of fried dough. The summers seemed endless, while our two dominant internal forces were either that of youthful lust or heartache. Time is slowly withering away these feelings, but King brings them right back in the first half of Joyland. I couldn't help but to put the book down at times and reminisce, always with a smile on my face.<br /><br />We're quickly introduced to college student Devin Jones, who is telling us this story in retrospect. Devin has just been unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend, and decides to spend his summer as a Joyland employee in an effort to get away and forget. As a main character, Devin shines; he's instantly likable and relatable. He's diligent and respectful while plagued with self-doubts and insecurities. He's unsure of his place in this world, as most young men are, yet he carries himself well and commands the respect of his friends and co-workers. His vulnerability is appealing, and among the themes to this book is this interesting young man's road to self-discovery.<br /><br />Take one example of how effective King is with this setting and the friendships that develop: when Tom and Erin (both college summer employees too) leave Devin for school's fall semester, a part of me left with them. I couldn't help recalling my own goodbye hugs and handshakes that came with every summer's end as a student.<br /><br />But there's more to Joyland than meets the eye. Years before, a young woman named Linda Gray was brutally murdered during a Horror House ride. The case has gone unsolved and it's been said her ghost still haunts the ride, occasionally being seen by riders. This apparent ghost story gives way to a crime/mystery story and along the way we're introduced to two more exceptional characters-- a young crippled boy and his over-protective mother. What unfolds thereafter is surprisingly moving.<br /><br />Underneath the Hard Case Crime billing, this is a book about letting go and moving on, acceptance, remembrance, and ultimately, redemption. You wont soon forget it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app worked fantastic! I went from having 4 hours of sleep a night, which I had been feeling with for over 2 years, to a full, restful nights sleep. I recommend anyone giving it a try and seeing what it can do for you.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have to admit that I am a fan of the Harry Bosch novels.  I find the stories very interesting and the often crooked path to a solution intriguing.  It gives me an appreciation of the hard, time-consuming work it takes to solve a crime. Michael Connelly always delivers a &#34;good read&#34;!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|one of the few television programs of recent times that I like, and I like it a lot.  having it on dvd to watch at my own pace is the way I like it, and without commercials
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I read this so long ago, it's hard to remember it, I have to admit.  I do read quite a few books.  If this is the one where she goes to a women's prison, it was good and intriguing.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|one of the few television programs of recent times that I like, and I like it a lot.  having it on dvd to watch it at my pace is the way i like it, and without commercials
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Bc it apparently is not an update but a whole dif download.  I love this game but I'm not starting over. I'll try an reach out to contradict<br /><br />But the game is the best
B001DJLCRC|5.0|one of the few television programs of recent times that I like, and I like it a lot.  having it on dvd to watch it at my pace is the way i like it, and without commercials
B00AVFO41K|5.0|yes instructions would be nice and yes it is hard but there's nothing wrong with this game it actually works exactly like a game of this type is supposed to
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|I love the fact that I can just put my computer on the tv and watch a gray movie.<br />Good quality, the stream sometimes takes a little while even with good Internet speed but besides that no problem!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is one of the best I've seen in a long time. I would give it 10 stars. History,tragedy,romance,comedy,drama. I watched all 3 seasons in a three week time frame.  Really got hooked on the story line and would sometimes watch 3 episodes a night. Can't wait for season 4!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is awesome. I like it a lot and so does my poppop and meema and sister. Very nice app.
1432794426|5.0|I like this book very much. Karen Moriarty is a wonderful person and her book is well written. Thank you Karen for sharing this book with us.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Lots of excitement with a bit of a political storyline.  Watch it and see the outcome, you may like it
B008QMMEOE|5.0|This app teaches him how to drag and drop, as well as match shapes and do puzzles. He loves it
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I hated the fact that in-app purchasing pops up all the time. It is free but it is very simplistic and in order to make it more it gives the kids too many opportunities to purchase within the app.
B004UG7RQ0|1.0|Had to return it because it wouldn't play on my IPod docking speakers with my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Still haven't found anything that will work.  The return was handled completely painlessly!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This is a movie that shouod ot be missed by anyone.  My only rea comment is there shuod be moore movies like this.  Once again  a fabulous performance by Maggie Smith.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is lots of fun and the cute minions make it so much better. I would recommend this game to people of all ages.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. John Green writes like he actually a teenage girl. The story is touching and was one of the only books that ever made me cry. This book is amazing for literally anyone that likes reading. You should read this book now.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Finally caught on!  Great game.  Not sure regular solitaire will be as fulfilling!<br />Great game.  Loved the help along the way.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love the multiple alarms you can set and of course the option to choose my own music. I have had no problems with the app yet to report.
B0015RWCVM|5.0|The opening phrase of no. 29 is just a miracle: the tempo and dynamics perfectly convey the gentle playfulness. I'm immediately carried away. Just for this symphony it is worth to buy the whole set.<br /><br />Which doesn't mean the heavier ones - 38 and 41 - are not good. They're just equally excellent. Youthfulness is put alongside irony and melancholy (especially in the slow movement of 41). Ultimately the genuine joy expressed by the musicians under Abbado makes this recording another triumph.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. is great in this movie. He plays the character so well, you either love him or hate him! Overall, great movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun to play. Both my kids and I enjoy taking care of the horses.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|If you enjoy sushi this is really interesting to see all the behind the scenes what it takes to make it. Interesting perspective on passion for your job/calling in life and work ethic.
141970642X|5.0|If your kid is a Greg Heffley buff, this is a must read.  Once you start the series of books, you're hooked.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I heard a few Imagine Dragon songs on Pandora and was intrigued with this album.  Finally, I sprung for the purchase and have been thoroughly pleased.  A good variety of songs that don't sound too produced or similar.  Excellent lyrics and beats.
B00821OX98|5.0|Good premise; not the usual humans always kick butt. fighting as underdogs appeals to me. I like the use of the Boston area instead of sets to film; adds realism.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of my favorite books now. I fell in love with this book instantly#  And as Charlie says,<br /><br />\\"It was a great experience!\\"
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read many books on the subject of grief and with this book, although long, gave me hope for my son and friends who have gone to be with the LORD before me.  Beautiful imagery.
B007L7JY3Y|5.0|One of the best apps for the Kindle Fire on the Amazon store that has integration with Toodledo. Tested and certify that all this is but the most practical, aggregate with a set of tools that have not seen the other competing applications. I recommend it!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I had already seen this in person and then watched the movie and was so impressed with the voices of the actors that I had to get the soundtrack.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved the book.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.  I think I will have a great review of the 20th Century.
B008OM0EDO|2.0|Only very few funny things about it, not enough to fix stupid though. I don't see how a country could get up set about it,, unless they are tat stupid,,, oh wait....
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I will keep this book to refer to the meaning of colors of each flower - good story - well written
B008Q0AZVK|2.0|I was very surprised by this movie, I expected more outta R Pat,,, I Uma was not very Uma in this either, over acting on her part and I believe under acting on his.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have read this Dozen times but it still makes me happy. Makes me believe in love that lasts through it all. Beautiful. My only complaint. I didn't want it to end.
1118232658|5.0|It amazed me,  as I had just heard Erik speak in Orlando.  And the scary thing is how many of the issues he addressed in the book have excelled and how many sites and plans have fallen off the table.  The speed of change makes one wonder how  much faster it can occur.  We will all need brain transplants before long and of course it is just a matter of time when this will be actually possible.  I plan to read this book every couple months to remind me of the brave new world we are living and how lucky we are to be at this place and at this time!<br /><br />Hal
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Got hooked on this show late.  So I was able to catch up when cable was running a marathon and it was great to have Season 3 on Instant Video to totally catch up.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my kid loves it she wants a real horse but I say I cant buy you one and she started playing. this game and she didn't wants a horse anymore
B000AYEL1A|4.0|I've watched several versions of a Star is Born.  The first version I saw had Judy Garland playing the lead.  I really loved this version with Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson.  The new music was great!  This was a great movie.
0763657875|3.0|I'm not sure why I'm the only reviewer who is not at all impressed by this pop-up book. The pop-ups are average at best, very simple and unimaginative. When I think of what some pop-up artists could have done with the treasure that London is, it is even more disappointing. The book is informative, but better pop-ups would have brought info that can be found in book after book to life.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I loved Dead Snow, so buying this movie was an easy choice for me.  (I was also happy to learn that they are working on a sequel to Hansel & Gretel.  I look forward to that with great anticipation.)<br />I bought this version of the film because I'm a sucker for a label that dares to suggest `intense new footage NOT seen in theaters.'  I'm not a timid soul, if you've got an uncensored version of anything I want to see it.<br /><br />Love steampunk, loved the fanciful weaponry used throughout.  Loved that a lot of the action takes place in the wilderness (their interior fight sequences were less successful due to poor lighting).  Loved that the movie was both grim and humorous (it needed to work a lot harder to be dead on funny though).  As for the acting, of the lot Famke Janssen served the movie best as Muriel a witch with a diabolical plan.  Gemma Arterton was also fantastic as Gretel.  Less successful was Jeremy Renner as Hansel, he seemed terribly uncomfortable trying to exist in this wacky world of witches.  Concerning the claim of inconsistent action, yes, a lot of the fighting sequences were straight out of the Looney Tunes handbook of silly, but so what.  Realism was not their aim!  And yes, the story is a bit simplistic; but this is not the type of movie that requires complications to hold our interest.  There is no earth shattering reveal, no twist, nothing surprising or unexpected, it's pretty straight forward.  The plot concerns the siblings Hansel & Gretel who have issues that will never be resolved as long as there are witches to hunt down and exterminate.  They are bounty hunters.  They get paid to do one thing.  That's what this movie is all about.  I don't know how that confused some critics, but it obviously did.<br /><br />For me, the only questionable scene (that was added afterwards) involves an attempted gang rape.  How that got tossed into the mix is anyone's guess, especially as it serves no purpose other than to confuse the intent of the the filmmakers.  It literally came out of left field.<br />Other than that, I have no additional complaints.  It's a keeper!filmmakers.  It literally came out of left field.<br />Other than that, I have no additional complaints.  It's a keeper!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|and for quite a small price considering what we used to pay for each movie. I began with Star Trek, the Motion Picture, watching each during my 90-minute sessions on an air circulation machine for my legs. I have lymphedema in both so I need twice-daily treatments. What better way to spend them than watching the Enterprise crew in action. I suppose my favorite is the last one in the package as it is always hilarious to watch and listen to McCoy with his binoculars trained on his captain trying to scale El Capitan. When he, Kirk and Spock are on the ground at the campfire, Kirk and Bones introduce Spock to Row, Row, Row Your Boat. Meanwhile, Bones is cooking up his special beans which means he adds Bourbon to it and serves it to Spock who says it is quite good. The bulk of the movie is a lot more serious, but in the end we are back at the same campground and Spock picks out a tune on his Vulcan instrument, and what should he play but Row, Row, Row Your Boat. Nothing like hamming it up on the final Star Trek movie Nimoy was in.
034580404X|4.0|I didn't pour thru the pages like others may have, as I have enjoyed erotica for many years, but I found the trilogy a good read.
B000FC2JTS|3.0|This is my second read of this book. This time I am two years older and getting to know someone that I went to high school with over forty years ago.  I read this book again to determine if I was doing the correct thing by not calling this man. This book has some great information in it but it also is very depressing. Wish I had it to read about twenty years ago.

B001P3SA94|5.0|Director Darnell Martin loves interesting camera angles and &#34;true&#34; performances from her Actors.  I watched her pull an amazing true-to-life scene out of young MacKenzie Foy in the upcoming &#34;Wish You Well&#34; so you can imagine what she gets out of Adrien Brody.  Darnell is a passionate consummate film-making perfectionist so even her &#34;older&#34; works are still better than 99% of everyone else's &#34;latest&#34; ones.  Must be why she's been asked to Direct over 15 &#34;Law and Order&#34; episodes.  Add &#34;Cadillac Records&#34; to your &#34;must-have&#34; movie collection.

B0095VP8D4|5.0|TL:DR: This chip performs well, you can overclock it modestly, and you can game on it. It's not the new A10-6800, but that's OK. Buy it if you're looking for mainstream gaming and don't have a real upgrade future with this chip.<br /><br />What I Like: I use this chip in a super-modest media and gaming PC (read: Steam Box and Multi-Console Emulation) with no discrete GPU. As far as playing mainstream games at mainstream settings, this chip is solid. I took this chip's iGPU from stock 800mhz to 900mhz with no voltage increase. That's not the world's most aggressive overclock, but it does make a difference. I've played Sleeping Dogs, Skyrim, GRID, and the Dolphin (Gamecube and Wii) Emulator with it and the results were pretty good. Without posting any benchmarks, all above played @1080p resolution at very playable framerates with mainstream detail options dialed in.<br /><br />I'd be happy to share some benchmarks if anyone's interested... But I will say from memory, games that are 90-100% emulated properly in Dolphin ran at 60fps+ @ 1080p: an improvement over Gamecube/Wii hardware. Emulating lesser hardware (NES, SNES, Sega Master System/Genesis/32X, MAME) was flawless. I have yet to try PS2 gaming on it, but I'd expect that it could.<br /><br />So for my application, this thing is pretty awesome<br /><br />What I don't like about it: It just kind of sucks that 6 months into ownership, AMD comes out with a more refined version of this chip: The A10-6800K. But honestly, if you want to save yourself $20 or $30 this chip isn't THAT much worse than the 6800. With proper cooling and a little overclocking, you can get this chip to match Richland's GPU performance. The 300mhz CPU defecit under Richland really doesn't make that much difference... which is kind of a sad commentary on CPU performance as a whole. Also from the gaming perspective, another underwhelming aspect is the Hybrid Crossfire options the iGPU has with discrete GPUs. If you're going that route, the best card you can pair with this is a 6670. And that's OK... I guess. But it would have been nicer if you could pair the card with a newer dGPU from the 77X0 line. Also, if you do put a more powerful dGPU in the system it automatically disables the iGPU. I believe that AMD really dropped the ball on what could have been a huge power saving opportunity, especially if you're using an AMD video card especially when the tech exists in the laptop versions of this chip. But that's a rant for a tech blog somewhere else. But if you want to &#34;start small and build up&#34;... you may want to go with an Intel platform (Ivy Bridge or Haswell) because those sockets (socket 1155 and 1150) have a lot more chip options, better CPU performance overall, and make more sense if you're planning on buying that $300 to $600 video card later.<br /><br />Overall: This chip is a good choice for a value gaming/TV PC where you don't plan on upgrading too far past what you have. You can do most games @ 1080p with some @720p with good results. And if you want more GPU power you can drop in a ~$70 card and get improved results (especially since AMD is about 1 month away from fixing their Crossfire issues). Plus if you're NOT using this for gaming, you'll still get plenty of value for the price, although you may want to consider the A8-5600k for cheaper. But as whole, I'm very pleased with mine after 7 months of ownership.rd you can pair with this is a 6670. And that's OK... I guess.

I'm hooked!<br />There is a little something for everyone in this album. Typical FiR Hard Rock, some rap, and even a folky type song too. I dont know if anything will every touch &#34;The Drug In Me Is You&#34; album, but this one is one for the books.

B000ZHS3E8|4.0|Its a pretty good movie.  Everyone else here has already listed the plot and whatnot, so I will just say that it is enjoyable and not a waste of money.<br /><br />The only thing that I would say I am sad about is that NOT ONCE during the movie did someone say \\"It Looks Like It's Daylight Savings Time!\\".  That would have been awesome.
0143039431|5.0|The final installment in John Steinbeck's informal \\"Dust Bowl Trilogy\\" along with In Dubious Battle and Of Mice and Men, The Grapes of Wrath is a work that clearly has to be in the discussion if we're talking about the greatest American novel. I don't think it quite gets there, for a number of reasons addressed below, but that's not to take away from the achievement.<br /><br />Steinbeck's epic of the Joads--clearly everyman figures created to represent much more than themselves--stuns with its epic scope, overweening ambition and dramatic power. The book is nowhere better than in the scenes showing the Joads dealing with each other and with the outside forces they don't understand. We feel the desperation, cringe at the naivet&eacute; and admire the pluck and determination as they make their way from their appropriated traditional homestead to a hopefully better life in California.<br /><br />Each family member comes alive as a distinct personality in Steinbeck's beautifully detailed narrative, even the little kids Winfield and Ruthie. I loved the descriptions of their behaviors. That's just how little kids are. This is supported by Steinbeck's incredible eye for detail and master stylist's ability to convey it vividly, whether it's how to repair a crankshaft in a '26 Dodge or how to gut and roast a rabbit over an open fire. He clearly knew what he was talking about.<br /><br />The one character I think fails to work is Jim Casy, who is clearly the author's alter ego as well as being the most obvious Christ figure in the history of literature. Steinbeck strains to put his philosophy into Casy's mouth in a kind of elevated hillbilly-speak that works less often than you would like. At different points, this task is also taken up by Tom Joad and by Ma, with mixed results.<br /><br />The novel is also often celebrated for its approach of alternating short broad-perspective chapters that at their best work as virtual poems, with the longer narrative chapters that bring us back to the particular with the story of the Joads' adventures. It reinforces the universality of the Joads and puts them in perspective among the larger historical, economic and cultural forces at work.<br /><br />The one major flaw I found in this book is the way Steinbeck wears his sympathies on his sleeve and lets it affect his art. While he purports to push a no-fault philosophy that says in the words of Casy \\"maybe there's no right and no wrong, there's just stuff folks do,\\" that's clearly not the case. In fact, this is one of the most Manichean books ever written. In reality, the stuff folks do that is neither right nor wrong only applies to stuff folks do that Steinbeck approves of. When that stuff extends to calling in bank loans, pricing products to market or leveraging economies of scale, there definitely is right and wrong and Steinbeck makes no bones about it.<br /><br />There is also a pettiness in Steinbeck calling out businessmen, farmers and cops for stereotyping the \\"Okies\\" and then stereotyping those same businessmen, farmers and cops mercilessly himself (you can always tell which characters Steinbeck disapproves of because there's no subtlety to their mustache-twirling evil). Clearly, Steinbeck was if not a socialist then certainly a man of the left at this point, perhaps understandably so because there's no doubt the Dust Bowl migrants were often cruelly taken advantage of, but those opinions get in the way of the art at times. The government camp, for example, is romanticized beyond credibility.<br /><br />Steinbeck got Grapes in just under the wire as the 1930s were ending and the cultural/political landscape he depicted changed with the U.S. entry into World War II. Hence, the revolution he predicts several times in the book never happened and The Grapes of Wrath becomes a kind of amber-encrusted cultural artifact despite its universalist ambitions. Well, even so it remains a powerful document that is a testament to the human spirit and amust-read on any tour of American literature.ead on any tour of American literature.

1781162646|4.0|I am an avid King fan and &#34;Cujo,&#34; and &#34;Misery&#34; scared me much more than his supernatural novels and short stories. But King is a consumate story teller and that's is what is captivating in &#34;Joyland&#34; - you get pulled into these seemingly everyday people's lives and discover that they aren't really so everyday for at least one moment in their lives.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to love this app. It was pretty accurate,  the maps were updated a lot, and it was easy to navigate. Here lately; however, the maps were getting more and more behind: last week my area had a pop-up storm with quarter-sized hail and the map was over 90 minutes behind. By the time the radar had been updated the storm was 2 counties to the east. Then a couple days ago I was cursed with an automatic update, leaving me with a shell of my old app. I can't navigate it for beans, it looks so cartoony and is badly disorganized. If you update an app, try and make it somewhat like the old version, so people like me won't remove and get another app.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|I chose a four due to the nature of a child droning on about things that in normal life a parent would say alright already. I get the situation of confinement and I applaud the writers way of having mom turn an act of rape into a positive by having Jack be her light in a dark situation. It's upsetting that the mom after all they went through decided she can't go on ,and being selfish took the easy way out. Leaving Jack to find her. It's sad.<br />  I would recommend this book because through jacks eyes room was perfect ,safe,and that's all he needed . We take so much for granted that we don't really appreciate what we have until it's gone like ma.

B00B2166BS|1.0|I dislike writing bad reviews. If I don't like a product, I just tend to not write anything. BUT, this is so bad I feel a warning is in order.<br /><br />I &#34;trouble shooted&#34; this cable with different connections.  To my computer, using the power plug that came with my Nexus. (recommended way) And then a couple of other USB power supplies.<br /><br />I had hoped to use this as a way to continue to power my tablet while using it at a desk.  But, it doesn't provide enough power to the tablet.  In fact, if you have any background apps running, it simply doesn't charge at all.  They advertise as charging faster than the micro-USB port on the Nexus.  It is the opposite.<br /><br />The only way I could get the Pogo to charge my Nexus at all was to turn the tablet off entirely and then it slowly charged.<br /><br />I was busy after buying it and didn't realize how horrible a product this was until after the cut off for returning it.  Or it would have been returned.<br /><br />Do NOT buy this cable.  It is expensive and as it turns out, a $4 micro-USB cable is more reliable and fast.<br /><br />Amazon should consider dropping this company and their seriously flawed cable.

0756405890|5.0|See the official review: [...]<br /><br /> Oh my, where to begin...  Honestly, there's this part of me that wishes I hadn't found this book until late next year because then, the third and final book in the series might actually be out as well!  I just finished the second book in the series this week, and am quite possibly going to die of impatience since the third one won't be released until sometime in 2014.<br /><br />I absolutely love the story that Rothfuss has created in the first book of the Kingkiller Chronicles - in my personal opinion, The Name of the Wind is one of the absolute best fantasy novels I have read in a very long time...and fantasy is one of my favorite genres.<br /><br />Okay, enough rambling on how much I love the book for now, and onto particulars.  Kvothe, the main character, comes across as a real person throughout the novel.  He has strengths, weaknesses, and some serious flaws that get him into trouble - and all of these keep him from becoming one of the cliched heroes that just seems too perfect.  The people he meets throughout the book make perfect sense in his life, whether they are antagonistic towards him, such as Ambrose, or Denna, who keeps him guessing.  Personally, I think that Devi may be one of my favorite characters, I prefer her to Denna actually.  I love the interaction between the characters, and how each decision Kvothe makes only builds his reputation.  Personally, I don't like Bast...he gave me some seriously bad vibes throughout the whole book, but he makes sense as someone who misses the man that Kvothe used to be.<br /><br />The way that the story is told in the hero's voice to the Chronicler, many years after all of these events have transpired only makes the tale that much more interesting.  Throughout his life, many stories have been told about Kvothe, and the story he tells includes everything that he sees as important in his life - with no embelllishment, making them seem so much more realistic than the tales that others have told.  For instance, learning the truth of why Kvothe was called \\"The Bloodless\\" shows how the stories became larger than life compared to the actual events.<br /><br />Rothfuss has truly created an incredible world, characters, and storyline with the debut novel of The Kingkiller Chronicle.  In a lot of novels, there's something that just doesn't fit in or make sense - and that's just not the case with The Name of the Wind which only increased the overall appeal of the work.  I can't really think of any negatives in the book personally, because if the parts and characters that I didn't like weren't in the story, it wouldn't have been as wonderful overall.at others have told.

The thin film on the cover is already starting to peel.  The part that is used to prop it up (for hands free reading) sometimes collapses.  Also, it props it up horizontally, but now that I'm using it, I realize that I would sometimes prefer to have it stand vertically.  (Especially for reading)

B004K8WPUQ|4.0|I got this mic because there was so much talk about the internal zoom making nose on canon lenses.  Some people said it ruined the video because every time the focus shifted, you'd hear it loudly.  Although I have the STM lens that is supposed to fix this problem, if the room is quiet enough... you may hear it quietly from time to time.  With this mic, it is not a problem at all.  All the sound comes through crisp and clear, and the on board dB boost helps pick up where the internal mic leaves off.  Two things to note:  First, the mic is mono!  So if you care about the 'stereo' recording capability of the native mic... you will lose that with this mic.  Second, the chord and mounting system are VERY flimsy.  You will HAVE to use care when mounting and dismounting this mic, and be gentle with the input wire.

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I've read a lot of other reviews and people (the ones who aren't whining about the drummer) are praising this album, saying it could have easily been released in 1972. That being said, it does have the classic Sabbath sound to it. However, at times I think it sounds too much like the classics. Some of the songs sound like updated versions of songs they already did. \\"Loner,\\" for example, sounds and is organized strikingly similar to \\"N.I.B.\\" The guitar riff immediately reminds you of \\"N.I.B.\\" and the breakdown is taken directly from it. \\"End of the Beginning\\" is arranged exactly like the first song \\"Black Sabbath\\" was in 1970. It starts with the powerful, evil intro, followed by the quiet, moaning vocals from Ozzy, and eventually leading to a faster section further in. I'm not saying the album is awful. In fact, none of it is, it's a great album. Actually, \\"Loner\\" happens to be one of my favorite songs from it, as well as \\"Dear Father.\\" I'm simply saying that I feel they tried too hard to reconnect to the \\"Satan-worshiping\\" image and sound they had 40 years ago.
0451209338|3.0|I've been meaning to read this for some time.  One of my friends was enthusiastic about the series and I decided to give it a go.  Gabriel Alon is a former Mossad agent who is asked to come out of retirement in order to eliminate a Palestinian terrorist who is attempting to destroy the Olso peace process.  Alon recruits a beautiful model who has worked for him in the past.  One of the cool things about Alon is that he also works as an art restorer and the contrast between this work and being an assassin makes for a nice twist.  The plot was pretty standard but it did keep my interest.  I enjoyed it, but I've certainly read better spy/assassin novels.  I have lived in Israel for the last forty years and so little of what Silva wrote about these agents was new or especially intriguing.  I may try another book in the series hoping that the novels get better as the author hones his craft.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really challenge your skills. Very addicting and relaxing.good way to relax your mind before bed. I love it.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|While I had hoped for a different ending, this was an unexpected beauty of a read and in hindsight, the ending could not have been any other way.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|only 10 levels with promises for more very fun though can not go wrong when the game is free looking forward to more
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I was amazed that the show goes pretty much straight from the book. I don't usually see that, but it's still a great read.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Excellent movie.  This dude thought he could be a coke addict alcoholic and still be an amazing airline pilot.  luckiily he used to fly cropdusters as a kid.  Only problem is I don't think he wouldve really been able to fly the jet upside down to become the hero the movie portrayed.  However, he did show he had a soul when in the end he confessed and paid the price of having lost the lives of several people in the crash, including his hussy girlfriend.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the books after the first movie. I enjoyed the movie, however at the end of these books. Katness has just gotten on my nerves, hopefully they change that in the movies.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|It sucks.  It doesn't work well . I downloaded it and it doesn't work with my downloaded pdf documents.  It wont jump in and read them.  It does work on my laptop (regular reader) and tower computer but my mobiles it just is a pain.  I want to be able to read a lot of informative downloads but can't.  Files can't be opened or read.
B009NY43NY|5.0|If you love the show you will fall in love all over again while reading the books, It's a not miss.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series! It keeps you riveted with great story lines and acting. The characters are well developed and you really want to follow what happens. I can't wait for Season 4.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good ending. I am glad that Katniss stayed with Peeta, but primrose, her sister, death was unnecessary after Katniss fought so hard against the capitol.
B00DD49R0E|4.0|The movie was fun but the sound track is great... Because I'm Happy and feel like happiness is the truth. [...]<br />This movie will be in our collection it just wasn't as good as the first one. Happy Happy Happy... don't bring me down. Clap along!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It's fun and challenging without becoming frustrating, great graphics, too.  Looking forward to even more rooms!
B000W93CHC|4.0|I first read Fall of Giants, and couldn't wait to read the sequel. Then I read Pillars of the earth, and again loved it. Went right into World without End, and wish it wasn't done. I've become a real Ken Follett fan.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I'm only sad because of the wait for the next book, A Dance with Dragons kick it's predecessor arse. It's my favorite book out of the ASOFAI series, so far. It wasn't too long and there was always something to keep me turning pages.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Great show, but a little too melodramatic this season.  Killing off two main characters is making this show like Survivor.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I bought this and instantly . Loved it its got good  graphics for a kindle fire and fun game play multiplayer is slightly annoying though but that's not a big deal.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It's hard not to love the Crossfire novels. Sylvia Day does an excellent job. Thank goodness there is going to bed another book! I have so many questions still!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Hey it's a great time killer. Want to waste an hour or two this is a game to fulfil that need
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|my kids and I loved this game at first.  it's super cute and tons of fun to play, but now what is happening to us I see has happened to others - the game won't open.  quite disappointing since we've only had it a few days and the kids want to play.  would give 5 stars if we could actually play again.
030788743X|4.0|This is the outright geekiest book I've read in a long, long time. In fact, if you were born around 1970 and grew up a pop culture junkie in the `80s, this is absolutely the book for you. Hey, I'm a generation older than that and I still loved it. Here's the set-up: It's 2044 and the U.S. is basically falling apart. Only the wealthy can afford gas-powered cars, corporations can force debtors into lifelong indenture-slavery, and you can buy a gun from a vending machine. Millions of small-towners have moved into the cities so they can get to work -- those few who have jobs, anyway -- and many of them live in trailers stacked twenty-high on the dangerous outskirts of town. It's a world any sane person would want to escape from.<br /><br />Fortunately, there's the OASIS, which has virtually (in all senses of the word) replaced the Internet. Designed and established originally as a groundbreaking Massive Multi-User game, it has now become the alternative \\"real world\\" for much of the world's population. Everyone who can works there, plays there, learns to read there, goes to college there, carries on business there, and spends every moment they can on its tens of thousands of exquisitely rendered planets, many of them with pop-culture themes. All this is made possible by very advanced haptic rigs that vary from cheap visor-gloves combos to bodysuits and gimbaled control chairs, depending on what you can afford. James Halliday, genius inventor, designer, and almost-sole owner of the OASIS, is now worth $130 billion. And then he dies.<br /><br />A gamer of genius all his life, Halliday has set up a contest in his will whereby whoever can open three Gates with three Keys, leading to the discovery of the ultimate Easter Egg, will inherit everything. Thus is born the life of the egg-hunter -- \\"gunter\\" -- who sinks every waking moment in the quest. Wade Watts, at eighteen, is the quintessential gunter and nearly six years after Halliday's death, he's still looking for the breakthrough clue to the first gate. There's not a video or computer game, geek-movie, rock group or tune, or any other detail of `80s culture that he doesn't know because any bit of it might be the key to the first Key. He has a number of friends online but none in the so-called real world and, it goes without saying, zero experience with girls. And then he gets a lucky break -- and suddenly the race is on. But he'll have to be careful because there's a mega-corporation called IOI that believes the OASIS hasn't been properly managed to produce a big enough profit. They plan to remedy that by completing the quest themselves and taking control of things. And considering how much is at stake, they're not too picky about how they accomplish their goal.<br /><br />I've never thought of myself as a game-player -- except that I spent several years in the late `70s playing D & D every weekend. And when I got my first home computer, a TRS-80, in 1980, I also became addicted for awhile to text-type games, especially ADVENTURE and ZORK. (You could do a surprising amount with Line-Numbered BASIC and a handful of pixels, all of it backed-up to a 5.25-inch floppy.) My own pop-culture references date from the 1960s and `70s, but my kids were growing up in the `80s, so I was aware of their world, too. Well, Cline knows it all, tossing out descriptions and playing strategies of games, and giant robots, and Saturday morning animation shows, and third-tier rock groups on every page. It's an epic quest tale in a strongly cinematic style. If you're in your forties, there's a good chance you'll love this book. Most of the less-than-stellar reviews I've seen have mostly criticized the author for arcane errors -- which only tells me the reviewer is even geekier than the author. Don't worry about that. And don't worry about the fact that the author sometimes seems to be trying to produce a Young Adult novel for middle-aged readers. This isn't meant to be Great Literature. it's meant to be fun,and in that it certainly succeeds. Just read the first couple of chapters on faith. I guarantee you'll be hooked.and in that it certainly succeeds. Just read the first couple of chapters on faith. I guarantee you'll be hooked.
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|Can't play the game because I can't get flash player on my kindle fire HD.  Would like to know when it will be available.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I am still reading it.  It has not grabbed and held me, but I will give it another shot this fall when I don't get outside as much as I do when the weather is grand.
B001KQIOP6|5.0|the ture work of an artist at the top of his game... great tracks of anger, with  Bomb First, & Against All Odds, political tracks such as... White Man'z World, religious tracks, Blasphemy an athem track with, To Live And Die In L.A. and of course a party song with Toss It Up. tupac was beyond his time.
B004JK61K0|4.0|I couldn't get my Kindle Fire to work with my Verizon e-mail; I was bounced back & forth between Kindle and Verizon support/help lines; neither could get it to work.  I finally got a hold of someone from Kindle support who suggested I download K-9 Mail to see if it could download my in my Verizon, and it worked.  Although K-9 mail has limited capacity, it does work.
B003B02O7I|5.0|My first book purchased for my kindle.  Could not put it down. Very intriguing and different for a John Grisham book.
1400095204|4.0|I like the book Half of a Yellow Sun because I could relate to the environment as I have had multiple travels to Africa.  I have not been to Nigeria due to domestic unrest and I was told by Nigerians living in the US not to go there alone.  The characters are seen throughout Africa and other countries.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Great game for the money, $3 well spent. The game is deep and immersive with a lot of extra content and functionality over the RPG free version.<br />Some players may be put off by the lack of an overall story arc to lead them through the game, but I am enjoying the totally open game play. You can truly craft your own destiny and the award unlock system gives you some targets to play for that will lead you to different play styles and difficulty levels.<br />the difficulty levels are truly difficult as well. You should be prepared to be truly challenged by the higher levels.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|This story is hot and I love their growing love for each other. Christian grey is one hot character. :)

B009EJSUBY|4.0|I purchased this set because I was looking for a comprehensive collection of classical piano music, and Van Cliburn is one of the masters.  Some of the discs have a playing time that is shorter than what we've come to expect on a CD, but you should remember that these are CDs made from the original vinyl recordings that Cliburn made for RCA throughout his career.  All in all, this is a special and varied collection of music, and you certainly cannot go wrong for the price.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I appreciate that the battery life shows at the top of the Kindle regardless of what program you're using.<br />It easily lets you know what the status of your battery is.

B008JFUR10|2.0|Every summer, without fail, there is an epic adventure flick with high ambitions of being the \\"next big thing,\\" produced with a towering budget, and looking to cash-in on the box office frenzy that runs wild between the months of May and September.  In previous summers, some of the poorly executed, yet commercially successful films like Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Battleship, and Battle: Los Angeles, have managed to create an advertising blitz that brought people to the theaters, only to leave them with a bad taste in their mouths.  Earlier this summer, After Earth tried to cash-in with the off-world futuristic \\"epic,\\" only to fall flat on its face critically and commercially.  With that being said, it's only natural to see the endless advertisements for Pacific Rim and wonder what it's all about, creating an interest for movie-goers to go check it out.  Is it destined to be the next summer blockbuster, or will the film have audiences begging for ticket refunds by the time the credits roll?<br /><br />Director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth, Blade II) helms the sci-fi disaster flick, set in the 2020s on planet earth.  For years, gigantic creatures, called \\"Kaiju,\\" have been rising from the ocean, with little resistance to stop them from devastating earth's cities.  However, humanity has put aside their differences and decided to fight back - building giant robot war machines, called \\"Jaegers\\" to deal with the rising threat of the massive creatures.  Charlie Hunnam stars as Raleigh Becket, a former robot pilot re-called to action by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps, commanded by Stacker Penecost (Idris Elba).  However, before Becket can return to the front-lines, he must first \\"calibrate\\" with his new rookie co-pilot, Marko Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, Robert Kazinsky, and Ron Perlman also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />For the \\"fanboy kingdom\\" out there, Pacific Rim will most likely be their new baby that they will defend to the bitter end - for reasons beyond comprehension.  However, it's the closest thing to authentic Godzilla-like action that anyone has seen in quite a while.  But, as someone that has never been into Godzilla or anything resembling it, I'll be the first to admit that a film like this is out of my element and beyond my typical safety zone.  With that being said, here we go...<br /><br />Over the course of watching this film, the only thing that really stood out was the fact that countless other movies and television shows reminded me of it.  If you grew up in the 1990s, you most likely recall Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (yeah, I'm goin' there).  Every single time these gigantic robots, \\"Jaegars (which instantly make me think about doing shots for some reason)\\" would assemble together (prior to going into battle), I couldn't stop thinking about that highly annoying \\"Go! Go! Power Rangers!\\" theme music.  And, what made it even worse was when the robot started fighting with a giant sword (just like the Power Ranger's Megazord).  I'm not going to lie, these giant sea monsters are battling massive Godzilla-looking monsters for the fate of mankind and all I kept thinking was \\"wow, this movie could really use the Pink Ranger right about now.\\"  Not only did these robots remind me of the zords from the Power Rangers (and Optimus Prime), but their pilots are wearing borderline storm trooper attire.  It's like writer Travis Beacham had just finished watching the Power Rangers boxed set, followed by the Transformers trilogy, and then finished his viewing extravaganza with Real Steel, Battleship and Independence Day (because I couldn't help but notice how Idris Elba's \\"touching\\" climactic speech paralleled Bill Pullman in ID4).<br /><br />As long as I'm going to make a Star Wars reference, I might as well comment on how impressive the heavy use of CGI was over the course of this film.  Naturally, Industrial Light and Magic were responsible for the visual effects, so that would explain the correlation to Star Wars (at least in the prequel trilogy).  There is never a point in this film where the robots don't look hip or authentic enough to do their job.  These bots (and there are a variety of them) each feature their own system of weapons, with some being much cooler than others.  There's really no comparison: watching these robots flash some sweet, explosive weaponry always trumps watching them try to beat a monster to death with a pair of steel fists.  And, while the bots are pretty eye-catching, the monsters (Kaiju) were creatively effective in their own right.  Hopefully, Gareth Edwards (directing the upcoming American reboot of Gozilla) has taken note on how to make Gozilla look like a total bad-ass for next year's release.<br /><br />While it's true, the CGI is extremely commendable on this film, it doesn't negate the fact that Pacific Rim is just another film with an excuse to constantly destroy city buildings and cause random mayhem.  In fact, you can probably set your watch that buildings will be destroyed every ten minutes or so.  One of the biggest beef about Man of Steel was the fact that it spends too much time on destruction and not enough time on plot substance - which is also the main complaint here.  Pacific Rim isn't a character driven film and obviously it wasn't meant to be since it severely lacks Hollywood star power, but something tells me characters are not the big \\"draw\\" for this film.  Although, on a side note - it is amusing how the whole plot appears to be based around the premise that global warming is essentially to blame for the earth's predicament.<br /><br />Will Pacific Rim meet its quota for the summer (meaning hit its budget and earn some of that fat Hollywood movie cash)?  With a budget in the $200 million ballpark, it's going to be pretty difficult.  After Earth already failed earlier this year and that flick had Will Smith starring in it.  But, if terrible films, like Battleship and Battle: Los Angeles can do it - then Pacific Rim has a shot to be a successful future franchise.  However, at the end of the day, Pacific Rim is going to cater only to those interested in sci-fi action and sci-fi related genres.  There's absolutely nothing in this film that stands up and says, \\"check out this fresh new idea.\\"  It's just one more lengthy battle flick that shows the earth on the end of its ropes, which is a tiresome tale that can easily cause the average movie-goer to get bored.  However, for the sci-fi lovers out there - Pacific Rim is mostly likely your new favorite movie of the summer.  It features beautiful CGI, a slew of action, and endless possibilities for future films.  In other words, the nerds will be out in force, having a ball, while everyone looks for something better to watch.<br /><br />GRADE:  D+<br />FNDNreview.complain the correlation to Star Wars (at least in the prequel trilogy).

B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Do not waste your time on this piece of garbage.  It was the worst movie I've seen this year.  JUST PLAIN TERRIBLE.
1401324649|4.0|Now here's a funny read.  I really enjoyed the &#34;dual&#34; stories going on in this book.  The current time and the reflection of his past life were wonderfully put together and its great how so many things come back around.  Great fun.  Do yourself a favor and read it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the continuing story of Eva and Gideon!  I was, however, disappointed when the story just ended so abruptly; I thought this was the last book in the series so I expected the story to come to a conclusion.  So I was very disappointed when I found myself on the last page only to find out I will have to wait for the next installment to come out.

145210655X|1.0|I think a lot depends on what are you expecting when you buy this book.<br /><br />My kids and I love star wars, and I thought it would be a nice story book to read together say at bedtime. No way. First this is not a story book. This is simply a collection of somewhat funny 1 page cartoons (for a lack of better word). Second the humor in general is an adult sort of humor - which a 4-10 year old wouldn't find funny at all. You have to be a parent (or at least an adult) to see the humor in that situation. But I didn't buy this book to sit by myself and read.<br /><br />I had also bought the daughter version (princess). The same comment applies to that one. Overall both of these have been a dud in my family.

B0090SI4LU|1.0|We watched this movie and started laughing at how bad it was.  I never read the book so I didn't know what to expect, but boy o' boy, this movie was so bad and extremely cheesy (the comments the girl was making to herself were laugh-out-loud ridiculous).  Looking at the reviews it seems a lot of people like it, so I might be missing something.  Anyway, I honestly think it was the worst movie I have ever seen.  Give it a shot though, it just wasn't for me.

I told my son I am taking this from his Kindle and look for a better dragon game since he loves dragons.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|\\"It's been an honor to pay tribute to one of my greatest musical influences. As producers, the expertise of both John Burk and Randy Waldman were maximized in these recordings. And the engineering genius of Al Schmitt along with Seth Presant helped to make this project amongst my best musical efforts.\\" ~ George Benson ~<br /><br />Honoring the greatness of Nat King Cole via a tribute album was one of George Benson's dreams and he was so grateful to those involved in this project in helping him fulfill such a dream.<br /><br />I can predict another Grammy-winning-album for the ten-time Grammy-winning-guitarist/singer. Why?<br /><br />Firstly, this project is a loving and heartfelt tribute to Nat King Cole who was one of George Benson's greatest musical inspirations and influences. His admiration to the artistry of Nat King Cole stemmed at an early age of eight as evidenced on track one where you could hear the young Georgie singing \\"Mona Lisa\\" and accompanying himself on the ukelele. If you pay close attention to his singing, Nat King Cole's influence is very discernable on young Georgie's  vocal styling. There's nothing like honoring a musical legend who was one of the very best singers in the world and George Benson's own interpretations on the entire album are superlative and justifiable to the everlasting music of Nat King Cole.<br /><br />Secondly, the material is well-chosen from his impressive body of work. These are the very same songs that were mostly identified with Nat King Cole who recorded the definitive version of each song,  popularized them, stamped his signature, and made these songs his very own. With George Benson's fresh renditions, each track becomes more memorable and unforgettable.<br /><br />Thirdly, Nelson Riddle's brilliant arrangements were used in six tracks: \\"Just One Of Those Things,\\" \\"Nature Boy,\\" \\"Ballerina,\\" \\"Too Young,\\" \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter\\" and \\"Mona Lisa.\\"<br /><br />Another very good reason to be ecstatic about this lovely album is Randy Waldman's superb arrangements most especially my top favorite from this set, \\"Unforgettable,\\" which highlights the stunning trumpet solo of one of the finest musicians, multi-Grammy-awardee Wynton Marsalis. George Benson's rendition is simply superb. It is a wow-moment for me. I froze it to this track and listened  for what seemed like forever. Although I have loved Nat King Cole's ultimate and definitive interpretation for the longest time, this is my new favorite version and Randy Waldman is my new favorite arranger. I have included him in my book of Who's Who in jazz as one of the greatest arrangers of our time. The Grammy-award-winning-arranger is also the pianist for the entire album and you could hear his background vocals on \\"Straighten Up And Fly Right.\\" His chart arrangements on the remaining tracks not arranged by Nelson Riddle are all remarkably beautiful including two bonus tracks, \\"That Sunday, That Summer\\" and \\"Ramblin' Rose.\\" I can hear some Nelson Riddle, Billy May, Claus Ogerman influences on his arrangements.<br /><br />One more momentous  reason to love this album is the presence of some of the finest and time-tested musicians such as Chuck Berghofer (bass), Gregg Field (drums), Tim May (guitar), Michael O'Neill (baritone guitar/banjo), Michael Fisher and Sheila E. (percussion), Janey Clewer, Alvin Chea, Don Chelton, Chris Papasthepanou (background vocals), guest singers Idina Menzel (\\"When I Fall In Love\\"), Till Bronner (\\"Smile\\"), Judith Hill (\\"Too Young\\") and the 42-piece Henry Mancini Institute Orchestra.<br /><br />Finally, this recording is summed up as an embarassment of riches in terms of overflow of musical treasures, wealth of musicianship, excellent material, impeccable interpretations with exquisite arrangements and flawless engineering. It is truly one of his \\"best musical efforts.\\" Each track is a memorable musical moment. The disc, in its entirety, has too much of a good thing...and that makes it wonderful! Needless to say, this is a precious gem of an album.<br /><br />\\"Too much of a good thing is wonderful.\\" ~ Mae West ~t wonderful!

043599445X|5.0|My teacher just ordered this book at the end of our Junior year to replace the crappy textbook that the school originally provided, which was great for the AP kids it was bought for, but had to constantly be supplemented with extra info for the IB curriculum. We picked it up during the summer, and just having done our summer assignment with it, I love it! It has the assessment statements and is divided by topic/option and assessment statement group, which is really great for reviewing, especially since our teacher uses the IB question bank for all tests! I'll comment at the end of this year with my grade for the course, but this book is already really beneficial!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|LOVE IT, who in their right mind would not love this movie!! hottie i want all of the movies oaky
B009EHDU7U|5.0|An entertaining and engaging work of whimsy. Recommended if you want a laugh and a pleasant read.  Funny and clever with modern historical links throughout that have you racing for the next punch line.  Shades of Kurt Vonnegut with tongue firmly in cheek, and I'd love to have a vodka with Allan Karlsson...but happy to read about his band of misfits.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Good fun movie for the whole family. The animation is great and the story interesting. Can't wait to see number 2.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I loved it and I think that everyone should get this game! You can change the background and the backs of the cards,so get this game!!!!
B0087ITBT8|5.0|Finally a movie that has a sweet, simple heart. It's not slapstick, it's not vulgar, it doesn't pretend to change the world. It's just pure entertainment with the incomparable Ms. Streisand proving that she hasn't lost a bit of her magic and her ability to communicate with her eyes (watch the scene when she learns the name of her lost  love's daughter). I laughed, I was moved. The movie left me with a sweet aftertaste.
B0042816YK|5.0|Lovely, funny and inspiring movie. It gave me hope for the future. I highly recommend it to anyone going through a divorce.
B009JZTP4Y|2.0|This movie was pain fully slow to develop. There were long panning shots of the ship and it surroundings with no dialogue that just went on and on. The entire thing could have been condensed to a fairly entertaining 45min episode, but what we got instead was difficult to get through.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is really creative and I love it also its just like subway surf and it FUNNY when the fart gun was shot and my mom person was hitting the other people.

B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I like it but it needs more time in the day. I think you should put at least 20 or 30 minutes on it.But I still like it.Also I think it's to realistic.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I've long suspected wheat was the culprit. This book confirms it. Davis presents his facts in non-scientific terms, which makes for a good read. Some of the recipes seem a bit extreme and going completely wheat-free is impractical if you don't have celiac disease. But Davis makes a great case for reducing wheat consumption.<br /><br />Star Review recommends this book, especially if you are struggling with weight.

B003WUYRGI|5.0|It is helpful for my kids . No internet to use it . I could not live if I don't have it
B00CFQMVLS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I have always loved all of the Die Hard movies. I have read reviews about how the plot was terrible and that the one-liners were awful. I personaly loved the one-liners especially \\"I'm on vacation!\\", which is said by some to be reundant. I cant imagine why people didn't like the plot or how they can say it was too loose. I was slightly worried about going to see this movie because the more a series of movies progresses, the easier it is for the director and writer to mess it up, plus it had gotten very poor reviews. However, another part of my mind said that it would probobly be better than the reviews had said. I am not usually on the same side of things as critics when it comes to movies. I usually love movies that critics say are terrible, such as Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. Other movies that people tought were akin to the Holy Grail, I thought were terrible. The bottom line is that I love this movie and would definetly recomend this movie to anyone who likes action movies or Bruce Willis.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is very helpful for me i love, it when i need to know what a word mean and  Good for school . Love it !!!!!!!!!

B00913P6G0|4.0|Absolutely great album, perfect lyrics & amazing production throughout every single track<br /><br />Track 2,3,4,5,8, and 10 are my favorite on the album and will most likely be regarded as classics in the future.<br /><br />Kendrick Lamar brings fresh and very talented music to the game through very powerful messages, definitely one of the best albums of the year that it was released

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has written many good books.  &#34;Safe Haven&#34; was also made into a movie.  I suggest you read the book before viewing the movie, as there are several differences which, though minor, have an impact on how you enjoy the movie.  In the book, for example, the hero (owner of a hardware store) is described as a middle-aged man with white hair.  In the movie the hero is a much younger man.  The plot revolves about a love triangle between a woman, her abusive husband, and another man (her hero) she finds as she flees from her husband to a small town which she considers to be a safe haven--until her husband (a police officer) finds out where she is.  Danger and excitement build as she slowly falls in love with the other man and the consequences which ensue.  You will enjoy the book--probably more than the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cute. I love this game. I downloaded it on my kindle like one week ago, and I've been playing it ever since.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Nicholas Sparks has a winner in the book &#34;The Lucky One&#34;.  The story is well told and has romance, danger, excellent character development, and an ending (epilog) which will keep you on the edge of your seat.  As the plot unfolds you will meet Theibold, who finds a picture of a woman in Iraq and walks from Colorado all the way to North Carolina to find her.  Her name is Elizabeth (Beth), and she is a divorcee who has a son named Ben.  Beth works with her grandmother, who operates a dog kennel.  When Theibold learns where Beth is, he asks for a job at the kennel, but does not tell Beth about the picture.  The rest of the story (as Paul Harvey would say) is yours to discover when you read this excellent novel.
0375869026|5.0|A couple years ago, I read Sharon Draper's Out of My Mind, a novel told from the perspective of an 11-year-old girl living with cerebral palsy.  In the same vein, R. J. Palacio's book Wonder tells the story of August, a 5th grader with a cranio-facial condition.  He has been homeschooled all his life, and now is entering 5th grade at a prep school in his neighborhood.  Wonder takes us through his fifth grade year, telling his story through first-person narratives of August, his sister, and some of their friends and classmates.<br /><br />I don't know anyone with a condition like August's.  If I have ever met or seen someone with it, I don't remember.  But I'm sure I would be one who might take a double take, or try to sneak a look.  August  is on the receiving end of those looks and stares every day of his life.  Worse, he gets bullied and mocked in his new school.  It's bad enough being the new kid.  It's bad enough being a kid, period, when so many kids are mean.  But August endures the worst of it.<br /><br />The story of Wonder shows that awful side of kids, but, more importantly, Palacio paints a picture of how it ought to be.  August has a loving, supportive family (I've read of children with such conditions whose parents give them up for adoption shortly after birth).  At his new school he quickly makes friends with kids who are willing to see past his appearance.  He's a smart, gifted child.  I'm sure August's experiences are much better than those of many people with facial anomalies, and some might criticize Wonder as being too idealistic, but I think Palacio wants to model more than report.<br /><br />August reflects on how other people see him: \\"It's like people you see sometimes, and you can't imagine what it would be like to be that person, whether it's somebody in a wheelchair or somebody who can't talk. . . . I know that I'm that person to other people. . . .\\"  Wonder reminds us, as the middle school director reminds his charges, \\"always to try to be a little kinder than is necessary,\\" especially when we see \\"those people,\\" whoever they are for us.a little kinder than is necessary,\\" especially when we see \\"those people,\\" whoever they are for us.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|This is the most poorly written Jack Reacher that I have read. Not up to writers previous works by a long shot.<br />Where to go from here, or do I read any more Reacher books? You can tell the writer is off when he allowed Tom<br /><br />Cruise to portray Reacher in film, that is like getting a Hobbit to play King Kong.
B000TSUCAQ|5.0|I got this as a gift for someone who loved to cook and was also really into star wars. She loved it!
0060174900|5.0|This book is a very moving account of a young girl in her twenties Esther Greenwood, who is an immensely talented writer/poet but who is increasingly disaffected with the smallness and pettiness of the world and her life and does not know what to do about it. Set around NYC in the mid-50s, in this autobiographical novel the author does not adopt an all-wise psychological analytical approach to her character, but lets the confusions and uncertainties of Esther come through unvarnished.<br /><br />The book is most definitely commentary on normality and convention and the lengths to which authority figures will go to enforce accepted behaviors. Those who find themselves in a depressed state usually have no answers, but are vulnerable to those who claim to have solutions in hand. In Esther's case, most disturbing is how quickly medical professionals decided that she needed to be confined to a facility and undergo electro-shock treatments. Perhaps those treatments were needed, but clearly she had gotten little guidance in her adolescence in how to cope with the world in a manner consistent with her own personality.<br /><br />This is a very affecting novel knowing that the author took her own life only a month after its publication. The author's approach is hardly morbid. She is quite observant and there is no little subtle humor. Unfortunately, Esther/Sylvia's unlimited potential was cut short.

B004T4KQJS|5.0|As a long time Scientific American reader, I've been through lots of material on these topics including Krauss's own articles. This is hard stuff to wrap your head around but facinating as well. Krauss is as good as anyone at making it easier to comprehend and he's more honest than most about the limitations of our knowledge. The truth is, even the best scientists struggle to grasp these ideas because they are not consistant with everyday experience. But I'll take complicated nature over simplistic belief in some supernatural force. Krauss builds on a solid body of experimental and mathematical knowledge and extrapolates to possibilites we can barely imagine, but at least the foundation is based in reality and not what gives us emotional comfort. So if you're willing to begin a journey whose end is nowhere is sight, hop aboard. It's a wild ride.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the characters. They are complex and interesting like real people. After watching the first two seasons during my summer break last year on Hulu. I was disappointed when I could not find season 3 until I found them on Amazon.
0061478784|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />\\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" subverted my expectations in surprising ways. Reading the first couple of chapters, I anticipated a romantic adventure story filled with fairy-tale tropes turned on their heads. But as I progressed, I discovered a complicated, intriguing puzzle involving a bargain with a fire demon, an evil witch, a scarecrow, a dog, two vanished members of a royal court, and the true nature of the Wizard Howl and of the protagonist, Sophie Hatter, herself.<br /><br />Sophie has resigned herself to a boring lifetime of running a hat shop in the little town of Market Chipping. Believing in the misfortune of being firstborn, she thinks little of her own abilities, although she possesses a magical talent for creating alluring clothes and hats, as well as other gifts as yet undiscovered.<br /><br />When the spiteful Witch of the Waste visits the hat shop, she casts a spell on Sophie that turns her into an old woman. Sophie runs away, determined to seek her fortune, although, as the eldest, she expects to fail. She finds herself at the doorway of the Wizard Howl's moving castle, which drifts continually about the nearby countryside. Howl has a terrible reputation as a stealer of souls and eater of hearts of young girls, but Sophie believes she is safe in her old-woman guise and just wants to sit in a comfortable chair by a warm fire.<br /><br />In the castle she meets Michael, Howl's eager but sometimes clueless apprentice, and Calcifer the fire demon, who heats and powers the castle from his grate in the hearth. Calcifer has grown weary of a mysterious contract he made with Howl, which traps him inside the castle. He strikes a bargain with Sophie: If she can discover how to break his contract, he will remove the witch's spell.<br /><br />Sophie soon learns Howl is not evil, but an immensely talented, creative wizard who is appallingly vain and self-absorbed, with a tendency toward drama-queen antics at the least provocation. His main hobby is persuading young girls to fall in love with him, then losing interest as soon as they return his affection. Above all, Howl is a \\"slitherer-outer,\\" preferring to wiggle his way out of difficult, uncomfortable situations rather than facing them. At the moment, he is most concerned about avoiding an appointment as royal wizard and an order from the king to find his brother and the previous royal wizard, who presumably both ran afoul of the witch. Howl is in fact hiding from the witch, who cast a curse that has not yet \\"caught up\\" to him.<br /><br />Sophie sees right through Howl's vanity and cowardice and lets him know it with her tongue-lashing scolds. One of the delights of the novel is how it plays with Sophie's old woman disguise. Sophie accepts her new form rather easily, as she already feels like an old, defeated woman. But freed from her normal outward appearance, and thus people's expectations of her, she finds her own pluck and strong will. As the novel progresses, she begins to behave more and more like the outspoken, impulsive young woman she truly is inside.<br /><br />Howl also reveals himself to be more than he seems on the surface. He never has a nice word for Sophie, but he shows his kindness and affection for her in surprising, subtle ways. Despite all differences and their tendency to bicker, the group in the castle becomes a strange sort of family. Their loyalty to each other will be tested when Howl's problems at last catch up to him, and he must face both the Witch of the Waste and the darker implications of his contract with Calcifer.<br /><br />This thoughtful novel has less adventure and a much slower pace than I anticipated, although I flew through the pages during the last third, as the pieces of a carefully laid puzzle began to come together. Seemingly small details, such as Sophie rescuing a dog tangled in a rope, became important later. Some of the plot twists seemed a bit forced, and I did not always agree with the author's choices. I also thought the book dragged in spots. But the characters were so appealingly drawn, and the final chapters so brilliantly written, I easily forgave these flaws.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll want to read this book again soon (or perhaps listen to it) as it had multiple layers as well as plot points I'm sure I missed the first time through. I really had to stay alert and use my brain while reading.  I appreciated how the author left certain themes and happenings open to the reader's interpretation, while still bringing the story to a satisfying and convincing conclusion.o thought the book dragged in spots.

B005LAIHGI|2.0|This film came across as an early second draft - lots of good ideas that haven't quite jelled. Sacha Baron Cohen played Admiral General (ha-ha!) Aladeen, the ruthless Arab-ish dictator of the east African country of Wadiya. He loves grand titles, overly-decorated uniforms, giving himself awards, his golden limo and his retinue of red-bereted, gorgeous female bodyguards. So, the film is set up to be an over-the-top satire about excess of power in the Arab world. But it kind of goes nowhere.<br /><br />Imagine Borat with a love story attached. That's what you have here. A weird pairing of a violent, domineering, sexist, abusive and racist tyrant with his polar opposite - Zoey, a peace-loving, armpit-hairy feminist and natural foodie. The combination does not work. Aladeen insults Zoey and all women, and she just finds him charming. The film can't seem to decide whether to play Aladeen as a bad guy or a nice one. He sentences many people to die. He admits to having sex with small boys. He has sex with legions of prostitutes. He threatens the West with nukes. But he is redeemable because he is lonely (shades of Team America!) and falls in love with a working girl?<br /><br />The film is not a total loss. The scene in which Aladeen tries to deliver a baby (and leaves his cellphone inside Mom) was fun, if not actually funny. His argument with a CIA torturer (about who had the latest pain-inflicting devices) was almost topical. But so much was left undeveloped. His solid gold limo was a great visual, but was not put to use. As were his hotalicious body guards, who were good for only one sight gag, where an idiot shepherd tries to milk them.<br /><br />\\"The Dictator \\" is a mess of unfunny crudity, gross out humor, a ridiculous plotline, pointless ethnic jabs and missed opportunities at satire - or just plain comedy. Some bits are so tone-deaf and badly written (prime example: the helicopter ride with 9/11 references) that even the cast could not possibly have thought them funny. His big speech at the end (using actual American political reality - e.g., \\"You could let 1% of the people have all the nation's wealth\\" -- as the way a true dictator should act) was preachy and out of place.<br /><br />SBC is a gifted artist. But next time, he really needs to ditch his ego before inflicting another travesty on the public like this vile klunker.unny.

B0033H7VI6|1.0|I bought this knife to replace my lost Ka-bar, and figured it would be thicker and more rugged.  However, upon arrival I took it hiking and it is already damaged.  I damaged it chopping a 1 inch wide oak stick (to make a smaller stick so I could throw it for my dog).  The edge is now rough with visible damage when you look closely.<br /><br />This is not what I would expect from a good 1095 steel knife, especially one this thick.  If this really is 1095, it must be an AWFUL heat treatment, because my old Ka-bar would have easily performed such an easy and simple task without a mark.  Also, the knife came so dull it cannot cut a cardboard box (my first test) at all... its like hitting the box with a metal spoon...<br /><br />This is a great knife design, just with inferior steel and quality control.  I'd stick with a becker bk2 for a thick knife.

0060531053|3.0|This is a great book, though the authors method of writing and many of the \\"playfully\\" illustrations become grating after a while.<br />After the second chapter, I was tired of reading \\"Relax! Have a homebrew!\\" It just got old after a while.<br /><br />At any rate, it comes with a lot of recipes, some good, some not. It also comes with a lot of useful information that will take a first time brewer a long way.<br /><br />On the whole I'd say it's worth the buy, but it's got about the same information as any other book along its lines.<br /><br />If I could rate it at 3.5, I defiantly would.

The protagonist, Ender, is too good to be fully credible so, in that sense, it felt like reading an old Hornblower adventure. But, on balance, this was an interesting recreational read.

B00CFA222M|5.0|This was very well made and it was fun.  The scenes were put together well.  Was entertaining and exciting. The family loved it.
B005FWO3QK|5.0|Vast spaces inhabit this cycle and also fabulous perfomances from all the principles. The Met's new cycle with D. Voight on DVD et al, with the exception of Kaufman, cannot compare. And that horrid set!<br /><br />Get this for the sharp, pounding conducting as well. It will thrill you no end. The subtitles also make things plainer than others do. The Levine set is comparable, with Norman and Behrens. But this is more dramatic, powerful, higher in vibartion. These singers believe in what they are singing, and how they sing out, with a kind of primitve sensuality not often heard in Wagner. Most singers tend to yell their heads off in lieu of a voice. Not here. Straight down the vocal line, especially Tomlinson and the exceptional Anne Evans..incredible high notes, seering expressions, dark lighting highlighting crisis after crisis. The Wotan of Tomlinson is gruff and gravely, but on target always with respect to notes and directions in the score. His is a brutal Wotan, hateful and yet crushed by Brunhilde's deception, as he interprets it in his chaotic world.He's in the groove at all times. Great! Evans lunges at him like a lover, imploring, beseeching in ravishing tones, and she is loud, not ever shaving off the tops of those trecherous high notes that come in batallions in this cycle for everyone in fact.<br />The rest of the cast in this endless cycle are excellent. The Fricka especially, and the confrontation with Wotan is violent and loud and moving all at once. And that music!!<br /><br />Mesmerizing and deeply moving. I salute Barenboim for this set.Buy it and enjoy it for many years.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|This was a very funny movie.  I just loved it.  It was a refreshing side of Arnold.  I would like to see him in more of this type.
B00992CF6W|2.0|well i do like minecraft but i dont like the fact that you cannot join anymore  in the latist update  so i would like my money back if i cannot join because all i would do is join with my friend on my city world but if you like playing alone and your arts and crafty this is the game for you but it is also good fpr kids
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|My husband says this was an okay movie.  He stated that it was entertaining.  He is a retired military man, and had feels that our country needs to always back up military.  Amen.....
B003VANOFY|4.0|Bought these roughly a year ago and i had the same problem a lot of other people had that it would keep disconnecting. Settled with it for a long time as they are quite expensive till they got pretty annoying for a while and bought G35 instead. Went back to them recently about 6 months ago to see if other people had figured out the problem and tried their ways. Worked for some time till one day they worked a VERY long time without disconnecting. Turns out i dropped the dongle on the floor and for some reason they work MUCH better that way. 1 disconnect for every like 5-8 hours average. Just thought i share my experience with them and how they work for me.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|These two girls are so funny.  I love their antics.  It is a little over the top sometimes, but it is fun to watch.
1490550623|5.0|Chomi Prag's debut novel is called Cult of Mirrors.  After harrowing experiences with both the trial and appellate courts for a case she works on the protagonist attorney, Cheryl, falls prey to an opportunistic man named Travis. Seeking to escape the pressures of her cases and her loneliness Travis gets Cheryl involved with the taking of drugs and that's not the only evil which surrounds Travis.  Cheryl's life turns into one crazy array of surveillance on her in all forms. Nothing is safe from prying eyes not her computer, her home, her office, her car, nor her phone. Cheryl experiences hallucinations of a demonic nature but the line between what's real and what may be figments of her paranoid mind becomes blurred. Prag's wry humor and laugh out loud scenes lends her writing a Carl Hiassen of Milwaukee type feel. Her voice is unique and Cult of Mirrors makes for some easy and fast reading. It's a great book to take a long on a long plane ride or to take to the beach or just read at home in a nice chair. This is a must read for anyone who thought those clicks on the phone might mean that somebody was listening in. In this day and age fiction is not too far from reality...You won't want to put this one down...
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|This series was awesome.  I loved it.  But of course I love unusual.  I am just sad that this is the last.  Very good actors and cute too.
0061998494|5.0|Craig's charm shines through in his memoir, making it an easy and entertaining read. I watch his Late Late Show and this is a look inside the man that he is on the tv...a great read and a must read for any Craig fan!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Very Nice, we enjoying altogether with some friends, at home with pop corn; it was very entertaining for the summer time season.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read the last page and kept trying to turn it to read MORE! Anxiously awaiting the next book! LOVED!
1440503257|5.0|I got this for a friend of mine and she loves it! She is finding a lot of recipes that are super easy and sound delicious.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I like how available tiles are highlighted. Helped alot. Played other apps and they don't do this. Gave it 5 stars despite the tiles being soooo thick on the screen you can't see the ones on the next row up if the stack is higher next row down. Would be way less playable if not for the highlights.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app! best app ever..subway surfers and temple run tiger equals minion rush! I love this app. very fun
B00886184A|4.0|I've tended to find Gentle Giant hit or miss, and mostly miss, so I was skeptical.  And then there were some pretty bad reviews of the later albums. But I found it pretty cheap, so I took a chance, figuring that I'd find something or other worth listening to. If nothing else, there was Playing the Fool, and I already knew they were pretty awesome live.<br /><br />So what you get are 5 studio albums, a live double album, and some bonus tracks (mostly single versions, which I didn't find very interesting). There's also a booklet with an interview, liner notes, etc.<br /><br />And here they are, in my order of preference:<br />Playing the Fool<br />  live double album from 1976. Hard to go wrong with this one.<br /><br />Free Hand<br />  now my favorite Gentle Giant studio album, displacing The Power and the Glory<br /><br />The Missing Piece<br />  This one often gets dissed as a slide into commercialism. I don't think so. The drums have some longer segments of a straight-forward beat, but it's more like Fragile-era Yes than a sell-out. There's still plenty of off-beat rhythms and quirky madrigal-like stuff. Just listen to the whole album instead of stopping at track 3. And I view &#34;Betcha Thought We Couldn't Do It&#34; in the same way as some of the silly sound effects and other nonsense that they did on earlier albums. One thing I did notice is that the vocal lines tend to be a little less choppy. I like this. Overdoing the jumpy vocals is one of my criticisms of early Gentle Giant. I have to say that this one goes ahead of The Power and the Glory as well.<br /><br />Interview<br />  Chronologically, this comes between the above 2 albums. There are some really good parts, but I don't think it's nearly as good overall. It's not as good as The Power and the Glory.<br /><br />Giant for a Day<br />  They missed it on this one. This could have been their best album, but they went overboard into the mire of radio-friendliness. There are a lot of good vocal melodies here -- downright catchy sometimes. If they hadn't succumbed to over-simplification and a nauseating level of repetition, this album could have fit in with the best Kansas or Yes had to offer. It's not really all that bad of an album, but it's so disappointing because I can easily envision what it could have been.<br /><br />Civilian<br />  One step further down the path of mediocrity.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is a sequel...well  worth the read.  Curious as to amount of content or style attributed solely to Mr. Clancy.
B000001F59|3.0|the good:<br />Stranded, except for repeating the title way too much.<br />Can't Let You Go, probably my favorite Rainbow song (yeah, Dio era included). Cool keyboard intro.<br />Anybody There, a descent instrumental<br />Desperate Heart<br />Street of Dreams, one of my favorites all the way back to teen years when it played on the radio<br />Snowman, a nice instrumental<br /><br />I don't much care for the rest.<br /><br />I don't really understand the reviews that portray this album as Rainbow going commercial. Okay, the keyboards are richer and more pad-oriented than those in the early albums. And the guitars have a smoother tone than, say, Straight Between the Eyes. So the overall sound is richer and more Pink Floyd like. But more commercial? Compared to what? All the Rainbow albums are pretty radio-friendly.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I love every single song on this album. I can't say that about many.My favorite is &#34;My songs know what you did the dark&#34;
B000001FB6|4.0|This was a really good comeback album. It's pretty straight-forward rock & roll in the Machine Head vein. Some nice hooks, good vocals, and some of the classic lead trade-offs and doublings between guitar and keyboard.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Have watched it numerous times over the past several months.  Waiting for Red2.  Too bad Morgan Freeman won't be in 2, as he was great in the first movie.
B0027LZ4CE|4.0|Most (maybe all) are live recordings in what sounds like a pretty large auditorium. There is a fair amount of natural reverb, but they're modern recordings, so don't get the impression of some muddy 1950's recording. It's not like that. It's more like you're in the concert hall. In general, I don't like a lot of reverb and I can't stand muddy recordings, so take that as a reference when I say that it sounds fine to me.<br /><br />I don't have anything to say as for comparison with other recordings of these works. This is my first complete set, and it's been years since I've heard any Bruckner. If this is your first foray into Bruckner, go ahead and give it a try. If you're a Bruckner expert, check out other reviews, since I don't have much to offer.
B008C401YG|5.0|I love the resonance is Sean's voice.  I listen to this CD over and over again.  I had heard the review on NPR.  It was spot on.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Is this album perfect? No, but the hits far outweigh the misses. Tony absolutely shines on every track. Even the bonus tracks are worthy of cranking to eleven. The fact that Bill Ward is not present only bothered me for the first listen or so, but after that I was lost in the stellar musicianship and excellent tunes. If this ends up being the swan song for Sabbath (And God I hope not) what a way to go!
B000002UTY|4.0|I listened to the vinyl version during my college years and loved it then.  Had to get the CD to add to my current music collection.  Takes me back.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|I bought this because I have loved Queensryche since Mindcrime.  I was curious to hear how the group would sound w/out Geoff Tate.  I was not disappointed!! Despite the ongoing feud between the &#34;two' Queensryche camps, this Q camp decided to stick with what helped to make them what they are today-by getting a singer who sounds like GT.  If I hadn't known they got a new singer I would have thought the original lineup (minus Chris Degarmo) got back together!  Great Job Guys!!!
B000HF0IIC|4.0|I enjoyed Batman Forever, for the most part. It's colorful, dark at times, and easy to follow. Great performances were turned in by Nicole Kidman, Tommy Lee Jones, and to an extent Jim Carrey and Val Kilmer. Carrey is a tad over the top as the Riddler, while Kilmer somehow doesn't have the same resonance as Michael Keaton, though his performance isn't bad at all. The most obvious thing about this movie is its lighter tone compared to the first two movies. The result is a movie that can appeal to a wider audience, which I think it did. However, that doesn't make it a better movie; this movie occasionally suffers from corny and tacky parts that sort of disrupt parts that are darker and more emotional. I give Batman Forever a respectable 3.5 stars, and deem it a worthy watch. The music score is good too.
B006K1IIHA|2.0|Really disappointed and should have read the reviews. I was so looking forward to seeing this but it would not play on my Sony Blu-ray player. Maybe this will be fixed and I'll be able to see the series eventually.
0143039431|5.0|\\"The dawn came, but no day.  In the gray sky a red sun appeared, a dim red circle that gave a little light, like dusk; and as that day advanced, the dusk slipped back toward darkness, and the wind cried and whimpered over the fallen corn.  Men and women huddled in their houses, and they tied handkerchiefs over their noses when they went out, and wore goggles to protect their eyes.\\"<br /><br />The description of the dust storms that contributed to the collapse of  midwestern American farm life is how John Steinbeck chose to open his masterpiece \\"[[ASIN:0143039431 The Grapes of Wrath]].\\"  The remainder of the book focuses on one Oklahoma family, the Joads, and their attempts to create a better life for themselves in California during the Great Depression.<br /><br />There are several things that stood out to me in this novel.  First, Steinbeck's writing is exceptional.  His characters are sympathetic, his prose moving and the vernacular he uses transports the reader to a different time and place.  Second, though Steinbeck did not himself have firsthand knowledge of the plight of the \\"Okies\\", he uses (then) contemporary research he gained from interviewing someone who did.  It's those small nuances that impress me so much.  For instance, how the family is constantly trying to keep their car running, by patching tires and borrowing or making parts.  How food is stretched out by frying dough or serving cornmeal mush.  Third, although the family's hardships are certainly heart-wrenching, Steinbeck also takes the time to instruct the reader on the various causes for those hardships.  Yes, the Okies were taken advantage of.  But when the crop prices bottomed out, Steinbeck told how the orchard owners struggled to decide whether to let the fruit rot or to pay the pickers less.<br /><br />I'm sure many reading this novel would focus on the wrongs done to these migrant workers by the California natives or corporate owners.  Though it wasn't mentioned in the book, I know that mistakes made by those in Washington DC contributed just as much to the Great Depression.  I found myself more angry at those public policy makers while reading this book than anyone else.<br /><br />One beautiful message Steinbeck delivers is how the downtrodden consistently help each other.  Even though they have nothing, they share what they have.  In a world of darkness and despair, those acts of kindness are the beacons of hope that shine in this story.istakes made by those in Washington DC contributed just as much to the Great Depression.

B00BN3ECTS|5.0|I was quite impressed with Julianne's acting, she's quite believable. Josh always is for me but she's less experienced and this isn't a role where she can just smile and be cute. Definitely worth buying and seeing many times.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I was really surprised by the packaging concept used, just like the old LP's with cover notes in the first sleeve and a CD designed to feel like an LP in the 2nd sleeve.  great songs and a very surprising vocal ensemble.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The movie was good, but I think with all the hype I had higher expectations. The special effects were good, but some of the choices of actors seemed a bit off from their characterization of the role in the movie. Overall it was enjoyable, but I wouldn't go out and purchase the dvd for a personal collection.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The book was well written and very informative. It is a little frightening but showed me a lot about the mental IDE of war.
0425263924|5.0|she cant put it down, loves it as she has loved all of Sylvia Day's books. Cant wait for the next one
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|This movie score by Hans Zimmer is just EPIC! It fits the tone of the movie in every way, can't stop playing it in my car. The movie itself is such a fresh take on Superman that I really appreciated, it's an original adaptation like the 1978 Donner version and should be treated as such. The Superman mythology was stuck to and respected combined with a fresh story to make the character more relevant. This movie has more emotion yet more action than any Superhero movie! The action shows what would happen if over powered aliens like Kryptonians fight on earth.It's a wonderful origin story, Clark was barely Superman for 48 hours, you know he's not a seasoned hero yet,  the fight scenes are epic and this score my Hans Zimmer does the movie justice. Everything about this movie makes sense! Zod's mission makes sense, Superman discovering his heritage makes sense and Lois knowing who he is makes sense. This movies shows what Superman would do to save humans even when he's pushed to his limits.  I loved it!  The score is amazing though!!
0425263916|5.0|great book she says loves all of Sylvia Day's books and cant wait for the next one. loves the book
091581112X|5.0|I can't tell you how much I love this book.  I've learned so much from it and I am so glad that I ordered it.  Sometimes you find yourself purchasing a book and you're disappointed with it.  I was not disappointed in this one.  Maybe another reader will have another opinion but this is mine.  I love this book.
B008XX6J4C|2.0|The music on this cd is not my taste in music. It didn't have the rhythm I prefer. I won't listen to it very often.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|5 of 5 stars. Bruce Lee in HD. Enter the Dragon is a martial arts masterpiece. Must have movie for Bruce Lee fans. Get it!
B00846REIS|4.0|Very intense. So many unsuspecting parts to this book. You will always be on the edge of your seat. Sylvia Day is an amazing author.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's my go to escape from my life trilogy. I'm reading these for the 10th time as we speak. Don't really get the hatred this book generates. I say read first then judge whether you like it or not later.

B00A23MYCC|5.0|Enjoyed it! Laughed my butt off, but there was some slow parts.<br />A lot of twelve year old humor, but so is anything from Seth.  Which is good.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Love this app. I can shop keep track of my orders and build my wish list and view it anywhere.

B002RKSCA6|4.0|This book was absolutely NOTHING I thought it was....it was better. Hollywood would not be able to get the real story right, it is simply, well you have to read it for yourself.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a great game. Lots of fun and entertainment. It's like temple run but so much better. My toddler loves playing it.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I went back and forth between three and four stars. It's not a four star as far as a great book, but it is a great teaching tool for parents and teachers. Lots of messages our young people need.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved Season 3 storylines.  Maggie Smith is amazing as the Dowager Countess, her timing and humor are one of the show's best qualities!
B00000DHR0|5.0|Celine Dion always touches my heart when she sings.  Her voice is sent from up above.  She makes you believe &#34;These are Special Times&#34;..
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|My wife told me she loved it so a chose this rating. I don't know more I can say about the book I have not read it.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This product is a great tool for the beginner glass craftsman. It was somewhat tricky to assemble but nothing too difficult. Everything turns out pretty good.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Good variation of the musical seen on stage.  I like the alternate ending and opening that the producers and writers provided to this classic.  Love the music.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Everything was perfect. Enjoyed watching the movie again: it is a classic. No problems with it playing, pausing, stopping, etc.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is awesome that is why I bought it I finished tatoine and the death star  star wars but my favorite is revenge of the sith episode 3 I like it cause Darth Vader but I also like the phantom menace episode 1cause of Darth maul but I like them all and this is a cool game.
B003297I1U|5.0|I bought this item for my son! He is 3 years old, though he plays with it very well. Nice quality product and very reliable. Thanks a lot for it
B0092S4WLY|3.0|It is a very fun game but there are only a few rooms! It is very challenging and I hope they come out with new rooms soon!!

B00CDV6WDS|5.0|this is the best mahjong game i've played so far. it appears to be glitch-free, and it looks really lovely &amp; has plenty of layouts. i like that you can choose your own background and the tiles are easy to see. i think other reviewers have covered everything else...

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Entertaining. Had fun for awhile. I wish there were more levels ready to play now. Ughh its frustrating. I'm ready for more
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This story is dear to me.  Once again Mr. Sparks has hit it dead on.  Telling the thoughts of the abuser adds to the aspect of realizing the \\"whole\\" story.  No reasoning in abuse of any kind.
B00005NWLO|5.0|Do I have to say much more?<br />I saw the first show of the Street Survivors tour in Hollywood Florida (The old Sportatorium) in 1977.<br />Second to last show. Second to last time Free Bird was played.<br />What a Freakin' show! Picture 10,000 kids in a smoke filled metal barn. The place went nuts!<br />We used to listen to this album in '76 when I was in high school.<br />Captures the Skynyrd live experience. Sound quality is great for a alive album. A must have for any REAL Skynyrd fan! Bonus tracks are a great new addition.<br />Live on Ronny!!!
B005FRF6PC|4.0|Enjoyable read, with insights into his mental state during slam finals against Fed, and Djok.  A bit repetitious with his personal life, which left me feeling like I was getting a small window into that side of him.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Good story. The \\"alternate\\" story was just disturbing.<br /><br />It all comes down to this; he could've chosen to live or let himself die. He chose to live.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculated.  Easy to use and easy to read.  Some of the other ones were too confusing and I just needed something simple!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like the game a lot. Though it is hard to play on a small screen because you can't get the detail in. Cool game!
0312853254|5.0|It is rare these days to find a book that is so good that you simply can't put it down.  This is one of them.  I just could not stop reading it!  I finished it in 3 days.  Love it.
0920668364|5.0|I worked at a public library for several years and this book was one of the most circulated books.  I am invited to a book baby shower and this will be one of the books I will give.

B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Let me preface this by saying I like Franco but he lacked the charisma to pull this off.  Not alone in this category, Mila's makeup was ridiculous along with her sexing up the old witch we all love to hate.
B009AMAGQM|4.0|I felt that the ending was anti-climactic and predictable. Sadly, this kind of spoiled it for me. Three more words
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It does remind me of several aspects of Myst. Excellent graphics. Beautifully presented. All to short. Can't wait for the next installment
B0086700CM|5.0|one of my kids got me to play this on their kindle and I was hooked. though not crazy graphic intense it is just a fun way to pass the time. still trying to beat my kids high score!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Oscar, enough said. I won't ruin ending, but you will find your self leaning closer to the tv every 10 to 15 mins figuring out will they make it in the end.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Not much to like.  I wonder if Follett actually wrote it.  If he actually did, WHY?  Given the theme It could not have possibly been for money, could it?
B004MKM8L8|1.0|Read the book, buy the audio book, but don't buy the movie 1 or 2. its aweful and they wreck it and rewrote it. book good movie bad.
0786958731|4.0|If you have Castle Raven loft and the Wrath of  Ashardalon, The legend of drizzt has stream lined encounters and  added long lasting Powers. If you don't have either of the first two then this is a must have.  The difficulty is hard as Castle Ravenloft.
B005LAIHQS|2.0|Will needs to retire, but Tommy stays! Will looks old, jokes are lame, and never really bought the plot.  Weak is best way to describe and I miss the &#34;Wonga&#34; guys.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Very funny, and very true. I loved this movie. The characters were great. I thought the whole thing was very funny.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Disney's best and glad to share with my kid. we enjoyed it again and again.  music with Elton john is great.
B006AN78XS|1.0|It felt like this movie was the middle of a good story. Maybe the book just didn't adapt well to a screenplay, but it could have been great if they would have told an entire story.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I've long had an intellectual curiosity about this afterlife stuff - if only to have fodder to irritate religious zealots in my life.  In the interest of being an objective debater, I bought this book in hopes of getting some ideas from the other side.  Don't go here for any objective information.  It's not here.  Reads more like someone's personal account of a very pleasant drug experience than any empirical support of the concept of a \\"heaven\\".  Leaves us atheists remaining unmoved.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was fun and challenging enough to keep you interested.  I highly recommend it for the whole family. Get it!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|lot of fun,with voices of some real good actors and actress,worth watch it followed well with the other 2 that came out already
B004ZNB12O|5.0|I really this because if I want to hear a bit of this and that, this satisfies my Pink Floyd craving.  But if you want to hear Dark Side of the Moon.......got to listen straight through.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|goods movie with a lot of violence,good actors well written movie,as ther americans go about trying to kill as many Germanys as they can
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just started playing but am really enjoying it so far. Really makes you think but in a more realistic way than other games. The puzzles make sense.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|the movies was really good,very good special affect that made the movies very enjoyable to watch,alot of action  worth seeing
B00AALHW6Y|1.0|The CD is overrated and its obvious that this artists success in country music is mostly hinged on the recent \\"politically correct\\" push for \\"diversity\\" in country music. All the major players gave him a pass from a cowardice fear of being called \\"racist\\". Basically, I don't think he would be as successful in country if he where not African American. I have heard many different artists cover \\"Wagon Wheel\\", and to be honest, they covered it better.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|excellent movie with tons of special effects one of the best movies of this type  to ever come out for now
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|This is defiantly the weakest of the three Hangover movies, but it is still worth seeing in following the trilogy!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|this movie was a lot of fun to watch,the whole movie was well written and very enjoyable to spend some time watching
B00AEFYCDW|3.0|The movie did drag for a bit, but it was still worth seeing.  Very good cast, especially Hal Holbrook who was fantastic!
B0030IIZ56|5.0|lot of fun to watch,well written with the voices of some of the best actors and actress on the planet
B000W93CHC|4.0|I always enjoy Ken's ability to have you despise a character so much that you want them dead but not until the very end do the hard working, honest characters win.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|well written movie,liam Nielsen does a real goods  job with his chartactor,trying to find out who had taken had daughter
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius Rucker has such a great voice and the lyrics are really good too.  Love the whole CD!  Have recommended it to friends.
B003UESJFG|5.0|the movies was good I really like all the animated movies that come out this one was one that was very enjoyable to watch
B006UIUJ2A|5.0|This is a book that changes the way you view the world in a fundamental way. My heart broke at the beauty and cruelty of it. Absolutely devastating.
B002ZG9940|4.0|George Clooney is very good does a real good job potraying ahit man that goes to Italy to do his job
B00AEBB97S|5.0|the dvd  was  of  good quality and cary grant and grace kelly were fantastic in it. anybody who wants to see great acting should see this, n t the garbage they are putting out these days.
B002ZG981E|4.0|good movie  with excellent special affects,as a lot of fun to watch well written with good group of actors.would defiantely tell someone to go see it
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|My grandsons watched it and really liked it.  I didn't watch it, except for a few parts and I don't think would have liked it.
B002ZG98UK|4.0|the movies was good but after seeing all the other version it seem to just get alittle old,ther is not really any great change in the movie it just follows with the umbrella company and that is all
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like the Kindle tablet  Edition but I think I like the version I have on my computer better.  It's early yet and I can change my mind.
B003UESJHE|5.0|wonderful movies,the whole thing is just great tow watch well written and great actors making this very enjoyable to watch
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The old version prior to beginning of July 2013 was a four star app.  This new version is terrible!  I spent a lot of time using the new version in an attempt to find any functionality but eventually determined it was junk.<br /><br />I can only surmise that a close relative of the CEO was hired to get the person away from a drug addiction. This person obviously had extremely limited experience with app development to create such a horrendous app.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Wow, Arnold being gone for all these years makes seeing him now really a shocker.  Still, he has that certain charisma, and charm, that made him popular in the 80's and 90's.  I always appreciate when actors show their age, and aren't afraid to cop to a bit of aches and pains.  Arnold does that here, and it makes him more believable, and more fun to watch.  Of course, the movie is full of incredibly hokey stunts, like the bad guy spinning a full 180 degree turn, stomping the brakes in front of a SWAT vehicle, and having it run right up the front and over (doing the obligatory flip, in the process).  It's even more unbelievable when you realize that the vehicle is a Vet, which are made of fiberglass, and disintegrate when the wind blows too hard.  Driving away with just a few scratches was rather comical.<br /><br />All-in-all, I enjoyed seeing Mr. S. on the screen again.  He hasn't lost his timing, or his comedic chops, and I respect his body of work for what it is, pure escapism and fun.  Good to see you again Arnold.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  Went deeper than what I would have expected out of a young adult book. A must read!
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Bruce still has some steam, but he's running on moxie and past performance, in these newer films (we'll throw Expendables in there as well).  We seriously need some new action stars, but they don't seem to be coming through the pipeline like they used to, and many of the new ones don't have the &#34;Awe Factor&#34; that guys like Willis did.  He still pulls off a good performance, and let's be honest, none of us buy these films for their believability (none of the bad guys can hit a barn).  Good for a nice night in, with a bowl of popcorn, when it's snowing outside and you've nothing better to do.
0425263924|4.0|I must say that when I first started reading the Crossfire Series I didn't like it. I thought the author was mirroring the characters in 50 Shades way too much but I gave the book a chance and kept reading. Once I got half way through book one, I was hooked!  By the time I got to book three I was skeptical about buying it because of the reviews but I had to see what was going to happen with Gideon & Eva.  I'm glad I bought it, I loved book three! I loved that they got to spend a lot of time together where they were getting along so well and were on the same page. Eva became less jealous & more secure in Gideon's love for her. Although I did think she was stupid every time he greed to meet up with, or talk to,  Brett (and I nearly lost it when she let him come up to her apartment) but overall there was growth in the characters.  My only disappointment is having to wait for a fourth book. By the way book three ended the author left room for more mystery & drama. I truly hope that Eva & Gideon get their happy ending..  This was the first time I've read books by this author. Great job Ms. Day please don't  keep us waiting too long. Looking forward to book four!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game is beast I love it. I also really like the movie trailer and I may be going to see it soon
B003VPWXRO|2.0|There were emotional adjectives used, but I hardly felt the emotion in the story. As a past anorexic myself, I feel like she prettied up the ugliness of the disease. I still struggle with an eating disorder...but I can't afford horses to help me get over it like Portia did. = (<br />If you found that sentence to be odd, then you probably won't like the ending either.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I have always loved this story. I enjoy the various forms of it in movie form. For me it is my favorite Christmas tradition.
0307887448|5.0|This is probably my new favorite book!!<br />If you have a general interest in science fiction, and/or video games, and/or 1980's pop culture then stop reading this now, and just buy the book! I won't discuss the plot of this book because other reviews have covered that very well, just know that this book REALLY appealed to my inner geek and I could not put it down! I was sad when I finished the book, because the awesome virtual journey it took me on was over. This is definitely a book that I will be reading again!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I suppose that there might be better alarm clock apps, maybe with more bells and whistles, but for 99 cents there is little to complain about and it has about everything I need in an alarm clock. I also really like the display. You can plug in the charger if you want the display to serve as a visible night clock and not drain the battery. It's very easy to use and set up with multiple alarms available. I only have two suggestions for future releases: The white noise generator for the sleep timer is not very loud even at the highest setting. If you're trying to block out noise, it falls a bit short here. And the white noise is a single pitch that sounds like radio<br />static. It would be nice to have a sine wave mode. The other issue is that there is a single alarm volume adjustment that adjusts all alarm settings together. So you can't have a low volume alarm for the bedroom and a high one for the office without changing the setting prior to the next alarm. But the only reason I'm bothering to write this review is that I really like the app. It feels good to pay so little for something I'll actually use.
0440242401|2.0|Could have been a cute book except for all the f bombs!  Could have been a cute book except for all the f bombs!
B00C061I3K|5.0|The actual art of the CD could have been cooler, but it is reminiscent of the older CD, which I suppose could be seen as an homage to a different time.<br /><br />Music quality is great.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|we have seen the movie before, but just needed a copy for our collection. It was a very good purchase.
0345529057|5.0|and books are books, cant complain, great deal. good size for books, not too bulky. great buy. It was a good gift.
B005LAIHZY|3.0|It was offered at a very low special pricing. When I attempted to order it, I was told they were sold out.then later the same day it was offered again at 4x the price, so I declined to order.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is one of my favorite prison movies!  How you can be wrongly accused but patiently wait for your time and your VICTORY!!!!
B000TDGGRY|4.0|Very nice adventure with ties to an ancient past that threatens to destroy the world! Oh, and a lot of action with guns a blazing!
B0043X1FL8|5.0|It's been awhile since I've seen this movie too but I love the patience of the doctor (Robert Williams) and Robert DeNior is wonderful in this movie.  One of my favorite seen is when Robert says &#34; everyone is asleep&#34; but Robert response &#34;i'm not&#34;.  Great movie!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Only thing I don't like is long waiting period before next book is released.  Because then you have to reread the others to catch back up to date.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I bought this for my Grandkids and they are watching it every day. It gives my daughter a little break to get odds and ends done around her home.
B005HV6Y5W|2.0|I can see what the director was going for. The movie was very artistic and visually stunning. I did still think it was pretty boring though. I remember watching it and just thinking the entire time \\"Holy cow... is this all the movie is going to be?\\" There are many parts of the movie that I'd call touching, and you can tell the director was going for some kind of \\"nothing matters in life beyond the love we have for each other\\" type vibe... but it just didn't work for me. I was somewhat touched by the film... but I was bored. Plain and simple. I think this movie walked a fine line right on the border of \\"total boredom\\" and \\"best movie ever.\\" Unfortunately, it fell into the \\"total boredom\\" category for me.<br /><br />I think, personally, that this movie could have a learned a couple things from the movie Waterworld starring Kevin Costner. Waterworld was packed with action, suspense, romance, and even a couple 'o yucks. From the moment the Universal Studios Logo melts into the waterworld to the very last frame of the film, you will be on the edge of your seat. Waterworld holds a special place in the hearts of it's viewers across the world and most of them, like me, watch it every Saturday night (I assume).<br /><br />In summary, The Tree of Life is not Waterworld. I think that is what people need to understand. If you watch this film you just need to keep that in mind. The people who got so upset when they saw this film were probably the ones who had not realized this before they walked into the theater.
B008G12ERC|5.0|I love every track! As usual Muse comes through with another excellent CD.  I am very happy with the purchase.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I found this book via the authors business website.  I was pleasantly suprised at its content.  It offers some interesting ideas that may prove benificial in generating conversation around the workplace.
B005DD7H50|5.0|This movie goes to the heart of what I think is awesome about the ability of human beings to adapt. The potential for better access to our brain power is a near reality. Though it will not likely come from using  a drug. Bradley Cooper  gives a strong performance!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Always wanted to learn the game and this makes it easy!<br />Also has good directions for the user to understand.
1574216988|2.0|Nothing you can't easily find on the interneet.  I wouldn't waste your money.  Maybe it just depends on your intention (for Zentangling).
B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|I liked the LOTR movies. But this one is better. More action and a lot of fun. I read the book a million years ago, and the movie has a lot of added things and changed things, but the essence of the story, I suppose, is still there. Super pretty and fun to watch.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Red is a good mix of action and humor featuring a great cast. So easy to rent from Amazon. Can't wait to see Red 2.
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|The book is waaaaaay better, but the movie is good! I was surprised. It's a white washed version of the story. A lot of detail is missing and some things are changed, but the essence of the story is there.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|good for the whole family!  very entertaining... keeps my 10 year old, 7 year old and 3 year old busy for a little while!!
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I'M NOT SURE IF ITS WORKING,I STILL GET A MESSAGE SAYING INSTALL/DOWNLOAD FLASH ADOBE AFTER DOING SO I STILL GET THE SAME MESSAGE
B002HFJ77S|4.0|This book was fun to read.  The premise is a bit out there, but I loved the heroine and was rooting for her and her crazy aunt from beginning to the fairy tale ending.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I liked this book, but it didn't appeal as much as the first to my sense of darkness! Can't wait to read Storm of Swords.
B009MYARIK|1.0|I have really enjoyed all of Sofie kinsella's books.  They are fun and generally laugh out loud funny.  However this novel was a disappointment from beginning to the end.  I only kept reading it because I was sure it would get better,  was I ever wrong.  It goes down as one of the dumbest and lamest books I've ever read.  I recommend not wasting your money
B003WUYRGI|3.0|It was great when I was on the go and I had to look up a word I would just go to Oxford dictionary and look up the word I needed  so if you have a kindle or an iPad get the Oxford American dictionary now.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Never make an auto-correct mistake, and there are so many customizations that make it easier to use. Predictions are very intelligent, and it learns as it goes. I just wish it were slightly less heavy feeling on my rooted galaxy nexus.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I'm so sorry my little brother wrote that review it was the one  that said it was so boring I like you dictionary because when I'm rideing  in the car and I need to look up a word I would just go to the books and go to the Oxford American dictionary so I'm so sorry and all you people out there that saw my latest review Oxford American dictionary is so reliable
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it!!<br />It's really fun to play. It has done easy things and difficult challenges at the same time. The multiple levels make it funner
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|After completing chapter one,  I am requested to submit a review of one of the best challenging mind games I have ever played.  It has taken me two weeks to get this far,but it has been worth the trip.  BUY this game and improve your brain power.<br />Dfindt@comcast
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It is a cute catching story of course all fantasy but some what of what a woman would like from a man. Show LOBE and affection.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love it!<br />This is a good series, although I think 4 is a bit much considering you already wrote a series of 6.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Lots of fun. Really makes you think. Plenty of levels so there is always more. Get this app!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Can barely, barely wait for the sequels.  First movie I've ever watched at least 20 times, and could easily watch it another 20, 30, 40, or more.
B009LMTDL0|1.0|Really Sheryl - you just don't get it.  You had a meteoric rise and got to the power seat before you had a chance to experience what most every woman has had to experience.  You do not have a touch point with reality.  Too many women leaned in and got their feet swept out from under them by their male and female colleagues if they showed their skills so quickly it would make your head spin.  Working in corporate means you have to watch your back all the time and gauge your words and actions so as not to be considered a competitor until it's too late for you to be sabotaged.  Will has nothing to do with is, nor does skill, ethics, agility or dedication - if you want to succeed in corporate you have to be a great game player at the expense of relationships and family if you're a woman.  The statistics don't lie - nor does the past 93 years since women got the vote.  Women are still outnumbered, but now they are more educated, better team players and better business builders.  But they don't rule the power seats.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was an awesome Heart felt book i love reading books about love. I usually don't read books with sad endings but this sad ending had a twist you didn't expect. I just wanna say AWESOME BOOK
B009ME47H2|5.0|The audio recordings are very high quality. I've used the app to record my guitar, voice, mandolin and octave mandolin. The default settings for the SAMPLE rate are fine, but the FREE app does let you change them. I set it to CD Quality so I could take the wav file and run it through a midi converter to produce sheet music. The recordings are stored in the EasyVoiceRecorder folder on the internal SD, so it was easy to copy from the Kindle to my PC. One word of advice: If you rename the recording in the app's playback option, they may not show up when you connect to a PC. You can still email them even if your PC can't see them.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|This has been a life saver, what with it being compatible with a lot of image editing programs, but it's Will display 11 files named 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 as ,1,10,11,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. I just wanna know if this happens to anybody else and if I can get them to be organized properly numerically and alphabetically.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|My Aunt recommended this book to me and I am so very glad that I read it.  It was heartwarming.  I could picture in my mind the entire events as the book progressed.  It kept me wanting to read more.  I didn't want to put the book down.  From front to back it was so interesting!!!  I will recommend it to every book reader that I know.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|As I write this I struggle to remember the movie, maybe that is the problem.<br />I was entertained, but it did not leave a lasting impression.  Maybe I need to re-watch.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is good at working your brain in ways you might not always use it.  I enjoyed it and for the coins I got from kindle for free I didn't even have to pay for it.  Well worth it!
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Very nice scripted and the actor where on point. It's a fun, I don't give a crap what I'm watching as long as it's good kind of movie
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is great. I really enjoy games that exercise my brain and this did! Only drawback and reason I didn't give 5 stars is lack of levels. Need more!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Enjoyed the trip through he US version of Da Vinci Code.. I was a little tired of the repeated info every other chapter ad i hit chapters 100++..
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I play it every single day its the best game in the world to me 0 problems i mean me and my friends play it all the time its an awesome I LOVE IT!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I completed this one with my daughter on our fun weekend. We wish it was longer but I would definitely get the next installment!!! Hope you come up with it soon!!!!!!
B005HED11Y|5.0|i like having star trek available anytime i can access my amazon account.  having all star treks makes this even more nice.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The game is fun but it is not for all ages.  It is difficult to control.  It jumps when you want to slide and slide when you want to turn.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|I have to echo other reviewers - the main storyline in &#34;Redshirts&#34; is OK, but not great.  The first coda is also OK, the 2nd coda is very good and the third coda is excellent.  It's almost like these parts were written by a different writer.  I only wish that the rest of the book was of the same quality - but the character insight that made the last two codas great is almost entirely absent from the first 250 pages of the book.
0316044695|5.0|I have read this book and recommended it to all who will listen. I feel this and his second book SERVICE should be mandatory reading by all high school seniors.
B00BWU0S3Q|3.0|A violent crime drama with lots of action. Plot was  predictable. The ensemble acting was good. A good role for Josh Brolin.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I realize that a lot of people didn't like this book.  Maybe she was just trying to get through it so she could be done.  But I still didn't think it was bad, not nearly as bad as a lot of the other reviewers would lead you to believe.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|Good for a quick scan if ur not too concerned with quality. Handy for posting a quick pic that has been taken old school style.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I can play this game for hours! The graphics are amazing love the movies and the game. Not too fond of the aquatic part just yet I'm getting there.
0679722610|5.0|One of the first novels of the \\"hard-boiled\\" genre, in which an investigator, usually a private eye, a loner, hardened by experience, acts straddling the margin of the law to solve a case. Of course, when a reader of our time first approaches a book like this, one thinks it's full of cliches and commonplace, until one realizes that it's here where they were created, to be further copied to satiety and taken to film down to self-parody.<br /><br />A detective with the Continental Agency, known only as the \\"Continental Op\\", has been summoned to the small mining city of Personville (otherwise known as \\"Poisonville\\") by one Dan Willsson. But before he has the chance to meet the guy, Willsson is murdered. Without even knowing what the mission would have been, if eventually he had landed a contract, the Op focuses on solving the murder, which he quickly does. But so it happens that Willsson was the son of Elihu, the decrepit owner of the town. This Elihu seems to have lost control over his gangsters, who are now fighting each other for power. Taking advantage of the old man's confusion, the Op coaxes him into a contract with the objective of getting rid of the gang, during which the Op causes a bloody war. At the center of the intrigue is the seductive (but alcoholic, careless and greedy) femme fatale Dinah Brand. Her most recent conquest is a gangster with a speech disability which only allows him to speak in whispers, who is waging a particular war with the Chief of Police. The internecine fight soon escalates to a chaotic level, and amid the blood-spilling the Op must now, first and foremost, try to get out alive while figuring out if he himself has committed murder.<br /><br />Yes, a twisted and manic plot, told with short, dry sentences full of witty bravado, in a town where cynicism, corruption, and avarice are kings. The novel has the virtue of being believable and coherent throughout the mess, including the necessary turns of the screw which keep readers at the edge of the seat (but whiskey-in-hand). Genre and style are a perfect match, and every cliche is enjoyable in its full originality.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|This film is flawless, really well made and excellent acting. Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner were excellent. The plot and script were excellent.
0451532082|5.0|This book is a must for all your daughters and also Mothers if you have not already read it. Its a beautiful story of a loving family with impeccable values that all parents want to impart to their daughters. The author has woven a gently flowing story of the pains and pleasures of a normal simple family with four sisters and their parents who bring up the family nurturing great values and love for each other. All four girls have a personality of their own but share their stories, successes and fall backs drawing the moral support and strength from each other as they face each situation in life as they grow from childhood to little women. This is a true timeless classic with wonderful use of language and thought that can in fact be used by schools as a text book that can both grow the thoughts and values of both the young readers and the teachers.
B0039208CG|1.0|Batman's most infamous villain...Jerry Bruckheimer!<br /><br />He brought this series to an all time low, this film started it all. First of all, Jim Carrey's Riddler performance was okay, a tad here and there overly done but overall, I'd give it a B-<br /><br />Chris O'Donnell as Robin, good but not quite great as well, C+<br /><br />Val Kilmer as Batman, I think he did a good job as Batman, not better than Keaton's performances but not that bad also, B-<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, an F-!<br /><br />The movie itself, a D-, really bad script and feel. The costumes were even worse except for Robin.<br /><br />Honorable mention, Drew Barrymore & Debi Mazar.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was soooo enthralled by the first book in this series and was excited to read the second. But the second was slower to get through. This book was just as intriguing as the first. Some of the plots you see coming and then there are a few twists. All in all a great book, and great series.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Besides Batman & Superman, DC's characters are very hard to develop into movies. These movies bomb most of the time, Green Lantern had hope but alas, failed. Maybe it was Ryan Reynolds, maybe it was the costume, Sinestro was okay but the acting could have been better. All in all, this film really was stagnant and dissappointing.
B007SGM084|5.0|I wasn't sure if I wanted to read these books based on what I've here...but, it was worth it.<br /><br />Must read!
B00C2ISGP4|1.0|The steelbook was really bad, does not close well and packaging was sub-par to bad. The movie itself is okay, Travolta is at his best when being a villain but it could have been interesting to have seen Cage as a villain, good film all in all, bad steelbook.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|There were a lot of different characters but you never forgot the main ones.  The story had a good ending.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|I bought the CD for Kelly Clarkson and was pleased to find that there were other artists who also produced some beautiful music.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book is not a 'feel good, cosy up next to the fire' kind of book, it is real. And it has been a while since I read something real. I wish I could say that I cried while reading this book, but sadly I didn't. I really wanted to cry, to cry at the sad moments, and the moments when you think to yourself, \\"wow, that it what strength is...\\". I enjoyed this book, it was in a way, a wake up call to remind me, \\"oh yeah, there isn't always a happy ever after\\". I would not recommend this book to anyone under middle school age, because these kids are going through cancer, and some parts could be pretty hard to read, and if you try to skip those parts you will be disappointed, because the worst of them had caught me off guard. I would recommend this book to anyone age appropriate though, something worth a shot at even if you may not be interested in the type of book. This book did wonders for me, it changed my perspective, (which is pretty hard to do) and I was rather impressed with these characters. I am glad I tried something new. I hope that if you do decide to try it you enjoy it as much a I did.
1416550550|2.0|did not care for this one.  Better than House at Riverton, but still too slow moving and shallow.  Didn't like the way it jumps around constantly from time-period to time-period.  I could have told this entire story in about a dozen pages.  No plans to read additional titles by this author.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|with someone so outstanding, in her opinion, would end a kindergarden teacher living with her mother seemed sad and unfulfilled

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is just awesome! it is like temple run,  but 100% better!  there's good graphics and sound effects. the minions look adorable and makes the funniest of sounds. the upgrades are pretty good but you shouldn't waste you're coins on revivals unless its pretty important.  there will be battles death and fun! the only bad things : I had difficulty starting up the game and some goals I cant pass unless I have a facebook account with friends who has the same game.
B003TNM2K6|5.0|The reactions of ordinary people to such a terrifying situation are believable and not too over the top.  A great short story is transformed into a great film with a memorable ending.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|Cate Blanchett is the all-time best actress in the role of the young Queen Elizabeth - outstanding performance, and she looks the part.<br />As director, Shekar Kapur gives us a very interesting interpretation of the young queen's surviving a staggering maze of hazards, attaining and holding the throne, and establishing herself as a real queen, wielding actual power on her own, not as some man's property.<br />There is a symmetry between the opening scene, with the Protestant martyrs' heads being shaved to prepare them for being burned at the stake; and the last scenes, with Elizabeth having her girlish long locks shaved off and replaced by a wig, worn with white-face makeup, to show how she had sacrificed her girlhood and &#34;weaker sex&#34; emotionality to become the remote, iconic Queen, now beyond all ordinary human concerns.
1250004217|5.0|Sarah's Key is a wonderful book.  The story is riveting and the reader learns a bit about one of the more unknown and unsavory parts of WWII.
B0061US58C|3.0|This review is not a reflection of the quality of service as it is the quality of the movie. Streaming was good, HD was not all that great, but the movie was average, to say the least. Watched it with my daughter and she almost fell asleep. It seemed more geared towards an adult audience and lacked the great storyline that the first on had. The &#34;spy&#34; twist was a little bit cliché, over the top for kids, and the characters lacked development. That is just my take. I could be wrong!
0062231375|5.0|This book is brutally honest, hilarious, and crude. Its relatable for foodies and probably one of the only books to give a true look into how hard the culinary world is. Buy this book!
B008BU75IQ|2.0|No conclusion, forcing you to buy the next book (a quadlogy?) even tho the 3rd in the trilogy wasn't very good
0470474874|3.0|That just might be my fault. I thought it would have exercises to do to help teach me excel but it don't. It is to be used like a reference tool.
0140177396|5.0|This is required reading for my daughter who is heading into 9th grade.  She was surprised at how much she likes it.  I'm thrilled that the classics are returning to schools and I applaud the teacher who selected this gem.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I enjoyed every darn page turning account in this book. Not at all what I expected from an apocalyptic genre novel. The writing style is quite unlike anything I've experienced before, piecing together difficult concepts in digestible, entertaining pieces of humanity.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Love the way he writes. Grips you from the very first page to the end. Can read him all day long.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The game itself is great and fun to play on, but half the time it won't open, it gets sooooo annoying!
1400052181|5.0|We picked this book for our book club and did not regret it!  Loved that it is based on facts but, as they say, truth is stranger than fiction.  It's good for those looking to learn about a real person who's cells, unbeknownst to Henrietta and her family, changed so much in the medical field. However, this is not so much for those looking for a racy story/book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well written description of life and relationships in Afghanistan. Keeping characters' relationships straight could get a little difficult but all in all a great read.
B00B8WXEXO|5.0|Great album.  Pressure and Time is great too - get them both, kick the friends and family out and turn it up.  You will not be disappointed.  OK, maybe your neighbors will be bummed, but then they may want to come over once they hear this album
B00005JMYI|5.0|My husband thinks this is one of the funniest movies ever so I had to get it for him. He is very pleased.
B007O3BIIY|5.0|These guys are just what I needed - real soulful rock n roll.  I have Head Down as well.  Both GREAT albums, both getting lots of playtime.  Can't wait to see them live.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The actors, the writing, the scandals...this show is so much fun.  You quickly care about the main characters and what they're going through.  Great season!
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Good stuff for any fan of rock music. The bonus features are neat too, with a look into the recording of the soundtrack.
B00499QUK2|5.0|The best ----actors are superb. Story lines are enticing.  Background scenery is interesting.  Fun to watch.  Who could ask for more.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Love this movie. The cast is excellent, and it's very well acted. Of course, it's Tarantino, so there is the over-the-top violence, searing tension, and quirky soundtrack that I love. Highly recommend.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|Great story. Crime/mystery based supernatural horror. Ethan hawk is a great actor/director. Some cgi a little cheesy. But over a good thrill ride of a movie that keeps you guessing. Not going to win any awards but in a world filled with so many sub-par horrors this one stands above the others.
0812993845|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has written another wonderful novel.  With two characters just as likeable as Becky Bloomwood in the Shopoholic series this book is a great read!!!
B001EYK54W|4.0|It was nice to see Steve McQueen in a different type of role.  It was a creative adventure and left you wondering what the ending would be. I enjoyed it!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Wife loves the books and I love watching the series. She's been trying to get me to read the books but I never have time. One day I will read them though!
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Well, I read this book pretty much because I had read her other books which were mostly well written.  The one word that describes the book is \\"engaging\\".  Certain aspects of the book resonates so well with me that I felt it was written with me in my mind.<br /><br />That aside, the books combines the different views/perspectives on race, ethnicity and identity in a very easy to follow script.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I bought these for my wife who got completely hooked to the first book. Now she's been begging me to read too. Unfortunately I don't have much time for reading books, I'll have to get the audio book version eventually.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game, it's very realistic and interactive. I have a feeling I'll like it more once I buy some coins though!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Downloaded on a whim but now I am totally addicted.  Through level 10 in just a couple hours.  Looking forward to level 11.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Please give your customers a choice.  The old app was great and took less space to install.  I just bought a new Android device.  This was the first app I installed and I was appalled at the new look.  I blamed google app store at first, but no.  You guys did it to yourself.  Please offer the old app as an option.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Very challenging, addiction game. Had a hard time putting it down. Love it. Wish there were levels to this game. To me only draw back.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book was an interesting read and showed insight to a situation no parent would want to endure. It was an entertaining read, but not as gripping as i would have expected.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I hate trends, fads etc. and that's exactly what I felt this series was when it released--- but It was such an amazing read. All 3 books in 2 weeks. I couldn't put them down. I loved the characters too much!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is a very fun game and the update is finally here it is a great use of time
B00080Z53O|5.0|Really enjoyed this  film . The actors were great. Found myself really caught up in the film.  Really poignant and heart warming.  Will surely watch it again .
0451228731|5.0|wonderful, engaging, extraordinary book.  I was desperately seeking a new book to read. Started the 2nd \\"name of the wind\\" book.  Lame. tedious. repetitious.  Started world war z.  also uninspired.  disconnected narrative left me feeling bored and uninterested.  Am i just too particular?  Started this.  woah! YES!  this was what i was looking for.  Fascinating treatise on the digital connectivity of our world.  about the permeability between the virtual and physical worlds.  Like dystopian sci-fi that's realistic, frightening, and just too plausible to make you feel at ease in our digital world?  about an \\"evil\\" daemon.. . or is it?  Lot of ambiguity. lot of complication.  Hard to decipher true motivations of characters.  are \\"evil\\" people actually working for the greater good?  No easy answers.  Personally, i would rewrite the ending to be less of an adrenaline rush smash'em up etc. etc., but it didn't spoil the rest of the book.  highly recommended!
B00821PCJS|2.0|The story dragged out too much.  I had the impression the movie/story was trying to track a Stephen King novel and fell desperately short.
B00001NTXN|5.0|easy to play, kids enjoy it, don't have to put a lot of thought into game so it is fun or you can really think about it and make it tough
0920668364|5.0|This is a hard covered book and it arrived safely. Thank you! This is a wonderful story for all ages.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is such a great story of family and a father's undeniable love for a child he simply can not see for who he really is. I thought this book was an excellent example of love story/ murder mystery. I recommend it highly.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|Kind of boring! But well done nonetheless. I was hoping for a Downton Abbey soapyness that just wasn't there. I'd watch it again but not pay super close attention to it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game but it only has 10 levels but hopefully they will get more!! I love to play this in my free time its very challenging
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely obsessed with Downton and this season did not disappoint. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll seriously reconsider whether or not you were born in the right era. And then you'll cry again.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|Saying that Zodiac is David Fincher's masterpiece is a tough statment to make only because almost everything David Fincher does is innovative, fresh and thrilling but Zodiac is a powerful example of what happens when a brilliant director, actors and script come together. It's like the perfect storm. For one thing it's exceptionally beautiful to look at. Cinamotographer Harris Savides captures the terror of San Francisco during this era with washed out often cold looking images. And Fincher produces a film that feels like something that came out of the 70s, it's a throw back film all the way. There are no huge action sequences, there are no explosions just simple storytelling and effective filming techniques. Fincher got lucky with his cast too. Jake Gyllenhaal give an exceptionally good and restrained performance of a man falling down an obsessive rabbit hole. As always Robert Downey Jr. is the real standout as Paul Avery, Zodiac shows that even though most people know him for Iron Man now, Downey is still one of the greatest actors of his generation. A special mention should go to Mark Ruffalo who plays the lead detective on the Zodiac case. He's a man who once inspired Steve McQueen in Bullit, but as time goes on we see a man tired and at a loss on a case that he just cant understand. Zodiac is an utterly stunning film.
0525478817|5.0|So I am not going to write a novel about how awesome this book is John Green already did that. :) But this is the best book I have read in many years, it is funny, happy, and sad what more do you want from a book. P.S. I couldn't put it down stayed up till about 4am reading it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|lags a little on both of my devices... but otherwise amazing!<br />Amzing graphics, great detail, and awesome plot of the minion story line!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Nothing more annoying than reading a book with spelling/grammatical errors.  This happened throughout the 6 books, and at times even the names of the characters were wrong way around and I had to reread the section to work out who I was reading about!  Otherwise storyline is good, a little wishy washy but still enjoyed the set.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of sound with it simply mounted on top of the camera. Easy to use.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Read it. Watch it. Know it. Love it. Think about it. Become addicted to it like me! Can't wait for season 4!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a very fun game...my entire family enjoys the game. its really addicting too, it makes you wanna keep playing.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The Anker Dual Car Charger worked exactly as advertised for my iPhone 5. (I cannot speak to how it would perform for Androids, but assume it would work fine for them as well.) The charger has two USB ports, one with the correct amp output for charging an iPhone and the other with the correct amp output for charging Android phones, all from your vehicle's cigarette lighter socket. (Apple itself sells a different brand of third-party car-charger, but I spoke at length with an Apple Care rep and he confirmed that the specs listed for the Anker charger's iPhone port were the correct specs for the iPhone.)<br /><br /> On a recent 3-day road trip, I wanted to have the use of my iPhone 5 on a pretty much constant basis, and when its battery ran low, the Anker car charger had it locked and loaded again in no time! (And I could use my phone while it was charging, with no  slowing of charge time that I could detect.) I've seen the ads for other products like it, and they may be fine, but I have personally researched, and now used, the Anker charger and I know I can trust it. Whenever I leave home now, I must have 5 or 6 things with me: my billfold, my keys, my water, sunglasses on a sunny day, my iPhone, and now the Anker Dual Car Charger. It really is a \\"don't leave home without it\\" item!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|y'all need to try it! I had a lot of fun with this app everyone should get it! have fun playing this app!
B0013D8LCW|2.0|I didn't recall having seen this video but I wish that I had . This effort called Surfer should have been called &#34; Trials and Tribulations ;. I find the comparison with &#34; Latter Day&#34; silly . This is &#34;poor me&#34; effort isn't even in the same class as<br /><br />This video has been compaired with Latter Days. There is no comparison as far as I'm able to comprehend . What a sad tale of a young surfer wanna-be and entrapment in a home enviorment of a drunken father a sister with an overactive libido and a nephew seeking a father figure amongst all these worn out situations . This a badly acted and I wish I had been sheltered from it.<br /><br />l
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is the best app I ever bought for my Kindle Fire all year. I LOVE that I can make videos and take pictures on the same app. It's definitely worth buying.
0671867369|5.0|I first read the parts that correlated with the DVD's....worked well..I believe it is better to read the book before watching the videos..
B004DLPXAO|5.0|like the clarity; the font choices; syncs well; handy...can take with me rather than my laptop.<br />would pass on to my visually impaired friends.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is an excellent writer. I was reading on an flight and I laughted so hard that tears were<br />rolliing down my cheeks. The lady next to me wanted to know what I was drinking?!!

B008K8VDPU|5.0|my daughter likes to ply piano and she is really enjoying this app, simple to use , great work in developing this app.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a really fun game and i played it non-stop with my nephew as soon as we got it. But now it seems like it glitches when ever i play it and freezes my Kindle.. now it refuses to open. But otherwise i loved this app!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Time killer. Good for the brain. Keeps your mind moving forward. Must get to take time away. If you know how to play get this app. Have fun.
B008XGW1CI|4.0|JK Rowling's A Casual Vacancy is a compelling novel that deals with the tension between the smug inhabitants of a postcard-perfect little English town, and the marginalised, welfare-dependent and often criminal people who live in the neighbouring public housing estate.<br /><br />The book begins with the town councillor who crossed  this economic and social divide in part because he went to the town's school.  He has maintained an uneasy peace in the municipal border wars, which shatters into deviousness and skullduggery as people take sides in an election to fill the \\"casual vacancy\\" caused by his death.  (Hardly a spoiler: he dies on page 4.)<br /><br />A Casual Vacancy is more specifically located in English society than the Harry Potter stories, which may confuse North American readers who are not familiar with British notions of social and economic class.  However, people who read British mystery and crime novels, or who watch the occasional British TV show will have little difficulty.  This is a socially conscious novel that makes us uncomfortable, whether we are British or not, because the characters, their motivation and the situations in which they interact are familiar.<br /><br />The plot is character driven; Rowling's understanding of people and her skill in presenting them will have readers empathising with her characters, even -- perhaps especially -- when they are not people who you would want as neighbours.<br /><br />The adult townsfolk are flawed human beings motivated by their desire to maintain (and possibly improve) their places within their exclusive little world.  Their machinations are counterpointed against the lives of teenagers from both the town and the tract housing close by who rebel against their parents, whose sexual and social transgressions make them easy targets for juvenile revenge.  Both the adults and teenagers derive pleasure from the misfortune of others, creating a dangerous mix of interlinked feuding that is reminiscent of some  British murder mysteries.<br /><br />It will come as no surprise to Rowling fans that the teenagers are especially convincing.  Unlike the characters of the Harry Potter novels, they have no magic, no idealised school with fascinating teachers who care for them, and no heroic destiny to save the world from an evil genius.  This is not the wondrous alternative world Rowling shaped out of medieval myths and magic.  Here is no Hogwarts with its profligate riot of marvellous beasts, larger than life characters and cheerful flaunting of natural law.  Instead, the characters in A Casual Vacancy have to cope with the everyday, gritty life in which Rowling herself lived until her imagination lifted her into well-deserved fame and fortune.<br /><br />People the world over love to revisit Harry's world where courage, hope and loyalty are bound to prevail.  Harry Potter has an indomitable spirit in the face of adversity, in part because of his parents' love. He is luckier than the characters in A Casual Vacancy.  The novel captures the way young people strive to overcome the consequences of their parents' stupidity, cupidity and selfishness in the deeply flawed society in which we all live.  Like Harry, they are bloodied but unbowed.ome  British murder mysteries.<br /><br />It will come as no surprise to Rowling fans that the teenagers are especially convincing.

B005H9B2CE|5.0|Great story line, and eye candy helps me get through boring rainy days for sure.. 5 more words required lol
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have always liked Nelson DeMille books, but I think he was paid by the word for this one. And Corey's humor gets old. But I will still look for and read his books.
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|I was REALLY enjoying this game until I came across a glitch. Just wonderful. The rotating fans do not work. The ships crash into them. Super annoying. Please fix because this game was really fun/addicting.
B008B68IUY|5.0|I've seen many Barbie cars in my day.  As a collector and huge fan of all things Monster High, this Scaris Convertible doesn't disappoint!  Like Draculaura's car that was released back with the Sweet 1600 line, this car is a little lighter than your traditional Barbie car and made entirely of plastic.  It's purple and black exterior is decked out in super cool cutouts.<br /><br />While it is a very light car, it looks like it will take a lot of play before breaking.  That is helped by the fact that it doesn't have open/shut doors and is essentially one piece.  The tires spin fine.  No problems with them whatsoever.<br /><br />I am enjoying this Scaris Convertible.  It is great for playtime, as well as photo ops!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is lots of fun you can buy your own minions with the bananas you collect and complete missions but when you first go in to the game it takes a while to load though but watching the minions run around is so cute I love the little minions so cute
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Picked this up when Amazon had it really cheap again, so I upgraded from my DVDs.  Picture and sound are excellent, although they did not blow me away.  Or perhaps I am more accustomed to bluray now.<br />The movies are classic of course.  Even Crystal Skull is pretty good.<br /><br />This is one franchise that should never get a reboot or a remake.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is so much fun and it's so fluffy! It is free which also makes the game ten times better than it is.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Started out ok, but then it starts repeating over and over. Too much of a not so good thing.  The movie played out better.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A great story for all ages. A love story without the mush. It is mild science fiction. Difficult to stop reading it.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|its a good game and it passes time by it gets tire ing. and it takes a wile to earn a lot of mony unless you pay real mony and to get cars and other stuff it takes the mony you earn in the game
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the best Solitaire app I have seen. Its easy to get started,  keeps good stats,  and even encourages when I win. It never locks up. Great app.
B000UZNRS2|4.0|Another fast read.  Constant action and good characters.  I did scan some descriptive  paragraphs to get to the final point.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh loved it I need two more tricky hats But I cant get em GRRRR I'm anger but it was a good game I royalty loved this is such an addicting game I could play it over and over again!!!!!!
6305949972|5.0|Came great with prime.<br /><br />As described. No external damage and everything was in working condition. I think I might buy another one.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Very pleased with the performance vs cost of this mouse.  I have large hands and it fits and feels great when I'm gaming for extended periods of time.  Overall I'm very happy and satisfied with every aspect of this purchase.  I would highly recommend this product with no reservation.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Interestingly futuristic and an enjoyable read. I love sci-fi books, and I really liked the mix of fiction and realistic events.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!! you need this game you can play with your friends!!!!!!<br />It's really fun get this game now!!#!#!##
0596805527|5.0|I took a recent JavaScript course from SitePoint and the instructor recommended this book. It is great and very in depth for serious JavaScript developers. My instructor called this book his JavaScript Bible and I agree with him. Awesome.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|For those reviewers who said that there isn't a way to lose, look in the top right-hand corner. It says, \\"Play by Score\\", right? Hit that and you CAN lose if you run out of moves. In fact, on that option it is rather hard to win :P<br />This is a relaxing and wonderful FAOTD! Beautiful background choices and lots of them, tons of different shapes, relaxing music, shuffle button, (yay!) hint button (with penalty) AND pause button. (Whew!) Yet it all manages to fit without looking cluttered. LOVE to play this! I may have found a new favorite app :P Peace out, peeps! P.S. GET THIS APP!!! EDIT: I wanted to add to my review! Not only are there all the features mentioned above, but there's also a wonderfully attentive developer! Thank you so much Pozirk games!!! You listen to your reviewers and are patient with everyone! You're the greatest!!! :D
B000PMLFRA|3.0|This had to be the one where George Lucas went back and 'remastered'. Its rather aggravating, annoying and distracting to see all the additional useless garbage added to the movies.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I have so much fun remembering where I was and what I was doing during the time of these songs.
B00AW57L96|4.0|It kept me there from the beginning to the end. I loved the way the author wove her story around and through the characters. Spellbinding.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this is a game u can never get bored of best game since subway surfers.<br />I like this game it is just way to much fun for one person.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I was looking for a workout video that would challenge me, but not be impossible. I have tried some insanity workouts with my husband before and it was just not for me, but this video by Jillian Michaels was perfect for me. I read a lot of reviews on many workout videos and decided to buy this one and I am glad that I did. I was looking to tone up and get in better shape and it did just that. I am on my last week and can noticeably see a difference from when I started. I really like the fact that the workouts are only 20 minutes long. I feel that getting in better shape with this video has pushed me to work even harder at getting in shape by running daily. Overall I would recommend this video to people who are looking to tighten and tone in a short amount of time.
B004Q9T4E4|4.0|Niall tells the story in an engaging manner. The narrative is lively and understandable and even if you disagree with some of his opinions you are happy to read on......

B00005N6KG|5.0|Bought these for a family member for a Christmas gift and she loves them! I tried them out and the sound quality is great for this product.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Redshirts is based on the premise that there really is life in the universe that's going along and doing all the things explorers do.  Think Galaxy Quest and how there are folks who know the ship as reality and those who know the television show is a construct.  John Scalzi does a great job of creating a story in which the characters (fictional and 'real') interact, are believable and sprinkles the whole thing with humor.<br />Great read!
B00BESM14U|1.0|I've tried to rent this three times. Every other amazon instant movie I try to rent works. My account had enough money in it and my settings were fine. Why is this screwed up?
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I'm not yet sure if I should've bought this game. I love games like this, but they always make me feel less smart than I am. However, I will keep playing it, and maybe I'll become brighter.<br />This game really makes you pay attention. My suggestion is look closely at everything.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This was a nice trip into the past when times were more carefree.  The characters were endearing and became like family.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I am a huge Neil Gaiman Fan,but this was much too short, and the story was just O.K.<br />It seemed like a short story.
B000I8JEY2|1.0|Finally gave up and watched something else because there was so much yelling and idiocy I kept having to put it on mute. Wasn't interested in a silent film.
B001AW156U|4.0|Being a long time xbox player this package had made playing my new ps3 controller tolerable, almost enjoyable. I received product before it said I would receive which is a rarity due to the small town I live it.<br /><br />First, you don't get this package however. You get a little ziplock baggy containing the two triggers and two thunbpad grips. The all attach within seconds and after some getting used to the extra bulkiness of the triggers it'll be very comfortable. I love them!<br /><br />The only bad thing. The bottom of the triggers were very sharp and while theres no way it could have broke skin it was highly uncomfortable. I took my wife's nail file however and seconds later it was a comfortable roundness. This is the only reason this product doesn't get five stars from me and if given the opportunity I would have given it a 4.5.<br /><br />These are a steal! Buy the!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE IT! ITS A MIXTURE OF SUBWAY SURFERS AND TEMPLE RUN! YOU SHOULD GET IT I RECOMMEND IT TO YOU!!!!! :D :P
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My old cable was not separate to the charger and I noticed it got very warm. I gather it just gave out the new one works fine.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is a well put together Majong series of puzzles.  I felt challenged but not overwhelmed. Very nice assortment of  figures.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My Grandkids LOVE this movie. They will ask to watch it over and over.<br />Even Papa is walking around repeating lines from it.
159463176X|5.0|I started with the Kite runner and kept looking for Hosseini's coming book. Great author captivating story. Waiting for his next book.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|always loved the series and finish by sanderson - my grandchildren also love these books - reread by all of us at least fifty times all of books in series
B000UBMWG4|5.0|A real gem of science fiction, must-have in your video library. I never get tired of seeing this film with none other than Harrison Ford.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Sade is always a great, owning this cd and dvd will provide hours of beautiful time for me to escape from this crazy world. :-)  Sade keep making them and i will keep buying them.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Downloaded 13M app...then it installed and downloaded another 30M....then downloaded again.<br />It went thru the tutorial, and yes the graphics seem pretty nice, but as I was doing this it crashed. I got a dark screen and it took some time before I was able to reboot. I had to remove it from memory and then delete it. YMMV.<br />BTW...this was the FIRST app to crash my kindle fire since I've had it, well over a year.
B00006JKOM|5.0|This was the music I grew up on and have this album on vinyl but cannot find the CD version in stores.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 there are a lot of new things on this game. the graphics are really good too. the only thing that would make me like it even more is if they add more characters. rather than that I wouldn't change a thing.
B00005JKG9|5.0|I am in sales and this is a movie that many sales managers and sales coaches have quoted.  It is good to add it to my collection.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|My favorite song on here is stand by me. I met Grandpa Elliott in New Orleans in 2010. He seranaded my friend from Gulfport whom I was visiting at the time. Have it all on video to enjoy! When I play this CD, I play Stand By Me over and over. It is a terrific arrangement of the song. It also comes with the video. Great deal.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a very good book or Dictionary it teaches you a lot because it is a great way to learn about the words and phrases related to the public language.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|In fifty shades of words I loved all three books..very much!  Also seems like every one is trying to do some type of 50 shades of stories.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The season finale broke my heart but I do love this show. It is in another class from all the trash that is on TV. The historical representations woven throughout the episodes is very nicely done. I love this show!
B0042J6VUS|2.0|The Tri pod stand is very good and stable but the holder of the camera has no way to secure tightly the camera. And when you press the shutter release the camera moves and this destroys the whole purpose.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey makes it real easy to type on my GSIII. Predictive typing is spot on, alternate characters are there - very rarely do I have to switch to the second keyboard screen.<br /><br />I also use it with 2 languages, and the transition is seamless (American English and French Canadian). The app will build it's own dictionary based on what you type. Very handy!<br /><br />Now, please : don't mess it up by adding too many features! Keep it simple!
B00B2166BS|5.0|This cable charges my Nexus 10 a lot faster than the usb charger!! It was a great buy. good stuff
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I was hooked from early on by the writing and insights about human behavior and spirituality. I avoided reading this because of all the hype about the book and the movie but some people I really respect suggested it completely unsolicited. It gets four stars instead of five because of one section of the book that seems completely contrived but not enough to make me stop reading or dissuade my overall enjoyment of the book. Definitely and entertaining and diverting read.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|love this CD forever and more! Adele is a great artist and she is very talented! I wished all her songs are like this... this is prob her best album yet!
0715338153|5.0|I saw my coleagues works and they are beautiful.<br />I pretend to use the ideas to decorate my grand dauhters' s rooms.<br />Tone is fantastic in creating romantic dolls and pets.
B006M4RN3U|2.0|It is my fault for not researching this cd first before buying it, but I purchased it for my 11 year old daughter for her birthday since she really likes the songs on the radio. Unfortunately, there are a few songs with some really bad language in it, so I did not let her have the cd. It is too bad that some songs are ruined by the choice of words that are used.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|As usual, Joe Bonamassa never ceases to amaze me.  What awesome talent! The Vienna Opera House provides great acoustics for this latest release.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|I bought this for my 11 year old daughter for her birthday. She likes it, but it is pretty challenging for her. My 14 year old nephew tried it, and it seemed like it may be more appropriate for closer to his age.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush is so much fun I love it. It is a great app and I know every one of all ages will enjoy it.
B0041OOEJY|5.0|Took a different direction from the original, and was its own movie. I thought Jaden Smith nailed it, and of course Jackie Chan was as entertaining as he always is.
034580404X|3.0|The story was good, a little redundant with all of the sex but I guess that was the point. I was disappointed it the quality of the paperback books themselves they are flimsy and tear easily
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen is one of my favorite writers and the character of Lizzy is one of literature s most beloved heroines. A classic!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I was half expecting to be let down by this book. There was so much build up and anticipation thanks to all of the previous books that I didn't think there was any way that Kaleb's story would live up to the expectation. I am SO glad that I was wrong. It was perfect.
B002NEFL8W|4.0|I would say that I LOVE this grip, if it didn't have a distinct skunk odor to it when I took it out of the box. I don't remember my camera smelling anything like this when I bought it a couple of months ago.<br /><br />As for the grip itself:<br /><br />it is super easy to install<br />adds a nice weight to the 7d<br />ergonomic shape for shooting portraits<br /><br />Overall, I am glad that I purchased this, but was concerned about the odor! I am hoping it fades quickly!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The title says it all. I love games that challenge my mind and this game definitely does. I cant wait for the other levels to be available.
B00CFA222M|5.0|it was panned by critics, but I loved it. movies like this are my nut.  I love the special effects!!!
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I loved this movie for it's heart and humor!  Jennifer Lawrence is a revelation as Tiffany, and I couldn't help but fall in love with her character in this movie.  It was surprisingly funny and charming!  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone!
B008JFUR10|5.0|Pacific Rim 3D Review<br /><br />Pacific Rim pays homage to the classic Godzilla movies of the past, but also steps up the excitement with three to four intensive Mech versus massive beast battles with spectacular special effects, colossal scale and tremendous urban decimation.<br /><br />3D Review:<br />Pacific Rim's 3D utilizes a large portion of 3D computer generated graphics, with humans converted into 3D from a 2D source, combined seamlessly into one incredible 3D experience. The 3D in Pacific Rim is powerful in all the ways a 3D fan could hope for. There is thrilling pop out, depth and dimensions of characters, objects and backgrounds, with lots of particles filling the foreground such as raindrops, water or sparks. The presentation of 3D in Pacific Rim is phenomenal.<br />3D: 5/5. Comparable to the best in 3D cinema.<br /><br />Like Del Toro's previous successes, Pacific Rim's characters, story, special effects and frenetic action shine forth thanks to his unique presentation. If you're looking for incredibly massive battles that decimate buildings and create engulfing tidal waves with every impact, backed by a worthy plot, look no further than Pacific Rim.
B008VIKLWA|5.0|Its very good. i have a grandaughter that loves animals so she loves watching this and it is on her level but i enjoy it too!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a must get app. you will have fun for hours. its a great app for you and the kids. GET THIS APP!!!
B007SGM084|1.0|Ugh. Couldn't make it through the 1st book. i read ALOT of romance and some of it can be very racey. Not sure why this book got such coverage when I thought the writing was very basic. Honestly, i've read alot better and way before this book hit the market.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really liked this game.  It was kind of short but sweet just the same.  Oh, and btw, creepy voices in the background - yeah I looked around a few times.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Similar to Gaiman's &#34;The Graveyard Book&#34; in that it is quirky, yet leaves you with a feeling that all is right with the world. I loved it, but I think it would also be a fun read for teens.
B0091Q82L8|4.0|First, if you're not a die hard Who fan, buy their best album, Live at Leeds.  If you are a Who fan, chances are you love Live at Leeds, and you know every intricacy of it.<br /><br />Live at Hull was recorded the day after Live at Leeds; it's virtually the same set, but the Live at Leeds recording is technically better with fewer flaws.  Indeed, the liner notes say the recordist for Hull forgot to record the bass for the first six tracks and had to dub in the bass from the Live at Leeds set.  There are several mysterious \\"clicks\\" caused by the recordist plugging and unplugging jacks, as well as by Keith Moon hitting his microphone with his drumsticks by mistake.<br /><br />The purpose of owning this CD is to hear the slight variations in the performances of the songs, solos, and between song banter in a set recorded just 24 hours after Live at Leeds.  Some elements of the same chaos are virtually identical to Live and Leeds, but the occasional solo tangent or jam is slightly different.  For a fan, that's fun.  For everyone else, just get Live at Leeds.<br /><br />I say bring out all the Who live curiosities!
6305428042|5.0|I grew up watching this movie and when I moved out I had to buy my own copy so I could make sure I didn't go a single Halloween without watching it. this movie is so funny, its one of my favorite movies ever. definitely best Halloween movie ever and one of the best holiday movies ever
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game takes the room escape series to the next level. The graphics are much better than the other games, and the 3D aspect adds a little more challenge. The hints also make the game more accessible.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This Cd has not left my CD player. I bought it on iTunes and bought the hard copy. They are that good. Concert was even better. Can't wait for next cd. They have so much more music if you did for it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I liked the first book of the trilogy, even though I hated the ending because it wasn't really one.  So I continued with the second book, hoping to have closure but not hoping for it to be so good.  I was happily surprised; you get to know the characters better, it gets a little more emotional, and it makes you want to find out what's going to happen next.  I really liked it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I hate this whole new setup!!!!! I never right harsh reviews... but seriously it kinda sucks! go back to the way it used to be!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its great because the minions are adorable and anyone can play this game and any age so you are never too old
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved watching this through Amazon Prime.  It streamed flawlessly through my Roku box. Entertaining, and it is nice that Amazon makes it available.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game and so do the kids. freezes up from time to time on my kindle though.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I'm using with Autodesk Inventor 2013. This product lives up to my expectations.  Excellent quality. Real Good to use with CAD
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|this book was great, full of valuable insights. i recommend it to anybody seeking personal freedom (who isnt...) i look forwaed to reading the 5th agreement
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|Terrible movie - giving it away Many scenes were too dark couldn't tell what was going on and we don't like reading a different<br />language at the bottom - sometimes flashed by so fast we didn't even see what it said -<br />Bad movie for Bruce Willis
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It is an amazing book, it had a little too much sex, but overall it is a great romance!<br /><br />-My public name
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|I was excited to get this DVD...but at several times, it just stopped or skipped.  I ended up returning it.  From what I did see of the DVD, I was really disappointed.  It was no where near the quality of the production; nor at the level of Phantom.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and just challenging to keep your attention :) I would like to see more levels and I would actually pay for this app
B000KKPN5C|4.0|If you're looking to add a little flexibility to your flash photography this is a great option. It's compatible with nearly every Nikon camera and does a great job with fill flash as well as bounce flash. It has no manual controls what so ever. You can only \\"adjust\\" flash intensity through the camera body. The only control on the back is the power switch.<br /><br />If all you're looking to do is add flash capability to a pro body, a body with a broken built in flash or a film camera this is a great option for you.<br /><br />If you want to get creative with your flash in any way i.e. wireless triggers, manual exposure settings etc I would recommend you look elsewhere.<br /><br />There are plenty of other flashes out there that will provide you with all the essential functions of a hot shoe mounted flash for less money than that of a branded (Nikon, Canon etc) with maybe just a few exceptions.<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B00BBWNOJK Yongnuo YN-560 III Speedlite Flash for Canon & Nikon - GN58 - Built in 2.4Ghz trigger/transceiver with full support for RF602/603 triggers.]] will do everything you need with the exception of iTTL metering. This can actually help you learn about how to properly use flashes and adjust their output to suit your shot's overall feel and theme. Not to mention it has a whole host of other features not even found in Nikon flashes twice the price!<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B001ZT3DOU Vivitar Digital TTL Auto-Focus Flash for Nikon - Black (DF383NIK)]] will do everything the SB400 will and more for about the same money. It may not be a Nikon, but at least you've got the ability to customize the shot now.<br /><br />Overall, the SB400 is a perfectly capable unit, but, in the long run, I wish I had just done a bit more research before I purchased this one. It's great, but only for a finite spectrum of use.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I loved the maze runner series, and this book was an amazing finish. I liked how they ended this one, I won't say anything because that will spoil it and this is definitely not a book that you'd want to know the end of right away. Just save a little money and buy the trilogy, it's a fantastic series!
B003YCI1O8|5.0|The fact that it's in digitial high high def is great.<br />If you haven't seen the movie shame on you, buy it now.<br />Kevin Bacon and friends are trapped in a small town by huge underground critter destroying buildings and eating people.<br /><br />Fun flick.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Fantastic superhero film with humorous one-liners/scenes sprinkled throughout to make this action film fun, without being silly or stupid. Iron Man, Capt. America, Thor, The Hulk, etc. each get their time in the spotlight, with the numerous characters working together in the film, without overwhelming it and making things confusing.<br /><br />Overall, a good, exciting family action film that sets the stage for a good sequel! :)
B0088NPFPQ|5.0|I love all four of these movies, I think I've seen each at least a dozen times, and the first and second probably close to thirty times.<br /><br />As buddy cop movies go, it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />The blu-ray is clear, crisp and smooth.
B005L38QK2|1.0|i got sick of buttons randomly ceasing to function during gameplay, so i went to the SteelSeries website and updated my software, hoping that would help.  BIG MISTAKE.  Now it sits on my desk blinking at me and nothing happens no matter which USB port i plug it into.  Yes, Mike S.,  i read all the responses with the link to how to fix the problem. Maybe it would even work, IF I HAD A PC, but i have a mac.  Now how do i fix it?
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The problem with video services and TV is you can never get ALL the movies in a series at any given time. The more movies, the harder it is to get them. Now a HP marathon is pretty easy.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there's too much nonsense before you get to the movies.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is a great app to help discover the names of songs while they are playing on the radio. Easy to download and install.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|What a great game for only 16 cards. Lots of surprises and fun are packed into this little package. Two thumbs up!
B004B4J7H8|5.0|This was added to my collection of movie sound tracks. I really enjoy this one! The music is dark like the movie, and flows well from track to track. I listed to this often when working or reading.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|Before I begin, I just want to say that I don't think Todd is Geoff.  BUT Geoff isn't Todd either.  And as much as I loved Geoff's voice in the past (I can always play old CDs and hear him), I think Todd does an incredible job; not only sounding eerily like Geoff at times (voice and phrasing), but more importantly, like himself and making these songs his own.<br /><br />When I listen to Queensryche's self-titled CD, I hear exactly what I've been missing since HITNF.  I proudly love that album and I don't mind that it was stripped down.  It took me two years to get into Q2K and now I only listen to 3 songs (How Could I?, Liquid Sky, Right Side of My Mind) from it.  I actually wrote a review for Tribe giving it 4 stars, but honestly, I only listen to 1 song (Blood) regularly and would give it lower stars now.  OM:II, AS, DTC, and FU have no rotation in my playlist at all.  So for me, Q2K started the decline and I wouldn't necessarily say it was the departure of Chris, though he is missed (more than Geoff).  I'm not really here to review those albums, but think it's important for me to state I really thought I'd have to give up on one of my favorite bands - and not to be overly dramatic, but one that saved my life with PL.<br /><br />I was truly bummed when I heard about the troubles of the band, and I'm not going to go into those details, but was excited to know that they were attempting to capture their `lost' sound and record this CD.  A few years ago I actually remember myself thinking that I wanted Wilton to `grow some' and start writing again because he wrote a lot of their earlier stuff - and lo' and behold - he did.  What I really think was great, and actually read some reviews bashing this (don't understand that), was that already written material by Mike and Scott was not used.  Instead, they allowed all band members to write songs and I think that's important because not only do we get to capture the old sound, but we are introduced to Parker's and Todd's writing potential and what they have to offer.  These new songs shine by giving us samples of the Warning, RFO, OM, Empire, and PL sounds.  It's all there - you just have to listen and you can hear flashes of the past.<br /><br />When I grade a CD, I have two simple requirements:  can I lip synch the cr*p out of it and can I air-drum with the best of them?  I can do both and with gusto.  Though I feel Todd captures my attention with his voice, Scott and Eddie shine - I don't think I've heard Eddie so clearly and Scott pounding so emphatically in years.  The guitars are in the background for me instead of front and center and that's ok because I really enjoy listening to the bass and drums again.  I read the reviews regarding the sound quality and I don't `hear' what they're talking about - NOT to say it doesn't exist - but that maybe I don't know what to listen for.  When I did listen with my headphones, though, I heard some of the static that was mentioned.<br /><br />Now in saying all the good, does this CD stand up to RFO, OM, Empire, or PL?  Well, not quite, BUT it's so much better than anything they've done in years and once I quit hitting replay on my player (might be a few months), I know at least 4 songs that will go into my heavy rotation playlist (WDGTD, Spore, In This Light, and Open Road) and they will fit in perfectly with those older songs.  If I had to state a weak song, I'd say it would be Vindication, though I honestly enjoy the entire album.<br /><br />As far as the length of the album, I don't mind that it's so short.  Yes, I obviously want more, but it's a fitting re-introduction, not only for the fans, but also for the new members.  Now, they can now progress in their musical direction like they used to do, but they had to get us back first...to reel us in...to recapture what's been missing so they could move forward again.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|It's a nice movie to watch and if you are looking for a low price Blu ray under $10 bucks then it's good to have it in the collection.The blu ray version has extras which gives in sight on how special effect of the movie was done.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great there are many thing to watch out for  and there is lots of things that you can collect and unlock new things to help you as you play.
B00003CXMG|4.0|Jason Lee and Kate Hudson lead the way in a hilarious movie about a rock bands rise to fame and fortune.
B006S039YU|5.0|Cute and funny! A must see for all ages!  My 3 yr old adored mulan and the dragon!  Watch out for the &#34;cow&#34;.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Probably the best book I've read in years. I couldn't put it down after just the first chapter!  As soon as you think you figured it all out, Flynn throws another twist.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|By far one of the very best Disney movie yet!  This is a movie I don't mind watching again and again.
B00005QCYD|5.0|The DVD was in great condition.  The film, exciting, and special effects, great as ever.  But more than that, the actors and choice of actors couldn't have been better.  I do wish Michael Jeter had had a bigger role.  He's was an under-rated, GREAT actor, and could have done more great things.  The film was better, in my opinion, than the second Jurassic Park film.  But how can you go wrong with the great Sam Neill and William H. Macy?
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Always been a favorite here. Had a great movie night with my 4yo. Streaming at home is a great option with little people
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is better than temple run 2!!! Love the costumes also! This game is AWESOME!!!!!!!!! You people should get it who do not have it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Now that the new update came out i got so excited when i saw buckets and here is a tip u can still play multiplayer without a mojang account by going on the same wifi and go to your worlds your friends world should pop up
0307352153|5.0|This book is very well researched and documented, yet easy to read.  I saw myself in many of Cain's examples and was able to empathize with how other introverts deal with uncomfortable situations.  I have purchased three copies of this book to give to my children who have young children of their own and are involved in the field of education.
B00AVASSZ8|4.0|Great vocals. I just recently heard of Mr James I was watching VH1 soul and saw him I enjoy his music and if you like jazz vocals this CD is a must for you collection.
0451232852|5.0|Bestseller for a reason!  Book Club suggestion but loved Pillars of the Earth. Strong, deep characters, well-developed story and overall intriguing.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is so good. Edge of your seat good. Love the character development. Very suspenseful. Intelligently written. i want more.
B004G5Z0AU|1.0|Unable to view the first disc and didn't want to skip to the second and third.  Second and third would play but not first.
145210655X|5.0|I saw this book and I had to have it. It is absolutely adorable. Some parts made me laugh. I'm thinking about buying more as gifts.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What an amazing story of heroism, defeat and courage. May god bless all service men and women who defend our country each and every day.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I'm a social psychologist and this movie immediately reminded me of some of Goffman's work on mental patients. Truly an insightful movie!
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Great re-issue! Been waiting for a long time for this since ive only seen an old beat up VHS version of the concert. I always wanted to dub that to a CD so the addition of the live CD to accompany the DVD & original album made this a no-brainer of a purchase. A \\"must have\\" for any & all Alice in Chains/grunge/alternative music fans!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I'm hoping there is another volume in this series coming out soon.  I've read the first three, but the third one ended in a cliff hanger so I'm hoping there is a fourth volume in the works.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Fun! I love puzzles and I can make them with lots of pieces and make it easy for my grandson.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun way to pass the time! It is hard enough to be a challenge but not so hard that you give up or can't figure it out.  Can't wait for more levels!!!  I will be keeping this game on my Kindle
B00138EV8U|5.0|What kind of a review should anybody possibly have to put up for this?!! =) It's like alllll wonderful, classic, greatest, &#34;make you wanna move&#34; music EV-ER!  To sum it up &#34;Buy it&#34;! Have a great day! ;)
B001EAWMGA|5.0|The script was a little shallow, but I like Jim Caviezel as an actor whether it's his TV character or in &#34;Passion of the Christ!&#34;
B00CWV9FQA|3.0|It good, but I feel as though they could have spent a little more time and money developing new scenes if they were going to charge full price for the movie. Kids loved it so I guess thats all that matters.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I wasn't as disappointed in this book as others have stated. I actually enjoyed it and thought Day left it open for the next one, I am looking forward for the next one...hurry up!
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Loved them when I was 20 and now still love them at age 50.  Timeless.  Takes me back a few years and puts me in a nice mellow mood.....now all i need is a little smoke to recreate the whole package.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked how the author explained his experiences in words you can relate to. The author &#34;opens your eyes&#34; here on earth and gives hope to those less fortunate in spirit.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Loved it I play it all day. It's worth the time<br />It has a mix of temple run and subway surfers except it has a really cool minion twist to it.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Very funny and engaging book to read. Could not put it down once I started. Occasionally felt the 'blogging' part was sometimes too long but overall, a must read!!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|As a huge fan of TED Talks, I really like the fact that I can access them at any time on my iPhone.
1565847032|3.0|Noam's view of the world is uniquely suited for a liberal-leftist audience.  Thease are valuable because Chomsky is a &#34;liberal thought-leader.&#34;
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|this dictionary is great when looking up words and nit having to be online to search for them. it is great to use offline and no need to worry about downloading additional material.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Rick Riordian amazes again with his Percy/Jason series. I cant wait to start reading \\"The mark of Athena\\"! Amazing series!
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I was a bit disappointed with this game because you need to have it linked to you facebook account in order to challenge friends. the problem is the account linking, which makes it difficult that you are the only one with the game and none of our friends have it. Boring.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My.daughters were assigned this novel for summer reading before entering college in the fall. Curiosity got the better of me,and having logged 25 years as a middle school English teacher,reading a YA book was right up my alley. TFIOS has so many themes to explore, I Could make a wonderful unit using this book as a springboard for discussion. Overall, I found this book to be appropriate for its YA audience. I did have a problem with the author character attending Gus' funeral and then surprising Hazel in the minivan. It seemed a little far fetched and too convenient to  move the story along to its end. Other than that,, I enjoyed reading TFIOS  and I'm sure others will, took.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|i love this game and got it once it was available for the Kindle Fire. it has many levels to beat and unlock vehicles and levels. never gets boring.
B0093ST4KM|5.0|first, I have to say was great (the shipping, the timing, and the all experience. The movie is a great culinary comedy, I show it to my students at school and they all love it.<br />Robert.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I'm a big sudoku fan, and this app has a great variety of puzzles to play with a lot of difficult modes on it. It is truly entertaining.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I still havnt GOT all of them completed,  but try every night on them. I told some of my senior friends and they like it also.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love despicable me, especially the minions. this game is so good and easy to play with collecting bananas, completing missions, and challenging friends. I really love it, but the only downside of it the constant downloading of game content to play, is the only bad part of it. Overall is great and entertaining.
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|I really didn't understand the game. I guess being a senior it takes longer to learn. I gave up on it.  But I Well try others
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Didn't think that this book would suck me in the way it did. Must read. Can't wait to start the next book in the series!
B00004XQP4|5.0|I have most everything from Green Day but had not heard of this album before so I thought I would give it a try. First listen, I thought &#34;this is a pretty good album.&#34; Second listen, I thought &#34;this is a really good album.&#34; Third listen, I thought &#34;this is a great album.&#34; Now the disc has not been out of the CD player for a week. As usual, the tempo is upbeat, with great melodies and lyrics. Highly recommended.
B00CZF87TY|5.0|I personally didn't care much for the 1st movie so the thought of sitting through the 2nd movie was definitely something I wasn't interested in doing.......But I must admit that I am so glad I did see it. In my opinion the 2nd movie is better then the 1st one. The music was perfect for the movie. Pharrell Williams did a great job, my favorite song is &#34;Just a Cloud Away.&#34; This movie is well worth seeing.
B002CSC5EC|4.0|I love this movie, the music is great, the quality of the film production is good and the sound quality is good. It comes with an extra disc of bonus materials that is really great. I wish a copy of the full sets by The Who, TYA, and Hendrix was available.
0307476073|3.0|I enjoyed \\"Wild\\" by Cheryl Strayed and found it an easy, yet long read.  The most unexpected aspect of finishing the book about Strayed's hike along the Pacific Crest Trail, was that after I'd finished the book, I felt like I'd said goodbye to a close friend whom I had been meeting for coffee each day to hear about her latest adventure. I missed hearing about all of the near disasters, the lost toenails, the wonderfully generous people and horribly scary creeps she encountered on the trail and in the small towns, how she survived for days, at times, with just pennies in her pocket.<br /><br />The bits about her heroin use were disturbing.  I kept looking at her author photo, and thinking, really? Hoping she was now clean of that drug. I liked how she skillfully weaved the loss of her mother story in with her PCT quest for self-healing.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone looking for inspiration to help them change their lives.<br /><br />Marie Estorge<br />Author of CONFESSIONS OF A BI-POLAR MARDI GRAS QUEEN<br />and STORKBITES: A MEMOIR
B008DVJMAW|4.0|I saw this recommended on That Metal Show and decided to give it try. It was advertised a southern rock a la Skynyrd, with good melodies and lyrics. Basically, I agree with the description but Skynyrd is a bit heavier whereas this band is more pure country. Still, it's a very listenable album and probably will grow on me.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Not enthralled with this or the hype.  I take the point of view with a grain of salt & don't let the Hollywood spin affect me on a large scale.  The movie was fine for a rental.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|I got the 2 cd set, AND the MP3 for like 12 bucks.  Cheaper than the MP3 by itself at that time.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I know these movies will hold my attention & the big screen makes it worth seeing in a theatre.  Had to watch this one at home because of circumstances when in the theatre.  Hope they keep on making Bond movies.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Awesome, awesome, awesome movie.  My 16 yr. old and I saw this in the movies, and then had to buy it.  Great coming of age story.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Better story very believable. Best bad guy in the business. I will miss M. Can't wait for the next one. I like heroes who kill, fight and have sex like Bond. Forget the Lone Ranger.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 8 yr old takes riding lessons but does not have a horse.  This app provides her with a little something to fill in that gap.  It has great features like, feeding a certain amount and the ability to take pictures of &#34;your&#34; horse.  The only thing I don't like is how you need to pay to get more options for the horses' colors, etc.  But that is the way of these games, right?
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|I really enjoyed this game when I played it for the first time last night. It is very simple while still having enough depth to make it fun. Once everyone knows how to play (and it's super easy to teach) it goes pretty quick. Each turn is just draw one play one so as long as people are paying attention it goes really smoothly.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I came late to listening to this band, but am now in love!  Would love to see them in concert, and I am NOT a concert type person.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Yeah, this product is expensive for what you're paying, but it's worth it - there aren't any other adapters that provide equivalent functionality at this price point unless you invest in a gigabit USB adapter.<br /><br />This thing is built like a tank. Would highly recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's really entertaining for when you have nothing to do. I really like it. I've only just got it so the levels are pretty easy, I hope they don't get too hard. Lol.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You are always surprised by twists and turns taken in the story lines.  Although the last episode is a heart breaker!<br />You can't go wrong watching this series.  Maggie Smith is glorious!
1111130345|4.0|Most books of this type I usually just use as a reference.  I'm actually reading this one from the beginning and doing all the exercises.  Have enjoyed using it along side the course I'm currently taking.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is absolutely wonderful. The actors and storyline are perfect.  You even learn about England's history through the shows. ADDICTIVE!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|what a great album.  probably the best of 2013.  Am very impressed and cannot believe there are soooo many great songs.  CD has been playing non stop in my car for couple of weeks and still not bored with it.
B0055S348W|5.0|Hooked up just perfectly to my printers on my network.  No problems at all.  Glad it was made available.  Perfect for my office work.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it takes time but its fun. I like to just kill time before bed. its free so don't complain people!
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|I havent watched all of the movie yet, but what I have seen is enough.  Well, done Michael Moore.  For a country as rich as USA, if one doesnt have private health insurance and get sick, there is big trouble unless one can pay.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I could never play the game because it takes up too much space. If you are reading this, take this warning &amp; DON'T get this.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|While there are certainly some good beats and hooks wrapped into this disc, it was a much more intelligent than I expected, and has quite a few &#34;slow&#34; songs.  There is quite a bit of transparency in the writing, though it is interestingly abstracted.  Overall I found this much more emotional than I expected after hearing the current top 40 hit, and I appreciated the mature artistry.
B00AEBB9SM|5.0|came in good condition and this movie is definitely worth the buy. Also the prices was awesome for the quality of the movie.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought the box-set as a gift for a close friend of mine and he absolutely loved it. The set is great to give to someone who is familiar with the series whether they have read the books or not and it can still be an appropriate gift for someone who is not so familiar with them. It's also a great way to introduce someone to the Harry Potter world.
1781162646|5.0|Loving this new Stephen King book already and i'm barely into it. Book also came in perfect condition. So very happy with this purchase.
B009A882D0|5.0|I had forgotten how many hits these boys had. It is outstanding road trip music. Watch the speed limit, you may break through the sound barrier and go back to the 60's!
B001EC2IXK|5.0|I've seen thousands of movies over the years, and few have stuck with me like this one. A person could go their whole life through without realizing what a genius actor Paul Newman was, but this film will stand forever as a tour-de-force of acting. Aimless defiance and bittersweet rebellion are the only dialogue Luke is interested in having with the prison world he finds himself in, and each piece of personal victory narrows his choices dramatically until he is left with nothing but the coolest hand of all. A performance for the ages.<br /><br />Everyone involved with this film was a perfect choice, and the commentary on the deluxe disc is very informative.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I wish that I had read all of the horrible reviews for this app! It keeps saying that I don't have enough space on my Kindle Fire although I have checked over-and-over to confirm that I do. The app won't install and I can't delete it... so it's holding my entire hard drive hostage! When I went to the reviews to see if this is common, I found that about 1/4 of the reviews are from infuriated Kindle Fire owners like me! I used to love playing Magic and this was going to be a fun way to play in a contemporary format, but I'll probably have to erase all info from my Fire to save it!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|LOVE this game.Have been able to accrue slot of chips so I sometimes can sit and play for hours at a time. Best game around.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|David Spade and Patrick Warburton--two of our all time favorites. This is a video we watch again and again and laugh every time.
B005HED11Y|5.0|This show was way before my time however, I really enjoy it.  It is cheaper to upgrade to an Amazon Prime account and stream ALL the Star Trek seasons than to buy all the seasons on Blu-Ray.
034580404X|4.0|The first book was a lot of sex. It got boring. You can only plod through so much of it. I was relieved, reading the second book, that it explored the issues Christian had and how he tried to deal with them. The last book with all the drama with her boss was silly but I`m glad it had a happy ending.
B008578PMU|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies. It's good from start to finish with action all the way threw. The dog fights and planes used in the movie are right on target with World War II air combat.<br />Any way I loved the movie and would even order this cd to add to a collection if that was my thing...
B008YRVW0I|4.0|This is a fun game with the matching, buying decorations, fish and improvements. My one complaint is that there are only 3 tanks to create. So I am now in the position of only found the matching as all 3 of my tanks are full and I can only fit so much stuff (including fish) before things start to look crowded. I would give this 5 stars if I had more tank options as I have no incentive to keep matching. Right now I have over $50,000 in the &quot;bank&quot; but nothing to spend it on since all my tanks are full.<br />I have Royal Envoy by Playrix and the full version seems to have a lot more challenge and unlimited play. Right now I am around level 200 with no end in sight for fun and challenge.
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|It was never sent to my device or installed. I sent it several times, I review all the files, nothing.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Watched the series and go  me hooked on the book. Can't wait to finish the rest of the series.  Shortest book in series.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  Both the mother and daughter's stories kept my interest throughout the book.  I would very much recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a really cool way to waste time!!! Fun for all ages!!!! It is an AMAZING simulation game and shows how the responsibilities of an animal are not to be taken lightly!! Definitely for moms wanting to explain this to there children!!!
0470901071|5.0|Very helpful for the CCNA! Lammle does a very good job explaining things. The provided review questions really lock in the material.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it except for that everything cost slot but I'm glad I got it if you ever have rode a horse and liked it or want to you'll love if
B009UX2YAC|5.0|They should create world tours like Chicago, Harrisburg Pennsylvania, and San Diego California. And people , people it's an inspector not Santa Claus!!!!!!
B00AB7IA1S|4.0|This game is fun at first. However, after the 10th level it got a bit boring. Then I got the lift fan. It entertained me for a bit, then again it got boring. On the 3rd set of levels, I they introduced Whirlwinds.  On 3.7, they introduced Whirl Fans. However,they glitched and I could not continue. I add on as soon as they fix that glitch.<br /><br />If that glitch wasn't there, it would be a good game overall.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I like games based on physics laws. This game was challenging and  a lot of fun! Nice graphic and sound also.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I know a lot of people weren't fans of this film, but I really enjoyed it.
B00C0UHGLO|2.0|The second to last level challenge cannot be done by the rules offered. Not cool....I really loved this game....And I can give a rip who's tracking me. If the challenge cannot be solved by the rules....it's not a game....it's a code breaker....not fair....was learning and enjoying up to that point...
B007THA4FI|4.0|This is quite a break from JK Rowlings usual Harry Potter novels. I liked this overall. I thought she really captured the small town atmospher
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|good clean fun with lovable characters. I downloaded this app because my son loved the movies. The game is just as much fun.
B00CI21EBC|5.0|One of the few albums you can listen to from beginning to end with out feeling the need to skip tracks.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is one of the finest games I've played in a long time. The ability truby ruby to fungi red red
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. It was a great read about social ineptitude and finding your place in life. Everyone is a little weird in their own way.
B00CATSONE|3.0|It's not very easy reading and it can get very boring at times.  I skipped through it in order to finish it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have enjoyed other electronic mahjong games but this one is much more fun. I particularly like the different tile arrangements which tend to keep the game interesting.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I was thoroughly impressed with the range of choices in this app but I eventually discovered I was viewing only part of the selection and that's when I was blown away! There is everything you can think of, everything you can't think of and even more!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Puzzles were fun and challenging, overall awesome game. Can't wait for more rooms. The music wasn't thinking music though, would like to have thinking music for it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book  was defiantly worth my money. The books keep getting better and  better. Can't wait for  the next one.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|If you are an introvert or don not like that label, but are a &#34;quiet&#34; person, this is an excellent book to read.  It will validate all the positive that is within you.  The extrovert, often much more talkative, is not necessarily the most effective.  The book is well researched, easy to read, and highly recommended to those interested in this subject.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|its a.cool game sorta like.sub way suffers but looker and funner but I don't like the characters. but ya its. cool ;)
B00009RDG9|5.0|This is a great movie, takes a little bit after US Marshalls which Tommy Lee Jones did way back when which is a great movie as well....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|something to do when there's nothing to do but hey you live 20 miles outran town and anything is fun lil.
0525953728|5.0|So much cool stuff in here! I still can't believe that this SEAL actually went ahead and published all the details. I actually first bought the book the week it came out, since I was afraid the Pentagon would try to ban it. Very engaging read and view into special ops world and operational pace. Highly recommend!
B009G78EE2|4.0|Wow...this has to be the first rap album I bought in years.  Of course I heard Thrift Shop and liked it, but Can't Hold Us was really what got me interested in this album.  I really like how he's a storyteller, and that to me is something that has been sorely missed.  Yeah it's cute that you have cars, houses, and big booty girls and whatnot, but what do you have to say beyond that?  Same Love is amazing, I love his lyrics and the chorus is sweet and catchy.  I'm very pleased with this album.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is really fun, the only problem is it lags a lot. But I can't take off for it lagging that's most likely my fault. Definitely 5 stars.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I was scared of monsters but this game made monsters like your friend so get this app I could not live with out this app
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Pretty slow beginning but picked quickly with details of the raid.  Great to understand what these folks go through which increased the already high level of respect I have for them.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|I loved Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in movie theaters as a kid.  I<br />love it even more as an adult on DVD.  Great commentary by the stars<br />Robert Redford and Paul Newman.  Also screenwriter, the legendary<br />William Goldman.  Buy this not only for the film but the accompanying<br />commentary.  Wow!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A nice follow up where book three left off.  One of my favorite stories which you never know who is safe.
B0055EDCGU|5.0|All I can say is wow! This record is one of the best I have ever heard! I love bands that can just go all over the place with there music and just kill it. Trivium delivers in every aspect of this. There heavy, there mellow, they kill solo's, scream, sing, just raw talent from every aspect of music. Is it there best album, maybe not, but damn, its hard to beat perfection. I mean ascendency and shogun, man thats hard to top. Trivium is the King and nobody will take them down from that podium!
B00280LYIC|4.0|This is a must have for any good sci-fi collection! And I must say that this is a rarity because I have enjoyed the movie (even though it is very different from the book) as much as I have enjoyed the book. I can't wait to start reading number two =0)
B003R50FRI|4.0|Was recommended this by the trainer at my local gym and was not disappointed.  Excellent read of a modern day true story.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app works great for kindle fire and is very fun. It is well worth the money I spent. This app updates New guns and is very accurate to the real world war two guns.
B00932A4XE|5.0|This was the funniest movie I've seen in a while and I have to say there were also those sad moments that made me cry.  As a recently new mom, this was a super funny movie to watch on a rainy day on vacation.  Fully enjoyed.
B009X01GJ2|3.0|this case looks nice and works ok but like most is still too expensive. cheaper case would probably work fine.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I knew it was going to be good but it was so much better...than I expected. Looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />Thanks Much!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|super fun. A lot more complex than 100 Floors, but not to hard that if makes you want to quit.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Takes up slot of storage but worth it. Be careful it is addictive and I guess a little bit epic.
B001VLXNO2|5.0|Vintage Jeffrey Archer. I enjoy each novel I read more than the previous one. What will I do one I have read them all?
B00ALM822K|5.0|Paper Towns is  a fantastic book, the depth of which surpasses most of the books I've read before. What does one wish they'd do if the shit really hit the fan? Margo boldly acts the heroine through her fun and enigmatic personality, taking the reader through a trip they'll wish they did themselves. The main character's development is astounding after one night, and you really understand the depth with which this was felt and understood by the two you thought you knew.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved every bit of it. It completely sucked me in, got me attached to the characters, and sad when it was over.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is truly a great game suitable for all ages. A MIX OF TEMPLE RUN AND SUBWAY SURFERS. You can change into to costumes which each helps you in different ways. Awesome job!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like the graphics and challenge of the puzzles. I like how you can change the background image and zoom in and out.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its so much fun nd its just like the famous subway surfers bt its more exciting. I can play this game all day long
0425264351|5.0|[[ASIN:B0095PNI32 Dawn's Revenge]]Lee Child's Jack Reacher is my kind of guy.  I wish I could live as spare a life as he lives, with a toothbrush, some cash, and an expired passport (maybe) and no suitcase. Jack is a huge ex marine who hitchhikes and walks. He is intensely ethical.  Killing floor, The Affair, and five or six other books I have read by him are inevitably gripping and hold me to the very last page.  Running Blind, my last read, kicked the ass of the FBI and their way of handling things, but kept the brotherhood of the USArmy and Marines as the good guys, except for a few bad guys in there.  I recommend Lee Child if you want to stay totally involved in a read.
B004MPESSY|1.0|I didn't think it possible, but the re-make is much worse than the original. The movie is only about ultimate revenge. The rapists are total scum, including the addition of the town sheriff. Just a poor excuse for blood, less nudity than the original, and a plot that would never play out the way it did. Kick me for renting it...now I feel like scum!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book was a game changer for me.  I had lost a lot of weight through tracking calories in an app on my phone, but I knew nothing about macros.  I also was doing too many reps and not really ever moving up on my weights.  I lost a lot of muscle along with the fat with the way I had been tracking calories.<br />I'm correcting that now that I've read Mike's book. I'm eating enough calories to put on some muscle mass, and I'm getting my macros right.  I'm also making some gains on lifting by going heavy for just 4-6 reps.  Mike tells you at the end of his book to email him with any questions, and he'd love to respond to you. He wasn't kidding, he's very helpful beyond the book. Be sure to follow the link at the end of the book to download the \\"Bonus Report\\" as well. It has some really great stuff!<br />You have to read almost the entire book before you finally get to the specific diet and exercise plans. There is some great information before that telling you why eating and lifting the way he recommends will get you in the shape you want to be, and there's a lot of references to scientific studies confirming it.  I recommend skipping ahead to the chapters where he lays out the diet and exercise programs, though. Get started ASAP, then start reading the book from the beginning as you're putting the plan into action. It's a really easy read and interesting stuff.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played but sometimes you just need some of the things out of the store to help you on your quest but overall it's great game you can purchase if you want to or not you can't earn gem an  stiff like the rest of games but it's still a great game I would recommend to everyone yo play
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season continues to make you feel like you are part of all the households and the last episode is a shocker......
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|this is a fun game to relax and enjoy ur day. it was great when i had my three kids finding the objects with me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The title says it all. Great game for free! Must have if you love Subway Surfed or Temple Run! Enjoy
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is the funest game its like racing it would be even more fun if u had some type of power up or to let people drive in the water
B005HSG3TC|5.0|My husband really liked his kindle fire and the case was good to protect the kindle from damage and it had support.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is very fun and amusing but i cohldnt name the . Horse.<br />Ok so its fun great fantastic its good
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read concerning this subject.  It is so well written and scientifically addressed.  I hope it helps skeptics come to at least consider the existence of God and an eternal life.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was well written and gave me a  peace about the afterlife. Some of it I did not understand because of the medical explantion but that does not make any differnce to me'' Since I am a Christian I know where I am going when I pass from this life. I was very sick with cancer for more than 2 years but I read several books about how people had experiences like this . It gives us comfort when we think we might not make it through. But Praise God I did and when it comes my time I shall go without fear.
B0092QITO2|4.0|We found this to be an enjoyable sci fi action movie.  It has a few plot holes, but the visuals are interesting
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this game.  Still trying to figure out the feathers but will eventually get there.  Great game to play
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Up to this point we have not been huge fans of the new batman series; but the latest installment left us wanting for more.  Now we can't wait to see Batman and Robin
B0063M22QO|4.0|I've tried many versions of mahjong and this one is nice. The graphics are pleasing. No annoying flashiness or gimmicks. Just straightforward mahjong with lots of options.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Daniel Craig is without a doubt my favorite Bond, making Skyfall another good movie in the bond franchise.  However, we preferred the darker, emotionally driven bond of Craig's first two films over the slightly lighter tone of this movie.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This is a fun, light movie that touches on the things that are important...and the silly things that annoy us about family.  I left the movie glad that I had watched it....and surprised at how much I liked it.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|This movie has some decent action, but the story was a bit lacking and the acting was frequently a bit wooden.
B008HK3XU4|1.0|The case does not fit my Kindle as stated. It is too big. Sleep/wake does not work either.<br /><br />I purchased this quickly to take my Kindle on vacation. I did not have time to return it for a better case, so I am using as protective case for my kindle in my carry-on bag. I take my Kindle out of the case to use it.<br /><br />I am disappointed that I spent so much for a protective case. At least the color (purple) is very nice.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have always been a fan of Josh Groban & have many of his CD's. He has a wonderful voice.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|We loved the movie! Action packed and Robert Downey Jr is always a delight as an actor. If you haven't seen this movie it is a definite must!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a fun and very addicting game I can play this for hours on end haha :) I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to have fun
B008OOYALE|4.0|fun game...many different activities...creative dragons...have met people from all over the  world ...be prepared  to spend at least some money
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|PRODUCTION: 6/8<br />VOCALS: 6/8<br />CONTENT: 8/8<br />ENJOYMENT: 6/8<br /><br />GRADE: B+<br />Nicely put together album with relevant tracks and a friendly appeal<br /><br />PROS<br />- nice concept and a nice collection of tracks<br />- solid and consistent production; a nice even atmosphere<br />- more than solid lyrical performances with introspective and on point flow<br /><br />CONS<br />- tracks are a bit soft
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Very Nice Book Love it. Looking forward for the rest of the books to be released soon. To know who won the War.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app! It's wonderful that it's free. I was gifted a nook, and have hardly picked it up since I have this on my phone.  I love having it in my pocket, I read for hours every day and have many books. Buy new ones ofte and the price can't be beat!  So, so many free to download and many others@.99. Seemingly endless supply and variety.  I recommend this app highly over any of the many I have tried, it is so simple and seamless. The one-click is awesome.  Be careful, It's addictive.  Once I start shopping I rack up $ fast, there is always another I see I want, and the price is always right. They use your reading history and have tons of recommendations in your genre right on your homepage to purchase without having to go to Amazon to hunt for more unless you want something else.  I love Amazon kindle.  Download and try, start with free s and you'll never go back to any other readers. ♥♥♥
B005K17RU0|5.0|Gave up on Weather Channel after their Kindle app became Micky Mouse! Should have switched to AccuWeather sooner! Tons more weather statistics than WC ever had.!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The first half of the book was very well written, the characters were three-dimensional, the prose fluid and the plot was cleverly laid out.  The ending, however (particularly the final quarter of the book) felt shallow and hasty.<br /><br />The initial structure of the plot was so well crafted that an anticipation was created for a stunning, intelligent ending.  This, however, was not the case.  Some readers may also have ethical issues with the way the ending was developed.
0385349831|5.0|I have read all of Paulo Coelho's books.  Some are not so good and lately they are mundane and simpley awful.<br />However, his earlier books were good, -- in fact, excellent.  I'm glad to see he is back on the right tract and while it was sort of along the lines of Gilbron, it was still excellent.  There are some excellent tips in this book to ponder and to put into practice in our daily lives.
B00C0W08XK|5.0|Very entertaining - some times too much. Get too engrossed in playing.Ha Ha. Need to pace myself.<br />It's easy to insert the numbers or delete if incorrect.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|It worked really well for a while, now it can barely get me through an entire video. Please fix this.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Just wish it would have had a little bit more characters in it. but other than that it was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game. super fun. I like the auto finish when you win. I would recommend this free game to all my friends.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game. I recommend this game,  It's a game for all ages. I love the little minions they are so cute.
B00002N9ER|5.0|These are great for keeping that errant MagLite from rolling around, getting lost. or falling on the floor. I have several sets!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The best movie game ever created well beside world war z it's fun it's great all and its just a great games for kids
B0092MKFIY|4.0|This is a great buy. I bought it specifically for three songs that I knew and already liked. I have since enjoyed listening to the whole album.
B009G78EE2|1.0|I dnt have this item I bought it a while ago but dnt have on my amazon music cloud if I could i would do zero star's cuz i bought it and only got conformation code but nothing
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love the little minions and it's a very funny movie! The online steaming was just OK quality when I use full screen mode (not HD).
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Love the album and the band and the case disc and packet were like new as promised, a recommended buy
B00BWJARHO|1.0|so sad that it is not at all as good as the LOTR first movies - hard to tell exactly why but feel like a cheap &#34;made for TV&#34; knock off- wanted to love it but it just fell short for me
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I like it. it's good times, even though i find the controls a bit clunky. I'm okay with that, though, because it's free.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I'm very happy with this DVD  it arrivivded in a reasonable time and was priced right Look forward to ordering again !
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|too predictable, just another shoot every thing in sight, wreck as many cars and buildings as possible.  A disappointing movie.  More talking and less action would help.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|i love this freaking show, man! Whoever thought it would be cool to follow the adventures of four grown nerds. I love watching that crazy ol' Sheldon Cooper. I can't imagine anyone that doesn't like him. One night I was channel surfing and it caught my eye when I saw Mayim Bialik was on the show. I was a fan of hers when she did the show, &#34;Blossom&#34;, come to find out she's extremely smart in real life, but nothing like her character on the show, I'm sure. I can go on and on, you should check this show out! It's a whole lot of fun!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|it works and I can follow people who I want and send things its great people know who I am and more its great
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Man, I love these dudes! Who ever thought you would look forward to tuning every week to witness the adventures of four nerdy men. It doesn't hurt to have eye candy like the beautiful Kaley Cuoco as your next door neighbor. After watching the first few episodes from season one I was instantly hooked! I am a fan for life!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|its awesome I love the game and the battles are my favorite it has all of my favorite character's and has the setting of the movie everyone should get this game!!!!
B000W91RUG|5.0|I have to admit, I didn't start watching this show until it has already went into syndication. My father fell in love with this show, and when I sometimes visit him, he'll watch the show while I'm there. After seeing the first few episodes from the first season I fell in love with it as well. Like anything else I like, I decided that I have to own these episodes on DVD!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is fun and it entertains me when I am board. It keeps me busy and I have fun.
B003L77G6A|5.0|What can I say, these guys are just freaking hilarious! I was hooked from the moment I tuned in to watch some episodes from the first season. Who knew it would be cool to try to keep up with a bunch of nerds, of course they do have a hot neighbor in Penny. You should definitely pick this one up!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My kids really enjoy the suspense at the end of this version of Annie. Carol Burnett's Mrs. Hannigan is a little tougher/rougher than in the Disney version, but my middle schoolers prefer this one. For younger viewers, I would recommend the Disney version where Kathy Bates plays Mrs. H.
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|If you're reading this, you're probably already a MGS fan. And if you're a MGS fan then you probably already have most of the content included in this collection. Still, that doesn't completely devalue this collection. I give it 4 stars because of the convenience of having all the games in one box. But I can't give it 5 stars because this is just an enhanced version of the HD Collection that came out just a few years ago. Konami is double dipping and abusing fan loyalty by offering us the Legacy Collection. The included extras are neat, but if you're not a die-hard collector then you probably won't care for them. The art book is small and simply includes photos of Playstation box art. They're all pictures we've seen a thousand times before lining the shelves of Gamestop. A major disappointment.<br /><br />I haven't viewed the digital graphic novels yet, but if you're a Metal Gear Solid fan then you already know the story. Another thing is that MGS1 is not included on disc. The game comes with a download code, completely eliminating the collection factor of this bundle (and if you already own MGS on PSN then the code is useless).<br /><br />With all that said, the Legacy Collection may still interest some people. If you were planning on getting the HD Collection then the Legacy Collection might (but probably won't) be a better choice for you. And if you're new to MGS then this collection is perfect, but odds are you'll probably just stick to Uncharted or COD or whatever you're playing. MGS is not a game you just pick up and play, so it's doubtful newcomers will find the Legacy Collection appealing. The only people who REALLY benefit from this collection are die hard collectors and those who haven't touched a Metal Gear Solid game since MGS3 on PS2 (I fall into the latter category).<br /><br />At the end of the day the Legacy Collection is just a repackaged HD Collection with some superfluous extras. Still, it includes almost every Metal Gear game to date and is stillloads of fun. I'm happy with it, but others might not be.<br /><br />EDIT: After viewing the first Digital Graphic Novel I have to say that this Collection actually may have some worth. The DGN is basically a comic book with voice acting. Again, if you've played the MGS games then the DGN won't add anything new for you in regards to the story, but as a fan I really enjoyed this cinematic representation of MGS. This alone doesn't make the Legacy Collection a smart purchase, but it does add some value and fun to the collection. (Although Grey Fox's new voice actor is terrible)
B001JIES4Q|5.0|This is a movie that I have watched many times and find a new reason to love it each time.  Am I a sap?  Yes.  So what.  Heart touching stories (other than Bill Nighy's character).
B000VBIGD6|5.0|this was a gift for my brother in law.  he loves it!!  the best xmas movie ever; great price too!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like Subway Surfers and Temple Run, this game is definitely for you! You novelist like you do in Subway Surfers, but when you get to a slide you have to move your Kindel. I love this game. It is fun and creative and the best part is you can change locations!!!<br />Gru's lab and residential area is really all you can run in, but you have battles with Vector and a little girl selling cookies. This game is totally worth the time if you ask me. You can dress up as different characters and competitive agents your friends for bandanas. I love this game. And the score bosters aren't hard at all. For example,<br />1. Beet one friends high score<br />2. Ride the unicorn 2 times<br />3. Upgrade the freeze Ray.<br />THIES ARE SIMPEL MISSIONS! :D<br />Honestly, I think this game is better then subway surfers. You will just have to see do  your self!<br />CLICK FREE AND INSTALL!!!!! You'll be happy you did! :)
0439023513|3.0|Was very disappointed with the conclusions of the story. I believe the author orushed to the conclusion to end the storyline. Could've been much better.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fantastic! I am addicted! Can't wait for more levels! If you havent played you are really missing out! Try it today!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'll start by saying I've never read a Stephen King book. Horror isn't my genre, so I've never really paid attention to him; however I am fascinated by the Kennedy assassination, so when I saw this book I had to read it. Let me say, it absolutely does not disappoint. King's attention to detail is amazing. Reading this book really is like stepping into the late 1950's-early 1960's. The way the story flows is impressive, considering it's almost 900 pages long, but it never feels like it's moving too slowly. It's a great book, I have been recommending it to everyone I know!
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|THIS BOOK MY SON PICK FOR  EVERYDAY READING<br />GOOD BOOK ....GOOD GOOD IS HELP AL THE WIMPY KID TO READ MORE
B008476HBM|5.0|A must have in everyone's book collection. The wonderful story of love and it's struggles in society and overcoming class.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Nesbo's characters are as finely drawn as those by Dickens, and a lot of the pleasure of reading his mysteries derives from them. Some might find his stories long on character development, but his approach suits me just fine. I suppose it would be possible to shorten this story, but doing so would make the ride to the end a lot less enjoyable. Love Harry Hole, Ellen, Rakel - everyone. Great bad guys.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Definitely just as suspenseful as the first one! More action by Lisander, the main character of the story with Mikhail.
B005V20JKI|1.0|Like many others have already said, the recent upgrade expects you to buy levels that were previously available. You let me play it, then you took away half the game and ask me to pay. Forget it. .
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Downloaded this game for my wife's tablet. We both played and enjoyed this game. The puzzles were<br />good, a little challenging.<br /> We cannot wait for more rooms to be added.
B005LTDPJI|5.0|This is an awesome boxed set.  Eleven complete albums plus bonus tracks with each album. If you don't already have these CDs this is the way to go. Great value.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love scribblenauts I have a few of their games. And then I found this! It is great I recommend it to all of you. Worth the 99&cent;. Like this comment if you love their games too!
0451239377|5.0|This book set the stage and paved the way for Follett, Ludlum, and so many other spy thrillers.  It is a book where you will literally not put it down.  I have read it three times and it is like a fine wine, it gets better with age.  I have told all of my friends, you have not read a spy thriller until you have read this book.  Simply the best.
B008X8P8A8|5.0|Great game. The gameplay is flawless, the graphics don't necessarily look like reality but more like a painting,and the multiplayer is awesome. This game is challenging at times, but not too much. It has a great story including a letter before each mission read by voice actors who sound the part. Absolutely best strategy game I have played on any tablet.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I was glued to the game but it would be great to purchase with bananas instead of coins even though i know that it helps pay and support the developers of the game... for me purchasing with bananas are more rewarding coz you have to earn them in order to buy in the shop
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book has something for everyone. The prose is incredible!! Thank you for writing this book. :) It will always stay with me.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It's a thrill ride from start to end, with great onscreen chemistry between all the principals.  Robert Downey's Iron man nearly steals it, but Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are top notch.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I've about worn out Quell &amp; Quell Reflect. I loved them and seeing what was planned for Momento was almost painful waiting. The colors! I didn't want to wait, then got busy moving (&amp; a new Kindle Fire HD) and was loading it up and got this awesome surprise!<br />The coloured lights and new things. I was in love again with Quell Momento! And this one speaks, with a tale and mini warnings. LOVE THIS BEST! Now what's in store for number FOUR?
B002T66IHC|5.0|Songs on Album bring back great memories.  Amazon's remastering of the album is really awesome - sounds great on 7 channel surround sound.  Thanks!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I almost stopped reading this book when I was maybe 1/3 of the way through. It started to drag a little for me - I think Stephen King can be a little wordy and too descriptive at times. It picked up shortly after that and I was engrossed in the story. It would have been a great loss for me if I had not finished the book.
B00DDUIW18|4.0|The book itself is great, however the kindle/ebook version does NOT include the Pearson practice exam software. The Amazon description does not point that out. (It gives same description for both ebook and print)
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|Very intense, raw sex and language but not as bad as some.  Excellant performances and interesting twists and turns. But dark and frightening in many ways.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|My wife and I are hooked on Dexter - we have spend many a night watching episode after episode until the wee hours of the morning.  I own Season one through five and plan to get the rest soon.
2839906171|5.0|Alex Osterwalder did a great job on this book. It gives an excellent view on how you can validate your new business idea on the business model concept, using the business model canvas.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|My wife and I are hooked on Dexter - we have spend many a night watching episode after episode until the wee hours of the morning.  I own Season one through five and plan to get the rest soon.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game requires some concentration; so you cant be thinking about a rough day or other things. its kind of an outlet!!
B004NS710C|5.0|Unstoppable was very exciting..it kept me on the edge of my seat...Washington and Pine had great chemistry.. very good movie.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|My daughter loved this book. It was a required Sumer reading for her. She is begging me to read it.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I really enjoyed the actual plot of this novel, but was shocked more than once at the sexual scenes and underlying tones that came about throughout the story.  There was only sex, no sense of love or connection, but even those scenes were not long or drawn out-- it just seemed there was not much leading up to it, then BAM! There it was.  It was also a very dark novel, that left me with an underlying &#34;humanity sucks&#34; type of feeling from every major character in it.  I like &#34;dark&#34; every now and then, but felt depressed after reading portions of it.  I may try another of her novels in the future, but I do hope others are a little lighter than this one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved it. We picked this book for our book club selection last month and my mind was blown by the plot twists. And I could not put this book down and was hooked from beginning to end. I will be reading other books by Gillian Flynn very soon. And the audible version was very good. I enjoyed the narration and you could feel the anger in Nick Dunne through the narration. LOVED IT.
B004VRL4BM|3.0|I thought I was ordering an NTSC Blu-ray, but it came in PAL format, and I had to return it.  Lost money on restocking fee, but no real complaints
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book was fine. I purchased it on my kindle and added the audible edition for a few bucks. I hated the narration on the audible book. The narrator didn't do a very good job being consistent with the Dutch/English accent for Lidewij Vliegenthart and I found my mind drifting away from her narration while listening. Do not bother with the audible version.<br />And like I said the overall review for the book- just an okay book.
0696019973|5.0|This book  is fantastic as a reference tool for making the 501 quilt blocks shown.  If you are a new quilter as I am, these patterns are priceless and will be useful to me for years to come.  Definitely a  keeper!
0316017930|5.0|I’ve gifted this book to at least 10 people.  I just can’t say enough nice things about the book or Malcolm Gladwell.  It’s a joy to have your perceptions realigned this late in life - but not easy.  Gladwell does an amazing job of making you reanalyze the way you think.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I have to say that this book was incredible!! One of the great reads of my lifetime!! If this was a book with no ending, I'd just be happy to keep going.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|Stick with this one. It's a revelation once you get used to the diary style of dialogue and start to really see into these characters. Wow! It blew my mind!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game will get you addicated..... HOWEVER, some levels I can't get thru, I have to ask my kids (lol), and I can't find any help on the what the &#34;lighting&#34; symbol on the screen does, or how to use it?
B004S5FW1U|5.0|I haven't seen the movie yet but thought to read the book based on some recommendations from friends. A heart felt story, likable characters, and moving themes. It helped me to understand mental illness better and feel empathy for people who suffer with this. Would definitely recommend this.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Okay so I have a borrowed Kindle fire and I love it but I don't have any musical instruments to play on it, now I do.<br />One of the main things I love about the iPad is the diversity of musical output.  But the Kindle is catching up checkout this program. Don't forget to drop the little plus signs around the notes you create that's your beat...
B0083Z614S|4.0|I had heard about this book and it appears on the top 200 list of the BBC so decided to give it a go. Beautifully written, and also though you don't like her so much, you feel such pity for her and her upbringing. The ending felt just a tad unfinished for my taste.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Or classic alarm sounds this one's kind of fun and when your sleep you don't see the ads so try it out it's free.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Couldn't put this sequel to The Selection,the ending really did surprise you and totally had your frustrated with Americas choices!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it. I like horses and I hate doing reviews and I have to be a contortionist the window of opportunity for God because she was with me off of the following a slot machines are a slot machines
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Neil Young is Neil Young.  Never a disappointment.  This album put all of his &#34;greatest&#34; hits in one place and I am enjoying it very much.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|It is very easy until level 10and then I run out of lives and have to wait for the lives
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|This is in reality a very well done British soap opera.  Nothing wrong with that when the results are this much fun to watch.  The cast does a fine job, with the possible exception of Elizabeth McGovern, who seems to be out of her depth here.  Maggie Smith stands out, as usual, and the writers have given her many of the best lines.  Truly she is a treasure.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Loved this book!! My friend had recommended that I read this book and loved it! It takes a while to get through the entire book, but it's worth it!
B001QL5MAA|4.0|I can't really think of another way to describe this book. It's well written, uses phrasing and language that is evocative and seemingly precisely accurate. It's creative in that it presents a universe alien to us, and the book presents it in a mostly believable way. The thing that makes this a four star rather than five is some of the anachronisms (which isn't the exact word) are so seemingly out of place. The book takes place a very long time from now, but a lot of the descriptions still use thugs I would think would be lost to time. &#34;The pounding of a phillipino drum&#34; or the &#34;discordant ringing of a Chinese opera&#34; not exact quotes, but descriptions like that. Things that make me go, &#34;how would they know what that sounded like a million years from now?&#34; The last 200 pages were read in a day. It's gripping and extremely interesting. The mystery of it all is intense from page 1.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome,I play with it almost every single day! The obstacles are cool and the my fav part of the game is that the characters are like AWESOME. On Facebook I  race people,I'm in 9th place on the high scores and I'm working up to it. So whoever that does not have  this game should GET IT.  : D
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Worked perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD. Thanks Fireproof games. Definitely worth it! Looking forward to your next adventure!! $1.99 is very affordable!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|My review is GOOD!!<br />The book is good THE definitions are good. I GUESS I love this song<br />So bye
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I used Swype in the past,  but this one is the best hands down and with themes it also looks quite good!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|The tone, pace and way concepts are shared are much to my liking in this book.  James certainly writes in a conversational way, that makes for a very easy read.  There are many great thoughts in the book James shares, but the two most powerful for me are:<br /><br />a.  The Daily Practice concept is solid and doing them can only make one better.  It is an awakening to having a discipline in some very simple ways that will \\"sharpen the saw\\" and allow a more fulfilled journey.<br /><br />b.  Idea Machine - to write-down ten ideas a day.  The brain is a muscle.  The more you use it, the more fit it becomes.  In this case, a more productive idea machine.  the practice of writing 10 ideas a day is challenging.  But I have found the way I think about normal issues, challenges, problems/solutions is more robust that before.<br /><br />Terrific read.
B004PYDBVM|5.0|After reading &#34;Escape from camp 14&#34; this was a must read. Glad I did. Gives the reader a very good understanding of the struggles of common Koreans who gave up so much for their country. Big decisions, big life changing events.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|Great movie.  It is pretty clean with only a couple of bad words.  It is clean with regards to sex.  There are two kisses by the princess and Jack.  It is truly action adventure.  There are parts that are played where the individuals are very noble.  This is truly a fairy tale and it is played out that way.  There is some great acting and some very good lines.  I am not sure why more people do not like this movie.  They have left an ending where there could be a second movie but my guess is not because it did not make a ton of money.  Our whole family liked this movie very much.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is fantabulous, it's super addictive and fun to play, I know that I'm gonna be playing this app a lot this summer
0812983459|4.0|A typical quest story with some interesting scenes along the way.  Some details such as his boating shoes were overworked and not believable.  The ending was predictable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|pocketinveditor is great for cheating in minecraft<br />u can spawn stuff its great u can edit ur inventory. love minecraft I'm a boy
B0084BMUFA|5.0|If only people would follow these lessons all year, the world would be a better place! Greed breeds greed charity breeds charity!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|While reading this book I never felt that it was a autobiography of the CEO of the most valuable company in the world. I felt as if I am reading about a eccentric Swami, a enlightened soul, having an aura around him which to some people working with him was a “reality distortion field”. The darker side of this ‘acid dropping hippie’ is as intriguing and mystic as his intuition for products. His approach to customer experience, business of controlling it and his philosophy of what products should stand for truly exemplifies the essence of innovation focused entrepreneurship. It is a lesson for – rather a tenet to be religiously abided by – future generation entrepreneurs. And now, without Steve Jobs at the helm, I am still hopeful in wishing that Apple will continue to flourish by building on Steve’s ‘reality distortion field’ legacy and deliver amazing-out-of-the-world products and user-experiences for generations to come.
0385349947|3.0|The book overall is a good read. I was not swayed by her background, don't think it was an issue as many have stated. She put into perspective things we all take for granted. Men and women everyday are treated differently in the workplace. This book identifies it and opens the dialogue for you to either accept the status quo or lean in. Unfortunately the mid/end of the book fell off for me. I felt it was overly saturated with maternal experiences, something I can't relate with at this time in my life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think the game is awesome. You get to have a horse and take care of it, put it in compatishon, and you get to also buy other horses for your other horse to play with.
030758836X|2.0|Was captive with the first half, but became contrived and end was a disappointment. Maybe a second book in works to figure these protagonists out. They deserved each other!
1589795474|4.0|There are a lot of stats in this book and also many nuggets of useful information. This book was a recommended read by Dave Ramsey, and so far, he has not steered me wrong!
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|I like Mirrors, but Justin ruined it by putting the long ending on the song. The other songs on the CD make me wonder what the heck Justin was thinking during the other 9 days.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a great game to make you think in a way to stay sharp, So you can change it very easy if goes boring.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Easy review..it does what it's supposed to do. Easy to connect and set up. If you have an old IPad or iPhone, get it to connect to your HDTV.
B004GYY714|4.0|this is a great & fun app you can listen to different police /  fire depts. from all over the us and radio stations I really enjoy it thanks
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Overall, for those who like watching trains, this was an interesting movie, based on a true incident that did happen back east with a run away train. Granted, the movie maker enhanced  the incident more than what really happen, but just to watch trains in action, I really enjoyed.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Malkovich's part as a paranoid ex-cia acid guinea pig was pretty funny and Bruce Willis is good as usual as the stoic, terse, long suffering uber-competent killer.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|His books are &#34;sit on the edge of your seat&#34; reads, and this one did not disappoint.  Also, it was nice to have the new show on TV, Maxwell and King, set up for you before it began.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|It amazes me how Ms Singh just keeps getting better.  I enjoy this series...but this story just was in amazing! The characters are painfully believable.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|This book was incredibly engaging to read, considering that it contains a lot of references to studies on change and behavior.  I put their advice to work in my life before I finished the book and am already reaping benefits, working on getting the Rider, the Elephant and the Path to collaborate.
0060574216|5.0|And furthermore, to confirm that, compare what Mr. Gray says about guys, and you'll say, &#34;That's just the reason why I do these things!&#34;  Compared it to my wife and she says the same thing.  So now we have been married for over 42 years...wish I had this book from the beginning, but glad I found it now!  Great book...live the good life.
B0063IH60K|4.0|a fun app to have for passing the time while waiting for appointments, etc. when you don't want to start a book.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|too many hero's, not enough back story? Seems like they only needed 2 or 3 to get the job done
0385736002|5.0|I cannot express how much I enjoyed this series.<br /><br />It weaves history, multiple mythologies from around the globe and throughout the ages, science fiction and fantasy against a modern-day backdrop filled with teen twins searching for their place in the universe, with fantastic results. It introduces you to historical figures drawn into the modern world, but without the time-travel shock of other stories that try to do the same. The action moves steadily, at a swift pace, building and building to a supernova-type climax, while the twists and turns keep you guessing about what's coming next. The diversity of characters - from Dark Elders to Next Generation, immortals to mortal humani - draws sharp contrasts while also blending the lines between the races. And it's hard to categorize 'good vs. evil' when the distinction between the two keeps shifting.<br /><br />While Sophie and Josh, the two main characters, are a bit weak in terms of character development, the supporting cast is so strong that they more than compensate for this one shortcoming of the series.<br /><br />Heartily recommended reading for all ages!
B005H9B44A|4.0|Great movie, I wish I would have watched it before the Avengers but it was fun to watch after too.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was a great movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love Robert Downey Jr.  he is fantastic and a great actor!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I thought the movie was entertaining, I like watching all of these Marvel movies and am excited for the next one to come out, I will defintiely be watching for more. The graphics and special effects were cool and the plot wasn't boring or annoying which can happen sometimes with these moveis.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is so awsome.I can not stop playing it.So I think if you like horses this is the game for you.It has a way to buy more horses.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes you think, but not so hard that it stops being fun. I'm looking forward to additional levels being released.
B003UYUP58|4.0|Just started this book and so far I find it very interesting.  It is well written and easy to read.  I am thinking of cancer in a new way now.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book is beautifully written n painful to read.  It gave me insights into the lives of ordinary women during this time period in Afghanistan.  I have been blessed n inspired by it.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|This is a great CD and sounds just like Linkin Park with great beats and hooks but it felt like it could have been a longer CD.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great writers, believable characters, realistic stories! Love this show so much that when each episode is over, we can't wait to see the next one! I find myself fighting for the lawyers to win!
B008602KQI|5.0|Gladiatorial games of the future with team sponsors. A very nice twist to the punishment for the riots of the past. I really don't care for the iron fist suppression of the  12 areas then the lottery to select 2 pre teen, teen or young adults to fight for their area where only one of the 24 can walk out alive. The movie has you begin to hate of the government for what it does then gets your heart beating faster when area 12 survivors mess with the protocol of the Hunger Games agenda and the head Hunger guy is served a lunch of berries he really didn't want. Can't wait for version #2 to come along
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this app.  waiting for more updates and rooms.  some challenge.  need more rooms soon that will be good
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love the Vampire Diaries so much! They have kept it exciting and eventful throughout the series and the action is non-stop!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This blends in so well with the original connector that you forget that it's even there. The magnets are very strong and durable; it takes quite a bit of force to pull it off the connector. If you try to pull the cord from your macbook, the adapter sticks with the cord.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Enjoyed it a lot, image quality was great, love that Amazon instant video now has caption available (at least that has been my experience with Dr. Who episodes so far).
B0026IUXME|5.0|I loved this movie so much on TV when I saw it that I had to order it and tell friends about it. Even though I was aware of the atrocities of the Holocaust, I really did not Know them. Sadly you are not taught this in school as you should. This mans fortitude and desire to survive are amazing and the fact that he did can only be attributed to God. Adrien Brody's depiction of Wladyslaw Szpilman's plight is indeed Oscar worthy and I am so glad he was acknowledge for his portrayal.
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|I like that this works and has the features of gmail, but the interface is terrible... it looks great, but doesn't shift or rotate with the kindle.  This is horrible!  I only type on my kindle in the vertical position.  It's much more difficult to type when the kindle is horizontal, so this app is essentially useless.  So frustrating.  If this were fixed, I'd use it all the time and would rate it 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its pretty fun i play this game whenever i get bored sooo...... i guess i recomemd it ummm...... there are lots of games on this app  obviously
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is thoroughly engaging, wonderfully philosophical, and surprisingly inspiring.  I do not want to give it away in the review, but this is an excellent story, gracefully told with incredible skill.  I recommend it for all readers.  My 13 year old daughter also read it and thought it was very, very good.
B00A6C3JN2|5.0|Now can all projects in my mind, is great product, simple asowe, compatible with android developed kid, open source hardware original product
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed all the puzzles in this game. It was fun to follow the story while using my brain. Looking forward to trying more G5 games.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|The Beach Boys are: A # 1, top of the Heap, and still rocking after 50 Years - Great Concert, and Great CD.<br /><br />We went to the concert 2 nights in a row, great show - CD accurately gives you the concert, wish they kept in the Beach Boys Kids singing - great show, I personally saw people of all ages having the time of there lives.<br /><br />Buy this one.
1574214276|5.0|This book is so helpful in explaining how to do the tangles and the materials to use including pens, paper, etc.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|Ringo is a Winner, and his All Starr Band are Winners also. What can be said for a man that helped change the world we live in, the clothes we where, music, and has been the giver of peace and love for all these years. You'll wish you had purched this DVD if you have not yet. Ringo is the greatest in this world, the next world, or any world you can find. Great music, graet video.<br /><br />Buy it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|No time to explain just how beautifully crafted, clever, and genuine this novel is. Not only does one witness the growth of Pat Peoples through his journey but witness growth within themselves. Weather the younger or the older crowd, this novel will move all ages to always seek a silver lining.<br />(Not that it is recommended for ALL ages, because of language and sexual themes, etc..but you catch my drift)
B00BS7HNTK|5.0|Great album; enjoy listening to the entire thing!<br />Of course &#34;Home&#34; is a hit on most's lists, but Kisses over Babylon isn't far behind - I really enjoy the 1970's kung fu movie vibe it gives (in my mind, at least), though the Spanish lyrics might throw that off for some, not I.  Hard to say anything else about any other particular, except put it in, press shuffle, and enjoy the entire thing, it great!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a kindle than got a tablet. Now I can just carry one item that fits in my pocketbook and have everything I need with me where ever I go, including all my ebooks!!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|this app will not download for me don't get it is a wast of time don't get it from me to you
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and interesting; some rooms take a lot of thought., some are easy and some are really hard and I celebrate when I get out of those rooms.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its challenging but not overly taxing. my three year old loves it when we play it together
0374531269|5.0|I read this book for an English class in my second year of college and at first I was iffy because it did<br />not really seem like a book I'd pick up on my own time (I dislike assigned readings) This book was different.<br /><br />Ishmael describes his experience as a boy soldier and the adventures he embarks on. Well written and I did<br />not want to put the book down. It constantly had me on the edge of my seat. Very quick read. Never saw what<br />was coming next which I very much like in books.<br /><br />This book was lovable, hopeful, sad, and explicit. It had a bunch of descriptive scenes, content, and other elements<br />I really enjoy in books.<br /><br />Definitely check this book out.<br /><br />P.S. I want my own copy soon.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I absolutely love Ellen Degeneres. She is so funny and always happy. I love her outlook on things. This book (although a strange) is definitely worth it.
B0051OZ564|3.0|I liked the girls in their exciting little costumes, and some of the visuals are stunning. The story itself is *not great*.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I really do appreciate this book. For the longest time I thought I was anti social and needed to be loud and rambunctious  like everyone else (a trait that took me a while to learn). Little did I know that my craving for me time was part of something greater. With that said this book is really exhaustive, it is not a light read, but worth the investment. If you ever want to delve into the world of an introvert this book is highly recommended.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|the new july updates freezes on my kindle fire.  sucks and will be uninstalling from my Kiele. don't install this crap
0307155102|5.0|I used this book with my own children over thirty years ago and so wanted to use it with my grandson who Is just a little over one but is so eager to learn. Children are exposed to a variety of jobs, animals, and a conglomerate of life. Exciting for everyone!
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it...a great read that makes you want for more...can't wait for the fourth book.  Exceptional writing at its finest.
B000LXQVA4|1.0|My son is almost 7 months old and this morning one of the three straps holding the Jumperoo came out of the holder and dumped him on his head, dangling from his legs which were still inside the harness. I am grateful that my son is medically ok, but it is unacceptable that something like this could happen to a child in a piece of equipment used exactly as directed. Buyer beware- don't risk your child's safety!
B0099114WO|4.0|I bought this movie due to the two main actors, the movie itself is &#34;ok&#34; - not one that I love.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game love bow it makes u think things over.  It is fun for the whole family.  Try it out for yourself and see if u can do it!
B000VDDDVO|4.0|I bought this movie because I remember it growing up - good childhood memories return as I watch the movie.
193700788X|3.0|*Spoilers* The book was okay. My biggest complaint was that it seems the characters took a 180 degree turn to how they thought and felt in previous books...mainly the characters that get together at the end, their didn't seem to be any attraction throughout the book, so of course their was no leading up to it.  In previous books Sam is like Sookie's older brother, in the beginning it was totally possible but the author kinda veered away from that in my perspective.<br />And in this book she has a multitude of people trying to kill her, as usual, yet I am supposed to believe that after this she lives \\"happily ever after\\". I would have preferred she died or lost her powers or something, that would be a more believable ending if not the prettiest.
055358202X|3.0|After the way #3 wrapped up I was so ready to dive into this one.  I'm only halfway through it at the moment but it's just so difficult to get into it.  It took far too long at the very beginning to even understand where I was at, who I was reading about and what was going on.  I think he's just introduced too many new character points of view at once that I have no connection with, and all the interesting storylines at the end of #3 are still just kind of out there...  Plus the way he's naming the chapters now with multiple titles all referring to the same person... Like the Damphair chapters have already been titled as \\"The Prophet\\" and then later on \\"The Drowned Man\\".  What's the point of that?  Is he trying to get all literary instead of just telling a great story?  Cuz I'm not getting it.  I hope #5 can redeem what this one is turning into.  About 500 pages gone and it's almost boring.<br /><br />EDIT:  Ok so I've finally finished it and was happy to see things starting to get interesting again around 800-900 pages in.  I still stand by everything I already wrote about it and still leaving it at 3 stars, but at least it left me looking forward to #5.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Easy to read. Enjoyable story with interesting main characters especially Don with his rigid schedules.  Funny at times.  Really loved it.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Michael Chiklis is the perfect actor for this role and he plays it brilliantly.  Show depicts the seamy side of politics, law enforcement and business.  Although a little vulgar for my taste, it is appropriate.
B000ICXQHE|4.0|Action-packed...keeps you guessing...Denzel maintains his acting prowess.  Worth the time to watch.  Not disappointing.  I'm including more words just to meet the minimum.
B00006ADGP|1.0|I chose this rating because this product is a fraudulent, cheap boot legg copy by this seller!!  It did not arrive with this cover, the audio and the visual were distorted and almost impossible to understand. It is really a shame because this is one of Ettore Scola finest work and certainly doesn't deserve to be handled this way!! Shame on this seller. My I hate it rating is certainly not for the original film but for the unethical handlind of this masterpiece. Their attitude I assume, anything for making a profit and I certainly do not want to contribute to their plan!!!<br />  Edeline Logreyra
B0074MZSWW|2.0|I saw these guys on Letterman and the rocked, so I decided to pick up their cd.  This music is nothing like what they played on Late Night.  CD recording quality is not good.  Looking forward to a live CD.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is fun. takes a little long to load but addicting. kid loves it she thinks it liketaking care of her real horse.
0688158129|5.0|The Pact is the first book I have ever read from author Jodi Picoult, and it was good enough to make me want to read all her other books too. This book made me feel pretty much every single emotion that you can feel. I think I felt these emotions so strongly while reading The Pact because I could see so much of myself in the characters of this book, especially Emily. Whenever anything happened to Chris or Emily or anyone else in the book, it was like that same thing was happening to me too. Any book can make you feel sad or angry or scared, but this book made me feel something else: a profound sense of longing, longing for the powerful and heartbreaking love that Chris and Emily had the fortune to share with each other. This longing hit me suddenly and unexpectedly as I was finishing the last page of the book and realized that most people will probably never find that same love. The Pact put me on an emotional roller-coaster ride that lasted the entire day I spent reading it. But it also did something else. It changed the way I look at the world, and really, that's all you can ask from a good book, isn't it?
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a really excellent story and sequel to Son of Neptune and The Lost Hero.  It is gripping, and I couldn't put it down until I got to the end to find out what happens.  Brace yourself -- the ending is a bit of a shocker...but I won't spoil it for you.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|If this  film was supposed to  aimed at only the Twilight series crowd or teens in general, it didn't work. What an amazingly appealing movie for everyone! Aliens inhabiting humans, yes. But gone are most of the cliches that steal from the \\"body snatcher\\" and the like type films. This is  a deep psychological study in what makes us so interestingly complex as human beings.  The writers of the film are in top form and all the actors make  what should be a far fetched story come brilliantly to life. I can't recall seeing  a film with such depth  in some time. Hang in there with the slow pacing especially at the beginning because it takes a stride or two to see what is actually unfolding. And once you \\"get it\\", there's no turning your head from the screen,  particularly for introspective sci fi fans.  Real love lessons take flight, and they are acted beautifully. \\"Wanda\\" will make you a believer..... in something greater than yourself. Just when I thought they don't make'em like this anymore. The Host is one of the best films of the year.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Excellent movie for children.  A fun story and we love Ursula the octopus.  The music is wonderful. The characters really are fun.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is an addictive fun little game that both myself and my four year old love to play :-) I recommend it!
B0000AK7AC|5.0|I have 4 year old grandchildren (twins) and they love this movie.  We have all watched it numerous times.  This one will outlast time.
B004DK5CW4|1.0|When I opened the DVD box for &#34;Secretariat&#34;, there was no DVD inside.  This was a gift and was not opened until July 11, so it appears that there is nothing I can do about this.  Amazon does not offer a direct way to contact them, and this is unsatisfactory to me since I have been a good customer for years.
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|Hands down...LOST is my favorite show EVER!  I know there were some haters, especially around seasons 2 and 3, but if you stay true and hang through the whole season, the symbolism is really mezmorizing.  Seriously...greatest show in the history of time!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was almost as good as the first book, and better than the second, but was too focused on the relationships of the characters for my taste. This is an all too common problem with science fiction as a genre lately. Authors are catering to a broader demographic to increase sales, at the expense of keeping the focus on traditional characteristics that make science fiction what it is. Too much drama slows down the action, and limits the development and description of the technological and societal aspects of the story. For me this is a negative, but if you want more romance and drama than you'll find in typical science fiction, books like this will definitely appeal to you.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Hands down...LOST is my favorite show EVER!  I know there were some haters, especially around seasons 2 and 3, but if you stay true and hang through the whole season, the symbolism is really mezmorizing.  Seriously...greatest show in the history of time!!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I saw the movie and had to have it on Blue-Ray for my collection. I was not dissapointed. Great movie with a decent plot.
B000TFINY6|5.0|Hands down...LOST is my favorite show EVER!  I know there were some haters, especially around seasons 2 and 3, but if you stay true and hang through the whole season, the symbolism is really mezmorizing.  Seriously...greatest show in the history of time!!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Saw this in the theater and had to have it for my home movie collection. The 3D version just addds to the enjoyment. I am a huge Lord of the Rings fan, and this did not dissapoint.
1932100660|4.0|I read this after a co-worker recommended it.  It's definitely VERY eye-opening in a good way about the dangers of what we eat.  I whole-heartedly support a plant-based diet; however, I don't believe that every animal product is evil either.  I think high-quality proteins and fats are key.  I'm not big on dairy, so I don't have any issue with proposing that people eat less.  It's a lot to absorb, but worth the read!
B00CD4RPWM|2.0|Apparently I am the only one who did not know that a Graphic Novel was a comic book.....guess I am out of the loop.<br />I really did not like it all.
B00001QEE9|5.0|The beauty of the animation and splendor of the score and depth of the characters will draw you in forever.  My children love the music, and each individual character's personality and they are fixated throughout this movie.  Jimminy Cricket was the genius of Walt Disney.  Jimminy is the thread that holds the story, Pinocchio, the bad guys at bay, and humor throughout the whole movie.  He is a very charming and caring &#34;conscience&#34; for Pinocchio, and the audience/children as well, and of course who can forget the tender conclusion to this story with the song &#34;When You Wish Upon a Star.&#34;
0385347774|5.0|Wonderful characters, unrelentingly compelling plot, great writing....This novel is one of the best I've read. I read it quite hungrily.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I was excited to find that Stephen King wrote some short stories just for Kindle and this one didn't disappoint.  Kept me on the edge of my seat but the ending was a little lame.  Should've been a little longer too!
B008133MDK|5.0|Fabulous! Beautifully filmed, fast paced and intriguing! Absolutely love this new take on a classic icon. Cumberbatch and Freeman are excellent as Sherlock and Dr. Watson.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I Love this game no glitches that I know of yet and u can sped money but I don't. I highly recommend this app
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good for kids and adults school age and up.  Great visuals and hidden clues.  Not a mindless game!  Lots of tough puzzles.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I Think it's a great game and idea , but it could be better (I did this for bananas) :)
147674355X|5.0|This book has become my new favorite book in the whole world, I wasn't gonna get it thinking grrr just another teenage love story (I am not a teenager haha)OMG I could not put it down, went to sleep at around 3:30 AM, I had butterflies through the whole book and I really cannot wait for Holders story.<br /><br />Colleen, I will be grabbing all your books.. U Rock  ;-p
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game! I am playing it everyday! It was worth the 8 bucks! I will continue to play it too!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|As a wild child in the days of youth, I had the pleasure of experiencing many live classic rock concerts.  Above and beyond all of them, Pulse has to be the most provocative live performance I've ever experienced.  After watching the show, I truly believe nothing can compare!  Pink Floyd is just \\"Pink Floyd.\\"  There's nothing in this world like them!
B003VPWX6K|5.0|It stimulates introspection.  Are we too obsessive about appearances, efficiency, dignity or even goals in our lives?  How much of value do we pass up by trying too hard?
B003UYV08E|5.0|Incredible hi tech special effects in Ironman 2 version. More action, new characters introduced in 2 version, & history of ironman's father all give interesting story theme to second version.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|The game is fun and I enjoy it. There is a puzzle piece I do not understand but can live with
B007IV11PM|5.0|Very big fan of the series from the years with David Tennant, really like what Matt Smith has done with the character and will be sad to see him go..series 5,6, & prolly 7 are at the tops of my all time series favorites
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Great product for those looking for a nice Keypad. The thumb stick is the only con about this time, it's rather hard and uncomfortable if used for a long time. That being said, I simply used an old PS2 Controller Thumb Stick and made some modifications for it to fit.
