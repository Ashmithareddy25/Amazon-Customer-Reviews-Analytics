B00138KNFK|5.0|Toto's seventh album, like it's fourth, gets its name from its chronological release order - in this case, the seventh album of new songs from Toto.<br /><br />On to the music!<br /><br />As everyone else has stated, the opening track \\"Pamela\\" was Toto's only Top 40 single off the album. Since Isolation, and even possibly since Toto IV was released, Toto's acceptance by the general listening public has been rather lukewarm, if not outright cold. Why the American listeners - compared to those in Europe and Japan - are less enthusiastic about Toto escapes me; I'm sure there are logical reasons, maybe even illogcial ones, that explain this in a way that makes sense. It is unfortunate that our only indicator, the Billboard Charts, measures popularity by (a) how much airplay a song or album gets and (b) how many copies of a song or album are purchased. This devolves into a discussion about listening preferences, attention spans, etc., and this is not the forum for that. Sorry, Billboard, but you're wrong. Completely wrong about Toto. Haven't always been, but you abandoned Toto in favor of groups (dare I even call them that) like Milli Vanilli and the like...so your judgment is obviously flawed. But I digress.<br /><br />To the general public - PLEASE give this disc a listen.<br /><br />Song by song impressions:<br /><br />Pamela - great pop tune, gets a good kick in the bass after the intro, which then settles into a shuffle groove reminiscent of \\"Rosanna\\"<br /><br />You Got Me - another up-tempo pop tune, a good-feeling foot-tapper that'll have you dancing like Deniece Williams in \\"Let's Hear it for the Boy\\"<br /><br />Anna - a very sweet ballad sung by Steve Lukather (follows a theme that Toto has - their love songs to women have names that always seem to end in \\"A\\": Rosanna, Pamela, Anna, Holyanna, etc.)<br /><br />Stop Loving You - Joseph Williams' lead vocals highlights this catchy tune, with Mike Porcaro's bassline punctuating the countermelodies; great song to cruise the highways to<br /><br />Mushanga - a subdued, polyrhythmic tune that at first felt out of place here, but it follows another pattern from Toto IV - on the LP version, \\"Africa\\" was the last song on side 1. If this had been an LP as well, this song would have the last position on Side 1; song will grow on you with every listen<br /><br />Stay Away - one of my favorites, this song gets into the rocker heart of Toto, with backing vocals by Linda Rondstadt (gotta love it!)<br /><br />Straight for the Heart - reminiscent of Katrina & the Waves' \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" tempo & rhythm pattern, another good cruising song with BGVs by Linda Ronstadt.<br /><br />Only the Children - Toto's songwriting usually includes a sensibility towards social issues, yet never going over the top to beat you on the head with a message; to use a phrase from Henry Rollins (as voiced by William Shatner), \\"I can get behind that\\"...<br /><br />A Thousand Years - beginning with this song, the album becomes more introspective; I really love the lush, sweeping synth/organ behind Joseph Williams' vocals. You get caught up in the melody as it takes you away...<br /><br />These Chains - 3/4 time shuffle groove that harks back to Toto IV; love Jeff's stickwork on this song. Mmm, delicious, just like a warm cup of Campbell's Tomato Soup on a cold winter's day.<br /><br />Home of the Brave - Closing out the album in style, this socially-conscious rocker pulls out all the stops like a true show-closer should.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Seventh One\\" represents Toto on the verge of returning to their success of Toto IV (success in terms of production quality, songwriting, etc. - not chart-wise), with hints at their direction for the future. I see this album as the foundation of later releases like \\"Tambu\\" or \\"Mindfields\\", both excellent recordings in their own right.ise the highways to<br /><br />Mushanga - a subdued, polyrhythmic tune that at first felt out of place here, but it follows another pattern from Toto IV - on the LP version, \\"Africa\\" was the last song on side 1.

B003MC5N28|5.0|I am not going to say much about the Giver. It's a masterpiece that all new dystopian writes keep getting ideas from and stealing from. In fact, my daughter was reading a series called matched i think and another series. Both owe the Giver everything in them. Whenever my daughter tells about an idea in the books, I have to laugh at how this was stolen from the Giver. So what is this review about?<br /><br />It's a bout that Lois Lowry set the perfect name for the book.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because The Giver GIVES 90% of today's dystopian fiction ideas and is never mentioned.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was a great read!  With wonderful, developed characters and a plot that has you reading long into the night.  You will fall in love with independent Diana from the beginning, and the commitment she makes to Matthew will touch you.

0871404133|4.0|Wilson's The Social Conquest of Earth is an effort to introduce the layman, of which I am definitely one, to his new understanding of evolution and to the implications of that new understanding. Throughout his career, Wilson has been an advocate of \\"kinship selection\\" as the principle force for evolutionary development, specifically the presence of altruism in humans. His new understanding proposes \\"group selection as the driving force of where we have been and where we are going\\" (p. 289). This constitutes a major shift in his perception of the importance of the group rather than the individual when attempting to answer the three questions he poses at the beginning of the book: \\"Where do we come from?\\" \\"What are we?\\" \\"Where are we going?\\"<br /><br />We are simply biological creatures caught in a perpetual conflict between our selfish and altruistic desires, what Wilson refers to as the \\"human condition.\\" It is without irony that Wilson points out that pursuing one's selfish desires produces behaviors often called sin and altruistic behaviors advance and benefit the social unit - the tribe, whatever its size. Within the dynamics of that conflict and with the understanding that multilevel natural selection shapes our evolutionary development, Wilson tries to explain the origins and importance of religion, culture, language, morality, and honor. Wilson states emphatically that within the tension of selfishness and selflessness we have free will and the capacity for self-understanding. In his forecast of where we are going, he calls for a \\"new enlightenment\\" based upon better self-understanding and recognition of what we are and where we have been, his reasons for writing this book for the layman.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun. some I would even say are great. but there are as many terrible (ie: mechanically broken or just conceptually bad) games as there are passable. so choose wisely.

0345803485|4.0|I must say that I did enjoy this series, as long as I considered it only a guilty pleasure. The story takes place in Washington, yet all of these British phrases kept popping up. I have no problem with the British, but the author should have been more careful about that. There were a lot of redundancies: the biting lip, the crimson cheeks, countless rounds of sex that were so abundant that they became boring. One thing that E.L. James should learn is the art of anticipation. If this was based on Twilight Fanfiction, then James could take a lesson or two from Steph Meyer. Here, the sex comes so readily that you don't get that sexual tension or buildup that makes romantic fiction so popular.<br /> Having said that, I did like this series. I didn't take it too seriously--just sat back and enjoyed. Christian Grey was a complex character who I wanted to learn more about, and I only wish that we had learned more about Anastasia's romantic past. Why, exactly, was she still a virgin??<br /> A good read. I recommend it if you're looking for an easy page turner....just don't think too hard while reading it.

0679731725|4.0|The Remains of the Day is a short book, one that I read in a few hours, but with a lot of substance. It follows the narrator, Mr. Stevens--no first name, as he's not on a first-name basis with anyone--as he takes a trip through the English countryside and ruminates on his career as a butler. The more he talks, the clearer it becomes that he's not as satisfied with his life as he tries to convince himself he is, and that his rationalizations don't quite hold water.<br /><br />For me this is pretty far toward the \\"literary\\" end of the spectrum, and I'm not generally a fan \\"mid-life crisis\\"-type books (well, this is more of a \\"late-in-life crisis\\" since Stevens is past middle age). So why did I like this one? Several reasons. It's well-written, in a completely convincing voice, and without pretension. Stevens alternates between anecdotes from the past, ruminations on his life and the simple tale of his current trip, all while sounding the way I imagine an actual English butler raised in the early 20th century would talk, without getting bogged down in heavily literary language. And there's no padding here: the book is the length it needs to be, long enough to tell the story but short enough that individual incidents are still meaningful. It's very understated, and makes the reader think, but you don't need an English degree to understand it either.<br /><br />In terms of emotional involvement, I prefer Ishiguro's more recent novel, Never Let Me Go; this is a high-quality book but didn't grab me with the same ferocity. (On the other hand, I didn't have the issues with the premise here that I did with Never Let Me Go.) This novel deals with many of the same themes--most notably, with people unquestioningly handing control of their lives over to others, and losing everything that's meaningful in the process--and it does an excellent job, but often more extreme scenarios are simply more hard-hitting. Nevertheless, this book is likely to have more real-life relevance for readers, particularly if you've ever defined yourself by your work or let yourself focus on little things to the exclusion of what's really important (and come on, who hasn't done that?).<br /><br />So I would recommend The Remains of the Day to anyone looking for an intelligent but accessible literary novel. It will take up very little of your time and will almost certainly be worth it.aders, particularly if you've ever defined yourself by your work or let yourself focus on little things to the exclusion of what's really important (and come on, who hasn't done that?).<br /><br />So I would recommend The Remains of the Day to anyone looking for an intelligent but accessible literary novel.

B00454U1NS|3.0|The disk is fine and the packaging is in English, but when I upload it to my player it's all in Japanese (I think).  This was not stated on amazon anywhere that I can find.  Pretty lame.  I'd rather not give it a numerical rating because P!nk is awesome, but this particular product kind of pissed me off.  For that reason I'm giving it a 3.
B0055QYKQO|2.0|I am very disappointed in this motherboard.  It was professionally installed to support an AMD FX-8120 8 core processor and the combination was unstable right from the start - numerous spontaneous reboots with no blue screen errors or other warnings.  A number of solutions were tried including a re-build of Windows 7, a new, larger power supply, and a massive processor heat sink.  After further investigation it was discovered that the board I was shipped was at the revision 1.0 level instead of the latest level 1.1.  In addition, the BIOS level was almost a year out of date.  I upgraded the BIOS using the Gigabyte support site and the board is now stable but it is only supporting 4 processor cores instead of the original 8.<br /><br />Like I said, very disappointing.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|Clear, conscise and personal, a thorough book about an issue that somehow has been largely overlooked. As a psychologist I was surprised at not having read about the matters covered in this book. It explores the Culture of Personality with an emphasis on extroverted behavior (without necessarily skills to back it up), and the pathologizing of being introverted and sensitive as the Culture of Character has died away. It reminds me of a professor of mine who was puzzled by why a classmate of his who was very outgoing had succeeded in the abscence of strong skills.<br /><br />I think the reader will recognize intuitively what is described scientifically. My highlighter certainly ran dry. It makes us understand why introverts, driven by a single passion that is a call of conscience instead of a call of politics or personality, are behind many of the great inventions after having had the focus and determination to work solitarily and singularly towards their goal for years. It also shows, very interestingly, that introverts can thrive in online collaborations, and casts a dark shadow on workplaces without privacy.
1452101248|5.0|Vegetables we know in ways that are new!  All my other cookbooks have taken a bit of a back seat.  I'm working my way through and have loved everything so far.  Never thought I would actually embrace eggplant!  First came across it while looking for a vegetarian cookbook (I'm not a vegatarian, but was interested in adding a lot more to my diet this summer), but did not order it right off.  Was surprised to see it at my local library, checked it out, took it home and promply ordered my own copy.  No doubt - I had to have this book.  Have not put it down for over a week.  I think my husband is beginning to wonder . . . .  Made the eggplant recipe on the cover - it turned out perfectly, tasted great and what a presentation!  Wow!  If you order one cookbook this season - this is the one!

0143119680|5.0|What a great read!! What more could you ask for? Vampires,witches and daemons. Plus it has historical facts with fiction, time travelers,magic,sorcery and a great love story. You just can't help really enjoying all the characters. I must applaud Deborah Harkness, she did a terrific job putting the story together,the plot is excellent. Believe me, it was very hard to put the book down. I was reading way past the witching hour. I just couldn't put it down. The worst part was when the book ended and I just wanted more like and addict. I can't wait for the next book. I know it will be another great and fun read!!
B007MLDC2I|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this movie.  It was very well made, the acting was really good, and the story was compelling.  We can't wait for the next one in the series to come out and I will read the book series once I finish reading Game of Thrones.<br /><br />Important Note:  This movie is definitely not appropriate for children.  There are some very adult themes, and there are a couple of pretty disturbing rape scenes.
B001I0T92Q|3.0|This item comes with a nice package, but itself does not look very solid (made of thin plastic and you should hold it very carefully when the slots are empty - very easy to bend and break). I used one slot of the two (with one 16G class 10 micro SD card), and tested it on my PSP and a SONY camera. It is hard to install the card - the adapter is thicker than normal memory sticks so I have to push hard. I could not feel the lock so I dont know if the adapter is locked or got stuck - simply push it as far as possible. And later if you want to take it out, you may need tools like tweezers (you can not pull it out with your fingers only).<br /><br />Both devices recognize the card. But I was not able to format the card with my PSP (camera is okay). If you use your computer to format the card, you'll need to copy or create the necessary folders for your SONY device. The Read and Write of the card is okay (saving and loading a game, or transferring files in USB mode). The PSP may freeze a while when you exit the USB mode. I tested the R/W speed on PSP, the micro card itself (class 10) reaches 10+ M/s on PC but if you R/W through the device and the adapter you probably will get 5 M/s.<br /><br />To conclude, this item does its job, but do not expect too much.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have not watched the HBO series, but all the buzz it is generating compelled me to read this book.  I am definitely hooked and stay up way to late reading.  I am currently on the third book.<br /><br />I would characterize this as adult fantasy.  Most of the fantasy I have read is PG-13 and very heavy on the magic.  This is rated R and heavy on political intrigue.  In fact there is very little magic in this book at all.  (There is a little more later in this series.)  I like magic in fantasy, but some authors use it too heavily.  Martin keeps it mysterious.<br /><br />Each chapter is titled with the name of the character it is about and it is from that character's point of view (POV).  Martin does a great job writing from each character's perspective, and interestingly, even though you will have favorites, there is no judgment passed.  My favorites are Tyrion and Arya.  Others have commented that Martin does a great job writing his female characters, and I have found this to be true.  Some of the characters are children and he does a great job of writing from their perspective, too.  It is all very convincing.<br /><br />I read this on the Kindle and did not notice any editorial or formatting problems that some have reported.<br /><br />If you are an adult, enjoy complex stories with grey morality, and are not intimidated by large books, you will love this series.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn is one of my favorite authors and this is by far her best book yet.  I defy anyone to figure out the twists and turns before they come.  It's a tour de force by an author at the top of her game.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I haven't anything good to say about this item. It's cheap and flimsy. I was going to return it but Amazon told me to keep it and they'd credit my account for it's purchase price.

0307594165|5.0|Thanks Miss Toni for this beautifully written story. Frank and Cee truly touched my heart. I literally couldn't put it down and finished it in two nights.<br />I must admit that I gave up on Miss Morrison after Paradise but I am so happy I decided to give this novel a chance.<br />Her sentences are so beautifully produced and filled with emotion, symbolism, and  American historical references. After two days I am still emotionally attached to this story.<br />I highly recommend this book but beware some of the events are very strong and push against our moral sense of right and wrong but surprisingly her good writing allows the reader to observe otrocities without unhindered outrage.
1455508977|2.0|I was very excited to get my new copy of The Lucky One. I have to say once I started reading the book, I really couldn't get into it. The Lucky One was based on a good plot however seemed to be poorly written and predictable. It did not keep me interested at all. Through most of the book I was very bored and thought about not finishing it but I kept trudging and finally finished the book. It was not worth the time and effort!
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Today, I stumbled upon Emeli Sande's Our Version of Events and listened to the preview. I've never heard of her before but I was immediately attracted to the sound. The hip/hop influenced, break-beat percussion mixed with intricate instrumentation pulled me in initially and song-writing sounded solid, so i made the purchase. The first time I listened to the album in it's entirety, I realized that this is not your average POP album. Some of these songs have depth in a way that allows for multiple interpretations of the meaning (Next to Me, River, Lifetime), while others are just solidly written. This will definitely go into heavy-rotation!

0439023483|4.0|It was good; I can see why it's been so popular with tweens and younger readers. Collins does a good job giving the reader a strong main character to identify with, and the actual hunger games part of the book is written at a crisp pace that relates the intensity of what it taking place with the characters.<br /><br />Overall, Collins borrows heavily from Philip K. Dick in that she sets the book in a sci-fi future that is more fi than sci. For the most part people live as they always have except that the government is centralized and dictatorial after a war, which is straight up PKD (not necessarily a bad thing). There are some hi-tech aspects, but those are mostly in the background.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that this is the first book of a three-book series. To me, this book should (and most definitely could) stand on its own. The main plot line is resolved, and satisfyingly so. I really don't need (or want) any more than that.
0345803485|5.0|I read the first book in no time at all-a week or less.  It usually takes me awhile to read a book but this one, I couldn't put it down.  IV really enjoyed reading it.  It has a good story line along with other stuff.  IV never been so excited about reading and seeing what happens next.  I feel it's a great book to read.  I hope EL James will write more on the 2 in the book.  Reading the 2nd one which I'm almost done with (less than a week) and knowing the 3rd is the last it makes me not want to finish the 3rd.  Her books leave you wanting more.<br />IV read some good books but these are amazing!

Hoping EL James will write more for her fans on Fifty Shades of Grat.  Very well written which makes you feel you can picture it all in your head what is happening.  Makes you feel your there in some way.  I recommend her books.  Very good!!!

Frankenstein was the first book, and I think it was an interesting way to start this kind of challenge. I was interested in reading the book because I knew from my friend's blog posts that the book is completely different from the the movie interpretations of Frankenstein.  I'm going to reread this book again in the future because I have a feeling it is one of those books that you get something different out of each time you read it.

B005LAIHQ8|5.0|The original MEN IN BLACK was memorable because it was a quirky sci-fi movie that had just the right balance of comedy and action. MEN IN BLACK 2 followed in that same vein, but the film wasn't as strong and felt more like a retread. MEN IN BLACK 2 was released in 2002 and a decade later (due to script issues, scheduling conflicts, and budget problems), the boys are back in MEN IN BLACK 3 and while the film isn't as funny as the original, it's a far superior film to MEN IN BLACK 2.<br /><br />The film begins on the lunar prison base, a maximum security facility that was specifically designed to hold Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement who seems to be channeling Tim Curry), the last member of a species of creatures that's sole purpose was destroying and devouring other civilizations. Boris has been in prison for forty years and what he really wants is to travel back through time and kill the man responsible for his imprisonment and the loss of his arm: Agent K. Through some stealth planning, Boris escapes.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) still work for the top-secret organization that protects the Earth from intergalactic threats. Events during the past few days convince K that Boris is out to kill him. While that's true, K is mistaken on just when Boris plans to commit his crime. After fighting Boris, K & J have an argument of sorts. The next morning, J awakens and discovers that all signs of K have been erased. He soon learns that K was killed forty years earlier. J has to travel back through time to 1969 and prevent the younger K (Josh Brolin) from being killed.<br /><br />There will be some who will be disappointed by MEN IN BLACK 3 because though there are plenty of jokes and lots of humor, the film isn't as funny as the original film. However, what makes the movie a better film that MEN IN BLACK 2 is the characterization and a script full of pathos, not to mention plenty of action.<br /><br />MEN IN BLACK 3 focuses on the relationship between K & J. The chemistry between the characters is the main reason that MEN IN BLACK was so successful; the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was a great casting move. That chemistry remains and is just as strong between Smith and Josh Brolin. However, MEN IN BLACK 3 examines why that chemistry works. Though it sacrifices some of the comedy, I enjoyed the overall emotional tone of the movie. The MEN IN BLACK movies have always been fun, but MEN IN BLACK 3 provides the series with a heart and stable emotional core.<br /><br />Besides Smith and Jones who are excellent as usual, Josh Brolin should be commended for his fine work as a younger Agent K.

The chemistry between the characters is the main reason that MEN IN BLACK was so successful; the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was a great casting move. That chemistry remains and is just as strong between Smith and Josh Brolin. However, MEN IN BLACK 3 examines why that chemistry works. Though it sacrifices some of the comedy, I enjoyed the overall emotional tone of the movie. The MEN IN BLACK movies have always been fun, but MEN IN BLACK 3 provides the series with a heart and stable emotional core.<br /><br />Besides Smith and Jones who are excellent as usual, Josh Brolin should be commended for his fine work as a younger Agent K.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great little pocket sharpener. For the money you really can't beat it. No it's not like sitting down with some stones, but to put in a fishin box or something like that, it get's the job done..Good buy
B00846REIS|1.0|Well, like most reviewers here, I am a big fan of \\"Fifty Shades,\\" and bought this because it seems to be highly rated by \\"Fifty Shades\\" fans.  Boy, was I disappointed.  (and in fact I'm sick of reading really bad books that have high ratings on Amazon-- not sure what's up with that!)<br /><br />The reason I'm writing a negative review is that the book is nowhere near as good as \\"Fifty Shades\\" (despite the many positive reviews that say otherwise!).  Yes, the overall tone of the book is very slick and sophisticated, and in fact the writing style is much more polished and stylish than \\"Fifty Shades.\\"<br /><br />But this book, \\"Bared to You\\" is all style and no substance.  Despite its somewhat awkward writing style and flaws of repetition, the reason readers fell in love with \\"Fifty Shades\\" is the incredible depth and EXTREME EMOTIONAL INTENSITY of the love story.  \\"Bared to You\\" may have all the plot elements of \\"Fifty Shades\\" (young hero and heroine, messed-up & muscular & gorgeous billionaire protagonist, childhood trauma, lots of sex)  but the EMOTIONAL INTENSITY just isn't there.<br /><br />You can't fall in love with the characters of \\"Bared to You,\\" because you don't particularly feel that they are falling in love with each other (they go straight from being strangers, and, after a couple of unintersting sex scenes, almost instantly are in love.  The emotionally intense process of \\"falling in love\\"  is completley missing; there's no development of the reasons why they would fall in love with each other, other than the fact that they're both rich and good-looking).  The overall effect is somewhat bland and very shallow.<br /><br />  I had high hopes for \\"Bared to You,\\" based on the many good reviews.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!<br /><br />  Also, and on a separate note, this book is such a SHAMELESS RIPOFF of \\"Fifty Shades,\\" that I honestly believe there should be lawyers and lawsuits here. I find it hard to believe that the publication of such a book is legal. Everything--from the characters, the plot, down to the cover art is a shameless rip-off.  Surely there are laws against this sort of thing!<br />  However, all of that is actually NOT the reason I am writing a negative review. I bought this book knowing it was strongly based (or copied from) \\"Fifty Shades.\\"  In fact , that's why I bought the book.  I think it's unfair, though , that this author is enriching herself by so obviously copying \\"Fifty Shades.\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was not exactly what I expected.  It was tastefully written about a time that could actually happen with the way the world is heading.  I was pleasently surprised that the book was not all gory, but a good story.  It was so much better than the movie which had to leave out so much of it.  Probably because much of the book is what is being thought about in the minds of the characters.  I could not put it down and immediately purchased the two sequels to THE HUNGER GAMES.  I read all 3 books in 2 1/2 days while on a road trip.

Second, you don't buy someone a mac book pro and a Blackberry. How much was she paid for everytime she used the word Blackberry? And I thought it made her seem like such a technological bumpkin when she referred to the mac book like something that could guide the space station. I like to think I have an open mind but this book IS pornographic! As a woman born in the time of the womem's lib movement, it made me angry that to please him sexually, she allowed him to abuse her. i want to slap her myself to wake her up that she doesn't need to do that

B00846REIS|5.0|This story is hot.  Not just about one f*ed up individual trying to correct the past, but about 3 (a Gideon and Eva and her best friend Carey) and throw in some respective family members and it can turn into an absolute circus at times.<br /><br />We all suffer from dysfunctional families and some kinds of abuse of all different kinds.  This is a hot story about 2 people trying to face their demons and make it work.<br /><br />The author wrote the book very skillfully and at times you are hanging with the twists in the plot.  She definitely leaves you hanging and breathless at the end of the novel, waiting in lustful anticipation for the next part of the story.<br /><br />I loved the story and I can't wait for the next book to come out.  In fact I am going to pre-order it today.
B0079J28NW|5.0|I remember seeing this on the big screen when it was first released in 1968 when I was a true Beatle maniac.  I guess I still am really.  When I first saw it I remember thinking I wished someday I could have my own copy of it.  At that time there was no such thing as a VHS or DVD player so that thought was merely a fantasy.  Then along came VHS and I bought it on its first day of release.  Then years later it came out on DVD and I got it.  When I got the DVD I thought the color was not as good as my original Big screen viewing.  Well my friend the restored frame by frame hand painting was better than the first time I remember seeing the movie.  God bless the restorers they did an unbelieveable job.  I enjoyed every minute of this new version and the color is spectacular.  I also believe even if you've never seen this movie you will really enjoy it.
B0068MNNOE|4.0|Roland Emmerich, best known for directing mostly popcorn munching fare (\\"Independence Day\\", \\"2012\\", \\"10,000 B. C.\\") goes full costume in this theoretical mystery surrounding the works of William Shakespeare.  For centuries, Shakespeare's numerous plays, poems and sonnets have been probed for authenticity as little, if any, of original Shakespeare's handwritten documents survived.  Writer John Orloff makes a case for the Earl of Oxford being the ghost writer in collusion with Will (Rafe Spall) and Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto).<br /><br />The numerous subplots are often hard to follow what with all the earls, dukes, kings and queens all involved in subterfuge to name the heir to Queen Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave).  Oxford (nicely played by Rhys Ifans) has a burning desire to write and write he does.  Because of his nobility however, publishing would be unheard of.  Writing was perceived by the religious right as blasphemous although that was not the Queen's belief.  In any case writing would be beneath the stature of the Earl.<br /><br />Integrated into the story are numerous bastard children including those born of the Queen herself.  Admittedly I'm a sucker for these British royal dramas and this one was no different, well, except that I didn't buy much of the Shakespeare theory being offered.  Still, the costumes are wonderful, the acting is first rate and the story is fun if unlikely.  But who knows?

B007MDB71O|5.0|You know, the BD and DVD were just released today, and there are 300+ reviews. Folks, we're not just supposed to wax on about what we think of the movie - we're supposed to review the whole experience.<br /><br />So, here it is. The Disney film adaptation of John Carter of Mars. This is a film that was attempted in the past and the technology simply did not exist. My first encounter with the John Carter character was the 1970's Marvel comics (which I still have in storage thankfully). He was the strongest, fastest, and considered to be the best hero earth had to offer to Mars.<br /><br />Barsoom is simply amazing. Every small detail, right down to the punishment brands, was not put into the film because it looked cool - it was there because it made for a action packed motion picture designed to introduce this 100 year old character of literature to a new audience. So, some exceptions might have been made during production. Go read the books (Princess from Mars comes first) and then watch the film. Then make up your own mind. I simply loved it.This is one of those BD releases I wait for - amazing cinematography and editing along with... wait for it... a 7.1 DTS-HD, and it plays wonderfully though the right system and a great HD TV.<br /><br />As for the behind the scenes, we get a doggie bag filled with little but interesting featurettes: deleted scenes, bloopers, commentary, but nothing new.<br /><br />If you make claim to be a fan of pulp and classical sci-fi and you have an awareness of the character, I think you'll likely enjoy this fun romp across the expanse of Mars. No awareness of the character is needed, so any genre fan would do well to check this out.<br /><br />>>> This review is brought to by a person that actually watched everything in the BD release and not from someone who just waxes on about the theatrical presentation of the film. /rant  &lt;&lt;&lt;
0547258305|5.0|It took me almost no time at all to fall in love with Kristin Cashore's main character, Katsa, in Graceling. In this book for young adult readers, Katsa is a strong -- both literally and figuratively -- sharp-minded young woman who practices a well-developed sense of ethics, knows herself, and knows what she wants (and more importantly, what she doesn't want). What a wonderful role model she is for the female teenagers who are Cashore's target audience! How much better it would be for a 13-year-old to read about this type of young woman than about some swoony female who falls for a vampire because he glimmers in the dark!<br /><br /> Katsa has a \\"Grace\\" -- a special innate ability, as is evidenced by her eyes, one green, one blue. Her Grace reveals itself when she is 10 years old and a cousin makes sexual advances on her: she kills him. Swiftly, efficiently, and without thought, she smashes him in the face, pushing the bones of his nose into his brain. Everyone concludes that she is Graced with an ability to kill, though it also evidences itself with an uncanny ability to fight, to anticipate the movements of her enemies, and to avoid sickness. Still, others born with different-colored eyes are graced with such things as an uncanny ability to dance, or to swim like a fish; a Grace for killing is frightening to most, and her Grace therefore tends to isolate Katsa.<br /><br /> The logical thing for Katsa's king to do in response to a child Graced with killing is to banish or kill her, even if she is his niece. But King Randa of the Middluns thinks instead of the use to which he can put her as an assassin or at least an enforcer, and keeps her close. He is not an evil man, but he is certainly greedy, and Katsa learns to hate the use to which he puts her. When he sends her to hurt one of his lords who has refused to offer up a daughter to an unsuitable marriage for which King Randa would receive the dowry, she must make a decision about whether she intends to live the rest of her life as a king's instrument of power.<br /><br /> But that is only the beginning of her story. Katsa soon finds herself traveling with Po, a young prince from another country, to find out the story behind his grandfather's kidnapping. Katsa tries her best not to fall in love with Po, because she has sworn never to marry or bear children. She falls nonetheless, but still manages to remain true to her decisions about how to lead her life, and how to make her life one with room for fully realized love.<br /><br /> This is what most impressed me about Katsa. Imagine: a woman who wants to remain wholly herself, for herself! Have you ever read about such a character in young adult fiction before? Heck, how often have you read about a female like this, of any age, in any fiction? I was even more amazed when Katsa was thrown into contact with a young child, a girl of 10 who needs her protection, and still doesn't change her mind about bearing children of her own. Even today, one is considered unnatural for making such a choice. Cashore's decision to write of such a woman in a medieval setting it strikingly imaginative.<br /><br />Katsa's quest becomes, as so many quests do, a voyage of self-discovery, though not in the traditional sense (that is, she does not change her mind about who she is, but instead discovers more about what she is able to do). In this story, she is the hero rather than the rescued. She does the rescuing. It does not make her male counterparts any weaker, but only makes her stronger.<br /><br /> I fear I am making Graceling sound like a feminist polemic. It is not. It is an exciting and well-told tale about a pair of fascinating characters, Katsa and Po, and the challenges they face. The supporting characters are equally well-drawn; Randa's son Raffin, for instance, is essentially a scientist who seems to have missed inheriting his father's greed and cruelty. Still, I find Graceling remarkable mostly because Katsa is such a strong character.<br /><br /> I wish I'd had this sort of role model to read about when I was a young teenager. For me, Little Jo from Louisa May Alcott's Little Women was about the only example I ever read of a girl who wanted to do something with her life besides get married and have babies -- and even she wanted to write in addition to getting married and having babies. The idea that a woman could eschew the role of wife and mother was never presented to me. Thank goodness girls today know that that's a choice, and that women like Kristin Cashore are writing characters who aren't afraid to make that choice.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This is a good film.  Is it well-rounded enough to be a great film?  No, but that's not the point.  Its a solid, satisfying film which tells a specific story.  I think most people will know before they see it if they will like it or not.  I won't spend any time on that aspect of it.  Two criticisms I don't understand though are the acting and that it is a propaganda film.<br /><br />Lots of critical reviews fault the acting but I don't really understand that.  Sure some of the lines are flat compared to Brad Pitt or someone but isn't that balanced or even made better by having the real people say them?  It's like being mad that real life isn't as idealistically delivered as Hollywood lines.  Sometimes we say flat or cheesy stuff in real life.<br /><br />Second the propaganda angle is also a bit off.  Its simply a film about people of high character doing cool but dangerous stuff and it gives them the credit they deserve.  Its just a pseudo documentary.  It hardly sugar coats anything, no spoilers but bad things happen to bad people and good people in the film.  Maybe a little simplistic for the critics but most people really are a lot simpler than people in \\"the movies\\" anyway so whats wrong with a film of well-adjusted people now and then.<br /><br />Finally, there is no comparison between this and many of the completely average movies out there.  I mean it grossed about the same amount as Contraband.  Really? How is that remotely as good as this movie on any basis?
B002N5N5QQ|1.0|This show is terrible, shoddy acting, unbelievable storylines, the montages with awful cover songs, etc etc.<br /><br />1. The supposed \\"good guys\\" are gun brokers to gangs and murderers in their own right, I could care less about them. That's one of the main things that makes a series good is that you actually care about the characters but these guys are such scumbags all around it's actually painful to watch. I'm glad they lost overall at the end of this season. I was hoping for a better second season but this was worse than the first one and that's saying a lot. I won't be wasting time on this series anymore. Glad I only borrowed it.<br /><br />2. It's a sad thing to see the cops in the back pockets of these gangsters. It's embarrassing to see the Chief of Police following them around and even taking part in their crimes, a little todie. He even rats out his own \\"brothers\\" the FBI and ATF to this gang, endangering not just the informers lives but the lives of fellow law enforcement officers, awful. This is supposedly to protect some town from the real world? As long as they kill outside of city limits its OK with the police? I'd be afraid to live in a town like this, who knows what's next with the corrupt police and this biker gang. The cops even look the other way when someone is about to be killed? Even if Sobel is a bad guy what self respecting police officer would do that? The process of the law is one thing among others that makes us a society but this show seems to think it's all OK if one set of bad guys kills another or you're \\"protecting\\" a town, ugh! Murder is wrong no matter who does it and who it is done to.<br /><br />3. The constant song montages are so cheesy and overdone, ugh!! The covers are awful as well. Just a filler so everybody can LOOK so deep in emotion and to be pitied, etc. Weak minded people love this stuff.<br /><br />4. Trying to make criminals into family men and righteous vigilantes etc is so terrible. I was sickened by all the hugsand love yous between criminal killers I wanted to gag! This show is so embarrassing to watch. I'm just sorry I gave this POS another seasons worth of my time.<br /><br />5. A doctor turns into a helper for a criminal gang and even assaults and threatens hospital staff when she's reprimanded for it? Please. She needs to take that stick out of her a.. as well I've never seen a character so constipated before!<br /><br />The shallowness of it is so obvious, the characters are wooden(Clay) or miscast(Jacks). Genna, mother Sons, is such a lowlife it's another layer of BS that makes me dislike this show so much.<br /><br /> If you want a realistic and well done drama you need to go to the premium channels. Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, etc. For a decent but not great regular cable drama I like Justified. But this is just tripe.<br /><br />It's sad to see so many weak minded lovers of this tripe, good maybe it keeps you busy watching the tube so you don't do more damage to society by your idiocy.

B001FB5634|5.0|*** WARNING: The following contains numerous SPOILERS, including discussion of THE ENDING. So if you haven't seen the movie yet and still plan to, STOP READING NOW! You have been warned! ***<br /><br />How does a person even begin to rate a movie like \\"The Road\\"? Where to start? If you have seen it, then you realize that this is quite a dilemma.<br /><br />Sci-fi movies are all about \\"what ifs\\". What if time travel where possible? What if zombies took over the world? That sort of thing. These type of \\"what ifs\\" tend to fall into the following sort of broad categories:<br /><br />- Cautionary Tales (usually of mankind's future)<br />- Moral Quandaries<br />- Action / Adventure<br />- Horror<br />- Comedy<br />- Love Stories<br />- Cheesy Fun / Entertainment<br /><br />Now along comes \\"The Road\\", a movie that defies all of those categories...<br /><br />Is it a Cautionary Tale? Well, not really. The movie never spells out exactly what exterminates all life on earth, sans humans (and apparently dogs). And rightly so, because there is no plausible way for this to happen. A nuclear winter might make life difficult for plant-life, but it wouldn't eradicate it. A giant asteroid that sends a dust cloud up could again, make surface life harsh. But it wouldn't annihilate it.<br /><br />There are several ways that life could be destroyed on earth, but all of them involve the destruction of humans, too. The blocking of all sunlight would stop most plant life, leaving humans intact. But it would also cause a radical swing in the surface temperature, likely killing off the humans. And it would still allow mushrooms and such to grow, and the insects and small animals that eat them, which is something not depicted in this movie.<br /><br />Perhaps a virus occurred at the same time, killing off many animals? This is possible. It would also allow for the fact that in this movie, corpses still decompose. Which would indicate the presence of microbial life. But how could there be lifeat the microscopic level, yet no animals left to eat them? And how could a surface virus eradicate all life in the oceans as well?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining that the movie is not realistic. I am simply making observations. The premise of this movie cannot be taken seriously as science fiction. And it is obvious that the author did not intend it to be.<br /><br />What did he intend then? Does the movie fit into the Moral Quandary category?<br /><br />No. At least, not that I could tell. It tries to do this, in some ways. But this is hindered by the fact that the humans on the screen do not act like humans do in real life. Throughout history, in situation after situation, humans have proven that when catastrophes occur, moral altruism prevails. Humans often give their lives to protect others, even complete strangers. While rioting and lawlessness can and sometimes does take place, the vast majority condemn such practices. And where there is no law, good people will band together to create it. Besides, stealing a TV in a riot is a lot different from eating somebody's baby. Just sayin'.<br /><br />(Some would argue with me about that, saying that they would be the first to eat my baby in such a situation. Yeah, right. I don't think so.)<br /><br />The only moral quandary that might exist would be eating the dead. I don't think that reasonable people would have a problem with that, under the movie's proposed condition.<br /><br />Also, the mother did not act like a real mother would toward her child. Within humans, hope springs eternal, no matter what the situation. It is ingrained in our genetics to protect our young, no matter the personal cost. Sure, this sometimes goes haywire in some parents. But when it does, the crazy type is far more likely to kill his/her entire family before suicide. I did not find the mother's actions to be realistic.<br /><br />What then? Is it an Action/Adventure movie? Sort of. Not really.<br /><br />Horror? Well, it is certainly horrific. But it doesn't fit that trope either.<br /><br />A Comedy? Uh. No.<br /><br />How about a Love Story? Now this is the closest it gets. The story is completely about the love of a father for his son. But I don't think I would tell someone \\"Hey, watch The Road - it's a love story!\\"<br /><br />Cheesy fun? No. Entertainment? Well... possibly. It depends on if you find watching the most depressing movie on earth to be entertaining.<br /><br />So the movie is original. It doesn't fit the mold. Is that a good thing? You tell me.<br /><br />One reviewer likened it to porn. In a way, I see his point. The movie makes you feel certain ways (in this case, frightened and depressed), exciting certain emotions for no apparent reason. It could never happen in real life, which makes you wonder why you even care. And the story is so relentlessly bleak to the point that the ending is very unsatisfying.<br /><br />In some ways this reminds me of the so-called \\"torture porn\\", like the Saw movies. Where you know what you are watching would never happen, but it is entertaining to watch anyway. Like the macabre excitement of staring at a wreck. Without the father/son love story, this movie would truly be lost.<br /><br />That is the soul of it then, the father/son story. How much does a father (or any parent) love their child? And what would they do for them? If the movie is worth watching for anything, it would be that. Unfortunately, the message is undercut somewhat by the insane/hopeless behavior of the mother. Her suicidal behavior was supposed to be rational. The father's hope was supposed to be irrational. I don't agree.<br /><br />The movie was difficult to watch, in many places. I had a hard time watching the father demonstrate to his son how to kill himself. It really bothered me. It was meant to be disturbing, for sure. But why am I watching a movie to be disturbed in such a way, unless I really am watching it for some sort of \\"torture porn\\" effect? At least in most horror movies (which I love), there's an undercurrent of macabre humor to the proceedings. In The Road, this horror is a different beast altogether.<br /><br />Bleak. Foreboding. Impossible... A kid raised on nothing but canned food for over 10 years? Cannibalistic barbarians rampaging across the countryside? And... a dog still living in those same conditions?<br /><br />There are a lot of things in this movie that are hard to love. In fact, it's easy to hate.<br /><br />I hated the mother for not acting like a mother. I hated the father for almost killing his son. I hated the kid for being useless. I hated when the dad made the black man strip. And I hated it worse when they put his clothes back down, but it never showed whether he found them or not. And I hated at the end when the people said they had been following the kid the whole time. For what? How creepy is that?<br /><br />Especially, I hated that there was no hope given at the end of the movie. The father apparently died for nothing. Because at the end, the kid was no better off than he was before.<br /><br />There's still no food source. No plants. Oh, but this lady here is kind of nice. And her kids look friendly. Oh, and here's a dog. Say, what? A DOG???<br /><br />I saw potential for a hopeful ending. That was when the kid found a beetle. Finding a bug would seem to indicate life. If there's insects, then plants are to be found, somewhere... But this movie never ran with that.<br /><br />The ending just left me feeling really hollow. Everything that came before, wasted. For all we know, the kid dies the next day. Hello? There's still NO FOOD.<br /><br />So how to rate this movie? I don't know. I give up. The acting is top-notch. Absolutely superb. Viggo Mortensen is one of the best actors I have ever seen. His performance here is so believable that it lends a lot of authenticity to the story, regardless. He really looks like he is starving. Kodi Smit-McPhee as the kid did a good job, too. Also, I was very happy to see Guy Pierce, as always.<br /><br />So for the acting and production values alone, I give it 5 Stars.<br /><br />For the story, I have no idea.<br /><br />Until the sun goes supernova, life on Earth will continue. The only problem is, will humans still be around to see it?
B006KX3GXO|5.0|so flexible and full of different effect and collages choices. it makes my pics look so much better. i specially like the different paper options, the stickers and the many backgrounds and collage options.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Great game. Highly recommend! Excellent graphics and sound. Hard not to play for hours on end. Keeps you motivated and engaged. Our whole family is hooked!
030758836X|3.0|A beautiful woman is snared by a young man who can't believe his good fortune.  She is well off and adores him. What can be better? Both are writers living in New York but they lose their jobs. In addition, the woman's parents become financially bereft and ask their daughter to borrow her money. Poor, they use the last of her money to buy a bar in his hometown which is run by her husband and his twin sister.<br /><br />Amy Elliott Dunne has another side to her personality that Nick Dunne is about to discover as the ideal marriage that he thought he had begins to fall apart. When Amy disappears Nick is believed to be the cause of her disappearance.<br /><br />Did he murder his beloved wife? Nick knows he didn't but all signs point to that conclusion. The police believe he is responsible for her absence. Her parents, who stand by him in the beginning, arrive at the same belief. The public and the media are likewise convinced.  He wonders if even his twin sister believes it as well. Before the reader discovers the truth, the reader becomes wrapped up in endless detail.<br /><br />This is a thriller that does keep one turning the pages but it roars to a pallid conclusion. I liked it but thought that someone should have spent more time editing as details are presented again and again.  I know many others will like this read but I was disappointed.
0062119044|5.0|The story was incredibly interesting from the very beginning, the fact that it is written as correspondence makes the reader feel as if one is snooping through someone's mail who seems to have a juicy story to tell.<br /><br />Through out the whole book there is great insight into the pressure of expectations for all women to yearn for motherhood. It brings light to the fact that a woman who doesn't have a life plan where children are included is seen as cold and selfish, a complete double standard to to men who choose not to have children. Through out the book there are many instances where the author exemplifies the gender bias such as the woman being the one who is expected to put her career on hold (or sometimes resign all together) and the men are not only allowed but expected to continue their career as before. Even when the scenario is described of Eva going out of town and Franklin having a problem with her independence it is clear as day that if the roles were switched the man wouldn't be seen as a selfish husband and instead the woman would be perceived as a needy and clingy wife.<br /><br />It also nicely elaborates on the reputation and culture of the United States versus the rest of the world in a clear and non-derogatory manner, showing even if most of us have a cultural bias either for or against the \\"American way\\" there are good and bad things to both points of view.<br /><br />It definitely was a dark story but it's not as if the reader doesn't know that when they pick it up, some of us actually have an interest in this genre so it is my opinion that squeamish people shouldn't complain too much when they run across something that is tough to read.<br /><br />I am a big fan of psychology and trying to understand what goes through someone's mind when they are capable of such atrocities and even though we didn't actually get a clear view into Kevin's mind I found it extremely compelling to hear a mother's point of view. It makes you think about how helpless a parent can be sometimes in trying to relate to a child who has no interest in relating.<br /><br />I happened to have watched an interview of Jeffery Dahmer a few days before reading this and the book I finished before that was Prozac Nation and I must say those two added another layer to the perplexing mind of a person like Kevin. It seems Dahmer's parents were nothing if not loving, \\"normal\\" parents and he flat out explains those homicidal thoughts always lurked in the back of his mind. Prozac Nation's influence came from the fact that Elizabeth (author, non fiction) never really got the point of living, everything was pretty pointless, much like the way Kevin's outlook came off from the very beginning starting with the game Eva tried to play with him and the ball. It must be so frustrating for people who don't think/feel like the rest of us and instead of wanting to live life to the fullest simply don't see the point when it is all going to end anyway. The book also touched on the availability of Prozac which again resonated of Prozac Nation.<br /><br />I guess if you are like me and have an interest in the psyche behind people who's way of thinking allows them to act in unfathomable ways, I recommend all three, they served as pieces to a puzzle, which helped me relate better to all three.<br />Moreover on
B0086700CM|5.0|i have been wanting temple run on kindle fire soo bad and when i checked to see if they had it they did! so now i play it nonstop its soo addicting!

B005LAIGZU|5.0|Fantastic movie that makes one think about the sacrifices that are made by the military.  Amazing realistic action and makes you proud to be an american.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Nice to read another book from the viewpoint of the dog.  I do not own dogs, am a cat person, but reading this makes me want to go to the nearest shelter and get one.  Loved the story, not difficult and great for summer light reading.  Highly recommend for grabbing your interest from page 1, and taking you on a nice ride.  Enjoy!
B0015F1VY8|5.0|Stage settings and costumes were excellent, transporting me into the very location as an observer.<br />The richness and the passion proved to be entirely believable.

B0079XPUOW|5.0|First off, John you did not disappoint me with this latest novel of yours. I got the first chapters as a free offer last week on Kindle, and when I purchased the book the day of its release, the book started right were the complementary chapters ended. Nicely done. More authors might want to consider this tactic as there was no way after getting completely hooked into the plot,  that I was not going to buy the book.<br />As a avid reader of Science Fiction and fantasy novels, I have to say<br />Red Shirts really kept me intrigued and smiling as I read it. In a couple of places I laughed out loud. Its clever, amusing, and thought provoking,.<br />I can see how it would translate into a good film  and I would go see it as a film in a heart beat..<br />My kindle has made me an insatiable reader. I  discovered Mr. Scalzi's novels 10 days ago and have read them all. This latest release ties in more to me with Agent to the Stars than say A war for Old Men though I love both books.<br />There was an experience of  déjà vue  relating to conversations I have had over the years  with my adult kids regarding some of the scenarios on Star Trek, which brought out arguments that could on for days. When  I read similar comparisons in Red Shirts if made me smile thinking that we were not alone in the universes with these weightier observations. Did I mention Red Shirts is a marvelous  book? If felt short,but that is perhaps because I had already completed 4 chapters......<br /> A handy feature on Kindle is that there is an instant  dictionary accessible with the tap of a finger as one reads. In my last 150 books it is rare I come across a word that a would want to look up, but Mr.Scalzi;s books have averaged 3 words a novel that  prompted me to use this feature.<br />I have to conclude the reason I will look forward to buying new novels by John Scalzi, is that regardless were the story takes me, I know that I will be happily drawn into the to plot, and surprised and consumed  totally with his innovative writing  style. This can only happen when one reads a  book from an author who is really really smart.
B0086700CM|1.0|i love temple run and all but while playing it it glitches and makes you die i have died numerously because of this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As a flight attendant - there are many short breaks that are best filled reading a good book - with the kindle, its even easier since i don't have to lug all those books. Reading the hunger games was fun to read and gave me that mental break from dealing w/ all those passengers :)
B0028MBKVG|5.0|...book I've read in a long time. I finished it, turned to page one, and started reading again. I have run off and on over the years, but had never run more than 10 miles before reading this book. Now I am running barefoot and training for my first ultra-marathon, logging 40-50 miles a week. If you are looking for inspiration to run more, this is your book. If you want to inspire a friend (I bought a copy for our school library), this makes a great gift.
B007C4ZJ3K|2.0|just not enjoyable at all. alot of scenes could have been shortened, so much long silences. only thing that was descent was the fighting, but even thaT looked too choreographed. and i just didnt believe her as an actress. best she sticks to MMA.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best game I have ever played who ever thought of this game was a genus. hope all u out there like it too

B006Z7Z3S6|2.0|Very slow moving film. To say it is boring, is kind. Great premise, but horrible execution. It's almost like they took useless scenes that any other director would cut out and discard, but this film is as if most of it is composed of scenes that should have been tossed out. They add very little to the story.  Many of the potential plot points are barely developed. If this was a Film School assignment, I would give it just a C for at least keeping the camera in focus; the rest would get a D.<br /><br />I would avoid this one unless you have nothing better to do than waste the time.<br /><br />I know there are those who will be all angsty about negative reviews like this. That's OK. Not everyone agrees with Ebert all the time either. Let's keep this in perspective: I think most will agree the film is not of the caliber of Dracula, Halloween, Carry, Elm Street, The Shining, or similar 'films'.  It's a B movie at best - something worth a watch on a Saturday afternoon TV movie. Most video games are more entertaining. Do yourself a favor - watch a good horror movie. It could also tell you something when they have this DVD marked down to $10 at some retail outlets. Even Amazon has it half price.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Great follow up to the first season, will not disappoint fans of the Sword of Truth books or people new to the series.
B0053VKP8S|1.0|This piece of hardware is absolutely horrible. I have a pair of high end THX certified speakers, and as soon I ran some audio through this converter plugged into the speakers, they sounded like I paid $5 for them. The audio distortion is incredibly high, the treble sounds like it's been taken down -20db, and the low end sounds muddy. Don't buy this item.
0345803485|5.0|I do not normally like fiction books at all and every time a friend tries to shove the latest and greatest book down my throat (ie Harry Potter, Twilight, Hunger Games), I try really hard but CANNOT get into it at all. This book threw me for a major loop. So maybe the writing isn't the highest of quality and being from Seattle, it was quite obvious the author is not from the area, but I have never experienced such obsession with a book in my life! While the sexual scenes were shocking at times, the way they were written were not too graphic to handle. I just love the characters and am so intrigued with the story. Five stars from me!
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I liked the movie Heath and Jake had good chemistry, i would like to see more of Jake in the future gay movies, unfortunately Heath is not around now.
0345803493|5.0|So I admit I was completely obsessed with the first book but I had my doubts that the second could be better.. well it was. The story line really thickened and there were so many unpredicted events in this one. Yes, maybe some of the same lines were repeated over and over but that did not stop me from finishing it in less than 3 days. Loved it! Now on to the third.. we will see how this goes!
B0034G4P4O|2.0|I have found this to be a common theme among most of the computer animated movies nowadays.  Speilbergs TinTin is no exeption.  Here we have some of the most stunning animation ever put on film that is frustratingly wasted on a mediocre story.  I found the whole expeirence to be a confusing mess.  There were never any genuinely funny moments,  (though it tries and flops),  and the over use of action sequences just became tedious after a while.  Its amazing that a master storyteller like Steven Speiberg could deliver to misfires in one year, War Horse being the other.
B0079KGAOY|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />It's hard to believe but it's been 25 years since the first Lethal Weapon appeared at the theatre. In my opinion, watching the Blu Ray today, shows it's held up well. This is the director's cut with seven additional minutes, most of which shows the difference between Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover). Murtaugh has been with the Los Angeles Police Department since 1967 and is contemplating retirement. That's when he meets Riggs. Riggs joined the Army at 19, became a member of the Special Forces, then was an assassin for the C.I.A. which explains the rouge aspects of his character. He often defends his love of weapons and hand-to-hand combat by saying, \\" ... the only thing I was really good at.\\" The difference in the two men is ultimately one of the reasons the guys become such good friends.<br />Relive all the adventures from the epic fight between Riggs and Joshua (Gary Busey) in Murtaugh's front yard; Lethal Weapon 2 where more comedy is added to the action/adventure series introducing federal witness Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), who joins the boys to capture millions in drug money; Lethal Weapon 3 in which our heroes battle a crooked ex-cop who's become an arms dealer to the L.A. street gangs and finally Lethal Weapon 4 finds Riggs going to marry Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), Murtaugh reluctantly meeting his future son-in-law Det. Lee Butters (Chris Rock). Murtaugh stubbles upon a Chinese immigrant smuggling ring. Riggs finale fight with Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li) is worth the cost of the DVD.<br />Rumors come and go about a Lethal Weapon 5. In a 2011 interview Glover, then 64, went into his Murtaugh character and said, \\"I'm too old for this!\\"
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|this app is awesome! my dad loves it because he had atari as a kid. it is an amazing app!
B003Y5H5F6|1.0|I found this release to have no continuity with the previous releases if this was to be a continuation as there was not enough back story.  I have been a fan of this franchise, but with this release, I think is has fizzled out.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome. when it came out on the ipod i loved it im so excited the kindle finally has it. I could play it all day but my parents would get mad. it has good graphics.:) :p
0393927938|5.0|I am thoroughly impressed with this edition of Frankenstein. Not only does it include the 1818 edition of Frankenstein, it contains the original 1818 introduction by Percy Bysshe Shelley and the 1831 introduction by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. This edition contains a very nice collection of critical essays. Many of the critical essays focus on feminist readings of Frankenstein, but other readings are represented as well (New Historicism, Intertextual Criticism, Media & Cultural Studies, etc.). This is a fine volume for students looking to delve a little deeper into Frankenstein and the imaginative forces behind it.
B004AM5QT4|3.0|He's written some great books and I've read many, but I thought this was a little pat.  The characters were predictable - the strong female, younger sexy man, devious vain older man with a right wing world view, lots of feminist terminology.  In other words, the characters were not that developed or interesting.  But, the story line was very interesting and there were lots of twists and turns in the thriller to engage the reader and encourage them to finish the book.  I took it to the beach, enjoyed some reading before bedtime and would say if you want a book to take on a vacation or pick up at your leisure, you should enjoy it.

B0084IG7KC|1.0|Simply put, this fad (and yes it is a fad) is full of holes, teen angst/drama, and ignores the opportunities avaliable to it to make it a great premis.

B000007T1M|5.0|You know, I'm not as big of a fan of SOAD as I used to be. Everything since \\"Steal This Album!\\" hasn't really been anything worth noting and even both \\"Toxicity\\" and STA were average at best besides a few songs from each. But one thing is for certain, and that's their self-titled album will always be an all killer, no filler monster of an album that any true appreciator of music should own.<br /><br />The album starts off innocent enough: a fun metal tune known as \\"Suite-Pee.\\" But when Serj unleashes that almost demonic growl, that scream of \\"DIE!\\" you know this album is serious business. And for its 40 minute onslaught, you're met with some of the most unique lyricism and vocal delivery you will possibly ever hear in an album. And the crushing music is just the icing on this nice little piece of cake. Even when the album slows down a little with \\"Spiders\\" and \\"Mind,\\" you still find yourself wanting to bob your head to the music a little (this album provides some good pacing, might I add).<br /><br />Overall, \\"System of a Down\\" is a fun little gem that every metal fan should own. It provides the crushing music, the insane death growls (that surprisingly we never heard from again after this album), and the lyricism that every metal album should have. It's definitely recommended if you haven't checked this album out yet.<br /><br />Highlights: \\"Suite-Pee,\\" \\"Sugar,\\" \\"DDevil,\\" \\"Mind,\\" and \\"Darts.\\"
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Most enjoyable!  From the first pages, I couldn't put it down.  So well written that I felt as if I were watching a movie.  I found myself holding my breath in anticipation, laughing, and then found tears in my eyes.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|----------------------------------------<br />Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />Bought this from FYE for 15.99, they were having a special sale on it.  I have been looking forward to seeing this for some time.  Ever since I saw the original 'Underworld' and 'Underworld: Evolution' years ago I have been a fan.<br /><br />Well...this one fell short, hard.  For starters, Scott Speedman did not return as Michael.  There was an extremely brief scene with \\"Michael\\" but the person was obviously not Speedman.  But this was only the beginning of the confusions for me.<br /><br />**Spoilers Ahead/And a lot of Confusion**<br /><br />For starters...how did we the humans find out about the vampires and lycans?  Why did a silver grenade have an effect on Michael?  Why did an ultraviolet blast stun Selene?  Was Selene pregnant, where did that hybrid child (her daughter) come from?  Why was Selene frozen for 12 years?  Why was she freed by that human, or did her daughter free her?  Speaking of her daughter, why did the lycans create her?  How could that guy become such a HUGE lycan?  I mean he was IMPOSSIBLY huge.  Are there any vampires left besides that one covern?  Where is this franchise going?<br /><br />Whew.  Simply put I was stammered while watching this movie.  Don't get me wrong, it is action packed and has Selene kicking some serious ass.  She is definitely a hard-core chick who can take care of herself.  Unfortunately action and Beckinsale's hot looks are not enough to save this film.<br /><br />Is this franchise dead?  No.  It could still be turned around, but the next film needs to be OUTSTANDING.  It needs story, well developed characters, and the return of Scott Speedman.  Here's an interesting concept for the next film, have the next one set 100 years in the future.  Then we could have a lot of cool sci fi elements in it, i.e. flying cars and laser guns.  Just a thought.<br /><br />Is this worth buying?  Only if you are a die hard fan (like me) of this series.  BUT...buy this one cheap, it's not worth a lot.  It will no doubt go on sale very soon, wait and get it cheaply.  I could and probably should delve more into the film for this review, but in all honestly I would need to watch this a 2nd time to give it a fair shake.  Right now I don't want to watch it again, 'Prometheus' is calling me.  Here's hoping that it doesn't suck...<br /><br />Well that's my 2 cents worth, got to go, nightshift at my job is awaiting me.  I feel like a vampire some times...oncept for the next film, have the next one set 100 years in the future.  Then we could have a lot of cool sci fi elements in it, i.e. flying cars and laser guns.  Just a thought.<br /><br />Is this worth buying?  Only if you are a die hard fan (like me) of this series.  BUT...buy this one cheap, it's not worth a lot.

0142421375|2.0|I've now read two of the Theodore Boone books. I've long been a Grisham fan, and some of his insights into people and the ways they behave have been profound. His writing was always simple and straight-forward. These two books, however, are clunky. The characters are flat, and the writing is clumsy. The basic line of the story is sound; it's just the execution that fails. There are quite a few writers whose work needs relatively intense editing. Maybe Grisham is one of those, and he lost his long-time editor. Whatever may be going on, it's sad to see a writer lose his touch.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run so much it is so cool I wish I could meet the inventor of the game.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game will certainly tax your brain, Although a lot of it is luck there are strategies that will help in beating this monster on occasion.<br /><br />Have fun, Don
0785814531|5.0|IS  AN EXCELLENT BOOK , IT HAS AN UNDERSTANDABLE LYRICS, DESPITE THAT IN OTHER COMMENTS SAID THAT THE LETTER WAS VERY SMALL, IS ADEQUATE, VERY GOOD SIZE, VERY GOOD PROTECTION, CAME IN VERY GOOD CONDITION, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO PURCHASE
B0079J28NW|4.0|While I am not a great fan of the film itself, it is still an eye-opening return to the 1960s of Peter Max (and would have been a lot more fun if the Beatles had contributed their voices to the dialogue sections).<br /><br />The picture has been beautifully restored by hand, frame by frame.  The colors are amazing!!!<br /><br />The audio is stirring! The first thing you notice about the 5.1 track is how clean it is.  The only other time I have come across such great audio on Beatles' songs was with the DVD soundtrack accompanying the CD of The Beatles Love (Cirque du Soleil).<br /><br />The special features on the disc are an odd assortment.  There are some pencil drawings, storyboard sequences, some behind-the-scene photos of the Beatles, a feature-length commentary, and  a few other extras.  The odd part of the extras section are the video interviews with some of the voice talent and other people involved in the production.  For some reason, most only run about a minute.  Why they limited it to that short a length is a puzzle.<br /><br />The Blu disc is in one-half of a folder.  The other half is a pocket containing four repro film cels of the Beatles ( a neat item). There is also a small sheet of 10 decals.  A nice item in the pouch is a sixteen-page booklet with photos, drawings, and text (regretably, the text is so tiny that it makes a contract's \\"small print\\" look enormous in comparison.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B005HSL626|5.0|its like the full version but only free even though there is ads its still cool so stop complaining everyone
0345803485|1.0|I kept hanging in there, thinking it had to get better. It never did. This book really sucks, much like Anastasia. I can't believe all the recommendations for this book. I finished the Hunger Games series and this book was suggested to people who liked the Hunger Games. Why????? There is no plot, no adventure, no mystery. Just a lot of repetitive, childish writing about a pervert stalker and a stupid chick. Seriously, watch a porno. The writing will be 100 times better.
0345803485|1.0|Every single woman I come into contact with...friends, coworkers, etc have been raving about how terrific this book is, how they just can't put it down, so I realize I'm probably in the minority when I say this book is a snoozefest to say the least. Nothing happens besides the main character having sex, constantly, in graphic descriptions which are titallating the first couple of times, boring and redundant the last ninety or so. There's no plot or character development. All the characters are one dimensional and have absolutely no personality. Seriously, a Sweet Valley High book is a more satisfying read. The sex scenes are completely unrealistic...(slight spoilers) the heroine orgasms while losing her virginity and goes on to have sex two or three more times in the ensuing hours. Orgasming each time. Yeah, right. Basically this is the literary equivalent of a porno. Plastic perfect cosmetically enhanced people that resemble mannequins having sex for hours. About as exciting as watching paint dry. And the funny thing is, I stated I have spoilers, but there's really not anything to spoil because absolutely nothing happens. They have sex, more sex, and after that even more sex.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|notifications don't work on  Kindle. will have to find a timer app or something so i don't keep losing my food!
0345803485|5.0|I was very impressed on how quickly my purchase arrived! Very nicely packaged and in perfect condition. The book's very good so far...on chapter 18. Not for sensitive readers as it is extremely explicit.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's pretty good, though some of the games are kinda hard. If I could rate it 4.5 I would have. But over all it's a pretty good game. Some of the games are really hard so if you don't like to lose (like my brother)  this is NOT a good game for you. It's got a good variety of games, too.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|The story is nice. Not so fast-paced as the first, but still good. I recomend it specially for fantasy stories fans.
B0086700CM|4.0|i think its pretty cool. i just wish it would give u more than one life in each run. so hard not to die when u first start playing.  but its funn!!!! download! !!'

0783226888|4.0|I own the Frederick Forysythe novel, the 1973(?) film on DVD, and now this DVD (having seen it on satellite TV recently, I liked it enough to make it part of my collection).<br /><br />Without a doubt, the original is better.  But that doesn't mean this film is a stinker.<br /><br />This film is a VERY loose remake of the original, NOT a modernization.  The main storyline has changed ENTIRELY, so don't expect it to appear.  But many elements from the original novel/movie DO make it into this remake: those who hired the Jackal holed up in a hotel, the kidnapping and torture of their courier to learn what's going on, the Jackal's use of multiple identities and disguises, the Jackal's changing his vehicle's color, one person who supplies the Jackal wants more money and is eliminated, etc.  All these come to mind as I type; I'm sure there are some that I'm forgetting.<br /><br />The remake is good, but not great.  There's more shoot'em'up and less intrigue than the original novel/movie.  While I don't think the shoot'em'up was overdone (the goal of the Jackal in the remake was to make a VERY public statement, not shoot a single sniper's bullet and then disappear as in the original), I do believe it was too short on the intrigue aspect of the original.<br /><br />This remake works for me.  I'm happy to add it to my collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely loved this game on the iPod and now it's on my kindle! yayyyyy!!!!!! I love to play it and try to win coins and power ups. its so fun and definitely worth buying.
B00884GR0W|3.0|well... the controls aren't great... its good though... if u want a game like minecraft its good... it will take sometime to get used to the controls buts its good..
B005721W9O|4.0|I like Star Trek and my spouse doesn't, but we both thought this movie was very funny. As long as you have an understanding of how Star Trek is and can sit through an episode, then watch this movie. If you hate Star Trek with a passion, then skip it.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|ok this game is annoying whenever it gives me money or diamonds for completing something it will b there and ill look back and it disepears also it randomly takes money from me its so not fair!!!
B002PMPTIO|3.0|MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br /><br />I had really hoped to see more of the Academy years with the characters we're all familiar with before having them go on a space mission. I actually liked that it wasn't a remake of the pilot episode of Star Trek. The relationship between Spock and Uhura was interesting. The tie ins such as the Kobayashi Maru test and Kirk's allergy were nice to see. The action scenes were good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it fell back to the problems of other Star Trek movies. It spends too much time on a new character/s. The villain comes across as silly and ineffective as a truly threatening menace. The writers couldn't come up with better terminology for an important element of the story, calling it \\"the red matter.\\" It seemed to be copying Star Wars in certain parts. Some scenes are hokey; some, illogical.<br /><br />However, if you like Star Trek, definitely rent it. It's entertaining. Then decide whether or not you'd like to own it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. I thought at first this game would be stupid. Once I started playing I just couldn't stop. There are some glitches though like it freezes up ALOT. But gosh I love this game &lt;3
B0010T0OCY|4.0|MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br /><br />It's intriguing to watch the nostalgic city transform and its citizens switch roles. William Hurt's performance is spot on. The sci-fi part of the story is okay, and Kiefer Sutherland's speaking is a bit distracting, but all in all Dark City is entertaining.<br /><br />Caveat: It does have one rather graphic murder scene and some nudity.<br /><br />***Mild spoiler***<br /><br />My favorite scene is between Bumstead and Walenski: \\"My wife? She's not my wife. I don't know who she is. I don't know who any of us are.\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is so addicting and I played it for like 2 hours straight. love it! I had this app on my opossum and I was really hoping I could get it on my kindle and I was! Yay!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Everything I need fits in this bag. I  love how you can detach compartments when you don't need them, or you just need the space. Very comfortable on my shoulders! I can even fit my 13' Mac Book Pro in the bag.<br /><br />Thank Amazon!
B0086700CM|5.0|Great- except for the prices of some new characters. In my opinion, 25000 coins is a bit much for a character. Other than that,  its great!
B0086700CM|5.0|nice graphics.  easy to controls the sliding,  jumping,  turning,  and tilting. you get to choose your character. this app is sooooooooo amazing.
B004I744AS|5.0|it was just what I needed. when you click on the app it gives you the word of the day and other things but at the top there is a place where you can type in the word u want to search, and several definitions come up.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As a \\"non-vanilla\\" person I looked forward to reading this trilogy. What a disappointment! The characters are cookie cut-outs, perfect and yet perfectly imperfect. Of course, poor Christian (how did that name get picked?) is a pervert who more or less sees the light at the end of the tunnel and is pretty much \\"cured of his affliction.\\" The sex scenes are limp after a few hot ones and the story just repeats over and over. And I wish I could have spanked Anastasia's (where did that name come from?) inner goddess who showed up way too often. I hate romance novels guised in BDSM clothing.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Great Movie!  Would highly recommend this movie to any fan of the genre.  Don't believe the terrible \\"professional\\" reviews.  This movie received some bad press because it had a bad opening weekend at the box office due to terrible marketing.  You won't be disappointed with John Carter From Mars!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are ok but I mean to many adds! I think it's stupid you have you unlock the games it's not worth it.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|Like reading a Batman movie............. To much Super Hero stuff, it kept detailing Hawk over and over. Got to be a bit boring.
B0076OV7F0|5.0|Lana Del Rey from the United States is able to hold her own with the great young British singers of today.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books!  I finished this one and moved on to the third in the series.  It is my guilty pleasure.  The stories focus on the under=lying emotional ties between the characters so don't be put off by the hype associated with the books.  They are a thoroughly enjoyable read!
B007Q1VUFA|4.0|Upon hearing about Chris Robinson's latest project with the Chris Robinson Brotherhood, I was very interested to see how this new album would sound. I had already heard some stuff from a recent live show, so I knew to expect good things.<br /><br />What I didn't expect was such a beautiful, fluid, easy-going album. Big Moon Ritual is such a joy to listen to. Robinson's soul-filled vocals sound right at home on this 7 song album.<br /><br />I can't really pick out a magic moment right now because everything just blends so nice nicely together. Whether it's the awesome Jerry-evoking guitar by Neal Casal or even the excellent keyboard playing from Adam MacDougall (already outstanding in his own right in The Black Crowes btw!), I was just absolutely impressed with how tight a band Robinson assembled.<br /><br />Speaking of the keys, Macdougall really does shine throughout the album - even evoking 70's studs like Richard Wright and John Paul Jones in the process. From the funky \\"Rosalee\\", the sprawling middle of the album opus \\"Star or Stone\\", to the country-tinged \\"100 Days of Rain\\", MacDougall nearly steals the show. But like I said, it is a total band effort on this one all around as one must also give props to the solid foundation put down by drummer George Sluppick who even has me thinking of Mick Fleetwood during the Peter Green era on \\"Tomorrow Blues\\".<br /><br />Perfect album to listen to watching that sun go down in the west on a Friday, beer in hand, long week of work slipping behind in the rearview mirror. Very, very, very impressive stuff here. Do yourself a favor and get this one, now.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I give this movie 7 out of 10. Plot well it was ok the 3d effect were pretty good.I guess is good to have the movie because it help you undderstand the avenger movie better.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love the game its so addicting it will glitch sometimes but I still cant figure out how to work the cheat. ;) still an awesome game
B0086700CM|5.0|its a cool app I like how if you die there is a picture and a reason really fun app and really addictding
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great games i like the fact that theres so many different games. variety is great. im stuck on 101-1-Games. you gotta try it.
0345803485|2.0|I can only come to the conclusion that most readers who rate this book highly don't read a lot of BDSM and found it fun and kinky. The writing is ridiculous. I read the whole thing, despite losing interest early, because I wanted to review it, and I feel it's fairer to write reviews based on the whole books. This book is written in first person, of which I'm not a big fan, but that isn't what keeps it from being a good book.<br /><br />The plot and scenarios have all been captured by other reviews, so I'm just giving my opinions, rather than telling readers what they read on the book description page and in other reviews. Some of the readers posted the number of times certain words and phrases appeared in the novel, apparently a cool thing you can do with a Kindle (I want a Kindle Fire!). I haven't tried to count words and phrases, but I started rolling my eyes like Anastasia when I noticed the redundancies.<br /><br />Ana and Christian are constantly shocking each other, frequently gasping and murmuring and whispering. For some reason, they can admit truths by whispering them, and there are lots of these admissions, which is unrealistic. If a person has difficulty admitting something, they usually can't say it at all.<br /><br />Ana constantly speaks of her subconscious and \\"inner goddess.\\" I will admit that I grew to like the inner goddess character somewhat, but it's hard to believe a character who's supposed to be a bit of a wallflower and introverted acknowledges a goddess within; usually, it's stronger women who find this persona.<br /><br />I think there's only once in this whole novel when the heroine is hungry. She constantly has a loss of appetite, and Christian insists she eats. I'm surprised she isn't anorexic. What she is, is boring. There's lots of blushing and even more so, flushing, and I don't mean a toilet. Characters are constantly turning shades of red for one reason or another.<br /><br />Christian buys Ana a computer, which for most of the book, she can't simply call it that. Instead, she refers to it as the \\"mean machine.\\" It just seems silly to me. However, some of the emails were amusing. Indeed, I found some humor, albeit not much.<br /><br />I was surprised by the ending, because I'm used to reading romances and erotica that tend to be formulaic. It was refreshing; too bad the rest of the book isn't. I don't intend to read the sequels, although I admit to a small curiosity of the continuation of Ana and Christian's relationship., she can't simply call it that.

0307477401|5.0|I needn't sing the praises of Henning Mankell as a storyteller or literary novelist. He has, however, matured remarkably in this beautiful crime thriller, rooted in family and mired in government malfeasance.<br /><br />His protagonist, Kurt Wallander and daughter, Linda, have never been better. The tipping point occurs in the way the tale is structured and voice of the narrator. Wallander has turned 60 -- not old by most standards; however Mankell knows how many government and corporate entities have consigned this demographic to the waste bin. Therein lies the irresistible appeal of this literary crime work. Plot, theme and character meld.<br /><br />The plot launches on the disappearance of Wallander's father-in-law, a tried-and-true sub captain and member of the Swedish navy.Naturally, one suspects foul play for good reason. I will not divulge more, only say that the lost victim is much older than Wallander and his wife, and that the dynamics between Linda and her father dovetail beautifully with the plot.<br /><br />There are ample twists and turns to satisfy the genre enthusiast; but the literary skills of the author, and his compassion for the aging, are sensational and spot-on.<br /><br />It is an irresistible read. I can pick it up at any point, in any environment, and become immersed in both character and action.<br /><br />I have read many fussy reviews of books by gifted writers in this genre, but I put up my dukes for this one, and especially for this book.  Mankell lulls the reader with his prose, teaches history (as always) when he writes, and suggests goodness will overcome evil in the end. BUT he does so in a way which is plausible within the canon of modern fiction, and also in tandem with all we know to be right.  Five powerful stars.  You will read it and recommend it and loan it and gift it.<br /><br />This is one wonderful, compassionate book, written by a master.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|REASON FOR BOOK CHOICE<br /><br />I am an aggressive reader now, for sure, but I didn't used to be. As such I found out about Hunger Games via a trailer on Apple.com. It looked intriguing and the main character had a lean and angry feel to her that I hadn't seen in a while. I like kick ass female heroines and the story seemed to tick all my desirability boxes.<br /><br />Then a few reviewers said the movie wasn't as great as it could be, so I passed and decided to wait for the DVD release. However, a couple of weeks ago I was trawling for a good book and I thought: Hunger Games, why not? I'm currently writing my own YA book and I thought that I should be pragmatic and check out the competition. I didn't expect it to be good, I certainly expect it to be great. It was just the new Twilight that I had to read because the world demanded it.<br /><br />COVER<br /><br />The cover for the Kindle version I purchased is the movie tie-in edition. I'm not sure what to think of that. I know that keeping your marketing material the same is a good idea, but would it be such an ask to have a unique Kindle cover that really takes advantage of its grey scale processing? We're not talking a single independent writer here, this is a professional squad. Surely they could design something that grabs you straight off from the get go.<br /><br />The cover itself is fine. It's Katniss' mockingbird on fire and I already knew it looked great in print at the local bookshop. In greyscale, however, not so much. All the vividness and contrast has been drained out of the picture; therefore, even though it's in super high definition, it doesn't grab me on the Kindle.<br /><br />It's also strange that the cover suffers from the 'blank space' issue a lot of books have around its left and right sides. I went off at Alan Parr last week about and I haven't changed my opinion. This is really lazy work and whoever put the book together for the Kindle should be spoken to about it. Yes, they would have to modify the file but it would be worth it.<br /><br />BOOK LAYOUT<br /><br />Even though the book still starts right into the novel (please, can we not do that?), I found it had all the essentials: TOC, chapter headings, acknowledgments and a really great way of promoting the next book. Unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan of the way the TOC had been laid out and although I understand it's not the Kindle version creator's fault (because he / she was staying true to the source material) it really reeks of sloppiness.<br /><br />I can comprehend that fans of the novel would want it changed as little as possible from one version to another, but I'm not sure they would complain about aesthetic changes like chapter headings. I say this because the TOC chapter listings are 1, 2, 3 and so on. It works when you create a printed book because you can make those numbers really large but as TOC headings, it looks like an eighth grader put the table of contents together. Surely they could have changed them to One, Two, Three and kept the spirit of the book.<br /><br />One thing I love about the layout is their marketing. At the very end of the novel is a picture promoting the new novel: Catching Fire, and it's great. It let's you know that the other book is available, what it's called and it's not trying to force you to read anymore. I'm already thinking for picking it up in the Christmas period (or when I have holidays) to add to my list of reading material.<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />The story is pretty well known by now: Katniss has voluntarily put herself forward to compete in the Hunger Games so that she can save her sister from a likely death. This games are a survival tournament between the 12 different districts that is held in the Capitol and features participants from the ages of 13 (?) to 18.<br /><br />The main story: survival, is added to with the possibility of romance, audience manipulation and defiance against an oppressive regime. I loved it. I really loved it. Thestory arc is tightly wound and just goes up and up in its tension as the book progresses.<br /><br />I found Suzanne Collins totally ruthless as an author (for this kind of book she needs to be) and that was overwhelmingly refreshing for me as a reader. No-one is spared. Friendships are made because of the need to survive and then characters are dispatched as if the Hunger Games was happening in reality right now. There's no sentimentality in this book or inauthentic moments and that's what makes the story work because it feels as if you're right there every step of the way with Katniss and the other competitors.<br /><br />Also, the book ends. The Hunger Games end and that makes it a compelling (and fulfilling) read.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've read characters who I've cared about so deeply. I love Katniss and her strength, her confusion, her struggle with humanity versus survival. It's powerful, it's evocative and it made my heart jump more than once. She's a character that hasn't just turned up with a bow because that's what the author wants, she's a character who grew to use a bow because of her fierce determination to survive. I feel that things are going to go badly for her in the next two novels but you can't help but hope she makes it somehow.<br /><br />There's a great mentor in Haymitch who I hope will be fleshed out more in the second book, a complex and volatile love interest in Peeta, an uncertain ally in Cinna and a fascinating interviewer in Caesar. I think what I loved about all these characters was the fact that they arrive as real people. They have histories, secrets and their own goals Suzanne hasn't told us about yet. Nothing feels deliberately hidden in the book but you can feel it lurking beneath the surface and just waiting to explode.<br /><br />I think Cinna was probably my favourite outside of Katniss and I'm looking forward to seeing if he gets more space in the next novel.<br /><br />WRITING<br /><br />Wow. This is incredibly written. The end of the book says that Suzanne Collins explores the effects of war in her novels and you can feel that. She writes with a purpose and drive that I did not feel in Twilight or Switched. Everything feels stripped back, every word feels as if it should belong on the page and there's no fancy literary games to be played with the author. I felt as if Katniss was speaking to me directly all the way through.<br /><br />It's written in the first person perspective and in the present tense. I think the narrator is a little unreliable (she's only 18) but has a unique and strong voice that you can hear in each sentence on the page. After reading the big ones: Switched and Twilight, I'm pretty comfortable saying this is in a whole different league. There was nothing wrong with Stephanie Meyer or Amanda Hocking's writing ability in those books, but they were not at this level. Not this gripping, not with this strength of tone and force behind each word. It was like being kicked in the teeth and then pulled behind a chariot for three thousand metres.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Is it worth five dollars? Yes. Hell yes.<br /><br />I can't tell you how much of a relief it was for me to read Hunger Games. I really struggled through the last two books and thought that maybe I had lost my ability to enjoy well written novels because I was writing more myself. I wasn't. The last two books just weren't that good.<br /><br />Hunger Games grabbed me from the first page and held me until its bittersweet end. I started it at ten o'clock at night and finished the novel the next morning. It's about 80,000 words but it didn't feel like it. It felt so much smaller than the other two novels I had just read. I loved Hunger Games and it made me believe that there was some more Young Adult fiction out there for me.<br /><br />You don't need to like YA to enjoy Hunger Games, you don't need to like vampires, love torn women or any of the tropes of the genre. This is fiction at its finest with an immediacy that would have made George Orwell proud.<br /><br />--------------<br />Disagree? Think it's not that great? Believe I'm being too kind? Too harsh?

B0038QGXHW|4.0|This is about the most laid back Keith Jarrett I have heard.  And yes those are words that you don't normally associate with Keith Jarrett.<br /><br />This is a set of very austerely played jazz standards.  Just the bare bones melodies, no brilliant solos, no fire in the belly.  Frankly, it seems to me this album works best for background music.<br /><br />Today I listened to several other Jarrett recordings- two orchestral (Arbour Zena and Celestial Hawk) and one with DeJohnette et al (Whisper Not).<br /><br />I loved all of those.  This one paled in comparison.<br /><br />It is quite possible I am missing something.  This album has absolutely stellar reviews and on other Jarrett recordings with such good reviews I have completely agreed.  But, I have to call it as I see it at this point in time.<br /><br />As to Jarrett's let us call them vocalizations, if someone finds they detract significantly from the music then that is a reality for them, although not necessarily for others.  I have found them at worst a very minor irritant and in some cases I actually find them pleasing for adding a bit of additional character to the music. Besides, it is a bit relieving to know that even someone with such incredible artistic talent is not perfect.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I think the title says it all.. Why did God made the radio? - because of Brian! Guys, buy this album, this is music history! -<br />This album is one of those, wich you'll hear even in 50 years later!! It's a kind of a big selection of all Beach Boys-Songs ---> the only difference? -> these guys are 40 years older :)<br /><br />I now have two pieces of this album, because i ordered it here on Amazon, and as I walked to a shop near my Home in Austria, i saw this album AND I bought it too xD so let's make the Beach Boys #1 in the World again ;)

B007SGM084|5.0|Keeps your attention.  I love books that grab you (no pun in tended ) when you first start reading them.  This usually means you will not be able to put it down, which I did not.  Read all 3 books very quickly. Loved it!

B004SEUJNM|5.0|This is an American classic that deserved to be honored with a Digibook release. I loves this movie and it looks and sounds great. My only complaint is that the packaging on the disc itself sucks. It is just a sleave. I like the digibooks with the plastic case that snaps the dis into place and holds it better.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a really really fun and challenging game. l really enjoyed the darts game it wad the most fun game so far!
B007WFR1MQ|4.0|You can always count on fear factory in delivering on their patented sound. Sure all the songs sound the same (as my wife will say) but that's exactly what I love about it.  Start to finish Fear Factory is one of the few bands that I'll actually buy the whole album. I even ordered a cd from amazon! The only other cds I ordered in the last 5 years would have been the last Fear Factory, Metallica, and last Kreator (which new Kreator is out now as well!!!).  Still doesn't compare to Archetype which I think is their best work, but it still does not disappoint. Not as many hooks in the songs, but The Industrialist seems to flow where Mechanize left off.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is a couple reasons. 1st a gripe with amazon (or record company) that sends me an email to preorder which I do, but I get a regular version of the cd with 10 songs and not the limited which is the only one found now on amazon after a few days of release.<br /><br />Second. The bonus songs don't sound like I'm missing something, but there's hardly even 10 songs on the regular album. Track 9 is basically a short (<2min) ending of a song. Track 10 is a ridiculous 9+min of something that should be background noise in a line at Universal Studios. I like an album with an experience, but come on FF. It doesn't seem that there's all that much to a song, just fill the cd with the normal machine gun guitars and drums and I'll be happy.

Excellent book by an author that I admire.<br /><br />Also, I saw Chris speak last night on his book tour. I'd recommend attending the tour as well. It was cool to hear about how he did the research, more details about some of the entrepreneurs profiled in the book, and how Chris has created a loyal following. He's an inspiration. Great book!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow. I never really knew what to expect throughout all three books, but wow. I've never read anything like it. What's so great is the author touches on what people love most about great stories...once they are over, you always want to journey back to the beginning, where it all started. And she does just that at the end, but from the other character's perspective. Just perfect! I have read a lot of books, and never has one gone like that. A very satisfying love story...even better than The Notebook.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This game takes a lot of patience. Often, I have to reset the game because I've made a mistake or I get frustrated, but it feels nice when I finish a puzzle, like I've accomplished something that only smart people can accomplish... at least, that's what I tell myself.
030758836X|4.0|I thought this was an interesting read with well developed characters. And I must say (without divulging the plot) that I was surprised (in a good way) by some of the plot twists which definitely made for a non-predicatable storyline. I gave this only 4 stars however, because I was greatly disappointed in the ending. It just fizzled for me and I could not reconcile why the main character would choose to do what he did.

B007IE4DSG|5.0|George Harrison has always had a way of touching something deep inside of me and Early Takes Volume 1 does not fail in that regard either. Each song is intimate, simple and touching. The songs that George wrote and sang always make me think and reflect. I am so glad to hear these songs that are done in such a simple and intimate way and I know you will also if you are a George Harrison fan. I am so fortunate to have the songs of George Harrison in my life. My favorite song on this album is Run of the Mill which basically says that we have the choice of what to make of our lives, what attitude will we take? It is you and I that decide. How true. Thanks George, and thanks to those that sought to bring these great recordings to light. I cannot wait until Volume II comes out.
0345803485|4.0|I must say the book started a bit slow but by the end I was distraught that it ended the way it did. then I remember it was a trilogy! Yippee, off to the second book:-)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is good and its very basic to use when allow tu need is a percent key the multiply and divide signs and the #s of corse
0345803493|5.0|The first book started a bit slow but it was still great.  This book was funny and full of plot, also.  I am enjoying the trilogy- first books I have stayed up to read in years!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is as much \\"literature\\" as \\"The Anal Girls of Tobacco Road 2: Vagina Slimes\\" is a cinematic masterpiece. I did, however, give it two stars instead of one, merely because I liked the silver balls.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is pretty sweet.  It tells you the weather and it is as inaccurate as the weatherman.  Worth downloading
0345803507|5.0|This story comes to show you how people can really change...even tho he still protective and possessive its not out of harm and he's the way he is because he never had anyone that loved him and the tought of loosing that person terrified him. I have to say there was soo many sex parts which at times was boring!!!!!!! When there wasn't sex i was eager to learn more about Christian's character and I loved it when he told her about Elena... And even tho he didn't tell her everything entirely it was a progress in the book. I'm glad they're making movies because I sure will be watching them!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The first book is amazing. The second and third books are good but not as good as the first. The story also gets a bit long winded in places especially if you read them all together. I will however highly recommend the books as the story is really good and has some exciting twists and turns.
B00005NB8K|5.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"The Doors,\\" a film by Oliver Stone. If you enjoy rock 'n' roll and the life-style that seems to be associated with it, then you might enjoy this film. The Doors were a rock group whose leader, Jim Morrison, was a beach dude from Venice, California, and who's personal theme song was \\"The World Owes Me A Living.\\" Jim met up with another Venice beach person who liked his poetry and first thing you know a couple other guys joined and they put together a band which quickly became popular. It was on to Whiskey A Go-Go, a Los Angeles dive for up and coming bands, then on to San Francisco, a recording contract and off to New York City, all in a very short time span. Burning the candle at both ends became a way of life. The Doors fame quickly grew and their records hit big-time and the funding rolled in. Jim Morrison's ego quickly inflated to mega-proportions and he began to hold everyone in contempt, his venue owners, the police, his loyal girlfriend, his band-mates and, ultimately, even his fans, while he proclaimed that life wasn't worth living and that he wanted to die. His intake of intoxicants was prodigious and he favored hard booze, guzzled straight from the bottle. His shows gradually became intoxicated brawls until, finally, he died of heart problems at the old age of 29. Okay, I've glossed it over a bit but that's the general gist. It's an interesting story and the general outline fits more than one rock group.<br /><br />The movie was quite excellent, in my opinion. Well done! The acting was believable. You could actually feel as if you're a member of the entourage and are going through this ridiculous rise and fall right along with Morrison and his bandmates. Some died-in-the-wool Doors fans, of  which there are many, may find the Oliver Stone depiction to be harsh and unrealistic and I have no way of judging this matter. Most of the Doors extremely popular songs have faded with 60s' memories and styles. I haven't heard any of the songs on \\"Oldies but Goodies\\" stations for several decades. It's good hearing the Doors music again in the context of the times. Very enjoyable. The Doors have become one of the music critics legendary darlings, so a lot of interesting extra materials are included on a second disc. Be sure to view it. This is quite a worthwhile DVD packet, whether you liked the Doors or not.<br /><br />Gary Petersonf the songs on \\"Oldies but Goodies\\" stations for several decades.

0525423656|3.0|Maybe its just because i have read a lot of YA Dystopia lately, but i got tired of this storyline really fast. I feel like i've already read this in the Delirium series and the Divergent series and even the Hunger Games to a point. They all seem to have very similar setups: a girl, in a dystopian world, decides to go against whatever the oppressive forces (usually government) have planned for her, she is not particularly interesting as a character, she falls in love with a boy (or two simultaneously), later, maybe in the next book in the trilogy, it escalates to joining some sort of cause, rebellion, military action (etc) against the oppressive force.... Honestly, i felt Delirium and Pandemonium fill the same purpose as Matched and Crossed, and i liked them better, especially the characters. If you were dissatisfied with this book, maybe try out those instead. All in all, it wasn't horrible, but it felt repetitive to me. I give it a C+.
0307592731|4.0|The PCT has always fascinated me, and I enjoyed following along on Ms.Strayed's journey.  If you are really interested in the PCT though, go and grab a copy of Colin Fletcher's \\"Thousand Mile Summer\\", a lyrical as well as practical story of his trip.  It is a classic.
0385737955|4.0|The book was very hard to put down-- it keeps you waiting for answers and guessing, even though that gets frustrating at times. I was a little let down by the last book in the series, but i think this series is solid and worth a read. If youve read the Hunger Games and need more to satisy your hankering for future-set dystopian group of kids dying off, i found the Maze Runner series to be an entertaining and enjoyable choice. Not really your choice if youre looking for romance however.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|HOW IS THE KINDLE EDITION MORE THAN THE PAPERBACK???????? I THOUGHT THE POINT OF GETTING A KINDLE FOR 200 DOLLARS WAS TO CUT COSTS? COME ON AMAZON.
B0086700CM|5.0|its exactly like the ipad version and it is addicting. I really love it a lot. keep on buying.  tull love it.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|never have i seen a show with such great acting, action, story, and character depth. even after the tragedy of andy whitfields death the show has manage to stay strong with liam mcintyre, who i think is just as good as andy. the new arch-villains are not quite as good as batiatus and tullius from blood and sand and gods of the arena, respectively, but glaber and co are still fanstastic and the scheming among characters is as good as ever. still one of my favorite shows on tv. definitely a must-watch for any self-respecting tv fan.<br /><br />5 stars
006197806X|4.0|This is a decent dystopian series. I enjoyed this book. My only complaint is the back and forth from then and now style writing she uses in this book. Each chapter has you jumping back and forth. I understand it builds suspense and anticipation, but it was almost annoying to the point I was tempted just to start skiping chapters so I could read it in order. Other than that I liked this book
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was spellbinding! It was very difficult to put down. Book was finished in 1 1/2 weeks. Other books were purchased already.
B005USZML4|1.0|This book by John Grisham is like an Andy Hardy novel. Trivial and predictable. There's no sophisticated plot and seems it is written for 12  year olds. Where's the complexity of story and characters Grisham used to be able to write? The book starts off about one character who disappears and then we never hear about him again. The secondary character Theo, becomes the protagonist and his story is pretty boring.<br />Terribly disappointed with this read.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I have been looking for this movie in stores for 7 years and I finally decided to buy it off of amazon! I LOVE this movie and would definitely recommend this movie! It is kind of a dark movie so you kind of have to be into that kind of stuff to enjoy the movie.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I hope the person in charge of marketing this movie got fired!  It is a fun movie that deserved better than what it got.  I love sci fi and adventure...this has it all!  The sound track was great and the special effects are top notch.  Better then Prince of Persia and Conan the Barbarian!  Well worth watching again!  I so wish I had seen it in the theater!
0345803485|5.0|I can't believe this book got bad reviews. I am not the book ready kind of girl. I have 3 boys and am always busy between them, work, and normal housework activities. I usually don't have time for me let alone reading a book. In 3 days I finished this book. It was such an easy read. I couldn't put it down. I wanted more and more. It made me laugh and cry. I would definitely recommend this book to others. It made me feel like I was her. plus gave me some ideas for my bedroom :)
B007P4OTHO|5.0|We finally have a remaster that sounds better then the original.  The clarity of David Bowie's vocals, and Mick Ronson's electric grooves stand out immensely on this classic album, which clearly received the honor treatment. The talent that existed in the 1960's and 70's will never again be duplicated and these ELEVEN songs prove it. This album is celebrating it's 40th Anniversary and it still ROCKS!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is absolutely fun. If your a fan of apps that get you addicted and make you not want yo drop your device, this game is it. It feels like a constant Indiana Jones chase scene.
B000021YQV|5.0|If you're a metal fan, you'll most likely enjoy this album. I listen to thrash, groove, sludge/doom, death and some nu-metal along with classic rock.  Although elitists consider this nu-metal (no solos), its one heavy album and the lyrics make quite a bit of sense.  IMO, SOAD blow Slipknot away. This album and its predecessor are both heavy hitters.  Don't let people influence your musical tastes. This coming from a metalhead.
0765316994|1.0|This is an onanistic shallow and very disappointing book. Little or no character development. What should have been an interesting short story based on a somewhat interesting conceit has been puffed out to novel length and suffers hugely from the increased exposure. Don't waste your time or money. I have been a great fan of Mr. Scalzi's previous books and even suffered through some of the mostly silly \\"shorts\\" that have been selling as  $.99 ebooks. Self-consciously \\"clever\\" dialog is not a substitute for character or plotting. The only interesting element was the coda about writer's block which, I fear, seems to be very close to home for him as reflected in recent work.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I thought the whole premise of this book was totally demeaning and degrading to women and also not very well written as well. Just the idea that this innocent young girl would lower her standards and her self-respect for some man just because he was good looking and extremely wealthy made me ashamed and sick at the same time. She certainly got more than she bargained for in more ways than one. I would not have wasted my money if I had known about this book's content.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I admit when I got my Kindle 3 weeks ago, I went a little crazy and made a few mistakes. This was one of them. While I'm obviously late to the game here, no pun intended, I will ask for a refund. I admit I didn't bother to see the movie but I tried to finish the book and could not. I found myself nodding off a couple of time and asking, what is all the fuss about? I couldn't get past the boring plot, the predictability, and there was NO buildup at all. I simply gave up.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This product was quite helpful.  The information it contained was mostly in other areas of the Amazon site, but this put it together in one place and facilitated easy access via one's Kindle.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it is a cool combination of fighting and undead combat. it is a gr8 game and it's really fun. the end
0439023521|5.0|I read this book and thought \\"What is wrong with this author?  How could she write something so disturbing, so twisted, so sick?\\".  Then I thought \\"Why couldn't it have been me who wrote something this good\\".

B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is incredible! I had been waiting forever to get the app. it is probably the most addicting game I have ever played.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The story is, some pigs decided to steal some eggs from a group of birds which have special abilities to destroy things in their own special  way. Your eyes will be glued to the screen untill you are forced to remove them, and even then you won't  be able to wait untill you play it once again.<br />  the levels are very challenging and the noise that the birds use as a battle  cry is a little annoying, but you definitely won't  regret purchasing  this game!! :)
B00846REIS|5.0|I know there has been lots of comparisons of this book and 50 Shades of Grey. Yes, the story contains detailed sex scenes and a handsome, wealthy man with issues. But isn't that the storyline for thousands of romance novels? I mean 50 Shades is Twilight for adults but I digress. This book was wonderfully written about two adults - who speak and act like adults trying to form a relationship in spite of all their issues. What I found very refreshing is that the author does not try and make either character sound like the perfect person. I really enjoyed this especially when it came to the lead male - Gideon. I think too many of these types of books try to make these men sound like someone you'd be happy to see your daughter bring home ignoring the fact he's all kinds of messed up in the head.<br /><br />Another aspect of this book that was nice was the diversity. I like that the sideline character has a bit of a mysterious story himself and that it is developing with the main story without overshadowing - not an easy thing to do. I discovered this book and Shades at the same time, but elected to read Shades first because of all the hype. I'm glad I decided to go back and read this title as a last ditch effort before giving up on this genre. I'm excited for the next release.
B000Q7ZJ9Y|5.0|Almost as good as Justice live...almost. Product got here in a timely matter, considering where it was coming from in relation to where I live (Oregon).
B00899EOIS|5.0|The season 3 premiere was exactly what i expected for the new A!!!! I recommend watching it!!! Cant wait for episode two!!!!!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Love this album.  It is stuck in my head and hit deep in my heart.  This album is an emotional roller coaster.  Several of the songs have you looking back such as \\"This'll Be My Year\\", \\"Bruises\\" and \\"Feels Good At First\\" all reminding us of our past.  While other songs have you looking forward such as \\"Sing Together\\" and \\"When The Fog Rolls In\\".  Then there is the heart wrenching \\"You Can Finally Meet My Mom\\" that puts death in a positive light.  Of course there is the upbeat \\"Drive By\\" and \\"California 37\\" that completes this well rounded album.  Looking forward to more music from Train in the future.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is awesome!!!it came to kindle!!!!! now I can blame you imangi for not letting me go to sleep because I cant stop playing the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :) :) :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun! Fun! Fun!  Try it ... you'll like it!  Fast paced - challenging - creative! Good for younger and older players.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game was free when I got it but knowing how fun it is, I would pay for it for sure.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its fun and addicting and a really good time passer... also really great for keeping the little ones occupied..... don't know what else to say
0345803485|2.0|I still don't understand why this is getting such rave reviews. The writing is so poor. Why didn't her editor gently send it back and say \\"you've got the beginnings, now just smooth it out here and here and take out the twelve thousand times Ana chews her lips and all the times that Christian presses his lips in a hard line, think about the words you are using\\" etc...The writing totally got in the way for me.<br /><br />I have greatly enjoyed the works of Alison Tyler - [[ASIN:B006YAC40O Cuffing Kate]], [[ASIN:0352341661 Melt With You (Cheek)]], [[ASIN:0352340398 Tiffany Twisted (Cheek)]] to name but a few. She writes very hot smut and it is also well written. It really does make a difference.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I thought this film would be awful, but was suprised how good it was. like a back to the future but with a star gate flare.
B007N85ZXY|2.0|Neil gave up a tour with the Buffalo Springfield so he could release a cd filled with uninspired covers of old folk tunes? If you join back up with Crazy Horse, you should at least have new material. This will get played about as often as \\"Fork in the Road\\" - one listen and then back on the shelf.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|kids loved playing it me as well and I'm 35 thanks hope you do more updates for this game. thanks

Having learned the language of flowers from the only woman who was interested in adopting her, she takes a job in a floral shop.  Her journey to wholeness is insightful and fascinating.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very exciting addictive and playful. it gets your adrenalin pumping. I LOVE IT. it is worth your while to play. you will fall in love
B005URRCUY|5.0|Words cannot express how much I ADORE this album. Did Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney take a time machine from the 60s or 70s? Because they are as amazing as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zepplin, T Rex, AC/DC, Donovan, you name it...rolled into one. Somehow they manage to capsulize the ideal sound...must be something in the water in Akron, because they are most definitely right up there with Chrissie Hynde in my book.  Rock on and enjoy!!!!
B006WAIV6M|4.0|Quite an interesting book on why habits exist and how it can be changed. The key to exercising regularly  and achieving success is understanding how habits work.<br />Hopefully this will help me change of my life time habits like procrastination and being indecisive
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great fun to play with the whole family. My 3 yr old plays it and she even loves it and it's easy.
B0086700CM|5.0|ok so I got this app. my friends kept talking about so I said what a heck and got and I love it!! I told my friends and they said&quot;told u so&quot;
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a good game but it sucks that you cant get the mighty eagle. They just came out with surf and turf a few monthes ago
B005LAIGNC|1.0|I have to say I have not viewed Red Tails yet.  I have been looking forward for it to come out on Blu-ray since I honestly cannot stay awake in the movies anymore for any movie.  One thing I would like to know is why in the world do I have to buy a Blu-ray, DVD and sometimes a Digital Disk, when all I want is the Blu-ray.  I've noticed that on almost every new release, you have to buy the pricey 2 or 3 digit version.  I now buy very few Blu-rays and when the movie isn't an action or big CG movie, I'll drop down and buy it on DVD or wait it out to buy the Blu-rays when they pop the price down to 9.99 because nobody wants to pay 25 - 30 dollars for the movie.  So whenever I see a movie that I cannot buy as a single Blu-ray, it will get 1 star from me for that alone.  Now about the movie again, as some of you mentioned, the movie in 1995 \\"The Tuskegee Airmen\\" is well worth the watch.  If you haven't seen that movie yet, catch it before you view this one.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this game because its one of the longest and one of the most fun angry birds games iv played.angry birds seasons year of the dragon is awesome because i can use mighty dragon. Althogh it kinda sucks that you cant get mighty eagle.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book. Lots of action and excitement.<br /><br />I don't understand why this book is so popular with teenage girls. I have read Twilight, which is clearly written for teenage girls, but Hunger Games is nothing like Twilight. Hunger Games should appeal to people of all ages in my opinion.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is beastly beastly beastly beastly beast amazingly awesome and you need to get this app because it is amazingly awsome
B005SN4ZBE|5.0|I loved this book. It changed how I view money and people.<br /><br />Some of the keys points:<br /><br />1. Most millionaires live modest lives and spend significantly less than they make.<br />2. Plenty of non-millionaires drive BMW's and live in huge houses. However, these people have little money in the bank.<br />3. If you support your adult children financially, they will always be dependent on you. It is better to make they support themselves.
B0086700CM|5.0|so fun and addicting<br />I love it<br />all my friends have it<br />so I do now<br />thc for the game<br />love it
B0086700CM|5.0|I have played temple run before on a friends ipod and loved it and got addicted to it within an hour. So when I bought my kindle this was the first game I downloaded and play it for at least 2 hours a day.
B00024I2Z4|1.0|This movie had several freeze spots that skipped right over long moments of the movie. I am now gonna have to repurchase it elsewhere.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game since i got my kindle fire. people say it lags and has glitches but on my kindle i havent had any problems. it is just a fun and addictive game. DOWNLOAD IT NOWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|I had temple run on my ipod and was dying to get it on my kindle fire, so when it came, I was ecstatic!! I got it and still play it a lot, BUT.....there are some downs to this app:<br />1) The graphics aren't that good<br />2) The game lags sometimes<br />3) It's a lot harder to play on a bigger device and a bigger screen<br /><br />But nonetheless, Temple Run is a must-have, weather that be on your phone, ipod, ipad or kindle. But if you can get it or have it for free on a smaller device, I strongly recommend you don't get it on the kindle, nook, or ipad.
B0086700CM|3.0|The game is great but, it needs more to it.  Its a little boring to do the same thing over and over again.  JUST ADD MORE TO IT.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is way more fun than it should be. Seems so simple... There are only four possible moves, swiping in each direction, but it's really challenging. The goals are a nice touch, so you're not just mindlessly running.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love every bit of this game. It plays really well on the kindle fire. Very little updates and easy to earn money with an option to by it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|watch out.  it's addictive.  such an improvement on the original version from my childhood.<br />I ran out of energy quickly but it automatically replenishes if you wait.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|It took awhile for the action to pick up, but when it<br />did, WOW!  Amazing.  Better than Star Wars, equal to<br />Avatar and good animation.  Well worth the money.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|After being chased in a rotating maze by armed blob creatures, finally escaping only to arrive in another science experiment, I expected a little better of a finish! Life in the \\"real world\\" was kind of like every other disease-ridden dystopian future. What made me angry was the feeling I had at the end - I read all three books, and THIS is the ending? Seriously? This? I really hate it when the ending is basically one rendered improbable (at best) by the \\"rules\\" of the virus itself - and they supposedly had infected people with them. Can you say, \\"Writer on deadline?\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! I'm hooked on it. I like how you can earn points to unlock levels and not have to pay for it
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I try out alot of the free games on my Kindle Fire. This is one of my favorites that I have not uninstalled. It's very cute and fun to play and you don't have a spend a lot of your own cash to advance further into the game. The graphics are cute too! Fun Fun!
B0018QQQK8|2.0|book is ok but missing some pages in the upload..do not want it re loaded though..It is not a book that captures your attention very quickly,
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really liked this game at first and then there was a weird glitch in it and it would not let me click on anything or advance further so I stopped for a while until I got an App update notice. After I updated it, it was working again so I started playing with it again. The graphics are good and the game is pretty fun. I'm getting a little bored with it though so I'm starting to slow down on playing it. Don't want to spend my own cash on this game to advance.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app rocks I cant stop playing it it is super fun get this app now!This app is really super awesome and cool.

I had been waiting to purchase this for a couple of months and being able to purchase it on May the 4th was just the icing on the cake.  Delivery was speedy and the product is just the best.  My wife loves the book like look and feel of the case.
B007VGXS8M|1.0|this game won't even download! keep getting there was an error please try again. then download failed. and now that I have read the reviews I am glad. but I need to check if I was charged for it!
B0086700CM|5.0|first time i played this game was in my friend's ipad. it's great. i got this game in my kindle fire, and i love it. it's good to kill time.<br />'
0670023329|5.0|This is an absolutely riveting story about the Shin Dong-hyuk's harrowing escape from a North Korean work camp.  Shin was born in one of North Korea's \\"no-exit\\" camps, i.e. camps where there is no chance at rehabilitation or at eventually being released. Born of a mother who was given to another prisoner as a reward for good work, he never knew any other life than loveless grueling days in which his only concept of human existence was the constant search for enough food. Harden has a great sense of narrative and juxtaposes Shin's experience growing up in the camps with that of Kim Jong II's privileged son of the same age as a way to highlight life in North Korea. It's a slim memoir and in many ways the brevity makes it more visceral and immediate. It reminded me of Ishmael Beah's A Long Way Gone.
B004GYY714|5.0|There are thausand of program in the radio app. I use it at my daily life. that's great! i love it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Book two may get a little slow, but the rest of the books are outstanding.  I can't wait for sequels (or prequels).
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I know it's probably a crime punishable by the RIAA, but this album is so very and totally over-rated. Musically, not that interesting or stimulating. Somebody got paid off big time to promote this music.  I miss the days of locally owned radio stations that could play what they wanted.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|A very good read and I found it difficult to put the book down. The theme of a young boy abandoned to a martial school, survival, growth into manhood, and gradual discovery of his special gift is not a particularly original theme, but is extremely well done. It is in a style reminiscent of Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicles. I quickly identified with the protagonist, Vaelin, who is strongly characterized, and I thoroughly enjoyed his friends and companions. His antagonists were also well defined and consistent. There is much nonstop completely believable fighting action, religious dissension, betrayal, disillusionment, a mysterious 'He who waits\\", and background love that all admirably add texture the story.<br />I look forward to reading the sequel.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is very. very. very.  very fun to play!!! addicting.... very very addicting! lol its very fun and you keep wanting to play all the time!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I love Star Wars and I am not bothered by the fact that certain parts of each movie were digitally remastered.  The films on Blu-ray look and sound great, plus you cannot beat having them all in one compact box set.  The price isn't terrible for what you are getting either.  I'm extremely glad I bought this!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Received as a gift from our daughter since she enjoyed series so much.  We started laughing from the beginning and enjoyed every episode.  A great escape to family entertainment.  Touches on all parts of family life in a light-hearted manner.  Treats todays \\"sensitive\\" issues more realistically than most of us are willing to admit.  Thank you daughter.  Will be purchasing the next season today.
014241543X|4.0|Book was in good condition. There was a little wear but nothing bad. Binding was good and not to much shelf wear.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have a Fire and had no problem with downloading or managing the puzzle pieces. It is fun to have as alternative to other games and free to boot.
B0086700CM|4.0|this app is awesome but it can be slow sometimes.  yeah!  you will love it!  but some of the objectives are like imposibal like &quot;MUST COLLECT 750 COINS IN ONE RUN&quot;  well....I cant do it can you.....
0345803493|5.0|This book is just as good as the first one  !!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am now on to the third book and what i have read so far is super.
B0086700CM|4.0|its a real good game you need the right timing and speed to play also extremely addicting to a degree though sometimes it may freeze on me its still a good game.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think that Angy birds is a great game. And now, its free on amazon. Whether its launching the birds or destroying the pigs I love it
B000A88EVE|5.0|This is one of my all time favourite films. I love movies that make me think, contimplate all of existence. To experience what the characters experience. To remember why it is we are alive.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|Overall not a bad play experience. Not an overly common puzzle. Not very good on a small screen. Marks are hard to place, touch the boxes to fill or mark them and strike incorrectly gets bothersome. Not recommended for the thick finger crowd hehe.
B00280LYIC|5.0|What a good story. It pulled me in and kept me turning the pages. So, I'm already on to the next book.
0517255464|5.0|This is a great visual for anyone who needs a book they can lean on for anatomy! I recommend it as a great visual for 3D Modelers and Artist alike. It has a lot of different positions as well as great breakdowns of the muscles being used. It has that classic art style that reminds you of Da Vinci and some really great tidbits. Amazing to think this was written ages ago and is still one of the best anatomy art guides still out there!
1594745692|5.0|I recieved my Zombie Tarot deck today and just had to write to tell you how great it is. I haven't stopped laughing. This deck is very easy to read with and the pictures on the cards are outstanding. What a fun deck. Thank you so much for creating this impressive Tarot ! Trudy S.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|I admit I only watched this movie cuz Emma Watson was in it....she's just too lovely to pass up a movie on. I'm a guy what can I say. She's breathtaking. It was nice seeing her in a movie outside Harry Potter.  She proved that she can act.  Brains and beauty.  Her character goes through the movie to be onstage and acting. When she becomes real famous she turns a bit into a brat and selfish. She pushes Petrova in acting just to help her own place in theater. Once the lead female role in Alice in wonderland is given to her understudy she realizes her bratty ways and selfishness has gone too far and makes her readjust herself to be more humble and giving.<br /><br />The cast was pretty good and I liked the ensemble for the most part.  It has a decent ending I guess with an overall lesson I guess which is Dreams Do Come True.<br /><br />The DVD includes deleted scenes and about a 20-25 minute interview with Emma Watson about the movie which I enjoyed very much.<br /><br />Definitely worth picking up if you are fan of the book(which I never read) or like Emma Watson like me. LOL
B00846F1YW|5.0|I had a lot fun with my first hidden object game and enyoed the story along with it.  I bought the first Mysteryville to see if the stories were tied together.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game gets really addicting, overall its a good game to pass some time with, although it lags a bit sometimes
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This was actually long overdue. The entire technical process is explained in this book, along with how to use some of the tools that make proofing the final product much easier. Best of all, it was free! If you're interest in publishing your books on the Kindle platform, you need to have this title close at hand.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for some time now for this to come out and it finaly did I'm happy... took them long enough though
0425152251|5.0|I believe that everyone should read this book. It makes you think about the whole world in different ways, providing a basic history of philosophy very accessibly. Truly mind-blowing!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good game for a long car trip or it you take a train to work. watch the short. it was funny as always.<br />wife and kids both played and liked this game.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you read the first two books, then the third is a must read. I fell in LOVE with Christian Grey in book one and I was sad that it was only 3 books. It left me wanting more & more. The story is a little repetitive but it was a great story.
0307455874|1.0|I will admit that I have not read on word from this book. Today, I am taking a play from the liberal playbook and giving a one star review to a book that I know nothing about because I despise the person that authored the book. It was written by a man who is destroying our great country with his agenda. He will exploit anything or anyone for his own personal political gain. He is NOT A CHRISTIAN! OR AN A M E R I C A N! WAKE UP AMERICA!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Absolutely love this app on the kindle fire! I have had no problems with it!<br />the only thing that could make it better is if you had more than 2 themes to choose from. but I'm not picky.<br />anyway- great app! love it!! :)
B000PMLFRA|1.0|The transfer is clearly excellent, but I still refuse to pay for an inferior edit of the trilogy. It's obvious Lucas knows the theatrical versions are in high demand. I don't have a problem with this being released, but it should be available alongside the original edits of the films. It's not even about which versions are better: it's about being given the choice to see whichever version you prefer. If Ridley Scott can provide five versions of one film in a single box set (Blade Runner) and countless other films get two releases (theatrical and director's cut) in one box, then I'm quite sure LucasFilm could and should have provided both versions of the trilogy here.<br /><br />I'm not sure what good it'll do at this point, but there's still a petition over at originaltrilogy.com that might be worth signing if you care about this.
B000002WPH|5.0|Does this album even need a review?  36 Chambers is probably the most consistently solid Wu-Tang release there is, and there's quite a few.  Everyone has their favorite track, but even your least favorite still has ridiculous flow, and exceptional RZA production.  This is, in my opinion, one of the pinnacles of 90s rap, and has not at all deprecated.  If you're considering getting into the hip hop/rap genre, but think that pop-rap is too marginalizing/bad, this should be your entry point.  There are rhymes that make you think, hooks that you can't help but join in with, and beats that will make you tap your foot and bob your head.  If nothing else, this record is a piece of hip hop history; hearing all of the members of the Clan interact on the recording is awesome, and knowing that the camaraderie between all these people that eventually went on to do their own thing was legit is pretty awesome.  Do yourself a favor, pick this up, and then listen to it real hard.  It's like going in a hip hop time machine.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|My kids really enjoy this game. It is easy to play and holds their interest. Would just suggest that not every task require an energy, seems to run out fast.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Thought it would be boring, however a nice twist from a childs perspective, A friend highly recommended, so based on her opionion I decided to try and I definetly would tell a friend to read this book. Pleasantly surprised.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|The marketing is what bombed this movie. No one should pass this movie by. It contains incredible 3d effects, impressive visuals, and a great story by the same author as Tarzan!
0811876373|5.0|I finally got a copy of this as a birthday gift and LOVE, LOEV, LOVe it. Am obsessed with trying out each design, can't wait to see how each one turns out !
B004GYNPL2|4.0|It does a great job. I really like the ability to use dropbox to sync. They just need to create a dedicated tablet version.
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|Despite the fact that it's a free app, gReader is the best google reader app on the market. Nice work developers.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is very fun I love it it makes you want to play it over and over again you haft to get this app.
159413586X|5.0|I ordered the paperback and didn't pay close attention and I accidentally ordered the LARGE PRINT. Ugh. It's my own fault, but I'm still a little ticked at myself I guess. The words are monstrously huge. I'm going to read it and hopefully it won't give me a headache. Either that or I'll have to hold it a complete arms distance away from me. Oh well. So for those of you ordering paperback...be warned. Don't get the large print unless you're practically blind.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|I always wanted this CD! and I know the music and lyrics bij hard. And now I own it and its great!!! It sounds well know but still new and thats's because the music is from all times. The quality is great, because remastered.
1577314808|5.0|This book changed my life in a good way and I know that I will be putting the words into practice daily. It's definetely a book you'll want to have with you even after you read it to go back to it and review it to keep putting it into practice. I feel so much better now after reading this book. It has opened my eyes to lots things.
B007N85ZXY|1.0|For years I bought every album Neil released. I consider him one of the most influential artists in rock history. He has released some great albums and some where his experiments didn't work as well. But I have always been interested in listening...until now. This album is just awful. It makes you wonder if he is laughing at us for buying this. The song selection is nonsensical and Crazy Horse is embarrassingly amateurish. I sincerely hope Neil has great music left in him, but this isn't it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Profoundly tragic story of a child abandoned by her birth mother & the entire foster system. Her first encounter with unconditional love confuses her and damns her to a legacy of pain & peril. Throughout I found myself remaing hopeful that she will finally accept the true love meant to be hers. I believe you will be glad you read this one & feel her pain and her fleeting moments of joy as if they are your own.
B007JUWM64|1.0|I've been waiting for a new version of the Three Musketeers for years. What a disappointment. Being a huge fan of the Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, and Michael York version, the new casting looked great. Matthew Macfayden is wonderful and he was terrific in the new version of Pride and Prejudice so he's not the issue, nor is the rest of the new cast. How could it all go so terribly wrong? The new script was ridiculous. It bears little resemblance to Alexandre Dumas' story. Perhaps it should have been positioned as a parody or fantasy version like Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Slayer. Then people who are fans of the original version of the Musketeers series would not be so puzzled by this version. This new version is a prime example of how dangerous special effects can be in the wrong hands. A total waste of a great cast, a classic story, and a huge budget. The end of the movie sets the story up for a sequel. If indeed that is the case, I hope there is an intervention before this tragic cinematic release is continued. There is always hope for a better script and less CGI. Remember Star Trek: The Motion Picture (terrible) vs. Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (terrific)? It is possible.
0345529057|5.0|When I saw the price of this collection, I knew I had to have it.  I'm almost done with Clash of Kings and I'm excited to continue the series with Storm of Swords.  George R.R. Martin really knows how to engage his readers and spin a tale of fantasy that leaves us wanting more.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|I cant rate this book high enough I usually only read thrillers  I found the families were all believable and the historical setting perfect could not put this down I cant wait for the next book of this trilogy
B0086700CM|5.0|this such an awesome app.  its so much fun.  its cool how when you die it shows you a picture that shows you how you died.  its like one of the games that will entertain you when your bored.
B0086700CM|5.0|Most AWESOME game ever. So AWESOMELY cool. Everyone who is AWESOME should get this game. If you do not get this game you are totally not AWESOME.
0761158820|5.0|I bought several of these books for my \\"cedar chest\\" of things I get into when the grandchildren are with me.  These paper monsters have been a hit with every age and gender I have introduced them to - from 5 to myself (65).  They are comical monsters, beautifully drawn.  Each monster comes with a story of their origin that are hillarious; imaginations run wild!  The pieces are printed on cardstock; are well perforated so they punch out very easily and cleanly; they glue or tape together easily - depending on how much time you want to spend.  I tend to glue them carefully like I was making a model car, my  6 year old granddaughter tapes them quickly because she can't wait to see the character come alive. Either way they are wayy cool.  There are three levels of difficulty: easy, medium and difficult.  If you put them together with plastic tape rather than glue as the book suggests, all the characters can be easy to make.  Each character takes less than 30 minutes to glue together; much faster if you use tape.  Since there are 50 monsters in the book it takes several sessions to get them all done.  They are pretty resiliant so the kids (or adults) can play with them without worry about breakage.  This is my go-to gift for just about everyone, including adults (adults like to play too if they get a chance).  I am looking forward for Castleforte to put together more books like this.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best game in history! !! you need to get this game once you start you don't ever want to stop just like reading the hunger games:)
B007MJSQSK|4.0|I watched it with my husband and he loved it, I also liked it but probably I had higher expectations<br />Overall good
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great game! I am so addicted to this game I really love it. I just can not get enough of it
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Still working on getting some word docs to open correctly but all in all a great app docs are easy to find.
0307716546|2.0|This could have been a great story; it had a great structure. I got so tired of reading about Gracie's emotions and pontifications about motherhood and her connection to her two children.  I couldn't finish this story because I got tired of slogging through inner dialogue and wanted to know--who set that fire!?  If someone wants to message me and let me know, great. Because I have no intention of finishing this book.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|When I read the free, promotional first four chapter teaser that's been out for six weeks, I suspected Scalzi was up to something and I was right!  Bought the book, started on Chapter 5 and prepared for the slick, unexpected and hysterical Scalzi plot twist that he's become famous for.  I won't spoil it for you -- just be ready.<br /><br />This is a fast moving, funny, satiricle and highly enjoyable romp.  It's a tribute to the golden age of \\"SyFy\\" on television, especially Star Trek, The Original Series.  And, personally, I LOVED the Codas, especially the third one.<br /><br />Scalzi purposely throws increasingly preposterous flying snowmen to see how much we can can take but gets away with it with some fancy footwork.  He now holds the record for deliberate reader dopeslapping and recovery, much like the first chapter of Android's Dream, which I am still laughing at.  While not great literature, Redshirts is great fun and I highly recommend it.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This review isnt about the prduct, its about the movie. Im 10 and saw it in the theatere, before reading the book,I actually got the point, im actally pretty good at that. But i have a friend (who is obssesed with the hunger games) who gave me some gave me some backround info.<br /><br />Good things: Overall, the movie was great. It is different then the books in quite a few ways. And its a PG13 movie, but its not as bloody as people say it is. Its more controlled, instead of all the kids just murdering each other like crazy. The whole plot and everything is good too, for the book and the movie. Its interesting and has some good parts. Its awesome with the bow and arrows and Katniss sleeping in the trees and stuff.<br /><br />Bad things: There were defenently some bad things about this movie, but i liked it so much i had to give it 5 stars. First of all, the characters are pretty boring. Like Katniss is just...Katniss, she is too quiet and there arent any \\"funny\\" characters in the movie. The second thing is that i didnt love the filming. Ok, i get that they are running in the forest, but no need to shake the camra up and down so much you cant see anything...its very annoying because the camra shakes so much durring the fighting parts, you cant see anything, it does kinda keep the violence at a minimum, so you dont cetch every time they stab each other. But i feel that you dont get enough of the action.<br /><br />I liked the movie enough to read the book, mostly because the main problem in the movie is the camra, and in the book the camra isnt shaking around like crazy.
0761169253|5.0|Love the graphics and layout. Great little book to read.  I am not sure if the title truly reflects what the book is.  It's a book full of good advice/proverb.  Take an hour or so to read.  Read it at the bookstore or whatever, you won't regret it.  Definitely would recommend this to a friend ...
B0083GCK5G|5.0|I didn't have any idea this was coming so it's a wonderful surprise. I'm on my second listen and I'm smiling with goosebumps. This seems a bit more mature and complex than their early work but it's for sure the Beach Boys and I'm loving it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I can play all day, on my breaks at work, when I am waiting around. Very much additive and an easy tome passer
B007SGM084|1.0|Did I just seriously waste my time reading this series? It started off promising but by the third book I found it a massive struggle to finish. Repetitive and boring. How can such a weak character have such influence over this hot rich supposedly strong man? Anytime I thought something good was going to happen it fizzled out. Of course everything turns out fine in the end even though the relationship is major messed up. This book is for sure soft porn and is annoying because it tries to masquerade as hard bdsm. I just wanted to see what these books were about and now I can say I sincerely regret it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|THIS GAME IS VERY FUN! I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME. I GIVE OREGON TRAIL MORE THAN FIVE STARS IF I COULD
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I am not sure if I should say but I really liked ALL of the songs.  This music is very nicely put together-the singing by all of the actors is great, the guitar playing is great, drums are wonderful, keyboards, base and the mix is prefect.  All it really comes together well is really tops!  It is fun music like a good musical should be and it really uplifting.  All the actors do an awesome job of signing, like really good.  Tom Cruise does totally awesome, Diego Boneta, Julianne Hough and even Alec Blaldwin--super performances.  I saw Rock of Ages on stage in Los Angeles and loved it, but this music tops it.  And like I said I really liked all of the music but just to see if I can narrow it to my favorite songs are Every Rose Has Its Thorn, Wanted Dead or Alive, Paradise City, Here I Go Again, Sister Christian/Just Like Paradise/Nothing But A Good Time and the really very cool finish of Don't Stop Believin.  Per an interview I saw with Adam Anders, the Executive Music Producer for the movie, he said that Def Leppard who did the original Pour Some Sugar on Me was on the set when Tom Cruise was performing this song and they were blown away by the performance.  I cannot wait to see the movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|wow I mean wowsers! this is an unthinkable game an amazing anddd' it's just I love it...... TEMPLE RUN :-)
0439023491|5.0|Awsome book it really capture your imaginations, and also help me with my paragraph comprehension for the asvab because it include words they used for that exam. Really recommended you will love the drama and the game.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is the best game ever !! I really like playing this game. Awesome stuff! I just want to keep playing this game over and over again. This is so addictive.  [...]
B001LM1456|4.0|Several attempts have been made to portray the Hulk in the movies.<br />This latest is a good effort with a decent story and characters you can root for if not identify with.<br />However, If you are looking for Shakespeare, or a great cinematic event you will be disappointed.<br />After all, this is a story based on a comic book reflecting the inner rage of the teen years.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|Ok so in a nut shell listening to the snipits did not do thge album justice until I recieved it a couple of days sort of got an advanced copy before it came out on the 5th of June. Now right away my first impression was it felt more like a Brian Wilson new solo album with guest spots by the Beach Boys, which gotta love another Brian Album. Then right away the album single and Title Track \\"That's Why god made the radio\\" was very good. it was catchy and all in all was a great song, getting on to my fav of the album was The Private life of Bill and Sue which as a brian fan sounded like the song South American from his Imagination album just had that whimsicle feel to it. Beaches had that late 60's groovey touch and Day Break over the ocean a great slow dancer on the beach over the moolight song. All it all 8 out of 10 in my personal opinion. For this album truly signifies that is why god made the beach boys for making That's Why God Made The Radio the album enjoy and have fun, fun, fun...
B0086700CM|2.0|I thought it was really boring, and a waste of time.  as soon as I started, I wished that I didn't get it.  I don't recommend it.
B000TNF7OC|5.0|a must for every one!<br />after you here master guitar player michael schenker do his job,you will end<br />up buying more of them
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|best app ever.  sometimes there are fun apps that don't last very long, but this app will last forever.  I totally recommend it.
B000SEIK2S|3.0|Decent Story, I can only understand 5 star reviews from that standpoint. Otherwise those people must not read much science fiction or like this light fast food time science fiction. Battles were fast and very undesrciptive. One of the aliens races I had no idea what it looked like and descriptions barely helped. The main character is basically god and cant barely do wrong and never has a bad idea. No great excitement but the story is decent enough that you will want to read it to finish. Not a bad idea for a universe just compared to alot of other books I read I felt like I was missing to much. If the author put a little more emphasis of fleshing out the action more instead of finishing up a huge battle in a page. I will read the sequels but I wont be buying it the same day like I do most stories I like.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I had only three expansions left and lots of completed families and decorations when the game froze.  I finally had to reinstall the game but of course I would have to start over.  No bueno.
0307887960|1.0|If you want to lose weight by being constipated, lethargic and in a bad mood, this is the diet for you.  I was on it for 7 days, 3 days on the attack phase and 4 days on the second phase.  I've never felt so bad in my life...I was miserable, and was never satisfied...always wanted to eat, even after downing 1/2 pound of meat, I still didn't feel satiated.  I should have known better than to start this diet.  When reading the book there were so many things that didn't make sense (weighing yourself multiple times a day, artificial sweeteners recommended, days of protein only with no vegetables, no fruit, no strenuous exercise!).  This is not a healthy way to lose weight.  Losing weight isn't rocket science, and we all know what we need to do: eat less, exercise more.  Do yourself a favor and join weight watchers (and a gym), and skip the crazy fad diets like this one.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Great for things like shopping lists.  Make sure to save the list so the list does not sync backwards.  Nothing worse then being at the store and your list disappears and an old one appears.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|angry birds space comments. I think it is great the only problem is I cannot get danger zone or the latest updates<br />_ for the game.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is an excellent adventure film. Interesting story and beautiful to watch. John Carter is an unusual character, sort of a haunted western film hero.<br />The script is often clumsy and the film staggers around before it gets the story started. If they'd cut the first scene with the Mars opening and start in Victorian times, trimmed the John Carter cavalry scenes and cut Deja's first scene with the 9th ray, the story would move better, unfold with more suspense. It's confusing, the way the film tries to start three times. I think that stagger-start threw a lot of audiences.<br />Even with the editing problems there are great alien characters, especially the pseudo-dog. Costumes, hair and makeup are beautiful, props and sets are fantastic. Nice twist at the end. I read all of ERB's John Carter books as a youngster so I was thrilled when the movie came out.<br />What Disney did or didn't do for marketing is a mystery to me. They should have called it \\"A Princess of Mars.\\" I know they bailed on this film too soon. Even with its flaws, you will enjoy this film.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I had this on my iphone.  I enjoyed it.  I now have it on my fire.  When I start playingi have to make myself quit.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game. always fun. card backs are really beautiful.  never a boring game. so much fun. a must have game!!!!
B004SRWW0C|5.0|Bought it on a good discount, had used it previously From a friend and it does all I could possibly need it to and more...I'm sure one of these days there'll be a free. Replace? Emt or a cheaper,  better alternative,  but for as long as I've been on Android this is,  was,  and has been unbelievably useful and a great value for what it does, should you need to be in there.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I had the afternoon off work and John Carter was the only thing on. Based on the marketing, I thought it was going to be horrible. So my expectations were pretty low. At any rate, I laughed and laughed and laughed at the intended humor in the film.  I absolutely love this film and when I heard later about the conspiracy to make this an unsuccessful film, ran as fast as I could to Amazon to get a copy on BluRay.  Relating films to video games, Nolan Bushnell's (Atari founder) main care was playability.  Doesn't matter how good a game looks; if the game play sucks, it's a bad game.  John Carter's CGI may not be polished, and suspending disbelief is necessary but was so much fun to watch, I just want to watch it again & again.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!

B0002VFXFE|5.0|Easy to work with. I have noticed a 5 degree C drop in CPU temps so far, after 5 days.<br />Tint first, wipe clean, and only a normal pea sized application. Go to the Arctic Silver web site for detailed instructions.<br />I would like to try some of the newer thermal compounds they offer, but I don't see how it could get any better.<br />Highly, Highly recommended. Don't use junk. Use Arctic Silver.
B00004TWZF|3.0|A controversial movie about two great champions of free-diving, their relationship with one another and that which bound both of them to the sea. The movie does not (and does not purport to) reflect the reality of these relationships however, it is only a fictional rendering of what the two men did and were. I found this disappointing, I would have preferred a real account of their real lives.<br /><br />Apparently Besson had tried to involve the two protagonists in the making of the film but for various reasons was only partially successful with Jacques Mayol and Enzo Maiorca refused all cooperation, which is why the movie protagonist is called Enzo Molinari. In a tragic ending that reminds one of the film's ending, Mayol committed suicide in 2001.<br /><br />Nonetheless, an interesting introspection into the personalities of the two characters. The film shows how an inner passion can motivate a person to do incredible feats and perform immense sacrifices, as well as to take extreme risks. All for no real, or at least no rational, reason.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Very nice motherboard. Supports AMD FX 8150 out of the box. Great utilities from Gigabyte.<br />I am happy they switched colors, this board is beautiful in black and gray. And a Dual BIOS!!<br />I received a version 1.1 and it booted to my AMD FX 8150 no problem. Bios was an F3 which is the minimum for FX support. I updated to F7 with the provided Gigabyte Utilities. Very easy and from within Windows. It also has an auto update feature so it will check for updates when ever you want and load it's self also in windows.. Or download the update to a thumb drive and plug in at boot, use Q-Flash on the Gigabyte Splash screen to find the update on the thumb drive then load.<br />Very nice board. 2 Thumbs UP to Gigabyte.<br /><br />Update: Dec 2012: No problems at all.<br />Dual BIOS saved me once. :)<br />Now using two XFX-R7770 DD video cards in CrossFire X. No issues with it either and it doubled frame rates. No micro-stutter.<br />See product photos for board temps from Open Hardware monitor.<br />I am using F9 Bios. (Dec 2012)<br />I would buy this board again, no reservations.<br />I have overclocked to 4.3ghz on the FX-8150, max temp 44.8C on stress test with a Corsair A-70 Cpu Air cooler (Tower cooler).<br />Only con: In Windows 8 Pro, This BIOS is not suppored by \\"secure Boot\\"<br /><br /> Update: May 22, 2014, Board still working great.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I am really enjoying this book!  It's almost as good as In The Name of the Wind.  Heck, it might turn out to be even better.  I'm about 80% finished it, and as soon as I'm done writing this, I'm going to finish reading it tonight.  Now where's Book 2?  Going to go search and hope it's out already!<br />I can see this book crossing genres also.  It's probably pegged as fantasy, but I can honestly see it appealing to anyone that likes good fiction.  Highly recommend, especially for the awesome price!  Very surprised it's selling for so little right now ($1.50 for kindle version).

B004H7QICG|4.0|This was my very first time building a computer and I decided to build a hack.  With suggestions from several sites, I decided to go with this case because of all the mac-specific hardware I needed to get.  Everything was a lot easier than I thought it would be.  Installation was practically self-explanatory and I was happy with the end result.  Having said that, I don't know if I'm the best reviewer for this since this is my first home built computer and I have nothing to compare it to.<br /><br />Here's what I liked: It's extremely quiet.  Even with the sides off of the case, I barely hear any of the fans.  It is very large and spacious.  I love that the hard drive cases slide out for convenience.  There's several spots for hard drives and disc players.  In fact, after installing a blu-ray burner and dvd burner, I have no idea what I'd use for the other spots. Maybe I'll just leave my ssd in one of them and call it good.  There are four slots for hard drives.  I don't know if this is good or not, but since I only had two hard drives and an ssd, it was more than enough for me.  On a side note, I never screwed in my ssd - I just layed it where it was most convenient (since it doesn't have vibration or heat problems, it's fine). Also, I know everyone is complaining about the usb3 cord relay, but I bought an adapter for it (cost about $6) and plugged it straight into the mobo.  Only a slight inconvenience.<br /><br />Here's what I wasn't so happy with:  I probably unplugged everything and rerouted the cables/cords three times trying to find the best way to fit everything without the added clutter. I eventually found a great way to get them all in as long as I taped them flat (no bunching) in the back. I routed most of the cords from the back through the various windows onto the motherboard and whatnot.  Once I knew what I was doing, it wasn't a huge problem. However, I couldn't avoid the cord congestion around the hard drives and graphics card.  Speaking of which, there was a small amount of room between the hard drives and the graphics card.  I had to remove the hard drive case in order to adjust anything on them, and then plugging them back in was a pain.  I ending up having a problem with my mobo, but until I discovered what that was, it was murder trying to get to the sata ports after the drives and gfx card were installed.<br /><br />After I had everything in place and routed correctly, I was very happy with it... until the mobo died - which is not related to the case.<br /><br />Please note, if you're using a gigabyte mobo like I am, you might consider not hooking up the reset button.  You can avoid some boot cycle issues. I guess I'm done with my rabbit trail.re was a small amount of room between the hard drives and the graphics card.

B0081KTI0E|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. The ambiance was eerie and beautifully crafted.<br />The acting was well done and subtle. So nice for a change to embrace the silence<br />of a space and let that be a force unto itself. Loved that choice by the director in<br />this day of sound tracks over running a film.<br />This is a marvelous gothic tale. Loved it!
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I messed around with this thing for a few hours and now it sits next to my Xbox. Didn't do anything to improve the situation, and infact made it harder for my Kinect to recognize things like legs and feet (important in dance games). Plus you have to remove it for video chat if you use it or you look like you're in a fishbowl.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had heard several good reviews of this trilogy from friends but never figured I would get into the book. I enjoy reading so I bought the whole trilogy. I blew threw Fifty shades of Grey, unable to put the book down. Wonderful story and I can't wait to finish the other two books!

B0083SBMBM|5.0|You're larger than life. You have abilities beyond that of most human beings on the planet. Then the world finds itself in peril and to save it, you'll need to join a group of people just as unique as you if not more so. What do you do?<br /><br />  S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is overseeing a top secret project designed to study an energy source from another world known as the tesseract. The experiment soon goes awry and the tesseract appears to explode. In actuality, it has opened a portal allowing the malevolent being known as Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) to emerge. It's almost immediately clear that S.H.I.E.L.D. is outmatched and what's worse, the supervisor of the tesseract project Dr. Erik Selvig (played by Stellan Skarsgard) and experienced covert agent nicknamed Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner) became mindless drones under Loki's (Hiddleston's) command. Once the facility is destroyed and the invaders have moved on, Fury (Jackson) calls Agent Natasha Romanoff also known as the Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) to recruit one member of The Avengers. The Avengers Initiative was abandoned some time before the events depicted in this film, but is reactivated for the sake of mankind and for lack of a better alternative. Romanoff (Johansson) is next seen in India resorting to subterfuge to gain audience with Bruce Banner (played by Mark Ruffalo). Banner (Ruffalo) has gone into hiding to escape opportunists in the American government, to remain calm, to spare the world and those around him any damage he might inflict as The Hulk. Next to be approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. is Iron Man, Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr. in the character's third major film). The last member left to recruit is Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans), more commonly known as Captain America. When they're finally brought together, Banner and Stark are tasked with tracing the energy source and, in so doing, locating the enemy. When that's accomplished, they meet yet another traveler from worlds beyond, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth), Loki's brother.<br /><br />  Now, I was not really a fan of Captain America: The First Avenger, nor was I altogether pleased after seeing Thor. As for Bruce Banner's larger half, perhaps it's impossible to make a film about the incredible hulk that I wouldn't like. First there was the Ang Lee/ Eric Bana film, then the Edward Norton film, both of which I enjoyed. Still, I did like Ruffalo. Also, Thor, Captain America, and the Black Widow made individual contributions to enrich the story. Hiddleston may not be as physically imposing as Chris Hemsworth, but as an egomaniacal extraterrestrial, he is truly terrifying. I can't comment on whether the 3-D effects added anything, as I saw it in 2-D, but regardless, The Avengers was incredible. The one thing I might say was lacking was Iron Man's best friend James Rhodes wearing an armored flight suit of his own and going by the name War Machine. We caught a glimpse of that suit in action in Iron Man 2 but it was nowhere to be seen here and I thought the film was worse off for it. Still, very exciting, highly entertaining, and one great ride.

B0086700CM|5.0|I have never reviewed a game before but I just have to say how much fun I am having playing this game! no lags. no problems. endless fun. you can buy extra coins but I never do that on games and this one is totally fun without it. well worth a five star rating and I would have been happy having paid 3-5 dollars for the game even though I got it for free. happy running!
1742677517|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my mother, who likes to listen to audio books while she drives. This may be a kids' story, but it is poignant and moving in a way that adults can (hopefully) also appreciate. Definitely one of my favorites.
B0081J9OWC|3.0|I'll admit that I didn't get this album for myself, it was more for my wife. But, we both enjoyed the first album for the same reasons. It was energetic, it was fun, it was full of life. Musically, it wasn't spectacular, but it was written well enough to make an overall good album with a good feel and a great sound. Then comes the second album with this project of Ebert, Here. With all of the life and fun heard in the first album, it shouldn't be a surprise that both my wife and I quickly wrote this album off. All of the good from the first album, it wasn't here on... Here. Whereas Up from Below was energetic, fun and lively, Here just seems tepid at best. Sure, the sound (genre[s], if you will) is pretty similar, even if some new direction was taken. The musicality is about the same. But, like how we all get after a long, tiring day, it's like Ebert and Co. just didn't have them any energy left for any more. Then again, some might see it differently, they might say Ebert and Co. grew up, matured, and just left the fun days (read: Up from Below) behind them; in that case, they left behind exactly what I liked about them in the first place. I can see why some would laud this album, but if you happen to only like the first album for the same reasons as my wife and I, I'd steer clear of this. Without the energy of Up from Below, Here is just mediocre.<br /><br />Oh, and another review used the phrase \\"dialed it in.\\" To that I say: EXACTLY!
B0083GCK5G|5.0|I am SO HAPPY that the boys have capped their musical legacy with this wonderful album. It is truly worth the 'Beach Boys' name. They got it right for a few reasons: 1. Brian has creative control. In other words, it isn't bogged down by Mike Love. 2. The arrangements are lush, symphonic and old school. Brian uses the different members' vocal styles as instruments, with different guys singing different parts just like he did way back when. When we do hear Mike, it's because his voice is needed, and it is, as are Al's and Bruce's. Just listen to \\"isn't It Time\\" to hear what I'm saying. 3. Brian is back. The final two songs, which are Brian solos (just like ending Pet Sounds with \\"Caroline No\\"...) are sad songs of loss. The California Dream is long gone. Friends and family are dead. They are reflections are one's own mortality. In other words, for a 50th anniversary album with two Wilson brothers left in the past, it's a perfect ending - rather than some cheesy dance/surf songs. After all, aside from Dennis, they never really did surf anyway.

030796664X|5.0|Each day we make 1000s of decisions.  Most are done without conscious thought or analysis - they are predictable, mundane and routinized patterns.  Understanding the brain's basic wiring and learning how to modify habits is a powerful tool for influencing individual lives, leading teams/organizations and changing society.  Terrific book!
0345522303|5.0|I, like many readers, was delighted when Ms. Flewelling decided to continue Nightrunner with Shadows Return, and was disappointed with the resulting book. The White Road was an improvement, and enough to keep me reading. But with Casket of Souls, she truly returns to the plots and writing that made the original three books so great. Seregil and Alec are back in Rhiminee, and facing complex noble intrigues and a mysterious plague, which only their nightrunning skills is able to uncover. I was enthralled throughout the book, and delighted at the conclusion. Additionally there is also a return to some focus on secondary characters such as Thero, Beka, and Klia, and there was very satisfying development for Thero. An excellent read, leaving me eagerly awaiting the seventh (and final, alas) book.
B0034CNSFU|5.0|Naturally growing up with Jimmy Hendrix I would prefer the original albums. Usually leaving the choice of what is &quot;best&quot; to someone else is precarious at best. However I must agree with their choices as a fare example of Hendrix, and if I were to buy only one album to represent him in my collection this would be it.<br /><br />While many were listing to bubble gum at the time, this was the mainstay for me, even while in the military 1969. As with most people the music brings you back to the time and the issues of the time. Yet there is something timeless in his music and it applies just as well today. I am not going to critique his songs here as everyone has his/her favorite fore one reason or another. Mine is &quot;Watch Tower&quot; for the message.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002P5Y Are You Experienced by Hendrix, Jimi]]
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a very captivating story, interesting and well developed characters. The author reveals the details of the circumstances and scenario piece by piece at just the right time. What others have said was true, I can't put this book down. I began reading the first page at around 11pm, my usual night time reading session which usually lasts an hour or two. But I stopped reading at 5am, and only because of pure exhaustion. Very good read. Definitely worth way more than the listed price.
B007N85ZXY|2.0|I wanted to like this album. It's Neil and the Horse. Usually that's enough for just about anything. In this case, it's not. There are one or two nuggets on this CD, but for the most part it's poorly arranged tunes which at one point even reminded me of the Shocking Pinks.<br /><br />This album is NOT better than the following NY & CH albums: Everybody Knows, Zuma, Rust(s), Hawks and Doves (side 2),  Reactor, Ragged Glory or Sleeps with Angels.<br /><br />At BEST, this album is on a par with the epic \\"Broken Arrow\\".<br /><br />When you find yourself tapping your feet - you realize it's because some of the chords match other material for a brief moment.<br /><br />Highlights(???): The first three cuts, maybe.....(Oh Susannah, Clementine, Tom Dooley).<br /><br />This one is mailed in folks, avoid it. You won't confuse it with the albums listed above......

B002IFT1ZA|1.0|I admit I was lured by the incredible characterization in Martin's novels. You can't help but be drawn in to the tragedy of Bran or Jon or their parents. So for the sake of learning that there might be a happy ending somewhere along the way, I tried to ignore the filthy language and skipped over sections that truly plagued my moral conscience. I finally realized that after pursuing the most recent novel to find out what appropriate end was met by some of the most horrific players in the drama, not only did I get bored but this book contained far more trash than wholesomeness, more pangs to my moral fiber. A little more than half way through it (after skipping more than I read), I deposited it in the trash shute down the hall.<br /><br />I will probably be interpreted as an extremist but I will sleep better at night knowing that I'm not playing with fire anymore. If you are drawn into the story lines of each very long novel, you are being drawn in as a fly to a spider. If you have children, you don't want them looking at this stuff. If you believe that you are what you read, you will never know what I'm talking about. You're safe.

B005LAIHIQ|1.0|Most movies I seen are about average, but this movie wishes it could average! It was a total disaster. I didn't know what kind of movie I was watching as it didn't have a type. It was all over the place. It wasn't like just a hybrid of two movie types, no that would make it good. It was more of a hybrid of 5 movie types and it didn't know what to do during certain situations. For example, you wold think a horror scene is being seen, but all this slack-stick is in the background made it not scary at all. Then, while you think a normal comedy scene is being seen, suddenly comes the horror? Then, you get a ending that seemed more twilight than anything. Yeah, save your time and don't watch or even pay money for this. Unless, you want to support Johnny, Tim, or someone else - it's time to move on.
0380973839|5.0|Of all the authors I have read, three have had an indelible impact on me and my writing-H.P. Lovecraft, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ray Bradbury.  I will never forget the first time I read The Martian Chronicles.

0525478817|4.0|Although the dialogue was more pretentious than a Wes Anderson film, and the cancer plot fairly common, John Green's terrific prose and clever plot twists make this a very good read for adolescents and older.
B0088TG252|3.0|Video/story started out unique and interesting but seems to fall apart somewhat near the end.  The imagery of the scenery of Capetown looked picturesque.  At times it is good action but something is missing and not as great as the hype made it out to be expected.  Some of the parts near the end appeared predictable, to include what happens to a top agent near the end, almost like watching a similar Bourne Identity movie but with the let down.  Sure, it is worth a rental but maybe not for top dollar, and doubt I would buy the video for many replays.  Oh yeah, and the French girl friend actress was lovely!
B005LAIGZU|4.0|The move starts up with an explosive scene in Manilla (literally). Here we get a glimpse of our main protagonist. From there the movie moves to what initially seems like an unrelated series of events taking place in Costa Rica which eventually is the starting point for the whole movie.<br /><br />Since this is NOT a movie review, you can read plenty of those in your local newspapers (sorry to take that line from you Joe Jackson), but what I will say is that the color and visual aspects of watching a movie really come alive on the Blu Ray. While I never saw this movie in the theater, I must say that the colors are vivid and striking on this Blu Ray rendering.<br /><br />The aerial photography of the fast boats moving along the river in Costa Rica is stunning as are the aerial shots of the boats both during and after their extraction too. Shots that take place on the ocean are very breath taking too.<br /><br />If you're looking for a movie with literally non-stop forward movement, this is a move for you. If you're looking for in-depth story and character development, this probably won't be the movie for you. And if you really care about how well the actors portray their parts, this won't be for you either. If, on the other hand, you really want people to portray, accurately, how a SOCOM Operator would really handle themselves, both as an individual and as a unit, this is what you have always craved and are dutifully served. Think of it as a modern version of John Wayne's classic The Green Berets.<br /><br />Overall this is an enjoyable movie and will not disappoint.

But, after starting on Book Three \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" I became annoyed and started thinking that E.L. James really should have left the ending at book two.  I believe the thing that bothered me the most about the books overall is the birth control issue? First, the condoms or foil wrappers...Really?  Could anyone have that much sex in that many positions with a condom and the condom not slip off or break? That was definitely fiction...:))and how could someone be so stupid as to not remember to take a birth control pill each day, especially when she has a smart phone to remind her. ??  And certainly after having the shot they would have called her cell phone to remind her of the appointment for her follow-up and not her office number..and the annoying nickname for the unborn baby \\"Blip\\"...I hated that.!!!  Honestly I didn't think a baby should be brought into such a dysfunctional family.  People think that no one is complete without kids.  I disagree...Not sure if they had a room of pain installed in their new home..I don't recall them saying for sure..but, maybe they installed one just beside the nursery.  :(  And one more thing........SO many women are saying that they want a Christian Grey!!!!  And I ask myself, Why would anyone want someone that is totally possessive, overbearing, arrogant, enjoys inflicting pain on the person he loves and claims he wants to protect....sorry but gorgeousness and gazillions of dollars could not make up for the other pain a person would endure in a relationship with the fictional Mr. Grey...
B00454U1NS|3.0|I bought this CD because I love Pink. She's definitely a guilty pleasure, but it's fun to crank up in the car. The songs on this CD are the songs I grew up with; a nice balance between her early stuff and later songs. So from a music perspective, this is definitely worth it. I'd give the song selection a 5/5.<br /><br />What I cannot stand about this CD is that every time I put it in my disc drive on my laptop or DVD player, everything is in Japanese characters. And it says it's an \\"international\\" edition. I bought it at Target in the US. It's probably a quality control issue and it's not the same for every CD but it's still really annoying. I'd give the actual hardware a 1/5.<br /><br />So I averaged those main points to a 3/5.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy is really edgy... I have found it to be very fasinating and it keeps me wanting to read more! Several ladies and I talk about different parts of the books and it really brings out conversations that would make me blush.
1423140591|5.0|I've read the Percy Jackson series because it was fun and easy to read, but this new series I'm seriously LOVING it.<br /><br />I really enjoyed that we get to see how other people see Percy (since we were used to read from his perspective), he would have never considered himself as someone that inspires fear or respect among others. And I also enjoyed reading about Frank and Hazel as much as Piper & Leo.<br /><br />Riordan was able to keep the same style he had with Percy Jackson series but now is more mature (but don't worry the lines are still very funny, so you'll find yourself laughing every other page)<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to read The Mark of Athena in October.

B00846TTDG|5.0|Acting?! The acting's pretty darned good.  Besides, how can the acting be criticized when these guys are doing what they do in real life?!! It doesn't get anymore real than that, and if you think the current crop of Hollywood poseurs could carry this off and look like they knew what they were doing, you'd be mistaken. It's good to see the good guys in action, and there is no shortage of that in this movie. It's awe inspiring. Definitely a fun film for men.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|Time has it's way of distorting things. Carl Wilson is gone. Brian Wilson was in the middle of a comfortable solo career. And Mike Love was usually on the receiving end of a lot of public trash talk,some of which may actually have a point. Don't know the man obviously so cannot tell. Honestly it seems as if the Beach Boys were definitely a thing of the past. A happy memory coming out of a lot of hard work and agonizing difficulty,but a happy memory none the less. Well out of the blew a month ago I learned that the Beach Boys were about to be a memory no longer. That they were making a comeback. With Brian Wilson fully on board no less. They even bought in David Marks,a very early member of the Beach Boys who may be long forgotten to stand in for the fact that...well Brian is in fact the only Wilson brother left alive. Since,in terms of blunt honesty all of the Beach Boys are now senior citizens the question becomes how can they,at their age would they deal with the baby boom generations now awkward emphasis on the importance of youth? The biggest surprise is that in more than one way this is addressed here.<br /><br />  For starters I expected the music here to be good and interesting. But it's so much more than that. It's like an old friend you thought went away,but just moved around the block a little ways and you never realized it. Brian as always keeps that sea of harmony the band are most known for flowing away. But the songs themselves are both sentimental and genuinely reflective. The title track is very retro in flavor with that doo-wop surf sound of their earliest hits. And it only gets more interesting from there. They sing about escapism on the organ/guitar led southern soul style \\"Spring Vacation\\" (one of my favorites here\\" and on the pop story song \\"The Private Life Of Bill And Sue\\" Brian,Mike,Al and Bruce are all musing with wit and confusion over societies continued obsession with the voyeuristic aspects of reality television. \\"Daybreak Over The Ocean\\" has an easy flowing folk-rock blended into their harmonically rich sound. \\"Beaches In Mind\\" is another favorite of mind here,another rhythmically involved soul oriented number.<br /><br />  However it is on the latter songs here from \\"Strange World\\" to the slower \\"From There To Back Again\\",\\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" and the moving closer \\"Summer's Gone\\" that they bring the point home. These are the same Beach Boys we always knew. Only at a very different stage in their lives. On these songs their looking back with the realization their are fewer years ahead then there are behind. But generally not with a feeling of gloom and doom. Overall there seems to be the overriding attitude that,while they've all faced much loss and a lot of personal trials and tribulations they still wish to preach that optimistic California beach youth culture gospel as long as they can. In this \\"strange world\\" they sing about on this album,there's always a need for...how should I put it? Positively minded reflection in music. There's been enough negativity and anger on all ends. And this represents none of that. It looks back with delight on their past. But also reaches into the present while hoping for a good creative future for other musicians looking to get the same effect with their music. For my own two cents I am glad the Beach Boys made...what will probably be one last album. And though it's is mildly different than what they did in the past I am glad this is the album they chose to make too.\\" has an easy flowing folk-rock blended into their harmonically rich sound. \\"Beaches In Mind\\" is another favorite of mind here,another rhythmically involved soul oriented number.<br /><br />  However it is on the latter songs here from \\"Strange World\\" to the slower \\"From There To Back Again\\",\\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" and the moving closer \\"Summer's Gone\\" that they bring the point home.

B007SGM084|5.0|This is not my normal genre when choosing to sit down & read.  However, I whipped through all three books in less than a month.  I was addicted ... couldn't put 'em down.  I was just happy that I had them available through Kindle .. I was constantly reading it either on my iPhone or Kindle Fire when I was at work.  I wouldn't have been able to pull that off with hard copies.  :)  When I finished with 'Freed', I felt like I was going through withdrawal.  Can't wait for the movie ...
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I preordered this on another side, and got an electronic delivery of it last night.<br /><br />I listed to it, then I listened to it again, then again, and again and now I'm on my fifth play thru.<br /><br />Sonically, its something out of Pet Sounds or SMiLE, Lyrically, its a mishmash, \\"Your Imagination\\" by Brian Wilson reminds me an awful lot of the title track, but on whole it draws from the entire gamut of the Beach Boys repertoire. It really is the best of Pet Sounds, and SMiLE rolled into something new, sonically rich, engaging lyrics, the whole package.<br /><br />Three top picks:<br /><br />Daybreak over the Ocean<br />Beaches in Mind<br />From there and Back<br /><br />So while yes, the music is nostalgic - so much music is - it is NOT nostalgia, its new, fresh and pretty darn amazing, Everyone who likes the Beach Boys should purchase this album, it really is a thing of wonder - and I hope a sign of things to come - I would love to see a 30th Studio Album.<br /><br />(Edited slightly to add three top picks)<br /><br />Postscript - The sole Mike Love penned song - Daybreak over the Ocean - has grown on me,  strongly in fact, it really is an amazing song!

B00003CXC7|5.0|If you watch Hitchcock's Rear Window, you may be deceived into thinking that not much thought went into it.  It's so seamless, you can't see how clever it is.  There are two sets, and they blend into each other.  The whole shebang - Jeff's apartment, the courtyard, and the other apartments the main characters can see into - was filmed on a big soundstage.  The sounds and music in the movie are ambient, what you would naturally hear if you lived in one of those apartments.  This enhances the reality of the setting, and puts the characters and story in the forefront.  We're really there with Jeff, a world-traveling photographer who's laid up with a broken leg and going stir crazy.  That's why we're able to see, almost from the beginning, that things are not what they seem.<br /><br />The screenplay is based on Cornell Woolrich's short story, \\"It Had To Be Murder.\\"  Woolrich was one of the best American short story writers of the 20th Century, a master of suspense.  John Michael Hayes' adaptation is perfect, and I suspect it was shaped as much by the cast as it was by the necessities of the movie medium.  Grace Kelly owns the role of Lisa - I think it's her best role ever.  She's so believable, you know she lives beyond the story, having adventures well into her 90s.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart made several great movies with Alfred Hitchcock, including Vertigo, an almost-perfect movie.  Vertigo is marred by an info-dump scene in which Kim Novak's character writes a letter explaining a plot point.  The studio insisted this was necessary, because the executives who saw the first screening were too dumb to figure out what was going on.  If Hitchcock could have lived long enough to see the \\"Director's Cut\\" videos that have since become the norm, I'm sure he would have insisted on releasing a version without that dopey letter scene in it.<br /><br />Fortunately, Rear Window made it to the final cut without that sort of tampering.  Complementing Kelly and Stewart is a cast of veteran character actors.  Thelma Ritter shines as the visiting nurse, Wendell Corey makes you believe he's a police detective who also fought in WWII.  The actors who play the neighbors whose antics are so fascinating really seem to be living the lives of those people.  And Raymond Burr is one of the scariest movie killers I've ever seen.<br /><br />Though Burr is a big guy, he's not an ax-wielding, snarling, macho kind of killer.  He's clever, quiet, and sneaky.  You don't get a hint of the violence he's capable of until someone actually confronts him.  Even then, you get the feeling he'd rather not mix it up with anyone, he just wants to get rid of the multiple packages that used to be his wife and get on with his new life.<br /><br />Stewart's character is also not a macho guy, though he has a lot of courage.  He's never afraid to say what he thinks, but even if he didn't have a broken leg, you get the feeling Burr could have kicked his butt.  That's what makes the final confrontation between the two so suspenseful.<br /><br />One terrifying moment that stands out in Aliens is the scene where the door to the freight elevator opens.  You suspect the Queen alien is crouched in that shadowy space, but you don't know for sure until you see the light glistening on those dreadful teeth.  In Rear Window, the cinematographer manages to achieve that effect with Raymond Burr's glasses as he steps into Jeff's darkened apartment.  Somehow, this nerd gear is transformed into something really creepy and threatening.  Burr manages to make the salesman sound both pathetic and dangerous when he demands to know who Jeff is and what he wants.<br /><br />Rear Window doesn't have a formal score, unless you count the title sequence (\\"Juke Box #6\\"), a delightful crime-jazz piece written by Franz Waxman in the heyday of the great movie scores.  Otherwise, music plays on the radio, or is sung by drunken partygoers, or is tinkered together on a piano by a struggling songwriter in his rooftop studio.  The song he's working on eventually becomes an integral part of the plot, and by the end of the movie it's \\"Lisa's Theme.\\"<br /><br />The plot threads are woven into a satisfying conclusion, and Jeff and Lisa reach a believable accord in their relationship.  The ending of the movie is every bit as perfect as the beginning.  That's why Rear Window will always make my list of top ten greatest movies.top studio.

B007U1FEJE|4.0|The Beach Boys slow it down a taste , on this new album . \\"Mello but nice\\" . Good to have all the originals back one more time . For Denny and Carl , may they rest in peace ...
B007U1FEJE|4.0|Ever Since 1978's  M.I.U. Album I've become resigned to the fact that The Beach Boys would amount to nothing more than a nostalgic act.  This belief was confirmed with the follow-ups L.A. Light Album (1979) and saccharine-enriched Keeping The Summer Alive (1980).  The sporadic recordings released afterward were mere exercises and reaffirmations of a legacy that was cemented decades before.<br />Now out of the clear blue California sky, the reconstituted, reformed band that includes resident genius Brian Wilson releases an album to coincide with their current world tour.<br />Their recent history suggests that an album, let alone a world tour would have never been considered; but it did.<br />My expectations were low.  Suffering through the debacle that was Summer In Paradise, a horrible shlock-filled effort that even makes the band's most hardcore fans shudder, more of the same would evolve and envelope this album as well.  Turns out I'm only partially right.<br />\\"Think about the Days\\" the wordless, wistful harmony exercise sets the tone of the album and sets up  the program of what's to follow. Ironically, the format they sing about in the title song, is no longer the  viable source that makes or breaks a recording artists career or showcases his or hers talents. Those handful of stations who still spin  Top 40 will unlikely play anything unrelated to the gobbledy-goop that compiles current playlists, so don't expect the Beach Boys' latest offerings to  take residence among them.<br />Though some of the songs are hokey- (\\"Daybreak Over The Ocean\\", a Mike Love discarded solo song and \\"Spring Vacation\\" with the preposterous lyric We're back together/Easy money, ain't life funny  are examples) and others curious (\\"The Private Life of Bill and Sue\\" , \\"Isn't It Time\\" , \\"Strange World\\") It's the final three AOR flavored tracks which close the album that pulls back the record from relative mediocrity.<br />Originally intended to be a suite of Brian Wilson songs under theworking title \\"My Life\\" it's here the tone of album and the entire mood swings off kilter.  The songs -\\"There and Back Again\\", \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" and \\"Summers Gone\\" - are fine examples of Brian Wilson's  best  post - Landy years work, comparable to \\"Lay Down Burden\\" and \\"Midnight's Another Day\\".<br />The young man Wilson wrote about on Pet Sounds who in 1966 was coming to terms of the expectations of growing up  is now an old man  coming to terms of growing old and his inevitable end  itself in 2012. While this is not syrupy nostalgia, it is melancholic drama reminiscent of Wilson masterworks \\"Caroline, No\\" and \\"Til I Die\\".<br /> While its good to see Brian Wilson rightfully take his place at the helm of production and  songwriting (and limiting Mike Love's input) the album still feels incomplete without the contributions of Dennis' song craftsmanship and Carl's angelic vocals, which I believe would have put this effort over the top equaling that of 1970's Sunflower.  That being said, That's Why God Made The Radio as a whole is what one would expect from a modern Beach Boys record: slick production, adequate-not essential-songwriting and the trademark harmonies that became one of American music's lasting legacies.<br /><br />If this is indeed the final Brian Wilson-led Beach Boys album, it is a fitting end.
B002WY65UQ|3.0|Imagine a British all-girls' school filled with misfits & high-jinx a la ANIMAL HOUSE but populated by mostly A and B list British actors...well, imagine no longer! It's here!<br /><br />While it IS decent enough, this movie doesn't quite have enough of the over-the-top aspects to raise it from \\"amusing\\" to \\"hilarious.\\"  Some of the jokes are on the line between \\"wickedly funny\\" and \\"just plain mean,\\" often leaning towards the latter.  [Some of the girls make their own vodka.  When they are told that one person's death was attributed to it, their reaction was akin to \\"So what?\\"  It was kind of hard to \\"root for\\" them after that.]  Most of the characters are either stereotypes or not \\"evolved\\" enough to really \\"care about\\" them...going down the list:  Hot but vacuous/shallow blonde gal, check; cute but really smart 'n' devious twin tweener-girls (think Wednesday Addams times 2), check; goth girl, check; uptight Brit in position of authority, check; plain-Jane new-girl-in-school that turns into \\"hot girl,\\" check; slovenly sleazeball (Russell Brand, of course...like he'd play anything else), and so on.<br /><br />Film fans can play \\"spot the references to other movies\\": THE FLY, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, APOLLO 13, several others.  It's worth a rental, basically.

0618918248|5.0|This book is the clearest and most thoughtful argument against the existence of God I have read. (I teach philosophy so I've read extensively on this topic). Dawkins uses the facts of physical science, probability theory, and studies in the social sciences to make his arguments. He also takes on the usual pro-God positions (intelligent design, the evolution \\"gap\\" theory etc) and gives thoughtful counter-arguments against them minus the vitriol usually found by supporters of theism in popular writings.<br />The chapter on morality was brilliant. Dawkins shows the fallacy in the common assumption that religious belief is necessary for the acquisition of a moral sense. He shows the evolutionary advantages of altruism and other moral qualities which I found to be thoguht-provoking. (Will be using this chapter in my Ethics classes in the future).<br />I could go on and on. READ THIS BOOK...if you dare!

B0073PPKNM|2.0|After enjoying the eye opening \\"One and Only Thrill\\" and \\"Worrisome Heart\\" this album, \\"The Absence\\" is a sidebar. It is more like Bossa Nova and, oh yeah, as an afterthought, Melody Gardot. The title was useful because Gardot was \\"absent\\" from this album. Being bicultural and trilingual, helps me appreciate the effort, but it falls far short of expectations and hype. It should have been a complimentary album to her fans, or a Youtube oddity. Gardot is definitely talented and unique but this unique direction is bizarre and puzzling. If I wanted a Bossa Nova album, I would have gone straight to the source...Brazil! Gardot is just a hyped up publicity version of the real thing.<br /><br />The eleven minute silence is a \\"gypp\\" (New York City slang for \\"fraud). This is neither creative genius nor artistic expression. It is in a word: a fraud! Amazon should be ashamed for selling a CD with silence as \\"music.\\" Federal Courts beware. As a New Yorker, francophile, and musical theatre fan, it does nothing for me. I wanted sultry Jazz and I got snagged in a net of absence. Gardot was more successful mixing the French-American jazz to create her unique style and sound.<br /><br />I look forward to her next album. There are about two classically \\"Melody Gardot\\" tracks: \\"My Heart Won't Have It Any Other Way\\" and \\"Goodbye.\\" This is what I want to say to this album...\\"goodbye!\\" I'll be more careful next time I \\"bye\\" a Gardot tune (pun intended).

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I love Joe Walsh as well as Jeff Lynne, therefore I am already a fan of Analog Man. I have only received the vinyl version to date which has only the 10 tracks,the CD deluxe edition is still on it's way to me.<br />Jeff Lynne has certainly kept his polished production well disguised to the point where certain tracks like Analog Man and Wrecking Ball could have been produced by Joe himself.<br />One Day At A Time and Spanish Dancer sound a little more like the older 90's Jeff Lynne sound.<br />Joe sounds great on the album and he is obviously at a very happy point in his life. my favourites on the album are the title track, One Day At A Time, Lucky That Way, Spanish Dancer, Family and Wrecking Ball. Would had preferred it if Jeff Lynne had produced the entire album but I am so grateful it has finally been released and on both CD and vinyl formats.<br />Now we wait with baited breath for Jeff Lynne's new work apparently coming later in 2012.

B002N8A14M|2.0|The Good:  You get a quality product for the price.  I like that the I-Pod holder can be removed from the armband and worn on your belt.  Armband can be sized to fit all arm sizes.<br /><br />The Bad:  I don't know what they designers of this product were thinking when they designed it. It is supposed to be custom fitted for the I-Pod 5 but:  (1) The case at the bottom does not allow you to plug in a non Apple headset (already mentioned).  (2) The ridges at the top of the case makes it very difficult to use the lock slide switch.<br />So, if you don't mind shaving the top and bottom of the case when you get it, buy this product.  If not, buy something else.  I wish I did.  I shouldn't have fix a custom product designed for my unit.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I read a ton of Edgar Rice Burrough's books years ago when I was in college, including his \\"Princess of Mars\\" series.  They are fun action-adventure, escapist reads.  They are not and do not claim to be great literature, but at the same time they have staying power.  I mean, who hasn't heard of Tarzan?  Anyway, his \\"Princess of Mars\\" series is lesser known, but equally fun and engaging.  They, like Tarzan, are great summertime reads!  I was therefore excited to see that Disney was releasing \\"John Carter\\" (which is based on the \\"Princess of Mars\\").  I don't remember seeing much hype about this movie before it came out in the theater, but I went to see it anyway, and I really, really liked it.<br /><br />OK, I readily admit that some of the special effects are little hokey, but all in all it's a really fun show!  There are all kinds of aliens, there's danger, intrigue, mystery, comic relief, loyalty, a hero, and even some romantic tension tossed in to flavor the mix.  And, if you are into steam punk at all, you'l like the effects.  They have a very strong steam punk flavor to them.<br /><br />The basic story line (without revealing anything major) is that John Carter, a Civil War hero, suffers great personal loss, so he flees to the western territories and sets out to find gold.  He is a person adrift.  He detaches himself from everyone and everything from his past.  He is a person of strong character, but has become disillusioned.  He then finds himself on Mars (you'll have to watch to see how that happens).  Mars is a smaller than Earth, and has less gravity, so John Carter, an Earthling, has great advantages when it comes to strength, speed, etc.  Once on Mars it's not long before he stumbles into the middle of a war and finds himself confronted with a decision about whether to commit himself or not.<br /><br />I found the characters, even the digitally animated ones to be realistic and engaging.  And, if you are like me, you will love Woola.  Woola is, according to John Carter, a \\"nice...monster dog\\".  You'll see.<br /><br />This movie is not dark like many sci-fi movies tend to be these days.  It's fun, hopeful, and a great romp.  You'll love the ending!<br /><br />I was going to award this movie 4 stars when I started writing my review, but as I went on I convinced myself that it's actually worth 5!<br /><br />As for an appropriate audience...um, I'd say that it's probably best for viewers over the age of 12.  My 13-yr old daughter and I watched it together, and we both liked it.  Then my college aged daughter and I watched it and she really liked it too.<br /><br />I hope this was useful!

B007P6VM04|3.0|To everyone out there, be careful before you buy this.  There are only a handful of songs you'd ever want to hear on a CD, namely the original songs from SMASH.  The rest, and the majority, are just cover songs, i.e. karaoke.  At least Megan Hilty has some energy, but hearing Katharine McPhee sing these covers with her dull style reminds you why you didn't like her post American Idol albums either.  Let Me Be Your Star is good but you should probably just buy the original songs as MP3 stand-alones and forget the rest.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I read this back in high school some 50+ years ago so there was a lot I forgot and kept getting it mixed up with Huckleberry Finn but I enjoyed reading it after all these years. Sometimes it's nice to go back and read the classics, they're written so differently from today's books.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|The first and last song grabbed me from the start.  Her sound is so unique, like a cross between Adele and Sade. Not that she sounds like either of them. She has her own style which is so refreshing in a time when so much of popular music sounds the same. \\"Easier in Bed\\" is one of the sexiest songs I've heard in a long time. Not sure why this Amazon version has a different ending song than the iTunes version but I like this one better.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|What a treasure! It was light and dark, romantic and heartwarming but it was also full of suspense. The story is set in New York and it is close to urban fantasy but with a wonderful, wonderful love story.<br /><br />I want to stay in this wonderful world. It is filled with magic, elves, one hot dragon and all kinds of other magical creatures. Unfolding Pia's secret is like opening the most beautiful present.<br /><br />And Pia is one of the best heroines: she is funny, sane, resourceful and pure good. I would love to have her as my friend. And Dragos. He was some swoon-worthy, hot dragon. He was completely clueless, totally smitten and fiercely protective of Pia. And more importantly, they are perfect for each other.<br /><br />I can't describe this book and it was nothing like the book I expected. It was so much better. Super funny. Almost completely angst-free without the big misunderstandings. Awesome scenery. I found new friends, a perfect book holiday location and a new series to follow *big grin on my face*
0345803485|4.0|Was this a good book? Yes. Is this book well written? No.<br /><br />While reading this book, I found myself comparing this book to the Twilight saga. This book is set in Seattle rather than Forks. Although this is about college instead of high school. Ana lived with her step-dad instead of her Mom so that her Mom could have time alone with her new husband. It is past tense in this book rather than current situation like in Twilight and it is her step-Dad rather than Dad, but close enough. Her Step-Dad is quiet and loves fishing. Her mom is a little hair brained and has been married multiple times. Her Moms new man gets hurt and she can't come to her graduation. Christian is rich, buys her a new car, he's a stalker, etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />A few things that annoyed me about this book... he frowns, she bites her lip, she blushes, and they roll their eyes way too much. They gasp and their breath hitches continuously. I also hated the fifty shades this, fifty shades that references.<br /><br />Ana is suppose to be 21 years old and still a virgin. I can see that maybe happening. She has never touched herself, never had an orgasm. James makes it sound like she doesn't even know what an orgasm is. What 21 year old is that sex-dumb?<br /><br />Christian knows she is a virgin and rams into her like a bull and she loves it? What?! I can't see any man being that mean and I can't see a virgin coming back for more let alone falling for him.<br /><br />Oh, and once she does start having orgasms, all he has to do is look at her and she has one? I think not! For once I wish someone would write a sex scene that is actually realistic.<br /><br />Now, with that being said. This book was full of hot, steamy, kinky, in-depth sex scenes. It is interesting, isn't a slow read, keeps you wondering what will happen next, and the end I almost teared up.<br /><br />Will I read the other books? You betcha!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is soo awesome you should totally get it!&iexcl; this game allows you to play multiple games at once so cool
1573228737|5.0|Wow. This novel drew me in from the start. I found it difficult to put down and Waters maintained that grip until the very end. The setting (Millbank Prison) was skillfully written so the reader experienced the horrors through the eyes of protagonist, Margaret Prior. I enjoyed Waters knowledge of Victorian Spiritualism. SPOILER ALERT - I hoped for a different outcome simply because the ending broke my heart for these characters. Well written. Wonderfully researched. A MUST READ for anyone interested in the mysterious world of Victorian Spiritualism, the brutality of 19th century prisons, and a lesbian woman struggling to find love in a time when such things were taboo. Loved it. I'll definitely read more books by the amazingly talented Sarah Waters.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for it to be on the kindle fire and now it is. Also it is very addicting.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very entertaining book, but not as captivating as the first in the series.  Still worthy of the read.  Anastasia and Fifty still teach us the many ways of a relationship with a Dom.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I like this game because its fun and you don't have to pay to play. you can play with whoever you want.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|The best thing about the $100 start-up is the way it walks people through starting their own business.  It seems as many Mom & Pop shops have closed, there's other people right behind them, willing to take the risks and rewards of doing their own thing, and this book has great ideas for maximizing the upsides.  Some folks sitting in jobs that hate never seem to think they have what it takes to take the plunge and do their own thing, and this book helps folks see it's possible with what they have at hand.  The marketing and digital marketing advice, including how to set up a killer offer are things every business owner should know, (non profits as well.)  If you are thinking about doing your own thing, this is a great guide to pick up and have along the path.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally they made it for the kindle! I love this game so much on the I pod and now finally it's on my kindle fire!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Once again, I allowed popular opinion to entice me to read a book that I nearly put down after just the first page. WHAT THE HELL ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE YAMMERING ON ABOUT?  Was this a joke? The writing in \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is so immature, I thought it had been penned by a gushy teenager.  The  characters were inadequately drawn and unrealistically portrayed: An incredibly gorgeous 26 year-old SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE (because to be a millionaire was clearly not enough) who got his start as a crack-baby... REALLY? Yet this incredible breathtaking and accomplished man who seemingly spends no time running his mysterious empire is intrigued by a clumsy, tackily dressed, recent college grad with bad hair, a muscle-less body, and bad eating habits who works in a hardware store. Go figure.  The book's characterizations were simplistic and repetitive: \\"bottom-lip-biting\\" (which must have appeared 4000x), \\"loose-tendril tucking\\", \\"blushing\\", and \\"eye flashing\\" (whatever that is) sum up the way the two main characters communicate their emotions. The \\"contract\\", revised versions of the contract, and excerpts from the contract dominate the pages throughout, way after the reader has already gotten the point. And the female character is so in her own head, I would have loved to not know what she was thinking for a change, but by then it was too late, I had already decided she was an imbecile. Her \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious\\" were so in command of her character that one of them should have taken her to a psychiatrist (or an exorcist, you pick).  I was so sick of her self-deprecating musings, that when she uttered \\"Crap,\\", I wholeheartedly agreed. It was, and remains, just that. If this had been an actual physical book (and not on my Kindle) I would have flung it out the bus window.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games don't have stages like other games do you can only play the game once. but it is really easy to get points.
0062060562|5.0|This book caught my eye on the \\"NEW\\" rack at my local library so I grabbed it and added it to my check out pile.<br /><br />It was a few days before I got around to reading it, but once I started, I couldn't put it down. Other reviewers have said that this book is nothing new and mention 50 First Dates and Momento. True, this book is about a person with amnesia who wakes up each day not know who they are or where they are, but there are glaring differences.<br /><br />This is the story of Christine, except, her story keeps changing. I won't give much in the way of plot, because it's all been said and done. I just wanted to give this book the props it deserves. These days, I rarely find a book that intrigues me and makes me want to read it, staying up way too late to finish a chapter and waking up thinking about what will happen next. Before I Go To Sleep is one of those books.<br /><br />Obviously not everyone will love it, but chances are, you will.
B002RI9PKO|3.0|A thought provoking book about what the \\"recipe\\" for success is.  Definitely worth reading when you have small children or are planning a family.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I'm satisfied with the design and functionality of this cover.  It's well designed and the simple strap keeps it in the 3 available positions (open, closed, propped up).  It's not particularly secure when propped up, and it picks up fingerprints too easily, but other than that it does the job well.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|i really like this game but the only prob. is is that no 1 will ply w/ me :( oother than that AWSOME!!!!!

0345803485|5.0|I just finished the trilogy, mind you in less than 5 days. It's one of the most amazing, heart breaking, love stories that will leave you wanting more. It's absolutely beautiful. I was unsure of what I was getting myself into at first after hearing others talk about it, but I assure anyone that it is much much much more than you can imagine. Start the first book, and you won't stop until you've finished them all.

B0034G4P1W|3.0|As a big fan of Aardman Animations, I had high hopes for The Pirates! Band of Misfits.  Unfortunately, this film is more a bundle of misfires than anything else.  It's one of those films where, if you've seen the trailer, then you've already seen ninety percent of what's worth seeing in the film.<br /><br />Directed by Peter Lord and Jeff Newitt and written by Gideon Defoe, there's something missing from this film.  What's missing is Nick Park, who was writer and/or director on all of Aardman's best films, from the Wallace & Gromit and Creature Comforts short films to their feature films like The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and Chicken Run.  Park was also the missing element from Aardman's notably less successful films like Flushed Away and Arthur Christmas.  All of the humor and heart and cohesive consistency that Nick Park brings to his projects is absent here.  And boy does it show.<br /><br />The nominal plot centers around The Pirate Captain (that's his name, not his title) and his crew of misfits who sail the seas in an apparently nameless (one of many, many oversights in this film) ship in 1837 when Queen Victoria ruled the British Empire.  Ignoring for the moment the fact that the golden age of piracy actually ended a hundred and fifty years before this film is set, The Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) is on a quest to win the coveted Pirate of the Year award, which goes to the pirate who accumulates the most plunder. His arch rivals in this endeavor are fellow pirate lords Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) and Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek).  After a truly miserable run of pirating - boarding a leper ship, a ghost ship, and a ship of nudists among others, none of which have anything to plunder - The Pirate Captain ends up boarding the HMS Beagle where he encounters none other than Charles Darwin (David Tennant).  Darwin recognizes the pirates' parrot Polly as not being a parrot at all but instead a dodo, a bird that, thought by all to be long extinct, would be the zoological find of the century.  This turn of events takes the pirates to London where they run afoul of Queen Victoria (Imelda Staunton), ruler of the British empire with a sworn hatred of all things pirate.  Not to mention a taste for, shall we say, quite rare cuisine.<br /><br />The animation - mostly stop-action claymation with some CGI added in - is up to the usual high Aardman Animations standards.  But it's what's going on within the film and the characters that falls woefully short.  The best way I can describe Band of Misfits is that it's like listening to a stand-up comic whose timing is awful, who doesn't know his audience, and who now and then ends up forgetting the punch-line entirely.  I mean, you listen, and you know the jokes are _supposed_ to be funny, but the way they're delivered they're just... not. And also lacking is heart.  There's no real emotional depth or even substance to most of the characters, leaving them largely one-note jokes that wander aimlessly from scene to scene.  As an example of an undelivered punch-line, one of the crew - The Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate - is obviously a woman pretending to be a man by wearing a fake beard.  But that's all there is.  Lord and Defoe never go anywhere with it; she's never revealed as a woman, she's never in a situation where her being a woman matters in any way, they just have her there as part of the crew, a one-note joke lacking a punch-line for the entire film.  Also wasted was Salma Hayek's Cutlass Liz who definitely catches one's interest - and eye - when she makes her sexy-and-dangerous entrance early in the film... only to pretty much disappear for the rest of the movie until the end when the Pirate of the Year winner is announced. The same goes for Jeremy Piven's Black Bellamy - big flashy whale of an entrance, then nothing to do for the rest of the movie.  And as for not knowing the audience, a lot of the jokes are Darwin/evolution jokes that are going to go right over the heads of any kids, who would seem to be the principle market for the film.  They also won't make the adults laugh either because they're executed so badly.<br /><br />As far as the 3D aspect goes, once again, the 3D here - as in so many recent releases - adds absolutely nothing to the film and amounts to a complete waste of money trying to make a mediocre film seem like more than it is.<br /><br />About the only positive thing I can say about Band of Misfits is that it was genuinely funny to not only see Queen Victoria cast as the villain but also to see her spring into flying ninja two-sword combat mode in the climactic battle scene.  It was also good to hear Brian Blessed's inimitable bass bellow as The Pirate King, even if he only had one scene to use it in. But these two things don't make up for the rest of the movie, not by a long shot.  Band of Misfits is definitely a missed fit on Aardman's part.  It's not as bad as Flushed Away was, but it's nowhere as good as any of the Nick Park films were.<br /><br />Recommended only for die-hard Aardman Animations fans and for anyone who's always wanted to see what Queen Victoria as an arch-villainess would be like.o would seem to be the principle market for the film.

B007SGM084|5.0|I've never read anything like these books!  I have enjoyed the story-line but still can't wrap my head around the frequency of their \\"encounters\\" and the places and items involved. Do other couples really have that kind of appetite?!?  Who cares?!  I've enjoyed these books!
0345803485|5.0|I normally do not jump on the bandwagon when new books come out..however, with all the reviews and comments from friends, I took the plunge and bought Fify Shades of Grey..at first I was stunned, but then was intrigued enough to learn more about Christian and Ana.  I have since read all 3 books and book 3 is by far my favorite..what starts as dark and dominate turns into beautiful love.  This book takes you out of your comfort zone one minute and brings you back with the 'hearts and flowers'.  It made me wonder how far I would be willing to go for the man I love...hmmm..
1400052181|5.0|I expected that the Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks would be as boring as what follows when (all too often) someone says to me, \\"Oh, you're a doctor, let me tell you about my Aunt Clara you would be fascinated; she has this....\\" Far different, the book  was engrossing. On two planes. One was the medical story. Although I had been aware of HeLa cells were, I had no idea of the breadth of their impact. And that part of the story was told so anyone from the ordinary reader to the professional would find interesting. The other plane was what happened to the Lacks family, stemming from a profound cultural disconnect. The Lackses wildly misread the medical information, and proud members my profession were insensitive, dismissive, and brutal by neglect. I wonder if we, in medicine and more broadly, are equally constrained by our own current culture and personally driven by our own unacknowledged self interests. And I wonder if, with passage of time and cultural change, our behavior would be seen as equally appalling? There's hope - the author, of a substantially different culture from the Lackses, shows substantial, empathetic respect for them - or was there self-interest there as well?
0345803485|1.0|If Twilight was elevated to become the best work of fiction ever made fifty shade of grey would rise to the relative level of bird cage lining.<br /><br />Yes I read the 3 books, mostly out of morbid curiosity to see just how bad it could get.<br /><br />Mommy porn, as I've seen it called, may be a perfect description for this. It has all the redeeming qualities of porn, and the story is just as believable. It would explain how it could achieve best seller status; it isn't for the engaging story, or well developed characters.<br /><br />Even the best fiction requires a suspension of disbelief, but usually the author works with you to maintain it, this one seemed intent on getting you to give up that suspension and simply not believe.<br /><br />Oh how I wish I had found Fifty shades of suck first.

076781326X|5.0|This movie is incredibly sad, yet you feel a sense of hope in the boy, Oliver. The songs are catchy and the timing is perfect!
B003RV43X4|3.0|I admit that I somewhat enjoyed this swords-and-sandals action flick when I saw it in theaters a couple of years ago, hence the three stars, but having done some research on the original mythology, I'm upset over how they cast Andromeda, Perseus's love interest. In the original Greek myths, Andromeda was a princess from \\"Aethiopia\\", which is what the Greeks called Sudan---which as everyone should know by now is a tropical African country. In fact the very word \\"Aethiopia\\" meant \\"burnt faces\\" in reference to the inhabitants' skin color. Thereby Andromeda would have been a dark-skinned African woman, not Nordic-looking as portrayed in Clash. By depicting Andromeda as white in spite of the original mythology, the filmmakers eschewed a chance to have a more multicultural cast starring a European male/African female couple in favor of a generic white female love interest, which is insulting to black women. The action and special effects may be good but I cannot forgive such borderline racist casting and will boycott the franchise until they get Andromeda's ethnicity right.

B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to hit the amazon appstore and it finally did. this game deserves to be # 1 on the list it is totally awesome if you've never played this game download immediately. one tiny problem is that if your playing music and playing the game it lags and this being a game that requires precise that creates a problem but overlooking that this is a great game
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I avoided this in the theaters based on the CRAP advertising. I am glad that I did. I purchased solely based on Amazon.com  reviews (thanks, reviewers!) and feel happy to report my pleasure with this film. Disney lost out on millions (I am sure) with the terrible advertising plan. I am sure that they will still make millions based on our positive reviews and word-of-mouth about this excellent, engrossing film. I just watched it with my 19-year old and 5-year old daughters; it held the attention of all of us. Great CGI effects, superb acting, interesting story, no sex/profanity, etc. All win-win in my opinion. Will share my feelings with my co-workers; expect more sales, Amazon.
1582701709|4.0|First the good stuff: This is an inspiring work that can serve to motivate and fire up someone who just needs to be more positive. There is a lot of evidence that positive thinking and the correct mental attitude can make all the difference between being a depressed loser and being a joyful winner in all areas of life. This book takes on that directly and shows how to be a joyful winner.<br /><br />Any problems? Yes, the author doesn't distinguish between a metaphor and reality. I get the idea that the author CAN'T distinguish between a metaphor and reality. Mental attitude is mental, it affects your thoughts and your actions. This is critical and is probably all you need to go from being stuck and hopeless to getting everything you want. But this books pushes past that to claiming what is basically magic powers, the ability to affect remote physical objects. This is not necessary, and is a big turn-off to someone who is firmly grounded in physical reality. And you don't need to claim magical powers, it isn't required: \\"merely\\" changing your own thoughts, actions, bodylanguage etc is enough to achieve marvelous things, so going this much further is gilding the lilly.<br /><br />Sadly I can't really haven't found another book that does approach this subject in a way that I appreciate. The best treatment I've found has been as asides in various Sales training literature.

B000077VR3|2.0|Bought a second copy of the DVD hoping the sound defect was a fluke, but both copies, no matter what tv I played them on, had terrible sound balance issues.  Ruined the songs!!!  The orchestration completely drowned out the voices, unlike on the cd and in theaters where it sounded fantastic.

B007KOYEOC|4.0|I have read all three of the \\"Fifty Shades\\" books....twice. I think the Fifty Shades Freed is my favourite.  There is a hell of a lot of sex in these books, so if you are in any way \\"uncomfortable\\" with reading about it, these are not the books for you.  I love Christian's flawed character, I find him very endearing and I love the plot's small reveals throughout the book.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a blast. I'm usually a word game/Angry Birds/Bejeweled kind of a gal but Temple run is a fun change. I have no complaints.
1612130283|4.0|Well, I have to say sadly, that I have not read a book in about 35 years, it was just not my thing, but after all the hype over this book I decided to give it a go. I read the first book in a week, it seemed that every spare minute I had I was picking up that book. It certainly has a way of sucking you in. Now as I said I am not a book reader, so I really can't make any judgement calls on how well it is written etc, but I have to tell you I am loving it. It's not the sex or any one thing inparticular, it just keeps you coming back for more.  I have just started the second book and I look forward to reading it as often as I can.  Give it a try.
B00884GR0W|4.0|this game is almost a clone of minecraft and I'm a big fan of it, but for some reason ( I bought the full version ) and block story keeps telling me that I should buy the full version, and if this didn't happen to you, you must have a good system. also, it erased the worlds I made. but my items are still there. if I didn't have this problem, I would've given this game 5 stars.

B007SGM084|4.0|Take Jackson Browne's Hold Out album, cut out \\"Of Missing Persons\\" and you will have the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy in song.<br /><br />The alleged \\"deviant sex\\" in these books usually rates a vanilla plus rating.  People in lust do it everywhere, and people who are familiar with each other and think sex is fun experiment.  It was an interesting story, but I felt it was not very realistic (except the part about Leila being crazy), and therefore could be leading women on.  I'm 84% done with the third, and I did stay up 3 days to read it because it was fairly well written, even though, to me, truly fiction with a one in a million chance of finding a Christian.  If it's made into a movie, the Hold Out album should be the soundtrack.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A great read of what the SEALs get up to and in to! Authentic and down-to-earth. Describes the rigor of training and how this is applied in real conflict.  Also covers the human side of dealing with war.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Much as with the Twilight saga and The Hunger Games trilogy, my curiosity was piqued by the supposedly hot and dirty Shades of Grey series. I like to be \\"in the know\\" with respect to these pop culture books. I had heard the Fifty Shades is quite the steamy fare, yet soccer moms read it unapologetically on the bleachers at their kids' games.<br /><br />My take on Fifty Shades of Grey is that it's pretty vanilla \\"erotic fiction\\". This is a naughty book for the folks who think \\"Black Swan\\" is a particularly dark and edgy film. The writing is marginally better than that of Twilight, and E. L. James seems to have drawn entirely from Stephenie Meyer the inspiration for her protagonist. Bella Swan and Ana Steele are sisters from another mister, sharing Converse sneakers, physical clumsiness, divorced parents with Dad in small town Western Washington and Mom in the sunny South, not to mention a deep-rooted complex that they aren't aesthetically gifted enough or otherwise worthy of their suitor. Yet somehow in the fantasy worlds of Twilight and Grey, women who are mopey and antagonistic  come across as insightful and brave. How can I move there?!<br /><br />Oh wait - I already live there. Geographically speaking. E. L. James hails from the West London and it shows in the stilted British dialogue of her characters. They speak a Pacific Northwest dialect the way I speak Swahili. Even the general Seattle references are laughable...nobody here refers to \\"the Pike Place Market District\\". Seattle doesn't have districts, it has neighborhoods, and anybody who has lived here for five minutes knows that Pike Place is simply known as \\"The Market\\".<br /><br />Criticisms aside, James does a reasonably good job developing a plot that spurs the reader to see things through. Whereas I'm more than over hearing about Ana's lip-biting habit, how Christian's pants hang \\"that way\\", any reference to the main characters' eye colors and the word \\"mulishly\\", I'll follow through on the next couple of books to see how this story ultimately ends.books to see how this story ultimately ends.

B00004STPT|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movie soundtracks-- it's very stirring, powerful and appropriate to the tone, action, and period of the movie itself. I love Hans Zimmer's other stuff as well-- his work on the first \\"Pirates of the Carribean\\", and both of the \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" movies were also really exciting and lively soundtracks and I'd highly recommend all of them; not all movie soundtracks are good enough to listen to separate from the film itself, but Zimmer's stuff is so good and so evocative of the scenes that they represent, that they can be listened to for pure enjoyment all by themselves!
B0086700CM|5.0|Really amazing game! I'm hooked. Cannot stop playing XD Does have a slight problem with lag but mostly just when my battery is low.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its a nice escape during the day or at night before bed.... Two thumbs up.Its also a good ice breaker everybody should experience this super fun app
B00479SVBU|5.0|I decided to go with this product due to the fact that it had such great reviews. I now know why. The product arrived on time and works great. I'm not experiencing any static noises and it has amazing sound quality. I am so happy with this product!
0345803485|2.0|I found this story really frustrating due to the repeated use of annoying phrases and descriptions, oh my!<br /><br />I started to cringe every time Ana mentioned her inner goddess or subconscious talking to her! Some people probably found it `cute' but I found it annoying and distracting.<br /><br />I read a few didn't like the ending as they would have to wait for book two to see what was going to eventuate. I really couldn't care less, especially about Ana, and do not intend to continue with the series.<br /><br />On the plus side I enjoyed Christian's character and the sex was hot, 2 stars for that.
B0086700CM|5.0|a challanaging game with simple controls. story: you steal an artifact called the idol. demon monkeys who protect the idol are chasing you while you collect coins. the coins are used to buy in-game items such as coin magnets,coin upgrades,characters and more.
0345803485|5.0|Ive purchased all three! I love them!!! Just started a book club, and these are our first novels. Everyone is fascinated with them!
0345803485|1.0|I think I lost at least 20 I.Q. points after reading this junk! I hung in till the end hoping I would find out what makes Christian tick.I was left feeling let down and dumbed down. I'll sum up the plot: Ana and Christian meet, she rolls her eyes, bites her lip, they have sex, Ana cries. Now repeat x 10!<br /><br />This book had the most shallow character development I can recall in recent years. Sweet Valley high books have more depth. I believe Christian is a rip off of Patrick Bateman in  American Psycho. Ana has the personality of pond scum. As far as the hot sex, the first couple scenes were hot then it just got repetitive and boring. I found the bathroom scene at the hotel in Georgia downright repulsive! I am not naive or a prude by any means!
B007OWG3LM|5.0|My first impression of the new album Valtari by Sigur Ros was underwhelming to say the least. I fired myself up to write a three star review and complain about the sad decline of the once brilliant Icelandic band. After my first listen, I agreed with fans who described the music as pretty but uninspiring. This, coming from artists who invented a genre of emotional music as moving and innovative as any created.<br /><br />I was determined to have the music on the new disc move me with the same impact I felt from  Agaetis Byrjun,() and Takk. I kept anticipating the barren cold textures, the unexpected sweeping turns and finally, the breathtaking climaxes (the \\"I need a cigarette kind!\\") It never happened; what a disappointment.<br /><br />Then something else happened...After an extremely tiring yet pleasurable surf session, I decided to try Valtari again. Exhausted, I closed my eyes and listened without expectations. By the second track, Ekki Mukk, I felt as if a door had been opened. Next, Varuo completely took me over (tears escaped my closed eyes.) I started seeing colors. I felt as if I was still in the Pacific riding waves. The music, just like surfing, had picked me up and moved me. In the ocean, one can not make a wave. When listening to Sigur Ros, the listener can't make the music move them.<br /><br />My assessment: The first five tracks pour in, a liquid steamroller. Jonsi's vocals rise and fall like an ocean wave. The final three songs are mostly instrumental and lovely, almost like one merging outro. These last three, a sailboat riding the tide out and taking the listener to relative safety of the sea. The soft ending is welcome after the beauty and glory by the shore.<br /><br />Please excuse the dramatic metaphors; I know it sounds pretentious. But every word and sound rings true for me. So please, long-time fans, give the record a chance; don't compare it to their storied past. Newbies: just get on board and enjoy the ride...
B006RUJST6|5.0|Slammed is an absolute treasure. I love this book! READ IT.<br /><br />Lake is still grieving over the loss of her dad, and now she's being forced to leave her home in Texas to move to Michigan. She is clearly not happy about this. When Lake, her mom, and her little brother, Kel, arrive at their new home, they meet their new neighbors. Meeting Will suddenly makes the move across the country feel a whole lot better.<br /><br />Lake and Will are drawn to each other from the very beginning. Their instant connection is sweet and consuming. They go on an incredible date and Lake is taken aback at how different Will is from other guys. Their feelings for one another grow quickly and they each seem to fill a void in the other. However, they soon discover a major obstacle that forces them apart. But how far apart can they really get when their little brothers have become best friends and they live across the street from each other?<br /><br />Life and death, love and loss, laughter and tears...there's a plethora of emotion on every page. (I was bawling at one point. Get your tissue ready.) The poetry is beautiful and inspiring and the advice is priceless. Slammed is definitely a MUST READ, and reread, because we all need to learn how to stop \\"carving pumpkins\\" at some point.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to read Point of Retreat next.
B00884GR0W|3.0|What the heck...... I paid for the full version to only get the &quot;Lite&quot; version. Please fix this issue Mind Blocks. Buyer Beware!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|he says he likes it. It is addicting but fun.  I had to turn off the notifications because there were too many.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|Excellent album from Carlos Santana, lots of perfect instrumentals 5 stars +++++++<br />I would love to go on his concert for sure also.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|[[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]]<br />Heard about this from friends who saw the movie and couldn't resist reading the books. My initial reaction was must be for kids but once I got into the story couldn't put it down.  Fantastic view of what could be given the current state of world affairs!! Glad it is only fantasy.
B002N1RM5A|4.0|I am new to Kauffmann and have not followed his career at all. I heard him for the first time singing \\"Che gelida manina\\" and was positively \\"Wow'd\\" at the size of this man's voice. He has tenor range with the power and resonance of a baritone.<br /><br />This cycle I have had in my collection for years and my benchmark is the Fischer-Dieskau/Moore recording, so I come to this completely different treatment with my own personal bias and, as much as I enjoy this version and Kauffmann's enormous voice, the thought went through my head that what seemed to be missing was the earthiness and rusticity that DFD brought to his giving. The question is begged (to me at least - and probably unanswerable) as to whether a voice so big, so full, so operatic, can do justice to what Schubert had in mind when he composed this music and sculpted the story of a young wayfarer who falls in love with a simple miller's daughter.<br /><br />I think what I'm saying is that Kauffmann's voice is heroic, not lyric, in its qualities. Is it a \\"schubertian\\" voice? I don't think so. Nonetheless, listening to him mesmerizes me and I'm not at all unhappy to have bought this version.<br /><br />It is different, not better or worse, than my benchmark. An alternative, and a pleasant one at that.<br /><br />The accompaniment is flawless in every way. In my youth as a music student I once accompanied a young baritone singing Die Sch&ouml;ne M&uuml;llerin so I am particularly attentive to the piano. Mr. Deutsch plays with great precision and great sensitivity. Smooth as silk.
B0080CL0HM|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much! I definitely recomend seeing it! The cast was great, and the plot is catching. The score is extremely loud though.
B007AL48UK|5.0|This version makes me think of a day at the beach.  Easy symbols to match - easier than the traditional symbols.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|helps pass time but at the same time can be repetive having to play a game several times in order to unlock more games but I guess that's the point
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Love this movie. Bought it for my mother-in-law, she loved it too. would recommend to others in a heartbeat. This is a great view for any who have not seen it before
0553386794|5.0|The Game of Thrones is a great novel! It's full of political scandal, magic, love, sex, and violence, anyone who reads this book will have a field day with the intricacies of the plot. What I liked most about the novel was that the plot involved more than one story at a time and each story somehow connected to the other stories, either through politics, love, violence, magic, or sex. I also loved Martin's writing style and how he structured the book. Martin organizes the book by chapters and he focuses each chapter around a specific character in the novel ( i.e. chapter names like Arya, Jon, Tyrion, Eddard, etc.). Furthermore, Martin uses third person limited when writing the novel so that the reader can know the thoughts and feelings of the character the chapter is focus around, and so that the reader is kept guessing regarding the thoughts and feelings of the other characters until their chapters are reached or until their thoughts and feelings are later revealed in the plot. The best aspect of the Game of Thrones was that each chapter revealed a new twist or revelation in the plot. Each character always has something new and interesting to add to the plot, whether it is a piece of key information that connects multiple stories, or a character's actions that causes a ripple effect throughout the other stories in the book, or a twist in the story of the character that changes the course of the entire plot completely. This book is NEVER boring and once started it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to put down!
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|Allow me to add my voice to the many who failed to understand why the critics hated this film. It was fantastic! I purchased it dubiously, taking a risk by believing the audience reviews instead of Rotten Tomatoes. I don't think I'll be using Rotten Tomatoes as a guide in future. The acting, special effects, and storyline were all superb. This is a rip-roaring adventure epic in the grand old tradition of films like Ben-Hur, and is a must-see for any lover of sci-fi or fantasy (it blends the two together quite admirably). It deserves even more than the four-and-a-half stars it's earned on Amazon.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|As a songwriter on the go I find it very useful. It is user friendly and helps to keep things organized. But my favorite features are the notes and voice recorder which in my case allows me to capture melodies and write my lyrics in the same entry.. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|amazing! so fare, this game is awesome. the only thing I would change is that the white boomerang and orange would return. other than that no changes and the game is beast
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just love this book. I can't wait to read more. I don't know what to do when this series is over.
0345803485|2.0|For what it is,an erotic fantasy, the novel gets it's point across but the writing is truly terrible and REPETITIOUS (shouty caps anyone?).  The writing is juvenile and makes reading Twilight feel like a piece of classic literature.  The first half of the book gained my interest but after a few sexual encounters it was evident that there was absolutely no plot.  For every page of banter, unnecessary drama, and foreplay between the two characters, there was what seemed like five pages of explicit sex.  I, like other readers, was becoming increasingly annoyed with the tedious overuse of phrases and words like \\"my inner goddess\\", \\"cocking head to one side\\", \\"oh my\\", etc.  The characters and their situations are very unrealistic which is probably why so many women are dropping their panties (figuratively and literally speaking) fantasizing about Christian.  We all know that this man doesn't exist in real life-domineering yet charming, handsome and muscular, filthy rich, generous philanthropist...and the list goes on. The novel would've fared better if Christian was a creepy sex-crazed killer; that premise is more interesting and more convincing to me since he was very creepy.  Without his good looks and billions, he would just be some creepy joe blow that women can't swoon over. Ana is also very unbelievable. We are supposed to be convinced that a 21 year old virgin with no prior physical contact with a man is having multiple orgasms every time after losing her virginity, doesn't own a decent dress, and has no e-mail account nor computer. This is all very laughable.  My advice is that if you are still curious about this book, turn your brain cells off completely and and let your libido do all the thinking.  This book is only skin deep.
B005KELQEU|4.0|This product fit my Kindle (this one is the new one without a keyboard available for Christmas 2011) perfectly. I bought it because I needed a case to protect the screen when I put the Kindle in my backpack or my purse, and it was the cheapest and most durable option. It does make the Kindle a bit more bulky, but not enough to make me complain about it. I wish it came in more colors, though the black looks very nice. I would have preferred a case that was a flip-cover so that I could leave the case on and read, but this seems to be the best protection out of all the cases currently available, and it's at the best price.
B005LAIGNC|3.0|This is film has amazing special effects and combat scenes .The acting was okay for the most part.Lucas tried to make this film for over 23 years.All the studios didn't want to touch this film because most of the cast were black.They were afraid that film fans weren't going to see it .I take my hat off to Lucas for making this film.He spent money from his own pocket to make this movie.Too bad it wasn't as good as the Tuskegee airmen film.Maybe as time goes by this film will be a cult classic like Blade runner.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love/hate (but still give it a 4 1/2 to 5 star) this series on different levels. I also kind of \\"hid my face like a horror movie between my fingers\\" on others. I loved the basis of it but was kind of scared of the \\"other\\" stuff that was going on. It was erotic and very inviting when it wasn't being brutal. I like the ending and almost wish there was more to go with it.
B0086700CM|5.0|very good game I greatly enjoy it its fun to play for all ages I practically play it 24/7 great game really love it.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is so very addicting.  I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire and it's even more fun.  Try it.  You'll like it.
B000JMLFLW|1.0|Sirs,<br />I returned this free e-book because, as I passed the pages it would return to the begining of the 2nd. or 3d. chapters that I had already read.<br />I downloaded \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" in order to re-read it as we read it in High School, but I was exasperated because the pages kept skipping to the past chapters...<br /><br />Sorry about this.... By the way, thank you for the free e-books, anyway.....
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|The graphics are ok. The game is reasonably polished. It just got old quickly, as in minutes. I found it frustrating that you can't reverse the Guy's gravity once he is airborne. About to uninstall.
0765316994|5.0|A wonderful satire of television science fiction programs (somewhere, Gene Roddenberry's ears are burning) that also packs a surprising emotional punch.  Definitely worth reading.
034552554X|5.0|This was a really enjoyable book. It told a great story. In addition it was fun getting to know about the language of flowers. I would recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was going to start this by saying this was one of the best sci-fi books I've read, but thats not accurate, this is one of the best stories I've read from any genre.  Character development is some of the best I've seen.  Amazing book!
B0072IVGZG|5.0|The Cult's new CD \\"Choice of Weapon\\" is so good it's almost scary.  Rarely does a lyricist and singer have so many important things to say, and rarer still is that artist partnered with a guitarist so skillful in helping to communicate those ideas.  Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy know we've had a really bad time here for a decade or more, and they have some powerful ideas to impart: Don't be deceived by people who would have you live a life of constant warring and conflict, don't be pulled into ugliness and blackness, don't let technology and diversion and evil take over your life, don't let anyone steal your soul.<br /><br />In Honey from a Knife Billy Duffy's guitar twists you into a ferocious whirlwind while Ian addresses the fear and panic one feels when truly lost.  In Elemental Light Ian addresses every soul's search for something beautiful, something meaningful in life.  The respite is fleeting however, as next in The Wolf Astbury cautions listeners \\"Don't be deceived by the liars, caught in the jaws and the flame\\" while Billy plays one of his best riffs in years.  It's not all desolation, however: In Life > Death Ian first warns \\"Kill your jealousy and what you believe\\" before declaring that \\"You can't destroy them, the beauty and the youth; you'll never beat them, you'll never hide the truth.\\"  In For the Animals his disdain for society's current state of darkness is in full display, Astbury fairly spitting the words \\"I came to you with love in my heart.\\"  In Wilderness Now Ian Astbury sings in an almost trancelike state, \\"I can't wake from this dream.  Death walks right beside me, the light shines bright behind me\\" while Billy Duffy masterfully wraps you in a nightmarish dream.  Next in Lucifer Ian and Billy drop you into the merciless hell of addiction and despair: \\"You are my Lucifer, sucking on the crack...\\"  In A Pale Horse Ian reminds you that everyone gets his comeuppance sooner or later, combining the Biblical (\\"Behold a grey horse, death rides a pale horse\\") with the wickedly modern \\"You don't stand a chance, you poor little hipster.\\"  What are you going to choose, the darkness or the light?  Will you be redeemed?  You'd better hope so - in This Night in the City Forever Mr. Astbury offers a final warning from the sort of judge your immortal soul might not like to meet: \\"I don't mess around.  Throw your weapon to the ground.\\"<br /><br />It is astonishingly good stuff, ignited and illuminated by Billy Duffy's signature guitar crunch.  Kudos must be given to the rhythm section too, with drummer John Tempesta and bassist Chris Wyse keeping a solid hard-rocking pace that anchors Billy's guitar work.  Some have complained that Billy doesn't play a lot of soaring leads on this LP.  I say that's alright, the dark rhythmic moods he creates contribute mightily to everything that's happening here, and the few accenting leads Billy drops in are all the more appropriate and appreciated.  Astbury's voice is powerful still, but wracked by age, drink and drug and smoke it is imbued with a humanity that only comes from struggle and hard-won enlightenment.<br /><br />\\"Choice of Weapon\\" comes with a bonus CD, a four song EP of sorts that is really dark - it's the sort of music the devil might listen to while eating his breakfast.  Embers is stunning, with lyrics such as \\"The world that you spit upon has forgotten your name.\\"  Siberia describes what life is like without love, and the other songs are equally worthy of the warning \\"This is a magickal spell, do not open.\\"  The black-clad heyoka on the CD cover is there for a reason.horse\\") with the wickedly modern \\"You don't stand a chance, you poor little hipster.\\"  What are you going to choose, the darkness or the light?

B007Y36K46|5.0|The movie totally reflects the spirit of the book. i enjoyed reading it when I was a kid, and I can say that the movie has absolutely met my expectations.
0060873027|1.0|I purchased this book because I wanted to save some money but still get a hard cover book. The book I recieved is in great condition. BUT IT IS A LIBRARY BOOK! Covered, stamped, name of the library and all. I am completely not ok with this and do not like having it in my possesion. I am an avid book lover and someone selling off library books is about as low as it gets. I wouldnt buy from this seller again!
B0086700CM|5.0|love it...but gotta be quick...hard to put down! This game is addicting and would highly recommend it! Download it right now!
0446572993|1.0|The Audible version really falls flat. The male/ female readers sound like they called in their work from different locations and they were spliced together. And the female voice was especially lifeless and robotic sounding.<br />And the sound effects.....cheesy!!<br />The book itself is nothing like the David Baldacci I remember from years ago. I think he called this one in too.<br />There's something about the 14yo character that is really phony.<br />Skip this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|At first I didn't like this game but the more I played the funner it got. And now? Hah... Now I can't put it down! Kind of repetitive but it does what a good game should: Entertains and hooks you :) Have fun!!!
B002U0KHMY|4.0|I love White Collar, I really, really love the show.  The writing is consistently excellent, the photography is spectacular, and, well -- Matt Bomer.  What's not to like?  However, the DVD sets themselves...<br /><br />I discovered the show a bit late, but I'd already seen all of Season One on Netflix.  I bought the DVD mainly for the extras.  And they're nice enough, but I have to say:  These people deliver the *lamest* audio commentary I've ever heard.  Bomer, DeKay, Jeff Eastin and sometimes Willie Garvin and Tiffani Thiessan contribute to commentary on several episodes, and it's hard to credit how *boring* they are.  It's like they keep getting caught up in the show as they watch, so there are long silences (thanks, guys) and then brilliant comments like, \\"Oh, this part is great.  This was so fun to film.\\"  This does not, I feel, deliver much in the way of insights or extra information.  There's some discussion of the locations, which is nice, and maybe as a New Yorker I'm undervaluing that for people from other places.  Still, I maintain that the commentary tracks on the whole are lame.<br /><br />And frankly, it does not get better on the Season Two DVD or the Season Three DVD.  In fact, each season seems to provide less in the way of extras than the season before.  Certainly the number of episodes with commentary decreases steadily; in Season Three, there is only one.  Obviously, I didn't think they did a great job with the commentary but it was better than nothing at all.  The value in the DVD's for me *is* the extras; I can get the episodes streaming on Netflix for no cost over my family's membership.  Or, they appear on Amazon Instant (for a price, natch) long before the DVD's come out.  Or, you know, one can catch them on TV. :-)<br /><br />If you buy the DVD set for any season, I'd go with Season One.  Unless I hear from a lot of people that Season Four's DVD set is substantially better than the last three, I won't be buying it.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|Just listened to the album and I was really mesmerized. These legendary men can really make you sing along and have a fun time listening to them. I really enjoyed it, even though it was a little too short, about 30 min., it still blew me away. Their voices were superb, Brian sounded better than ever, and even Mike could support the boys in endless harmony. It starts off with a great vocal harmony, Think about the Days, that really blew me away. Then my 3 favorite song in a row, Thats Why God Made the Radio, Isn't it Time and Spring Vacation, they sounded amazing. The Private Life of Bill and Sue was great too, with Brian singing the lead, made it sound really cool. Shelter was good too, with Jeffery singing the chorus along with the boys. To be honest, I did not care for Daybreak Over the Ocean, it just did not bring me good vibrations. But From There to Back Again really give me excitation's. Alans beautiful voice really shone through, and the ending with the whistling was really beautiful. Pacific Coast Highway and Summers Gone, were really beautiful. The whole album sounded great, and I loved every second of it. This album will put a smile on my face through an endless summer that the Beach Boys will provide for me. Thats Why God Made the Radio will put a smile on your face while you are listening to the harmonies and sounds of the Beach Boys.<br /><br />RIP- Carl Wilson and Dennis Wilson.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|This movie is so well done that you do not realize when the real horse is on and when the graphics come in.The story is a very moving one. As soon as we got home I ran to check that the horse was fine.It is a moving story ,and of course animals are so loving, better than humans in many cases.<br />This movie is really a classic.

B005HSL626|5.0|this is a good game for all ages. it is not a boaring game either it keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|Saw 250 five-star reviews, 6 one-star reviews and thought, \\"Hey, this is gonna be a good movie!\\"  I don't know if the 5 stars were planted but if not, I feel the reviewers must not have seen the same movie I saw.  Even the special effects touted by some reviews were severely lacking.  The quality of special effects reminded me of the original Star Wars, but hey, that was 1977.  Characters were silly, dialog was juvenile and corny (wait till you see the salutes), effects were terrible;  it was basically a waste of 2 hours and $3.99.  Save your money.  This was a stupid movie.  Very B movie quality.  Wanted to like it, but couldn't.  Really can't think of one redeeming quality in this film.
0345803485|5.0|This was an amazing story, very well written. i read all 3 in 6 days and am sad its over. it was fantastic, easy to get lost in. Definitely the book of the year.
B007BRJYF2|1.0|nice graphics, however, you can't actually see items. the screen doesn't adjust to make it larger.  also, the timer sucks, if you can't see the objects (they're too tiny) what's the point of the game or the timer.  removed from device.  not worth going blind and timed while doing so.

I have read the problem on a few reviews,  At times I have aproblem in getting the last piece,off the Side,  but I found out if you use the stiles,  it helps. I hope this issue is resolved. Other than that,  I am enjoying this app. which was free!
B00112ASXK|5.0|This fine looking Stallion [this model is of a male] features accurate, rich colors and details (it's even wearing silver Horseshoes on it's hooves!) It has shiny, deep eyes that are as characteristic and wise as you would see on a real horse. This appears to be a very sturdy toy, it's even a little heavy for it's size! It's a decent size, too, not too big and not too small. You can practically hear it snort and whinny.<br /><br />It may look like a pony to some, but in real life Tinkers are the height of saddle horses. They are incredibly strong, yet have an genial disposition.<br /><br />I continue to be impressed with Schleich toys. The Schleich toys never fail in the areas of fine detail, accurate colors, and quality. Very few toys are as finely crafted that can stand up to children's playtime. They are so richly detailed, they appeal to both child and adult collectors alike.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with Schleich.

039472903X|5.0|In the early 1980s, I was in a career transition from product design to marketing. One of the first books I read was Ogilvy on Advertising, published in 1983. David Ogilvy had already published Confessions of an Advertising Man 20-years earlier (1963), which was generally regarded as required reading for anyone in, or considering, the advertising business. On Advertising is, generally, an update of Confessions, with a little less memoir and a lot more illustrations. I consider it the quintessential handbook on advertising.<br /><br />Ogilvy starts with an absolute, fundamental premise:<br /><br />\\"I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information. When I write an advertisement, I don't want you to tell me that you find it `creative.' I want you to find it so interesting that you buy the product.\\"<br /><br />David Ogilvy was, among many accomplishments, an excellent copywriter. He breaks 217 pages into 20 chapters with hundreds of illustrations and crisp, straightforward text that covers subjects including:<br /><br />* How to produce advertising that sells<br />* How to run an advertising agency<br />* 18 miracles of research<br />* What's wrong with advertising<br /><br />Ogilvy clearly differentiates between advertising and marketing, and views himself as an advertising man.  He opens a chapter titled, What little I know about marketing, \\"When they told me I had won the Parlin Award for Marketing, I thought they were kidding. I cannot even understand what the experts write on the subject.\\" He continues, \\"However, thirty odd years of rubbing shoulders with marketing practitioners have taught me some things that have helped in my work,\\" and proceeds to dispense a dozen pearls of wisdom in five pages.<br /><br />The two chapters that have had the greatest influence on me are 1) The secrets of success in business-to-business advertising, and 2) Direct mail, my first love and secret weapon. The guidelines in these two chapters are ones I have used continually for nearly 30 years with great success.<br /><br />In the first chapter of the book, Ogilvy states:<br /><br />\\"When I set up shop on Madison Avenue in 1949, I assumed that advertising would undergo several major changes before I retired. So far, there has been only one change that can be called major: television has emerged as the most potent medium for selling most products.\\"<br /><br />Over the past 15 years, the Internet has emerged as the most potent medium for advertising and marketing, in large part because it enables an interactive exchange of information and very precise monitoring and measurement of buyer behavior. Ultimately, the Internet, like television, is a communications channel. And the guidelines Ogilvy prescribes to create and conduct a successful B2B advertising and direct mail campaign half a century ago are just as relevant to creating and executing an effective B2B digital marketing program today.are ones I have used continually for nearly 30 years with great success.<br /><br />In the first chapter of the book, Ogilvy states:<br /><br />\\"When I set up shop on Madison Avenue in 1949, I assumed that advertising would undergo several major changes before I retired.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I purchased this app for my 6 yr old Granddaughter who enjoys Mario Bros. She is just as excited about the levels and play of this game. I have to say that Lep World is challenging for me!! I am not much of a \\"Gamer\\", but I think it is fun, and keeps us both entertained during long trips or boring waits, or just whenever we feel like playing. We have not had any problems with the game freezing, or slowing other functions. All around a worthwhile purchase!!
B0086700CM|5.0|great app I was using in iphone nice to see here in kindle the User interface is good and really nice to play
B0086700CM|5.0|the game is cool I really like it.You should get it.<br />the game is great.Get it.<br />It's awsome.I am awsome

B007ZRZF8I|2.0|Sorry but its not like this game took a year to develope and cost 100 million dollars. If you feel like its worth more than .99 then charge more with the initial fee and unlock all the games content.
0545265355|5.0|Great product. Arrived on time and everything is perfect! THANKS<br />The Boxed Set is really nice, new and very colorful.<br /><br />I will start reading it right now!!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This album has to be the best album the Foos have released since There is Nothing Left to lose. After listening to it for over a year, I still do not think there is a bad song on here. My favorite tracks are White Limo, Back and Forth and Walk.
B0086700CM|1.0|While the graphics are not perfect, gameplay wins. While it is not easy to play in crowded areas, it does not matter. This game makes you play for upgrade. IT IS AMAZING.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|It's a fun time killer, makes you exercise your brain muscle...Well, maybe not a full workout. If you like memory games you'll enjoy this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very great game. Good for passing time. Seems to have a good goal. Love leveling up. Looking for more from the makers. The coolest game I have played before. Definitely worth downloading tbis game.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I dont know a lot of other people who have seen this series, but Iam not a prime time fan of ABC dramas, and I hopelessly fell in love with this show! The characters are complex, the sets and the wardrobe are exquisite, I couldn't wait each week to see how they were going to dress the evil queen. The princesses are quite beautiful, the men are handsome, and the evil Rumplestiltskin is charmingly seductive...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very intertaining and easy to play. great if you love the movie. I reccommend for all ages. reading is part of the game so be able to read. love it so enjoy!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love this game so it is very good to have it on my Kindle so I can take in car trips without having to be worried about loosing a card.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and it has bunch of puzzle that everybody can enjoy playing when there is nothing to do. I highly recomend getting this appppppp. I didn't expect this much fun from a freeeeeeee appppppppp....
0545265355|5.0|I was very happy with this purchase. The shipment went way faster than the estimated arrival date said. I was also impressed by the perfect condition of the books in the package. Plus, I have loved reading these books! I would recommend them to anyone who likes fast paced fictional stories! Great find on amazon!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series was by far one of the best set of books I have read in the last 2 years. I finished the series in about 10 days. I know not that fast right? Well I slowed down because I did not want it to end. This series had everything and more that I like in a book. Romance, erotica, plus suspense, thriller and funny. I laughed, cried and was even stirred, ;). You will not go wrong by buying this series. I hope she does another along the lines of this one. Make sure you read the samples and other comments. This is not a normal romance/erotica book. It does have somewhat of a dark side, but only touches on that to make the main character more real. I plan on finding her webpage, so I can see when her next series is out. Enjoy!!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Elizabeth Haynes' novel, \\"Into the Darkest Corner\\", is a tense, scary and mesmerizing description of how emotional and physical abuse can drastically change the lives of victims. Although the book may be fiction, true-life  accounts of woman who have experienced abuse bear witness to its core validity.<br /><br />Free-spirited Cathy loves hanging with her friends, dancing, drinking too much, and avoiding commitment. Then she meets Lee, who is apparently every woman's dream mate. The more involved the couple becomes, the more Cathy realizes Lee is really her worst nightmare. Too much detail in a review would lessen the book's impact.<br /><br />The novel moves from past to present and back again, effectively demonstrating how Cathy's life changes after she meets Lee, illustrating how she gradually becomes aware of the destructiveness of the man and their relationship, skillfully depicting how her abuser insinuates himself into her existence, isolates her, and serves as the impetus for the withdrawn, frightened woman she becomes.<br /><br />Switching between past and present heightens the tension, keeps the reader off-balance along with the heroine, and makes \\"Into the Darkest Corner\\" a terrifying, can't-put-down read.<br /><br />Five stars.
0345803485|1.0|If you have ever been in a abusive or controlling relationship and are stil suffering from it I would not at all recommend this book. I had no clue it was going to go like that. No I did not finish but I couldn't after it started bringing back memories of that control.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is so great.  love the reading plans, the versions you can read in. the Bible is always in reach. especialally love reading from my kindle fire. I have never had an issue.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish I had read the other reviews before buying!!!  Do not waste your money. One long sex scene with no plot.  I would have rather watched a porn video, would have been more amusing (maybe it would have a plot too).  This is very juvenile and extremely repetitive.  In the second half of the book, I found myself skimming through pages and pages to get to something interesting or plot-related (which didn't happen). I like a good sex scene as much as the next person.  But when 75% of the book is sex it gets a little boring. I got soooooo sick of hearing about her stupid \\"inner goddess\\" and her \\"subconscious\\"!! Who thinks like that?!? No one! Again do not waste your money or time. (By the way this is the first book review I have ever submitted. It is that bad that I feel compelled to warn others.)
B004JN1CW4|5.0|VERY GOOD. it left a lot hanging but tied up the rest nicely. a lot of questions were left unanswered but you can make your answers and that will tie it up for you. i believe that this book is just as good as the others and would recommend it to fans of the first two books
B005LAIH3G|4.0|This movie was well worth purchasing. Great story and special effects. I was very interested in the characters and I thought the acting was exceptional. I will probably watch it several times.

B007O4XX9K|3.0|When I saw that Jeff Lynne was produciing this album, I knew trouble was not far behind.  Jeff Lynne adores simple, plodding one dimensional rock, and just as he screwed up the Traveling Wilburys and some of Tom Petty's mid-career stuff (although Full Moon Fever is a fantastic album, and was well received despite it's Jeff Lynne signature plod, the technique was new and novel then).  Jeff has fouled artists from Bob Dylan to George Harrison with his dinosaur metronome style.<br /><br />Well, Jeff Lynne has now snagged our favorite son, Joe Walsh.  Plodding.  Repetitive.  Dreadful.  Jeff Lynne.<br /><br />As another reviewer below states, only at the end, with Funk 50 and India, do we get a reprive from Jeff's handcuffs.  Those tracks sound like the untamed Joe Walsh, funky wildman that we adore.<br /><br />The rest of the album, unfortunately, will not be one that Walsh fans will be pulling out to listen to a year or two from now.<br /><br />Joe, you need a ballsy, rip-snorting producer more befitting your style and skills.  Bob Rock (Metallica), Bruce Fairbain or Rick Rubin (Aerosmith), Butch Vig (Garbage, Nirvana, Foo Fighters), Daniel Lanois (U2)... anyone else.  Anyone!  Did they all hang up on our man Joe?<br /><br />Jeff Lynne, please reform ELO and leave our rock idols alone. Turn your own albums to stone (just like you did with ELO starting with Discovery and everything since).  Thanks.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game .  Great for all ages.  Is is fun making families &amp; building your village.  L had trouble visiting friends villages.  Hope they fix it soon.)
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I am compelled to review this album. I just listened to it for the first time last night, and enjoyed the entire album - so much that I'm listening to it again today as I'm working.  Even though I'm tired today, and a bit overwhelmed with work, I feel the tunes to be lively and interesting enough to help improve my mood and attention. I am also interested in listening to the lyrics but they aren't so distracting that I can't just enjoy the music and overall vibe. This is really expected from Norah - these pop worthy upbeat songs. In fact, if I hadn't known it was Norah's album I would have thought it was another artist. Kudos!

144234430X|4.0|11/22/63 proves that King can still tell a good story, if not one without flaws. The concept, in which a man is shown a doorway that can take him back to 1958, granting him the chance to prevent JFK's assassination and several other tragedies, may seem a bit outside King's usual territory, but he's been experimenting with alternate realities and science fiction-y ideas for a while, so it's not that much of a stretch.<br /><br />The initial setup feels a little arbitrary, but once the protagonist, Jake Epping, actually goes back to 1958 and begins mucking with a past that \\"doesn't want to be changed\\", the reader has a delicious sense of all the places the story COULD go, and King doesn't neglect to string us along, throwing in twists and turns both big and small. The time travel aspects of the plot are well thought-out, and the parts dealing with Lee Harvey Oswald feel impeccably researched, down to the tiniest detail. Though I've never paid much attention to all the conspiracy theories, King's take on the events leading up to the assassination kept me guessing. And one of his strengths as a writer has always been capturing the texture and personality of small town, blue collar America, and he brings the sights, sounds, smells, conversation, and attitudes of the \\"Mad Men\\" era right back to life. I enjoyed the trip to a more innocent (though not really) time quite a lot.<br /><br />On the down side, while I found the main JFK plot and its aftermath pretty riveting, this portion of the book could have easily fit into a novella, and doesn't have a lot of interaction with the various side plots. The somewhat redundant Harry Dunning story was less interesting to me, and Jake Epping's romance with the town of Jodie, Texas and a woman named Sadie Dunhill, while not without touching moments, felt more than a little contrived in places. The protagonist could have been a little better defined, as well -- he's basically just an everyman with a sketched-in backstory (and was notconvincing as someone born in the mid-70s). When all was said and done, I came away feeling that it had been a enjoyable ride, but not one I'd gotten anything too surprising or profound from.<br /><br />Then again, it's Stephen King, and that's about what you expect from his books. 11/22/63 shows he's still a master of popular fiction, and can do the suspense, sentimentality, and Americana that got him an audience in the first place. I can see the novel doing well as a movie, in the hands of a talented director and actors.<br /><br />3.5 stars.<br /><br />Audiobook notes: the reader sounds a little old to be a guy in his 30s/40s (as the protagonist is), but injects a lot of personality into the side characters.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|People get to choose, fact is, everyone gets to choose. Now some folk is too serious, they think they is higher than all the world.

0061692042|2.0|Richard Ford is one of our great American Novelists. His new work Canada, demonstrates that even the best ones can write a bad novel. The other critical reviews said it all. Unbelievably repetitive, not much of a plot and no redemption in the end. I, like others, kept reading, hoping right to the end of Canada that Ford would redeem himself if not his characters. Not this time. I gave it two stars just because he's Richard Ford. I hope he is busy at work writing another book.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Cinder is a cyborg who belongs to her selfish stepmother. Her two stepsisters are not evil, but they are more favored. And instead of singing mice or a fairy godmother, she has a house robot who encourages her to solve her own problems.<br /><br />Cinder is living in troubled times. A plague is sweeping the country. The Emperor is threatened and the Crown Prince is only barely of age. She herself is subhuman because of her cyborg body parts.<br /><br />When the story spins up Cinder is looking forward to the ball in the middle of a diplomatic invasion and the Crown Prince's ascension. But of course, she can't go without her foot...<br /><br />Read this book for an interesting Cinderella story and an even more interesting worldbuilding about what it means to be human, in a world where so many of us are becoming a little bit cyborg.<br /><br />At Wiscon, someone told me that this book started life as a Sailor Moon fanfic. I don't know if that's true, but it makes SO MUCH SENSE if so. You don't need to know anything about Sailor Moon to read the story, though.<br /><br />Read if: You're looking for a new spin on the Cinderella story. You'd enjoy light philosophical noodling about the humanity of androids.<br /><br />Skip if: You want a resolved story. This one is going places, and there is not a tidy finish to this book.
B001H1SW4M|4.0|Up to this point, I had avoided watching any of the Saw movies. I'm a definite fan of horror movies, but a gore fest is not my idea of entertainment. I just ignored the hype over the whole series because of the basic premise, until now. The plot is nothing special, nor is the acting, but I have to say I enjoyed it. It wasn't overly bloody like I figured it would be and there was enough plot twists and suspense that kept me captivated. I wouldn't recommend it to the squeamish, but for all the horror fans out there, its worth the money to rent.

B007PVHBHC|5.0|Patti Smith hasn't released a proper new album since 2004's TRAMPIN'.  Her latest release, BANGA finds Smith back in the studio feeling just as comfortable as ever before.  The outcome is an album that is both soulful, beautiful, organic, and confident.  At the album's best, its a great punk-tinged pop-poetry showcase.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Amerigo\\" is a great, half spoken-word piece about the wonders and excitement of new discovery; similar techniques are used to great effect on \\"Tarkovsy (the Second Stop is Jupiter)\\" as well.  These songs (and the 10-minute \\"Constantine's Dream\\") fuses Smith's pop-sensibilities with her street-poet instincts.  Other tracks on the album are a little more forward in convention, though that's not necessarily a bad thing.  \\"This is the Girl\\" is a poignant and sweet remembrance of the troubled Amy Winehouse; \\"Nine\\" rolls through guitar riffs and percussive tribal-like rhythms.  Smith's lyrics are just as good as ever, but some of the energy she had feels lost.  The track \\"Banga\\" has all the right elements: nice guitar riffs, interesting lyrics, good melodies, but it lacks the energy that her earlier work showcased.  This energy has been replaced by a warm, wise, soulful mood that pervades the album.  BANGA ends with \\"After the Gold Rush,\\" a great ballad that brings in her children to finish the song for her.<br /><br />Long time fans of Patti Smith will love BANGA.  For new listeners, this album is a good entrance to her catalog, but I would suggest starting with her seminal HORSES.  Listeners of Tom Waits and Bruce Springsteen will find a lot to like here.  Outstanding tracks to sample: \\"Amerigo,\\" \\"Banga,\\" and \\"Constantine's Dream.\\"  These songs will give you a good idea what to expect from the album.  BANGA is fantastic -- give it a listen whether or not you've listened to Smith before or not.<br /><br />The deluxe edition of BANGA includes a hardback book that contains photos, lyrics, and liner notes.  The liner notes provide a great commentary track for the album and is recommended for long-time fans.e a great commentary track for the album and is recommended for long-time fans.

B007ZRZF8I|4.0|I enjoyed it, it's a poor mans jetpack joyride with some clever levels.  Two things, it is tough, so expect a hard time.  I actually like that about a  game though.  Two, once you use your slow motions (which really help make the game easier), you have to pay money to buy more.  This is the game's weakest point.  I saved my slow motions and beat the game with only using two and enjoyed it, but I can see why some reviewers are annoyed.  Had miniclip just given you a way to earn more without purchasing them, the game would have been much more fun.  Me, I had a good time with it anyway, but I'm cheap and never purchase in app items.

0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins, author of the Hunger Games, grew up with a dad in the military and knew all about the aspects of war. This leads many to believe that this is why she based the Hunger Games around war, fighting, and violence. The Hunger Games is a novel about a future America that is split into multiple districts, which are all strictly controlled by the Capital. The Capital enjoys showing their dominance over these several districts by hosting a competition that is called the Hunger Games; these games are watched throughout the entire nation and 1 boy and 1 girl between the ages of 12 - 18 are chosen from each district. Katniss Everdeen takes the place of her sister and volunteers as tribute, she is going up against 23 other competitors- one of them she ends up falling in love with (Peeta Mellark). This book is an adventurous, suspenseful novel that also plays as a romance between two tributes from the same district fighting for survival in these dangerous games. Only one tribute is allowed to win; yet both Peeta and Katniss want to come about victorious together- so they story continues as a survival of the fittest and test of strength and determination. Suzanne Collins wrote this novel to show the negatives about society and to reflect a subject that she knows all to well- war.<br /><br /> Suzanne Collins's purpose in writing the Hunger Games is that she wanted to portray our society, and the violence that we live in; although much more exaggerated, she still wanted to get a point across that our society is selfish, violent and we are constantly controlled by a higher power. Suzanne also wanted to make sure her audience knew that one person can be influential and serve as a symbol of much significance; such as Katniss serving as a representation of hope and determination for the underprivileged districts. It is important to remember that the author grew up in a military family, so she recalls all the information of war and fighting- making it very simple for herto reveal these memories of violence in her book.<br /><br /> Throughout the novel, Suzanne Collins makes sure to emphasize her main purposes in writing this novel by exaggerating her points and characters. She wants to display how our society is selfish and vicious, Collins does this by showing the distinct split between extreme poverty and the life of luxury. The Capital could care less about the poor, deprived districts as long as they are living a wealthy, simple lifestyle. Collins also states a claim that us as individuals are constantly controlled by a higher power, such as the government. She supports this by showing how the Capital is constantly watching and keeping the districts under control and making sure they will not rebel, such as forcing the districts to give up their own kids- in doing this it reinforces the capitals overall dominance and superiority over the commoners. Collins also emphasizes the idea of symbolism and how one person can make a difference; Katiniss and Peeta end up diminishing the power of the capital and represent love, determination, and wit.<br /><br /> The book argues that society is greedy and everyone seeks violence and dominance over others. The argument Collins makes is quite convincing because it portrays the capital and the districts as complete opposites and really contrasts the 2 extremes of poverty and wealth, the games also represent this selfishness because everyone is fighting and willing to kill each other instead of fighting against the capital. The novel also argues that one person can make a difference and this is reinforced through her powerful characters, such as Katniss a self- determined, faithful girl who defeats the dominance of the Hunger games and Peeta who is a weaker individual yet loving and loyal- showing that you don't have to be the strongest to conquer over the higher power.<br /><br /> The Hunger Games is not just a typical war book about rebellion and fighting for your beliefs, it has its own style and involves romance, action, teenagers, and parents who must give up their children; which is why it relates to adults, younger kids, people who enjoy a thrill, and the more romantic individuals. This book is written in a way that will keep you interested throughout the whole novel, unlike other war books where it is slow in the beginning and only catches your attention during the fighting scenes. It is also not as mythical and unrealistic as other violent, romance novels such as the Percy Jackson series and Twilight.<br /><br /> Overall this book is a well-written novel that would appeal to a range of ages from 10- adults. Some parts of the book may be confusing and not as impacting as it should be to some younger readers. This book allows you to connect and even relate to the characters, making you experience a deeper level of interaction with the novel. In certain instances you can even feel the characters' pain and the suspense from the games. The Hunger Games is an amazing novel that everyone can relate to in some way, it allows you to let your imagination venture off and feel as if you are involved in the competition yourself. I highly recommend readers to begin this series, and you will not be disappointed.

B0036EH3TS|3.0|Facts that can be learned from watching Armageddon:<br /><br />* Fire doesn't burn in a vacuum; it rages.<br />* Mir is capable of generating artificial gravity.<br />* It can be daylight in the U.S. and the Middle East at the same time.<br />* Space vehicles come equipped with machine guns.<br />* A stellar object 1/50 the size of the Earth can generate similar gravity (except when somebody  jumps).<br />* A single nuclear weapon is capable of splitting a piece of rock 500 miles in diameter.<br /><br />Anybody who complained about inaccurate science in Deep Impact should best stay away. The science in this movie is nothing less than laughably absurd. However, while the science may be more accurate in Deep Impact, this is the more enjoyable movie. That's because it's a lot more fun to see meteors crash into buildings than it is to see Elijah Wood trying to emote.<br /><br />The plot has Ben Affleck fall in love with Liv Tyler whose father, Bruce Willis, has a major problem with their romance for some reason. They are also oil drillers. This is important because an asteroid the size of Texas is heading for earth and only Willis can stop it. By drilling a hole 800 ft. deep and dropping in a single nuke. This will split the asteroid down the middle, allowing both halves to miss the earth while vaporizing all the smaller chunks of asteroid which have been striking the earth's major cities, thereby preventing the destruction of the earth and any more major cities. Oh yes, Bruce Willis also gets a very sad and noble death sequence. (Who else but Jerry Bruckheimer would come up with the idea of a testosterone tear-jerker.)<br /><br />It goes without saying that this is a very silly movie. But it's much more of a manly movie. It celebrates manliness and the love of macho activities like getting into drunken brawls at strip clubs. You will see more acts of testosterone driven sexual insecurity than if you dropped my high school football team into the middle of a gay pride parade. Sample dialogue \\"This b**** needs drilling.\\" (The 'b****' is the asteroid. Just in case you had other ideas). Almost everyone in this movie is male. Liv Tyler doesn't have much purpose except cry, look emotional, and as an unsuccessful attempt to make this movie about anything other than manly-men trying to prove their d**ks are bigger than the asteroid.<br /><br />This movie is pretty bad but it's also a lot of fun if you're in the mood for this kind of thing

B000VDDWE2|3.0|Hey guess what, people? It is now okay to make fun of the Bush administration. For some strange reason, right after 9/11 the mainstream media got it into their heads that if they continue to bash Bush the way they did before 9/11, that the general populace would claw their eyes out or something. But with Day After Tomorrow's (henceforth Tomorrow) skewering of Dubya and Cheney, Hollywood has deemed it acceptable to mock the current administration.<br /><br />Not only that, there are several reasons to be happy about Roland Emmerich's latest flick. First off, it's better than both Godzilla and the Patriot.<br /><br />Finally, here's a summer blockbuster that is directed by a man who knows how to use special effects. The visual effects here are the best I have see in a long time. I really believed that the characters were in those CGI enhanced situations.<br />Although the trailer made it look like pure silliness, Tomorrow did a surprisingly good job of making the scenario look somewhat plausible. At least until after I left the theater and had more time to think about it. Even the two guys running away from ice chasing them played out a lot better than it looked like from the footage I had seen on T.V. It is this plausibility and a true feeling of genuine curiosity about how the world would react to such an event that puts the movie above crap like The Core and Waterworld. We don't see a total collapse of government. In fact it is quite obvious that Emmerich believes that society would be able to adapt to a new ice age in the long run. For the most part the movie is optimistic.<br /><br />This movie could be the big break for Jake Gyllenhaal. He certainly has the talent. Although, this is not what one would call an actor's movie. The script is too shallow and there really isn't anything noteworthy about the characters, although the actors do an effective enough job at gaining our sympathy so that those white knuckle action scenes are actually exciting.<br /><br />On one final note, it is interesting that this is the first movie in a long time to be directed by Roland Emmerich that has nothing to do with Dean Devlin. I'm really interested to know what's up with that. Did they have a falling out or something?

0743454537|1.0|(Spoiler alert. This review discusses certain plot twists and the ending in detail)<br /><br />I decided to read this novel because I was fascinated by the concept. On the book, like most books, are a collection of critical praise. I was prepared for an emotional drama about a family dealing with impossible choices and I felt that the ethical dilemma would be both timely and engrossing. It took me about two weeks to read this book and after reading it I believe that it should be required reading for any aspiring author who wishes to write a story that deals with loss and sickness and how both effect family dynamics. It makes a great example of how NOT to handle such issues. This book is maudlin and manipulative. It's filled with obvious metaphors, idiotic plot twists, and concludes with one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a story (more on that later).<br /><br />The different chapters are named after days of the week; each one features a quote from sources as diverse as Shakespeare to Paradise Lost that neatly sum up the novel's theme. This is one of the most overused and obnoxious gimmicks that authors can use. The novel divides itself into various first person perspectives, and to the author's credit each one does sound like a different person. We get the first person perspectives of the Fitzgerald family and the lawyer that Anna has hired to argue her case, Campbell Alexander (like Campbell Scott he has a first name for a last name and a last name for a first name). During the trial the judge appoints a social worker named Julia as a guardian ad litem to evaluate Anna's ability to make her own decisions and we see her outsider perspective of the family. Notably absent is Kate's perspective.<br /><br />The reason that we don't see Kate's perspective is because author Jody Picoult wants to surprise us with the revelation of Anna's real motive in seeking medical emancipation. This has the effect of rendering Kate more as a symbol and less as a real flesh andblood person. The revelation of Anna's real motive is also problematic. We spend most of the novel not really getting a feel for what drives Anna to take the extraordinary actions of going to a lawyer. Anna's first person perspective feels discordant because she doesn't have a strong internal monologue of her motivations. We know that she is holding something back. The surprise that occurs 3/4 way into the book is that Kate had asked Anna to seek a legal intervention to prevent her from donating her kidney because Kate feels guilty about all that Anna has had to go through and also because Kate wants to die. This surprise is not worth the frustration that the reader feels along with the rest of Anna's family, of not knowing what really drives Anna. It also has the effect of, in large part, rendering moot the ethical dilemma that is central to the novel. It would've been far better to have Anna make the decision to seek medical emancipation with the aid of a lawyer because, although she loves her sister, she does not feel that it is right that she should be forced to donate her kidney. It is overall a major miscalculation on the part of the author.<br /><br />I'm sure all the facts about genetic engineering, cancer, and the legal system have been well researched. But that doesn't matter with the sheer triteness of many of the subplots. Jesse, the teenage son of a firefighter, is so disconnected that he's begun committing arson in abandoned buildings. Campbell Alexander and Julia used to be passionately in love until he broke off their relationship for some unknown reason that isn't revealed until near the novel's end (this is another of the books idiotic plot twists). Kate becomes romantically attached to a teenage boy who has cancer and ends up dying.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the most interesting character is Sarah Fitzgerald, Kate's mother. She is dedicated to her daughter's survival to the point where she comes perilously close to neglecting her other two children. She has spent the last decade doing whatever it took to keep Kate alive. She loves all of her children though and remains a sympathetic, three dimensional character throughout.<br /><br />At this point, the novel is not terrible just mediocre. Then, there is the ending. After it is revealed that Kate had asked Anna to get out of donating her kidney Sarah and the rest of her family finally began to come to grips with the fact that Kate is not going to survive. At this point the logical conclusion would be to have Kate succumb to her cancer and the rest of her family deal with the aftermath in all its messy complications. Instead what happens is that Campbell and Anna get into a car accident, Campbell is fine but Anna ends up brain dead, they take Anna's kidneys and give them to Kate, Kate makes a miraculous recovery, their family heals itself, Jesse gives up his criminal activities and becomes a police officer, Campbell and Julia get married, and everything ends up getting wrapped up in a neat little bow of bittersweet sentimentalism. I'm serious. This ending that I have just described all happens in the last six or seven pages. It comes so completely out of left field and is so stupid and artificial that I had to reread it several times just to make sure I had not imagined it. First of all, the novel had clearly established that even with Anna donating one of her kidneys it was unlikely that Kate was going to survive long-term. The epilogue takes place eight years after the events with Kate describing how she has stayed healthy because the spirit of Anna is with her or some such nonsense. If the author wanted to make a point about how cruel fate and tragedy can strike in an instant and completely change how you thought something was going to be; a better ending would have been to have Anna and Kate die. It still wouldn't have been a good ending, but it would've been better than what we got. As it stands the ending is shamelessly manipulative, implausible, and outright insulting.
0307950689|3.0|I have read all Dan Brown novels, and I must shamefully admit that I had been waiting impatiently for The Lost Symbol. I was excited that he was going to tackle the Free Mason angle, and was so looking forward to see his new creation that I was trying to get glimpses and clues on the Internet before publication, something I usually do not do. Dan Brown builds usually on very original ideas, and can convince you of the reality of the facts he uses. You turn pages and feel informed while entertained.<br />Not this time. The story is bland, barely believable and the characters very shallow and repetitive. I had difficulty in reading it to the end, but when I did, I was even more disapointed by it: Barely believable and asinine.<br />Sorry Mr. Brown. Hope this was a one time fluke.

B001PB3RU8|4.0|UK indie singer Florence Welch along with her band, The Machine (a named borrowed from her former collaborator Isabella \\"Machine\\" Summers), has created a truly awe-inspiring debut album.  Her voice rings something similiar to Kate Nash or A Fine Frenzy, but with more angst.  Her often howling groan reaches inside and pulls up visceral feeling.  This is probably the most evident in the song \\"Howl\\" where an inner beast is released to attack a lover and the chilling refrain \\"be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers\\" reverberates in your head.  The first single \\"Kiss With A Fist\\" is an ode to violent relationships everywhere.  The playful bass and electric guitar riffs compliment the sado-masochistic lyrics as Florence revels in the blissful torture of an unresolved romantic struggle.  While Florence's emotional depth into each song varies from the playfully bloody as in \\"Kiss With A Fist\\" to the intensely eerie blossoming of new love in \\"Drumming Song,\\" the strength of her voice and the dark turn of each song is unmistakable.  Reaching etheral heights in such songs as \\"Cosmic Love\\" Florence's pain stricken heart still resounds with belted lyrics such as \\"the stars, the moon, they have all been blown out, you left me in the dark.\\"  Not quite as dark or broody as Fiona Apple's When The Pawn, but definitely as poetic.  The album closes with a cover of Candi Staton's \\"You've Got The Love,\\" which is sung with sincerity and longing but still cannot hold a candle to Staton's original version, nor the pulse threading One Source remix of the classic song.  However, Florence's over all feeling and sound is something akin to the inexplicable mystical appeal of Stevie Nicks, without being as coarse as Stevie's drug ridden chords.
B00499K9E0|5.0|This \\"modern\\" remake of Sherlock is by far the best and most enternaining I have ever seen! Wish there were more than five stars to score it. The wit, humor and style is so refreshing. All the actors are superb- and Benedict and Martin are a perfect match! I have watched it on TV and now am enjoying it for the limited time on the internet. I have never done this before but I intend to purchase the entire series (via computer or dvd) as it becomes available. BRAVO to all for such fine work. I do hope you give us many more series to enjoy!
B004K4AVAG|2.0|The newest album by Lady Gaga is both artistic and historic.  With her sophomore effort, Gaga sounds more like she travelled back in time rather than moved forward.  Gaga has established a reputation for pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable in both fashion and music, and although a melodious throw back, she retains this reputation with Born This Way.  The title track from the album has quickly become an anthem for every \\"freak\\" out there and clearly states the Lady's individuality and understanding of all the various walks of life experienced in the human species.  As a whole the album is decent, but it definitely takes some warming up to.  While the track \\"Born This Way\\" is instantly likeable, there are only a few other tracks that can make the same claim.  Other instantly listenable tracks are \\"Marry The Night\\" and \\"You & I.\\"  The rest of the album tends to get lost in sound and mixed or juvenile metaphor as in the song \\"Hair,\\" which leaves the listener thinking, \\"How awful must the rejected tracks have been from this album, if such a poorly written lyric made it's way into the mix?\\"  Although from the public persona that Gaga portrays, it seems unlikely that many people tell her, \\"No, that's a bit too silly.\\"  While the general idea of the song touches on something truly American, being free, it is expressed in the equivocal manner of a pre-teen poem.  Similarly, the track \\"Bad Kids\\" expresses a pre-teen hatred of parental control, which I can only imagine will breed some ill-mannered disrespectful juvenile delinquents, but at the very least the song is melodic enough to get your attention.  This being said, I did find the two foreign language songs quite nice.  Although, I can be a bit biased when it comes to this as I am a fan of hearing foreign languages sung or spoken.  \\"Americano\\" is both lyrically interesting and musically intriguing.  Gaga laces the latin vibe of guitars and \\"la la\\" chants with thick electronica.  The lyric also expresses a socially responsible message of worry for Gaga's generation, acceptance of other cultures, and the angst of loving someone if only for a little while.  Perhaps my favorite song on the album is \\"Sheibe.\\"  While the exact translation of the German currently alludes me, the gist is the recognition of your own flaws and the desire to be blind them and those of others.  The song is cool, elegant, dark, and a bit strange just as you would expect from anyone who calls themselves Gaga.

B007MDQW3W|2.0|Spektor's latest Album What We Saw From The Cheap Seats, lives up to its name.  Throughout the album I felt as though I was watching a great artist from so far away that you can't really make out any greatness.  Spektor and her producers have stated that each song on the album can stand alone \\"sonically.\\"  Well, that seems to be the truth, the album does not have any cohesive composition.  When entering the studio Spektor came in with many songs from her journals and seemingly threw together a release on a whim.  The art is devoid from this artist's album, which is ironic considering the first single \\"All The Rowboats\\" conveys the plight of famous works of art held captive in museums.  While I initally thought this was struggling to be a metaphor for humanity, the lyrics do not lend themselves to that interpretation, instead Regina just sings about paintings and statues...as if she is engaging in an act of fancy singing about pictures from Better Homes and Garden magazine.  Personification should be used to make a statement not simply for the use of personification, unless of course you are only looking to sell albums or make people dance.  At times this devout Spektor fan had to entertain the two most devastating words to a true artisit....\\"sell out.\\"  The best song from the album is an updated version of \\"Ne Me Quitte Pas\\" which Spektor previously released on \\"Songs\\" her second self released album.  The few songs on the album that attempt something pertinent to the human condition, such as \\"Small Town Moon\\" and \\"Firewood\\" are lost in the din of useless lyrics.

B002T45VX6|4.0|The new album from Shakira offers international flavor and dance ready beats that will have every gringo wishing they could understand what she was saying.  Shakira's unique gargle singing style is not only oddly appealing but also makes it necessary to look up the lyrics for each of her songs (especially in English), however, as usual, the megastar manages to make the hook prominent, unciated, and crisp so that after one listen you hum the melody for the rest of the day.  Perhaps Shakria's best characteristic is that lyrically she is pure and simplistic.  Each of her songs express emotions and thoughts that are at once profound and yet simplisiticly presented so that at first listen it is easy to gloss over the meaning.  For example, in \\"Did it Again\\" her second single from this album, Shakira sings about promiscuity and her inablity to find love.  Despite it's dark lyrical undertones, the song's beat only makes you want to shimmy your ta-tas.  Utilizing her diverse musical background Shakira uses synthesizers, drums, andean instruments, her nasal cavity to mimic a trumpet, and the occasional gong to provide a delicious musical experience.  Shakira's sound does transition from her usual latin-pop to a more electronic dance sound, that I feel would have been a perfect summer soundtrack (actually, it would have been released at the end of summer, had it not been for the added recording of \\"Give It Up To Me\\" featuring Lil Wayne, which delayed the album's release due to licensing).  But, it also serves as an excellent club album that I'm sure will receive much time being spun by Djs all over the world, no matter the season.  The most dance-worthy track has to be \\"Why Wait\\" that sizzles from beginning to end leaving no alternative except to shake your hips.  Shakira actually collaborated with Indian superstar Hossam Ramzy to provide a middle eastern feel.  Adding to her international superstar status Shakira adds three Spanish versions of her songs \\"Loba (She Wolf), LoHecho Esta Hecho (Did It Again), and Anos Luz (Why Wait).\\"  Each song provides a nice translation of the same emotion with slightly different lyrics....for example Anos Luz means Light Year rather than Why Wait, but the gist of the song is the same.  Perhaps the most sincere song is \\"Gypsy,\\" a love song to a possible lover commenting on Shakira's vagabond existence.  \\"I'm a gypsy, are you coming with me?\\"  As usual Shakira is odd, lovely, artistic and bares no resemblance to anything else out there.  I mean what other singer could howl like a wolf in a song and still make it to the top of the charts in nearly every market on the planet?

B002QGUFWE|4.0|4 grotesque and stylish stars<br /><br />Lady Gaga's sophomore album The Fame Monster is actually the prequel to The Fame.  All the tracks released on The Fame Monster were written by Gaga prior to recording her best selling debut album.  The fact that this 8 track album marks Gaga's writing before she became a star only demonstrates her long standing raw talent.  Staying true to her eccentric style and dance beat, Lady Gaga cranks it up and out with sonorous and lyrically delightful songs that solidify her status as a new pop icon.  Gaga's sartorial image is not the only thing memorable about this artist.  Each song contains catchy lyrics that will quickly make their way into the vernacular of every teen in America.  For example, her lead single \\"Bad Romance\\" contains such lyrics as \\"I want your ugly, I want your disease\\" which is both grotesque and stylish, as is Gaga herself.  Perhaps the most memorable lyric is found in the raunchy \\"Teeth,\\" in which Gaga demands, \\"take a bite of my bad girl meat.\\"  Not only does Gaga produce lyrics that catch your ear and your attention, but she also collaborates with such hit making powerhouses as Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, and the incomparable Beyonce.  Beyonce guests stars on the single \\"Telephone,\\" a dance track commenting on female dominance in relationships and the annoyance of a boyfriend cramping the Lady's partying, \\"stop calling I don't want to talk anymore, I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor.\\"  While Gaga has definitely established herself as the new queen of the dancefloor, she also slows it down in the affectionate and heart broken track \\"Speechless.\\"  This song sounds something similar to a hair band ballad with Gaga nearly shouting the lyrics, an accentuating guitar rift, a non stop pounding drum line, and the inevitable slow down into a quiet piano.  Lyrically the song adds something more to the cliche of being rendered speechless by a lover by declaring that she'll \\"never talk again.\\"  Gaga is definitely an up in coming artist that possesses the talent to become a household name for years to come.  Plus her name strikes a nice chord with Lady Wintermochastar, I feel a long term love between this Lady and Lady Gaga.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|I have become a fan of foreign films because American films are so predictable I have them figured out in the first 15 minutes.  This film kept me guessing (not to mention 'figuring it out').  But I never did have all the details right.  That is very refreshing.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers did not 'appreciate' the ending.  However, I was thrilled that for all his brilliance, Legard was ensnared by the simplest oversight.  By that time all was revealed and you finally come to understand the complexity of the storytelling.<br /><br />One of my all time favorites.<br /><br />Gracias, Senior Almodovar!

B007U1FEJE|5.0|Not since the album \\"The Beach Boys 1985\\" have they REALLY tried to make a good record and with \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" they did!  Since '85 the band has been separate, releasing solo work, re-doing older work, and Mike and Bruce have basically just been touring, but with this release wow! I can't wait for a follow up!  Brian (the most active over the years) dominates this record.  I'm shocked he has so many leads and stoked by it!  I love his voice! Foskett does such a good job with the high notes in particular \\"Shelter\\"  What A Great Song!!!  My favorite \\"Beach Boys Sound\\" (other than Carl's voice) is Al Jardines vocals and he is loud and clear on this, not enough though!! He makes \\"Isn't It Time\\" an Awesome song!!!<br />What makes this one special is the fact that we hear Mike Love with the guys! He is the spokesman and the voice of so many classics that he makes the record full.  Also the sound of the music is definitely Brian's Band, those guys are Good!<br />Hopefully there's an outlet where people can hear this collection.  Nowadays I don't know though?  Maybe come up with a cool video or something but even that option seems to be gone.  Where is music heard?  Radio stations are so set in their ways that none of them will play this, maybe adult contemporary stations?<br />If you like harmonies, fun, nostalgia, and the summer...give this a chance.

I am back on Amazon to see if i can buy another book from this author. By the way, i found this book after listening to the channeling of Bashar on youtube. He recommended this book and now i know why.
0553801473|4.0|How do you review a book like A Dance With Dragons? It has so many different plotlines and characters, some interwoven and some I would say seem to be parts of completely different stories. The thing with A Song of Ice and Fire is that it's the story of a world, not the story of  a specific character, family, or even country, but the story of a whole wide world. As a result, it seems that this book would need to be rated a different amount of stars for each storyline within the book. However, I feel that a book, even if it contains different plotlines who as individuals would receive different ratings, still has an over all feel that can be rated. So here I go.<br />I feel that this book had a great more potential than actually appeared in this book. The plot seemed to have been cut off at the end. Martin spent a thousand pages building up to a climax in each of the different storylines, and that buildup, if sometimes slow, was definitely fun to read.By the time I reached the end of the book I couldn't wait to see the those climaxes happen, to see who would win the war, who would live and who would die. And then those climaxes never happened. Oh, of course Martin promised to have said climaxes at the begining of the next book (Winds of Winter), but then, it's hard to have a climax at the begining of a book isn't it? You don't have the rising action that leaves you thirsting for that final battle, and I think as a result, those potentially great scenes will be merely good. Of course Martin did have his reasons- the book was getting too long. Bu since when has that dettered the great George R. R. Martin? The man who writes 11 hundred paged books? I'm sure he could hae found away to cut off some of the less important chapters at the begining of the book (like Melisandre's chapter- what was the point of that?) and added the few chapters that were necessary to end this book only when it deserved to be ended. I think the only character who I feel came an ending was Daenerys, and I never really liked her chapters anyway.<br />On that note, this was a great read. All the characters are unique, and each has his own interesting story. I can definitely feel that things are approaching the end in the Song (though I'm sure it'll take another 3 if not 4 books to finish it), ad that all the main characters are going to soon come together (Tyrion and Daenerys- anytime soon?)<br />And here's just a few questions before I end with \\"On to the Winds of Winter\\":(spoilers)<br />What on earth is going on with Arya? I can't make any sense of what is happening to her, nor understand why she's important to the story.<br />Brienne. It's pretty clear that she comes to Jaime and asks him to come help her save Sansa- but isn't Brienne dead? I quite clearly remember Catelyn hanging her at the end of A Feast for Crows- did Thoros bring her back to life?<br />Well, that's it for now, so- on to The Winds of Winter!
0345803485|2.0|While the plot was worthy of further investigation, the writing just didn't meet muster and became distracting the more I read.  Too bad, done correctly, it could've been a great story.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|did anyone notice that these awesome ' 5-star' ratings never mention the pay 2 play issue? cause they're FAKE! can we see a 5-star explaination for why you think its ok to charge again to play? since its such an AWESOME game?!
B000060MMI|3.0|Kind of a head banger style of Irish music.  It's OK sometimes but won't be one of my favorite groups.  Has some good tunes on it though.
0670023329|4.0|I found the story fascinating.  The only thing that I could not figure out was his difficulty adjusting. He seemed resentful in many ways as well as willing to work hard until the very end.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|To be honest I've never owned any Van Morrison music before I bought this CD.  I've now listened to all three discs and love the entire collection.  Most of the songs I've never heard before but I didn't find one song that I did not enjoy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very easy to use. The graphic is nice and big,turns my whole kindle screen into a big calculator. Easy to read layout,and display shows you your history as you tally. I use this app all the time.
B007L96VCY|5.0|This is how it's done people. The remastering is excellent. Although this is the first time I've listened to this entire album I've heard some of the individual songs to compare the remastering to. Package is nice also. I love Too Many People among the many other great songs on this record.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I have not seen the A&E version of P and P, but I have read the book, and I love the book!  That being said, I know that some things have to be changed or rearranged, but for me this missed the special feel, the spirit, if you will, of the book.<br /><br />I didn't care for most of the casting choices, but I'm not sure if that dislike was added to by the poor script.  The lead, Knightly, seemed very shallow and as others have said, did a lot of grinning and snarling.  I found it very distracting, almost like she was trying too hard.  She was also making googly eyes at Darcy very early on.  This was an odd choice.  Part of the point of the whole thing was her dislike, almost disgust really, for Darcy.  I'm not sure what they were trying to do with making her eyeing him like that.  I never got the idea she disliked him, so that was a big failing.  She wasn't really much different than her younger sisters.  Her character was the most disappointing for me.  Caroline Bingley was uninspired, and looked like she was wearing her undies or a nightgown during the ball.  Bingley was just silly, Darcy was just boring, and Collins wasn't really that bad and not nearly as irritating as he should be.  The characters in the book are quirky and wonderful, all with depth and layers totally overlooked for this movie.<br /><br />I won't mention some of the other things people have complained about, though I do agree with some of them.  The biggest problem I have with this movie, not even considering the above, it that it bored me.  It was all I could do to sit and watch it.  It was very dull.  That is why I can't understand why they changed so much.  Thankfully I had snacks to occupy me or I would have just turned it off.  I didn't see any magic in it, nothing that made my heart flutter.  I guess I will try the A&E version and hope that it is better.  Thankfully I got this from the library, so I am not out anything.  I am going to buy one when I find one I enjoy, and I hope I do.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I've been using this case for 6 months.  Love that it protects the screen and allows you to stand Kindle up when necessary.  It's great how the Kindle snaps in flush with the screen.  You don't have to worry that it could fall out of the case.  One downfall is the limited choice of colors/styles.  I got one in black and bought the grey for my mother-in-law a few weeks later.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|pay to get the game then pay to play!?!? BS games like this are why the Droid app market is considered inferior to apple. don't waste your data plan.

0345803485|3.0|I have to say I read it because of the hype and because a friend gave it to me.  It was good, but now as good as I expected.  All in all, I don't think I would read it again.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first book was interesting and kept my attention. The Author should have stopped there! The next two books were too weird and hard to follow. Couldn't wait to finish the 3rd book to move on to somethng else!
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|you'd have to pay ME to play this game again. Don't support devs that charge for the game then charge for in app content, AND still put ads in the game.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|If you want to charge me for an app, okay &quot;If it looks good I will pay&quot;.  SERIOUSLY though you are going to put in an In App Purchase options to double dip, &quot;That is GREEDY.&quot; I will not pay even if it is the free app of the day.

David is basically putting forth his life experiences in song but those experiences are relate-able to most anyone.<br />Sit back with your headphones or ear-buds on and your eyes closed and enjoy an amazing musical rock experience.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Played other versions and this one beats the rest.  Loads quick and the picture is very clear.  Lots of fun.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|To be honest, this book in the series feels like reading history, only with more emotions. There was not much going on in this part of the story as this is set after the bloodshed which has left the entire Westeros in utter desolation.However, that despair along with the burning flame to stand up again is what makes this book an interesting prelude to the storm that is about to happen.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Firstly, I would like to say that I am stunned (after having read only HALF of this book) that there are actually complainers out there who want the couple of dollars they spent on this book back! While I empathize with the unspeakable financial straits they must be in to actually spend time complaining about having invested a couple dollars in their acquisition of marketing advice (time that they might have otherwise spent WORKING and MAKING a WHOLE LOT MORE money than a few measly dollars), I must point out that perhaps if they actually studied and applied his clearly BRILLIANT marketing techniques, they might actually have a few coins to rub together! :-D<br /><br />Now, on to the book: as I said I am only halfway through, but I am already SO happy I decided to give this book a chance despite the whiners on this site that very NEARLY persuaded me not to \\"waste\\" my money on it. The book is INCREDIBLE, AMAZING and INSIGHTFUL, and I disagree that John spends a good portion of it bragging about his successes. If you didn't buy it because of his staggering success and your desire to learn the secrets of how he came to be so successful so rapidly, I'm curious.....why DID you buy it???? Didn't we all buy it to learn something from someone who's actually DONE something we haven't?? For me, this book was FANTASTIC!!! Get ready world, because here I come with my franchise of AWESOME books!<br /><br />I love John's pragmatic approach, his can-do attitude, his confidence, and his ability to not only learn from his mistakes but also have the sense and wisdom to be able to carefully scrutinize his tactics and objectively assess what's working and what's not! For those of you who learned very little from his book, I'd like to point out that that lesson in itself would have been worth your money as it was very likely one of the greatest factors contributing to  his success. He carefully analyzed every aspect of his writing/marketing results and adjusted his strategy based on those results. Not market science, perhaps, but hey...common sense is not so common!<br /><br />Thank you, John, for this fantastic book and for all the humor and fun thrown in. I enjoyed it immensely! Cheers, and thanks for sharing your story and strategy with us!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Lisbeth is such a lovable character. The mystery that surrounds her is enchanting and addictive that once you read the first page of the first book in this trilogy, you'll end up reading until the last page of the third book just like what happened to me. This final installment to the trilogy ties up all the loose ends in the previous books beautifully and the turn of events is much more exciting and heart-pounding. Too bad this is gonna be the last.
006197806X|4.0|Pandemonium was close to a 5 star for me, for no other reason than the ending.  The ending ~ grrr!!<br /><br />Oliver has a knack. A gift. A miraculous way of giving you the most infuriating ending possible.  It's quite brilliant really.  If you make it all the way to the ending of the book, you will have to pick up the next book in the series. You can't possibly not want to know what happens next. That was the way of Delirium and it so much more the case with Pandemonium.<br /><br />We catch up with Lena only days after her heart wrenching, emotionally charged escape into the The Wilds. Alone.  She is found, near death, in the woods by a group of Invalids.  She is taken in and nursed back to health and finds herself in the middle of the rebellion.<br /><br />The story jumps from 'Then', her time spent in the Wilds - to 'Now', her time as part of the rebellion in NYC.  Each chapter switches you to the other time frame.  It isn't hard to follow each story (and they do feel like to separate stories) at the same time.  It moves fairly seamlessly.<br /><br />Then deals with Lena learning to survive. Survive the Wilds, survive the loss of Alex. Survive life without all she knows.<br /><br />Now deals with Lena infiltrating the largest political action group fighting for the Cure.<br /><br />Then, she meets a wonderful group of odd-ball characters, including Raven. Raven is a tough, no-nonsense woman who Lena will learn much from.<br /><br />Now, she meets Julian. Julian is the son of the most powerful, most influential supporter of the Cure. Julian is sweet, naive and easy to like.<br /><br />Then, Lena learns to let her old self die.<br /><br />Now, Lena learns to love again.<br /><br />Just as her heart begins to heal, she will learn truths that threaten to break it all over again.<br /><br />I can't say more.  It is too easy to give spoilers away.  If you liked Delirium, you will most certainly like Pandemonium.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun the only reason I would rate this lower is that it doesn't work right. great graphics for the kindle fire get it I mean its free its fun get it already
B006T3RM08|1.0|I love the idea for this product, but it did not work for me. When I put the trackpad into the dock, it was wedged in too tightly at the bottom. Therefore, my trackpad was always in a pressed state and completely unusable. I had to return it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've not read a book that affected me so physically before. Excellent choice for those that have passed the honeymoon phase of their marriage and are looking to spice things up.
B004P1JEWU|4.0|Just recently purchased a Kindle so enjoying the new experience of reading on this device. One minor quibble I have regarding this series of books: on the kindle version of these books the maps normally included at the front of the books are not included. Overall though I think this is a great series of books and I would advise anyone to read the books rather than watching the HBO version on TV.
0143119680|5.0|Ok, I was really skeptical about this book...because I was scared it was going to be twilight all over again.  Boy was I wrong.  This book is for adults.  There is a lot in this book.  I read it from cover to cover and re-read it to catch the things that were a little confusing.  There are so many little clues and intrigues hidden in verses in the alchemical manuscripts, the peoms and songs that are sung.  They all are interconnected.  The love story is lovely and not overdone.  The characters are amazing.  Diana is a strong protagonist, and no she doesn't wait on Matthew to save her.  They are well matched.  I've read the second book (was lucky to receive an Advanced Readers Copy/ARC)...and let me tell you, I will love this series forever.  Just as I loved Harry Potter, just as I loved the Historian.  Read it...take your time, and also the Audio version is outstanding.  The voice actress is really good and makes you feel like you are there with the characters.
B00005S6K8|2.0|A disappointing remake. I prefer the original with Hepburn.<br /><br />Story was not much to begin with, but Hepburn's charm made it enjoyable if predictable tale.<br /><br />The remake uses a homely looking woman, so there is no charm to save the thing.
B0086700CM|3.0|this lags to much otherwise its a great game considering its free please fix I have lost countless games because of the lagging
0307352145|4.0|If I had any doubt that this is a book worth picking up, it was erased when I saw the title of the book directly under this one in the search results. The title? Introverts Suck. Cain's message that the world needs the qualities and strengths that introverts offer is certainly one the extroverts of our world need to hear. The book was fascinating and full of detail on how our world came to exalt extroverts and undervalue introverts. The later chapters that offered some practical tips were helpful but didn't offer as much as I had expected. Still, it's worthwhile and helpful, well written and fascinating reading.
0312117337|5.0|The Osho Zen Tarot is a deck of 79 cards illustrated by artist Ma Deva Padma. These cards emphasize being in the present moment and making the NOW your point of power.<br />The cards come with a substantial companion book that explains the meaning behind each card and introduces eight different spreads.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />~Deck has a nice feel to it, particularly when shuffling<br /><br />~Cards are a creative and spiritual interpretation of the classic Rider-Waite deck<br /><br />~Self explanatory cards are easy for anyone to read<br /><br />~Cards bring you into the present moment<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />~Roman numerals on the Major Arcana (confusing!!!)<br /><br />There is a million things that I love about the Osho Zen Tarot, but my favorite thing is the way they feel. The cards are sturdy enough to be durable, yet bendy enough to shuffle nicely. The finish is somewhere in between matte and glossy, so they aren't annoyingly slippery. Also, the card dimensions are perfect - cards measure 3\\"x 4.25\\" so they are slightly shorter and wider most tarot cards, making them easier to shuffle if you have dainty hands like myself.<br /><br />The Osho Zen Tarot has taken the Classic themes and images of the Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot and re-imagined them from a spiritual, Zen perspective. The result is so refreshing and inspiring! Cards that often leave me feeling cold and hopeless in the Rider-Waite deck, such as the Five of Pentacles, have a real sense of possibility in the Osho Zen deck and it is easy to see ways breaking free from your current struggles.<br /><br />The Osho Zen Tarot re-imagines the traditional tarot in a way that is positive and empowering, but without being too wishy-washy or nauseatingly upbeat. For example, The Ten of Swords is replaced by Rebirth (10 of Clouds), so instead of a guy with ten swords stuck in his back, we see a young boy rising out of a lion which is rising out of a camel. This picture makes it obvious that the card is about rising above and moving through different phases, always evolving. Its so easy to interpret this card in a way that is helpful and empowering.<br /><br />A unique aspect of the Osho Zen Tarot is it's incredible ability to reveal the dysfunction of our minds and the ways in which our egos keep us prisoners - all the while making it possible to identify escape routes and solutions to our problems. For example, \\"Clinging to the Past\\" replaces the Four of Cups and the image is so clear in illustrating what this cards meaning is and what we need to do to instantly feel better.<br /><br />Which brings me to another great aspect of the Osho Zen Tarot - pretty much anyone can read with these cards. Each card has one or two words on it which capture the essence of the card's meaning. So if you have been struggling to learn Tarot and find that a lot of the more traditionally structured decks, such as the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, don't resonate with you, this deck could be your saving grace.<br /><br />Cards that have always stumped me in the Rider-Waite deck are crystal clear in the Osho Zen deck and I find myself thinking \\"oh, now it makes so much sense!\\"<br />Court cards are easier than ever to interpret and you won't ever find yourself staring blankly at the \\"King of Swords\\" thinking \\"what the &^%* does that mean?\\"<br /><br />Buy this deck if:<br /><br />~You have struggled with learning the Rider-Waite deck<br /><br />~You find traditional tarot decks to be kind of scary or negative<br /><br />~Court cards are your nemesis!<br /><br />~You are more concerned with the present moment than the future<br /><br />~You have an interest in meditation and Zen<br /><br />The Osho Zen Tarot is one of my absolute favorite decks and I use it frequently when reading for myself and for professional readings. I find that the Osho Zen Tarot inspires me to live in the NOW and to turn inward in order to understand and change what is going on outside of me. These cards just radiate wisdom. In fact, reading from this deck is like having your own enlightened Zen master sitting in your living room with you!<br /><br />Review originally published on [...]

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really am astounded and totally confused that this book is even remotely popular, much less a best seller.  All I can figure is that a lot of women are happy to finally have something to read that speaks to their secret fantasies. After reading the reviews I didn't think I could go wrong. But honestly - this book is so bad I am actually embarrassed to admit I bought it. The writing is dull, the characters have no depth, the sex scenes are totally unsexy, flat, empty and just plain boring. And I don't know how anyone who can read a map thinks you drive down to Seattle from Portland (please, do your homework!)<br />As others have said, the descriptions are repetitive and trite. (Ana chews her lips, Christian presses his lips in a hard line...blah, blah, blah) There is some great erotica out there, and the popularity of this book is just an insult to all the hard working writers who know what good prose is and bother to edit before publishing. Shame on the editors who let this go out. But who I am I to talk - apparently, none of that matters to the average reader anymore, and despite my opinion and the opinions posted in over 2,000 negative reviews, this awful book keeps selling.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Love, love, love. I couldn't get enough of this book. It truly was a roller coaster ride. I was only 75% of the way through and already thinking that I needed to read it again when I was finished. It has drama, action, romance, sex, gambling, the mob, just about anything you can think of in it. I can't wait for my friends to read it because I know they will love it too. I really hope they make this book into a movie because it would be a great one.<br /><br />Even though I gave it 5 stars, my only complaint was that the editing of the book it bad. I found a number of errors for which I had to tell myself to ignore.

B002IFT1ZA|2.0|OK, I haven't read George R.R. Martin's \\"Game of Thrones.\\" I'll admit that 800 pages in volume one of a 13 volume series does make me wonder what they expect me to do for the rest of my life. But when I heard it had been done into a video series, I decided this might be an easy way to see if reading it might be worth the trouble.<br /><br />\\"Game of Thrones,\\" is very definately a class production. Acting is really great. Costumes and set designs are first rate. And the story line.... Is long, like, I'm afraid the books are. This is not action and adventure, but melodrama. It reminds me of the olden days of T.V. when \\"Dallas,\\" and \\"Dynasty,\\" were all the rage. The characters are oh, so charming to each other, and so viciously rude. Plotting endlessly, changing sides daily. Nobody knows which way is up. And nothing ever happens. Just more of the same. Reminds me of the soap operas my grandmother used to watch of afternoon television, when I was a kid.<br /><br />Sorry. A good effort was made here. But it just isn't to my taste.<br /><br />ccjune

This is the first real sci fi novel I read in 15 years and it is simply fantastic. So many layers, allusions and hidden meanings that I'm sure I missed half of them but the story, the characters and setting all makes for a harrowing, awesome read. Good job!
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|I stay away from any game that wants more to play and I pass on any open feint app which is a storage hog.<br />a paid app with open feint and then has ads??? wow what will they think off next...I will thank you to keep your hands off my wallet. I said it before...open feint needs to be a seperate download and only if I choose to to it.<br />a
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|I will never ever buy a game that tries to make you buy more content. Period. In-app purchasing for already paid for games is criminal... it is disgusting... it is wrong and I refuse to support developers that do this for any reason whatsoever.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|All I can say is \\"Wow!\\"  What a great album!  There are a couple of songs that fall a tad short of the rest (\\"The Secret Life of Bill and Sue\\" immediately comes to mind), yet the good songs are so incredibly good that it doesn't matter if there are a couple of less than perfect anthems.  Most of the songs are GREAT! And the harmonies... OMG!!!  No one does harmony like the Beach Boys, even after 50 years!  Remarkable!  My only complaint, if any, is that there is not enough David Marks here and that Brian does a few too many of the leads... yet as I said, this album is SO SO SO GOOD... none of my little criticisms really matter.  That album is SIMPLY INCREDIBLE!!!!

B00479SVBU|5.0|I have tried several different brands of mp3 FM transmitters and I have to say the Santechi Soundfly AUX is the best. It does what it is supposed to do and it does it well. Does it deliver stunning audiophile quality sound? No, but it is more than adequate for the type of device it is. If you are looking for an easy way to add a playback device to a stock FM radio without a lot of expense and headache this is the way to go. All those other brands I mentioned above, they were returned and I kept the Santechi.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I've been able to get my 4 year old daughter and 70 year old mother in-law to play and enjoy this game.  I told my daughter that the shotguns are camera flashes which scare the zombies.  The push-your-luck variable of this game has lead to more then a few moments of everyone yelling \\"NO WAY!\\" when someone makes a very lucky roll to take the win.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love love love the \\"Hunger Games\\" series.  It seemed each book had an ending unto its self.  Mockingjay (third in the series) seemed to end it entirely.....then again....did it really?  I certainly hope not.  Once you start each book, you can't put it down.  I'm not a science fiction fan, but these books are a MUST read!!!
0307266303|2.0|I picked up Born to Run because of curiosity and glowing reviews. Since publication, it's been nearly impossible to find a magazine or newspaper article about running that doesn't at least indirectly reference barefoot running and the impact this book had on the practice. I was also impressed with the multiple five-star reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Imagine my confusion when I discovered that the book is drawn out, boring, and to be frank, quite poorly written.<br /><br />Christopher McDougal hops all over the place plot-wise. We're looking for the Tarahumara. No, we're looking for Caballo Blanco. No, we're running an ultra marathon with a snarky woman in the Rockies. Wait, we're back to Caballo Blanco? It throws off the pacing of the book, and adds nothing to the structure. Worse, McDougal fails as a writer to direct us along a path. The ricocheting structure offers NO information on why he's talking about any topic. Is the focus of the book the Tarahumara, Caballo Blanco or ultramarathons? It took me nearly half the book to figure out. Additionally, McDougal seems to have an axe to grind with some subjects. Characters (Rick Fisher) receive scathing portrayals while others bob along on puffy clouds with rainbows over their head.  Simile, metaphor and bizarre pop culture references abound. A reference to Lilith Fair? In a book published in 2009? Come on.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, Born to Run contains an intriguing story to be told. When the book effectively telling this story is published, I will be the first to read it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book was dreadful.  My college-age daughter bought it after reading the first one (which was also dreadful).  Neither one of us could finish this book, it was so poorly written.  Needless to say, we won't be buying the third installment.

B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I loved the first book, but this one is even better. It has a great use of words, and I never expected a lot of it. Overall,  an amazing book.<br />One thing I do not like about it,  is that she has a chance of a happy life with Xander, and she throws it away for a guy who's best chance is a quick death. But hey,  you've got to make a story somehow.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It definitely does the trick. I love the huge numbers. It looks very clean and sleek. For easy computing Overall does the job.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|My kids LOVE this movie and there is plenty of good humor for adults to keep me interested (unlike other movies my kids like *cough* Wall-e *cough*). The spanglish humor in the movie is incredibly funny.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I surfed the &quot;paint&quot; like apps,  I read all of the reviews All 374 of them (almost) I have only had my kindle for 2 days.

B001GMH8T2|5.0|This was a wonderful movie! I had first ordered it on Netflix but liked it so much I ordered it off of Amazon! I try to stick with the factual happening movies and this was one of those movies about some kids in a HS that normally doesn't graduate kids but every single kiddo in this basketball coaches care graduated and went not to either become a coach themself or play college sports! Older movie but very good!
B007RKPO84|5.0|United In Hate is the most brutal Kreator song since Coma Of Souls!<br /><br />Do you remember the day's of old when you would go out and pick up your favorite bands new album, back then you would have to rush home and slap that record on the turntable, the music would flow over you and just give you chills. Sometimes this moment was met with disappointment, but we are not talking about Signals here, we are talking about KREATOR. In my opinion the best thrash band of all time and my favorite band since the mid 80's, When I was out record shopping with my buddy Mark hunting down the latest Megadeth boot, or Maiden picture disk I picked up Pleasure To Kill and one listen I was hooked, I have stuck by the band through the years, it was easy to do during the height of the thrash years. I waited for each new release one more brutal than the next, waiting a year, rushing to the store and hearing When the Sun Burns Red or arguably the best riff in thrash metal history Coma Of Souls was a well deserved reward for patiently awaiting for a new Kreator album. I liked Renewal, I still listen to it, if I had to say anything negative about Kreator it would be that I really missed Ventor when he was not on tour, Mille can write some Kick ass songs, but live I think Ventor holds the band together in a live setting.<br /><br />If you have not heard this album yet, get ready because, it has been YEARS since I have listened to an album that just gives me chills, this album makes me proud to be a fan of Kreator. Thrash never went away in some parts of the world, but it's comeback is really going to get a kick in the ass here in the states with this new album!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow. Talk about a marriage (& people!) gone wrong. I finished this novel this morning and am still trying to process how I feel. On the one hand, it had me riveted, especially toward the end. On the other, I still feel slightly disturbed . . . and I'm not yet sure if that's a good or bad thing.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I read it. A lot of twists and turns. Flynn is a talented writer who really makes you think. In this case, it has me thinking about how easily marriages can unravel and go sour when partners begin taking each other for granted. Thankfully, there are no sociopaths involved in mine though. ;)
B007SGM084|4.0|Its a fun read based on just how different it is. NOt great literature by anymeans. By the third book I was skimming over the sex scenes but the story was just enough to keep me reading on. A fun beach read.  Made me wish I was in my 20's again!!!
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|Pay 2 play?  Please! Bad idea.<br />Go look up OpenFeint's track record regarding mis-use of customer account information.<br />Stupid move miniclip.  Now you are on the 'no fly' list for me too.

B007U2ABXM|5.0|I always look forward to a new Patti Smith release. Been way too long since the last but as expected, \\"Banga\\" is everything another perfect Patti Smith record would be. \\"Maria,\\" \\"This is the Girl\\" and \\"April Fool\\" are stellar tracks. Patti Smith/punk fans, you will not be disappointed. [...] This album is awesome.
B00003CXA6|5.0|i love this movie a lot.  this is not like any John Wayne movie with a horse chase that lasts for 1/4 % of the movie.  or a stupid bar fight over nothing.  every thing in here was how it was.  you see how the lived through the war although there is not much hospital shots.  non of it is for humor.  this is long.  if you do not like long movies still watch this because one of the greatest ever made.
0307277887|4.0|Dexter Morgan is no ordinary employee of the Miami Police Department. Yes, he comes to work every morning bearing breakfast for the staff, he lives in a normal apartment, and he even has a steady relationship with a woman. There is, however, a side to Dexter that none of his coworkers would ever expect. Dexter Morgan is a serial killer. In this novel by Jeff Lindsay, the reader is granted access to the mind of Miami's resident murderer. This inventive take on a serial killer is sure to delight readers, and have them rooting for the bad guy.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|just what the title says.  is this a vampire series or a soap opera.  the lamest thing out there.  do not waist your time and money.  you will thank me.
0553801473|2.0|Much and more of this book was as useless as nipples on a breastplate. Words are wind after all. Sad to say, but this one learned little and less in the book's forty and eleven hundred pages than he had hoped of the goings-on in Westeros, and much and more about how badly GRRM needs a braver editor.
B002BWP49C|1.0|as if there is not enough lameness out there.  see the way i know about this my sister gots the movies.  and what let me get this straight a lame actress married a lame actor.  there in no point. to it at all.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie is a testimony that despite your background, you can still make it in this world. Sandra Bullock's character is a force to be reckoned with. Kathy Bates played her part very well. People are able to learn in different ways other than just reading textbooks.
B00007AJGH|5.0|i love who framed roger rabbit a lot.  this movie is about this detective helping this toon out with wife.  next thing you know the law is after them and they are on the good team.  i will not tell you any more just watch this movie.  this is probably one of the only movies to have characters from Disney, paramount and Warner brothers.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I am not versed in movie reviews so there will be no eloquent or exotic use of words and this will be brief. I did not see the movie for free nor did I pay $9 at a theater - I rented it from Amazon for $4 and watched it in the comfort of my living room. And the only reason I wanted to see this movie was because of the horrible reviews it received.<br /><br />What did you folks smoke before you saw this movie? My mouth was wide open, literally, right up to the last closing credit, the music stopped and the TV screen turned black; this movie was G.R.E.A.T! It was so good in fact, I had a hard time understanding why so many critics dumped on it. Just another reason I typically do not read reviews. There was romance (Lynn Collins - 10X hotter without makeup), comedy (Woola my favorite new pet), some gore (nothing a 13 year old would cringe at), some western, plenty of sci-fi, a good guy with confused priorities (cave of gold or the hot chick) and great special effects. And again Woola; the funniest part of the movie. If only my dogs could run 250mph!<br /><br />So in closing, to rate this movie any less than 4-stars is paramount to committing a sin. Every actor/actress played their part without fault, the effects were ridiculously good and really, who cares if it was not literal to the book(s), which I did read; this movie is a western/sci-fi/romance/comedy not a documentary!<br /><br />On a side note, I am glad to see Ghost Protocol received less favorable ratings; awful movie that I was stupid enough to purchase for $19 on blu ray. Never again Tom.
B006CS7UXO|4.0|This compilation comes highly recommended - devout followers will not be disappointed by the typically eclectic mix of music on offer.  A must have purchase for your CD collection.

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|After twenty years, Joe Walsh has finally recorded a new solo album, Analog Man.  I'm a huge fan of not only his 70's work, but also his 80's albums, although the last two were certainly losing much interest from me.  So I was keeping my expectations low on this one, particularly since his contributions to the last Eagles album were extremely unfulfilling as well.<br /><br />Happily, this new disc is a very strong one from Joe, full of diverse and rewarding songs.  It's got a bit of everything from the different \\"eras of Joe\\".  The title track is a classic Walsh single, and sits well alongside his other classics.  Great lyrics, structure, instrumentation, and very apropos for where he's coming from.  Other strong songs with single-potential are the wonderfully infectious \\"Hi-Roller Baby\\" (the only tune Joe doesn't have a writing credit on) and \\"The Band Played On\\" which features a little eastern instrumentation and some biting social/environmental commentary -- go Joe!  He goes back to his roots with a short but sweet \\"Funk 50\\" which stays true to the theme of the previous Funks, and also does a nice instrumental called \\"India\\".  I also really like \\"Spanish Dancer\\" which combines a smooth flamenco vibe with an unexpected funk bridge in the middle.<br /><br />Be sure to get the \\"Bonus Version\\" of the album for an extra buck or two which includes 2 bonus tracks and a nice 16 minute video with live workings of 3 of the songs contained herein, and little snippets of interviews with Joe.  More importantly, it includes one of the best rockers on the album called \\"Fishbone\\" which really should have been included on the regular album -- it rocks! Kind of similar to \\"Fun\\" from Got Any Gum?  The other bonus track is a 1970 lost tape of the James Gang with Little Richard on lead vocals and piano...not an incredible song, but a nice piece of history.<br /><br />I had been apprehensive about Jeff Lynn producing some of these tracks.  While I enjoy ELO, I really got sick of his production formula with the Wilburys, George Harrison and Tom Petty as well as his solo work.  Fortunately it only shows up minimally here, but it is present.  However, he had a strong hand to play in getting Joe to finish the album, so I give him credit for that.  There's a few more serious tunes/ballads as well, mostly about his gratitude for his wife & family, and for AA getting him out of his alcoholic multi-decade run.  Then there's the country-tinged lyrical follow up to \\"Life's Been Good\\" which is called \\"Lucky That Way\\".  Those songs are good for the posterity, but I won't be playing them too often...I much prefer the fun rockers.<br /><br />So, overall it's a successful album. Nothing quite as ambitious as the track \\"The Confessor\\", but very pleasant and rewarding most of the way through.  It's so great to hear some of his classic lead guitar work again -- he truly stands out in a crowd!  This has the potential to spark a come-back of sorts for his solo career, and he says he's continuing to write new material.  I can't wait for his solo tour this summer, and look forward to hearing the new tunes alongside old favorites!  How ya doin'?
1937986039|5.0|I've been a professional photographer for over 40 years, starting with 5X7 b&w sheet film and now working with digital. I was looking for the best small camera to carry at all times everywhere, and after much online research bought the Fujifilm X10. I have not been disappointed.<br /><br />However, even though the X10 came with a pretty good instruction book, it still left many questions unanswered--and the same questions also went unanswered on the Internet. For instance, can you use exposure compensation in the EXR mode? When using EXR (which is one of the main reasons to buy this camera), what are the best settings to use? Is Program Mode better than the EXR mode? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?<br /><br />The author answers all of these questions in clear English, all accompanied by photographs to illustrate his descriptions and explanations, and (important) a good table of contents and index.

0385340567|1.0|I stumbled upon Lee Child's Reacher series some months back and began to ravenously devour each and every tome I could get my hands on...until \\"Nothing to Lose.\\"  What an abomination and what an absolute aberration from the triumphs of his past efforts.<br /><br />The book was written during the height of the Iraq War and regrettably, the author, Child, could not help but infuse his left-wing politics into this dog.  He manages to hit on most of the liberal talking-points of the day including anti-Bush and anti-Iraq War rhetoric all while cheaply wrapping the plot-line around a villainous born-again Christian.  Please!<br /><br />Aside from some minor technical miscues and the painfully slow, meandering pace, the biggest disappointment is that he chose to sully our beloved apolitical antagonist, Reacher, with his personal dogma.  Reacher's anti-military, pro-desertion rant was so far out of character that it was actually uncomfortable to read.  Again, I hope this is an aberration - everyone is entitled to lay a rotten egg from time-to-time.  One can only hope there is a forthcoming \\"Dallas moment\\" wherein we next find Reacher in the shower and learn it was all just a bad dream!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|loved the content - kept me flipping pages. that being said, the writing is horrible. the dialogue sounds forced and archaic. i was reminded of the harlequin romances i was addicted to when i was 13. in spite of this, i'm reading the second book!

B000FCKGPC|4.0|Needing a bit of escapism now, I just finished reading this book within about two weeks, and thus have read now the first four volumes of this series within two months.  This compressed schedule may have helped make the plot easier to follow, but it is admittedly a convoluted and sometimes frustrating plot to follow.  I'm not going to try hard to avoid plot spoilers, so don't read on if that's a problem for you.    As some have said, it is true we have many characters who seem to wander in pursuit of purposes we can predict they will not achieve.  It's hard to invest in characters we know won't arrive where they are trying to go, nor mostly to achieve what they intend.  That's not to say the plot is overly predictable -- that which frustrates our characters' goals is usually quite a plot twist.    The problem I see here is that the first three books led me to find three characters very interesting -- Tyrion, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen.  Now, the plots drift off to bring in many new folks and tells us little about these three.  In other words, the disappointment is more who is not much here than who and what is in this book.    I entirely disagree with those who say not much happens.  True, the reader does sense much of the material is set up for plot action to come, which has not arrived by the end of this volume.  But plenty happens, too.  The final major resistance to the Lannisters is ended the War of Five Kings.  Cersei and Jamie grow apart but their characters develop considerably.  Sansa makes it to safety in the Vale with her Aunt only to have Petyr kill the Aunt and re-create great uncertainty for Sansa.  Stannis shows up with his whole army on the Wall.  The Septs are becoming a major force.  Dorne and the Iron Islands were just places barely mentioned, but now we have real development of what those places are about.  We see that Westeros is slowly learning that there are live dragons again, leading more than one to ship off in search of Daenyris, whobuy the way becomes a conquering Queen.  We learn the dead Catelyn seems to have come back to life in some form.  Not much happening?    Yet I would like to have seen something about where Bran is, and why he is heading north of the Wall, among many other subplots that are nearly absent.  All the same, after reading reviews I wondered if I really wanted to bother with this book and the next.  The answer is that after finishing this, I downloaded book five to my Kindle the same day.    Part of the problem is that the author has a very big plot line to flesh out, and his style is anything but terse.  He lists the names of ships after mentioning a fleet, lists of house names, lists of relatives and members of a family, etc., etc., etc., Zzz-z-z.  I lost nothing by skipping over them.    This led to the author's well-known problem writing this, which creates a problem for this volume.  He says he hit over 1500 pages and had much more to go, which he knew would be unacceptable to publishers.  He decided to divide the book in two by subjects.  This one covers events in Westeros, and the next is more focused on the East.  That clumsy choice suggests the next volume will have similar plot line problems.    A big problem for Kindle users - no maps!  The paper books include maps that help enormously, as following the plot without understanding more than the narrative clearly provides about what is where is near impossible.  Kindle includes the maps, but with no ability to magnify them reading even major place names is challenging.  I suggest book marking [...] for a pretty good map which includes the East, which the books' maps do not.    My fear is that this series may never finish.  The author says he plans seven volumes, and so far has five.  The last is less than a year old as of this writing.  So when will Book six be out?  Book seven?  And will they really complete the story arc?  Or will the seven volume plan be like George Lucas' comments when Star Wars came out, that he planned a nine episode epic only to say after six he had no idea what more to do with the story line, and would make no more?    Finally, a short glossary might help.  It's frustrating to hear King's Landing is building \\"drommonds\\" without much about what sort of ship that is, for example.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been on a book slump lately- having not found a reasonable one that truly captivated my interest in over a year. Wool Omnibus changed that.<br /><br />It was a relief to read a well written book with continuous movement. By this I mean that there were very few slow spots that usually ruin books for me. It is not an action packed book by any means, but the story moves forward at a relentless pace encouraging the reader to continue the adventure.<br /><br />To discuss the content of the book is to ruin its very premise. You don't really find out what the world is all about until the end.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and will certainly read more from this author. I've already bought [[ASIN:0982611919 Molly Fyde and the Parsona Rescue]] and will start it soon.
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm not a person who likes to read very often , but I was told to read this book by a few people so I did, and I was very surprised I couldn't put it down. The book is very well written and leaves you wanting more , I hope the author will be writing more in the future , and if it's just as good as this was , she will be my favorite author and I will be buying all her books.
B00005RHGL|5.0|I was talked into watching this movie by a friend.  I told him I don't like westerns but he kept at me so I finally gave in and watched.  This movie is great!  It is very well cast, lots of stars in smaller roles, tons of action, lots of memorable lines, etc.  I have watched it several times already.  And the vista series version has lots of good extras.
030758836X|5.0|It's hard to write a review of this novel without spoiling it.  Let's see, it's Sly, Devilish, Nerve-Wracking, Original, Imaginative.<br /><br />The plot is mostly solidly believable, so much so it should come with a WARNING:<br /><br />THIS BOOK MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO YOUR MARRIAGE, particularly if you suffer from Bellicosity, Duplicity, Perfectionism, Quotidian Nagging or any other condition which has, within the past 12 months, led to the the precipice of Divorce.<br /><br />This is just a great novel I had to keep reading and reading until I finished.

0385344228|1.0|I was hoping to find a dark, developed, noir sort of crime novel. What I ended up with is a hackneyed, trite, mundane plot which used anger to signify ... oh, every emotion. Characters under stress? Then let them yell at each other, do incredibly stupid things, and justify it all in the name of \\"family\\". Oh please. Nothing in this book came across as real to me. That's too bad, as the author does show some good skill ... but then seems to get swamped by the convoluted plot.
B0086700CM|1.0|it wouldnt even come up!!! i play it on my friends and was so excited when it came out but i was very sad....
0812550706|3.0|This is supposedly a Sci-Fi Classic, and Card almost made the grade. Is it good? Absolutely. And sometimes surprising. Yet, the plot seems repetitive and the main character doesn't evolve much. So does it belong with the greats of that genre? Hmmm. I don't think so. Oh, I still highly recommend it, but only because it sets up a much greater book, its sequel \\"Speaker for the Dead\\". Combine these 2 together, and then you do have a true classic, a truly great unfolding of a unique character.

1596912375|4.0|\\"Restless\\" performs a neat trick in paralleling the past and the present stories then melting the two into one.  One small complaint:  the Reuben Jones, the destroyer sunk by the Germans in the book, was in fact the Reuben James in real life.  I'm surprised at a writer as good as Boyd is would let a small fact like this not be double checked.  Inexcusable.
B007Q1VUFA|4.0|This is an hugely enjoyable \\"solo\\" album from the fomer Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, He has one of the greatest rock' n' blues voices in the business and sounds like he is having a \\"high' old time surrounded by a bunch of seasoned musicians who clearly have sampled some otherworldly inspiration to produce a set of seven tracks with the shortest clocking in at 7.08 minutes. The new outfit backing him includes former Crowes members as well as guitarist Neil Casal from Ryan Adams' band The Cardinals. The latter did a fair share of homages to the music of the Grateful Dead when he was with Adams not least a great version of \\"Wharf Rat\\" which they regularly played live. Equally Chris Robinson has been joined on stage by the Dead's Bob Weir in European festivals and thus it is no surprise that it is to the inspirers of Ben and Jerry's greatest ice cream that he has turned for his primary inspiration with \\"Big Moon Ritual\\". The kick off track the excellent \\"Tulsa yesterday\\" has those lifting and effortless Jerry Garcia style guitar runs which centred on melody rather than showy theatrics. It could have happily fitted on the jazzy improvisation of the Dead's \\"Wake of the flood\\" and is nearly 12 minutes of cosmic style jamming interspersed with Robinson excellent vocals. It is followed by the rambling and powerful \\"Rosalee\\" where the band break at 6 minutes to chant the \\"airs getting thinner, are we are getting high\\". in this reference you suspect that Robinson et al might not be referring to altitude sickness and the track pile drives out over a frantic funky backdrop to its conclusion. Check the band perform this on the Jay Leno show and try not be struck by the feeling that you have harked back in time travel to the heyday of 70s Southern Rock as the screen fills with long hair and even longer beards. The pace slows for the bluesy ballad \\"Star or stone\\" which is matched latter by the even better tender ballad \\"Reflections on a broken mirror\\" where Robinson voice is worth the price of entry alone. \\"Tomorrows blues\\" evoking memories of the Allman Brothers with its dual guitar play and extended workout.<br /><br />You probably get the drift by now of the shape of this album and frankly if your not a fan of extended jams or free flowing psychedelic soloing \\"Big Moon Ritual\\" will irritate you like a plague of Midges in the Scottish Highlands. The swirling cosmic concluding track \\"One hundred days of rain\\" probably takes the prize as the strongest song in the entire set and is a fitting conclusion to nearly 60 minutes of fine music. For those expecting anything like the R'n'B rock outs of the Crowes debut album please go elsewhere, indeed there are a few occasions when you feel that a little less length and a bit more punchy economy would have served up a better result. These are however minor qualms since \\"Big moon ritual\\" transports you back to those pre punk days of the Grateful Dead, Little Feat and Quicksilver Messenger Service where \\"going off on one\\" was positively encouraged and a weed inspired spirit of adventure fuelled some fine expansive music. It is said that the band recorded 27 songs in this session and that another album will arrive later this year. If they follow the same template employed here you had better clear a couple of months to fit it in and cancel Christmas!is worth the price of entry alone. \\"Tomorrows blues\\" evoking memories of the Allman Brothers with its dual guitar play and extended workout.<br /><br />You probably get the drift by now of the shape of this album and frankly if your not a fan of extended jams or free flowing psychedelic soloing \\"Big Moon Ritual\\" will irritate you like a plague of Midges in the Scottish Highlands.

B004L3AQLU|4.0|\\"Love and Other Drugs\\" combines a story that does not fit into any neat categories with an R rating for language and sex. This probably explains its lackluster box-office performance in the U.S. since we like our films to fit into single predictable genres and we would rather watch beheadings than a couple enjoying sex. Witness the complaint from the \\"most helpful negative review\\" that the movie can't decide what it wants to be.<br /><br />Based on a pharmaceutical salesman's memoir, \\"Love and Other Drugs\\" is messy, like life. There's some great comedy, some hard hits at corrupt, profit-driven health care industries and a nation that wants every problem fixed instantly with a pill, some very hot chemistry between stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, and serious  reflection about the rewards and challenges of foregoing instant gratification for authentic commitment, whether to a relationship, or a career, or any other endeavor. Funny, sad and serious at the same time, it's like an indie film with an A-list cast.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jamie Randall, a young man who lacked the attention span to finish college and backs into pharmaceutical sales after he is fired from his home electronics sales job for having sex at work. He's charming, smart, attractive and driven to succeed, but he lives entirely on the surface, with no introspection and never caring much about anything or anyone. While on a sales call, he meets Maggie Murdock, a young artist suffering from early-onset Parkinson's. Both of them just want casual sex initially, Jamie because that's what he's like and Maggie because she won't ask anyone to stick with her long-term knowing where her disease will take her. Gradually they come to mean more to each other than either of them planned.<br /><br />Both Gyllenhaal and Hathaway give the best performances I've seen from them. I cannot believe how much Hathaway has grown as an actress since \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" She really does an amazing job capturing Maggie's mixture of pride, passion, fear and self-pity. Gyllenhaal, perfectly cast as the smooth-talking superficial Jamie who discovers more to himself than he ever suspected, reveals heretofore hidden comedic gifts. There are some nice supporting bits from Oliver Platt as Jamie's bitter sales partner Bruce, Josh Gad as Jamie's geeky brother who takes over his couch after his wife kicks him out of his house, and Hank Azaria as one of Jamie's doctor customers.<br /><br />\\"Love and Other Drugs\\" sags and repeats itself at times, and backs itself into an inevitable corner between sentimentality and cynicism when it comes to the ending (probably handled as well as can be expected), so I can't give it five stars. However, it's a solid four stars for the fine performances and a story that will keep you thinking long afterwards.

B007ZRZF8I|1.0|First off, I won't mention how. Just do some digging on Google to find out how to unlock all of the content you have to pay for, for free. You can do it as many times as you want and on just about any other game for that matter.<br /><br />I am also sick of games charging twice.<br />Free to play games can rightfully have in-app purchases because that's their source of income.<br />It's justifiable to me when you are paying to unlock all levels, or to unlock 'premium' items that aren't available otherwise. To me, that's ok to do. On FREE games, though.<br />Paying once for the game and then having to pay again, not only once, but every time you run out of things, is ridiculous.<br /><br />And isn't this game completely free on their site in flash form? Hmm.<br /><br />If you know what method I'm talking about, please don't mention it on a games review (Play Store/Amazon, etc). We don't want the devs patching it!<br />:)<br /><br />PS: Your phone/tablet needs root access to unlock the content for free.<br />Google how to root your device if you aren't already rooted. You won't regret it one bit.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Received the package today and was amazed to see two card board package and good inner packing for a bag.. Thanks to Amazon for that..<br /><br />Regarding the product I actually went for this product after lot of research between Canon and AmazonBasics. Wanted to give a try as I just returned a Case Logic bag because of its size and weight..<br /><br />There are few things which I like and listing it here for future buyers<br />1) Light weight with 2 straps one for chest and 1 to tie in waist.. Its not mandatory to use chest if it doesnt fit..<br />2) I'm a lean person and definitely cant take lot of weight on shoulders for longer duration esp during a full day shoot.. This light weight is an awesome find for short and lean person like me<br />3) it can hold the Tripod, and has lot of compartments inside for all the DSLR needs and has 4 straps which can be used for covering the lens and costly equipments..<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful..
B007UWBQEU|5.0|This is Carrie Underwoods best CD by far.  I would highly recommend this CD for everyone who enjoys the new country music.  I think Carrie Underwood is one of the best Country Artist around.

B0034G4P9E|5.0|I really don't care for mixed martial arts.  I find it brutal and distasteful.  I sometimes will catch it on tv and watch a little with fascination, wondering why anyone would like to do this for a living.  I heard thru reading reviews in newspapers and magazines that this was a pretty good movie, so I decided to give it a try.  If I hadn't read them, I probably wouldn't have given it a second thought.  Well, this was one of the best movies of last year.  I was so surprised how well this story was written, directed and acted.  Most of all, Warrior had the biggest heart of all of the best picture nominees of 2011.  A movie hasn't made me cry in a long time, but this one did.  I highly recommend this movie, especially for those who may pass because they don't like the sport. It may surprise you.  It surprised me and I will be purchasing it for my collection.

092389165X|5.0|This book comes from the angle of the six people personally effected by the bombing of Hiroshima. I have only ever learned about this event from the view of America, as the people who dropped the bomb, so I only learned why we dropped the bomb and general statistics. This book was a great change-up and very eye-opening concerning the reality of the bombing. I would recommend this book to all readers, as it is an important event in history and this book provides the story from a survivor's perspective.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|So you've seen the previews, you get the occasional glimpse of a colosseum fight the back of some guy with leather straps and a sword and the words John Carter. That's what Disney put on it's trailers at least. Let me tell you my friends that this movie is grander than that and frankly Disney made a huge mistake tanking this movie and letting it go to waste it is beautiful. From the imagery, the technology, and yes the soundtrack this movie is a wonderful adventure that can only be summed up with the often misused word \\"epic\\".<br /><br />I only hope John Carter of Mars achieves success in blu ray sales etc. to show the industry that they can't just tank a film and spend precious resources on sub par films just to turn a quick buck. Anyways... watch the film, pay for it, enjoy it, you won't regret it.
0345803485|1.0|I never write reviews about a book, but this one is so terrible I can't keep it to myself. I only got it because of all the hype this book has been receiving, so I thought - wow, it must be good. Total opposite. The writing is very very poor. If I have to read again about her blushing or biting her lip...<br />Not to mention- the book is so unrealistic. I don't know what's more annoying, the unrealistic story line, or how stupid the girl is to even consider signing his documents. Didn't she graduate from college?
0571238343|5.0|This book really doesn't need a long review so I won't right one. I'll just break this down in simple point format:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- it has in-depth information on EVERYTHING pertaining to animation<br />- all the drawings help provide a clear understanding of what you read<br />- the cost of the book is ridiculous for the amount of info you're getting<br /><br />In short (shorter than the afore mentioned points) this is the Animator's Bible!!! Every animator should own a copy of this book, and so too should anyone who's interested in becoming an animator. I STRONGLY recommend it!

B004USLWVE|3.0|As a current owner of the Tamrac Adventurer 9 and a wedding photographer, I really wanted to love the Evolution 9 backpack.  And in almost every design aspect I did.  However, the achilles heel is the strap system.<br /><br />PROS:<br />It holds a ton of gear.  I was able to carry a custom bracket (flash bracket), LED lights, lens hoods, and a 36-pack of AA batteries in the upper portion of the bag.  In the lower portion, I was able to fit a 5D body w/grip, 24-70, 70-200, 14L, 24L, 35L, 85L, 135L, 100L, and 580 flash with attached bounce.  The double access panels and the abundance of zippered pouches were really convenient for quick access to gear.  I love the design of my Adventurer 9 bag and the Evolution 9 really increased the overall convenience and functionality.<br /><br />CONS<br />However, because the designers were trying to add sling functionality (eliminating one of the straps), they designed straps that are ¾\\" to a full inch narrower than more traditional backpack straps.  In addition, the padding is far thinner than other photography backpacks I've used.  I shot two outings with this bag, the first was for 4 hours and by the end of it, my back and shoulders were very sore.  After the first outing, I wanted to return the Evolution 9, but I loved the other design elements so much that I decided to give it another try.  I purchased 2\\"x10\\" foam [[ASIN:B004DYVO18 Seat Belt Shoulder Pads - MOMO Style #1 Black/Red - Pair]] for the straps, hoping that the additional width and padding would make the bag more usable.  The next opportunity I had to use it was for 2.5-hour evening shoot.  By then end of it, I knew I had to return the Evolution 9, even with the extra padding, my back and shoulders were really sore.<br /><br />My feelings on the bag are mixed.  With the exception of the strap design, I love every other design element.  But in my opinion, the strap design is not adequate for the amount of gear that the Evolution 9 is designed to carry.<br /><br />Myrecommendation depends on your usage scenario.  If you carry your gear to a location and leave it sitting there until you need to travel to a new location, then the Evolution 9 could be a very good solution for you.  However, my style is to carry my gear with me as I hit multiple locations in a short amount of time, and in this usage scenario, the thin strap design make the Evolution 9 completely unusable.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I love books that are part of a series.  Finished Hunger Games, loved it.  Finished this book, second of the series, quickly.  My only two complaints are; too short and not enough detail in the games.  I love these evolving characters in such a fictionalized setting, making it a different kind of read.  Again, the author didn't feel the need to add foul language or explicit sex and still delivered a riveting, wonderful book.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I get the feeling that this fantastic and amazing movie was purposely \\"assassinated\\" by warring interfactional \\"tribes\\" or individuals within Disney itself. Also complicit in this murder were the pretentious critics who probably never read books as children and cannot comprehend a movie that reflects as best it can the incredible imagination of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Imagine that this series of books was written in 1912, before any form of air travel existed on earth except for balloons. Yet Burroughs creates a world of sophisticated technology being used for baser instincts (war) and for sustaining all life on the planet. He created a planet with 2 equally intelligent species and illustrated how culture can determine the growth of each individual within that culture. And he created a smashing good story that has survived for 100 years. This movie was lovingly made with fine attention to incredible CGI effects that really places the viewer within the fantasy world of Mars that Burroughs created so long ago. The movie has adventure and great zest and charm. Some critics said there wasn't enough character development. Perhaps someone should tell them that Burroughs wrote adventure stories, not psychological thrillers. I truly loved this movie, and it pinged with a very small boy within myself who sat in the backyard in the summer immersed in the Burroughs series of John Carter related books. I feel great sadness for the vicious critics who somehow missed that phase of a child's life. If you like adventure set in a world of fantasy, you will love this movie. This movie deserves to be enjoyed and loved. I feel it will long outlive its negative critics that helped ensure it bombed in its movie distribution. I actually can see this becoming a great cult favorite over the years and perhaps help Disney recoop the massive sums used to make Barsoom (Mars) real.

0385360169|2.0|Hello all, I don't usually write reviews - but HAD to on this one - I LOVED Christian - WHO WOULDN'T - LOLOLOL - Anastasia's charachter can be found in ANY historical romance.  I got so tired of her \\"Holy (fill in the blank)\\"  These books were very poorly written - for the teenaged mind - but for the sake of it - I read the trilogy finished all of them so I could be fair.  For some reason Christian was a Black man in my mind - :-) - Don't know why.  Anyway - if you want VERY light summer reading go for it - just don't expect this to be GREAT reading. I stopped reading Historical Romance Novels 20 yrs ago - but I had a keeper - \\"Whitney My Love\\" the characters are exactly the same - only that book was well written :-).  I DO NOT recommend buying this book - and certainly won't be purchasing a movie ticket.

B0083GCK5G|5.0|The Beach Boys have still got it, but it's a shame they don't use \\"it\\" on every song. At least half the album is pretty solid, with occasional glimmers of their '60s greatness shining through otherwise contemporary production values, as if through a magical musical wormhole. Stand-out tracks include the album opener (\\"Think About The Days\\") and the last three songs, which form a suite similar to those on Pet Sounds and Smile. Most questionable production choice is the use of autotune on \\"Spring Vacation.\\" Otherwise, they sound great and it's fantastic to see that the Beach Boys didn't die in a place called Kokomo.
0345803485|1.0|Okay first of all, I live this lifestyle, I happen to be a Domme not a sub but I do know a lot of sub females and males. This story is filled with EVERY CLICHE IN THE BOOK. I shudder to think about the people reading it who think this is the actual reality of what a Dom/sub relationship is like. They are going to show up at the club, want to try everything, and whine when it isn't exactly like the book, it sucks even more cause I know ADULT WOMEN who are praising it like it's the bible when I write FAR BETTER erotica than this stuff and it goes unnoticed because I dunno IT DIDN'T START OUT AS A FRACKIN TWILIGHT FAN FICTION!<br /><br />This book is like CRAP had a BABY and then VOMITED into a PEN and a pile of retarded amoebas wrote it. I would rather read Twilight BY CHOICE than any more of this. In fact what I have read from Twilight is FAR better written than this, even though Meyers RUINS Vampire canon by making them sparkle instead of you know BURN HORRIBLY IN THE SUN but even that is way more genius than the 30 seconds it took for this author to google the terms \\"BDSM\\" and \\"Dom/sub\\" Before writing this pile of trash. The backlash is going to be immense, people will pay to get into my favorite club cause they have to, and when we show them they legally can't come in without signing a release they are going to whine and leave and then complain that the book is not reality and let me tell you right now IT'S NOT! I have done this for years, TRAINED in it, studied it, read BOOKS about it, this is NOT what you want to read to get a good idea of WHAT IT'S LIKE PERIOD!<br /><br />If you actually want a realistic intro to the lifestyle I can suggest books that Master's have had me read that are highly reccommended and praised as realistic and educational. Do not buy into the garbage it's trash and it's someone banking off of someone else, it's nothing more than that. Flame me all you want but I know I could write a better book than this in a night.

B007ZRZF8I|3.0|Mosr of these reviewers are criticizing the game because it offers in-app purchases along with ads.  What every single one of them are neglecting to mention is that the in-app purchase is not mandatory to play the game. It's completely possible to play through the whole game without spending any more money. They're for extra items if you run out. Some people are not very good and are willing to pay for extra help.  If it's not your thing, then no one is forcing you to buy it.<br />  I am of the opinion that a good mobile game should cost more than a dollar. If an Xbox or Playstation game costs $65, than a decent mobile game should cost, at minimum, $5. But most people have gotten into thinking that every game should be free, like the developer has nothing better to do than provide people with free entertainment, or they're just to cheap to support a developer with a few dollars for their well designed product. If a developer puts out a well made game, they are entitled to ask for the dollar AND include ads. Think of it as subsidizing your purchase. Most developers are regular people doing this in their spare time on the side, not some big game company like EA. People need to realize that a good game is more valuable than a dollar. Just because Rovio, the company behind Angry Birds, can afford to offer an ad-free version for $1 doesn't mean everyone can. You people are getting good games for pennies, or free, and have the nerve to complain if there's a small ad? Be thankful that the developers have another source of income so you're able to get the game cheap.<br />  Almost every negative review knocks the ads or the in-app purchases. Not one mentions the gameplay. Stop acting like little kids and expecting something for nothing all the time. No one is entitled to get a complete game for $1, or free. Just because other games sell for those prices doesn't necessarily mean that they all have to. Review the game for what it is and not what you expect. If you don't like it then you're always free to make your own. After dozens of hours of work lets see if you want to just give it away.it then you're always free to make your own.

B007JM4CWY|4.0|This game is fun and addictive with easy controls...my only complaint is that although there are several hundred puzzles, some of the pictures are repeated on a harder level...I am just starting level 5, having played all puzzles in order from the beginning,  but if I see one more weightlifter I might scream. Still an excellent and challenging game worth your time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The entire trilogy was an excellent read.  I had never read a book like this, however, it was so tastefully done, that I would not hesitate reading this type of book or series again.  Hopefully, the author has more to offer in the future.

1400052181|5.0|Rebecca Skloot has done a fantastic job of investigative journalism here to tell the story of the cells that were taken from a cancer patient at Hopkins without her knowledge and have now been propagated around the world.  The discovery that their mother's cancer lives on in freezers in scientific labs worldwide has caused enormous pain and confusion for her family, and this book reveals what every basic scientist and clinician needs to understand about scientific literacy (and illiteracy) and how bewildering the worlds of science and medicine can be to those with no experience in either realm.  As a basic scientist myself, this book has educated and haunted me.  A must-read.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|The \\"Don Giovanni\\" produced for the 1953 Salzburg Festival was an immense success. Thus, the producer Paul Czinner persuaded the Festival Direction, the cast and Furtwängler to take part to a movie production for television broadcasting (using the same stage and scenography: here we do not have an operatic movie, but a movie reproducing a virtual, not live, theatre performance), that started at the end of 1954 theatre season, a few months before Furtwängler's death.<br />This DVD brings back to us that invaluable document, previously issued on videotape.<br /><br />Here we can actually get in touch with the achievement, at its best, of the idea of \\"recitar cantando\\".<br />All the stars involved in this wonderful performance act perfectly and accordingly sing. Obviously they all are top singers, so that the \\"mistery\\" of the incredible and persistent success of the basic and general concept of \\"melodramma\\" (in all its forms) is clearly and simply unveiled.<br />Acting while singing, in a environment moulded by music, is a more complete form of art than only acting or only singing. Paraphrasing Eugenio Montale, opera is the artistic form that more than any other aims at \\"the sublime\\", facing, impavid, the ridiculous. If music and lyrics are good enough, what allows to avoid the ridiculous and to achieve the sublime is involving acting along with masterful singing.<br />Therefore, here we do not meet tenors with senseless prominent thumbs or sopranos with menacing forefingers or salty statues moving their mouths. Here we see living characters, whose natural and best way of expressing their ideas, feelings, moods is singing. And what acting and singing cannot express is completed by the musical context.<br />Set design (scenography) is directly involved in the result. Characters have to move in an environment (not necessarily realistic) that allows their action to have a sense. The scenography (by Clemens Holzmeister) of this \\"Don Giovanni\\" is only apparently traditional; indeed, it is out of time and it hides its perfect blueprint in integrating what characters are acting and singing, discreetly providing them with support points when needed or perfect (that is, consistent with action, text and music timing) distance among objects when moving.<br />In the particular case, the stage had been set in the Felsenreitschule (old riding school) \\"in that supernatural décor which seems to have emerged by history - the stone archways (highly appropriate for Don Giovanni!) were hewn out of the sheer rock of the Monchberg in 1662\\" (J.P. Brechenmacher, Booklet accompanying CDs of Rodolphe Productions edition, 1988).<br />In this ideal environment, a superb direction (by Herbert Graf - stage - and Paul Czinner & Alfred Travers - movie and television -) completes the work, moving and affecting characters with an incredible and meaningful naturalness.<br />In some cases, gestures are of astonishing beauty, as while accompanying Don Ottavio's \\"lo giuro\\" to Donna Anna.<br /><br />Cesare Siepi (1923-2010), as usual, sings exceptionally well and, with rare mastery, tackles the problem of acting a Don Giovanni very agile and, at once, lordly; generally, quick moving is not  associated with a lordly posture, but, here, agility is necessary to give the sense of Don Giovanni's \\"hunting\\" instinct and pulse, decision, mental rapidity and flexibility, restlessness and intolerance for other people.<br />In his final scene, Siepi is simply astonishing in rendering Don Giovanni's actual anguish and consternation and, at the same time, his proud reaction to them trying to take the situation under control until the last painful breath: the gamble has to be backed till the end of the game, not to debase and destroy everything he had been before. Worth seeing!<br /><br />Donna Elvira, in this proper interpretation, still and deeply loves Don Giovanni, and, in spite of appearance, she is not looking for revenge, but she hopes someway to manage to save him.<br />Obviously she is a warm and sensual woman and she desires him back to her - also recovering her \\"honour\\": why not? -, but this is not the heart of the matter.<br />She is sincerely worried about his destiny and, figuratively, she may be regarded as the incarnation of an angel envied to offer him the last opportunity of redemption (not by chance, she appears after Don Giovanni's worst misdeed), but, at the same time, to prove that Don Giovanni has been allowed to make use of his free will. When, at dinner, he sarcastically rejects her, evidence is reached and, consequently, the Stone Guest appears for the final judgement.<br />A gorgeous Lisa Della Casa (b. 1919) was enrolled to play this difficult and troubled role, substituting Elizabeth Schwarzkopf (1915-2006), who, not convinced of the movie project, refused the part. Someway, this can be considered a good luck, in the sense that, in any case, we have the wonderful Schwarzkopf in Salzburg 1953 on CD, while Della Casa's figure, in my opinion, better suites to the Donna Elvira of our imagination.<br /><br />Donna Anna here dresses again her true noble personality. In too many recent versions she is depicted as a sort of cleaned out tramp, who actually and sexually desires Don Giovanni (or somebody else more sensual, fascinating or handsome of Don Ottavio), while pretending to love her suitor.<br />We do not have any elements to induce that Donna Anna feels attraction for Don Giovanni, but, in any case, this could be absolutely natural. Virtue does not consist in not feeling sensuality (that would be frigidity), but in dominating it aiming at higher values, a worthy motherhood for instance.<br />Neither the fact that not immediately she tells Ottavio what actually happened in that tragic night proves some false attitude, nor the fact that she defers the marriage can be ironically interpreted. Her beloved father has just been suddenly killed while defending her! Besides, she does betray Don Giovanni as her aggressor.<br />Elisabeth Grümmer (1911-1986) sings and plays this role astonishingly well. From an acting point of view, in my opinion, she is the most gifted and naturally posed of the cast.<br /><br />Anton Dermota (1910-1989) sings and plays very well what is wrongly considered the most thankless role of the drama (Don Ottavio). In my opinion, he is better in singing, with a flawless, smooth and well balanced vocal emission, but it is also true that he has to act mainly facing (and being compared with) Grümmer's superb expressiveness.<br />In any case, Don Ottavio here is not erroneously depicted as cowardly and shallow, but as a future tender husband, good father and exemplar citizen.<br /><br />What is wrong with this tender young couple? Why so many interpretations tends to deny their virtues? Why so often all spotlights are pointed on the fascinating Don Giovanni (or on his myth)?<br />Pay attention, there is a subtle pitfall! The expression \\"Dramma giocoso\\" here is used with the same intention Dante used the term \\"Commedia\\". \\"Dramma giocoso\\" is well suited to \\"Le Nozze di Figaro\\" or \\"Così Fan Tutte\\", where nothing of irreparable happens; on the contrary, in \\"Don Giovanni\\" supernatural forces are directly involved in the plot, two men tragically die, one of them is damned for eternity, Elvira renounces the world and goes to a definitive retreat.<br />Mozart loves sincerely this couple as much sincerely he thinks that Ottavio e Anna are a model of good feelings and virtues, of reciprocal respect, joined to tenderness, of use of shared laws against individual abuse and arrogance.<br />This is the same Mozart of Tamino and Pamina (the metaphysical perfect couple) and of \\"La Clemenza di Tito\\".<br />Mozart and Da Ponte make Don Giovanni fascinating, because evil is (apparently) fascinating. They depict Anna and Ottavio a bit \\"boring\\", because virtue is (apparently) a bit boring. They also propose a second class choice, less \\"boring\\" but less noble, Masetto and Zerlina (or Papageno and Papagena).<br />But, to the apparent leading role, Don Giovanni, they do not give a single real aria ... because he has nothing to express! He is completely empty.<br />On the contrary, Anna and Ottavio are given magnificent and noble arias and duets!<br /><br />Erna Berger, born in 1900 (d. 1990), in 1954 is a really too aged Zerlina for the stage, but her vocal timbre is still youthful and fresh. Besides, she is slightly build and her acting and singing are lively and vivacious, therefore reducing the problem.<br />In conclusion, her experience and supreme artistry avoid affecting too much in video what would be considered a top level performance on an audio recording.<br /><br />We are overwhelmed by socio-historical interpretations concerning \\"Le Nozze di Figaro\\".<br />In \\"Don Giovanni\\", Masetto goes far beyond Figaro's \\"Se vuol ballare ...\\" (or Cherubino's unaware insubordination); Masetto wants to teach a lesson to a nobleman directly threatening him (is he ready to kill him?).<br />But Figaro is a servant (or a factotum), while Masetto (if not a bourgeois) is not the last fellow of the village and he has an established social position (people is ready to follow him; he will marry \\"the beauty\\" of the village).<br />Masetto's behaviour is not completely credible in Don Giovanni's times, but in Mozart-Da Ponte's times (1787)... .<br />A young Walter Berry (1929-2000) is perfect suited to the role and he well expresses, vocally and acting, pride, spontaneity and self-confidence. Masetto and Zerlina are not \\"romantic\\" lovers: pleasure is important for both of them, but honour intended as reputation and standing (in Masetto) and social climbing (in Zerlina) are more important than love.<br />Differently from Ottavio and Anna, Masetto and Zerlina are at risk. Masetto is rightly fooled and punished when attempting to use evil means against evil; Zerlina is saved by Elvira, not by herself, when evil tempts her in her Ego's weaknesses (in that context,without Elvira intervention, her destiny would have been of dishonour, social rejecting and unworthiness for marriage and motherhood).<br />The Berry-Berger's couple renders perfectly this kind of conventional and \\"terrestrial\\" relationship.<br /><br />Otto Edelmann (1917-2003), with his rubber mask, is an exceptionally expressive and vivid Leporello.<br />He perfectly renders the mercenary character of the cynical servant and his ambiguity. Leporello's instability between his bad acting and his consciousness of ethical limits (\\"Ma Donn'Anna cosa ha voluto?\\") derives from his laziness and indolence, but he justifies them as a proper reaction to what he considers the inequity of his destiny (in what his master is better than him to deserve his privileges?) and not as the actual cause of his status.<br />Therefore, Leporello remains isolated on the border of the social fabric (we do not know if he is actually married or not).<br />Edelmann acts and sings very well, with the sole problem of an imperfect Italian pronunciation, or, better, the presence in it of typical German inflections.<br /><br />Dezsö Ernster (1898-1981), in 1954, already boasted a long and prestigious international career. In my opinion, here he and his voice look a bit tired. Singing is not profound and frightful enough to make you tremble or to give you, by itself, gooseflesh (in 1953 live version on CD, the \\"Commendatore\\" was a more threatening Raffaele Arié).<br />The problem seems to consists in a slight lack of breath to hold music slow pace.<br />It is a pity, because everything else in the most characterizing scenes of this opera is perfect and involving.<br /><br />But it is obvious that the main star here is Wilhelm Furtwängler (perfectly supported by Wiener Philharmoniker and Vienna State Opera Chorus).<br />The first shots of the movie show him conducting the overture.<br />As soon as he takes place on the podium, you perceive that something unforgettable is going to happen. You feelthat a sort of sacred rite is starting and you have the luck to have gained the entrance to it.<br />Furtwängler's general conception of music and conducting is clearly and quite completely expressed in his book \\"Concerning Music\\"; for people who agree with him, like I do, there is nothing to add here, if not the observation that this perforamance shows us the full and mature achievement of what abstractly discussed in the book.<br />The most evident peculiarity of his interpretation of \\"Don Giovanni\\" is the calm pacing of his conducting. But relatively moderato tempos do not mean neither improper slowness, nor lack of tension. On the contrary, tension here is constantly at its zenith. Your attention is always completely absorbed.<br />A relatively slower pace is what is needed to music, words and gestures to articulate in depth and in detail the complexity of (contrasting) moods and to allow you to become aware of what is actually and dynamically happening in characters' psyches and souls.<br />Exposition and understanding have to contemporarily occur \\"hic et nunc\\"; on the contrary, the celebration of the rite is meaningless and what is a life giving performance would become a mere narration.<br />Mismatched pre-conceived Freudian interpretations are out of place here. Neither every man secretly desire to be like Don Giovanni, nor every woman fall in love with him.<br />Furtwängler's attentive work manages to embroider, in front of your very eyes, a neat and coherent arras, avoiding to sew up unjustified preconceptions in an incongruent patchwork. Therefore, everything is collocated in its own right place.<br />Here orchestra and singers breath together, and their common breathing is the same one naturally flowing out from score and lyrics.<br /><br />Movie technicalities are obviously aged. Picture format is 4:3, colours are not particularly brilliant and sound is mono. There is some little problems of synchronization between voices and mouth movements. Sometimes cameras have problems with the depth of focus.<br />In my opinion, nothing of all that is able to affect a full enjoyment of such a masterful interpretation.<br />On the other side, we have to consider that, from a technical point of view, this movie, at that time, being not shot using a cinematographic set, was regarded as a great and successful achievement.<br /><br />J.P. Brechenmacher (above mentioned) pointed out that the 1953 edition was better than 1954 one, the latter being possibly affected by a sort of tiredness and drop of tension. I have no element to discuss the matter. The July 27, 1953, public performance is issued on CD and it is a live recording, while here we have a movie reproducing a particular kind of studio performance.<br />Conductor, orchestra, chorus and singers had to move in a strange context, working hard, often by night, for many hours; maybe some moment of tiredness here and there actually occurred, as, maybe, in the case of Ernster.<br /><br />Anyway, an unsurpassed masterpiece (five stars plus) had been achieved and this edition places it again within everybody's reach.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I have loved this book for years - it is full of strong female characters, and Bradley's use of the language is beautiful and eloquent.  For several years, I read this book every summer, and I always find something new to love about it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Like many others, I have been waiting for this to come out on Kindle Fire. I like this games for its fun... well, I cant really explain it. Anyway, look parents. This helps with hand eye coordination and kids enjoy it. I myself am 13 and enjoy this like many other kids at my school. Now, you may be wondering If you have to pay for special points. after you run out. I will tell you this: if you have to pay for something, you got the wrong game. In the game, you earn points by doing runs.<br />  Currently, the only thing wrong with the game is that you may get upset if you mess up often. That's all I can Think  of right now. I thinkcyou should getcthis game<br />And, if you don't like it, it is free! so it will be fine.<br />  -Eugene O.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I bought season 1 of the walking dead while I was on vacation. I got home the next day and it was at my front door, it was amazing how quick it came! The DVD set was in great shape, and brand new! I will only buy DVDs from Franks from now on!
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games adequately met the high expectations I had when I started the book.<br /><br />The Hunger Games deserves to be lauded for what it is; an exciting journey of a novel that transports its readers into the lives of Katniss Everdeen and the people of District 12.  The relative simplicity of the book--as a college student, I was able to blast through the book over a weekend with a full load of homework--does not take any shortcuts when it comes to thrills and suspense.  Collins never ends a chapter without a cliffhanger that keeps you always wanting more (which is actually annoying, because you can never find a good place to pause).<br /><br />The difficult aspect of the book for me was the sheer volume of sentence fragments that were used to describe the short, instinct-like thoughts running through Katniss' head.  I didn't notice it until I was reading a chapter vocally to my wife, and the choppy language was so bad that I couldn't read smoothly.  From then on, the style drove me nuts and unfortunately distracted from the great story.<br /><br />Having said that, I continued to read the whole trilogy and watched the movie, and Collins' universe is interesting all the way through.  The Hunger Games trilogy will probably never share a seat with The Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter at the table of all-time great young adult series, but certainly is noteworthy, and, of course, the flavor of the moment.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is definitely thrilling,  fun,  and above all things addicting!!! I have played it for some time on my iPod touch now, and now that its also available on my kindle fire, its a perfect set up. My highscore so far is 2,200,000. whoop whoop!!  :D
0743437497|5.0|Far and away my favorite Stephen King novel!  From beginning to end, the reader is able to watch the main character's condition gradually deteriorate, and feels a sense of anxiety for the safety of his wife and son.  The progression throughout the story goes perfectly.  King helps you feel the hopelessness of the family's situation, then repeatedly reveals glimmers of hope before stripping it away again.  Absolutely a psychological roller-coaster ride!<br /><br />The only complaint - the paperback version that I purchased gave an incredibly obvious hint on the back cover about how the novel would end.  I don't know why any publisher would spoil a book so terribly, but the book was still remarkable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game! my son got me hooked! just wish they would make it so you could buy acorns with your coins.
0451169514|3.0|Given that It is regarded as a classic Stephen King novel, and the amount that I enjoy most of his writing, I had very high expectations of this novel which were not met.  The book is incredibly long-winded; King spends at least 75% of the novel providing background and setting up the climax.  Around page 1000 I realized that absolutely nothing had really happened.  The ending of the novel was not worth reading the hundreds of pages beforehand.  Altogether the story was fine, but so drawn out that it was not as fun as The Shining or Salem's Lot for me.  There was never any point where It was a can't-put-it-down book.<br /><br />To give some justification for the long-winded story, King creates a beautiful setting and is a master of character development.  I truly knew the town of Derry and became acquainted with the characters.  If that is what you are looking for, great.  The descriptions contained within the first 200 pages would have adequately satisfied me.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I have read three of the four books and decided I would like to see the HBO version of this series.  I have watched about half of the season and it follows the book really well.... it's really interesting to see how HBO brings the characters and kingdoms to life.... I was especially pleased with the 'wall' and how much it matches my vision of it when reading the books.<br />Also the CD set is really nicely packaged.<br />I will be purchasing the subsequent seasons......
B005VPRET4|5.0|I got it for my 6 year old as a birthday gift. She has never played with LEGO before (she has never been in to the blocks). She loved every part of it: building the coffee shop (it is pretty easy to assemble), adding all accessories, playing with it. This product is high quality: description of assembly is easy for 6 year old to understand, all the pieces fit as they are supposed to, there is tons of cute accessories like utensils, milkshakes glasses, pots ect. The only complaint we have is about tarts (or cupcakes). They are plastic forms with unattached lego dots, so the dots fall out easily. they are so tiny that is really hard to find them. We may have to use some super glue;))). Overall we love this product!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I enjoy playing this game and often play it until I have to get something else done. It is easy to lose track of time when playing this game.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I'm not a die-hard Bee Gees fan, but this is one great concert. The video and audio quality are absolutely flawless. The audio mix is good, too. The drummer is isolated to ensure a good mix.<br /><br /> I've read many of the customer reviews, and I don't think anyone has mentioned the bonus features. My DVD could possibly be a deluxe edition. The front cover has a sticker attached that lists the extras. The boys sing a few songs from their appearance on \\"An Audience With The Bee Gees,\\" and an interview is also included.<br /><br /> But the MGM concert is the selling point. The renditions are studio-quality. The highlights for me are \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart,\\" and \\"I Started A Joke.\\"<br /><br /> Olivia Newton-John is in the front row. Barry introduces her from the stage and when \\"Grease\\" is performed, she gets a lot of camera time as she listens and watches the clips from the film.<br /><br /> This show is especially poignant due to the recent passing of Robin. Barry has outlived all three of his younger brothers.<br /><br />  If you don't have this one, grab it. You won't be disappointed.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|You guys that give this a bad review are crazy. This a really good game don't listen to the bad ratings.
B0086221SS|1.0|Simply just bad.  No direction, bad acting.  I will never get those two hours back.  Seth's acting is getting worse.  The actors looked uncomfortable with each other.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Fascinating!! I run home from work every day to read this book.  Even if you are not a techno geek you will love this book. It's inside peek at the wheeling & dealings of a company that has changed the very landscape of our lives. What a great read!
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Excellent blu-ray version. The picture on my 55\\" LED is sharp and crystal clear.  Comes with both the theatrical and special edition version (~15 min of additional material).  The disc did take a long time to load.

B000002O5L|5.0|As far as I'm concerned this classic is the best of Petty bar none!  Nothing like listening to the Heartbreakers on those long road trips cross country.  Not a few of these tracks were performed on their Super Bowl show which set the bar for that venue!  Thanks for some wonderful memories, Tom!  Hope to see you live one day.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|this is a great time wasting game. great graphics and looks great on my Kindle Fire. I wish this game was on the android market so I can play on my phone. To add to it this game really has been ticking me off lately because as soon as I get to level 40 the game just resets itself starting me over at level 1. I lose all my upgrades that I have gotten and half to start from scratch. Please fix the glitches on this game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think Temple Run is one of the most excellent games that I have played so far. I strongly recommend this game for somebody who likes a fast adventure game that thrills.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have enjoyed this game and it hasn't cost me one cent. I'm up to level 38 and have not needed to spend any money at all.  If I do touch the screen that prompts me to purchase coins or acorns I simply X out of it. I'm shocked that people seem surprised when they get a bill because it means you just aren't paying attention to either what you are doing or what your children are doing. No reason to trash the game because of user error.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Challenging and mentally stimulating game.  Thoroughly enjoying.  Unlike many other apps seems to have reasonable permission requirements.  Highly recommended, though not for very young kids (too hard)
B003L77G6A|5.0|I absolutely love love love The Big Bang Theory. It's witty and funny--quality humor for a comedy show. The dvd set came well packaged and all the dvds are in fine working order. I've already watched them all.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is a vast improvement on a Masterpiece trilogy.  The picture quality is phenomenal and the 5.1 digital surround sound makes it feel like you are in the scene.  If you like the otiginal, you will love what Coppola has done to restore the film to it's cinematic glory.  A must own for people who appreciate these 3 epic films.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game :) it runs reallly smoothly, I haven't noticed any glitchs, and there is nothing I would change!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I ordered this cover over 2 weeks ago for my new Kindle Fire, and I think it works really well.  It holds the Kindle in the case itself very snugly.  I have no fear whatsoever that it will come out of there unless I want it to.  The cover to the case has just enough protection without it being to hard to bend or being a danger to your screen, though the felt lining of the cover has already begun to fray a bit. I've dropped it once or twice, (not from any incredible height, maybe 2 feet or so) and it held up just fine, no freezing or anything.  Despite the case being sturdy it's really lightweight, and adds hardly anything to the weight of the kindle.  I ordered it in pink and think the color is lovely.  The strap is flexible and tight, holds the front of the case very well.  I actually use the strap when I'm reading, it helps me hold the kindle with one hand as well.  The stand has never given me any problems, and I've stood the device up on many surfaces already, from a table, to my bed, my lap, and an armrest in the car.<br /><br />All in all, I would describe it as \\"fine\\".  It gets the job done without wowing me.  I don't know that it was worth the 29.99, may be a tad overpriced by $5-10, but I'm not sorry I bought it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I spend almost all my spare time playing this game! I love it! Only negative is it makes my phone(htc evo 4g) reload everytime I play it
B00127RAJY|5.0|I will be 58 this year and I completely enjoyed this work out. It is great to switch the work out routines around to keep from getting bored.  Some of the steps I have not mastered so I do the modified version and keep moving.  I laugh every time Jillian says, \\" no rest you are only working out for 20 minutes, ok take 5 seconds\\" . I do not necessary need to shred any pounds but I do need to exercise - this is fast, fun and feels exactly the way you should after a good work out.  You want to shred ?  Get out the lead!!

0802473156|3.0|The advice given in the book was good and valid; however, it seemed to be only a subset that given in a much better marriage book, His Needs Her Needs, by Dr. Willard Harley --- a book which I fully credit for saving my own marriage.<br /><br />I've got to believe that Chapman borrowed from Harley in some concepts.  For example, the author uses the concept of the \\"love tank\\".  But I believe that Harley arrived first at the party with his concept of the \\"love BANK\\".<br /><br />Also, the readability of of The 5 Love Languages suffered somewhat by the author's overuse of quotation marks, i.e. presenting conversations between individuals, instead of speaking directly to the reader.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quick read, then 5 Love Languages is OK.  But if you're seriously trying to save your troubled marriage, His Needs Her Needs is the way to go.

B007XNTDPA|4.0|John Grisham makes you feel that the young Boone is what you were when you were growing up. The first books that I read when I was old enough to read were of young people the five series by Enid Blyton.Then I started reading Charles Dickins and Jules Verne.This young Boone is a boy you could follow in his travels through life just like Mark Twain and and his Huckleberry Finn and The Life on the Mississippi books.I look foreward to many more books on Theodore Boone. Thank you Mr.Grisham.

B00516ZWRE|4.0|im very happy with this album, while it doesn't the classic sound of crusader or denim and leather, it is one of the better albums from saxon in recent years. i compare it to unleash the beast and lionheart for reference, both albums i really like and i'm glad to see nigel glockler reunited with the group. all in all and awesome album from of the best british band around.
B00000099Y|5.0|Whole album is reminding me of Him, all those feelings this album puts you thru are feelings or experiences related to Bill Hicks..Im always wishing that he was alive to listen to this album.<br />This is a musical masterpeace only for that alone.<br />It grabs you from your most vulnurable (like Maynard says at one of their live show), puts you at your most vulnurable, and expects you to became Bill Hicks. whole album, musically does that so masterfully. In my opinion its not the one of the best, IT IS the best album on 90's. I'm 25 now and any young fellow should listen to this album as it is: a musical masterpiece. I'm suggesting this album almost to everybody even those who never ever enjoyed listening music and ppl responding me \\"It's something else\\".. this album has no limits. What music should be at its best.  [[ASIN:B00000099Y Aenima]]

As a former naval officer, it is great to see movies like this which promote the current heroes of our armed forces and the risks they take day in and day out to achieve objectives vital to the U.S.'s security. It is also heart-wrenching since I have friends of mine who have made the ultimate sacrifice and I am eternally grateful for the price they have paid in service to all of us.

B0083L22U4|4.0|Let's face it - there were a lot more ways this could go wrong than right.<br /><br />After hearing the wretched chorus for the title track (the first single), I was concerned that it would be more like the inane spiritual musings of Midge Ure's latter day solo work than the mid-80's Ultravox sound.  (NOTE: If you like the chorus for \\"Brilliant\\" or Ure's solo work since about 2003, this is probably a five-star record for you, and I'm sorry if I sound like I've insulted you.)<br /><br />Like Madness' excellent \\"The Liberty of Norton Folgate,\\" this is both entirely recognizable as the same band and a more measured, mature songwriting.  Not better than the mid-80's work, but also not trying to be the mid-80's work.  This is an extremely well-crafted pop record by veterans who know what they're doing.<br /><br />This is more \\"Love's Great Adventure\\" than \\"The Thin Wall\\" - it has the finely-tuned soaring, romantic arrangements, but leans toward their happier, more positive work.  I still find them to be at their best when they dabble in that keening darkness, like they do in \\"Lie\\", \\"Changes\\" and \\"Hello\\".  By the same token, this record only whiffs for me when they drift too far into Disney Channel territory, like \\"Brilliant\\" and \\"Rise.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, very few records don't clunk somewhere, but were I to make a friend an Ultravox mix tape (which would be AWESOME), a couple of these would make it.  Which is far better than I expected.

B00633W614|4.0|The exciting story begun in ONLY TIME WILL TELL continues as Harry Clifton is arrested for murder, a crime likely committed by the man whose identity he stole.  The chapters which follow Harry in prison are some of the most interesting in the book, perhaps because this is something Sir Jeffrey himself was familiar with.  The page-turning narrative readers have come to expect from Jeffrey Archer lives up to expectations as presumed death and presumed parentage continue to send rippling effects through the Clifton and Barrington families.  Emma Barrington emerges as a strong, determined woman intent on finding the father of her son Sebastian, Maisie Clifton finds happiness in an unlikely corner, and Giles Barrington surpasses all expectations.  Villains are laid low, heroes are exalted, and the reader will cheer this engrossing story until the final page when once again we are left dangling with the central mystery.  The third installment can't come soon enough for this reader!
B005KELWJY|5.0|This was a great product. The velvet interior is a nice touch, and I haven't found that the leather has any odor as other Kindle covers do. The $79 Kindle fits perfectly in the straps. I've used the cover regularly for the past 2 moths and have found no issues with the cover.

B005MW8CUG|5.0|As the title of the review says, this set is worth every penny you'll spend, especially if you are into hearing glimpses of an artist's creative process.  The second disc has several rehearsal and demo tracks where you really hear how the songs on Siamese Dream started out.  It's a pretty neat experience to listen to songs like \\"Today\\" and \\"Disarm\\" before all the music was completely written.  Also, the tracks on the second disc that did not make the cut for the album are truly awesome.  The song \\"Siamese Dream\\" will rock your socks off.  I actually listened to the second disc first and would recommend doing the same before listening to the remastered finished album.  It ends up being a really organic journey through the Smashing Pumpkins' creative process and you'll appreciate the album itself that much more.  As far as the remaster goes, it is phenomenal.  The differences in sound are subtle, but definitely noticeable.  You will hear guitar lines you didn't even know were there originally.  Finally, the live DVD I would consider very much a bonus piece of history.  The performance is extremely energetic.  The audio is very good.  The video production quality is not incredibly great.  I would say it appears as a high quality bootleg.  However, that actually seems extremely appropriate considering the subject matter.  This was a show at a small venue for a band that was about to explode in popularity and fame.  The generic quality of the video production only enhances your experience of feeling like a bit of a fly on the wall in the early 90s at a truly kick ass show.

6305095566|5.0|WARNING: SPOILERS<br /><br />First things first: this movie is insane. Between the brutal violence, some of the most disturbing imagery ever put to film (girl getting raped by a tree, anyone?), and mind-blowing camera work, this movie is a totally mad ride. And it's one darn awesome ride. This is one of the very few horror films that actually disturbed me. And that's something that I always like in a horror film. This film is friggin' freaky. Lets rate by category, shall we?<br /><br />1: Story: 9/10<br />  The story, while simple and kind of contrived, is very good simply because of the way that it is told. The story is simple: 5 college students go on vacation to an abandoned log cabin in the woods. While there, they discover a tape recorder that explains the book of the dead, and recites the passages. Turns out, that allows demons to posses the living, and all hell breaks loose. Eventually, only Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) left, and he destroys them by burning the book. This leads to our next subject.<br /><br />2: Special effects: 9.5/10<br />  Holy frikkin' crap. These are some of the best special effects of the 80's, especially when considering the extremely low budget. The ending where Ash burns the book of the dead leads to a beautifully disgusting array of stop motion animation, in which the demons/corpses rapidly decompose in a mess of blood, guts, maggots, and creamed corn. Yes, creamed corn. It's nasty, disgusting, revolting, and totally awesome. Very well done. As for the make-up effects, they are fantastic. They look a tad chalky compared to today's make-up effects, but they still look fantastic and grotesque, and will definitely stick with you for a while. The practical effects (blood, guts, and so on) look fantastic. The budget must have gone straight to the special effects, because they are really good and well done.<br /><br />3: Musical Score: 10/10<br />  The musical score, done by Joseph LoDuca, is perfect. Most of it is synthesized, and it fits quite nicely. The score adds to and fits perfectly with the scary and dark, yet fun and entertaining tone. It is perfect for this film.<br /><br />4: Acting: 9/10<br />  For the most part, the acting is pretty good for a movie of this genre/caliber, but there are times where the acting does feel forced, but this is only a minor complaint. The acting is quite good most of the time.<br /><br />Overall score: 10/10<br /><br />  This is by far the best horror film I have ever seen. Yes, there are some minor complaints, but the good far surpasses the bad. I wholly recommend watching this film, as well as the 2 sequels, Evil Dead 2, and Army Of Darkness. This film is, frankly, awesome. I definitely, wholly, and excruciatingly recommend this amazing film, as well as the totally awesome and 'groovy' sequels.

B007K3JCAE|1.0|I hope the message is loud and clear by the reviews ultraviolet is not a true digital copy. I don't want to have to be dependent on an internet connection for a \\"digital copy.\\" I really wanted to purchase this blu-ray but refuse to purchase due to ultraviolet replacing what should have been a true digital copy.
B007ZRZF8I|2.0|I thought this would be a good game, and it really looks good. The controls work and the character is cute. 2 stars. It might even be 3 with the ability to play with 4 people, but I admit I didn't test it long enough to really see that work.<br /><br />Before I realized there were in-app purchases (I admit the Amazon paragraph DID list them, I missed the info), my son had used up all of the shields and wanted to buy more. Fortunately, I had already set up my Fire to require a password and had taken off my credit card from the one-click so that my son could not simply reset the Fire to get around the password. (YES, it is possible and takes a bit of time to re-download all of the apps from the cloud.)<br />No stars for getting a paid app with in-app purchases.<br /><br />The file is also large. Since I'm playing on the Fire, I can't move it to an SD card, so I don't have a lot of space with it. I'm removing it from the Kindle, especially due to the problem below.<br /><br />I normally turn off wi-fi when I play games (or let my kids play games) on the Fire so that I can avoid seeing ads such as on Angry Birds. Once I saw there were in-app purchases, I turned off the wi-fi --- and then I got a message that Open Feint could not connnect. BEWARE! The developers did not even mention Open Feint. I thought this was another case of not reading the description, but, no it is not listed.<br /><br />So, overall, the game is cute, but it is taking up a lot of my available app space in order to be a front for getting money through the in-app purchases AND mining my data with Open Feint. It is being removed from my Fire.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|All these old songs-put me off at first glance, but after a listen I find Americana is brilliant! In 'Last Trip to Tulsa' on his first album Neil says, \\"I used to be a folk singer. . .\\" Well, he still is. The fact that I have known the words to most of these songs since I was a child makes the music even more fun.<br />Pete Seeger should be proud of Neil's return to, or rather reiteration of Folk. And it's got a beat you can dance to.
B005LLX582|1.0|We had heard this was a pro-life movie and were disgusted that it wasn't available in the stores.  We were also disappointed that it did poorly at the box office.<br /><br />HOWEVER, having spent more for the DVD than it would have cost to go to the theater, no big demand, so no price break, we wasted our money.<br /><br />I am not sure what this movie is for.  It moves so slowly that staying awake is a real effort.  When the movie ended, our reaction (mine and my wife's) was, \\"Huh?\\"<br /><br />This is a total dud and waste of money.

0545123275|5.0|This book really got me into wolves. I love the way it was written and the short chapters. It was basically an easy read. I feel like I just started and it is now finished.<br /><br />Grace was the girl who was bitten by the wolves but never turned. No one really knew why or how she was able to stay human. Despite the failed transformation, she retained some wolf traits such as sensitive smell and hearing. She was also drawn to the woods and the wolves in them ever since. Especially one in particular: the wolf with the yellow eyes.<br /><br />I really can't picture an animal or a human with yellow eyes, but that was Sam. He was only human during the spring and summer seasons and then he turned into a wolf when it got colder. The winter months were the wolf months. During those times, all he could do was watch Grace from the edge of the woods, filled with longing.<br /><br />When they finally had time to be together, it was so beautiful and wonderful. They were so in love. It would have been unrealistic but the way the author wrote it, it just made sense. They both fought to keep Sam in human form until the very end.<br /><br />This book is absolutely amazing, I would really recommend reading it.

B0086700CM|5.0|great game fun and entertaining a little frustrating when the man starts running very fast since you have to be more careful but otherwise good
B000MD7OKY|1.0|Sorry but I thought this was irritating. After 30 min I quit watching it. I dont understand why they dubbed scenes in the movies back then. The scene where he is in the office of the restaurant with his friend got on my nerves and I quit watching it shortly after. In the scene the friend is standing up at his desk. Leans over towards a drawer and grabs a box. He says to Grant, \\"here I have something for you\\". And he puts a box on the table. But when he said \\"here I have something for you\\" his lips never moved. He didn't say anything! Then when he was on the boat with the woman from the restaurant, some things she said were not matching to what you were hearing. Sorry but an English language film should not have badly dubbed English!

B007U1FEJE|5.0|Given the torpor of their most recent group recordings, the news of a 50th anniversary Beach Boys reunion album brought with it nightmarish expectations of a shadow of their former selves pity release propped up only by nostalgia and sympathy. Well, whatever god made their radio must be a celestial surfer at heart since That's Why God Made The Radio is a stunningly beautiful record that offers a meticulously crafted twelve song homage to their beloved Southern California that has fully tapped into the amber of their signature harmonies and fused it with their most inspired composition and production this side of Holland and Surf's Up.<br /><br />Instead of populating the record with a Hamburger Helper hodgepodge of warmed over covers and throwaway solo tracks - all cobbled together under the fraying Beach Boys brand - Radio is an authentic group effort that accentuates the soundscape mastery of Brian Wilson while smartly relegating Mike Love's annoying preference for Hawaiian shirted \\"Admiral Sunscreen\\" self-parody to the safety of an \\"executive producer\\" purgatory. Brian is in full control and it shows as he deftly imports the majority of his SMILE touring band, including the incomparable Jeff Foskett, to augment the proceedings.<br /><br />Although I harbor none of the gauzy notions held by some fans that at fifty years in the Beach Boys have summoned all of their experience and talent to create their best record however, given what it could have been, it is much more than an unexpected pleasure. It is sublime. From the plaintive opening chords of Think About The Days to the soft harmonic fade of Brain's chilling Summer's Gone, Radio is an exquisite swan song from a group that has smashed its way back from antiquity to relevance. An essential recording.

0345803485|5.0|When asked about this book there are two responses.  They are either \\"I absolutely loved it\\" or \\"I absolutely hated it\\".  The question is, which category do you fall into?  It really is that black and white, there is no grey (pun intended).<br /><br />Which category did I fall into?  I absolutely, positively loved and adored this book. My emotions completely ran the gambit while reading it.  I laughed, gasped, smiled (many times) and even cried.<br /><br />So why is it so black and white with [[ASIN:B007J4T2G8 Fifty Shades of Grey]]?  The negative reviews seem mention the writing style of E.L. James.  Honestly this did not seem to phase me at all, I even went into the book with this thought in my mind.  Yes there are repetitive moments and I do believe Ana says 'Oh My...' a few too many times but then at the end of the day it didn't really bother me all that much.  As this book is being told by Ana and we can all admit she is a very naive, innocent girl, I felt the style of writing was actually how Ana would be speaking and thinking in her head.  I have never known myself to say 'Oh My...' but when I think of the situations that she found herself in I could see how this is a thought that would be in her head.  So again, I was not at all phased by the writing or the style, I found it very easy to read and it flowed nicely.<br /><br />Are the characters believable?  In the world they have been written into... yes.  Is it all that believable in the 'real world'... probably not. This is a work of fiction and therefore you are allowed to enter it's world and forget about your own for a little while.<br /><br />Does this book have sex? Of course it does, you probably wouldn't be reading this review if you didn't already know that.  Is this book only about sex? Absolutely not.  This is a love story.  A love story between a shy, self conscious girl and a broken, messed up boy.  But I have faith they will help each other as the story progresses and that they will be happy.  Am I a hopeless romantic? Yes Sir I am!<br /><br />What can I say about the main characters... Christian and Anastasia (Ana)? I love them. It is that simple for me. I love them. I love how they interact with each other and found the eMails back and forth very funny. I love how one moment there is giggling and happiness and then the next it is all moody and thoughtful. I love how you can see them both growing together, helping each other and I want nothing more than for them to ride off into the sunset together. Isn't it every girls dream to have a knight in shining armor come to whisk her away upon a gallant white horse? Of course it is. However, the part the camera never focuses in on is the fact that the knight has a leather riding crop in his hand.Am I a hopeless romantic? Yes Sir I am!<br /><br />What can I say about the main characters... Christian and Anastasia (Ana)? I love them. It is that simple for me. I love them. I love how they interact with each other and found the eMails back and forth very funny. I love how one moment there is giggling and happiness and then the next it is all moody and thoughtful. I love how you can see them both growing together, helping each other and I want nothing more than for them to ride off into the sunset together.

0143121006|4.0|This book has everything going for it. A twisting plot, turbulent historical background, riveting details of an underworld long gone and seldom mentioned, a mix of British pride, depravity, sex, decadence, debauchery, personal tragedy, corruption and diplomatic machinations. It offers a fascinating and very rare glimpse into the lives of ordinary, less privileged foreigners in Beijing in the 1930s. It is hard to believe that the book is not a work of fiction, that all characters and events are real. By a stroke of incredible luck, the places, the streets that the main characters walked still remain and are possible to explore, which I intend to as I suspect their days may be already numbered.<br /><br />The story is nicely spun and runs quite smoothly, apart from occasional repetitions, which aren't too jarring. It clearly demonstrates the amount of research and effort that went into the reconstruction characters faithfully and with some depth, despite the scarcity of materials.<br />This is a must read for anyone with interest in the Beijing of early 20th century.

I've never read the book that people keeps saying this movie was based on.

0140277447|5.0|I always wondered why there was so much tension and anamosity between these people. The book was very informative by explaining some of the history involving China and Japan.It was very detailed without losing you along the way.The book also shines a light on the U.S. and how we once again end up embracing and accepting some very questionable characters. Great book! But very sad.
0345803485|1.0|I like erotica as much as the next person, but this was terrible. I was so annoyed at this book that I couldn't bring myself to masturbate. What does that tell you?<br /><br />Our heroine, Anastasia, has endless, repetitive internal dialogues, not just with her subconscious, but also with her inner goddess. Yes, instead of talking to the man with whom she's involved, she's always talking to those two. Now, I get that she is a virgin and has never had a boyfriend, but she is astoundingly, unbelievably naive for someone who is fond of British literature, is alive in 2011, has seen movies, TV shows, listened to popular music, and has attended and graduated from college. And to be so out of touch with how attractive she is? I realize she is female and loads of women, even the most beautiful, seem to have self esteem issues, but COME ON. One of her closest friends has indicated for years that he is into her, the son of her employer has indicated for years that he is into her, hell, even her best friend/roommate's brother seems to be into her, yet she has absolutely NO CLUE how attractive she is. Please.<br /><br />And I'll try not to dwell too much on how poorly written this book is, but AUGH! I'll just point out a few of the things that drove me out of my mind. For one thing, I defy you to quirk one lip. It isn't possible. Except, apparently, for Christian Grey. Also, what was up with the constant back and forth between Christian and Anastasia, \\"Are you smirking at me?\\" If someone's smirking at you, it's OBVIOUS. There they are, smirking at you. No need to ask, and no need to belabor the point with repeated, boring dialogue masquerading as \\"banter\\". Also, the constant use of \\"quirk up\\". Given the conversations during which the quirking up of the lips is happening, it's obvious the lips would be quirking up. So, really, \\"his lips quirked\\" would be sufficient, but why not mix it up a bit with some other terminology? About 21 pages into it, I found myself wishing I had a correction pencil, or tape flags, but it wasn't worth it.<br /><br />The emails between the two characters drove me almost as crazy as their face to face dialogue.<br /><br />I had to force myself to finish the last 200 pages, as my gluttony for punishment was apparently nearly tapped out. As soon as I finished, I called my best friend and said, \\"That book was TERRIBLE.\\"<br /><br />I feel kind of bad trashing on it because it can't be easy to write a book, but E.L. James is laughing all the way to the bank, so the joke's on me. My friend said that she wanted to buy me a correction pencil just to see me go through and edit the book (and editing was BADLY needed), and I said, \\"Then I'd have to read it again.\\" I told her, \\"It was torture, and not in a good way.\\"

B000F3T3E6|5.0|Coming upon works unfamiliar in the repertoire is usually (and in this case very much) a pleasure.  Admittedly this listener bought this recording because it is one of the few opportunities to hear the beauty of Slovakian tenor Pavol Breslik's voice. He just completed a run of performances in the LA Phil production of Don Giovanni and his vocal talent displayed in his interpretation of Don Ottavio was one of the many highlights of the performances.  His is a rich, subtly ranging tenor that soars on command but is also able to travel the trills and filigree of Baroque opera.<br /><br />This recording is a very strong one, though the work itself is a bit strange/naïve. Simply stated, `Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno' (`The Triumph of Time and Truth') is an oratorio by George Frideric Handel produced in three different versions across 50 years of his career. This is Handel's very first oratorio, to a libretto by Cardinal Benedetto Pamphili and with a title that translates as \\"The Triumph of Time and Dis-illusion\\". The work concerns the intricate relations between four abstract characters: Tempo or Time (Pavol Breslik) and Disinganno or Enlightenment (Sonia Prina), and their offspring, Piacere orPleasure (Ann Hallenberg) and Bellezza or Beauty (Natalie Dessay). Emmanuelle Haïm conducts Le Concert d'Astree.  Each of the soloists is of the first rank and the collaboration with Haïm makes this early Handel work a most memorable one.  Hopefully there will be more performances of the Oratorio cum Cantata cum Opera after the public spends time with this recording. It is a delight!  Grady Harp, June 12

B0059XTUB8|5.0|I remember when I was in Hollywood a few years ago and was on the Walk of Fame.  Out of all of the stars, the one that I saw the most people taking pictures of and literally laying next to on the (dirty) street was Marilyn Monroe.  It was actually quite astonishing that after all of these years Marilyn Monroe still captures the psyche of people.  She is the quintessential icon of classic Hollywood and the epitome of a timeless sex symbol.  At times I feel that the idea and persona of Marilyn Monroe is actually more alluring than her movies.<br /><br />When I watched \\"My Week with Marilyn\\" I wasn't sure what to expect.  I knew it was critically acclaimed and Michelle Williams was nominated for an Academy Award.  However, in this day and age (at least to me) accolades and praise from the critics do not really hold a lot of water.<br /><br />I have to say that this movie is really a breathe of fresh air.  It is different from a lot of the same cookie cutter movies coming out today.  The film is based on the memoir(s) by Colin Clark about his personal experience with Marilyn Monroe while she filmed \\"The Prince & the Showgirl\\" in London.  During the production of this film Clark and Monroe developed a kinship and a semi-romantic relationship...at least according to Clark's accounts.  In addition, the movie also displays the production and grapples of filming \\"The Prince & the Showgirl\\" and at about 98 minutes not a moment is wasted.<br /><br />I found the acting in this movie to be superb.  Michelle Williams really did an amazing job in her portrayal of Monroe; right down to mannerisms, delivery of dialogue and appearance.  I must be honest; there were some scenes where Michelle Williams was a dead ringer (the cover of the DVD for instance) for Marilyn Monroe and other scenes where she looked nothing like her.  I realize this might be nitpicking, but I feel it should be noted.  Regardless, this takes nothing away from Williams' performance.  Actually, I have more respect for her as an actress after this movie; she even sang all of the songs. Kenneth Branagh was amazing (as always) as Laurence Olivier and Eddie Redmayne as Colin Clark was also wonderful.  I have a hard time believing this is the same Redmayne from the film \\"Black Death\\"!  Also look for good supporting roles from Judi Dench, Julia Ormond and Emma Watson.<br /><br />There have been so many \\"stories\\" about Marilyn Monroe that don't paint her in a positive light, this movie manages to show a very multi-leveled depiction of her.  The movie itself plays out like a comedy-drama and is able to be both innocent and melancholy.  The film does a wonderful job of detaining 1956 and showing an era that is long gone.  The score is also beautiful and haunting.<br /><br />I have heard some people condemned Clark's accounts with Monroe finding it dubious, stating that it was fabricated and fluffed up.  I don't know if that is true or not, I wasn't there.  Regardless truth or embellished, it is a great story and for that fact a wonderful movie.  I can definitely see myself revisiting this motion picture in the future.  I recommend this movie to anyone who truly enjoys the \\"art of cinema\\".for her as an actress after this movie; she even sang all of the songs.

B005974CNA|4.0|Dream Theater's latest opus is the first to be released since the departure of founding drummer Mike Portnoy.  Filling the drum stool this time around is Mike Mangini (formerly of Extreme and Steve Vai), who won a drum audition contest held by the band.  Mangini has a slightly different style to Portnoy, but overall there is not a lot of impact on the overall sound of the band.  This album is pretty typical Dream Theater fare with long rocking epics, great instrumental chops, and shorter ballads.  Jordan Rudess is particularly impressive on this release and his keyboard parts are some of the best he has done in his career with the band.  James Labrie also puts in a fine performance keeping emphasis on his straight ahead singing as opposed to some of the more oddball stuff he has experimented with on later day albums.  I used to think that Labrie was the weak link in the band, but he has really come a long way over the years.  Overall I think this is another strong Dream Theater album.  Probably not their best, but these guys always put out high quality music and \\"Turn Of Events\\" is no exception.

B005LAIHSG|3.0|This fairy tale film follows the basic plot points of the Grimm's Brothers' classic tale while preserving and even deepening the dark tone and fleshing out the flat, stock characters. These efforts vary in level of success, so I will start with the aspects I felt were successful.  The original tale is already pretty dark by itself with the evil queen wanting to cannibalize Snow White, but the film pushes the boundaries even more than I expected. The Evil Queen is the most evil and sadistic than I have ever seen in a fairy tale film. She gleefully sucks the youth and beauty out of random townspeople to fuel her magic and keep herself looking flawless. Her ability to kill with a touch and create construct soldiers make of glass and rock give a sense of real danger to the tale. It doesn't come as a surprise that a large group of women gather their daughters to live in a town far away and scar their faces to avoid the queen's attention and need to destroy beauty. For a PG-13 fairy tale film, I was very impressed that the dark tone of the Grimm tale was preserved and even made darker than their version of the tale.<br /><br />Everything visual about the film was amazing. The setting and the special effects were phenomenal, especially the glass/metal constructs the queen makes. The CGI or makeup (I'm not sure which) that was used to age Charlize Theron's face was incredibly realistic. She went from young to old throughout the film in varying degrees in relation to how much magic she used and how many people she drained of youth and health. My favorite visual aspect was the costumes. Ravenna had about as many costume changes as Lady Gaga as she had different dress for almost every scene. The inclusion of bones was genius on her clothing as well as her metal claws and spiky crowns. There is no denying that this is a really pretty film.<br /><br />I loved the Evil Queen, Ravenna. Instead of a mindlessly evil, two dimensional character, we got a deliciously evil queen with atragic past and awesome magical powers. She vehemently hates men because in her experience they use and discard women when they are no longer useful or beautiful. This mentality creates her obsession to stay young and beautiful to keep her powers. Ravenna is by far the most interesting and magnetic character in the film. I can't help but feel some sympathy for her even as she eats raven organs and sucks the youth and health from people while sadistically looking into their eyes as she does it. I wish the whole film would have been about her her life from penniless orphan leading up to becoming the evil sorceress queen that conquers kingdom after kingdom. Charlize Theron did an excellent job capturing Ravenna's wide range of emotion and making her the most memorable character in this retelling.<br /><br />The two things that really brought the film down for me were Kristen Stewart and the masses of unnecessary background characters. Kirsten Stewart's version of acting is grabbing her hair, sighing, hyperventilating, and leaving her mouth vacantly open for about 90% of the film. She has about 3 facial expressions and acts just as she does in Twilight and, from what I have seen, as she does in real life. Her character is only slightly better than Bella because the writing behind the film is better.The only nice thing I can say is that her natural hazel eye color looks much better than the brown contacts she had to wear in the Twilight films. In addition to a main character I cared literally nothing for, there were way too many minor characters. The Huntsman was fine and necessary, but Christ Hemsworth is a good actor and he was given very little to do. Snow's childhood friend Will was not needed at all. The love triangle had barely any actual romance and the two male characters could have been made into one. The dwarves were pretty useless as well, although generally enjoyable. They just seemed to eat up screen time while Snow meandered about until the final battle. The film needed a lot of streamlining both in the plot and in the characters.<br /><br />Overall, I would say Snow White and the Huntsman is an enjoyable summer movie. It's definitely not perfect and could have used a lot of improvement, but it's a small step in the right direction for fairy tale films. If nothing else, go see if for Charlize Theron, the dark tone, and the beautiful visuals.

Every recipe I have made has been a huge hit with everyone, and I love the photography and Isa's fun conversational descriptions and advice. I do wish, though, that the recipes relied less heavily on refined ingredients like all-purpose flour. I'm not a vegan but often cook dairy-free recipes, but I'm particularly keen to avoid white sugar and flour. There are some healthier options in here, but I would LOVE to see Isa come up with a baking cookbook that was more geared toward nutrition than fun and kitsch (as I adore her fun, and kitsch ;)...)

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Gross, gross, gross....I had no idea what this series of books was at all, but my 19 year old daughter loved them so I thought I would see what the buzz was about.  She did warn me that it was \\"mommie porn\\", but that she skipped those parts. So, now I have a question....how in the heck could you read enough of the books to get anything out of them if you skip \\"those parts\\" because the books are made up of nothing but \\"those parts\\"?  I mean, have read my fair share of romantic, sexy novels, but this was nothing even close to being enjoyable to me. Ugh! The only word that keeps coming to mind is yuck!<br /><br />PS - I really gave my 19 year old daughter my exact thoughts on these books (we only have the first two) and told her exactly what I thought about her reading them!!  She has yet to ask me to purchase the third book. Wonder why?

0393088774|5.0|Everyone takes a heaping helping of blame from Paul Krugman, most of all other economists, who have long since abandoned their industry's core value of preventing recessions and depressions in favor of inflating bubbles and riding waves of self-serving rhetoric.  The prescription for solving the current dilemma is almost too easy, but the problem isn't the economy, its the lack of political will to admit when policies are failing.
0345803485|1.0|I read about 70 pages of this book before I had to put it down and stop reading it. Did someone basically compile a bunch of stories from Cosmopolitan and write them into a novel? Or maybe they were busy surfing on fanfiction.net, changed the names of \\"Edward\\" and \\"Bella\\" to \\"Christian\\" and \\"Ana\\"? This reads like a bad fanfiction written by a teenager, or someone who knows very little about sex. Seriously, you can twist one of Ana's nipples and she'll come, just like that. Yeah, like that happens. It makes me upset that this book was written by a woman- she's basically lives in the world that all pornographers live in- one in which women can orgasm at the drop of a hat and where all women believe that giving oral sex is our greatest pleasure in the world.<br /><br />It's terrible. I can't believe it's a best seller. Seriously, you can find porn on the internet with a better storyline than this. In fact, you can find plenty of free porn on the internet that has no storyline, because in pornography, storyline is pretty much irrelevant. Perhaps this author should have skipped the boring and poorly written story crap in between the freaky sex scenes. It would have made this intolerable book slightly better.

I was skeptical whether the stage production would translate well on to the big screen but the fast pace, coupled with better-than-expected singing and dancing by Jones and Zellwiger, make<br />for an entertaining 90 minutes. The casting of Gere  as  lawyer Flynn was a mistake but his less than stellar performance does not prevent the show from being thoroughly effervescent and fun.

B0060AY85C|4.0|A lot of terrifying things happen in the first few pages of Home. Two young siblings out in a field at night see beautiful horses and the hasty burial of a black man. He is being tossed from a wheel barrel by hooded men, the same men who are forcing families from neighborhoods as well.  These sad beginnings were just a prelude to what Frank Money and his sister Cee would experience later in life.<br /><br />Their parents worked long hours in the cotton fields and died an early death. Abused by grandparents, Frank was protective of his younger sister Cee, but when Frank left for the Army to fight in the Korean war, Cee took off with the first man who paid any attention too her, and neither plan worked out well for the siblings.<br /><br />When Frank is released from the Korean war, he's a broken man, having witnessed his friends being killed in battle. While his girlfriend tries to ease his emotional pain, she's unsuccessful.  Home, is mostly a story about Frank, and what life was like in the early 1950's for a black, unemployed man, reentering society after the war.  It's only after a desperate letter arrives telling Frank he must go back to Georgia to save his sister, that Frank finds a chance to save himself as well.<br /><br />Home is short novella, fewer than 200 pages, but like Morrison's other novels, it packs a punch.  Although I read this book a month ago and thought it was very good, I had a hard time writing about it until now. Yes, it's a sad story, and the first person narration made it even sadder at times. As always Morrison's writing is beautiful, contemplative and memorable, but the story itself wasn't quite as deep as some of her earlier works -- still highly recommended though.

1594203334|3.0|I thought this book was a fun read.  It was interesting to read about her experiences as an American raising a family in France.  I think it would have been more of a fun book if it was more lighthearted or turned into a fiction.<br /><br />What really bothered me was the over generalizations on everything.  The whole book sounded to me like, ALL American parents/children are this way, while in France they are ALL this way (and by the way, the French do this much better than we do).  Not all American moms hate daycare, feed their kids only white food, and refuse to take any alone time.<br /><br />As a parent herself I would think she would know better than to over simplify raising children and being a mother with just saying that we would all be happier and skinnier if we did exactly what these women did.<br /><br />If you are going to read it, I would just suggest to not take anything she says too seriously.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|game is fun and entertaining.... only complaint is energy refilled too slow.  graphics good.  could easily play for hours if energy renewed faster...
B007ZXK08C|5.0|this is book for people who love to read.  i dont mean a nice packaged story i mean really read.  you cant skim pages and the plot unfolds and unfolds and unfolds... you have no favourites - no heroines - no heroes - you just have a gripping, interesting, surprising and at times darkly funny read.  it is very \\"wordy\\" with great descriptions and intricate plots that weave themselves along.<br /><br />ive read dark places and also thoroughly enjoyed it. i was expecting this to be in a similar vein but its very fresh and new and a different kind of plot... its a modern day war of the roses with serious psychological warfare and the portrayal of the characters was brilliant. This must have taken a very long time to put together - with all the nuances and plots within plots nothing was forgotten, everything tied together eventually - she didnt miss a trick.<br /><br />gillian you are just what the market needs right now.. so many authors are churning out these neatly packaged one or two twists books that you sometimes feel you are reading the same story with the names and places changed and I feel patronised by the fact that many feel like an ABC of crime writing.  Gone Girl made me feel like the author really respects the minds of  her readers and gives a book worthy of our money and our time and i for one will be waiting very impatiently for her next book.<br />Thank you for a brilliant story.. i loved it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app and that it allows me to read just enough to stay rooted in the word daily. I also love that it sends reminders to read just in case you miss morning devotion.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great storyline!! Its not what people think when they think of the book, yes it is sexual but the storyline outways all that.  Its a good read.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|this is one of the best games I have played. this is a good app for the kindle fire.  I love it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book and the two others are a must read, however I must warn you. Once you begin reading you can't put them down. They are great read during vacation on the beach. These books will consume you until you finish all three.
B00884GR0W|3.0|I really liked the game but when I updated it, it had made it the lite version which had made me angry.  I f u buy the game do not update it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am an avid reader, who has a \\"book\\" or kindle attached to my hands at every chance I get. I started reading this book after a long debate (with myself) and friends who have raved about it.<br />I will say I am not CRAZY about this storyline. It is very, very repetitive in every aspect. The writing is so-so, in my opinion. I think some of the YA writers have a better sense of direction and writing style than the author of this book does.<br />I have read a lot of books in my day and can usually finish a book, that I am engrossed with, within a day or two. I am having trouble putting this down, as I want to see (read) what other craziness \\"Christian\\" has \\"Ana\\" engage in.<br />I feel like it's one of these books that doesn't necessarily GRAB your attention, but it's one of those books that leaves you wondering what the author was thinking as they sat and wrote this.<br />I still can't believe it's a BESTSELLER....but I assume people are like me and buy out of curiosity!
B00127RAJY|4.0|In the first week I lost at least and inch on my legs and hips and .5 on my arms.  It works but after that first week i got bored with it even if i switched to the other work outs.  I have been on and off using the dvd ever since.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so in love with this game I take my kindle fire everywhere so I can play this awesome game
B002KKCWP4|5.0|I can be incredibly cheap at times the truth be known, and I agonized over whether I should spend $56 on a pair of lousy sandals....  After all: I'm \\"old school\\" and always associated sandals as being cheap affairs...  After all; what moron would spend over $50 for sandals ???<br /><br />One more case where you get what you pay for I suppose, so I again had to 'eat crow' as the old saying goes...  (at my age, one has had many serving of \\"crow\\", come to think of it)...<br /><br />I tried wearing cheap \\"$1.99 flip flops\\" before, but they would never stay on and could never get used to any footwear flip flopping about where you had to use conscious force to coax them to stay on.  After only a few hours of that uncomfortable grief, I gave up and trashed them...<br /><br />But when I saw this design, it seemed clear: Now this is how I would design a sandal !<br /><br />I've only been wearing them for an hour now, so I have no idea how they will hold up over time, but that aside; I'm not disappointed !  They offer excellent arch support, are well cushioned and are very comfortable even new out of the box...  No \\"flip-flopping\\" here !<br /><br />Bottom line: Gotta admit: they are worth every penny...
B00802JMPO|5.0|I ordered this book over the weekend and had it on my door step with regular shipping by the next Tuesday! Very happy and pleased I will try to look for this company each time I order books!

0985081821|4.0|**slight spoilers**<br />I bought this book on a whim because it looked sort of interesting and the cover art seemed pretty neat! It was only 2.99 for my Kindle so what the heck. I would like to give it 5 stars but there were a few small details in the story that somehow seemed unoriginal. There seemed to be a bit that reminded me somewhat of Twilight (which wasn't all that great to me, but not awful) such as the Council seemed to resemble the Volturi. Even the queen was like a Dakota Fanning (Jane), around the same age, and even same features. Valeria reminded me of Esme, Charles a bit of Edward but not so much. It was sort of the whole forbidden love thing, too. BUT, the overall plot was original to me, and by the end of the story I realized that no, it was not at all headed in that same direction. It won me over completely by the end, ready to read what's going to happen next in Sophia's life. I actually liked the characters and all of them were pretty developed, mostly the main characters. I would've liked to see a little more development of Charles because I still don't have a firm grip on his personality but I think we'll find out more about him throughout the series. The writing was good, interesting, and didn't drag things out. It may have been a little \\"slow\\" in the beginning, but it wasn't uninteresting at all. The further I got into the book the more I couldn't put it down. The more I wanted to read it when I wasn't reading it. I really loved this book and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes anything paranormal. Being a guy, I found Sophia's sexual frustration a bit awkward at time, but hey, it was from a girl's point of view and it was realistic. Anyway, I think I'm rambling. BUY THIS BOOK!
B007N85ZXY|5.0|I was going to begin this review by warning everyone to not start out by looking at the four videos that were released a week before this music. After seeing how he took old black-and-white silent movies and added them to this music for hilarious effect, I figured that I could not listen to this CD without laughing. Well, I haven't seen the remaining videos, and this whole record puts a ridiculous smirk on my face when listening to it. It is quite obvious that Neil intended this one to be a joke, and for those of you who took this one seriously, it looks like the joke is on you. I personally love all of this foolishness and the playing that makes them all sound loaded without really getting there (hence the title of this review). I can see this one as being a great party record, or to bring back memories of how some of us used to be able to party. Neil is a genious! I will take this one over electirc Lincolns any day.<br /><br />For those of you who hate this one, imagine if he had done it mostly acoustic with super-polished production and maybe even some strings. Or maybe re-do these songs in a style that is as close to the originals as possible? My point is, he knew that if he made this a serious record, then he would catch all kinds of bad reviews, so his best choice was to make a rough-edged electric joke. After all, the very essence of these songs are mostly about rough edges, with nothing pretty. Thankfully, Neil has kept his twisted sense of humor through all these years, and wisely added it to this one.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|If you are looking for a book to carry to the beach this summer to read while you watch over the children, this is not it! You will get SO engrossed and involved in this book, you will lose all sense of time and probably let your children drown! I started this book knowing I had company coming for the weekend, and found myself reading while hiding out in the bathroom, and sitting up late at night with a booklight, because I literally did not want to put it down.<br />This was recommended by several folks at my bookclub, but I was a little hesitant about getting into a legal thriller type of book. Boy, am I glad I did! It is as much a family saga as the legal part. It hooks you in the beginning and then the author slowly and methodically reels you in. It is about an Asst District Attorney whose only child, age fourteen, is accused of murdering a classmate. It gets inside everyone's head as you experience the mind of a father (and mother) who love and believe in their son, and while at the same time try to unravel the mess he is in.<br />Try this one, but don't make any plans around that time, because all you are going to want to do is curl up in bathrobe and PJ's and read. Best one I've read this year.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it ilia so addicting I could play it all day you must get it you wont regret it :)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love it. it reminds me of a game with an Italian plumber that had to collect coins and save a princess
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, I went to see it about one week ago.  I knew it was a musical and that Tom Cruise was a lead in the film.  Not knowing what to expect he really did a great job in this one.  The cast has a great time with some 80's and 90's hits.  Very well done!!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I've watched this movie every chance I get.  It's a classic much like Forrest Gump.  So Much symbolism, depth, and meaning.  Great family movie!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Mumford and Sons what else is there to say....Great music for every occasion...will be purchasing the other albums just based on the quality and relistenability
B007N85ZXY|5.0|This, album, the sound, the voices, the experience is Pure Americana. The selection of songs and the renditions are richly textured homespun Americana at its best. This album is quite a surprise and it will be an endearing one in time.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the most addicting game ever and if u think angry birds or draw something is good temple run is amazing
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Totally Awesome! I have been waiting for this album for some time. They finally released it. I love it. I was not disappointed! It is more than I ever imagined!<br /><br />It is haunting, nostalgic and just beautiful. It brings tears to my eyes. I don't know how to describe it. The sound and the voices are there. It's like a trip back in time, yet more endearing and heartfelt than I could ever have imagined.<br /><br />You really have to hear \\"Think About the Days\\" because it just says it all. It really is haunting. I closed my eyes and I was back where I have always wanted to be.<br /><br />I am thankful.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is amazing. I could play it forever. I was so glad it finally came for the kindle fire
B00846REIS|4.0|I bought this book because readers were comparing it to Fift Shades, which I liked. Glad i did. Not going to rehash the plot but like this book and will definitely read the next one. Eva and Gideon have a volatile and explosive relationship, but their love for each other was obvious and true. I could have done without the small exhibitionism scene as I am not into that, but besides that, the love scenes were hot.
