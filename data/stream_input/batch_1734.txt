B0042RJWTC|5.0|I love this show an I always have. The actors portrayed their roles wonderfully! And buying this entire series made me so happy that I have watched it through since I got it!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game. I wish I had more ways of earning coins and jewels, but I am loving it. I am very addicted to this game.
159413586X|5.0|Awesome book. It arrived in perfect condition in a prompt manner. Glad to have read this trilogy, I'd recommend it to any avid reader.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read most of John Grisham's books.  I really enjoyed this latest book.  It keep me wanting more.  After a couple of his books that were just ok, I felt like this one was more like the earlier ones.
B0013GH9AO|5.0|Dr. Dre is among the most influential and essential hip hop artists on the planet.  He didn't do it alone, but there were not many who could reach the bars he set.  This album has defined hip hop and is true to the nature.  If you are a hip hop fan, I would consider this album a requirement in your collection, whether actual CD or mp3 cd.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this app, very addicting. I know it would probably make it too easy, but I wish the walls would come up more often!  :)
B000068FXX|4.0|Supertramp are masters at putting out radio friendly singles, this time it's Give A Little Bit, great song including excellent acoustic guitar playing.<br />The title track, From Now On and Fool's Overture are all good stuff with piano, guitar, saxaphone and woodwind instruments compilmenting clear vocals.<br />Breakfast In America may be their best known album, but this one's not too far behind.
B008AT9XOC|5.0|Little Shop of Horrors is a property I know almost everything about. It's been a part of my life for so many years. I was a part of the musical play in high school. So when I viewed the original Frank Oz film and I saw everything I experienced and was over the moon..........UNTIL the cop out ending of Audrey and Seymour making it out alive!<br /><br />Seriously, in the original play ending as it was intended Audrey dies, is re-fed to Audrey 2 and Seymour commits suicide while trying vainly to hack the plant from it's innards. So when the film was announced to be made, and all these folks who originally viewed the off broadway show started complaining about the legitimate ending, you know what? I CALL FOUL!<br /><br />This director's cut is not just Frank Oz's cut of LSOH, but it's how this film should have been shown to begin with. Yes purists of the play could complain that how Seymour dies in the end is different than the play's ending. But Oz at least kept true enough to the source material to keep the end results more or less the same.<br /><br />I realize that this might also be a nitpick, but no offense to Ellen Greene(the originator of the Audrey role on Broadway) but if you are dying from having your intestines gutted by a carnivorous plant, then logistically you aint singin a long note after or during that point! You are pretty much dead after a two to three sentence stretch! Just sayin.<br /><br />So no offense totally intended to the folks who caused that cop out ending in the \\"other\\" version, but let's see how the better version stacks up. So watch it like I did and then review on here if you think it's too little too late. But I personally don't think so. I'll gladly rate this film a 5 star. Kudos Frank Oz!
B00009V7T2|3.0|I love this album. I had it a long time ago before someone stole it from my CD collection a while back. Finally got around to buying it again and I'm glad I did. One of the tracks skips a bit.. but otherwise the disc is in good condition.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Love it<br />Really I love it.<br />It not a tower defense but more of a wave defence.<br />I would recommend this game even my enemy lol
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|it keeps crashing and every time I try to get on the app it won't let me. Do not buy this app.
1577314808|5.0|I purchased this as a gift; and everything went smooth as silk. I would do it again should the situation arise.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|What is there not to like about a movie (even if based, or maybe particularly because it is based on a children's novel) about a man (okay, a boy starting out) and his horse, their bonding together, their trials and tribulations and their successes (if that is an appropriate term in the midst of bloody carnage).Well, nothing, nothing on this good green earth (and the slice of England portrayed in the film is a very good example of that).<br /><br />Nothing, except man getting in the way of an obviously smarter member of the animal kingdom, one Joey the horse. Why?  Well, man and horse come of age just around the time of World War I when \\"civilized\\" Europe decided that a war to end all wars (they came up a little short, about 300 plus wars somewhere on the planet short since, on that proposition) was necessary to sort things out. So England and its colonies, France and its colonies, Russia and its colonies, and German and its colonies, decided to tear up half of continental Europe to see who the king hell king was anyway. And this war to end all wars happened to occur at just that point when humankind had exponentially increased its technological capacity to kill, to murder, and to maim at will.<br /><br />But not at 2012 levels, so one Joey the horse got \\"drafted\\" into the war and wound  up \\"serving,\\" one way or the other, both sides as beast of burden. But modern wars are not kind to those military whizzes who lived (pardon the expression) in the \\"horse and buggy era,\\" in the thinking of the last war, and so produced sickeningly destructive trench static warfare complete with barbed wire, maddened gas attacks, cavalry charges against fixed machine gun positions and used horse, including Joey (and his horse friend) to lug artillery into position. Madness, pure and simple.<br />And that is where Joey, unlike the Brits, Germans, etc. showed he was smarter than all those guys who knowingly and hopelessly kept going up over those bloody trenches without a murmur. When he had the chance he ran like hell, he \\"deserted\\" like any sane person would. And lived to tell about it (or have it told). Chalk one up for the horse set. And see this film as we near the one hundredth anniversary of the start of World War I in 1914.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome I have had it since laser summer and I still love it. If you don't already have it you should definitely get it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was funny, but has a deeper painful aspect as well. I read it because I heard about the movie. I haven't seen the movie - but if it's anything like the book, I bet it's great. The quirky, honest perspective is very refreshing. I'm a high school teacher, so I enjoyed imagining what was happening with these goofy kids.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|This guy is so talented.WOW!! I crank this up when i clean house. I even bought this for a friend as a gift. Know she will like it as well as i do.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is the usual Grisham novel, well written and imaginative.  It is a nice turn of work on an African American attorney unjustly convicted who in the usual Grisham-like fashion uses the law to liberate himself, get the gold and escape to the Caribbean.  (I would say spoiler alert, but you know how it ends when you start--the fun part is how it gets there.)  It matches his other work in quality and imagination if not in cliff-hanging excitement.  A good read.
160459201X|5.0|THIS IS A MUST READ !!!!! I LOVED THIS BOOK !!! VERY INFORMATIVE AND VERY HELPFUL. IT IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE THE LIMITLESS POWER WHICH WE ALL POSSESS WITHIN!!!
0425264351|4.0|I wonder if I know what the difference between an automatic and semi automatic weapon is, or if the author does?
B001HM1PFO|4.0|I rented this video for Halloween.  I's still the campy, funny musical adventure I remember.  It's an ageless story of good vs bad and unfulfilled desires. Watch it for a laugh.
B007THA4FI|4.0|In typical JK Rowling fashion, the book draws you in right from the start. However, there are a lot of characters to follow and keep track of. Some of the British dialect is a little hard to follow as well, but overall, a very good read!
B001RTP3Z0|4.0|Never knew who he was,never heard of him but i like his music . He is a jazzy folk kind of singer.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It has exceeded my expectations. I had bought this to do some nighttime reading and now I can't put it down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome!!!!!<br />Very good book!! Suzanne done a great job with the anticipation of the reader...was very hard to put the book down once I started reading! Great job!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really don't have a specific genre of books I like to read and bought this book simply because of all the hype and combined with the cheap price.....figured if it was a bad read I'd just delete it.  Well, I was wrong.  I enjoyed it and have purchased the other two books in the trilogy!  I liked the whole story line and the characters are likable.  Looking forward to starting book two!
B009G8GRX6|4.0|This album is great. It has a mix of electronic dub step with rock. This combo is something different that I really love. I only gave it 4 stars because I felt like it was not too original.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|I have two girls, ages 10 and 8. All three of us loved this movie. We saw it in the theater and liked it so much that they asked me to buy it. A modern day beauty and the beast. We walked out the theater feeling happy, what more do you want?
B001RTP3YQ|4.0|I saw him on PBS in concert and i thought he was great .So i bought both the CD and the DVD
0785163174|4.0|From Marvel, we get the top writers and artists pitting two of superhero franchise teams with the backdrop of the fate of the world and humanity. The visual storytelling was solid and gave us a ample story to show home some of the top artists in the superhero game choreograph widescreen fights with some of Marvel's heaviest hitters. For new comic readers this is big clash amongst Marvel heroes with neither team being in the wrong but the story revolving around each pursuing what they believe to be the right course of action.<br /><br />This hardcover also comes with a ton of digital content which is great for reading on the go via your mobile or tablet device. I feel that the digital infinite comic that comes as a download is superior to the printed translation in the hardcover. I will be gifting this hardcover to friends who want to get superhero comics as well as my friends who want a big nerdy superhero fight to sink their eyes and minds into....
B0058YPMGK|5.0|I loved the movie and the show is just as great! It captures the same goofy humor of the movie with the added benefit of being a much cleaner show to watch on television. Great show to watch with anyone!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I watched this movie as a kid and remember liking it a lot. I rewatched it with friends recently through Amazon Instant Video and it's just as good as I remember, and they loved it too -- definitely worth the time and money.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a well written book. It's an easy read that flows nicely. There are no slow parts in this story. I couldn't put it down. There is a lot of backstory about the life of a seal that I found very interesting. It was a good base leading up to the raid. There has been some info here & there about this mission but I wanted to hear it straight from someone who was there. I was worried that it wouldn't be informative because of the nature of this story. I wondered if it would be interesting with all of the secret stuff left out. No worries. It is as good as it gets. The author is still allowed to tell you enough to make it a great read.
B004QL7K70|5.0|I went to this movie in the theater and liked it so much I bought the dvd. Did I go knowing it was going to be about teenagers doing inappropriate things? Yes, I sure did and it made me wish I was back in high school and had been able to attend this party. This movie is not for everyone but I enjoyed it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app should be one without problems considering the number of people who use Facebook for social networking. I am only able to view my Newsfeed from the current day. Not the worst, but certainly needs improvement.
B000002PCS|5.0|What a beautiful Soundtrack by John Barry! The Orchestration was Superb! Absolutely breath taking. Good music to listen to while driving. Very soothing. I just Loved it. Anyone who enjoys' easy listening would like this soundtrack.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I love the way DeMille writes.  As I sit on the edge of my seat, I also feel like I'm getting a history lesson.  I only wish he would clean up his mouth.  He is too good a writer to need the trash talk.  I keep trying to give five stars but three is as high as the screen will let me input.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think everything about it is great. I do not require anything more than this one. And you cannot beat free!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so much fun. if you play it you would like it a lot.it has so many games in just one game
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My friend showed me this game and its awesome just wish there was maybe more of a point to it? I cant think of Much more to say but I just need to meet the twenty word minimum
B007IXWL2C|4.0|These books were a love story encompassing some very different life stlye choices.Of course money always overshadows aspects most people could not afford,special rooms,cooks and house helpetc.
B006OFN0SE|4.0|I thought Leonardo did a good job of playing J. Edgar Hoover being top boss of the FBI around the united states
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|This is an very good stock tracker. The product is simple to use, easy to navigate and updates quickly. I use it on my iPhone and Kindle.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|If you're a fan, get it. The quality is the best ive heard of this album. There is not one song i dislike in this album.
0061733199|5.0|This book is complementary to the Boy Scout Handbook (not trying to say it is somehow tied to it. I just find it useful as a scout leader). It expands on many of the concepts taught there. There are many great graphics that aid in the instruction being delivered by someone who obviously knows a lot about his craft.<br /><br />It also would make an awesome survival manual. If I had to only have one book and was in a survival situation I would want this with me.<br /><br />I am a former Marine infantryman so some of it is old hat for me but there are things I learn every time I look something up to prepare for a scout meeting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was full of drama and sexy detail.  I could not put it down.  I would love to see stories about the other two young couples.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|If you loved music from the 80s and/or Glam Metal music, this movie is definitely for you. I was a little disappointed by the special features that were promised. But the movie is still really great to watch and sing-a-long to, so who cares.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Mamah is an intellectual born before her time. She enjoys a comfortable life complete with lovely children, a nanny, a husband who is pleasant enough, and a home in the Chicago suburbs.<br /><br />The women's suffrage movement is gaining ground in Europe and being introduced in America.  She struggles with what is good for her as a woman in relation to how to best serve her children.<br /><br />The work of Frank Lloyd Wright, his genius architect mind, and his shortcomings are woven together in his career, his relationship with his wife and family, and his great love and devotion to Mamah.<br /><br />This sweeping love story at such a pivotal time in  the history of women's rights kept me riveted to the pages.  I am intrigued by the choices they made and the price they paid for their love.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great book (Omnibus edition on Kindle).  For the price, it is out of this world.  An \\"end of this world story\\" with a twist.  And I would love to go on, and discuss it in detail, but don't want to give anything away.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in our Stars is about a terminally ill cancer patient named Hazel Grace, who is only sixteen years old. After meeting a boy named Augustus who is in remission, she learns to look at life and her situation, in a whole new way. I thought that the characters started off weak, but a few chapters in, I quickly became attached. The story is strong, and will leave you thinking about it hours after you finish.  This book will make you go through more emotions than you ever would watching \\"The Notebook\\". John did a fantastic job in writing the book and I personally couldn't keep my hands off it, and read it in one sitting (Which is a difficult thing for a book to make me do). I would recommend this for anyone who loves a book that will make you laugh, and then a couple chapters later, leave you sobbing. Everyone I know has given this book a great review, and has started reading John Greens other novels. I hope you choose this book because you will not regret it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is so true to the characters of children.  What a heartwarming, thought-provoking book!  It would definitely appeal to adults as well as young adults.  It would be a great book for students to read and discuss in class.  I think there are all kinds of bullying that goes on people are not even aware of.  Reactions to something unpleasant, etc.  This certainly made me question my reactions to things.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Again, I could not put this book down.  I couldn't wait to see what was happening next. I love the way it picked right up where the first book ended.
0375869026|5.0|I had no pre conceived ideas about this book but was hooked from the start.  If you are a teacher, a parent, a parent of a child with different needs, a child with different needs, any person of compassion, this book is full of lifes learning lessons.  I loved the precepts, I loved the spirit of August, the challenges faced by his parents to balance having their child live &#34;normally and specially&#34;, the honesty of the family, the realities of his environment and the biases.<br /><br />I have purchased several copies to give to my school counseling interns who are using them in programs to address bullying, inclusion, diversity and compassion with student and parent groups.<br /><br />Wonder is the gift that will keep on giving.
B002VHI8FE|3.0|Starts slow, but builds well enough to make me want to keep reading.<br /><br />Jumpy- the book jumps from character to character without telling you. This starts off being a little annoying until you get to know all the characters.
B00992CF6W|1.0|It does not work.  Tried to get a refund but nothing. It is  piece of junk, and that is being kind.  Not happy with customer service.  Probably won't use Amazon again for game down loads.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Yes it was highly entertaining to see half naked extremely gorgeous men dance. But definitly could do w/o the cursing...turn off... and the story wasn't anything special. I won't be watching it again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great!  Best Grisham I've read in many years!  The plot reminded me of The Partner in its twists and turns, and Malcolm/Max is an interesting protagonist!  It kept me up several nights!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I've been wanting to read this book , I'm very glad that I have . Anthony really didn't enlighten me but he did entertain me.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|For all the readers who loved bared to you, my most honest advice to you is to read it and to give  it a chance because the book  turns to be very surprising and touching.<br />Sylvia does a  very good job with the characters in the book and after you read it you love them even more.It is very well written and very pleasurable to read.<br />I am looking forward for the next book...
B0009PAVI2|5.0|I have never seen anything so compact and comfortable to carry. Being a photographer I have to carry my filters whenever I am out on work. These filters are expensive and have to be handled with care. I am so concerned about the damage that may be caused due to mishandling. But finally this fear is out of my mind with Tamrac SAS compact filter case. It is not just compact but holds up to three filters securely. It is easy to carry as it can be attached to the shoulder strap or backpack harnesses. I slide it around my belt. The buckle ensures quick opening and closing of the case.
0880796863|5.0|I think that anyone who's interested in modern, intuitive tarot (as opposed to traditional, historical tarot buffs who follow the Marseilles path) MUST own a copy of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, as it's the wellspring from which all the other modern decks have come.<br />This is my preferred version of the deck, too. The soft, subtle colouring appeals to me much more than some of the almost-flourescent newer versions. The colours in particular remind me that this was, graphically at least, a product of it's time - the Art Nouveau period.<br /><br />It's taken a long time for Pamela Colman Smith to get the recognition she deserves. She might not have been the most skilled draftsperson there ever was, and this deck was made in a very brief period of time - but in my opinion, her power was in her subtlety. Slight nuances of expression, muted tones and patterns in the fabrics and fills. In this version of the RWS deck, I can almost feel the lightness of her touch as she painted these images.<br /><br />I agree with others that if you're a beginner, Waite's original booklet isn't a great deal of use - get yourself a good, thorough book like Rachel Pollack's '78 Degrees of Wisdom' in addition.<br /><br />I own a couple of RWS versions and I think that in this case it's true that &#34;the Original is still the best&#34;. I'm so glad this 'Original' reproduction set is available again.
B003G4W49C|5.0|After almost pickin this up and then puttin it off a dozen or more times, I finally was able to read this book.  It did not disappoint whatsoever.  I wanted the story to go deeper into the alien world and to more about the characters.  I didn't really want it to end.  Now after finishing, I am excited to read the other stokes as well.  Mr Card never disappoints.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I'd been wondering if all the talk i've been hearing about Dexter was true.  I can't wait to see more.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The Walking Dead is very addictive, and the characters are awesome! Every week n episode end then I can't wait till see the next one.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Really bad writing. Flynn never met an adjective she didn't like and decide to use in every sentence here. I can't stand the forced &#34;Gilmore Girls&#34; style dialogue that passes for witty. So many people recommended this book that I plunged on, wading through the pointless profanity, including a juvenile passage where one character rattles off a long list of slang names for male masturbation. Was this supposed to impress or amuse us or what, Gillian? By then the plot had sucked me in, so I kept reading. I shouldn't have bothered. It was easy to see every twist and turn ahead, except the ending. No one would have guessed she had such a mediocre ending in store for us. It could be a set-up for a sequel, I guess, but I sure won't be buying that.
B005LAII08|5.0|I rented this the day it came out on DVD.  Boy am I glad I rented this movie!!!  I love this kind of animation to begin with, so this movie was on the top of my to watch list when it came out.  I didn't know a whole lot about this movie, but I knew that it was a family film with great characters and and amazing story line, but I had no idea it could make me cry and want to call my mother!!!  This is such a great movie that I give it five stars and trust me when I say that's not very often that I give a movie five stars.  I am definitely going to add this to my collection and re-watch it over and over again.<br /><br />WATCH THIS!!!!  SO GOOD!!!!
B008458O3S|5.0|I love that there isn't necessarily one way to solve the puzzles. I love tinkering with the tracks until I find a solution. I also like the fact that the sole goal is to solve the puzzle. No time constraints, no score to beat, just solve the puzzling and advance.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|Look, if you like Baron Cohen's sense of humor - then this is a great example of his work. Clearly, a lot of work has gone into Baron Cohen's characterization. Baron Cohen gives himself 100% and I, personally, found this movie hilarious.<br /><br />If you take this movie for what it is then it is good quality. It's not been done cheaply. I especially loved the soundtrack, which was largely made of English songs translated into Arabic (I'm an Arabic speaker and I was literally crying with laughter, it was such a good touch). A lot of thought has gone into the details and the storyline is pretty charming too.<br /><br />If you're not a Baron Cohen fan then why (oh why?) did you watch the movie in the first place? Let alone leave a review on Amazon...<br /><br />I loved it - 5 stars.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I waited what looks like a year for these books to be released for the Kindle Fire. Now that they are here, I am more than pleased. The transfer was clean and you can actually see the page numbers which is another plus. It also helps that it features the signature humor and smarts evident in the rest of the series. Worth the 8 bucks!!
B007LYB4BC|5.0|This is a fantastic debut from a young man who truly loves music. Music made the way it used to be. Before mass production and voice synthesizers.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Law Abiding Citizen is a really awesome thriller that will keep you amazed from beginning to end. Gerard Butler did some pretty cool acting as never seen before in this movie. His role was about a man who got betrayed by the system and the necessary steps he had to take in order to bring that same system down to its knees. Gerard's justice at any cost performance really made him like a hero fighting corruption, which still continues in our society. IS THERE ANY END TO IT!!!
1451695195|5.0|May challenge your traditional view of heaven, certainly did mine.  Last chapter was worth the whole read and the one that brings goosebumps.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|This film is an exceptionally well done version of this Jane Austen classic. it stays true to the book while bringing the characters to life. My favourite movie version of a Jane Austen story.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. Glad to see it on my Kindle too ! Love the community and new people i get to talk to.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book resonates with me. I thought it was an interesting new addition to the puzzle of life after death.
0817439390|5.0|Easy to follow, writen in a way that is easy to understand, good information about lenses used and camera settings for each photo.
B00846REIS|5.0|Really liked this book! Think I liked it better then Shades of Grey! And that was an awesome read! So Bared to You was more so!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|app runs well. definitely worth checking out. its free so no risk. very challenging.  I really like it. its is addicting just like solitaire but with a slightly different flavor.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I have been a fan of the Beatles since day 1. This movie was Happy, sad, Fun, The singers did a great job acting and the actors did a great job singing. It's a must see movie.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Best new fantasy book put out in years!!  The characters have depth, the world is detailed and fleshed out in a very different manner than is on most every other 'English' styled world.  Best fiction read in years!!!!  Can't wait to read the rest of the series in the coming years.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I enjoyed the movie - kind of a gothic, melodramatic comedy.  The cinematography was fantastic and Depp shined, so much so that most of the cast faded into the background.  As an original Dark Shadows fan, I was a bit disappointed in this.  In the movies defense, I knew very little about it before I saw it, so rated it without that factor.  I only saw it once on a small screen.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked the book but wished for more about heaven instead of so much about everything else. As a grieving mother I want to know more about where my son is and that he is ok
B004C3DLJS|5.0|It is cute and easy to follow movie for kids. story flows nicely and kids dont get bored and wathcing until the end. Adults will enjoy movie as well I guess. Nice animation as we can expect from Pixar.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy was the best I've read in a while. Not only did I read them in 1 week, but I've read them 3 times. I can not get enough of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. E.L. James out did herself with these books. I recommend them again and again to anyone. I actually sent this set to my best friend in VA because she asked to borrow my books. So you can see just how good they are!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|It may give some people the creeps but I really related to the Ender character.  Relating to a murdering child genius that exists in social isolation could be creepy.  I found it extremely satisfying.  Ender seems very real to me. The anguish over not wanting to hurt anyone or be hurt but unable to restrain his instinctual competiveness which drives him to kill.  This goes beyond the Ender character with many interesting characters and their thoughts.  The story has a staggering scope in terms of time, distance, emotions and personal growth.  It is so well crafted to combine such opposing elements of compassion and forgiveness and genocide.  One of many interesting qualities of this story is despite all of the violence there is a HUGE message of peace.  This is the type of story that you will be compelled to read again.  Be careful, you may find yourself evaluating your views and bias.  Are you afraid to read somthing that could influence how you think?
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Thanks for sending this item in such a timely fashion.  It works great in the DVD player and I love the quality of the DVD and the package it came in!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I think The Avengers is the best movie since Star Wars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! plus infinity more. I have watched this movie 3 times for The Avengers thats lame. I love all the action and laughs. \\"I will not be beat at saying it is great.  THE AVENGERS RULE 5 STARS
B000V9QWGG|5.0|This movie is awesome. The person whom wrote it has to have a very twisted mind. Some of the stuff he/she comes up with is just amazing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty shades was an excellent read. It made me desire things I never thought I would!  My husband definitely benefitted from my reading this book.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Finally a free app of the day without crazy permissions. Runs smoothly on galaxy nexus, humorous premise on solid gameplay.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is amazing but the version hasn't updated like the ipod version has. UPDATE PLEASE!!! I want the nether!!! And paintings!
B0095R64AO|2.0|Movie seemed 5 years long.  Had high hopes for this movie as Jason Segal is typically funny..  Very few funny moments in this movie.
B003006WRC|5.0|I am biased as I am in the camp that loves Michael Moore. Also, I have lived outside of the US for 7 years and I can tell you that socialized medicine is the way to go (just ignore the 'social' part and imagine a world where you do NOT have to worry about facing bankruptcy if you or a family member has a catastrophic illness. I can say there is another way to provide health care to the masses. We the people are going to have to finally own up to the fact that we want to live in a society that takes care of everyone involved. Yes, it will raise taxes but what you don't realize is that the taxes will be less then what you have to shell out on a monthly bases now. How? By controlling costs, simple as that.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The new versoin of minecraft pe came out its in the google play store ps cant get apps for kindle if you want apps from google play you neex to root or jailbreak your kindle.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|I wasn't impressed much by the initial premise, but I sure was wrong! Your purpose is to slice the ice into as small of a piece as possible in order to gather ice for a drink. Sounds simple, right? Well, you have to do it while keeping moving penguins together as a group and leaving them unharmed. You can slice the ice however you want to, so long as you don't violate the aforementioned. If you're experiencing difficulty, there are power-ups that you can use that may assist you. These must be purchased by coins when you run out, which you can earn as you progress through the game. Some tips that might not be readily noticeable:<br /><br />- Your line of slicing will remain there for a few seconds if you don't lift your finger, so you can draw the line that you want and wait for all of the penguins to cross it before letting go.<br />- You can tap on penguins to change their direction, which may help if they're bouncing around in an area you don't want them to.
B0053Q9DHW|1.0|left out half of the movie...no intimate personal conversations between the two that explain their relationship and how they felt about each other.  I was very disappointed in this movie.
B000YAFE0M|5.0|This movie is cleverly orchestrated, smart, well written, and you do not figure out the end until \\"the end\\" comes.  Ryan Gosling is brilliant as the young attorney originally seeking wealth to end up seeking \\"justice.\\"  Anthony Hopkins is, as always, fabulous.
B003XC5OHG|5.0|Normally my husband and I shy away from musical plays. But, being Sweeney Todd fans, we went to this movie anyway. Love Tim Burton's version so much we based our Halloween costumes on Mrs Lovett and Sweeney Todd this year.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Nice 'sittin on the toilet game', graphics are good, sound is good, and it's fun to play.<br /><br />On the + side, the only permission it asks for is to keep the screen from closing.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I made this purchase about a year ago and I must say that I bought it based on the reviews on obviously the majority of the reviews that detailed features, first look and useability on day one. The one that I missed was it's durability. It worked like a charm for me and exactly like what the reviews here have wrote about, and I was very happy with it, to be honest.<br /><br />However, as time goes by, the constant plugging and unplugging of the charging connector on the headset took it's toll and the warning signs came when I had to wiggle the connector around to make the connection so it would charge. Alas, the wiggling delivered it's final punch and the connector broke. This did not allow the headset to be charged anymore. A friend who made the same purchase had exactly the same issue and manage to get his set replaced while I could not.<br /><br />For me personally, the price is not worthwhile for a headset that will only last 1 year.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I love to play spider solitaire. This app is easy yo use and easy to see. Sometimes it freezes, but that is usually when the ads are playing.
B000ID37KO|5.0|I have always loved \\"The Birds\\" and it is great to have a copy on DVD for my home film collection. What makes this movie so unique among Hitchcock's work is that it has an almost supernatural feel to it. In most of Hitchcock's films the mystery comes from the actions of other people -- spies, criminal, psychopaths, etc. In \\"The Birds\\" the \\"villains\\" are birds, not people. The film also leaves you hanging with more questions than answers, which in its context is perfectly acceptable and indeed part of its appeal. The final shot is one of his best. You will NEVER look at a group of birds sitting on a wire the same way after watching this movie.
1934030597|5.0|You can tell Mr. Zinn like bikes when you read this comprehensive book.  Full of great ideas, tips, and detailed procedures for repairs.  Good coverage of tools and emergency repairs.  Illustrated with drawings which are clear for the most part.  I find it helpful to have another book (by Todd Downs) to complement this one for ultimate clarity and coverage.
1878424319|5.0|This book changed my life. I highly recommend it for those who can look at themselves and their lives objectively. Otherwise the you may not get anything from it
1419705849|5.0|I pre ordered this item for my son. The book arrived a few days ago when I was out. By the time I got home he had already read the entire book:) Me is 8 years old and in 2nd grade. This is his favorite series. Definitely recommend this item.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This is a great value.  You get every Matrix movie including the Animatrix and the special features for all the movies plus it comes packaged into a very sturdy cardboard box with a very nicely done cover art.  These movies are wonderfully experienced in High Definition unlike allot of Blu Ray movies that are re-released in High Def there is not the grainy issues with the picture and the sound quality is great.  Buy this you will be  happy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is awesome because it has so many bifferent games that are so cool.Some of the games are so amazing I could play 24/7!!!!!!!!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is not a bad app, it works well and have found it to be very useful Would recommend it
1573301183|5.0|If you truly a fan of this band and would love to hear their last performance then this is the DVD for you. My brother was hoping they would give this on tv again but they haven't for years so this DVD made him very happy. Order came quick and in great condition.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great read from Vince Flynn. He has been sick and previous book maybe not quite as good as his others. This book has great characters and plot. One of his best.
B009B4ZEKM|1.0|It sucks dont buy it it is the worst thing i ever heard. I couldnt even finish listening to it. Just dont buy it.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|After the program downloaded an additional amount. of data today. it started acting glitchy. the program no longer runs smoothly and seems to be losing track of the tokens I've accumulated that count toward a current goal I'm pursuing. please fix :'(
B007JM4CWY|5.0|The game takes a bit to really get used to, but after that it becomes addicting.  It is exciting to see a puzzle come to life and the company has been very good about updating it with new puzzles.  My only complaint is that it could use a hint button that actually helps you on an individual puzzle.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Been wanting to see this movie for years so I'm happy I have it now. Great actors in the movie and can't wait to enjoy this movie over and over again. Order came fast and in good shape with just a lil scratch on the box but the DVD itself is in great condition.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Movie got off to a strong start...the young lincoln becoming a vampire slayer...second half intertwining his presidency with the vampires was week
6305744793|5.0|I ordered this movie for my grandson's 23 birthday. He used to watch it constantly as a small child, just over and over. He called it &#34;Broken Hand.&#34;
1936608618|5.0|If there's a more comprehensive look at what it takes to get stronger, faster, and fitter, I haven't seen it. Brian's done a fantastic job collecting everything he's learned over the last ten years of training and running CrossFit Endurance seminars, and I couldn't recommend this book enough.
B005LAII80|5.0|What a crime that this movie did not do better at the box office.  It so successfully melded the sensibilities of the types of bloody action/sci-fi movies we saw in the '80s with those of the frenetic action films of today.  It was a wonderfully, gruesomely violent blend of future cop madness and black humor.  Karl Urban is absolutely perfect as the stoic, no-nonsense Judge Dredd (and never takes off his helmet-awesome!).  You need to see this great sci-fi action movie if you missed it in theaters.  It's greatness stuck with me for days afterward.  What a blast!
0307592731|5.0|This book is non fiction, but reads like fiction.  I usually don't read books that aren't fiction.  I would recommend it to any woman who is struggling or has had life struggles.
1591841666|1.0|My low rating is for two reasons.  The first is that the writing is not very good. It reads like a first draft that was never proofed. Also, it says the same thing a hundred different ways, which makes this very short books seem like 70% filler. The second reason for my low rating is that Seth's left-leaning political sensibilities show through (e.g. he laments Joe Biden's failed presidential run).
B004EPYZTE|1.0|Sad to say it, but I like the original more.  Not it's sequels, which were horrible.  Just the original film.  The music, the humor, and the characters.  In my opinion this film was a complete waste of my time.  There was nothing this did that the original did not do better--except this version has special effects.  Even the quality of the 3D (I saw this on the big screen) was lousy compared to films like Avatar or Titanic in 3D.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|This is a good album, not a big Swift fan but I do like some the songs its was not what I expected.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|There's simply no greater, more compelling series on television than Mad Men. Season 5 keeps the script as fresh as Seasons 1-4. Tremendous story telling, magnetic acting and a brilliant dose of both history and surprise at every turn.  Cheers. And I mean, a highball full of George Dickel #12, cheers!
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Let's face it guys, we're from Earth and I guess women are from Venus?... This movie shows us how to communicate with these alluring if not utterly confusing Venusians. Ryan Gosling represents us Earth men as a hard-working fella who is in absolute love with the stunning representative for Venus, Rachel MacAdams.<br />Without spoiling the story, we Earth men can learn a lot from the steadfastness to which Ryan's character holds on to the love of the goddess from Venus, despite the hurdles and setbacks that many of us Earth men would find insurmountable, or just plain not worth it.<br />There is enough educational material here to help Earth men win the love and trust of the other worldly-females that we find so irresistable.
0345803485|5.0|The book was AMAZING!!! It was much more than a romantic/erotic novel. The storyline is great and so are the characters.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds encourages small motor development, challenges strategy, makes kids giggle at the sounds and expressions of the targets and best of all....it's FREE!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|It is a really exciting story!  Unfortunately, there are too many pauses, too many blank spots in the dialogue.  This 526 page book would have been much better at 300 pages!
0792164903|5.0|One of my fav movies so I thought it was time to own it. It came early and the DVD was new
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best season so far. This has just gotten better. So glad I am able to watch these within hours after airing. No cable for us so this works perfectly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fascinating and intriguing storyline. It grasps your imagination and doesn't let go. Makes you think as if you are there in the arena.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The trilogy was very entertaining and the story like no other book I have ever read.  Lisbeth Salendar's character is brilliant, wish I had her incredible mind.
B002R27J1W|5.0|Still suspenseful after all these years! A favorite at our house, scared the pants off our teenager with it. Great!
030758836X|1.0|Story had potential, but the characters - even the \\"good\\" ones, are so completely loathsome and their actions so completely unbelievable that you just end up hating everyone in the book.  The only thing worse than the characters is the ending which leaves you feeling sick, disappointed, and wishing you could wash off the residue of the awful journey you just wasted your time & money on!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I love Grisham - but I honestly felt like two different authors wrote this book.  The first half - detailing the main charachter's incarceration, life in prison, plan for escape/revenge, etc. was gripping.  But when this man so desperate for freedom finally gets free - what does he do?  Keep a low profile, volunteer for pro bono work?  Um, no.  He takes on a new persona, charters a private jet to Jamaica and smuggles drugs in order to frame a suspect, etc., etc.  Gimme a break...
B008EZVNO0|5.0|After a couple of albums that did not grab me..... The Magic is without question back! His band and his horn have never sounded so good. I love this one, every song is better then I have heard him in years! a Masterpiece!
B00005LC4B|4.0|Robert De Niro plays a really awesome bad guy in Cape Fear.  After spending 14 years in prison, Robert De Niro is finally free from prison and is now after the lawyer (played by Nick Nolte) who defended Robert in court but was ultimately unable to keep him from going to jail.  It's amazing just how young Robert De Niro looks!  I totally forgot, haha.  His hair is slick black and long.  Yeah, not what I'm used to seeing these days!  Not only that, but he was able to change his accent for this movie and plays a really good clever, conniving and secretly violent character.  Someone who pretends to be nice and innocent but is actually planning to do severe harm to Nick's family.  He pretends to be a savior, and the best aspect is how he frequently leans dangerously close to the point of breaking the law but never crosses the line (well, until later on that is).<br /><br />Until you look back and take the movie as a whole, only then will you realize that this movies strongest point is perhaps the relationship between Nick's daughter and Robert De Niro, and the way Robert pretty much plays the ultimate mind games with her head and totally convinces her that it's her parents who are the bad ones, and not her (or Robert).  The segment where she walks down into the school basement and Robert is pretending to be a teacher when he's actually lying just to get some alone time with her is pure gold.  Pure awesomeness!  A VERY well done segment that's not the least bit overlong either.  Oh, and the entire ending with Nick's family and Robert De Niro on the boat is REALLY intense.  I loved every moment of that boat-swirling segment!<br /><br />Overall, perhaps the orchestration is the only aspect that I don't really enjoy.  It's overdramatic during all the suspenseful scenes, and these days such a thing comes off as sort of cheesy.  Nick playing a lawyer is a little bit of a strange decision since he doesn't seem to fit in that role.  Either way, Robert's character prevails and *makes* this movie watchable.  He alone makes up for a predictably written script.  However, it wasn't predictable back in the day like it is now.  So yeah, Cape Fear is slightly dated.  Either way, it's suspenseful enough that I can easily look past the flaws and highly recommend it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Never wrote a review before.  But I had to on this item.  I had previously purchased a case from Lifeproof and wanted a second. So when I got this item out of the box I immediately knew it was a cheap fake, the front protector was glued on and strings of glue were hanging out.  Trying to save money, backfired.  Back it went.
0307951529|4.0|Many ideas of how to startup with litlle or no money at all. But many of them above the $100 bucks said at the title of the book (little disaponting...) All in all, it is so worth the time and money spent in it. I do recomend!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The many different scenarios keep you guessing! This is a must read for whoever likes to be kept on their toes.
1451627289|5.0|When I first read the basic premise for this book, ie, some guy goes back in time to try to kill Lee Harvey Oswald before Oswald can assasinate President Kennedy, I almost did not bother to buy it. But I am delighted I did. I should never have doubted the master. Once he began to weave his magic, I was lost. No point in summarising the plot; many reviewers have done that already. But the imagination that went into King's pseudo-scientific examination of time-travel and its effect on the traveller are weirdly convincing. The personification of Time itself into an implacable enemy attempting to derail the hero's plans is horrifying.<br /><br />These, and many other elements of the novel described by other reviewers, make 11.22.63 compulsive reading. But it is his extraordinarilly detailed and utterly accurate evocation of the 50s and 60s, the intense research that went into presenting the era of his own childhood with such nostalgic precision,, the images and sounds and tastes of those times so lovingly recreated, that make this book, for me, one of his best<br /><br />I am around King's age and I lived every second of his trip back to those gentle times. Oh, they were times of hardship, poverty, rationing...but there was so much trust in the general population in those days, so little of the horror and evil that blights much of today's world. And I smile when I see again through King's eyes the 50's cars with their huge gull wings, the 'new look' clothes, the kids congregating in the local pharmacy/cum ice-cream stores with their 'snugs' and juke-boxes. I lived it and I loved it and King has brought it all back. What a wonderful book..and, I hasten to add, what a wonderful story. Read it. You'll love it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this book and series! Kept my attention every second i read! Never wanted to stop! Cant wait for next book!!!!!!

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I WAS!!! very happy with this App for Android (2.3) tablet for months.... then it stop working not sure why, it just crashes. I've since moved on to KOBO and I'm getting that satisfied and \\"happy\\" feeling again.. Hmm if something doesn't work replace it with something that does work. lesson learned!! please apply this method of common sense to our political environment... amazing COMMON SENSE what a concept.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Have only had this a few days, but it's a great way to remind myself of stuff no matter where I am. Y'know how you have those 2am thoughts that keepyou awake? If you have you Evernote device (Ipod Iphone Kindle etc) handy,you can jot it down on Evernote, ans it'll travel with you. I'm making grocery lists, work to-dos, lists of books I want to purchase, and a bunch of other stuff on this. So far, I love it!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I needed no proof of Heaven when I bought the book but I always like to read people's journey to \\"visit\\" Heaven.I was so pleased that he \\"Knew\\" what he was explaining to us.I really enjoyed it.[[ASIN:B008AK8FHM Proof of Heaven]]
B0098460O4|5.0|I could listen to these two young people all day long.  If you love opera this is a must have but it if far more then just opera.
1936608618|5.0|The perfect addition to my health, fitness, nutrition, and performance library!  This book is extremely comprehensive and well put together.  It covers everything from A-Z when it comes to power, speed, and endurance.  I am in a special operations unit that continuously seeks out the experts in maximizing performance as well as training longevity.  Brian McKenzie and Kelly Starrett are two of those experts and this book is PRICELESS!
0062127241|3.0|I tore into the package with eager anticipation, looking forward to learning about the Amazing Journeys in the life of one of the most gifted songwriters of my generation. I gravitated to The Who only after Tommy -- never understood the guitar smashing, and only now am discovering some of their songs I'd never heard. At first I was impressed with this book, but the more I read, it seemed like the minutes of a business meeting. After Pete left The Who, the book took a turn downhill and detailed what to me were boring details of projects I couldn't care less about, and then it moved to the explanation of the pedophile charge. The last third to half the book is almost like one of those ghost-written political memoirs -- it details 'just the facts, ma'am, nothing but the facts.'<br /><br />I was relieved to finish it and I was almost disgusted that I took the time to finish it. I kept looking for feelings, about how it felt to live this amazing life, and how it must have felt to be around the geniuses in that band. There was hardly a word about Keith Moon, little more about John Entwhistle (both dead), and little more about Roger Daltry. Perhaps it was honest, but to be truthful, it was downright boring in spots, and I found it almost unforgivable what it omitted. I resented having spent time reading too many details about his business deals, and I was scratching my head about the LACK of details and feelings about the dalliances he included, and also about his marriage and current relationship. After living that life, and all those event-filled years with geniuses, after being around all those women, he still feels closed up as tight as a can of Heinz Baked Beans. Finishing this left me cold, disappointed, filled with compassion, and miffed at what was not covered, and at what was. Pfffffft!
0763644765|5.0|I got this Potty book for my 18 month old son along with 3 other books. I received all four books with the potty. I sat him down and read each book. He sat and listened to each story as I read and acted them out. At the end he selected this one for me to read again, and everyday since. I try to pick up the others and he takes them and tosses them aside. He brings this book to me every time he wants to sit on the potty. He loves this book. Don't bother with any other book, this is the one that they understand and enjoy.
0307593525|5.0|I love it.  Again, I wish there were pictures, but it will be a great learning experience.  Why more words?
0307592731|3.0|I enjoy most nonfiction travel tales, especially outdoorsy treks such as this. And for the most part, I liked \\"Wild\\". Ms. Strayed has an engaging, open and honest writing style. Her experiences on the PCT are an interesting read. She is admittedly fortunate it turned out well given her lack of preparation and proper gear. However, I did feel that sometimes she got a little TOO self deprecating, self critical, self absorbed and introspective for my taste. She just goes on and on at times about the troubles in her life, especially her mother's death and failed marriage. I understand the importance and place of using a journey such as her long hike as an opportunity for reflection and coming to grips with life, but at some point you kind of feel like saying, \\"Get over it and move on!\\" Someone could probably write a good satirical spoof of this book, with lines like, \\"As I closed the lid on my water bottle, I realized that water bottle was like my relationship with my ex-husband: At one time cool and refreshing, but now cut off and dry. And it was all my fault for closing the bottle. And yet I knew I would always love that bottle\\". A friend of mine read this book and had a similar perspective. I'm sure this comes off as insensitive. I'm not saying I don't enjoy some level of introspection and emotional honesty, just that this book went a little overboard for my personal taste, that's all. Still liked the book overall though. Certainly made me want to hike the PCT someday, albeit much better prepared!
B009329ZF2|3.0|This was a fun movie to watch, but too predictable to be great.  I wouldn't buy this movie but I would maybe watch it again.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I like Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child.  This holds your interest; but other ones were better.  I look forward to the movie
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Better than Upstairs/Downstairs.  This is Theater at its best!  Writing, Costumes, Scenery, and of course, and amazing cadre of outstanding actors!  When is Season 3 coming out?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy is the best I've read I a very long time.  I normally can't sit still long enough to finish a book and this one has captivated me!
B0006AAS5G|5.0|This watch is a very nice watch and in my opinion looks MUCH better in person. The face is big but not overly big. Overall it is a very nice, timeless watch to go with anything on any occasion.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|I thought it wasn't  a good example of her work. It was very depressing sounding and I was not impressed by this CD.
B004UID2LC|5.0|YouTube downloader is great; it has allowed me to download free cartoons that I use to entertain my kids when we travel. They play and replay the cartoons they like, leaving me to focus on driving.
B000YDG5X4|4.0|so far these boots are great.  they are very comfortable.  found that they run larger as others have said-my experience approx 1 full size.  normally wear ~11, but 10 in these boots plenty big enough
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Great set...I thoroughly enjoyed it. I just hope Shea labeouf could be digitally erased from the 4th movie.  I just hope he doesn't get cast as the child of Han Solo and Princess Leia in the upcoming Disney savagery
B00914JWSW|3.0|I thought it was going to be a new release of music not some older music she had recorded previously.
B005OSUKSA|5.0|This man can make even the classics new. His passion resonates with every note. If you have not checked out his works, please do yourself a favor & do it!!
B00979CS50|4.0|Okay - I heard an advance copy of this - and yes - it's true - it's the best Neil Young in 20 years... atleast since \\"Ragged Glory\\".<br />But! I'm not payin' 70 bux for this...<br />You gotta' be kidding me...<br />69.99 for a 2xLP - forget about it...<br />I'll wait a month and buy the CD used for 8 bux.<br />I'm no cheapskate - I'd pay 24.99 - 29.99... I understand vinyl is expensive...<br />Anyhow - if you want to know if this is good - the answer is YES - very good.<br />It's oldschool Crazy Horse... but sounds current.<br />I hope the price goes down so I can add this to my collection.<br />Neils stuff often starts out high - but, goes down in price (probably because of poor sales).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I suppose I might be called a \\"dirty old man,\\" but I thought it was great.  The sex descriptions were among the most erotic I have ever read, and I enjoyed the female POV.  Great read.  When I cool off, I may try the next one on my Kindle Fire.
B004I744AS|5.0|Thus app provides a search bar at the top of the page where I can quickly go to ask the meaning of words, but I hardly ever use this feature.<br />Instead, each day I scan down a list of a variety of interesting facts about history, literary quotes, a selected word definition, a horoscope reading, and my favorite - a short vocabulary match-up test. I love the test because these are not easy words! Sometimes my mind has to scramble through its foggy knowledge of Latin word roots to guess at the answers.<br />You can also play hangman, do a spelling bee, and click on the items of interest for in-depth information with links.<br />It's an app that always makes me feel more well-informed each time I check it. Loads quickly, doesn't take up a lot of memory. Your basic dream app.
B003O86MY8|5.0|This CD is as sensational as any of his previous work. His classical influence mixed with the rock-n-roll is a true show of his genius. My husband & kids even love this album (and they are NOT classical fans!!)
B00785P2QC|5.0|virtual city play ground is amazing not a better game doesnt take wifi and you get money even when the app is closed the only bad thing is energy its hard to get:-)
B0058VW36U|5.0|It's a lot of fun to play. I really enjoy it! The graphics are really good and I've not had any problems with the app.
B001UW58WW|5.0|This man really should be more popular in the States. His music is amazing, everything has a piece of him in it. He's a stunning artist anyone would be lucky to have in their collection!
1423140605|4.0|It was still great though but not excellent. I thought there would be more action. I will definitely buy the sequel.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Another amazing album from one of the best bands in music, Deftones!  A great collection of songs that I have had on repeat and can not get enough of!  The album has a pop and catchy sensibility to it, with a 'night time' feel which I really enjoy.  I know chino stated \\"diamond eyes was a night time record\\" and I can see the transition of that flowing into this one.  Coming from a dedicated fan of the band since White Pony (and chino's side projects) I would personally rank this album up with S/T and Diamond Eyes. Go buy it!!
B000YKE87W|5.0|This is the first one I got of these that I bought, and I must say Jonas Kaufmann is wonderful!!!!<br />I just hope he records some of these full operas on DVD.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|First, it is Frank Sinatra.  Second, he is backed by Count Basie and his orchestra.  It is simply the best that Frank has performed.
B008ADUHKW|5.0|My husband brought this book and absolutely loves it. Yet another book from an amazingly talented writer and storyteller. I plan to read it next.
B009AZZEU2|1.0|after listening to this i cant believe the soundgarden fans from 20 years ago actually like it,superunknown,motorfinger,upside are all great albums but this just isnt in the same league,i was so looking forward to this album but just sounds like more weak watered down cris cornell solo material,not one song stands out and is memorable and grabs ya!
B000JPRPAO|5.0|This movie is constanty thrilling. from the start when they're pulling a heist in venice all the way through to their get a way in the end.<br />wow what a movie!
B009AZZEU2|4.0|I generally concur with most reviewers here that A.) it's great to have this band back, and B.) the album definitely meets or surpasses expectations - as good as \\"Down on the upside\\", but not up to the level of \\"Superunknown\\". And that's where I focus my (slight) criticism. That album outshines (no pun intended) all their other albums, in my opinion, but I think the reason for that is the reason a lot of bands inexplicably end up with only one really superior album: the producer. In the case of \\"Superunknown\\", that would be the great Michael Beinhorn (Ozzy, Korn, Marilyn Manson), who was obviously instrumental in making that album the masterpiece that it is. If he had been brought aboard for this new one, I think it would have turned this \\"really good\\" comeback album into \\"truly great\\". Maybe next time.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I have about 6 different versions of a Christmas Carol, and this ranks as my second favorite.  I also have all the Muppet movies.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It was great to finally find it on bluray at such a great price.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is great of \\"on the go\\" facebook. Improves with every update. Great if you like to stay in touch on the go via facebook
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|i am currently travelling in australia, down under was recommended to me but it was not available on kindle so I got in a sunburnt country and it is wonderful.  I feel like bill Bryson is with me on this trip.  It is enlightening, oh so funny and packed with great information and history.  I can't wait to read his other books.
0547564651|5.0|Paul Tough has written a brilliant book about the education challenges facing America and how we can help our youth become more successful.  If we wish to increase both high school and college graduation rates -- and if we hope ever to solve the riddle of generational poverty in a wealthy nation -- understanding the nature of \\"grit, curiosity and character\\" is critically important.  As the scientists whose research is cited in Tough's book have learned, these forms of social/emotional intelligence can be cultivated; and, when they are, the positive effects on students' lives can be breathtaking.<br /><br />Savor this book, and give a copy to a friend!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't get y there r squiggly lines in my tablet.it was ok but the book was big and liked it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. I am now addicted to this game so much so that I am putting off doing my school work to play.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I got this cd as a gift, but I also love this band. I had heard the song \\"Hey Ho\\" on xpn, and thought I'd give their other songs a try. The music is beautiful and catchy and makes for a fun cd.
3866155239|5.0|One of my favorite books. Heller makes every character strong and compelling. He was brave to set this book in World War II, which most people agree that while tragic, was necessary, rather than a more controversial war, like Vietnam.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The four Alien movies comprise what is indisputably one of Hollywood's best series, and this incredible Blu-ray treatment does it justice.  I can remember seeing Alien as a kid and being blown away and terrified.  This was the film that started my love for science fiction.  As a teenage girl seeing Aliens, how could I not be amazed by Sigourney Weaver in full-on action hero mode?  I'm sure most people will agree that the third and fourth movies did not meet the impossibly high bar set by the first two, but this anthology is well worth it for the wonderful extras (60 hours' worth) and the massive improvement in picture quality.  The packaging is great - it's in booklet form, with thick, cardboard-like pages, containing beautiful photographs and artwork.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|If you are interested in Soviet states, North Korea, or nonfiction type stories of human struggle, I would recommend this book to you. This book is accessible (not too technical) but is descriptive enough for someone from a nonhistorical/nonpolitical background to appreciate the harsh reality of living in a place where Western ideals of freedom are not part of reality. A great reminder that the world is not all e-readers and lattes.
0316228532|1.0|I admit, when I heard Rowling was coming out with a new book, I got a bit excited. Despite knowing it wasn't a HP, I still had high expectations. I figured with the success she had with the HP series, there was no way anything she put out could bomb. Then, I started to read this book. Fortunately, I'm thankful that, despite this bomb, I mean book, she is such an amazing author, this book did not kill her career. Please, Ms. Rowling, just publish the HP Encyclodpedia so your fans don't disappear.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked shades of grey you'll like bared to you!! Had a hard time putting it down!!!  Can't wait to read book 2
B008D28HYS|5.0|Played the first level and didn't really get it, kinda thought the game was too easy. I have since spent many many hours solving these and loving it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is an excellent book. I had a very hard time stopping at night to go to sleep.<br /><br />The characters were all interesting and well developed. The story is terrific as well, with plenty of suspense. I especially liked the way the author reveals the back story throughout the book, as if you were peeling an onion (a very tasty onion!).
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a awesome game you should relly think about geting it ther is surivile and creative.it may look like a lot of Mony but it it worth it.it is my favret game!!!!!!!so if you like to be creative get this game.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Awesome!  A true love story. So much more than I expected. Christian is clueless about what he wants until he meets Ana.  She is the balm to his wounds.  And Christian helps Ana discover herself.  She is the one with the strength, she continues to grow.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander's miraculous recovery from a seven-day coma due to an attack on his brain by e. coli meningitis is beyond scientific explanation. Eben's chance of survival was down to 3 percent, and survival without neurological deficit as he did today was practically zero. By all accounts, he shouldn't be alive and telling his story today. His story bears testimony to the existence of an all loving God and the reality of the afterlife, something which we should all pause to consider &#34;what if&#34; our skeptical views were wrong. His seven-day (seven, the sacred number) coma in the hospital was well documented and his brain was effectively shut down, eliminating all possibilities that his trip to heaven was the result of hallucination. That this story is told by a renown neurosurgeon and a one time skeptic himself is even more engaging to the reader. A must read for anyone who doubt the existence of heaven, and hell.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I like this app, I have it on my Kindle. There are lots of tools you can use, the artwork comes out pretty realistically. I got this for myself, but my kids liked it too,lol :0)
B0090YHSFC|3.0|It's kinds of like the old game Qix. The difference is that instead of chopping lots of lines to get it smaller and smaller, you are encouraged to try to finish the game in 1 slice. That means you usually just sit there waiting and waiting and waiting until that one perfect slice comes. That's boring,  not challenging.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this app and it downloads videos fast. I could care less about the porn ads, I just ignore them. I copy all the videos to my PS3 or computer and watch on my TV without internet! best of all, I can download HD if available!
0545123275|1.0|In all honesty, I was REALLY looking forward to this book. Many readers have recommended Maggie S. writing and I just had to get my hands on it. Midway through, I gave up. This book is so boring; I wanted to gauge my eyes out. Grace is in love with a wolf, apparently, who saves her from being savaged into pieces by other wolves when she was 11 and that's when he sort of fell for her first. Once weather warms up, he becomes a boy. His relationship with Grace is INSTANT. There is no build up or time to grow. They are immediately in love with each other, and that love brings out so much selfishness in them.<br /><br />Book is written from two points of view, but Sam and Grace are so similar, it was hard to tell which POV I was reading. He immediately starts crashing at her bedroom, parents of course, oblivious to it and she pretty much begs for more than just kissing, and like every teenage boy, he....says no!? Where did I read that before? Oh wait, Twilight did it. At least Edward had a reason (horrible reason but a reason nonetheless) not to be with Bella physically. Same came off as a middle aged woman. No teenage boy talks the way he does.<br /><br />Since I didn't finish it, this is all I can offer in my review. I checked my facebook at least 20 times while attempting to read this book. Boring, predictable...boring. Did I mention BORING?
B001AQO400|1.0|The image quality of this movie is just TERRIBLE!!! Image looks washed out, grainy and color is bad, some scenes looked worst than VHS. I purchased Trading places with Eddie Murphy and for being a much older movie it had much better image quality. I have a 55 inch Samsung plasma 3D tv. What a rip off this movie is!!! I can not believe it is legal to sell such crappy product with a Blu Ray label on it. I am sending it back for a refund. It looks like I am watching VHS on a really expnsive tv. For those of you reviewing the movie itself, GET A CLUE!!! This is AMAZON NOT IMDB!! We should all help each other and describe the quality of the blu ray so others dont waste their time and money on garbage like this!!!
0446547646|5.0|to give us reading and watching material that always makes you have good feelings.  Each new writing makes you wonder what he will come up with next time.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I was 16 when \\"Down on the Upside\\" came out. Not many bands can go on hiatus that long and come back and have it not sound a bit forced. It's definitely where Chis Cornell belongs. His solo work and the Audioslave albums were all good efforts and certainly not bad but something was missing. Something was so tight about how Soundgarden sounded and when they cut the track for \\"The Avangers\\" I was hoping there was more to come. \\"King Animal\\" is worth the 16 year wait. Maybe they're older and wiser musically but they're playing the nineties Seattle sound we all know and love and better than ever. It's a really great album with no filler. It flows like a rock album should done by a band who cares what they sound like.
1596177373|3.0|We got the cards under the impression that all or at least most were featured on the cards. Only the 3 little boys with masks are on the cards. I gave it 3 stars because jack skelington was on the joker cards.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this series, I was so excited when I heard about it after reading the original short story! Not much to say, except that I think every sci-fi fan should check this out.
0316228532|3.0|Overall, this book was rather depressing because of how it portrayed faulty personalities.  Author capitilized on each character's flaws.  Story line basically spoke of each class level and the turmoil that living together brings.  The only character who appeared to be a &#34;good guy&#34; died in the first few pages.  Not what I expected from J.K. Rowling.
013216292X|5.0|The book arrived well before the scheduled arrival date and in absolutely fantastic condition. It almost feels like buying a brand new copy. It is of course an earlier edition but any book by Oppenheim and Schafer is a classic!
B005XN0SGU|5.0|Ok I rarely do reviews on apps cause its just not worth my time to review everything I get, but after getting Perfect Viewer I am so happy with everything it does so I can read my comical on my kindle. Pictures great and the zoom in is very handy at times. Well worth 3 bucks.
B0085RZGYU|5.0|The 5th Camel Club book by David Baldacci, \\"Hell's Corner,\\" continues (or brings to a close?) the very popular Camel Club series.  This rag-tag, diverse group of characters becomes endearing to the reader; in fact, we grow to \\"care\\" about them and what happens to them. With the strong and mysterious Oliver Stone leading the group, this club's misfit characterization keeps the reader captivated from one dangerous encounter to another. As usual with this series, nothing is ever quite what it seems to be.  Sadly, this may be Oliver Stone's and the Camel Club's last stand. Regardless of whatever may be, \\"Hell's Corner\\" lives up to its name and is, as is the rest of the series, a must read!  , If you have not read the other books  in this series, this is unquestionably one of those series that makes a lot more sense for greater understanding, background, and the characters' development and relationships to read them in order, but it is not absolutely critical.<br /><br />Baldacci is a master of plot, dialogue, and character; \\"Hell's Corner\\" is not an exception to this. In this book, there is a huge security threat when a bomb goes off in the roots of a tree in Lafayette Park, also known as Hell's Corner, across from he White House. The president himself has requested that Oliver Stone once again serve his country even though Stone has fought for decades to leave his past behind, he feels he must say yes and serve once again.  A new partner for Stone is British MI-6 agent Mary Chapman. But their opponents are elusive, capable, and increasingly lethal; worst of all, it seems that there may be a mole - a traitor - giving these killers advance information.  As before and with reluctance, the Camel Club once again joins forces to save the day!  Certainly, it gets a little far fetched in places (like a billion dollar payoff!), but it's fiction and this series is always a fun read. You will not be disappointed with this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I couldn't believe my eyes when this came out! It is a wonderful game that is worth the money. I have always wanted the computer version, but this version is cool to. Great game, and the only thing bad is waiting for the updates. I would recommend this to anyone!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I have not watched the US version so I can not comment on it, but the original BBC version is wonderful. I've been watching it with my son and he loves it as well even though he gets a bit sad at times.
B007QUUIEA|5.0|Made me think about life and choices and perspectives. A very introspective and thought provoking novel. Definitely worth the read. I recommend it to anyone!
1936608618|4.0|For years the fitness industry has thrived on a \\"complicate to profit\\" model, in which so-called professionals attempt to persuade aspiring athletes or those just looking to get in shape that they need to follow some arcane, mysterious plan that exceeds the limits of their comprehension. It's turned into a bit of a shark tank, and one could easily be misled into doing either ineffective or worse, destructive training. Power Speed Endurance cuts through the BS and delivers exhaustive, exacting, and effective analysis of the skills and techniques required for swimming, biking, and running. While this isn't necessarily revolutionary, given that Colm O'Connell has been coaching runners in Kenya with an emphasis on sharpening their technique, and both Arthur Lydiard and Percy Cerutty worked with their athletes on running more effectively (each coach trained innumerable World & Olympic champions), it's been a long time since anyone's made this the centerpiece of their philosophy. And I've never seen such a thorough collection of all the drills, skills, and analysis of what works and what doesn't as MacKenzie and his team have compiled here. As an avid endurance athlete who's been fortunate to work with coaches who understand the technical side, I can say unequivocally that this book gives spectacular, easily-followed advice that will make you faster and spare you from injury. Get the iPad or print version, because you'll want access to all the pictures and diagrams--they are excellent. It is comprehensive, deeply researched, and presented brilliantly and vividly.<br /><br />While I don't agree that CrossFit Endurance's emphasis on WODs and intervals are optimal for improving performance in any endurance sport, they're still far better than the unstructured approach many people wind up taking. It's pretty well-established--despite what many CrossFit acolytes might argue, though some have toned it down lately--that properly paced \\"long slow distance\\" training, periodized and punctuated with hard intervals and anaerobic work produces the best results. Stephen Seiler's meta-study on endurance athletes across the major sports (running, cycling, swimming, rowing, Nordic skiing) demonstrates as much. And in my own experience, that was certainly the case because I didn't start winning races against higher-level athletes until I upped the volume and got smart about the intensity. But not everyone really has that sort of time, or desire, to do that much volume. Thus, for someone who's been doing nothing but long \\"medium hard\\" runs and rides, who rarely if ever does any meaningful anaerobic work, CrossFit Endurance will deliver results. It works best for those who've established something of an aerobic base. Of course, it's not like an elite-level athlete won't benefit either. Many endurance athletes are structurally imbalanced or simply not strong enough, and CFE provides a framework to correct yourself and improve that's better than pretty much anything else.<br /><br />Bottom line? If you'd like to get faster, and get stronger, buy this book, read it, and keep it as reference. If you're an elite or aspiring elite, you'll still have to do the volume, but improving your skills and getting stronger will go a long way for you.<br /><br />My background: Masters-level rower, 2011 bronze medal in the single scull at the Masters National Championships, casual triathlete, avid track cyclist, cyclocross & criterium racer.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game because I like to build city's and also the it keep playing when you are not. It keeps me coming. Back to see what I can do on it. So if you like building games and have a kindle fire. This is game for you

B009LL4LMM|5.0|This a fun and cute app. Runs well with no issues. The graphics are nice and the gamplay is fun and simple for all ages. Would recommend if you like puzzles.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great game, and it has excellent graphics. I really love playing this and its quite addicting too!
B0001AP12G|5.0|This CD is a classic. I respect Kanye West as a rapper.I can listen to this CD from start to finish. This CD displays the raw version of Kanye West as a rapper. Overall, I enjoy this CD. This CD talks about how it is like going to college.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I was lucky enough to see this film twice in the theatre, thanks to the Wall Street Journal review.  Since them, I couldn't count how many times I've seen the movie on computer & airplane.<br /><br />This is one of the top 10 animes; I'd happily debate/defend that comment.<br /><br />The story is equal to that of written literature (is that redundant?).  Characterization & theme equal to literature.  Do I repeat myself?<br /><br />So... I've got a \\"highly sensitive\\" five and a half-year-old daughter who is far more sensitive than I was at that age.  We watched this movie together with no issues (other than assuring her that nothing bad would happen), and I'm very happy to sit down & watch the movie with her at a moment's notice.<br /><br />This movie is a joy -- positive messages, nothing objectionable, and no unnecessary hype (which nowadays is difficult to find).  Compare this movie to, say, the sarcastic garbage that is the \\"Shrek\\" franchise and I'm sure you'll see what I mean.
0802473156|5.0|This book is very helpful whether you're married, engaged, dating, single and thinking about being in a relationship with someone.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I rented this movie during hurricane Sandy, mostly because I wanted something to help keep my mind off the impending storm. It was cute, Channing did a good job showing us his previous skills and I couldn't help but think during some scenes his wife must be very happy!<br /><br />Don't watch this expecting a grand, deep, provocative movie, but rather something that's fun, light and with a side of buns.<br /><br />Ps. Matthew Mcconaughey although looked great, played a character I didn't care for.
030758836X|4.0|I just finished all 3 of her books. Gone Girl was the easiest read and not quite as dark as the other two. I couldnt put \\"Gone Girl\\" down, but it had the weakest ending. My least favorite was \\"Sharp Objects\\" altho I enjoyed the book. Reading about cutters is not that interesting for me. Altho if you want to climb inside a cutter's head to read why they do it - you may find it compelling. \\"Dark Places\\" is the \\"darkest\\" of the three books. But, for me, the best.
0743297334|3.0|This novel, more a novella, did not meet my expectations, especially being aware that Hemingway considered it his most accomplished book. There is too much dialogue, he is not \\"at his best\\" in his descrption of the fishing day in Basque country, or the Basque country, or the bull-fights. His novel comes off, as a character in A Moveable Feast told him of his Literature, too, skinny, too sinewy. Also, it is brutally anti-semitic.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I absolutely love pretty little liars! It is a very interesting show full of suspense and keeps you on the edge of your seat every scene. I recommend this to every one to watch.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|I expected a movie about strippers to be a little raunchy but within the first 2minutes I saw more boobs, butts and frontal areas than I cared to see so i turned it off. CRAZY people let their kids go and watch this! Not my vote
B000F8O35U|5.0|Great product, great movie. This is a must to have in your Disney collection. It shipped very fast and arrived when expected.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  The publishing houses are cringing in fear!  Pass thus on to your friends.  Can't wait for the next series.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Add to a Grisham goodie list! The plor was a twisting and intertwing. you won't be able to put the book down.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love the folk infusion with this brit rock band. Everyone in the band is extremely talented, playing multiple instruments. The CD came fast but was in a paper cover- oh well the music is worth it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 of Walking Dead is the best season yet! I do not miss an episode and highly recommend anybody not watching this series to start now, if you are a zombie fanatic.
B0090YHSFC|3.0|This game is more of a game of patience than skill. For that reason alone it can be frustrating and annoying. The music doesn't he was one bit with its very repetitive structure. It's worth playing but mute it and have lots of time to sit and wait the game out.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was riveted with the  many twists and turns in the novel.  I was trying to figure out how it would end.  The ending left me wondering how Nick and Amy would reconcile their relationship.  The ending left me hanging.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|for some reason my daughter loves this movie...while I might not be as enthusiastic...it did have some pretty hysterical scenes, usually involving the men of the film
0486266885|5.0|We bought this to replace the copy my son bought for school and then misplaced. I was worried that it would be abridged but it is the complete text, and inexpensive enough that, should you wish to, you could write &#34;How true!&#34; over all the margins and not care a bit.
1451638450|5.0|...and then I fell of my chair. I like regular Bujold but it's nice to have a central character, indeed more than one, who doesn't want anything more than a quiet life and would really like their hidden depths to remain hidden. Watching Ivan being dragged kicking and screaming into intrigue, matrimony and love (in that order) deal with his relatives (both old and new) and accidentally doing some major property damage (at one point I ran around my living room laughing like a maniac) was the most fun I've had with a book for ages.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have been searching for a simple but perfect calculater with big, bold and bright numbers and I found it.  GREAT APP....I give it 5 stars!!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game was chosen because it is very similar to the card game. It is very easy to use, has helpful hints and you can undo your moves. You can also increase the level of difficulty. You can also check you stats to see how you're progressing. I would recommend it to young and old alike.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|IMO, the Walking Dead is the best TV show I've seen in the past few years.  This is not due to the zombies, makeup artists or special effects, but because of the powerfully honestly humanity the characters display each and every episode.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|While part of the story in the middle dragged somewhat it all came together in the end.  Since I read novels for pure enjoyment I don't try to look for evey little flaw.  This was a good read with good characters -- it keep me guessing as to the eventual outcome.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Works great on my galaxy tab 2. Didn't have any issues. Ice is cool man, like chillin. How about a chainsaw sound when cutting the ice
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I stumbled upon 'The Redbreast' in a friend's book collection in South Korea. Because it is difficult to find good English reading in Korea, I would read anything I could find. I was hooked on Nesbo's plot from the first page and have since read every one of the Harry Hole series. I am so impressed by the complexity of the plot and characters, the unpredictable twists of each story and the absolute brilliance of Don Bartlett's translation. I obviously haven't read the original scripts but if they are anything like Bartlett's translations, Nesbo is a modern literary genius. I cannot recommend his work enough. I hope the books never stop coming.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Okay to pass the time. The longer you play, the more strategic the game can get. I usually don't download games that promote buying tokens, in this case coins. But, you can get far in this game without having to shell out any of your own coin, and its fun!

B0041KVW2K|2.0|While the remastering job on this box set is quite nice, the pressing done on albums released in the US is very hit or miss. A significant number of the ablums in my set display \\"no-fill\\" problems. Google - \\"no-fill\\" vinyl records. This will present itself as periodic bursts of scratches or areas of increased surface noise as the record is played. If you hold the album in the light you will often see a \\"string of pearls\\" pattern on the record surface. Nearly half of the records in my set had pressing problems so bad I have to return them. Records produced now should have very little surface noise and on many of these records without problems you have none - making the poorly pressed ones stand out even more! A big THANK YOU to Amazon for having such a great return policy and a nod to Sean Magee who did a great job remastering these albums. The people in the US involved in the pressing of this set should review some of their QC policies as the European manufactured pressing appear to be outstanding!<br /><br />Tom

B007IXWL2C|2.0|I only read the series to find out what the stir was about. I should have stopped very early in but I felt obligated to see it through...big waste of time.

0307477479|5.0|This was without competition my favorite book of the year. I'll admit that I started it once, stopped for a few weeks, but when I picked it up again something clicked and I couldn't stop afterwards. Riveting stories, moving characters, and a fluency with language that is so enjoyable. An incredible achievement and deserving of all the praise and awards!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love this series!  Came in mail less than 2 days after I purchased it.  Watched the whole season in just a couple days.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|the filming of the act was raw and almost amateur in appearance with cameramen walking in front of the performers at times but that just added to the feel of being in a Chicago blues bar as contrasted with the overhyped and over done productions of todays pop stars.  This felt real
B0089XH38M|5.0|AVG is reliable on your pc, tablet, or android. They gain nothing by give you less protection for free so be confident that you are protected by their full library of android bug and virus signatures.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|It's nice to see someone that's been around as long as Donald Fagen still doing what he does best instead of trying to feed the masses ( see Lionel Richie ). \\"Condos\\" is laced with typical Fagen vibes; a mesh of jazz, rock, reggae, and soul. the remake of Isaac hayes' \\"out of the ghetto\\" is one of the highlight tracks. i've read a couple other reviews that link his three previous solo albums together as a trilogy. i never got that impression. they all stood out on their own and this one holds serve beautifully. if you are a fan you will dig it.<br />[[ASIN:B000002KXV The Nightfly]]
B00005YUFK|5.0|This is my first purchase of his album. All the songs in this album are very enjoyable. Best buy for me!
B008WCP2KG|5.0|This movie is every thing A Lady wants in a Man... But knows she will never have one in REAL LIFE... But To DREAM Of Channing Tatum and a few of the other men in the movie is well worth the watch...
B008SOS63S|5.0|I usually don't like live albums when there are guest performers.  This one is the exception to the rule.  The three guest artists contribute amazingly well to to beautiful gift of music.  Joe has a smooth way of playing the blues.  The opening song is played acoustically and then boom, hits the second song running.  I especially like the live version of Sinners Prayer with Beth Heart.  I anxiously await their second album which I read will start being recorded sometime in January.
B008RZF2I0|4.0|Regarding Silverthorn, a lot of people have said that Karevik sounds \\"too much like Kahn\\".  I was lucky enough to see Kamelot this past September when they came to Atlanta, and the \\"sounds alike\\" sentiment cannot be overstated.  I was actually in the stands, cheering, and yelling, \\"Kahn!\\" when the guy sitting next to me put me in my place:  \\"You know that's not Kahn, right?\\"<br /><br />Oops.<br /><br />I forgive myself this faux pas, however, because it's true.  And while I absolutely LOVE Silverthorn, it's the songs where Karevik SOUNDS like Karevik that really stand out to me.  Not to discount the wonderful \\"Sacrimony (Angel of Afterlife)\\" (watch the video!!), but my favorite tracks include \\"Torn\\", \\"Song for Jolee\\", \\"My Confession\\", \\"Falling Like The Fahrenheit\\", and \\"Prodigal Son\\".<br /><br />I am okay if my review comes across as biased; with a pen name like \\"mercyfalls\\", it's obvious where I stand on the Seventh Wonder / Kamelot comparison.  But calling me a Seventh Wonder fanboy would be doing a disservice to the love I have for that band in that the strength of the statement doesn't nearly capture the place Seventh Wonder holds in my heart.  So while I'd RATHER have had a fifth Seventh Wonder album, Silverthorn is a good replacement, and if Karevik can be more like himself vocally for the subsequent Kamelot endeavors, and if he CONTINUES his work with Seventh Wonder, I will have no complaints.<br /><br />If, like me, you've been less than impressed by some of Kamelot's recent offerings, take this to heart:  this is the best Kamelot album in a long, long time.  Your question shouldn't be, \\"Should I buy it?\\" but rather, \\"Am I willing to pay extra to have it shipped to me faster?\\":)
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Books are always vast compared to a film version, so it is often the case that movies fall short in a comparison (there are exceptions). It becomes almost impossible for a movie, however, when the source material is as vast as this story.  That said Grahame-Smith does better than most in cutting the book (his own) down for the big screen, keeping in mind that the book was appealing (at least to me) because of the actual details of Lincolns life seen through the blood colored glasses of the vampire plot line, and that those grounding details which wove the far-out into the historical mostly got the axe (pun intended) ... and there is the rub.  The acting was fine, the special effects were good to great, but the story, which made the book worth reading, takes the full force of the adaptation in the neck and is at risk of becoming, at best just another vampire movie, and at worst a silly joke.  I don't think it ever sinks to the latter, but I am afraid it doesn't ever escape from being the former.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Brings back fond memories of being a kid playing this game for hours at the pizza restaurant.  Still very addicting:)
B009H442DG|1.0|Music is officially dead. This is nearly as bad as Avril Lavigne and Chad Kroeger breeding. Ugh. Cat farts and baby splats.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|It is great for all ages.  The movie was viewed during Hurricane Sandy.  My kids were able to be distracted and so was I.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Its a really good book you should get it but to me it was as habit short probably because I read fast
B009KYXEY6|3.0|I really love Lana Del Rey and I love every song on this album, I listen to every song on repeat most days.<br />The reasoning behind my 3 star rating is because when I got my copy it was part of the batch that had missing tracks on the disc, but other than that it is an amazing album.
B00914JWSW|5.0|The music was so different from Barbara's other albums. Some were well known and others not. She always amazes me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love to play while running on the treadmill or riding my spinnning bike....makes the time go faster and I forget I'm sweating and tired!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I certainly enjoy reading John Grisham books and the Racketeer is no exception.  It is very interesting and keeps your attention with all the action and details.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Can't wait for the movie! I really was hoping it was s book that was going to be more along the lines of the way the movie trailer looks.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|As soon as I finished this book I went back to Amazon to see if this author had written anything else!! Very compelling and a real page turner. The book paints the scene so well you can put yourself right in India with all its sights and smells.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great book, read this one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another good sequel!  Keeps you on your toes as you travel through the obstacles which appeared.  Looking forward to the next edition.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Realizing I had never read anything by Charles Dickens, I decided to take a crack at this novella after I found it being offered for free on Amazon. If you've seen any of the dozens of adaptations of this classic, you know the story: A cruel miser is visited by ghosts of past, present and future on Christmas Eve and given a glimpse of the misery he has and will continue to cause if he doesn't change his ways.<br /><br />As far as the Dickensian style goes, I can see the reasons why it is both loved and hated. At times the tone is conversational, like Dickens is standing in front of you telling the story, which is something you're either going to love or hate. At times I got a little lost in the text, but I just see that as a byproduct of reading a book that was written in a very different time and place.<br /><br />That said, the themes are very familiar, especially in today's political climate. Scrooge's dialogue in the opening scene could easily be adapted for one of the talking heads of Fox News. I'm not trying to get political here. Scrooge is a worst case scenario cartoon rendering of a heartless rich guy, but then again, I feel like he sees the error of his ways just a little too easily.<br /><br />At the end of the day, what you have in A Christmas Carol is a modern fable, and unlike many cultural myths, the original text is here for your enjoyment and analysis. This book is responsible in large part for how we experience and imagine Christmas today, so the cultural themes are vital. It's also a short read, so you won't lose a lot of time seeing if you like it.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is Susans best album to date, her choice of songs are wonderful and she sounds better than ever. There's not one song on this album I do not like and a couple of my favorites are \\"Out Here On My Own\\", \\"Memory\\" and \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\".
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love using the app to share on my Kindle Fire.  A great way to share.  No problems thus far, but I've not had issues with my Kindle apps or Pinterest.
098478280X|5.0|Great Practice for interviews! If you are in computer science and you want to practice for interviews for a big company this book is a must!
B0086700CM|3.0|So i got this app it was fine no problems until now it wont let me tilt to move sides to i end up dying not long after i start the gameb
B00A3AU1U6|5.0|I LOVE this album and have been waiting with baited breath for a return to form.<br /><br />\\"Lux\\" falls in with \\"Neroli\\" and \\"Thursday Afternoon,\\" is autumnal in tone and would work nicely in headphones while sitting in and/or strolling through a sunlit cemetery that's bursting with foliage in the very early afternoon hours of a day off from work.<br /><br />Though past outings such as \\"Drums Between the Bells\\" and \\"Small Craft on A Milk Sea\\" explore DIFFERENT sides of his muse, it's always been his more ambient efforts which have afforded me the opportunity to actually \\"listen\\" to myself.<br /><br />I'm a hospital switchboard operator, so you can only imagine how my ears THIRST for THIS KIND of ear candy after an 8-hour shift of marathon-speaking, thinking, processing and typing.  Thank you, Brian!  :-)
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I love vevo because it gives you all the REAL music and tells you all the new videos so may I tell you, VEVO IS AMAZING!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it. It's was very nice and feels nice, it was fast and I would recommend it to everyone
B007R3AZNK|1.0|I'm a long time Joe fan and I love his raw, honest talent. In fact, I was handing out flyers to individuals, getting thank you's from his managers for my help, years ago.  But this CD is a huge disappointment, like he's sold out.  I sure hope it's a fluke.  There's no passion, no spark, it's lacking any real, raw feelings that I'm use to hearing in his voice and guitar playing!  He's an amazing musician and yet, can have a bad album, so I'm not going to hold this against him. But I just hope that his next one is back to the passion filled album I'm use to from him!
B005IA9JZO|5.0|This movie is realy good i know is old but is the best for me i hope you like it.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I recommend. This game to anyone who likes games that make you think and like sudoku. I'm surprised my brother likes it as well and he is 11
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|Honestly, I have no idea where everyone's ill strife is coming from! Regarding change, it is in human nature to fight it, so I completely understand why people would suddenly be up in arms when a band that they love, for example, scream a little less. Anyway, after \\"A Thousand Suns,\\" all of you should have been prepared for absolutely ANYTHING from this band; it's kind of like when The Beatles started doing drugs and completely changed their sound to reflect whatever the heck they wanted. I think that it is obnoxious to assume any reasons for what Linkin Park does with their sound. At this point, they are so huge that they have creative freedom and you simply have to appreciate that. Anyway the whole reason I started typing is counter the top reviewer's account of \\"Lies Greed Misery.\\" That track was the first to really stand out to me. The first listen felt like Chester had managed to do what no one else has manage to do: blend screaming style vocals with hip-hop/rap style. It was exciting and inspiring.<br /><br />Final note: This is art damnit!! Stop listening for what you think the music SHOULD BE and start listening to what it IS. I couldn't tell you the name of a single real artist that doesn't appreciate this album for what it is.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|The language of the book was so vivid as were the characters; I found their connections fascinating.  The way the author wove the chapters into different periods of time with a bit history that impacted the future was very well done.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This application does everything I need it to and it is free. I also enjoy the graphics and how it shows you your input history.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Best series I have ever read.  Have not been able to put the books down.  Will read them all and buy the Dvds.

141690977X|5.0|Gives a good clue to dating. Helped me a lot no more pity party and I am not wasting the pretty
B004AM5QT4|5.0|Another great read by Ken Follett.  The author kept my attention riveted as the plot developed.  Anyone who wants to read a book that keeps you page turning and losing sleep, purchase The Third Twin. You will be glad you did!!!
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|I showed this movie in my class for a unit or Public Speaking. The students really enjoyed it and were prepared for thier speaking event after being inspired by the actors of this movie. I would recommend this movie to other Middle school and high school teachers. It is PG-13 and has a few uses of profanity, but it's nothing your students havnen't heard before.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I got this for Christmas alomst 2 years ago. I used it off and on quite often. Then I wasn't able to use it for about a month and we have no decided it's the battery. It will work for about 30 seconds you then have to shut it off for a minute or two and then can run it for 30 seconds again. A new battery is 20? Really I can get a competelly new one for 27?
1455519006|4.0|David Baldacci gives us THE INNOCENT where a government assassin meets runaway teenage girl and tries to help.  Well, there is soo much more.  I don't read a lot of Baldacci and I can't say I didn't enjoy Will Robie, would like to see more of him but I have trouble when the hero is against crooked FBI, cops, crooked DCIS, weak Secret Service, come on??  It takes a good story and makes in weaker in my opinion.  But the read was better than bad and I would read another story about the assassin.
0741470314|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Great read. Learned a whole different side of MJ. Kudos to the author and many thanks.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|This is a great movie and will be a new Christmas classic! Fun for all ages...even adults. Cute characters and lovable Arthur is so sweet. You won't be disappointed.
B0043JDUNS|2.0|I was not able to enjoy this movie with my HTC Flyer tablet. Amazon should notice customer that Android tablet has not supported yet. Can I expect to get a refund from Amazon? Wish I could.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This is a very good collection of songs by McCartney. The musicians involved in producing this album are all very reputable professional musicians and together with the high-quality recording at the Capitol Studios, this album is a must-have for all Jazz music lovers.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Simply unputdownable.  The best book in the series. A cliff hanger every few chapters. Looking forward to book 4 and 5
B008O69SZ0|5.0|This is a great CD! It rocks hard, has great lyrics, killer guitar playing, and classic vocals. This is so much better than most of the stuff that comes out these days. Mark Bosch is a standout on guitar, and Steve Holley wails on drums. Get this CD!
B009LL4LMM|5.0|The graphics on the game are great. There is enough of a learning curve to keep it interesting. Help your little jelly fly! This is a game that you will keep on you device, just because it is fun. I keep going back to get a prefect on the levels, so I really enjoy it.
1451627289|5.0|11/23/63 captivated me from the first page and the ending was a knockout. I been a Stephen King fan for a number of years and big history buff even longer. It was great to read a book that so expertly wove a spelling-binding plot, great characters, and the cultural and political history of the late fifties and early sixties together. As I read, I kept speculating on how history would have unfolded if JFK had not been tragically assassinated and developed my own guesses. Well, all I can say is that the final chapters made the read all the more worthwhile. This Stephen King novel was both thrilling and thought-provoking at once.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun and love the starwars reference. Too cute!  Always enjoy playing Angry Birds
0307279189|4.0|Readers I trust recommended this book and I'm glad I took their advice. Having once lived in South Texas, I've heard about the Tarahumara for years and have always wanted to learn more about them. Born to Run provides amazing insights into that mysterious tribe, but it always provides amazing insights into the human body and the capabilities within all of us. Even if you're not a runner, this book is a worthy read. It's that rare combination of an entertaining, fast paced narrative and a wealth of information, some which you may even use in your life. And it is an inspiring and uplifting story to boot!
0345803493|3.0|I read the first one out of curiosity. Still not sure what all the hype is about. Just reading it to get to the end. Would not reccommend
B008458O3S|5.0|Obtained this as an Amazon Free App of the Day, then played it until I had completed every level available.  Gary challenge, and wonderfully creative.  Great for the mind.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I seriously started to put the book down, but I'm never one to do that easily. Really glad I stayed with it. An excellent story with rich characters and enough intrigue to keep you up late to read more. Enjoy.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Ugh, way to go people who made this movie, I see your special effects and clean design, and raise you my satisfaction. Well, I'd *really* like to raise the story you pumped so many holes in from the dead, but I'm no necromancer. Or is it cinemancer in this case? Okay, I only have a few points to make:<br /><br />1. What a Great Trailer!<br />I saw a trailer many months ago. That trailer made me say out loud: \\"Now *that's* how you do a trailer!\\" And then all I could do was get excited and hope the movie would be good. Well, now my hope has been killed. Why did you kill my hope, Prometheus? What did my hope do to you? Why did you leave it mangled on the side of the road and spray it with skunk funk??<br /><br />2. What Great Special Effects!<br />Yes, if you like special effects, and will defend a movie with good special effects even if the characters contradict their own professions, motivations and the overall thrust of the story with their actions, then you might love Prometheus and rate it 4 stars or higher.  However, If you are not the aforementioned person and realize that this movie is not intended to be a madcap romp, or that Galaxy Quest had waaay tighter story and plot, then you may end up with a frown on your face. Frown on Face. F.O.F.<br /><br />3. The \\"Scientist's Survival Pop Quiz v2.0!\\" is Spot On!<br />Nuff said about the pop quiz. Look up the \\"Scientist's Survival Pop Quiz v2.0\\" by Arthur J. Bullock Jr. here on Amazon.<br /><br />4. WARNING!!! Amazon Has Spoiler Footage at the Beginning if you Stream...<br />Exactly as it reads above. If you're the type to avoid as much exposure to a film's content until you see it, you may want to beware of what appears for about 30 seconds *before* the movie begins.<br /><br />Lastly, while I'm happy with the look and feel of Prometheus, what happened, or should I say the accumulation of so many things that happened, left me feeling like I'd bitten into a stinkbug.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is very entertaining and works great. They busy need to add buckets, and monster spawners.<br />P.S P.C is still better but this is a great app. Definitely worth buying
B008RV5K4U|5.0|The fact that they got Peter Weller to lend his voice to the Dark Knight was a great touch. I cannot wait until Part 2 comes out.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It was fun jumping from different periods in time and different stories and finding in the end that they where all initmately related.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Sometimes a bit drawn out but a very interesting story about how the system works and can be manipulated.  Grisham does a wonderful job telling a story and The Rackateer proves this fact again!
B000I186FW|2.0|This is a very slow moving film with a predictable plot and unending dialogue. I was looking for something that would hold my attention and amuse me, but this was more a chore than recreational. It could have been and hour and a half instead of the two-and-a-quarter hours it was spread into. Some plot twists were interesting but not believable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book! I couldn't wait to get off from work and read.  Can't wait to read the next one.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|This game is for the person who has lots of patence. I have an Autistic 12 year old and believe me patience is on thing I have learned. Basically you are slicing for ice cubes and you can't slice the baby penquins. The penquens wonder aimlessly at a fast pase on the ice. You also have to keep them all in one area. It is a chalange but if you tap them you can get them to move in a certain direction. Of course you could have one going in the direction you want and then another will get away from you. Eventually you are able to earn power ups. You will also have opsticals to overcome besides hearding the brood in one area.<br /><br />The graphics are somple but bright enoigh to hold your attention and like everyone else says there are only a couple permissions. I got it on todays free app at Amazon. But it is a game I would pay a couple dollars for, but no more than that.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Android is the Best app for viewing eBooks, there is no comparison. The app is very easy to use, downloaded quickly, and does everything it should do.
B000HT3P7E|3.0|Overall it is in pretty good shape, but some of the episodes skip which is very disappointing since this was not mentioned in the product description.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|We humans have a lot to learn from our animals. Faithful, dependable and loving. I enjoyed it so much I never wanted it to end.
B0091REZMW|5.0|fun game. very addictive.  just wish it gave more diamonds.  snatchins are fun to banish.  rooms are pretty easy to find all items.
B005VBC7EA|4.0|Love the bib, very comfortable. But the blue hightlights are a bit too gay for me...and by gay I mean bright and  lively  :). Quite a contrast to my red Arogant Bastard jersey...It's all good.
1451638450|5.0|This is a really lovely romantic comedy, complete with likable hero and heroine, trying families, complicated situations, and a certain amount of farce.<br /><br />The really classic romantic comedy is wound tighter with  the addition of a sort-of arranged marriage or marriage of convenience, plus some heist elements, and many complications ensuing. This is great!<br /><br />There was even a subtle reference to the disastrous dinner party in \\"A Civil Campaign\\".<br /><br />I loved it and am hoping Bujold writes more about Ivan and Tej.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Kewl book. I've read them all. Really really cool. Jeff money does good, work. You should buy this for your kids
1402210086|4.0|Kitty Charing has just been told by her ward that she will inherit his fortune if she concedes to marry one of his nephews.  However, the nephew that Kitty wants to marry does not show up at his uncle's house on the day of the announcement.  Kitty would prefer to marry Jack Westruther, the nephew who does not make an appearance.<br /><br />Kitty and Freddy, another nephew, decide to have a sham engagement so that Kitty might entice Jack to offer for her and also so that she might go to London and decide her own future.  What follows is a delightful and humorous story of Kitty's attempts to help others in their own love lifes while trying to decide how to manage her own!<br /><br />This book has some truly funny moments with Freddy and Dolph the other hapless nephew who definitely does not want to marry Kitty.  All in all a great and funny read.
B004SBX112|3.0|I play all the versions of Angry Birds and have paid for each but cannot reliably preserve my scores and unlocked levels and secrets across devices or platforms. Please add the ability to backup and restore ALL game player info and progress locally and/or to the cloud. Charge me if you have to.
1451695187|3.0|I found this book to be an interesting read. The reader was given a lot<br />of factual information from the medical stand point but after the completion<br />of the book I felt a bit wanting.  I guess I had higher expectations on<br />the Spiritual Plane.Maybe hoping for a more indepth description on the Next World. Overall I would still recommend the book to readers.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|characters aren't as brilliant as Downton Abbey or Sherlock (except for Brody's family, who occasionally are fleshed out), but the running plot lines are madly addictive.  Oh and did I mention that Damian Lewis (can't believe the guy's English) is an excellent actor and not too horrible to look at?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I LIKED THE BOOK VERY MUCH.  IT WAS OFF THE BEATEN PATH AND I HAD NO IDEA HOW IT WOULD END.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I always look forward to the \\"lawyer\\" novels.  This one did not let me down!  Can't wait for the next one.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Amazing series, lots of fun and very addictive. Beautifully made, and it´s nice to see the behind-the-scenes extras . The booklet is very informative and helps to newcomers.<br />Absolutely recommended.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I've heard nothing but great reviews for this show from the media and friends and its true. It's so suspenseful!  Big thumbs up for Homeland!
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Only watch this movie if you are completely hammered. And even then it may not be worth the $5, so pick up a bag of shrooms to make this watchable.
B005K17RU0|2.0|cant get to hourly forecast.<br />doesnt automatically update, lkke other aps do, you look at it and it was say 78 but when you touch it to update its 68.<br />like other aps much better
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it
B0041KVW2K|4.0|I received my box set and have so far listened to over half of it.  I had pressing issues as other have mentioned.  I called customer service and they 2 day shipped a replacement.  Great customer service!  If anyone has issues buying this because of the quality, Amazon will have you back so you can get a perfect set.<br /><br />As far as the vinyl itself, you need to be aware that these were not made to sound like original UK 1960s pressings.  If you want that sound then buy the original albums.  This box set is for people who do not have UK pressings and looking to get them in one set.  You should also know that the volume is quite a bit lower than original pressings.  They used 24/44.1 files WITHOUT limiting.  Turning the volume up will improve the sound some.  Having most of the original UK albums and other ones from around the world, I have heard details in the music I had never heard before.  Not having heard the original master tapes, I could only imagine this is the closest thing to being able to hear them.  Hearing new details in the music is worth the price for me.<br /><br />The sleeves and labels are not 100% reproductions.  I will say the artwork is very clear and great to look at.  Some may think the sleeves are too flimsy; I do not have a big issue with them.  I only have three complaints.  I wish they would have kept Beatles for Sale closer to the original by having the disk load from inside the gatefold sleeve.  Likewise, I wish The Beatles (White Album) was a top loader like the original.  They did a good job making the inner sleeves black for the white album and beyond, but I was hoping that they would have reproduced the EMTEX sleeves.  As far as the book included, no complaints here.  I enjoyed looking through it.<br /><br />This box set is not for everyone, but is certainly is not a waste of money.  If you have many of the original UK albums, you may not want this, however if you are new to Beatles vinyl (or only have US copies) this is a greatset.  Don't let all the negativity stop you from getting this.

B00005U122|4.0|Roger try's to continue the Floyd story on his own. There are some excellent reproductions of some of my favourite PF  numbers from Animals. Roger has a good backup band and the Dual guitarists Snowy White and Doyle do well and are excellent guitarists in their own right imitating DG's rifts. Of note is the Synth player/Acoustic Guitar/Steel Guitar Jon Carin, He does an excellent number from Animals. The Organ/Synth player is also good and of course RW on Bass.<br /><br />Of course RW's later songs kind of drag, they are just missing a kind of focus.<br /><br />I think DG, RW and NM did so much for his music, more than he realizes or gives them credit for.<br /><br />It's a shame he didn't perform Grantchester Meadows which I personally think was one of his best numbers.<br />However of note:-<br />Excellent Set Your Controls..., and some of my favourite of RW's numbers are the one's from Animals, Welcome to the Machine is also a highlight.<br /><br />Overall a good performance as RW pays attention to detail.

B00006LI4S|5.0|Looks like David wanted to get away from the Floyd Pomp that began after their success with the Dark Side of the Moon and carried them into a marketing hodge podge of pretense such as floating animals and the like.<br /><br />A good selection of songs played surprisingly on Electric-Acoustic guitar which he seems to favour. He has an excellent back-up band and brings many of the Floyd songs down to earth.<br /><br />Quite a nice set but could have been longer. Wish You Were Here and several other classics have nice rendering with an excellent bassist. A nice guest appearance by Richard Wright. It is a shame as far I know he did not tour his solo album which may be the better of all the PF solo CD's. David Gilmour's willingness to give way to Richard Wright for one of his numbers and his excellent Guitar on it is a highlight.<br /><br />All in all a very good Live Performance.

B000OVLBFS|5.0|this movie was taken from the first book written about Jesse Stone, although it was the 2nd film , but Tom Selleck makes them all good and they should be watched and shared over and over.

1608871517|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations by far ! Cover ,paper and pictures are of best Quality ;not for a shelf !<br />I would say ,it is a coffee-table book. Michael Bush did a fantastic job ,not only when he worked for MJ ; but also to  show the world this artwork of clothing . We know that many Fashion designer especially today are influenced by MJ`s Style .<br />This book makes everybody happy who is interested in Fashion and,or Michael jackson
B007SGLZP8|2.0|My favorite author has finally writen a real bummer.  He barely keeps your attention but you feel he will make it all worthwhile at the end with some sort of suprise twist.  Not so. In fact in the authors notes, Grisham admits that he spent very little time on research.<br /><br />I'll buy his next book simply because I have enjoyed most of his others so much, but this was not one of them.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was looking for a new game and decided to try this.  It's addicting and the best part is it was free.  So far not bothered with 80 million ads.
1416905014|5.0|This was the first pop-up book we bought for our 6 month old.  Reinhart is a master paper engineer.  Our now toddler still loves this book and it is a favorite at home.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Very disappointing and even more disturbing that this book hit a best sellers list. It makes me worried about the mentality of our community who thinks its entertaining for a domineering rich man to violate a innocent young woman. It also makes me wonder who really wrote this book...the author or her husband. What healthy woman welcomes abuse regardless of how beautifully or wealthy it is packaged.  can only guess how the next two books read: Grey finds he can't live without Ana; Ana's &#34;inner-godess&#34; can't help but see the goodness trapped deep in Grey's soul and thinks she can change him; Grey slowly comes around and maybe by book three finally makes love to Ana; Ana triumphant she has changed the man she loves into what she needs, they live happily-ever-after. This is not a romance story in my opinion and one that I will never encourage anybody I know to read. Complete waste of my valuable time. :(
B003L77TZI|5.0|I started off buying one song at a time on this CD and before I knew it I had almost the whole CD.  Just save the time and money and buy the whole CD, it's worth it.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|****SPOLIERS****<br /><br />It was incredible. It was dynamic. It was over too soon. The historical accuracy of getting married for purposes other than love was well done. I'm sure a lot of women did not want to get married or were just as free-spirited, but when it came down to it, you got married because you loved your family and inter-group peace and/or alliances are important. Even better was the fact that at no point did Merida have a romantic interest. Even once she learns of past kingdoms torn, she doesn't just all of a sudden fall for a guy and jump in the marriage saddle.<br /><br />And I LOVED that the movie was about a girl who did not dream of getting married when she grew up. The pressure, both culturally and religiously, to get married is immense. So to have a heroine that bucks the getting married dream? Not the tired old 'I don't want to get married to this guy because I don't love him' or ' I don't want to get married yet', but straight up, not interested in marriage- \\"I'll be shooting for my own hand!\\" Heck yeah!!<br /><br />The relationship between mother and daughter was pretty incredible as well. The protective instincts that they developed for each other is exactly what I want with my mom some day. Were we ever best friends, no. But we know, no matter what, that we will be there for each other. And really, family is the most important thing. It is a lasting and growing love.<br /><br />And the witch. Hilarious and super cool that she wasn't trotted out as black and white evil. Which is another totally awesome thing about the movie. Even the evil guy wasn't that evil. He made mistakes. And they were costly. How great is a fairy tale that captures good choices and bad choices by people rather than just portraying good people and bad people?!?! Loved it! :)
B00633W614|5.0|[[ASIN:B00633W614 The Sins of the Father (The Clifton Chronicles)]]<br />I will begin by saying that I love reading Jeffrey Archer.  I got hooked with AS THE CROW FLIES. This was an exciting book from the first book, ONLY TIME WILL TELL and then this one.  Had I realized it was a series I would have waited for the 3rd book to order this now I must wait until May, 2013 to find out what happens.  O' well.  Enjoyed both immensely and have pre-ordered the 3rd book.

0316228532|1.0|At my time of writing this review, about 1700 other reviews have been forwarded. I have noticed over the last few months that the rating of a casual vacancy has been falling.<br />Like many, I bought the book to see if Rowling could keep up the \\"magic\\" in her writing. She doesn't and perhaps she cann't.<br />This is a rather turgid novel and might have made a decent short story. She populates the town/village with perhaps too many characters - a list and their relationships at the beginning wou8ld have helped a good deal.<br />This title is bound for the remainder table.
B0091LRZZW|1.0|First up, I'm a huge Beatle fan and a huge McCartney fan. I saw Paul play the song \\"My Valentine\\" on the Grammy Awards. He was accompanied by the very talented and lovely Diana Krall, among other great players. Even she couldn't save him. It was horrible. This album is horrible and belongs in a little rack near the cash register at Starbucks.
B001EC2ISA|3.0|Although this movie initially appears family-friendly, it certainly is not for the young, or children who are easily frightened. It has a fair amount of gore and frightening concepts (namely death), does not depict a view of what happens after we die that most families would subscribe to, and includes multiple sexual innuendos.  On the other hand, the acting is amusing, and the music enjoyable.  Possible good entertainment for \\"tweens\\" and older.  Those of us who remember it when it first came out will still enjoy it, but may not remember how inappropriate it was.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Christina's new album is amazing. Any real Christina fan will appreciate this album. My absolute favorite track is Just a Fool but I also love Blank Page, Army of Me, Make the World Move (the whole album is fantastic!)

B004VYYA2K|5.0|I got this for my little niece's 4th birthday.  She loved it.  When all the sides are zipped up it makes a cool Barbie storage box, and when 3 of the sides are unzipped it's a cute little pretend house. The lid turned upside down makes a pretend pool. It made the perfect gift because she needed something to put her Barbies in and her bedroom is decorated in zebra stripes and hot pink.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I could not stop reading this book. It did not even take a week.  After reading the first book I could not wait for the second. Now I have a long wait till the third. Disappointed at how long I have to wait to be honest. I loved it and would recommend it to friends. :)

0618918248|3.0|PROS: Dawkins argument is very well architected, constructed and crafted. He's clearly spent a great deal of time thinking about theology and has crafted his atheist response with great care.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, he's most confident as a writer when covering scientific subjects, but overall his writing is very clear and straightforward<br /><br />Very good compendium on the messes that religions have often made of human societies, and how religiosity too easily slides into emotional plague, mania and sadism.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Dawkins comes across as a bit snarky. Gleeful to massacre any and every sacred cow possible, he doesn't seem to have a lot of compassion for religious humans, or perhaps humans in general.<br /><br />I was surprised to see that his conceptions of divinity seemed so centered on \\"old bearded guy in the sky\\" Sunday-school cliches. I bet if he studied more mysticism he'd find some common ground with religionism.<br /><br />SO IS GOD DEAD?<br />Atheists and agnostics will find useful facts and arguments in The God Delusion<br /><br />For religious people, The God Delusion is also useful as a reference point for developing counter-arguments or as something to ponder to deepen one's own faith.
B005COO1X6|5.0|No one writes real, believable, flawed people better than Stephen King.  This story proves that King is also genius at capturing the voice of young boys in all their mixed up priorities, wide eyed curiosity, and base acceptance of what is in front of their eyes.<br /><br />Pete wanted to prove to his brother's bike gang that he was a big kid too.  Falling asleep in the abandoned Burger King that was the focal point of the old Mile 81 rest stop was supposed to be the last event of a magical day that included a little breaking & entering, some leering at skin mags, a one person darts game, and a close first encounter with vodka.  That's before the mud splattered car crashed through the barrier of the old rest stop and sat there, omimously.  Waiting.<br /><br />Unbelievable circumstances draw Pete to test his wits against an unknown entity.  It's a coming of age story crossed with a supernatural event so odd that it comes full circle to awesome.  King gives the characters, adults and children, meaningful nuances that flesh them out into people you might run into walking down the street.  Just hope the street isn't near the Mile 81 rest stop.  If you see an abandoned car, keep walking or driving by.  On this street it doesn't pay to be a Good Samaritain.

1400063736|4.0|I was thrilled to receive an advance reader's copy of LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN three and a half years ago but somehow it never made it to the top of my \\"to be read\\" pile until this week.  I have always been fascinated by New York City and Irish writer Colum McCann does a good job describing both the place and the very specific time period in which the novel takes place.  He tells his slice of life story from the viewpoint of several very diverse people who are somehow connected to each other on August 7, 1974 the day a young Frenchman walked across a tightrope spanning the two world trade center towers.  A saintly Irish member of a religious order, his visiting brother, a couple of Bronx prostitutes, some moms mourning the losses of their sons in Viet Nam, the judge who arraigns the tightrope walker and an artist from a wealthy family who has squandered much of her twenties on drugs and wild parties are some of the most memorable characters who are all interconnected in surprising ways.  McCann is able to give credible voices to these people including three African American women.  I also like the way McCann uses a very specific real life incident to anchor the stories of his fictional characters.  And McCann has a lot to say about social justice and problems that still exist in American society.  Yet I still feel this ambitious book doesn't quite live up to what it could have been.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Ordered all the Dexter seasons from you because I didn't have the Showtime station but had seen the first season on regular tv during a writer's strike, so decided to get the first season from you as well - now have the complete set to present and I will also order this year's season when it becomes available and pass it around to family and friends who don't get the Showtime station either.  I'm doing the same with Boardwalk Empire - ordered and received the first two from you as well and the third which is now being aired will get when it is available, as I don't get HBO either so it's nice to have these available to purchase.

B003JTHWPA|4.0|A placid southern town is revealed to be torn by intense passions as McCullers takes us into the consciousness of several of its poor and lower middle-class citizens. The girl Mick Kelly comes of age (at 15), a radical drifter is defeated once again in his efforts to make the \\"Don't knows\\" understand how they're oppressed, the owner of the all-night New York Caf&eacute; watches it all, and the town's sole black physician finally bursts the dam of a lifetime of rage against white injustice. All these people confide in the sympathetic deaf-mute, believing he alone can understand them ­ but he doesn't, and he in turn attributes such deep understanding of his own emotions to a fat, self-centered deaf-mute moron. It is the black physician Dr. Benedict Mady Copeland who is the novel's most thoroughly imagined character besides Mick, who must be a version of McCullers herself, who was only 24 when this first novel appeared.
0316044695|3.0|This book is not bad, but also not good.<br /><br />Mr. Luttrell recounts his heroic battle in great detail.  This part of the book is very good -- it doesn't appear that he has edited the story to make himself or his teammates seem even more heroic than they really were.  He spends many, many pages on how much his fellow SEALs meant to him.  Clearly he has written this book in homage to them.<br /><br />The lack of a covered route between the drop zone and the ambush site made his entire team very nervous about this operation before it began.  The book could have used some better explanation here.<br /><br />The operation is blown when the SEAL team is discovered by a trio of young goat herders.  They have no rope or zip ties to immobilize the kids, which I found astonishing.  They consider but reject shooting them, which they consider militarily justified but morally unacceptable, and Mr. Luttrell casts the deciding vote.  This is a really key point in the book, and Mr. Luttrell clearly takes away a different lesson than I did.<br /><br />He feels that, had they shot the kids, his buddies would have lived significantly longer, and perhaps gotten out alive.  He points out that had they shot the kids and hidden the bodies, the goats would still have been a giveaway and the missing kids would have prompted a manhunt within the day.<br /><br />Significantly, even though it appears they made the decision not to shoot the kids because it was immoral, Mr. Luttrell blames western media and politicians for their decision.  Had they shot the kids, they might have been charged with murder, and he feels this is wrong.  That may be so, but his account makes it seem that this factor wasn't what drove his decision and therefore cannot be to blame.<br /><br />Mr. Luttrell does attempt to explain the lokhay warkawal concept.  Apparently a Pashtun named Sarawa decides to offer him help, which then obligates the entire town of Sabray to defend him to the death against the Taliban.They eventually send a village elder to walk dozens of miles to a nearby base with a note, and the elder's son ends up sneaking out of the village, staring down dozens of armed Taliban, to get the author to a group of Rangers who are searching for him.  This saves our author's life.<br /><br />At the end of the book, Mr. Luttrell has words of thanks for the many Americans who helped him, but none for Sarawa, Gulab, or Gulab's father (the elder of the village Sabray).  This seems astonishing.  I kept expecting some kind of note at the end describing precautions that had been taken by the military to protect the village of Sabray from the Taliban, in exchange for their pledge of lokhay warkawal.  Nothing.<br /><br />I am left grateful to Mr. Luttrell for his service, and for writing a book which details what we ask of our soldiers.  But I'm also left feeling that something has not been learned.

B009KHDT0C|5.0|For a movie with a vampire in it was rather moderately paced compared to most vampire films, but it's less about a vampire action, & more drama. With a few laughs thrown in. I rented this from Amazon. Amazon really needs to add sub-titles to it's streaming service. Also, I would like to stream a movie the same way I view a DVD. As in it loads up like a DVD. Complete with trailers & extras like a DVD would. Overall, it's a movie I would recomend.

1401937519|3.0|I appreciated Anita Moorjani's account of her NDE, but otherwise I wasn't crazy about this book, and I find some of its teachings at best factually incorrect, and at worst, dangerous.<br /><br />Anita Moorjani is a lovely human being. In her videos on youtube and in the glancing interactions I've witnessed on the web, she is unfailingly giving, open, generous of herself and her time, and eager to be of service to humanity. Some gurus have an air of smarm about them, boosting their own egos at their followers' expense. Some seem too quick to make a buck. Some are harsh and humiliate those who follow them. Anita Moorjani is a genuine and enthusiastic lady who is helping others because that is her path.<br /><br />\\"Dying to Be Me\\" has provided profound hope, liberation, and possibly even healing to hundreds, if not thousands of readers. Many of those readers have taken the inspiration they received from this book and used it to spread love and support to others.<br /><br />Anita Moorjani is of Hindu, Indian descent. She was born in Singapore and raised in Hong Kong. She was diagnosed with cancer and came within hours of what her doctors assumed would be an inevitable death.<br /><br />At that point, Anita had what she has referred to as a Near Death Experience, but what could more accurately be referred to as an out-of-body experience. Unlike others who have NDEs, Anita did not actually die. She entered a coma.<br /><br />Anita encountered her deceased father and her friend Soni, who had died of cancer. She also experienced ESP, spontaneously accessing the thoughts and conversations of widely dispersed friends, family, and physicians. After her OBE, Anita experienced a spontaneous remission of her cancer.<br /><br />What didn't work for me in Anita's book was the insistence that several postulates are true, postulates that I don't see any evidence to support.<br /><br />Anita reports that we are all God, and if you don't like the word \\"God\\" you can say Source or Allah or Brahma or any other word. We all create the universe. We attract into our lives the events we desire. We exercise control over illnesses like cancer. There is no difference between good and bad. There is no punishment in the afterlife. Duality is a bad thing. Religion is a bad thing because its prominent influence is to cause people to kill each other. We should do what makes us happy. Service should not be done out of duty, only if it makes us feel good.<br /><br />Too, Anita takes a few subtle swipes at Christianity and Western civilization. The nuns who taught her are subtly put down, as is Mother Teresa. English, as a language, is said to be so lacking that her NDE can't be communicated; cancer is a Western disease.<br /><br />Anita makes no attempt to foist these ideas on anyone. Unfortunately some have adopted these ideas as dogma, and insist that they are the only truth. By what authority? Anita has been to heaven, these folks insist; therefore, she must be correct.<br /><br />As it happens, though, many people have had NDEs at this point, and not everyone agrees with Anita. People do come back from the dead and report the punishment and judgment that Anita and her followers insist never occurs. Some have had NDEs of Hell, and insist on this emphatically. Others encounter Jesus, and return to human life with a greater conviction than ever that Jesus is savior.<br /><br />Some of these ideas, when carried to extremes - and people do carry them to extremes - are spiritually toxic. No, I am NOT God, and neither are you. Admitting that we are not God is one of the first steps in psychological maturity, and spiritual growth. Religion is not just about killing; that false belief is a tool for atheist propaganda. As a feminist and a woman I am mindful of, and grateful for, the elevation in the position of women brought about by Christianity. Before Christianity, as historian Rodney Stark has described, female infanticide was a constant of the Classical Greco-Roman world. Not killing female babies, and allowing women some choice and autonomy, was one of the reasons Christianity grew as fast as it did. I'm grateful for agriculture, universities, science, art, and the abolition of slavery, all of which are intertwined with the spread and growth of Christianity.<br /><br />No, we do not give ourselves cancer, and, no, if we just enjoy life and \\"follow our bliss\\" what we want will not fall into our laps. This idea is not a reflection of heaven, but, rather, of Anita's rather sheltered life and upper socio-economic class. It is an idea that will be attractive to other sheltered, economically comfortable people, eliminating, as it does, the need for compassion for the less fortunate.<br /><br />No, it does not contribute to spiritual growth to avoid service work or to do it only when it feels good to do so, and no, Mother Teresa did not deserve Anita's subtle put down. In my own life I have discovered firsthand that \\"bring the body and the heart will follow\\" is a key tenet of service to others. When I was tender with my dying patients even when I was not in the mood to be tender, my patients' appreciation lifted *me* up.<br /><br />No, goodness and badness are not the exact same thing and indistinguishable from each other. Discernment is one of the universally acclaimed features of spiritual maturity. Being able to differentiate between lies and truth, stealing and giving, hurting and healing, is essential.

Not killing female babies, and allowing women some choice and autonomy, was one of the reasons Christianity grew as fast as it did. I'm grateful for agriculture, universities, science, art, and the abolition of slavery, all of which are intertwined with the spread and growth of Christianity.<br /><br />No, we do not give ourselves cancer, and, no, if we just enjoy life and \\"follow our bliss\\" what we want will not fall into our laps. This idea is not a reflection of heaven, but, rather, of Anita's rather sheltered life and upper socio-economic class.

B008GVD6D8|5.0|I can't wait for the next one. Love the story, characters and the final!!! Hope it will be soon the next one
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Ask me & it's a 5 star rating all the way, ask my better 1/2 and it's \\"hokey!\\"...I loved it! Fantastic special affects and a great story line. It was fresh, clean, exciting and very well thought out.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|this absolutely amazing bestseller will be a spin- on in the world of greek and roman myths. rick roirdan is the best author of the mythical world.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|You will not find a more well written and disgusting show/movie anywhere on this planet than The Walking Dead.  Some episodes are a little slow, but they add to the story line as a whole.  Everyone should watch this show. The violence is a little disturbing at times.  Like watching a zombie get his head smashed in or chopped in half, but if you can stomach that type of thing then you will not find a better show on tv. My wife doesnt enjoy that type of violence and I often find her closing her eyes or looking away, but she can't get enough of this show either.  Also, I should add that this show is way more than just zombies getting splattered all over the place.  It's a story of humanity, relationships during trials, and how major conflicts can bring society together and tear them apart at the same time.  Total strangers,doctors, convicts, police, racist rednecks, elderly, children, etc... all working together in a small group with one common goal...survive.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I think this is a super fun game. good for down time, and fun to try to figure out what the person drew! the problem with the app is that it freezes constantly, and wont load the games. I have read many reviews that state the same thing. so to fix it, sometimes you can turn off you device and wait a bit, and other times you just have to delete the app and re-download it. like i said, its fun, but that part is very frustrating. i hear that even the app you buy for this game is that same way, too. i wont be paying money for that.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|Picked this up on impulse.<br /><br />5 bucks<br /><br />Couldn't resist!<br /><br />It was shipped quickly, easy packaging, and it looks really great.  Happy that it was converted well to BluRay
B002W7P5UE|4.0|I used this movie to have my students do a film critique.  It worked well for that as it moves a little slower than what they usually watch.  I still wrestle with paying this much for a movie of this age. It seems to me that 1.99 would be appropriate by now, but it's a fun watch.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was hooked immediately - great story line, very intriguing plot.  But somehow, the style/plot/story/something changed about halfway through ... took a total left turn, and became something I didn't enjoy but rather had to work at to finish.  Too bad...
B0068PHS5Q|5.0|What a find. Once started I could hardly put this book down. Would thoroughly recommend to anyone who loves a good story, beautifully written.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I've enjoy all of DeMille's works and this was no exception.  It is one of the few of his books where I found the first half a little slow and a little too much humor from John Corey's part.  Not that his humor didn't make me laugh or chuckle, but at times I found it annoying, which I guess was part of the point of his comments.  What I love about his books though is how real they are in so many ways.  I would get done with reading a few paragraphs one night, and find bits and pieces of similar actions in the real world Yemen.  I now know more about Yemen, than I had ever planned on knowing.  As always, v ery good book..just not one of my all time favorites.  I would still highly recommend.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|Love this movie and always will; it is a masterpiece, however, Disney still insists on cutting \\"when Love Is Gone\\" from the movie. This is really frustrating! With the movie released in 3 different formats and bonus features, one would think Disney would have at least one of these formats include the song. I love this movie, but I REFUSE to buy it until the scene is put back!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Since discovering Jo Nesbo this summer I have read all but The Redeemer (when will you have the Kindle edition?) in the Harry Hole series.  Fast paced fun.  Waiting on the next book ... let's go Jo.
B007HACDLK|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ IN A LONG LONG TIME.  A REAL PAGE TURNER.  GOOD TO THE END. ONE OF THE BEST, IF NOT THE BEST FLYNN BOOK.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|This is one of my morning apps and I enjoy the variety of topics presented.  Nice link to Wiki for the full story.  Challenging word games and clean graphics make this a pleasant way to start the day.
0307744434|5.0|I want to add my voice to the chorus of praises for this book.  It's remarkable, lyrical, and ingenious.  What else can be said?  A stunning debut, worth anyone's time to read and re-read, and linger over with a cup of cocoa and bowl of popcorn (the descriptions of food are amazing like everything else, so don't read this book on an empty stomach).
B0068FYZ9S|1.0|Five stars for the movie itself. The BluRay version keeps freezing up on new Sony BluRay player however.  The other two Bourne movies worked good in box set, but had to return them twice as \\"Identity\\" was defective.  Bought it on single BluRay disc, but had same freeze up problems. All other BluRay DVDs from Amazon have not had this issue. Amazon has been very good about returns, so not blaming them.  Wish someone with authority would contact Universal Studio or manufacturer of this movie so as to get watchable edition some day.
0446580848|3.0|Too much of  travel log with his trademark humor used in strange places. Somewhat predictable for my long time friend John Corey and somehow I expected more To me. lots of backing and filling on past characters page after page of yet another depictions of the sand ,more sand and the desert at duck.
B008US25E8|3.0|I bought the 2CD/DVD Deluxe version and the vinyl version. The vinyl definitely sounds better and I was surprised to find out it is on clear red colored vinyl. 2/3's of the songs are decent. It maybe the best Aerosmith album since they went pop, but its not blowing me away by any means.
B008NBEY3C|5.0|I can think of no living musician on Sony Classical's roster more deserving of tribute than pianist Murray Perahia.  Since 1972, he's recorded a broad swath of the repertoire at a consistently high level.  No doubt, Sony also appreciates Perahia's loyalty to the label and its predecessor, Columbia (later CBS) Masterworks.<br /><br />Today, many think of Perahia, 65 at the time of this writing, as a Mozart and Bach specialist. But looking over the sequence of recordings as originally issued, his initial concentration was on Schumann, Chopin, and Mendelssohn.  Perahia's style evolved over the years: after the first ardent recordings of the early Romantics, he adopted a more conservative style as evidenced by his series of self-conducted Mozart concertos (still my favorite complete set of these works); In the 1990s, Perahia expanded into more extroverted repertoire and a virtuosic performing style, before hand injuries - not performance related - forced a withdrawal from public performances, a time Perahia used to study Bach.  Anyone with doubts as to the current state of Perahia's technique need only listen to the most recent recording in the set: Brahms' Handel Variations.  (According to an interview in the accompanying book, Perahia is now planning to record Bach's French Suites.)  At every stage of his evolution, Perahia has demonstrated a rare balance in his playing: he's able to convey the structure of the music without sounding dryly analytical; his technique is solid but never meretricious; his tone is lovely without being an end in itself; the emotional temperature of his playing seems \\"just right\\" for each piece.<br /><br />In addition to Perahia's complete Columbia/Sony recordings, a 1967 recording on the Vox label is included, and five DVD's.  In all matters of presentation, Sony has gotten things right.  The original album format recreates the sequence of the LPs and, later, CDs - the original jacket covers and labels are also reproduced.  As a result, the playing time for the first decade's worth of albums is short, but at the budget price the set's offered at, why fret?  I'd rather have short playing times than clumsily sequenced compilation albums.  The beautifully illustrated book contains track information, an index of compositions, and the complete English language liner notes for each album (in addition, a website address is provided with the notes in French and German).<br /><br />All recordings made prior to 1989 have been newly remastered, with pronounced improvement in the sound quality: the strident treble that was heard on early CD issues has been tamed, and the dynamic range has been increased - yielding a warmer, more vibrant sound picture.  (A caveat - the first statement of the opening motif in Beethoven's Op. 22 Sonata has been lopped off - which was NOT the case with the original LP release.)<br /><br />This set is a great bargain, both musically and in terms of overall value.  Judging how previous boxes for [[ASIN:B002P3J3BW Horowitz]], [[ASIN:B006KAWI2C Rubinstein]], and [[ASIN:B00467EKKO Heifetz]] have escalated in price, snap it up while you can.playing time for the first decade's worth of albums is short, but at the budget price the set's offered at, why fret?

B0058ZPNOK|5.0|It's a pretty dark movie but its so good! Spoiler alert,... The ending will rip your heart out in a fantastic way.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Does exactly what the tin says. It's a 9th/10th doctor's sonic screwdriver. It makes a neat little sound like on the show (actually it makes two slightly different sounds). The pin nibs are an interesting addition but I don't really use them. Was thinking about replacing the UV LED with a blue one so it would look more screen-accurate but I really like the UV light for charging up the stick-on glow-in-the-dark stars on my daughter's wall before bedtime, she gets a kick out of it.
B005USZML4|5.0|True Grisham writiing.  Suspenseful.  Kept me awake at night wanting to finish the book!  As always, Grisham shines.  Great book!
B007H1HQW0|5.0|I received this item very quickly and had it together in a few minutes. out of the 4 bottles I did only one came out broken past no use and that is because if you put the bottle in the boiling water to high past the scored line, it will break higher. I am so happy with this product!! I am making some wine bottle hurricane glasses for a wedding centerpieces.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Looks like it will be good but I had to make myself finish it. Not like a usual Grisham!!  don't read it-wait for the next one.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|Taylor Swift has become the #1 name in pop music, having the catchy first single \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" debut at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and having her new album (this one) go Platinum in five days. This album is definitely up to all the hype and sales, and Taylor Swift truly deserves all the attention she is getting - even if she doesn't want all of it, given the necessary poke at the paparazzi she gives in \\"The Lucky One.\\"<br /><br />Highlights of the album include:<br />-The arena-rock opener \\"State of Grace\\" when Taylor explores a sudden relationship<br />-The title track \\"Red\\" about the colorful lust of a past relationship<br />-\\"22\\" about the joys of being that age<br />-The true-to-form \\"I Almost Do\\" where Taylor wonders about the yearning of her ex<br />-The cute ballad \\"Stay Stay Stay\\"<br />-\\"The Last Time,\\" a strong and harmonious duet with Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody, about both sides of an on-and-off relationship gone sour<br />-The disco rock \\"Starlight\\" which shows an exploration of new genres that go beyond strumming a guitar<br />-The closer \\"Begin Again\\" and Taylor's heart pumping red again<br /><br />Other songs such as the Dan Wilson-produced \\"Treacherous,\\" the Max Martin collaboration and mega-hit \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\\" the aforementioned \\"The Lucky One,\\" the reflectional \\"All Too Well,\\" and the eerie \\"Sad Beautiful Tragic\\" that's everything \\"Last Kiss\\" from Speak Now should have been all live up to expectations as well. \\"I Knew You Were Trouble,\\" an over-produced rant of self-blame and misfortune, and although it is written as typical Taylor Swift fare, it becomes annoying.<br /><br />Although the album has some disappointments, like the forgettable \\"Holy Ground\\" and the waste of a duet with Ed Sheeran (\\"Everything Has Changed,\\" a random, unfocused mess), it is overall a very strong effort that lives up to the A+ work of \\"Speak Now\\" two years ago. Even if it is long and has a few duds, it's still well worth a purchase given that over half of the songs are worth listening to. Keep in mind: This is a pop record, even with its few country moments on \\"Treacherous\\" and \\"I Almost Do,\\" and if you're looking for more Fearless-era Taylor Swift, this isn't it. She's growing as an artist in her own direction and trying to discover what her true calling is. Although there are songs that seem to be from different albums here, this sixteen-track set is exploring the variety and evolution of Taylor Swift's songwriting, and the music reflects it.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|Absolutely love this multi tool kit. I'm a big fisherman and the tool really comes in handy. Great tool for any fisherman or outdoorsman.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|I purchased this game thinking it was more of an adventure type game like The Haunt.  I will finish because I get upset when I spend good money and get to certain point and can go no further. There should be a sample of all games so you can decide if it is what you want.
0440178002|5.0|This book is  a page turner!  Washed ashore, barely alive Englishman who succeeds in making a place for himself in a Japan on the cusp of the Tokugawa Shogunate (where Japan is unified for the last time).  It must be said, however, that Clavell is one of those Orientalists who perceive (in his case) Japan as possessing the superior culture (think of the movie 'Rising Sun' as the epitome of this backwards thinking).  This is not too aggravating, as the reader is too caught up in the great story.  Sadly, in my opinion, none of his other books measured up.  In fact, I never finished one.  This book?  A VERY great read!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Not a bad movie, but very drawn out. Could easily have been condensed in to 30mins.<br />There are may scenes in the middle of the movie that really serve no purpose and you will<br />be asking yourself why you are watching them. But otherwise ok.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! It's very fun, very addicting! I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a great brain teaser!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|love this show. would watch it every day if I could. the whole staff at this show should be proud and I am really glad amazon made it so that I could watch when every one else does.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed this book very much.  We have read all of his others, and feel this is probably his best one!  My husband ordered it as soon as we received notice that it was available in the Kindle Store.  He could not put it down.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A very fun read. You can tell Mr. Grisham had a good time writing it. Suspensful waiting for the next shoe to fall.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Thought this was a good novel by Grisham.  Certainly enough interesting twists/turns to keep it moving.  The plot might have been a bit too complex to be believable.  I realize most readers like all the pieces to fall into place but in this case \\"the plan\\" going off without any snags was a bit unrealistic.<br /><br />Side note: How do 5 gold bars @ $12,200 each add up to $122K ?  Think I reread this page 3 times and still can't make the math work.....<br /><br />Bottom line is that I would recommend this book as a good read but certainly not Grisham's best work.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Addicting!! I love the hats and the Jellyfish. Its great, you must dowload it. Worth the 2.99. Its fun ! (:
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game. I love earning coins while I am not playing. Just got the game yesterday and see that it could become addictive.  The price is great and best of all you don't have to wait for someone else to play.
0425263908|3.0|Very,very similar to fifty shades,language a little more explicitness. You read on to find answers about the characters. Was intrigued to get second book and liked it better. Characters are evolving !
B003JTHXOK|3.0|True to form, Nicholas Sparks keeps the reader on the edge of her seat throughout the entire novel.  Unfortunately, the ending leaves SO much to be desired!  Readers who love Sparks' novels do so because he the hero and heroine connect at the end, leaving readers feeling satisfied.  I am very disappointed with the lack of closure at the end.  I can only hope that Sparks did this on purpose and has a sequel in the works.  The book was awesome, but the ending stunk.
0425263916|5.0|Second book picks up the pace and gives more details to the characters and the issues they have. The surrounding characters also evolve more into the storyline, peaking your interest to read on and get answers!
B0090YHSFC|4.0|Reminds me a lot of Jezzball, where you try and cut off as much of the mass as possible, while keeping all the penguins on the floe.  Cute little time waster, and for free?  As well as a distinct lack of permissions required, worth a download.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|This movie was simple and odd. I don't think i will ever watch it again. Just not super fantastic. Interesting cinematography and good acting.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|This album is easily comparable to any other pop star making music now but is made great and unique by Christina's vocals. Other than Shut Up, there isn't a terrible song on here. There is some filler and Circles, while fun and sassy, is kind of stupid and lyrically ridiculous. But otherwise, each track is amazing on their own. Let there Be Love is the most dancey song and probably should have been the first single. Army of me is also a dance track but is feisty and rock driven. I imagine it will be a gay club anthem. Blank Page is a phenomenal ballad and her vocals are pretty much perfect on it. My favorite song is the oddest pairing. Just a Fool with Blake Shelton. While it would have been better with a rock singer, it's nothing short of amazing. Lyrics, vocals, music, etc. Perfect mid tempo ballad. I also love the two bonus tracks. (I refuse to acknowledge Shut Up as part of this album). The only criticism I would give this album is that Christina has spent most of her career trying to convince people that she is an artist and above formulaic pop. This definitely falls into that category so it's an odd choice for her. She seems slightly desperate to be a contender for next queen of pop. However, at the very least, she succeeded in making an amazing pop album and her vocals are miles above anyone else in that category.
B0055SWM08|1.0|This game is too slow.  When I need to destress the lah dee dab atmosphere only serves to irritate me.  The early games are crazy easy, mix that with the lay dee dah it becomes monotonous.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|This album is simply amazing. I am a huge Deftones fan and they may very well be my top favorite band. All of their albums are great but this one has to be the best. Before Koi No Yokan came out, my favorite was Around the Fur but this one is just so amazing.<br /><br />The fact that they can change is awesome. Deftones are a modern day version of The Cure. Nuff' said. Simply amazing cd.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Tesseract makes its games without advertisements they have explanations for an incredible amount of games. Check it out you will never use the MobilityWare games again. I am so glad I gave them a try.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Probably it is the fantasy book with the highest quality/price ratio I've ever read.<br />Good characters, plot, and rhythm.<br />Waiting for the next books!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|If you like games like sudoku and quell this is probably up alley.  I'd say its a cross between the two using colors.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is too long of a wait for an update because ios has 0.5.0 out but why not us we all payed the same but we have to wait a few more days to get.  GREAT GAME, BUT NOT FOR WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has done it again...another great novel with \\"keep ya guessing\\" twists and turns! I couldn't put this book down till the very end!  Another great read, and one I highly recommend, especially to all good mystery readers!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Engaging, well written adventure. I envy her for having the guts to accomplish this grueling hike. I hated for it to end! I recommended this book to all my adventure seeking friends!!!
B009AMAMF2|5.0|Cloud Atlas is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. A masterpiece. I know why there will be some who don't like this movie... It's because it may be a bit complicated to understand. However, everything from the music to the actors, artwork and story and all the other details, like the post apocalyptic future where people even have a different type of English dialect or in the futuristic Korea where humans actually look slightly different due to evolution over the next 100+ years. It's simply amazing and may even have changed my perception about where our own world is headed... Into a dark time.
0143121006|2.0|This book was quite disappointing.  I heard the author discuss the 'story' on two public radio broadcasts.  In both cases he had more to say about larger events surrounding the circumstances of the murder than appeared in the actual publication.  I do not recommend.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case cover does a great job at protecting and keeping your kindle clean.<br />It's easy to open with an elastic strap to keep it in place.<br />If you want to keep your kindle in good order without scratches, this is the way to go.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005V2EVBQ Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Case Cover by Marware, Black]]
B007TK77QE|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. Bit diffuclt getting head around all the characters in the 1st couple of chapters but from then on WOW excellent.
B0090YHSFC|1.0|what do you mean theres no permissions and i can play on a rooted phone?!?! just joining the masses as an uninformed rating ruiner.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|The whole family can enjoy this movie. I waxs pleasently surprised when watching it, it even got my husband 's attention. That is reaally hard unless it is a lot of shooting and blowing up stuff.
B0037B6QSY|2.0|It is a nice book with a nice message. However, I can't say there was much new than Seeker 101 might have already guessed. I was hoping for a little more from this book. Basically, a pretty neutral rating depending on the message you need to get right now.  Good luck.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|American Horror Story embodies the realities of modern life (depression, birth issues, infidelity) and mixes them into a deep horror mythos that makes the flawed characters the focus rather than unnecessary special effects, too much blood or insane violence that has recently become what makes up the so-called horror genre. In focusing on the characters and their everyday lives within the construct of the \\"Horror House,\\" AHS allows us to relate to the story in a very real way. We live through the depressed teen, the terribly troubled unfaithful spouse, the hurt and seemingly fragile mom, so that when something supernatural occurs we are really struck not only by the \\"horror\\" but the emotional impact.<br /><br />And why would anyone stay in such a chaotic environment where so many horrific things occur? Because all of their money is wrapped up in the house! This takes the normal \\"why stay\\" mentality we experience in lesser thought out horror shows or movies and turns it into something we not only can relate to, but that makes us feel even more deeply for the troubled souls who live there...alive or otherwise.<br /><br />Dylan McDermott somehow carries the tortured role to a wonderful apex, especially with his eyes. Jessica Lange gives a great performance time and time again, from the troubled mother, the nasty spiteful neighbor, the commanding lover...she has such a range! I personally love that the series doesn't feel the need to interject copious amounts of blood or language, so that we can focus on the fun of the fright. From ghosts, urban legends, Halloween tales, mutants and more, this show has a little bit of every corner of the horror genre.<br /><br />I only wish this release had some special features.  There are some things that would have been great to both hear commentary on as well as see behind the story.
0425263916|4.0|This book was just awesome! Not only did it carry on the story but it kept the plot intense all the way through the novel. When you finally find out Gideon's past at the end, it is mind blowing. Obviously he was acting weird through out some of the book but the way she spun it at the end and explained was everything was unexpected. I loved that Eva went around and confronted all the people she thought she needed to, made a fuss, then ended up being happy at the fact that she did it (that was pretty funny). The creative foreshadowing done by the author was impressive as well. When the Eva's mom came around the corner and 'looked like she saw a ghost'. Then the ending with the detective really ties it all together.<br /><br />As a reader, I was getting anxious when Gideon kept saying \\"You have to trust me\\", that line just killed me every time!!! I just wanted to know why, but obviously you find out. The whole book keeps your attention on point!<br /><br />But overall, great book. Cant wait for the third one!!!! Hope there are more than 3 books in this Crossfire series!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|I love this cd! I bought it as a gift for a friend it is one of her favorite CDs!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is challenging and fun. I love it. Don't be fooled by its simple looking face.  It can keep you thinking.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|As usual, I am not disappointed with the songs on this album.  I listened to it more than once on a 4 hour drive and enjoyed it over and over again!
B00338QENI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! We all owe so much to Henrietta Lacks, yet she and her family struggled all their lives. Kudos to Rebecca Skloot for bringing this story to light! I hope her family can finally benefit from her mother's story the same way we all have benefitted from her contributions to modern medicine.
B00571F26Y|4.0|it's interesting to think that we are bombarded with news to eat eat eat whole grains and wheat products, brainwashed into thinking we are doing something good for our bodies<br />when in reality we are causing ourselves harm. We have been told the rate of obesity has increased yet we eat what they tell us is good for us. how does this happen? very informative. I'm trying to limit my intake of wheat, don't have any health issues that connect with it but I've lost a few pounds without totally following it.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|I've been an AMD fan for a very long because of their products allow you to enjoy a solid product, while adding the ability to push the performance envelope.  Without question, this CPU has been a great system addition.  For the last year, I've run it at 3.7Ghz without any signs of stress -- 500 Mhz higher than the 3.2Ghz base.  My machine has been on 24x7 for numerous weeks handling games, movies and work in stellar fashion.<br /><br />With the current buzz about the new AMD 8320's and 8350's, I felt some \\"pressure\\" to push the CPU further.  For the last month, I've been running without any hiccups whatsoever at 3.9Ghz (19.5 times the 200 Mhz CPU core) and couldn't be happier.  Keep in mind, that is 22% beyond the base 3.2Ghz rating and my system hasn't shown any signs of issue.  For now I couldn't be happier despite a little admitted envy for the new chip!<br /><br />If you're looking for a solid performer that you can easily push beyond the base performance stats and establish a solid platform for your gaming, media or work system... pick one of these up now!
0399157565|3.0|I keep hoping for vintage Scarpetta to resurface, but that is not to be it seems.<br /><br />Evidenced here is a mish-mash of dysfunctional relationships between Scarpetta & all those closest to her. I hate that Benton has been made to appear like a mere appendage. Scarpetta is acting like a victim, really, in her position, this so unlikely & unattractive.<br /><br />She has made all her characters so horribly jaded & unpleasant it's hard to digest. It's impossible to feel the slightest connection with any of them anymore.<br /><br />I found the murder mystery story line interesting up to a point & then was completely flabbergasted at the end. All I could think was `HUH?\\" What a let down. It made absolutely no sense.<br /><br />Having been so taken with Dr. Kay Scarpetta from the very beginning I am sad to see the series disintegrate into this shambles. Having said that, this novel is much better than the last 2 or 3 or 4 but then, that's not saying much.
B005LAII12|5.0|The movie? well let's see....... it was full on comedy at its best. Seth MacFarlane, Mark Wahlburgh, and Mila Kunis have completely outdone themselves. A talking teddy bear, knowing he's alive, and doing all the things a partyer would do. I don't think there will be a movie to top this comedy for a very, very, VERY long time. Yes it did have a lot of dirty jokes but it just added to the humor. I would recommend this to anybody who is atleast 14 or older. 10/10 and with a good storyline.
B004R96SPQ|5.0|I love this book and it was so good that I just had to get the sequel book! I would strongly reccommend it to anyone who loves a great suspense in a book.
B008H5J510|3.0|I bought the 3 disc bluray combo.The movie was great.But i can't find the bonus/special feature as written in the 2D Bluray disc.All content is same,all of them are movie presentation in different disc only.Anybody can help me?Thx
B004F1F32A|5.0|I needed to see this movie first before I could go with a friend to see \\"Taken 2\\".  Could  not get it on Netflix and was luck to rent it on amazon.<br />  Great movie, lots of suspense.  Thought it would be predictable but wasn't, kept me glued to my seat.  Highly recommend.

0785163174|2.0|Just received this book today, and typically, I'd be inclined to write a fair and honest review about this book, but I am completely unable to enjoy this book as it is intended to be read.  The binding is horrendous.  Glued-binding on a book this size is a sin.  All of the artwork 1/2 an inch from the gutter is ruined, and two-page panels are victimized by the binding.  Amazon, if you read this review, I notice this book was briefly pulled from availability a few days ago, then placed back on sale today.  If this is a result of responding to the binding, I would hope you would encourage anyone who has purchased it in glued-binding to return it, if it is indeed being re-released in sewn-binding.  Of course, that's all speculative on my part.  However, if glued-binding is the only way this volume is produced, then shame on you, Marvel.  This is your signature event of the year, and you have spat in the face of anyone who has paid the $75.00 cover price, or any price for that matter.  Furthermore, you have taken what appears to be brilliant artwork by Kubert, Coipel and Romita Jr., and marred it. As a life-long Marvel fan, this has to be the only disappointment I've truly experienced in purchasing a trade volume.  A big one at that.  2 stars, \\"I don't like it\\".
B001FD5KJM|5.0|I got his for my 7 year old as he is all into the avengers so we wanted to start with the movies that started the series. He loved it but so did my wife so no issues making the purchase.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|There is a lot heavier stuff on here that I think some people are missing somehow.  I love how the style of this album is a combination of their much older sound from Louder than Love but has other elements similar to Cornell's solo album \\"Euphoria Morning\\" and just as much \\"Down on the Upside\\" or \\"Badmotorfinger\\" tracks.  There is a distinct lack of the sound found on Superunknown so don't expect to have a repeat of that style here.  I love the guitar sound, that they make it heavy without the mega-gained out sound of modern metal.  This is real grunge and I love it.  Matt Cameron is seriously an amazing drummer too, you can tell he really brings a lot to their sound.  I don't think this sounds at all like Audioslave and that makes me happy too.  I was pretty afraid of what this album was going to turn out to be and I am not remotely disappointed.  I'm now going to see them in January and really looking forward to it!  Rock on guys! :)
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I love this CD and movie. While the story line is predictable the music is wonderful.  Surprisingly Tom Cruise sings very well.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|The Night Circus took my breath away. It has been a long time since a book took me on such a magical journey. The circus, the characters, the magic weaved - were vivid images in my mind as Erin Morgenstern spins her tale, pulling me deeply into another world, far away from the harsh reality that surrounds us everyday. That is what a book should do, and this one does it absolutely magnificantly!<br />I am eagerly awaiting her next book...hopefully soon.
0385536828|3.0|Although I've enjoyed most of McEwan's novels their manipulativeness has always bothered me, most of all in 'Atonement'. In his latest, 'Sweet Tooth' he has manipulated his readers once again. The novel takes place in the 1970's, the Cold War is ongoining. Young, beautiful Serena Frome, fresh out of Cambridge becomes a low level spy of sorts, for the British government. The government sets up a foundation as a front to funnel money to writers who have an anti-Communist bent. On the surface the foundation appears legitimate and the writers who participate are unaware of the source of their stipends. Serena is given the task of engaging a young professor. T.H. Healy in the Sweet Tooth program. They become lovers, of course. He achieves success. He is unaware she has set him up. Will she reveal herself?<br /><br />Healy is a doppelganger for McEwan. Through him, the author can talk about literary matters, comment on the literary scene and use his real life friends as ancillary characters. At one point while discussing literature Serena tells Tom she doesn't like tricks in books. \\"I liked life as I knew it recreated on the page'. Tom replies,'it wasn't possible to recreate life on the page without tricks'. This same theme is repeated by Serena several times in the course of the novel rendered even more ironic when we come to the end of this contrived story.<br /><br />This reader does not agree with McEwan that it isn't possible to recreate life on the page without tricks. Sure McEwan is clever, but for me his tricks, while occasionaly entertaining are wearing thin, especially as I saw this one coming half-way through the novel.
B000062X90|5.0|I have no complaints.  I had this on vinyl. Wanted it on CD.  Sounds much better now.  Wishbone Ash was very popular at one point when I was growing up.  This brings back the good times for me.
B007MFLFMI|3.0|I am a little disappointed, it is below my expectations I thought that something coming from Vince and Martin would be awesome. In my opinion the beat is too monotonous or repetitive...sometimes boring, some of the electronic sounds reminds me The Electric Eclectics of Dick Hyman, nontheless it can not be compared to it. On the other hand, As a DM fan since the early 80's I could sense some DM \\"flavor\\" in FLUX.I am still figuring it out... I just liked only five tracks out of ten in the album. Lowly, Single Blip, Bendy bass, Flux and Spock. Lowly is dark, enigmatic and kind of spooky. The black wings, the shoes that the skinny girl is wearing in the video makes an amazing visual effect in the shape her body, It looks more like a bird...an ugly black bird...spooky...however, I like the video... Single Blip is my favorite although musically speaking it has a very simple and monotonous beat,a small repetive synth melody...good for dancing. I am not a musician but I have been listening DM for the last 30 years and I consider that I have some knowledge to differentiate good material from average.
B0007TKNII|5.0|The dvd was in great condition, the movie is exactly what I expected and it was wide screen. No complaints here.<br /><br />On the movie it's self: If you have not seen it before, but know the Broadway musical, some of the songs have changed just slightly.<br />Also, though I think the actors/ actresses did a splendid job in the move, being that they are not professional opera singers, they do not compare to the music of the Broadway play (far less voice range).
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Smart, witty writing .  Julianna Margulies is not only gorgeous, but a fantastic actress .  I love what they have done with her role.  Christine Barananski and Josh Charles are excellent as partners in the law firm where Julianna is employed.  The only show I like as well is Homeland.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is by far the best nonogram puzzle app in the market. I have tried most of them, and this one surpasses all of them by a wide margin. It has an easy interface and works very well on my Samsung Galaxy Note.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Best show since The Good Wife.  Damien Lewis and Claire Danes have amazing on screen charisma.  I watched Mr. Lewis in Band of Brothers and Life.  He is one of my favorite actors.  The plot is on the edge of your seat exciting.
B008458O3S|5.0|This is an incredible game. Big kudos to the developer. I couldn't stop playing it since I got it. The good old concept of logic gates applied to a game is great. Besides being an awesome game, I think its a great way to learn the basic concept on binary computing!.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Purchased this before a six hour flight and it held my attention the whole time. Started out in Creative Mode to get used to gameplay then started Survival Mode. Very cool. I have not played XBOX or PC version but this one is good enough for me. I am looking forward to playing it on iPad when I get home.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|The game can be fun IF you can figure out what to do.  I am keeping it just to finish what i started, other than that i would delete it.

B0046B3QTG|5.0|Finally had the time to sit down and watch the movie. I've thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the story plot is simple, he characters in there are great and a couple scenes have truly moved me. Everyone should see this if they haven't like me :)
0810994739|4.0|Worth buying and reading though Rodrick is a jerk esspecially in this one and I don't like when books do that and I feel bad for Greg.

0810993139|5.0|The thirst book it was funny its pretty good I totally reccomend it awesome sweet you will get stuck in it you wont want to stop reading it.
030758836X|4.0|The story was so fun it made up for the poor editing.  The dialog was very week in spots but the extreme creativity of the story line made up for this.  I almost gave up after 125 pages,  but I hung on (despite my 100 page rule) and was glad that I did.  The story was a 5 star and the editing was a 1 star.
0810983915|2.0|Good but rowley is being a big jerk and it stupid how rowley gets special treatment from his parents my least favorite in the series. Do not reccomend
B004FOA84A|1.0|No real story to speak of, very few puzzles, terribly short game.  No maps nor a hint button.<br /><br />I do not recommend.<br /><br />Try Enigmatis:  The Ghosts of Maple Creek instead.  A far superior game for the same price.
1419702238|4.0|This is a good book I thought it was funny until the third wheel came out I thought it was funnier.
0553240633|5.0|I got a second-hand mass paperback edition, rather than the Kindle version, which reviewers say was shot through with errors.  I thought the book was great, making the personalities who created and manned the Mercury program come alive.<br /><br />I did have a question from the book.  Wolfe made no secret of his feeling that the apex of the right stuff quality was to be found in the working test pilots.  The astronauts had the right stuff, without question, but had a tough time keeping their edge since flying high-performance aircraft was not part of the astronaut training program.<br /><br />Wolfe also more than hinted that the manned spaceflight exploration by the X-15 and X-20 experimental models was a lost opportunity when that program was cancelled.<br /><br />I would have liked to see some informed speculation on whether an aircraft along the lines of the X-20 would be able to transition into orbital spaceflight, or was the X-15 program just a spectacular dead end?  Perhaps \\"The Right Stuff\\" was not intended to consider such questions, but the book definitely lays out the view that the X-15 was cancelled for political, rather than technical, reasons.
B00846REIS|5.0|Sylvia Day did an awesome job writing this book that I went on a four hour sleep one night trying to finish it. Eva and Gideon had great chemistry, and they also both shared a trouble past.  Their love was so intense even though they both have major issues, but their pull for each other is so strong it worked for them.  Awesome book!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is more than a story. As a Physician I was impressed with the descriptiveness of what he saw and experienced. I would recommend this book to all
B0045XICB2|5.0|man I couldnt wait to watch this movie with all the action in this movie I couldn't stop wwatching the movie. my son  liked it as well. It kept me wanting more cant wait to see twilight saga breaking dawn 2

B006YXTRHY|5.0|omg I loved this movie, the part I lked the most was when they worked together to save bella. and bella and edward finally get married very awesome.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It is a good story. Better than the first. The intimate scenes in both books have been a little repetitious...The storyline is exciting. I love a good romance novel.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|This book was a rather juvenile story.  Kind of dumb to say the least but I gave it two stars because I finished it.  When I give one star I don't finish it.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|This is a must buy for any Lana fan.  It is truly a paradise when you listen to it.  This album shows off Lana's ability to sing.  IT shows that she is a great singer.  If you are thinking of buying it you should.  I recommend this album for anyone, even if you aren't a fan you should buy it!
B00A66A3XW|2.0|First season of Revenge was just spectacular! It kept me wanting more and always ended each episode with a semi-believable twist so that I couldn't wait to power through the next episode. In that way it reminded me of the first season of Prison Break where you just can't stop watching. Emily was fueled by such a sense of wanting revenge and trying to meet her plans all while feeling emotions for those people that could end up casualties. Season two does not have the fierceness of season one. In fact, it just feels like a soap opera badly acted. I had been telling my husband to watch this show for months now and he came in while I was watching an episode of season two and he actually laughed out loud. He said it looked terrible and I had to admit, with pregnant Amanda falling off the staircase at Grayson manner and all the other ridiculous plot twists in that episode, it was every bit as farfetched and cheesy as the old 90's Melrose Place episodes. I am going to give it a few more episodes but I may just check out of this season if it doesn't redeem itself. I still love Emily and I am still rooting for Jack who is the only believable character at this point. However, Nolan and Victory's acting is over-the-top this season and don't even get me started on Aiden. I am just hoping that it picks ups soon.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This one was great fun. Really enjoyed the intertwining of a well told vampire storyline with a foe historical Lincoln background. Just wonder was that supposed to be Obama at the end? Maybe we are looking forward to a Part II during he second term?
B009HV2JT8|3.0|It was just okay. I saw the previews for this movie and I was really excited to see it and when I did I was a little disappointed. Thought it was going to be much better and less...Korny.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Truly was an indulgence of the imagination! I enjoyed going on the journey, but would have liked to see how the multitude of religions sustained him during the journey.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watch every show, haven't missed one yet. I'm addicted to it, it's just suspenseful and gripping from the very beginning!
B00992CF6W|5.0|so I downloaded 5.0 from a site, and here are some instructions.<br />do not build a nether Reactor in your home. the field of obsidian is huge, and is several layers thick.<br />do not break glowstone after you place it.<br />do not use the nether Reactor with a full bag. I lost everything important from it.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is right up my alley. It is kind of a modern day Robin Hood with many secret twists and turns.<br />Great action and good plot lines. I hope they have many more good seasons.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is definitely a stay-up-all-night-to-finish-even-if-you-have-work-in-the-morning page-turner. Not only is the story fascinating and the characters well-developed, but this is actually a beautifully written book as far as thrillers go. I would definitely recommend this!
B005EWDA9M|5.0|Utterly mesmerising  I could not put 1Q84 down.....read it at your peril and be seduced by Murakami's dream world of beguiling characters.

B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I don't give 5 stars lightly, but PTXMas has earned it and then some.<br /><br />I discovered them this morning thanks to a facebook share and was shocked at how fantastic they were. I watched their \\"Carol of the Bells\\" video on youtube and came right here to get the album. Having had some musical training myself, I can honestly say that these singers don't just have good voices. They are true artists and musicians. The compositions are brilliantly arranged and showcase different singers in different songs. My only wish is that they had a few more songs on the album, but the price per song and for the album is fair. I am on my second listen of the day already.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|Season two was just as entertaining as season 1. There were alot of plot twists, and some characters were punished who I thought shouldn't have been. However, with the legal action tipped in Nucky's favor, an FBI agent exposed as a criminal, and a land deed transferred to a church, I am quite looking forward to the third season. Kudos to the producers and writers!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Downloaded for my Kindle app.  I love the story so much, but it's not exactly a light read.  Sometimes you feel as though you're mentally wading through the prose.
B008QTUA5W|1.0|Wow what a disappointment. Just finished season 1...I can't believe anyone actually enjoyed this dreck.<br /><br />This show is like a watered-down, excruciatingly slow-paced, and far less realistic version of '24'. Not a single character is compelling or likeable. The producers of the show couldn't even bother to get details right (like the rank, uniform, and haircut of the main Marine character)?<br /><br />Given the positive reviews I guess it's just me, but I would recommend avoiding this show like the plague unless you want a cure for insomnia.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I love Sherlock Holmes.  Even though his deductions are improbably, it's never not fun reading.<br />If you get the chance, you should get The Seven Percent Solution.  It's a fantastic Sherlock Holmes companion piece.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought this book was really good.  It kinda seems repetitive from some of the things said in the other books, but I still really enjoyed it!
B0000DIXDR|4.0|Very good movie enjoyed it as much as original which came out several years ago. Would recommend it to all.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent reading.  I learned about the gift from God of \\"Free Will\\".  Our free will is powerful and I apply it to my daily prayers to stop smoking and it has made it easier for me because I willed it.  I've always known there is a heaven and the more I hear about it, the more I'm certain.  I'm grateful for Dr. Alexander's sharing his story. Easy reading except for the tech words of the brain....but I understood what he meant.
B005K15XR4|5.0|This CD provided me with several of my favorite themes from movie trailers in addition to introducing me to some brilliant new ones I hadn't heard before.

Its a great family movie with amazing artistic scenery though out. Enjoy

B002ZG97EC|5.0|The story is great for everyone in the family. Its funny how movies can get you to root for even the villains, that's when you know the movie got you. We now only buy the blu ray dvd 2 packs. Blu ray for the house and dvd for the car. Saves money and if one get scratched we still have a working copy.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|It was a pretty good movie, lots of action, I liked the sarcastic sense of humor. I thought it always looked like a decent movie to watch, it ended up being better than I expected.
034580404X|5.0|Just couldn't put these adult chick books down.  Reading the books in order made the storyline make sense and kept my interest.

0307720950|5.0|As again Chris Anderson write perfect book. I recomended this book for all people who want/think to start own business.<br /><br />With love form Russia. Max.
1400032717|3.0|The neighbor's dog has been murdered and Christopher is determined to play \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" to find the killer. He has an unusual way of looking at the world, which both helps and hinders his investigation. Christopher, through his detecting, unravels more secrets and finds more answers than he was looking for or is capable of handling.<br /><br />Mark Haddon has written several children's books and \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is his first adult novel. The story is told in a first person narrative from the point of view of Christopher Boone, a 15 year old autistic boy. Mr. Haddon worked with autistic children when he was a young man.<br /><br />This is a very sad story about an autistic teenage boy who decides to solve a mystery using his special unique talents. He is highly gifted in mathematics and in solving problems, but he is unable to deal with life and does not know how to respond to people.  He does not like to be touched, and if someone touches him, he will strike back using violence.<br /><br />This is a standalone story, and it is told in an interesting and unique manner. The story is told in a memoir style from the point of view of an autistic boy who has Asperger's Syndrome. Rather than numbering the chapters numerically, they instead are numbered in an increasing sequence of prime numbers, which is a good representation of how Christopher views life. I recommend this book as a good read.<br /><br />Favourite quote:<br /><br />\\"Lots of things are mysteries. But that doesn't mean there isn't an answer to them. It's just that scientists haven't found the answer yet.\\" (Page 100)<br /><br />for more of my reviews go to books-treasureortrash.com
B007HACDLK|5.0|\\"The Last Man\\" is excellent and will hold your interest from start to finish.<br /><br />Mitch Rapp, the dynamic superhero, is sent to Afghanistan because Joe Rickman, a covert operative, is kidnapped from a safe house.  Rickman who has a profound memory retains the names of hundreds of operatives both American and foreign, and  when tortured, in all probability, will reveal their identities.  Thus, these operatives and assets will be killed and the CIA will be drastically compromised.  Mitch has to work fast to find Rickman, and his investigation brings him to Kabul where he is ambushed by a cadre of corrupt Afghani police officers.  He and three others engage in a horrific firefight until a helicoptor comes to evacuate them.  However, just before the helicoptor arrives, Mitch booby traps the door  with oxygen tanks and shoots the tanks just as the police knock down the door.  Mitch is injured, and his team member, Scott Coleman, brings him to safety.  Mitch is confined to a hospital for a week.  Irene Kennedy takes an emergency flight to Afghanistan.  And an obnoxious FBI Agent barges into the hospital where Mitch is confined demanding to question him only to be thwarted by a feisty Master Sergeant who refuses to let anyone disrupt any of her patients.  This FBI Agent, Wilson by name, claims to have evidence that Mitch Rapp and Joe Rickman have been stealing millions from the CIA coffers and depositing it into a Zurich account.  All of this occurs in the first 10% of the book.<br /><br />Intricate plot developments and subplots abound in this book.  And there is a twist in this work that is at once creative and ironic.  As always in a Vince Flynn work, the characters are well developed, and this book is well-written.  And characteristic of this author's style, he imparts technical data of military equipment and armaments.  The author also discusses a \\"reintegration\\" program that is being implemented in Afghanistan by American diplomats whereby Taliban members, terrorists and decent Afghani citizens are being drawn into government positions. The pitfalls of the program are clear.<br /><br />Vince Flynn in his creation of Mitch Rapp has given us a great American hero.  Would it were that there was a real live Mitch Rapp in the world to give us peace of mind. Amazon verified purchase.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The only thing not in the book was speculation as to why it took the president nearly 12 months dithering before giving the green light.
030758836X|3.0|First of all, I'm going to disagree with those who felt the ending was a letdown. In fact, it was perfect. Absolutely Twilight Zoneian. I won't give a spoiler here, but knowing a person like one of the characters in this book, the last chapter absolutely knocked me out. Sensational.<br /><br />Second, the plot twists and turns were amazing, and Flynn manages to pull them off. As soon as I found myself thinking, \\"Oh, come on...\\" Flynn drops in just the right amount of justification.<br /><br />This fits that cliche \\"compulsively readable.\\" It reminded me of Scott Smith's A Simple Plan in that way. You keep thinking, No, it can't be, and then it is.<br /><br />So why only three stars, when Flynn is so obviously talented? Because of the sophomoric insistence on the F bomb. Please. Stop. It's not realistic and it's not necessary. It's a hip novelist's idea of what hip novelists should write. Very off putting.<br /><br />But if you can get by that, you might really enjoy this novel.

B007FG9LIE|3.0|Very  interesting at the beginning, but got \\"weird\\" and \\"far out\\" middle to end of the book. The book was not what I was expecting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose this rating because it was an awesome book!!! I hated the ending though. It makes u want to read mockingjay
B0090YHSFC|4.0|As others have mentioned,if you remember the classic game of Qix that was around in the 80s, this is very similar to that.You have little penguins sliding all across an ice sheet and it is your job to break up the ice into smaller chunks but not slice into a penguin, or allow them to be seperated from each other. I have only played a few levels, but i can see how this game will become quite challenging in later levels. So far, I am finding this game to be quite fun and can recommend it as a FAOTD.<br />Also, its quite refreshing to have an app that doesn't need all types of permissions that has the user wondering what the developer is up to.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I love all the actors in this movie, it's goofy brain candy. If you only enjoy Oscar worthy films this is not for you. However, if you enjoy a fun ride with Depp, check it out.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|This book has truly taught me a lot about myself,the positives and negatives. If you take the time to just read this book, it can only deliver a more positive balance in your life. Love this book! There is a workbook you can purchase separately as well(I found out after I read the whole book. While reading the book, I kept thinking how great it would have been for the author to include some study sheets or something along those lines. Well, there is such a thing so I decided to re-read the book and do the workbook with my read. OMG, very glad I decided to do this. I understand NVC more in depth because of the workbook. Worth paying the small price for the book and workbook!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|If you're a fan of this show and have already watched the first four seasons, treat yourself to a real cliffhanger!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I kept hearing about this series from friends but since I no longer subscribe to HBO I wasn't able to watch it on cable. I've been watching on my new Surface and it's great. Wish I didn't have to wait so long to watch the new season.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This is an amazing book with very unique writing styles. It is about a family's journey to reunion. The main character is a child with autism and the story is told extremely well from his perspective. Overall amazing book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I'm not sure you would call this a typical Grisham book but I enjoyed it.  Some suspense and a few surprises.  A good book to take on vacation.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|can't put it down! Very clever consept! Played until my kindle went dead the first night I played! Very interested to see part 2
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Think prince meets Michael Jackson, meets ginuwine in his prime and you have one spectacular well made album.<br /><br />Vocals, production, sound is all tight. I can listen to the whole cd without skipping. I love how there's an abundance of songs. Buy this album now. You won't regret it.
098478280X|5.0|This book was a great companion that helped me prepare for my job interviews. I think no matter what stage of your career you are in, if you are trying to get a new job in the Software/Tech industry, you should read this book. It will help you refresh your basics and get lots and lots of practice.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I did not relate to the main character since he was just too unbelievable and the back and forth between characters left much to be desired. Just not my type of book.
B009AZZEU2|2.0|Not a fan of Soundgarden's less aggresive rock style! With Chris Cornell back at the helm, why no real hook, line & sinker tracks that rock hard & heavy! No major impact with this stuff INMOP! Not much left to say but, \\"Where's the wall of sound? Going grungeless? Disappointing and not what was expected\\"!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I like to try out new authors and this time I push this one back.  I'm not interested enough to finish the book.  I don't like the writers style or the story line, not that anyone else would not, it could just be a broad generation gap for me.
B009YQJ322|5.0|the acting is outstanding they got Judge Dredd right this time along with his partner Jude Anderson and the villan Ma-ma a movie not to be missed.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I LOVED this book and it is my favorite book of hers.  I enjoy all of Nora Roberts' books but especially love the murder mysteries.  This one was great, and the dogs in the story are adorable.  She has such a fantastic way to tell a story, and describe the scenery to really put the reader there in the story.
B00902MCVY|3.0|After all this time Wintersun delivers their new record TIME and I am a bit let down. First off the album starts off with some kind of Final Fantasy theme, with harps etc. The songs are more mid paced and slow with hardly any fast parts. Some of the singing choruses sound rehashed, I've heard Ensiferum do some of these melodies before. Also, the lyrics are absolutely pointless, uninspired, and bland. The album has some ok guitar riffs, screaming vocals, and the album is short I expected something epic. I've heard they have broken the album in half so they can get more money out of it. That's sad because the album could of been lots more varied and epic than this short disney metal record.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Same story, same background, same dialog as all the other Reacher novels. Shabby itinerant stumbles into a situation, takes over the lead from FBI, CIA, local police, etc and then takes out a dozen armed men with a hand chop and an elbow. Repetitive, simplistic and silly!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|i luv this game i especially luv all the different combonations and also i enjoyed doodle devil and doodle farm.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|All I ask is that a movie make some sense.  Just some.  I want to feel like the writers and directors actually thought about it before filming it.<br /><br />Well... that didn't happen in Prometheus.<br /><br />Let's just skip ahead to when the humans enter the alien facility and find the black goo stuff.  So what exactly does the black goo do anyway?  Does it destroy your body?  Does it make your head explode?  I suppose it does because that's what happens to the alien head they discover it and thaw out.  But wait a minute... what about the astronaut geologist who falls on his face in the black goo after having his helmet melted?  Apparently, the black goo turns him into a super strong psychotic zombie or something.  One minute we think he is dead, the next he is running around like something out of The Walking Dead.  What's up with that?  How come to goo basically dissolves one person, but turns another into a zombie?<br /><br />But wait... maybe it depends on the amount of black goo you are exposed to.  The android gives one of the humans a small drop of the black goo in a glass of booze.  Now you may be wondering why the android would do that... good question.  Perhaps an experiment or something.  Can't say for sure because it really isn't clear.  Anyway, in the case of one drop of black goo I guess it takes a day or so to have an effect on the victim.  The infected guy doesn't go haywire until maybe 24 hours have passed.  But that was enough time for him to get his woman pregnant... which is even weirder because I guess that the black goo infects your sperm or something.  The women gets pregnant with some freaky octopus looking alien thing.<br /><br />Let's explore the alien octopus pregnancy for a minute.  When the android finds out, he tries to force the woman to carry the fetus to term.  Why?  Again, who knows.  Was the android trying to impregnate humans with alien fetuses?  I don't think so.  Did the android know that infecting the dude would also infect the dude's sperm and impregnate a woman with an alien fetus.  I don't think so.  Ok... so what is the android trying to accomplish?  I can't say really.<br /><br />Well, the woman freaks of course and breaks into a special room on the ship which contains a surgical chamber like something you would see on Star Trek.  Wait a minute... how did she get in there?  Wasn't that area off limits?  Wasn't it locked or something?  Nevermind... so the woman gets in the surgery unit and has the alien octopus fetus cut from her womb.  She then gets stitched up and stumbles back out into the ship.<br /><br />Question - how do people react when they see this nearly naked woman stumbling around with a big incision across her abdomen?  How do they react?  They don't react at all!  They are just like \\"Hey... how's it going\\" or something.  In fact, she somehow wanders into a room where the android and the gang are waking up the really old man who secretly funded the mission.  They don't react to her at all... even the android who knew she had been pregnant.  WTF?<br /><br />Now the film gets really dumb.<br /><br />The super old dude planned the whole trip because he wanted to meet these aliens.  Therefore, the android suits him up and they enter the alien facility in order to wake one from 2,000 years of hibernation.  The alien, of course, freaks on everyone, kills the old dude, and rips the android's head off.  Uhhhh.... Anyone else wondering why they didn't wake the alien guy up ahead of time?  Is there any particular reason why the old dude felt he needed to be standing right in front of the alien the minute they woke him up?  Didn't anyone think that a little caution was warranted?  After all, apparently the team had already figured out that this facility was an alien outpost for the production of a biological weapon (the captain just threw out that thought at random).  Apparently the android had already figured out that the ship was supposed to have traveled to Earth.  Ok then...so if you know all that, why are you sending a 100 year old man to stand right in front of the alien the minute you wake him up?  Does that make any sense at all?<br /><br />To make a long story short - alien activates ship and attempts to take off.  We assume he is heading to Earth in order to destroy the human race with the biological weapon.  Therefore, the captain of the human team pilots the human spaceship into the alien spaceship and destroys them both - causing the alien ship to crash back to the surface.<br /><br />I guess that the whole human kamikaze thing really ticked the alien dude off, so he comes out looking for the human woman - since she is the only person left alive.  He tracks her into the escape pod section of the ship (which is really a large apartment) and gets caught by the alien fetus that the woman cut out of her womb a few scenes earlier.  Except this isn't just a little octopus fetus anymore, now it is giant.  I'm kind of wondering how in the heck it got so big so fast.  I'll defer on the accelerated growth rate, but any idea what this thing was eating?  How do you get that big without eating something?  The fetus thing was locked in the medical room.  What did it eat in there? Ahhhh... nevermind....<br /><br />Regardless... one dead alien dude later, the woman goes back into the alien spaceship in order to retrieve the android's decapitated head (which is still working).  Then, for some unknown reason, she decides they need to find another alien ship and travel to the alien home world.  I'm thinking... oh... maybe that makes sense... perhaps she wants to infect the alien home world with the biological weapon.  Ahhhh... no.  She says she wants to visit in order to ask them \\"why\\".  Why did they create humanity and why did they want to destroy it?<br /><br />Dumb.  Let me get this straight.  You just blew up your own spaceship in order to prevent an alien ship from reaching Earth.  Now you decide it would be a good idea to travel to the alien home world to ask them questions?  Did you ever consider that this would be just drawing attention to yourself?<br /><br />Also, what have the aliens been doing for the last 2,000 years?  Apparently the facility was 2,000 years old.  So if the aliens were trying to wipe out humanity, then why didn't they just send another ship?  Was this the only facility of its kind?  Even if it was, do they not have any other weapons?  What?  Was nuking Earth too complicated for them?  How about tossing an asteroid our way?  What's the deal?<br /><br />Final thought.  The human scientists determine that the alien DNA is exactly the same as human DNA.  It is?  Have you seen the alien dude?  Does it look like he has identical DNA to you?  I mean... besides the fact that he is twice the size of a normal person, has black eyes, pasty skin, crazy muscles, etc.  Oh yeah... other than that we are identical!  Right.  We have more in common with a chimp than that alien dude.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If I ever decided to subscribe to cable again or own a large flat screen tv, it would be because of Walking Dead.  But, for now, I am satisfied watching it over the internet.  This show is amazing.  We really get to know these characters.  And, boy was I shocked when two, possibly three main characters got killed off early on in the season (did they ever show what happened to Sophia's mom? Last I saw was her running away and the others found her head scarf and assume she is dead, but I never saw what happened).  Aside from the guts and gory, I appreciate that the creators make this show believable. We feel the emotions of the characters, settings, and scenes, and we are able to imagine what it would be like to be in a similar situation.  The writers show us what it is like when society breaks downs and shows what people are capable of doing in desperate situations and how they are able to go about their daily business with all the mess that is exploding around them.  Awesome show.  I look forward to each episode.  I really want to know who is calling on the phone in the last episode...
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|I have to give this film 2 stars because the characters don't act in a realistic manner.  Simply put, this movie follows a group of complete idiots through the woods while they are chased down by wolves.<br /><br />A question - if you were stranded in the wilderness and being hunted by wolves, what would you do?  Think about this for a few seconds... If you and a handful of other people were stranded as a group and threatened by wolves, what is one of the first things you would do?<br /><br />MAKE SOME WEAPONS!<br /><br />That's what you would do.... Well, at least it is what I would do.  And somehow, the characters in this film fail completely in doing that.<br /><br />I'll give them credit for trying it once.  They stick some shotgun shells on the ends of pointed sticks and then jab a wolf with them.  That works once.  Then... I suppose... they just give up on making any weapons whatsoever.<br /><br />Dude!  You have at least one knife!  Sharpen some sticks and make some spears!  You are in the woods surrounded by trees.  Can no one find a stick?  You can come up with a way to ignite a shotgun shell with a stick, but you can't figure out a way to actually sharpen a stick?<br /><br />Heck, just be lazy about it, grab a big stick, and use it like a club.  I don't care what you do, but do something.<br /><br />So when the group leaves the site of the plan crash, what do they bring along for weapons?  Nothing.  When they are wandering the woods, what do they do for weapons?  Nothing.  As the group's numbers dwindle and there are even less to defend themselves, what do they do for weapons?  Nothing.<br /><br />Rather than making any attempt to defend themselves, the solution is always \\"Ahhhhh!!!  Wolves!!!!  Run!!!\\"  Then they run around until someone gets eaten.  Brilliant.  Oh yeah, and there always just happens to be one person lagging behind the group.  Gee... I wonder what is going to happen to him???  Hmmmm...<br /><br />Back to the weapons issue.  For Christ's sake - they came out of a plane crash site.  There is bound to be sharp scraps of metal all over the place.  Grab some of it and tie it to a stick.  Nope... too complicated I guess.  Instead, they run around gathering dead people's wallets.  What?  No time to grab a lead pipe or something?  The Neanderthals figured out how to tie a sharp stone to the end of a stick, but modern man can't find a single thing to make a weapon out of at a plan crash site?<br /><br />Speaking of the crash site... one of the main reasons they leave the crash site is to escape the wolves.  Where do they go?  Into the woods.  Yes, into the woods.  Is anyone actually shocked that (surprise!) they find that there are actually wolves in the woods?  It's like trying to avoid sharks by jumping into the water.  Ahhhh!!! Sharks what shall we do?  Hurry everyone, grab some supplies and get into the water!<br /><br />That is so stupid I wanted to cry, but I was too busy vomiting between the couch cushions.<br /><br />Oh - and on the way from the crash site to the woods, one guy falls behind and is attacked.  The wind is raging, snow is blowing, and everyone is panicked.  The wolves mangle him and leave him for dead.  Then, when the rest of the group approaches the body, suddenly there is no wind... no snow... nothing.  Wow... the crazy blizzard just stopped by some miracle!  Go back and watch and tell me that is not stupid.  That is some bad film editing.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Another amazing album from the deftones. Can't expect anything else from these guys when they havent had one single bad album. keep on rocking guys
B007EECSFA|4.0|Yet another story about WWII, but I admit I enjoy them.  This one was a mystery and love story that kept me engaged through the book.  I would recommend it to others.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is  a very good book, and it is  well worth the  Amazon  price.  It was the first book I bought for my Kindle reader.I have read other books on the Seals and this story fits  in  with the others. I can't think  of why the author is being harassed.  The Seals did not kill everyone..they over there are intellegent enough to reconstruct  how  the operation went....the only secret I can think of is they want to  keep us from learning  about it!
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Very well written and held my interest from the first few pages.  It was also informative on customs and living in India. I very much enjoyed the book.  It was my book club selection and provided many topics for discussion.
B00A3OJ3CO|4.0|It's a comic! Yes it is.<br /><br />There are two hunky, built guys who team up to be the hero(s). There are impossible gadgets and unbelievable skills/talents. There is black and white and grey all over the place, the #1 hero is also an anti-hero, if you like that.<br /><br />It is very like Batman, a billionaire playboy faking it, hiding who he really is after surviving a life threatening/transformative experience, a girl who has looks, is fighting for the down trodden and helpless, and is too good to be true, who the hero is in love with but must hold at a distance.<br /><br />Unfortunately it is exhausting, too. Because it is a comic book and that means manic and frantic.<br /><br />The characters are for the most part one dimensional, always knowing the best for each other, where most conversations are verbal combat, and those who know nothing of the truth think they know best. Self-righteousness abounds.<br /><br />But if you can suspend reality, if you want some mindless fun, and something to root for without thinking too hard. A flashback to 1950's view of justice.... This is the show for you. Just don't look too deep. Or expect too much fine entertainment. It is just supposed to be gruesome, over the top, pontificating fun. And it pretty much succeeds. If that is not enough...just look at all the pretty people!
B000GCFX3Q|5.0|I love Keye's books and this one is one of her good ones. I read it in 2 days. it is a real pleasure to read Walsh family adventures
B009KYXEY6|1.0|I bought this CD through the Amazon seller and of course just like many others it was missing the three tracks. I am utterly disappointed considering I already have the Born To Die CD, I really don't need two. If I knew this was going to be the case I would've just bought the Paradise EP. Also the fact that I paid expedited shipping so I could have this CD before I went on my road trip really sucks because I could've saved that money by just buying it at Target.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|This movie is not what I expected.  I waited until it came out on Blu-ray and I am quite a SiFi buff.  It was entertaining and unless it bombed at the box office it left the door open for sequels.  I am more of a Star Trek person when it comes to space movies but this kept me interested enough that I would go see a sequel. Special effects were really done well.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Simple and fun. and there is always a better way which keeps it as engaging as uptight feathered flying animals. great for kids.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I couldn't put this one down. It has a beginning that draws you in, a middle that keeps you guessing and an ending that has a feel good factor.  Well done Lee.
B004NIFK9Q|5.0|The author gets into people's heads.  It's a nice psychological piece.  I also like the turn of the century time period in England to better give me an idea of how people were there and then.  The book was interesting, educational and a bit different for me.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love playing Bingo. Bingo Blitz is nearly perfect. It's a lot of fun and very addicting. It's easy to gain money and other perks. The only objection I have is that each particular Bingo round ends too quickly. So quickly, that when the last number is called, you don't have time to enter it on your bingo card(s); even if it's a winning number!  I play this game often though and enjoy it immensely.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This was a great story, I thought it was going to be childish based on the marketing for the in theater release, bit was anyrhing but. I'm hoping for a sequel.
0525953728|5.0|Let me start off by saying that \\"No Easy Day\\" is a great book and one of the best I have ever read. Although the title is \\"the firsthand account of the killing of Osama Bin Laden\\", it isn't really about that. It is mostly about the time in the Navy Seals, from 1998 when he was in BUD/S (basic underwater demolition/seals) training all the way up to when he was a team leader on the mission that killed Bin Laden. Usually when I read a book I will read a chapter or two and then put the book down, but with this book I couldn't put it down because I wanted to see what would happen next and couldn't wait until the next night.<br /><br />The author was able to make the book very interesting for some things that would usually sound boring. He really shows you are the much training and work he had to do to get to where he was. He emphasizes that when they had to do a mission that could take as little as a half hour, they had to do weeks of training, and for the Bin Laden mission, they had to do months of training in a replica of the house for a mission that was supposed to take only 38 minutes. Also, the author talks about some of the struggles he went through. For example, during training, everyone had to make a list of the five best and worst in training, which the training leader would use to make the weekly cuts. Another example is the time you have to be away from home and not being able to tell your family where you are, what you are doing or when you will be home.<br /><br />In addition to the interesting parts, there were also many parts that lacked in suspense. Some of that is shown when he is in training. The author would go on about how they had to go through the \\"kill house\\" so many times a day and that sometimes there would be high ranking people watching. Also, while waiting for the order to do the Bin Laden mission, he was just waiting around and talking to the other guys.<br /><br />To sum it all up, this is one of the greatest books I have ever read and i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good and suspenseful action/adventure book.
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|Countdown to Extinction: 20th anniversary...hard to believe! I decided to buy this because the original mix was remastered (not the 2004 remix) and the live disc. The remaster sounds crisp and clean. The live disc is just phenomenal! It really captures the Megadeth experience of that era. Generally I'm not too fond of live recordings but there are exceptions! The original pressing is out of print as all you see on the market now are the 2004 remixed/remasters. So if you don't have the original, get this! You will not be disappointed!
0375842209|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  While considered a young adult book, it should be read by all ages.  Extraordinary prose, unforgettable characters and a story that stays with you long after you've read it.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|Ok, permissions are not horrendous, there are just 2...keep your phone awake, and a hardware control in order to vibrate.<br /><br />The game consists of 2 days, 7  levels on the first one, and 4 on the second one. Each level introduces a new animal...or bad guy, and each level must be played 15 times. You get a new ice shape each of the 15 times.<br /><br />You get coins for each time you cut an ice shape. The coins can be used to purchase a new item that I think you can use to help you. You can't purchase coins (which I think is a smart idea).<br /><br />You can turn off the music and there is a button to end the game as well. Overall, not bad.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|WOW. I knew \\"RED\\" was going to be amazing. Don`t be surprised if this is the top record of all time.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I'm not a writer, but an avid reader.  Once I got caught up in the Kay Scarpetta series, I couldn't put them down.  The Bone Bed was no different.  My only disappointment is that I have to wait for the next one.  Keep em coming.
B005LAII08|5.0|Wonderful story line! Great characters! Great movie for mothers and daughters to see together! At the end I even cried a little bit! My family and I really got caught up in the story. Can't wait to get the blu-ray and see it again!
B003DT19F0|4.0|Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue pleasantly surprised us.  I ordered it to play for our 2-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter when she came to spend a week with us.  She loved it and watched it at least once a day.  The animation, voice-actors, dialogue, and storyline are engaging.  I caught even Grandpa paying attention.  :-)  Our little fairy (that's what she was for Halloween) took the video home with her to watch again and again.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|Good quality.it worked very well with my Samsung smart tv.I am a big bones guy and this was the easiest way to watch it at home.
0307472590|5.0|Ruiz Zafón tiene la habilidad de introducirnos en una novela donde su trama de misterios nos cautiva de principio a fin. Un libro que definitivamente tiene que estar en nuestra biblioteca. Lo recomiendo.  También recomiendo: El prisionero del cielo, Ángeles custodios, [[ASIN:B006H9QUGG Resurgir de la esvástica, El (Ebook) [Versión Kindle]]] y El dedo de Dios. Todos buenos.
B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|This movie started a tad slow but as it got going I found it creepy and suspenseful. It's refreshing to view a contemporary horror film that doesn't inundate you with a non-stop gore fest for once. This film plays on the fear of the unseen...just around the corner!! Excellent acting as well.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app because I LOVE reading!!!  It is very easy to read books with this app.  The only problem I have with it is a lot of times it will not load on my android phone but I don't know if that is my phone or the app's fault.  It doesn't happen with anything else though.
1613821670|3.0|Frankenstein was originally planned to be a short story. On the one hand, it's good that Shelley expanded it into a novel, otherwise the monster might never have become the iconic king of monsters that he is. On the other hand, some of the \\"filler\\" she used to accomplish the needed length is pretty bad. Like when Dr. Frankenstein, before beginning his creation of a bride for the monster, takes a few months off to go on vacation with a friend...Huh? Or even worse, when the monster is telling his tale about his encounter with a cottage family in the woods, he (Shelley) veers off into a detailed history of the girlfriend of one of the characters, relating adventures that take place in a another country and with a whole new set of characters that seem to belong in another book.<br /><br />There is an excellent abridged version of Frankenstein in \\"[[ASIN:1479193224 Classic Monster Novels Condensed]]\\" which trims these sluggish diversions and gives the overall narrative a faster pace that makes for more effective drama. (This book also includes a very good abridgement of \\"Dracula\\", another overdone classic.)
B0086700CM|5.0|My grandkids love this game!!!  I can't keep my phone because when they come visit they always want to play Temple Run!!!
B005FISBV2|5.0|Another great season of Dexter. I love this show and glad to see they are moving it along and not just doing the same thing over and over again. If you have never seen Dexter then start from the begning and watch you will love it.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Brave is one of the first original Pixar movies that just did not seem to have a very ... well thought out Storyline.  By the  end of the film I literally turned to my wife and said, \\" what exactly was the story of this movie? \\".  Really, here is the story.<br /><br />The lead character is a princess who does not want to get married to a suitor ( never heard that one before ) and her mother \\" trains \\" her for this moment.  She doesn't like this at all, so she goes to a witch who gives her a cake that will \\" change her mother \\".  Yeah, the kid was that vague with what she wanted the witch to do.  Well, the mom is \\" changed \\" and then the kid is real sorry and goes on a hunt for a cure.  During the process, we see that the kid is very good with a Bow.<br /><br />That is about it for the storyline.  Easily the weakest part of the film.  The best part, well, is everything else.  The animation is wonderful to behold on our Samsung 40' LED 120Hz tv.  Everything is as you would expect from a new Pixar film.  The voice acting is very much up to par.  The music is ... ok.  I don't like the live singing and all that but I guess you can deal with it.<br /><br />This is one of the weakest original Pixar film's yet but that means it is still better then most of the other stuff out there already or coming soon in the CG animation department.<br /><br />Worth your buy?  Up to you.  I will likely add it to our collection though, just as another show-off film to friends and family who drop in.

I love George Winston and have listen to him for years. Music is one of my greatest pleasures. I will continue to add Ludovico Einaudi music, to my collection.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|i work off shore for 4 weeks straight at a time, and this gaming case has been my lifesaver..some of the other reviews which share dislikes for this product are valid, as far as 'used the cheapest materials to manufacture', but the pros definitaley outway the cons..i am completely satisfied with this case
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|Just a little obsessed with this series, it's like hot chocolate on a cold winter's day, a sweet and satisfying indulgence.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book (among 14 others) while stranded in the mountains enjoying nature with my family. I was annoyed to find this was the last book in the pile available to be read (pickings were slim towards the end of th week) as I had worked hard to avoid the Hunger Games craze. It had struck me a lot like the Twilight fetish had. 6 pages into the book, I was snared and captured. I was swept body, heart, and soul into the Games, rooted for those I came to love and relishing the death of others. While the alternate view of America takes a bit to slip into, the characters are rich, vivid and relatable. Pick this book up; you won't be able to put it down!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very simple and easy to play yet it is very entertaining and you can play it many times without getting bored.
0316228532|1.0|You spent the whole time reading the book waiting for the dismal characters to resolve their issues in a positive manner... only to be dissapointed...
B005IGDW24|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching this movie over and over again with my kids. There is a good balance of kid and adult humor. I would definitely recommend.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|My son-in-law is a huge Star Wars fan and wanted to get my new born granddaughter started on her love of Star Wars early.  He has watched all 3 movies with her and is sure she loved them (she is only 2 months old).
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This app had me from the first touch. The imagery and information is accurate as well as beautiful. You can't go wrong as it's well worth the price and gives so much more. Installed on my Motorola Xoom, Asus Transformer, Transformer Prime, HTC Incredible II and Nexus 7. All devices function excellently and run smoothly without compromising speed or imagery. Wondering if this designer has made one for the sun as well.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies ever made.  I mean seriously did the actors even read the script when they agreed to be in this ridiculous film.  I am grateful that I didn't spend my money on this junk.  I watched about half of the movie with a friend and couldn't take another minute of it.  It's just SO bad on SO many levels. Actually saying it's bad is a massive understatment.  It's awful.  It actually deserves no stars, but that's not an option.
B003YBNREI|5.0|Great CD!!  Quality was superb. Would buy again and again.  Wish all my purchases were this positive.  And this good!
B005EWDA9M|4.0|J'ai lu plusieurs autres romans de cet auteur. A vrai dire je trouvais que j'en avais fait le tour. Ces deux premiers tomes ne devraient pas me plaire car rien n'est expliqué. Je suis du genre à aimer le mystère résolu. Rien de tout ça ici. Et pourtant ça m'a plu. Je pense qu'on rentre dans un monde à part comme en hypnose. Et ça fascine. En route pour le troisième tome.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I thought even if this book wasnt that good I could enjoy it.  Not.  Seriously it is bad.  as another reviewer most aptly put it - it was a double tap to my head.  Average over 2 stars is just brain dead.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I didn't know what to think about this one at first, but just keep reading-it'll be worth it. I started to really care about the characters and their plight. Very original. Recommended.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I don't normally read these fantasy/adventure type books, but this one was awesome. I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed the characters and the plot. I thought it was going to get cheesy but it straddled the line, which I love. If you read fantasy...read this.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|I have a Vizio VTAB1008 tablet and this application used to install and run just perfectly.<br /><br />I had to recover from an issue and found that I can no longer install this application.  My wife has the same model tablet but the application is running fine on hers so she may have a previous version installed.<br /><br />It's horrible for an app that I paid for in the past no longer installs all of a sudden.
B008KGPEQG|4.0|Grade: B<br /><br />L/C Ratio: 80/20<br />(This means I estimate the author devoted 80% of his effort to creating a literary work of art and 20% of his effort to creating a commercial bestseller.)<br /><br />Thematic Breakdown:<br />50% - Memoir<br />20% - Aging<br />15% - Family<br />10% - New York<br />  5% - Paris<br /><br />I first got hooked on Paul Auster's writing when I read City of Glass in a college English course. Ever since then, I've found him to be one of the most innovative and engaging voices in modern American literature. For the most part, that genius carries over into his latest work of nonfiction, Winter Journal.<br /><br />There are two things that elevate Winter Journal and differentiate it from standard memoir fare. The first is the narrative approach. Auster employs the second person throughout the book, and the focus on \\"you\\" really draws the reader into the text. The other key element is Auster's choice of anecdotes. He devotes very little of Winter Journal to talking about his own books or his writing career. There are no stories about publishing deals or book signings or crazy literary fans. Instead, he turns the memoir into a fascinating study of himself as a human being and a reflection of his own aging process.<br /><br />Winter Journal has moments of pure poetry, but the strength of Auster's commentary fades a bit down the stretch. Some of his techniques (such as describing a poignant moment from each house he's ever lived in) work well, while others (such as the long list of foods he enjoyed as a child) are unnecessary. But Winter Journal succeeds in the most important way - it fosters an intimate connection between the reader and author.<br /><br />Noteworthy Quote:<br /><br />You think it will never happen to you, that it cannot happen to you, that you are the only person in the world to whom none of these things will ever happen, and then, one by one, they all begin to happen to you, in the same way they happen to everyone else.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|You are in for a treat of action, thrill, witty humor, and a great cast when you go to put in Joss Whedon's, The Avengers. With my honest opinion, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, not only in the theaters, but in the comfort of my humble abode. The thrill and action alone was enough to feed my adrenaline need.  Along with the right amount of humor to feel like this movie was down to Earth, yet ready to avenge this Earth. The Avengers had me hooked.<br />To start off, it takes talent and a great cast to execute the plot so marvelously. There is nothing like the band of six great Marvel superheroes coming together to help save our serenity and sanity. First off, there was the mischievous and ever cunning Black widow, played by Scarlett Johansson. Second, there was the dexterous and skilled Hawkeye, played by Jeremy Renner. Thirdly was the classic honorable, noble and strong Captain America, played by Chris Evans. Thor, God of thunder and lightening, holding firmly in his hand the hammer of which only he has the power to hold, is played by Chris Hemsworth. Along with, the doctor who transforms into the monstrous and terrifying Hulk, who destroys the enemy, is played by Mark Ruffalo. And of course, there was the intelligent and egotistical Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr.  They must all be ready to battle and defeat the maniacal and manipulative Loki, the brother of Thor played by Tom Hiddleston. With the mesh and finely stitched together cast, molded into the brilliant and original Marvel superheroes, the movie was well enough alone already.<br /> Furthermore, the plot was well executed and flowed seamlessly flawless. With the beginning grasping your attention and feeding the need of your wonder, it almost seemed impossible to not finish it to the end. While in between it all it offered enough suspense to never make your mind linger and enough adventure to make you feel like you were with them, rooting for The Avengers to take home the gold medal. Finally,the ending of it all, left you satisfied because they had fought the good fight.<br />  Lastly, the amount of effort and time put into this movie is greatly shown through the CGI, the music, and the setting of it all. The CGI's blended so perfectly together with the setting that it did not cross your mind that this world they created was a fluke put together pixel by pixel. The amazing planet from which Loki and Thor roamed seemed to hold me in amazement. The creatures from space and, and the awesome Hulk, looked so life like you forgot you were watching something created by humans. The music was intriguing and the backdrop was your classic Manhattan city, which never seems to fail. With that in mind, I highly recommend that you purchase The Avengers, pop a buttery bag of popcorn, grab your favorite person, and sit down for a night to remember.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Very good and easy to use. Sync my Kindle and notebook by it self. I am using the free version.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I am a hobby user. I'll say that up front. I'm not a designer or a modeler or anything like that. I do have a few modeling programs, but I mostly use this device in Poser Pro 2012. To be honest, I was kind of down on Poser before that because posing always took so long. I see now that this was because I didn't have one of these. It really helps when it comes to speeding up my workflow. Now when I'm working with models and props, my left hand stays on the Spacenavigator, while I'm using the regular mouse with my right. It took me about 15 minutes to get the hang of moving it around, but once I did, it was like flying a camera through the scene. It cut my time to pose a model down to a few minutes versus a couple of hours because you're constantly having to go to the left panel, move the camera, try to get a good view of the body part or prop, then turn back to the pose controls. The Spacenavigator really did away with all those headaches. It does require a little practice to be able to move slowly so you have to develop a light touch, but that doesn't take away from the device's performance.<br /><br />They have higher dollar versions, but I think if you want something to try out, then buy this one first before thinking of buying the 3-400 dollar ones. It will give you an opportunity to see the difference for a price that doesn't devastate your wallet.<br /><br />I'm buying the laptop version to take with me, I like it so much...
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Best sleep app ever! I've tried several others, but they sound harsh and artificial. This app's sounds are natural and soothing. I also use it at work to drown out my noisy office mates. Love it!!!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I only have one beef with Susan Boyle, and that's that she's stayed hidden from us for so long. I became a major fan when I first saw her audition for \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" on YouTube. When she opened her mouth to sing, what a rush!!! I have all four of her albums in my collection and in my iPod, and this, her fourth venture, is by far her finest effort. Susan has one of the purest voices I've ever heard. And listening to this disc proves her superstar status is no mere fluke.<br /><br />This CD opens with \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\". Now, if you expect to hear a clone of the Judy Garland version from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", you're not gonna get it. Susan makes this song her own. The lush sound of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is the perfect backing for Susan's emotive rendition of this Harold Arlen classic. Next track, and my favorite from the album is<br />\\"The Winner Takes It All\\", made popular by ABBA in 1980 and featured in the musical \\"Mamma Mia\\". Comparing Agnetha Faltskog's vocal to Susan's may not be exactly fair, but Susan delivers this song with far more emotion in her voice than Agnetha's version. Also being an ABBA fan, I wasn't exactly objective here. But my vote goes to Susan.<br /><br />Other reviews have touched on the other songs on this CD, but I have to also mention Susan's stunning rendition of \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\". Any song that can bring this grown man to tears has to be something truly amazing, and this track did just that. It's absolutely a song that was made for her.<br /><br />There were also some songs that featured duets with Michael Crawford and Donnie Osmond. They're great, but I would say that Susan could have handled these songs perfectly well by herself. Just my opinion.<br /><br />I must also commend the recording engineers here, too. This is one of the finest sounding CD's I've heard in some time. The mix is superb. I'd truly love to hear this as a 5.1 surround recording. Hey, Columbia, this one deserves the SACD multichannel treatment.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|To most people familiar with Marvel, The Avengers is the long awaited movie of the year; with its beautiful cinematography, unbelievably funny and well-written script. This slick, fast-paced action movie was well worth the wait. The story is that Loki, a god, wants to use the Tesseract to overpower the earth and take over the world, so Nick Fury assembles a team of super heroes known as The Avengers to help save the world and the people in it. While the storyline seems to be a little cliché that is what makes the movies so classic and well loved by all of its fans.  Joss Whedon effectively brings together all the plots from the other movies to put together a fantastic movie suitable for all ages.<br />And nothing makes this move more than the classic characters that everybody loves; Tony Stark, the Iron Man, in his usual arrogant, sarcastic, and self-absorbed character; Captain America, the righteous and justice seeking man; and of course you have the Hulk, still trying to control the rage from the monster, which ultimately is beneficial when it comes to smashing Loki onto the floor multiple times, easily one of the funniest scene in the whole movie. And they bring in Agent Romanoff a.k.a the Black Widow and Agent Barton a.k.a Hawk Eye, which were new to me since for the most part since I am unfamiliar with most of the movies. But they both help in developing the movie and making The Avengers more complete. Overall, the characters work well together and are excellent together, making it easy to understand their roles.<br />It touches not just one category of movie, but several that exemplify this movie even more.  And if you are a lover of superhero movies, aliens, gods, and such, then this is the movie for you. Not to mention the outstanding soundtrack that marries with the scenes of the movie brilliantly; the script is also well-written sprinkled and also sprinkled with humor, the actors deliver their lines with impeccable talent. And of course, the stunning cinematography just adds to the already remarkable script and story, making it all the more better.  To some people The Avengers is one of the best super hero movies in a long time, and I would have to agree. Seeing as how picky I am about the movies that I choose to watch, I would not mind watching this movie a second or third time.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Loved her on Idol and she just gets better.  She's helped write a lot of these songs  which really impressed me.  Two Black Cadillacs is one of the best I've heard in a while.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|After an attack from a French warship seriously damages his ship, Captain Jack Aubrey is tron between duty and friendship. He must choose to carry out his orders or chase a virtual ghost across the sea. He embarks on a high speed chase where the stakes are the lives of his shipmates.<br /><br />This is a great movie. When I saw it I found out that it is a book series. It's one of the few times that I read a book for a reason other than getting a grade. It's actually a pretty extensive series. You need a shopping cart if you're gonna go out and buy all the books. This movie is so intriguing that I can't believe a sequel hasn't been made yet. This movie has everything. Action, drama, suspense, and a bit of comedy. It gets your attention right off the bat and keeps it til the very end. It's a magnificent film worth having.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Okay game, but it costs money to get the diamonds you need for energy, etc.<br />So far there haven't been any glitches or bugs though like some of the other free games.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Love this movie!! Always have, always will.  A must-see classic!  Had the VHS version so I was very happy to get my hands on the DVD.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|The Time Keeper is classic Mitch Albom, keeping readers reminded of what is important in life, which usually ends up being the little things that we fail to pay attention to.  In this book, Albom reminds us that in our busy lives we easily lose track of time and, essentially, all that is important.  You can wish for more time, you can wish time would stop--you can even try to cheat time--but in the end, making the most of the time we have, along with everyone who shares our time with us, is what really counts.
B000WGYMAQ|5.0|I love the movie and stage show RENT. The Blu Ray disk provides much better sound and picture quality than the DVD disk I have. I'll be buying BluRay from now on !
0307744434|5.0|I admit I bought this book based on nothing more than the blurb on the back and my liking of the cover art. I have never been so glad of a spur of the moment purchase. From page one I was hooked. The author's rich descriptions and colorful characters immerse you so thoroughly, that like one of the circus patrons, you are loathe to find the book has ended and the dream over. I can only say that this novel is one I would recommend to a fan of any genre without reserve. And while I would love to read more in this universe, I'll be first in line for whatever the author pens next.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Absolutely Loved Game of Thrones - it's going to be way too long before I'll be able to see the 2nd season - I can't believe some of the amazing twists and turns - what a great story
B005OCHOZS|3.0|I liked the book and I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Scott's journey as a runner.  I wish he would have talked in more detail about his eating regime.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|An absolutely brilliant and consuming story, I can't wait to read the next book! My thanks to Suzanne Collins for writing such an original story *****

B00003CXTG|3.0|I OWN THIS MOVIE ON SPECIAL EDITION DVD THE FILM COMPANY REALLY DID A GREAT JOB THE MOVIE SHOWS A REAL HISTORY IN THE USA..HOW EVER IF U ARE LOOKING FOR THE BLU RAY EDITION IS JUST A BIG WASTE OF MONEY..I DONT KNOW HOW THEY DID IT BUT IS THE SAME QUALITY AS THE REGULAR DVD..A FRIEND OF MINE PAID $14 DOLLARS FOR THE USED BLU RAY SOONEST IT CAME OUT..THINKING THAT IT WAS GONNA SOUND AND LOOK BETTER..FROM WHAT I SAW IS ALL THE SAME QUALITY NO CHANGES.
B0015DWLD0|3.0|A novel depicting class warfare in modern India told with much irony.  Much sympathy is garnered for the protagonist.  You can't help but like the murderer.
1400069289|5.0|This book is fantastic - I could not put it down. Charles Duhigg really did his research and provided lots of pertinent examples for a very thought-provoking presentation. He explains how habits are formed, and most importantly how to CHANGE them - with specific ideas of how to do so. He also explains how successful companies use consumers' habits to their advantage, and how the largest and most successful social movements in history are tied to social habits. In other words, this book if used correctly has the potential to make you successful in every area of your life. Absolutely indispensable knowledge for anyone looking to \\"get ahead.\\"
0143120255|5.0|I´m very happy with this book! Is a perfect book for coffee table. Really recommend it! I´m thinking of ordering the post cards to hang them on the wall.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Very good character development, but very slow on plot development and action.  It's taking forever to read this book!  Was expecting better.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Dull, unbelievable, and convoluted........This book was not up to the quality of most of Grisham's previous novels.  Definitely not worth the time and money to read.
1936608618|5.0|Awesome book!  This is, without a doubt, the most comprehensive book on the subject that I have read.  I attended a CrossFit Endurance certification in 2011 and this provided a much more in-depth analysis and explanation of the key concepts that we learned at the seminar.  The book is clearly well thought out, organized, and tons of pictures from a variety of angles helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the system.  We are in the process of implementing an endurance program at my gym and this will definitely be the go-to reference for my coaches and I.  If you told me you could only buy one book on endurance training this year, I would send you straight to this out to get this one!  Thanks to Brian and the CrossFit Endurance crew for developing such a comprehensive guide to endurance training!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I own all her albums and I love them all. I didn't think she could top her previous three studio albums, but this new one sure did top them all.  I was blown away, her voice got so much stronger, she must had some sort of trainings. I couldn't find one song I don't like from this album.  I have been listening to this album on repeat for 2 days.  Very addictive and love the timbre of her voice.  I hope she will release an album every year.
0062206281|4.0|Definitely read the first two installments of the \\"Cemetary of Forgotten Books\\" series before delving into t his one even though they are different stories. This one goes back in time and still delights the reader with a well told story, but maybe I went into it with too much excitement as it was the weakest of the three books (but still storytelling at it's finest). Almost as captivating as the first two in the series and always great to see familiar characters. Enjoy!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I found myself completely absorbed in this book.  Couldn't put it down!  Read the entire book in one night and was sorry when I was done and couldn't wait to read the conclusion of this saga.
0307949508|4.0|This was my favorite in the series as it was a little more fast paced, though I did miss the sexiness from the first so I rate them both the same. Larsson is still smart and still drops small presents of surprise when you least expect it. If you read the first, this one is a must as well.
1118232658|4.0|The book offers an interesting insight into a topic that concerns more and more enterprises. Within our changing world the world wide web and its tools become more and more important.<br />Erik Qualman shows how enterprises has to change and invent themselves in order to succeed within this challenge.  He creates interesting metrics to underline where social media management is coming from and where it's capable to go.<br />A nice eye-opener for everyone who wants to explore that field and wants to benefit from the chances social media gives modern enterprises.
0143034901|5.0|I take the train every day and can say that I read A LOT. Despite all of the books that I have read, this has remained by #1 favorite and go to recommendation to anyone for a \\"must read\\" book. I cannot praise this enough and I have always longed for another book that would make me miss it as much as I miss this when it was over. Zafon is at  his best covering all  of my favorite genres: mystery, love, a little history, angel/devil/gothic, sex...you will want to follow these characters forever so we are lucky that Zafon has prequels/sequels. There's also something beautiful about novels that are translated from another language and this adds to the level of writing - outstanding. Truly captivating, beautiful and so sorry to see it end.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Could not decide if I should give this film two stars or three.  Went for three since it is a reasonable film for adolescents.  I like some Pixar films.  Wall-E was wonderful.  This film did nothing for me.  With all the scope of Celtic history and all the wonderful mythology in the culture why come up with a dull, predictable coming of age story.  The three suitors are just obnoxious and they have no hope of growing into desirable princes.  Merida should have married the bear that ate her dads leg.  Or the horse.....the horse was a better catch than those three doofuses.<br /><br />I guess Disney needed a new princess to market for the Christmas season.They needed a red head to stand out from the other cookie cutter princess and chose to make her Scottish so there would be a new clothing line for the dolls, costumes or whatever they are hawking this season.<br /><br />The music was the best part of the film.  I am a Julie Fowlis fan so ......at least yay for that.
0307454568|2.0|Though the book picks up right where the second leaves off, I can't say that I got through this book. Maybe I was tired of the characters (I usually love a hefty series) or maybe I just felt bogged down with excessive detail and lack of excitement in this book. There was just something that set me off so I went well into it and then just put it down and had a to take a break. I loved the first two and really looking forward to a great closer. Maybe this one is a little too cold for me, lack of love and lack of any emotion. I expected something great and still intend to try and get back into it for a third time...but the thrill is gone and I would just read it to close out this series. Sad.
0525953728|5.0|This read is simply capivating!  A real attention getter... Did not put down till I finished it, and the same is true for the other Book I got here titled \\"The Red Circle\\".. 2 books I recommend for any one with a heart beat!!!!  Thanks again! Candice S.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn at her best! Absolutely one of the most intriguing journeys into the psyche of a married couple...extremely clever and hauntingly unpredictable. I cannot find enough words to praise this novel and as an avid reader, it's hard to get a 5 star review like this. You will not be able to put this book down. As usual, a winner for Flynn that leaves you aching for her next novel. If you like mysterious, pyschological thrillers and a peek into the \\"real lives\\" of people, then this is the book for you.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Just purchased the camera app for my Kindle Fire HD but it never showed up in my APPS.  Have no way to try it out nor do I have anyone to contact to find out how.  I just waisted $1.99.
0143119680|3.0|I love a novel that I can sink into and fall in love with the characters...and a trilogy? A dream.<br /><br />This novel was very involved, detailed and somewhat historical...but I will say that I really loved the first half of this book a lot more than I loved it towards the end. I feel like Harkness didn't know how to end it and then just kept writing and writing, adding more and more detail until she realized that she had two more sequels to write.<br /><br />I do recommend this book to friends who likes the witches and vampire genre, and I did love this book, even looking forward to the second book. However, as the book approached, I realized that I didn't really want to jump back into the story of these two characters and maybe it's not as great as I thought.<br /><br />The historical references are a little bit too much, but the character build up is very good. This is the type of book that you like really based on personal preference and not too much regarding the story.<br /><br />Try it and then you will know if you love or hate it, it's worth the try.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another Flynn thriller that is complex, compelling and fun. Today's headlines brought to life. A good Rapp read with a clever twist for a next book.
0307341577|4.0|This novel will keep you disturbed for days...in a good way. Gillian Flynn captivates once again, and never lets you go. The novel switches back and forth from present day back to the night of the main characters murder and what really happened. Flynn fascinates with her talent for horrifically detailed story telling. Another page turner. Another must read.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Very fun version of angry birds. I wish you could do the jedi training without paying.  Also the large in app ads are very annoying.  works great on my driod x.
0307949486|4.0|A smart, well written novel that keeps the reader engrossed and ready for the next novel. I read the next two in the sequel so I won't delve into this story as I dont want to spoil it. But definitely a good read and exciting welcome into the world of Larsson.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Reminds you of the graphic novel a batman at 55 has to come out of retirement he does not seem to be real happy about it. The older batman is even more angry and more dangerous he is as crazy as the lowlife scum he takes on.
0316223239|4.0|I bought this book for $1 at a garage sale and despite the stellar review, the plot didnt convince me that I would find this novel to be impressive....I was so wrong. The book provides inspiration and gratitude for the life we have today, yet it's not a whining sob story. Donoghue treats this unconventional life as an alternate way of life rather than a sad sobstory and really captures the readers heart with the depth and detail of which she goes into when creating the characters and their story. Welcome to a different world which you will only realize was sad when the book is over. Something different to read which will leave you talking about it and thinking about it days after you read this novel. You won't regret the read, I would have paid full price!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|highly entertaining.  Lots of little fun things included.  Some tasks may be difficult to complete for those who don't socialize on the 'Net.
0307341550|4.0|I read this book a few years ago and still recommend it to anyone looking for an addictively amazing and dark somewhat gruesome glimpse into the life of a person. This is a psychological thriller which will keep you guessing until the very final page. Great example of how the past can come back to have it's repercussions later in life. a great introduction to Gillian Flynn's dark, twisted world of horror. Will make you wonder exactly how and where she created these ideas, not from the the normal mind.
0385536828|5.0|Lyrical, romantic and sexy, this book is a tour de force.  I am generally skeptical of writers who write about writers writing, but there is so much more here, just the perfect quantity of constrained hints of spycraft to misdirect the reader, the prose flows crisply and the details comprise a fascinating tapestry of tangled intrigue and personal turmoil.  Gently brought forth in a way that brings to mind the best of John Le Carre, while delivering in the end an insouciant flourish that joyfully brings us to the present moment.  You don't have to be an intellectual to enjoy this book, but it may encourage you to delve more deeply.  Not heavy though, the reader is immersed throughout and this book is supremely difficult to put down.<br /><br />A riveting amalgam of character study, romance, spy story and cinematic historical / political intrigue, an accomplished, well-crafted tale populated by plenty of quirky and unique characters, delicate and subtle, above all a romance as fulfilling as it is surprising, McEwan takes plenty of chances and carries us to a satisfying conclusion after acquainting the reader with a fascinating capsule of place and time through the eyes and hearts of his protagonists, definitely must read.
0062060562|3.0|The book wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything spectacular. At times it can be a little painstaking to \\"relearn\\" everything with the main character, but it's definitely worth the read. Sometimes you want something that doesn't involve too much thinking and not too fast paced. The story line was pretty good and the ending was a great one - the ending got one star alone :)
0307744434|3.0|I'm surprised at the rave reviews this book received. The story line was good, at best...entertaining but not a great novel that I would recommend for all. There wasn't much thought involved and many are right in saying that it would make for a good movie...a little cinematography would help, and i'm not a movie watcher. The writing wasn't vyer impressive and there were parts that you just wanted to get through. Consider this neither a win or loss, but something to read and then put away and be over it. Somewhat interesting but feeling kind of lukewarm about it. Plain vanilla for me but glad I read it to see what all the fuss was about.(If you want a good circus story with ALL elements and stellar writing, read water for elephants, but dont expect that kind of story out of this novel if you have read it already).
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|The UI is simple and easy to use with large number keys.  For a quick calculation, this would be ideal, but I wanted something with more functionality.  Also, I wanted to be able to see my previous calculations, like on a TI or other scientific calculator.
0345803485|2.0|The story line and types of sexuality, they were the good parts.<br /><br />The characters, especially Anastasia, very repetitive and a bit annoying.<br /><br />The writing, very unpolished and simple...leaving any thinking reader bored at times. There was no challenge at all....simple reading, I guess what one would call a beach read (but there are better ones...think: Jackie Collins, at least it's more exciting).<br /><br />If you dont think talking about sex is taboo or you are sexually comfortable and understand your own needs, then this is pretty boring.<br /><br />A book/series for the bored housewife...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love the 50 shades series! I didn't enjoy the way this ended but I loved this book so much it had so much going on so quickly. My only complaint is that it jumped months ahead in a few different chapters.
1451695195|3.0|I have been an oncology nurse for several yrs. so I feel strongly that heaven does exist. I was very curious to read a doctor's technical background and the discovery he experienced. It is a great read and I know his patients beside himself will continue to benefit from his journey to the after-life. I know I feel much more secure even though I believed prior to reading this book. It's a comfort. Thank you.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Similar to 50 shades of grey so it's a great follow up book.. Love it so much can't wait for the third!

B0061QD82E|5.0|Great movie, beautiful transfer. It has a number of neat extras. A movie that both a girl and a boy can watch and not fight over
B006OAB2XO|4.0|This album starts out with a sassy, uptempo track totally reminiscent of Tom Tom Club's Genius of Love. Immediately you will either love or hate vocalist Claire Boucher's voice. It's kind of baby-ish & girly, think of a young Bjork. It's the biggest hurdle to overcome while listening to the entire album. The tracks Genesis & Oblivion set an entirely different mood. Her voice is still baby-ish & girly, by this time though it's absolutely angelic. You will probably play these tracks more than once. The drum beats aren't annoyingly fast like most electronica music. Rather a steady pace with simple piano or keyboard loops to compliment it. The lyrics can get a bit repetitive, mostly about love. That is, if you can understand them. There is heavy use of delay effects & echoes on every song making some lyrics unintelligible. I do wish there were liner notes or a lyric sheet.  A majority of the songs only last about 4 minutes. When they each ended I found myself wanting to play them again. This woman is going to be huge!
B004LQGXPA|5.0|Classic docu-drama. The acting is top rate. The casting had one departure from reality: George C. Scott playing the title role speaks with a deep growl; the real Patton had a high pitched squeaky voice. The DVD was a high quality video.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Very much like Forest Gump in tone as well as content. Funny and well written. Great to spend a few afternoons for all ages.

0743496736|5.0|A friend suggested this book to me and just looking at it I thought it to be somewhat of a \\"girly\\" book. I gave it a try anyway and it was the best decision I had ever made. This was actually my first Jodi Picoult book and I immediately became a fan. Not only is her writing phenomenal (I felt like I was watching a move) but the story line was something I couldn't have imagined. There are a few twists and turns and by the middle of the book I felt like I knew the characters like they were my friends. Such careful detail was put into this and the end result was an extraordinary book.
B009WJ2XT6|5.0|I think this score is fantastic, it fits the tone of the film very well, gets my heart racing and tugs on my emotions when I expect it to; However, it should be noted that the traditional 007 theme is not included as its own track the way it is on the Casino Royale score (\\"The Name's Bond...James Bond\\"). Newman does an excellent job of weaving that theme into many of the other tracks for this film - most notably on \\"Breadcrumbs\\" - but it is David Arnold's \\"The Name's Bond...James Bond\\" that plays at the end of the film in theatres and as such it is not included on the Skyfall score. Just FYI so you're not disappointed if that theme is something you are particularly looking forward to on this OST.
6304698798|5.0|When i went to the video store n town, we (me and my dad) came 2 this store called Secondhand Store, as we went inside the store there were so many movies 2 choose from, so my dad pick a movie 2 watch and its called 'The Good, Bad And The Ugly producer by Clint Eastwood' but the thing is my dad wont stop watching ' The Good, Bad And The Ugly Known as  Clint Eastwood '. My dad and i give the rate of the movie of 5 stars and were the biggest fan of Clint Eastwood. We loved his shows on tv. I will purchase a copy of a dvd produce by Clint Eastwood and the VHS that we had it broke and havent buy another 1 yet.  I highly recommand anybody can purchase this dvd
1400067820|4.0|To reveal creeping determinism, or `abstract blindness' I am reminded of the WWII bombers that returned from German bomb runs.  The ones that returned were all shot-up and full of holes.  The General asked, `what can we do to protect the bombers'?  A smart mathematician said put extra armor where there are \\"no\\" holes.  Where There are No Holes!  Of course, Antifragile and the work of the author are about being aware of the unintended consequences that we can not see, or even contemplate.<br /><br />When looked thru the lens of abstract blindness, one realizes that the bombers that did not return were the ones with holes in them that no one could see.  This dove tails into the Antifragile's frequent reminder that absence of evidence (of harm), is not the same as evidence of absence -- meaning (in my view) just because there is 30 years of data that says it has never happened before does not mean it will not happen.  This is the turkey's view prior to Thanksgiving Day problem - from Black Swan.<br /><br />As for Seneca's Asymmetry, if you have more to lose than benefit from fate then you are fragile.  Seneca's practical counter to being fragile was to go through mental exercises to write off possessions, so when losses occurred he would not feel the sting.  And also use a barbell approach meaning keep the extremes on the ends and therefore avoidance is in the middle.  This fine book also has a considerable amount of discussions on health matters that range from Hormesis (think vaccines), medications that we don't need, your private doctor may be your worst enemy, non-linear activity (anti-marathon training), and much more.<br /><br />If you consider this the 3rd book in the series of Fooled By Randomness and Black Swan, then the Trilogy Was Worth The Wait.  All in a worthy book for either the philosopher's, reader's, or investor's book shelf - along with the a few below.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1400067936 Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life]]  by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (Halo Effect),<br />[[ASIN:0812979184 The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]]  by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (Economic Game Changer),<br />[[ASIN:0609809989 Ubiquity: Why Catastrophes Happen]]  by Mark Buchanan (Power Laws),<br />[[ASIN:0465043550 The (Mis)behavior of Markets]]  by Benoit Mandelbrot (A Fractal View of Risk).<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a free advance copy prior to publication.Nicholas Taleb (Halo Effect),<br />[[ASIN:0812979184 The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]]  by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (Economic Game Changer),<br />[[ASIN:0609809989 Ubiquity: Why Catastrophes Happen]]  by Mark Buchanan (Power Laws),<br />[[ASIN:0465043550 The (Mis)behavior of Markets]]  by Benoit Mandelbrot (A Fractal View of Risk).<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a free advance copy prior to publication.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out to continue the story started in Fall of the Giants. Now I can't wait for the third book of the series to come out and see how everything ends. It is a very fast read and you feel you are there as a part of the story.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|SUNKEN CONDOS is just as good as any Steely Dan greatest hits collection.  The record sounds familiar and yet brand new at the same time, not an easy trick to pull off!  Much of this has to do with the healthy dose of funk that Fagen adds to his usual repertoire.  His word play is at its best, too.  Some of the highlights include &#34;Good Stuff,&#34; that could have fit well on the soundtrack to SHAFT, and &#34;Miss Marlene,&#34; a reminiscent piece about an old girlfriend he still pines for.  Six of the nine songs on SUNKEN CONDOS are instant classics, while the remaining three are above average.  His red ball knocks all the pins down!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|this game ( even though I did'nt download this game. I can tell it is the same) it is the same as the free version that I downloaded a long time ago.
0061122416|1.0|I was excited about reading The Alchemist since I had heard so much about Coelho's book.  What a dismal, simplistic disappointment.  The quest that Santiago follows is shallow and ethnocentric.  This was not a quest for spiritual guidance, this was a male chauvinistic and Christian-based journey with flat characters sprouting cliches and meaningless mumbo jumbo.<br />  I wonder, why in the 21st Century is it only men who seek spirituallity and why are women to stay home and wait for their men?  Why does the revelation sound more like a kid taking his first communion than the acquisition of spiritual enlightenment?  Why is this poorly written book so esteemed?<br />  If you want to read a short, worthless novel, feel free to choose The Alchemist.  The book will not disappoint you.

0140120416|5.0|An earlier edition of this book was my introduction to Russian, and it was an invaluable primer to this fascinating language. And, from what I can see from peeking inside this new edition, the format has not changed that much.<br /><br />Of course, it needs to be added that this is a beginner's book, as well as that you will get the best results by using it with a teacher or tutor who is a fluent speaker. But then again, this is true of ANY self-study language course--unless one is a certified \\"genius\\" at learning languages (which is a claim very few of us can make with any truth).<br /><br />That said, if your aim is fluency my recommendation remains \\"Ultimate Russian,\\" which has both a beginner-to-intermediate course and one for advanced learners. If you are really serious about mastering Russian without actually living in a Russian-speaking area, the Ultimate Course is the way to go, while \\"The New Penguin Russian Course\\" is for those who want to \\"taste\\" the language before committing themselves.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is easy enough for my four year old and fun for me too! It is really addictive. No ads and no in app purchases. Very worth the 0.99!

B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I've used Handy Note on my KindleFire for a week now, and I love it.  There are a few very minor things that I would tweak, but nothing that keeps things from running smoothly.  The app is fast replacing the disorganized stack of papers I usually carry around.  I can copy text I need for a meeting from emails or other files, paste into a notebook, edit, bring my tablet to the meeting, then take notes at the meeting, and it is all neatly kept and readily retrievable.  Notes can be typed or handwritten using a finger or stylus, which is nice, since I hate virtual keyboards. There are various templates available for setting up pages which are well conceived and useful.  I have my Kindle with me all the time, so it's easy to keep up with tasks, meeting minutes, journal writing, etc. where ever I am.  Highly recommended!
0385536828|3.0|I found this latest novel by McEwan a big disappointment.  By using the \\"stories within a story\\" I really think he was trying to \\"plump\\" up his novel.  Seems like he didn't have enough material without padding it with these stories.  I think he could have used another ruse to illustrate Haley's point of view (required by MI5).  The shortened version would be a good short story for the New Yorker.
B003AVPV1O|4.0|This works perfectly well splitting my desktop screen and my TV. now i don't have to sit infront of the monitor but can relax on my sofa and watch the same content. i just wish it worked more independently and allowed me to view one thing on the TV while doing another on the desktop monitor. still no real complaints as now i don't have to hassle with unplugging one monitor to plug the other and vice versa.

B0090YHSFC|1.0|Installed this slighty fun/slightly boring game and git a nifty 'Search' shortcut on my homescreen that takes me to a website called searchmobileonline. Some people report their browser start pages getting hijacked by this in other instances. Would give zero stars for this underhanded crap if i ciould.<br /><br />Unfortunately, 0 reviews when I chose to diwnload it.<br /><br />The game itself is OK, I guess, but there is no way to move the penguins, they don't collide with each other, and you can't speed them up, so 95% of your time is spent staring at the screen and tapping your foot as you wait for them to all drift into the same corner.

030758836X|2.0|After reading \\"Sharp Objects\\" and \\"Dark Places\\" first and hearing rave reviews about \\"Gone Girl,\\" I was really excited to read this novel.<br /><br />It starts off promising, but then just fell completely flat.  There was nothing exciting to really hook you in this book.  Both main characters - Amy and Nick - are vile and unlikeable and ridiculous.  Almost half-way through the book and I was ready to be done with it and kill both characters off.  It was a painful read and took me forever to go through.  I was a huge fan of her other two books and had such high hopes and was extremely disappointed by this lackluster whodunit with it's anit-climactic ending.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child is one of my favorite authors.  He didn't disappoint me with this story! Always moving, always mysterious.  I think I must be in love with Jack Reacher.  BUT, Tom Cruise doesn't fit my mental image.  :(  The movie will never be as good as the book!

B006IYFCIM|5.0|I loved Dan's first two books, but this one feels like a rush to publish more books than Malcolm Gladwell.  While his conclusions about individual and group honesty resonate on an intuitive basis, most of the \\"experiments\\" used to build his behavioral models are disconnected from the real world in which decisions about honest and dishonest actions are made.  The experiments, set in universities, put the subjects into inconsequential environments in which unimportant tasks are performed.  While Dan might argue that a person's underlying sense of honesty manifest itself in all environments, his own thesis that \\"moral reminders\\" shape behavior, is largely ignored in extrapolating from the lab to the real world.  I am not suggesting people are more or less honest than Dan suggests, I don't think his experiments provide a solid basis to draw his conclusions.  Dan's writing style makes the book an easy and enjoyable read, but that is not sufficient to make it good social science.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|When I saw the TV ad which flashed on the screen rather quickly, I thought it was about \\"The History of Pi\\" by Petr Beckmann. I then looked at the Amazon holdings and realized my mistake which turned out to be a perfectly delightful mistake.<br /><br />The book produced a range of emotions from a hilarious interpretation of \\"hedging one's bet\\" on who's God could produce the best results all the way to a few tears as Pi realized his plight. But then, his courage was probably goaded into a resolve to take life one miserable day at a time, realizing that had Pi been adrift alone on the boat he might not have survived. Thus the semi-religious conclusion: God (no matter which one you choose to believe) is going to work His mysterious ways whether you like them or not. Stand back and watch!<br /><br />The book was a delightful and thought-providing romp into one young person's triumph over more challenges than he hoped ever to encounter.<br /><br />Al Strohlein<br />San Diego
1419705849|5.0|OK, I have a 10 year old daughter and a 14 year old son.  My experience with the series is limited to the movies and flipping through a few pages.  Here is our experience with the book, \\"Third Wheel.\\"<br /><br />  The moment the book arrived I had to break up a minor fight over who got the book first.  We went to a 15 minute oven timer to determine turns.  After an hour my son relented to my daughter.  She read the book, cover to cover, in the first night.  She reports it is the best book in the series.<br /><br />  My son took two days to read it.  He generally would rather read sports magazines, but thoroughly enjoyed the book.  He rates it as solid in the series, but not the best one ever (unlike my daughter).<br /><br />  Well spent money.  If you know the series I'm sure you know what you are getting.  From a Dad's perspective I like it WAAAY better than the Dork Diaries (not quite as snotty).<br /><br />  Enjoy!

Her recipes are all well tested and come out wonderfully.  The only slight disappointment is that the entree section of the book is a bit light. But she makes up for it with a killer desert section.  An extremely well done book, both visually and content wise.

B008R14YBK|5.0|Until hearing \\"Ready or Not\\" on the radio, I never heard of Bridgit Mendler. After checking out her whole album, I became a fan.<br /><br />The 19-year old Bridgit Mendler comes from the Disney Channel, but `serious' music fans or older listeners shouldn't dismiss her.  Her music is not cheesy at all. It's very pop, yes, but it incorporates jazz, soul, and real rock. Every song is well-crafted and has quality lyrics.  The production never feels generic.  Every song sounds different from the others and would stand out among other pop singer's stuff.  And Mendler has a beautiful voice with a nice texture.<br /><br />I like every song on the album. The songs are mostly upbeat and they always have a feel-good vibe. Like all Disney singers, the lyrics are always innocuous. Besides \\"Ready or Not\\", some of the better songs are \\"Top of the World\\", \\"Hurricane\\", \\"City Lights\\", and \\"5:15\\". Most of the songs could easily be performed by Jessie J, Demi Lovato or Carly Rae Jepsen.  However, \\"5:15\\" could have been performed by Amy Winehouse.<br /><br />Bridgit Mendler is an underrated artist. She deserves more exposure and fame, as she is better than most of the others on pop radio.  If you like pop music, give her a listen if you haven't already.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a must have game.  Works very smoothly and is nearly the same as on the ps3.  This game is great for the kuds but is one of my favorites.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|A very personal and honest account of Craig's life and times without being too bogged down in his own battles with drugs and alcohol.  Candid enough to be refreshing, but moves along at a great pace.  I love this guy!
B005HSL626|5.0|My grandkids grab my phone as soon as they are near me to play thus awesome game.  It  is very entertaining and loads of fun.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|There is a reason they are considered one of the greatest bands of all time.  This album is great from beginning to end, and is by no means a step backward.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|So what, it isn't as heavy...it's been 15 years! It sounds amazing. The quality is undeniable, whether you like heavy or not (And trust me when I say my most favorite version of Soundgarden was their earliest work, Chris Cornell's most primitive, screaming days). Leave the Louder Than Love expectations behind and try it! It's rare to ever buy an album anymore. Aside from Tool and a few others, I find no excitement in buying full cd's in this new millennium of autotune and vocal perfection and boring, boring boring.... This is an exception. Thank you Soundgarden for putting out something worth buying. I have not taken it out of my car since I got it. My top favorites so far are A Thousand Days Before, Blood On The Valley Floor, Bones Of Birds, and Black Saturday. Real gems! Blood On The Valley Floor is reminiscent of something from Badmotorfinger while A Thousand Days Before reminds me of something you'd hear off their final album of the 90's - Down On The Upside. Please buy it and appreciate it for what it is. And appreciate their hard rock albums for what they were to that time. It's all worthy of appreciation!
1594744769|4.0|I was immediately drawn in by the creepy vintage photo of a girl on the cover.  I couldn't wait to browse through the odd black and white photographs peppered throughout the book.  I wish more novels would experiment with images like this. These stark photos have the feel of a Victorian cabinet album, full of intrigue and a macabre side show vibe.<br /><br />Sixteen year old Jacob is set emotionally adrift after the abrupt and confusing death of his grandfather.  A mysterious letter leads him to visit the island in Wales where his grandfather lived as a child.  Jacob encounters a school of unusual children with deformities and strange skills.  Together, they work to unravel the mystery of Jacob's grandfather's life and death.<br /><br />I wasn't entirely satisfied with the story's resolution.  I feel it left too many threads unexplained.  However, I still thoroughly enjoyed the book, and would recommend it for anyone with a penchant for sideshows and oddities.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This movie is awesome.  It easily just became my favorite fighting movie.  Great story and great fight scenes.  Make sure you have time to watch it all at once bc you are not going to want to pause this.
B000000XBC|5.0|It had been years since I listened to these songs.  I play bass and guitar and I can play along with most of these songs now.  This album for me makes the capstone for this group's work.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I study communication, that's my gig.  And I thought I was pretty darn good at talking to people, particularly my fiance.  Matter of fact, I knew this theory existed and I knew the basics.  When I read this book, though, all the way through?  Turns out all I knew was the equivalent of how to count to ten in Spanish while living in Barcelona.  Oh, what an eye opener?  Sure, there are moments where it's a little cheesy, and a tiny bit dated, but the meat of the book is so well worth getting through those parts!  I give it my highest recommendation to anyone looking to carry on a Godly relationship--with anyone!  You can even extrapolate some of the theories and methods described in this book to other non-romantic relationships such as with parents, children, and friends.  I know there are books specifically for those categories but if you're a quick study and looking for one book to get the basics down?  Start here....and then go get the others anyway, because I have been humbled and educated about my knowledge of interpersonal communication once before, so it can and most definitely will happen again.
1883217040|5.0|A very concise, thorough treatment of jazz theory.  It's not for the novice by any means but even if you have just a &#34;record player&#34; education the concepts here are understandable.
B00A7OFVVM|5.0|I missed this episode on Wednesday. It was worth the $1.99 to watch it here! Another great episode with the stellar cast! This is by far my favorite show! The writers never disappoint! So Bloody Face was revealed...hmmmmmmm I knew there was something dark about him, especially with the stunt he pulled during last week's episode! ...WOW that doc really messed that girl up! ...all because she laughed at the size of genitalia. He's beyond sick! Ready for the episode!
B005N95JA4|4.0|The piece \\"Claudine\\" is hilarious if you don't take the song too seriously.  It is a true story (sort of) and fitting for today's times of \\"reality\\" entertainment if you can call it that.

0307744434|5.0|I would place myself somewhere between a cinema-phile and a ravenous reader. Luckily for me, I wasn't privy to the media hype to promote this book. I picked it up on my way through an airport. That made it an even better surprise! I will be giving this item away to several of my friends for the holidays. And, yes, it WAS a grand fantasy. But isn't every circus?! I can only hope that if it is converted to the silver screen, better care is taken in its production than with some of the trashy-hacked versions of books made in Hollywood today. Contrary to other reviews I felt it had just the right amount of style per ounce of substance. I can't wait to see what she puts out next.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!  I just wish it gave more coins a lot sooner.  plus we need something that describes the game for people who don't know about it.

B002RXVOX0|3.0|One of the better Dracula movies. A classic horror movie with an actual story... before all of the gore of the slasher genre. Cheesy 70's special effects, but overall good.

1400067820|5.0|This is an addendum to Roy Clark's reasonable review.<br /><br />You are in for a rollicking good time.<br />Nassim Nicholas Taleb is the rarest kind of genius; he has a sense of humor.<br />He jiggles joggles and dazzles with words and ideas and he seems to have fun doing it.<br /><br />He is deliciously `tongue in cheek' and often tongue (and finger extended), especially towards academics as he simultaneously makes points, illustrates, explains and tells stories and finds ways to amuse, amaze and engage.<br /><br />I began underlining and turning down pages before I realized the whole book is too rich to be read once or even ten times to savor and digest this content.<br /><br />Great lines leap from almost every page.<br /><br />I envision a later series of, shorter booklets entitled, \\"The Wit and Wisdom of Nassim Taleb.\\"<br />But that's just me.<br />He says, `...to be sophisticated you need to accept that you are not so.'<br />I aint.<br /><br />His chapter, The Souk and the Office Building: Two Types of Professions, where he compares the jobs of two brothers, one a bank employee and the other a cab driver will hit home with those who have lost and now seek a `secure job'.<br /><br />As a clinical mental health counselor I applauded the sub chapter, Crimes Against Children where he talks about physicians who prescribe psychiatric medication (especially to children) to regulate moods and reduce variability.<br />He cites the consequences...of silence... if Baudelaire Poe or Path had been medicated. (Please see my review of Tolstoy where I mention that his probable mental illness fueled his greatness.)<br />Taleb adds that, `If larger pharmaceutical companies were able to eliminate the seasons, they would probably do so---for a profit, of course.'<br /><br />Definitions:<br />`Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.<br />`...Anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks)is antifragile;' the reverse is fragile.<br /><br />`Wind extinguishes a candle and energizes a fire.'<br /><br />This book will energize you and free your imagination even as it challenges you to view your view of the world and how you live your life.dom events (or certain shocks)is antifragile;' the reverse is fragile.<br /><br />`Wind extinguishes a candle and energizes a fire.'<br /><br />This book will energize you and free your imagination even as it challenges you to view your view of the world and how you live your life.
0345529057|5.0|This is great stuff!!  I read from book to book to book and am ready to purchase the rest in the series.<br /><br />The storyline is awesome with lots of action, intrigue, thrills and chills all wrapped up into one heck of great series.  What I love most about the book is the tight storyline and deep characters.  You feel their pain and all of the rest of their emotions that most writers strive to achieve but end up falling flat.  Not so in this book.  If you like the series you will LOVE the books!<br /><br />This is also a great idea for a gift, purchasing all of the books in a nice heavy slip case.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I just got this app,  looking for something to entertain me. cute animals fighting each other?? its funny. it is entertaining and the crystal things I thought were like those cash things you have to buy,  but you don't!!  great game overall.
B0034G4ORC|2.0|This movie is a bleeding hart patriot saps movie. The movie starts off by introducing EVERY F&*%*&$ solder in here by typing his name, rank, age, and I think even his favorite color too. As if anyone cares about a fictional character's name in a fictional movie. As if you're going to remember these names at the end of the movie that fictionally died for your fictional freedom. Ok so now that that's out of the way, aliens invade, S*&^ explodes, people die, marines get their asses handed to them, they run away, Ok now the good stuff comes in. \\"Hi, my name is Not Important, this is my son, show kid to salute, bla, bla, bla.\\" Ok X-files moment here, (dissecting alien), blow more S*&^ up. Ahup, hart to hart moment with kid for 20 minutes. Shooting, killing, tie kid's shoelace while getting shot at, find home base, having long boring lecture with marines followed by choked up moment with kid again. Found mother ship, blew it up, and Michel lives to F*&^ another guy. The end.<br /><br />Honestly, they were really trying to squeeze out for that, winner for best sob movie of the year award weren't they?<br />The only reason I gave it two stars is because I would like to do miss Rodriguez. That ones for you babe.
0312370849|5.0|I loved this  book. I knew certain things about WW2 and the atrocious acts and horrors innocent  people were subjected to but I was not aware of what was told in this book. I researched it and was appalled. Nothing I read  in the past told the graphic story of women and children,I will never forget it.<br />I thought the book was very well written. I couldn't put it down. Many criticized this book  for its style of writing, the portrayal of certain characters and maybe the story wasn't plausible<br />This book was a work of fiction and the author lets this be known from the beginning. Her research of history was impeccable. Her story of the characters was a fiction--and even if one thought the characters were not believable, who knows. I've met a lot of people in my life that If put down on paper  would not seem believable. Bottom line, I liked this book and the fact it piqued someone's interest to delve into going a step further into history and to learn something more.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Very disappointed in this movie. Storyline was dull, acting mediocre at best.<br />A waste of Tom Cruise' talents.  I was at the very least hoping for good music, but that did not happen either.
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed this series of books. An awesome story line as well as a great read in general. I normally don't pay full price for books but I enjoy reading all kinds of books and this is a series I was glad I paid for and will read again.
B0087DFIOU|4.0|Id say that this movie and Payback are two good examples of Mel playing the Anti-Hero. In Payback he's kind of a dark character who was robbed and betrayed by his partner and wife and its almost funny how he goes about getting revenge on the people who stole everything from him. This movie kinda goes along with that formula, he has to do some crazy things just to survive in this mexican so called \\"jail\\". This is a B movie though because you havent really heard an advertisements for it and i think it went straight to DVD, but its worth a watch.
B005NNV4TU|5.0|Another great Album by Pink Floyd...many good songs & tunes on this Album..worth listening to...as with most Pink Floyd songs..just gets better with age.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought that it was a great book. In almost every page of the book something bad happens to Greg.
B005NNV73S|5.0|One of Pink Floyd's best Albums...Always entertaining ..Never Gets Old One of their Classic Albums. It gets better with age.
B008AT9XOC|3.0|This has long been one of my favorite movie musicals.  I saw in theaters during its original release and have seen it onstage a few times so I was glad to finally see the original ending in full color.  It's still the same story, Seymour still gets the plant, Audrey still grows and demands more blood...<br /><br />BUT... I think we could have used an editor.  Perhaps the producers were so happy to show us the entire ending that they let that go.  The problem though is that the finale feels endless, especially once the main characters meet their fate (and even before that.) The version of \\"Mean Green Mother\\" in the film is edited and with good reason, there's far too much time spent of Seymour staring in horror and the plant unfurling.<br /><br />Another problem is that Seymour and Audrey are so sweet, we grow to like them and they can't just come out onstage after and take bows or sing as part of the plant in the finale.  And the final destruction of the city by the plants is technically well done but how many shots of screaming strangers and exploding walls do we need?  It's overdone.  Sacrificing five minutes of this footage may have been able to keep it light but by the edn, I was exhausted.<br /><br />I'd buy this but keep the theaterical version handy as well.  Depending on your mood, you can choose your own ending.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Great CD, every song is good.I can't wait for more of his music.He is extremely talented and this CD proves it.
B005G02RIC|5.0|I loved it! My only complain is that there aren't enough Bue ray Operas, if there were I would buy them all!
B002UJIY7A|5.0|I think the movie is great, it's a bit strange but definitely worth watching.<br /><br />The movie arrived earlier than the expected date.  It came with no damage on the case or disc and the the movie played great.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|Bought it used, and when i checked it, it looked new!<br />No complaints at all!<br />I highly recommend it to anyone that loves Opera
0340364777|1.0|I'm a huge Stephn King fan (particularly of some his short stories, such as his masterwork, \\"N\\"), but \\"It\\" is his absolute worst.  Why:<br /><br />1.  It's NOT SCARY.  There's a bit of creepiness in the beginning of the opening scene, when six-year-old George describes his fears of the cellar and then nevertheless forces himself to reach into the darkness to flip the switch, but once the NON-SCARY clown shows up and starts chatting with George from inside a sewer drain, the unknown has been made known, concrete and even a bit silly.  What the clown does to kill George is horrific, yes, and comes as a surprise, but it's not SCARY.  There's a difference.  The best horror -- including *King's* best horror -- is not only horrific but scary, better yet terrifying.  That King quotes repeatedly from Shirley Jackson's masterful, unforgettable \\"Haunting of Hill House\\" only highlights how far short \\"It\\" falls of that mark, and comes across as arrogance and ego on King's part, a curious blindness to his own work's gross inferiority.<br /><br />The first leper scene was a bit creepy, but then, come, on!  The Teenage Werewolf?  Frankenstein?  Those hokey, corny, even *campy* monsters from 1950s matinees that scared, if anyone, only the under-nine crowd?  I kept thinking, What next?  Mothra?  Count Chocula?<br /><br />And to top it all off, at the end, it turns out that the fearsome shape-shifting \\"It,\\" in its \\"true\\" form, is just a Big Ol' Spider???  A pregnant spider (you know, like Charlotte in Charlotte's Web) whose prematurely delivered babies can be killed just be stomping on them?  A spider that can be killed by having its heart squeezed between the hero's two hands?  I kept thinking of the spider in Richard Matheson's wonderful \\"The Shrinking Man\\" -- *that* was a spider to contend with.  (And that was a book that not only was decidedly creepy, it also, in marked contrast to King's mess, had something to say about the human condition.)  \\"Pet Sematery\\" was SCARY, in a way that has stayed with me since I was a teenager.  The scene in which the cat jumps off the bed and lands with an ungainly lurch is unforgettable.  \\"It\\" failed utterly in this regard.<br /><br />2.  The group sex scene among 11-year-olds is not only, as many others have pointed out, gratuitous (i.e., you could easily excise it from the book and do nothing to disturb or weaken the plot, themes, pacing and characterizations; in fact, in this case you could *improve* all of them) and based on the fallacious non-logic about children and sex favored by pedophiles (I'll explain that below), but also bathetically, risibly awful, the literary equivalent of an Elvis painting on black velvet.  It's bathetic primarily because it's so *unreal,* so inexplicable in terms of Beverley's character, and those of all the boys, and because it therefore comes across as too convenient; an authorly self-indulgence.  In short, a *sexual fantasy* introduced to serve the author's desires (and that would presumably pander to those of some readers), rather than something reality-based that would logically grow out of the specific characters and the situation in which they found themselves at the time.<br /><br />King could've vastly improved the scene if he had, say, made it clear that Bev was an extremely screwed-up kid who was not only a sexual masochist (even at age 11), but also was defiantly, and in a sick way, fulfilling her father's prurient and insulting assumption that she was having sex with her male friends at a time when their friendships were entirely sex-free; that doing it in the sewer made it all the dirtier and more disgusting for her, because that's how her father had made her feel about herself.  (If, iow, he'd done the basic writer's job of truly entering the character's head and making his or her actions logical in terms of character.)  And if he'd presented it as Bad Sex and a Bad Thing; as an instance of a psychologically abused and confused girl pressuring a bunch of equally confused boys into an uncomfortable-to-traumatic-to-scarring event for boys and girl alike, which they either never discussed again out of shame and mortification, or, more likely, eventually led to one or more of the boys, right after Bev made him angry or jealous, spreading the story all around school to publicly humiliate and shame her.  But, no, King presents the group sex as if it's sweet, beautiful, healthy and even cosmic.  As if Bev was RIGHT that it was necessary for her to have sex with all the boys in order for them to escape from the maze of the sewers after killing the Big Ol' Spider.<br /><br />The scene also fails to be true to the character of the boys.  For example, would sensitive, self-conscious-about-his-fat-body Ben, who has an intense crush on Bev, be willing to have sex with his beloved for the first time *in front of 5 other 11-year-old boys*??  Would he be okay with sharing his beloved with these five others in a gang bang?  In a sewer??  I don't think so, and I think anyone who's ever gone through a childhood crush would agree.<br /><br />As for the pedophile-logic part, while it's true that the scene itself isn't pedophilic, since all the participants are 11-year-olds, it *does* rely on several lies about kids and sex that pedophiles routinely trot out as rationalizations for their crimes.  The lie that it's plausible for an 11-year-old girl to initiate sex, even pressure the boy(s) into it, out of simple, healthy desire.  The lie that an 11-year-old understands the social meaning and nature of sex sufficiently to be capable of informed consent to it.  The lie that it's plausible for an 11-year-old girl to have sex for the first time with six boys, one after another, suffer only a bit of blood loss and soreness, enjoy it and even have an orgasm.  This portrayal has nothing to do with real 11-year-old girls, and everything to do with the fantasy girls dreamed of by pedophiles.  (See A.M. Holmes's deeply flawed but still superior \\"End of Alice\\" for an example of a unreliable pedophile narrator who tries to fob off his fantasy of a sexually voracious 13-year-old girl as real, when in fact she was unwilling, unconscious and his rape and murder victim.)<br /><br />3.  Underlying sexism, racism and heterosexism/hetero-normism.  Isn't it odd how we've got a group of seven kids/adults, one of which is black, one of which is Jewish, and one of which is female, but it ends up that it's three of the white, Christian, macho guys who are supposedly mentally and physically strong enough to face down the Big Spider and kill it?  The Jewish guy is the one who's so mentally fragile that he commits suicide in one of the first scenes.  The black guy is peeled off early by a mere \\"dogsbody\\" of It and sent to the hospital with knife wound.  Another one of the white Christian guys -- but one who's been portrayed throughout as a weak Mama's Boy who's now dominated by his wife -- is unlucky enough to have his arm bitten off by the Spider in a preliminary skirmish and dies.  The female character -- the oh-so-wiling-to-conform-to-the-male-author's-fantasies-and-convenience Bev -- chooses to sit back and cradle the head of the dead Mama's Boy in her lap.  Ben, the fat boy who grew up to be thin, tough, successful and a man with a gargantuan ability to hold his liquor, is given the secondary role of stomping on the Spider's babies.  It's left to the group's leader, Bill, and its successful class-clown-type, Richie -- both straight, white and male -- to confront the monster directly and kill it.<br /><br />The only gay characters are early victims of It -- unless you want to count the two bully Bad Guys who toy with a half-fulfilled exchange of hand jobs before one stomps off in a huff.  And of course, when we have the group sex that's supposed to cosmically deepen the bond of the group, it has to be exclusively heterosexual.  Six guys on the one girl, no guy-on-guy sex at all, as if it's unthinkable, even for cosmic-style sex.<br /><br />4. Literary matters.  *Way* too long and repetitious with indulgent tangents and digressions.  Boring.  The structure -- switching from one of the seven characters to another, sub-chapter by sub-chapter creates a sense of a writer going through the motions, or ticking off the steps in the story as if it were a to-do list.  It makes the work as a whole feel uninspired, like it ain't got that \\"swing.\\"  At the same time the structure is overly complex, switching between third-person narrations and first-person \\"interludes\\" narrated by Mike, the black guy.  The constant shifting between 1958 and 1985 is also overly complex and at times hard to follow -- sometimes I had to flip back and check the heading to see which period we were in.  The device of having the characters \\"forget\\" everything that happened when they faced down It feels too convenient -- a way of saving the climactic scenes for the end.Alice\\" for an example of a unreliable pedophile narrator who tries to fob off his fantasy of a sexually voracious 13-year-old girl as real, when in fact she was unwilling, unconscious and his rape and murder victim.)<br /><br />3.

The book was so good at the beginning that I didn't want it to end but couldn't stop turning the pages!!

014241493X|3.0|Paper towns, written by John Green, is a mysterious book that keeps the reader wanting to know what happens next to Quentin Jacobsen's search to find  Margo Roth Spiegelman. Margo was the most popular of them all. She had a ton of friends and was constantly in the limelight. Quentin or 'Q' was considered a loser in his own mind who was always to the side with his two best friends. Q had always admired Margo and her adventurous stories. One night when Margo climbed into his room late at night to go on an adventure of their own, things started to change. After that long night, the next morning Margo was missing. Although the Spiegelman family think this is one of Margo's little game, Quentin has his own view. It seems as if Margo had left several clues for him to come find her. At this point of the book it feels very slow because you do not know where the clues are taking you. But of course John Green makes it interesting and suspenseful Margo has Q looking almost everywhere for her, but he never gives up.<br /><br />I wasn't very impressed with this book. John Green is one of my favorite authors but I felt as if this book was never ending and very slow. There was some confusion on why this boy would drop everything he is doing to find a girl he has not spoke to in 10 years, but still it puts in that romantic factor. John Green is a great writer and if you are interested in reading a book with alot of suspense and cliff-hangers, then this is the book for you.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|THIS GAME IS ADDICTING - IM UP TO OVER 3,000 COINS - DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER I COLLECT ALL ITEMS, BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO EVERYONE.
B008VZVFQ4|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet - for me this book is worth far more than what it costs - and I would highly recommend it to just about anyone.
B007T8BYWE|4.0|I like this game because often you dont know what the pic is going to be until after the puzzle is done.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Great movie - a mind stretcher! I would recommend this to those who can follow closely as it gets a bit layered. Check it out.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This is a quirky book but once you just let go of reality and enjoy it, its alot of fun.
B00913DPW2|4.0|I enjoy this type of \\"search and find\\" format. It was impossible to finish without using the cheats/hints, but that didn't bother me. Kept me entertained which is all I was looking for.
B00A7PXBPE|5.0|With out question, This is as good as most of the recent Motion-Picture I paid TOP DOLLAR to watch!!! This is what TV should be!  what a great job of writing, filming & acting.  So, FIVE STARS from this viewer and if you think you might, Just MIGHT want to see this...do yourself a favor and give yourself a treat and rent this series.  You will NOT be in RUE of spending the (first) $1.99...If you are regreting spending 2 bucks for this... you have been living under a rock for to long.<br />So, please feel free to refute this review...actually....you can't... it is that GOOD!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I purchased the Fiio device a year ago and wanted to comment on the reviews saying they couldn't hear the difference. That is entirely possible. If you typically listen to compressed pop music or heavy metal then this is not a device for you. But if you listen to classical, jazz, or acoustic music and use a pc to drive small or self-powered speakers you will notice the different.<br /><br />The sound stage presented by this headphone amplifier is remarkable. It is more noticeable when using speakers as the music fills the space and the instrument location becomes 3 dimensional. The screen provides clear status of the adjustments available. The usb and spidf ports are the ones to use. Using the headphone out from your laptop or computer will not yield the best results. I strongly endorse the device and most people I know who enjoy music could hear the difference the E17 made. As with all audio the better the source the more detail a good preamp can present.<br /><br />Cheers!

0385737955|4.0|Dont get me wrong, I love this book. My only problem is with Teresa. I honestly hate her character, and the way she ties into this book. I don't think she fits in at all and right from the beginning, i knew she was bad.<br />(Spoiler Alert)<br />I have to say I am so happy that she dies later in the books. I think the books would have been a lot better with out her. I was super mad when I found out what she did to Thomas. I was an emotional wreck, crying for him!
030759565X|5.0|I've been lurking on the Smitten Kitchen blog for 3 years now and have tried numerous recipes on the website and a few in the new cook book.  Deb has never led me astray; all the recipes have turned out tasty and super yummy! While some of the recipes can take time and more effort, the results are well worth it.  I have bought several copies of the cookbook for christmas presents for my family members.  I think it would make a great gift for anyone who likes to cook good food.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I've been a minimalist for about 10 years when it comes to recording music and have been recording with my instruments connected to my PC mic input with my instrument cable and a 1/8\\" adapter, but it was always a hassle for me to get it sounding professional through mixing and editing. This mixer doesn't have that many frills, but it is exactly what I needed to streamline the recording process. It is powered by USB or the included AC adapter, and even has enough power for phantom powered microphones, which is perfect for my compression mic. The instrument cable and microphone XLR input are in the same place, so you can only use one at a time, but it's great for a one man band with one-by-one multitrack recording methods. There are bass, treble and pan bars for both channels, but I've only ever used the main channel and haven't tried using the line out as of yet. The sound is excellent and crystal clear once you get it completely set up.<br /><br />This mixer is pretty basic, and you won't find a lot of fancy features. But if you're looking to make professional sounding recordings, with some practice and tinkering, this is perfect. Having this, I really have no need for any other recording equipment besides my PC and some mulitrack software. The price is amazing for making the dream of turning my bedroom into a recording studio come true. I'm not sure how this would fare with live performances because you would have to do some rigging to run multiple instruments through it and it might be a hassle, but I think it's perfect for home recording.<br /><br />As a few other reviewers mentioned, you really need to go to the Behringer website and download the drivers for this mixer. It will clear up the hiss and buzz that you hear when you record with it straight out of the box, and it makes all the difference in the world quality wise. I use Audacity with ASIO plugins to record my audio, which requires me to crank up the volume and gain a lot to get the sound to a good level, but after some tinkering, you'll get very clear sound with no audible buzz or hiss, even using a microphone.l, but after some tinkering, you'll get very clear sound with no audible buzz or hiss, even using a microphone.
B009439HEY|4.0|I have to start by saying I'm a huge Hackett fan, and consider him to be one of the finest guitarists alive, particularly because of his amazing versatility (world-class classical technique, plus killer rock chops, plus amazing songwriting and arranging abilities).  SO - why only 4 stars?  It's beacuse I found these remakes to be \\"too\\" perfect -- that is, they are for the most part note-for-note replications of the originals.  This produces a strangely 3-sided effect:  1) it makes you marvel at how GOOD this music inherently is, as music;  2)  it makes you marvel at how he could have accomplished this feat (getting all the tones right, the parts right, the layering/mix right); and  3) It makes you yearn for some kind of \\"new spin\\" -- why go to all this trouble just to so-closely duplicate these performances, when there is so much \\"meat\\" to the music itself, which would have allowed him so much freedom of expression for new arrangements?  This is really a dilemma for me -- on the one hand, Bravo Steve!!  But on the other hand, WHY didn't he take this opportunity to breathe some fresh air into the music?  The attention to detail is astonishing (in \\"Ripples\\" for example, as the song is fading out, there's that memorable syncopated drum toms fill that leads back to the downbeat - a tiny detail, but he remembered to include it).  It's awesome - but, it begs for Steve to have used his amazing virtuosity to make the songs - say - 10% different -- keep the core sound, but add new textures or arranging ideas.<br /><br />The only true criticism I'd make is the last track, \\"Shadow of the Hierophant\\".  Maybe it's just me, but wow is the tempo fast on this one!  If it had been a new/different arrangement, then the faster tempo wouldn't have been a problem, because then \\"the whole thing\\" would have been different.  But the arrangement is identical to the original, yet noticably faster -- this is jarring, and \\"wrong\\"-sounding.  But I'm nitpicking -- the album is great - it just could have been a little greater.  I will say this -- on the day that Steve Hackett is gone, the world will be a hell of a less interesting place.
B008JAFXOQ|5.0|I can't remember the last new film that moved me so deeply, even after repeated viewings.  I first saw the 2 1/2 hour release version and, though I find most movies today to be too long, I had to see the 3 hour version, and I liked it even better.  Every one of Kenneth Lonergan's characters is a three-dimensional living person; there are no cartoons or caricatures.  The acting is impeccable, from Anna Paquin in the lead to the extras on the street.  I hesitate to ascribe classic status to brand new films, but I feel certain that this one will be respected and loved long after I am gone.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Clear, concise story that gives hope and comfort.  Dr. Alexander explains his experience with both medical facts and spirituality.  This was a great read!
0307276902|4.0|A Million Litte Pieces- I realize Mr Frey, that the addict's life IS in a million little pieces but the families lives are also in a million little pieces. This was a book my son was to read when he was in rehab. I decided that I would eventually need to read it also and I did. I also hear that there is a lot of controversy about some of the incidents in the book but as far as I am concerned, the basics- the withdrawal, the feelings of the addict- were quite relevant and was the beginning of helping me to somewhat understand our situation. It's a hard read- any book is when it hits too close to home- but there are times when we need to try to understand to give us a better idea of the whole situation.
B003UESJFQ|5.0|I recommend this movie to any parent that has high school girls at home.  In a true story, it teaches them about<br />integrity, commitment, love and patience.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is the best packaged Blu-ray set I own. I was just mesmerized at the quality and sturdiness of it. I haven't had a chance to watch them yet, and will update when I do. But it really is worth noting just how spectacular the casing on this really is.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|just such a bad movie... don't waste your time watching this.  The acting was bad, the story-line was inane and it tried too hard to be indy and cool, but it just pissed the mark altogether.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Reminding me of a game called qix from the 80s this game follows a tried and true puzzle trope: split up the play area into smaller sections while trapping the whozits on one side.<br /><br />Slide ice makes this tested fomula work by using light music and sounds combined with touch controls that are responsive.  The cartoony graphics are cute and crisp, but nothing groundbreaking.<br /><br />I'd say that this game is worth a dollar or two for certain, but you should grab this one for sure while its a FAOTD.

B007DIQC90|4.0|I received this item in a timely manner. It was without defect and arrived as expected. I am enjoying a little taste of these popular Icelandic musicians. Its nice to have some music from that country that is catchy, though the lyrics have alot of dark undertones and is much less eccentric & experimental than other known Icelandic artists.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|They took Beatles music and made it BETTER!  The story is clever and well done.  Even my husband liked this movie. We watched it a second time soon after. I bought the soundtrack which I listen to while I walk.  Everyone I have spoken with, who has seen it, has enjoyed it.  For some reason it's hard to get folks to watch it though.  No one can remember the title.
0316017930|4.0|In Outliers, Gladwell challenges the traditional explanations of success and how the successful tell their stories. He asserts that there is no such thing as personal explanations of success; he opposes how the successful of our time refers to themselves as self-made men without any mention of the stream of opportunity that came across their ways. To put his points into practice, Gladwell tells stories of successful people like Bill Joe, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, etc. and points out the opportunities these people came across with played a major role in shaping their success.<br /><br />One idea resonates across every chapter in the book; the idea that luck and arbitrary advantages are the main determinants of success in the world we're living in today. He argues that our date of birth, where we grew up, what family we belong to, and the people we meet in our life make a big difference in our path to success - these factors are all out of our control.<br /><br />However, he also argues that it is not always about luck; he acknowledges that hard work does play a role in one's success. He says that no one who wakes up before dawn in the morning and work much harder fails to make his family rich. My favorite quote from the book is: \\"before you can become an expert, someone has to give you the chance to learn how to become an expert\\"; Gladwell mentions this in the book to point out that even the hard workers need to be given the opportunity to unleash their potentials before they can become successful. If you ask yourself this question: what really makes a difference between two equally intelligent people? The answer will read: the number of opportunities they've had in their life. Gladwell concludes that what really determine success are the opportunities that come along one's life and the ability to make use of them.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in sociology, psychology, or just reading in general. By reading this book, you'll become one of thosepeople, like me, whose understanding of success has been changed in a way you cannot even begin to imagine.

B0083B3KOQ|3.0|I'm a bit skeptical when it comes to the apps I purchase, and this app was no different. However, it did function as promised and &quot;immediately&quot; coverted a song I had that I couldn't listen to to a format that my Android tablet understood. I just wish it could have been a stand-alone on-tablet app instead of an upload/download kind of thing.

B0010SKSTO|4.0|I enjoyed the book. Very informative. Only issue is that it can be a tad redundant. I feel the book could have been just the pictures and I would have received 75% of the information. I would, however, defiantly recommend it.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Here is a movie that is hilarious and oddly put together, it takes place with the world waking up to a overun populous of society as Zombies. With the patagonist character giving survival tips on how to make it through Zombieland before a short flashback of how his very own adventure in this new world. Conceptionally it is similar to the humorous antics of \\"Shawn of the Dead\\", but with its unusual chemistry of characters who remain a small knit family, it's less on the horror factor and more on the scream out loud scale. All and all, if you are a coniseur of Zombie films and want a good good laugh; enjoy this movie anytime!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very fun and addictive, a great way to kill time. I would surely recommend this game to any age young and old.

B006LSZECO|3.0|This book kept me wanting more but I wasn't satisfied with the ending. Felt like there was too much left hanging
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham's books always keep you interested from the get go.  It wasn't his best book, in my estimation, but definitely a good read.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|There you go, they finally made a film for the girls, and like most girl flicks,<br />the men are either comic relief or are portrayed as kind of dummies. So yes the<br />animation is gorgeous and the story not too bad, but when they introduced a song<br />in the early beginning , i cringed and made me ready for the rest.
0062014102|3.0|I tend to be skeptical about Grand Theories of Everything, and I do not trust studies that simply lump every anecdote, rumor, legend, or alleged \\"scientific study\\" in one big pile to confirm such a theory.  Well, that's what Talbot's book is.  It's a little depressing to read these reviews and see how uncritical some people are because they want so hard to believe their New Age dogmas.<br /><br />That said, however, the book is worth at least a casual read, because what he discusses is certainly worth thinking about.  And considering he wrote this over twenty years ago, just before his premature death, some of what he hypothesizes seems prescient in light of cosmological and astrophysical discoveries since that time, especially concerning dark matter, dark energy, and the shape, origins, and expansion of the universe.  (Note: I am not by any means an expert in either field, although I have a strong interest and have done some serious reading in both.)  The holographic concept deserves serious consideration, even if it is ultimately untestable.  I also agree with his idea of the connection between science and spirituality--I admire the Dalai Lama's thoughts on that issue--and his holistic approach to scientific exploration.<br /><br />But he goes overboard.  He let his enthusiasm run away with him.  For example, although I tend to agree with mind-body theories of disease, his chapter on cancer--especially what he has to say about snake oil like Krebiozen--is way over the top.  He treats every mystical experience anyone ever had as absolutely valid.  He applies his Grand Theory uncritically to NDE's, dreams, religious visions, psychic phenomena...you name it.  In short, he completely abandons the logical rigor and skepticism that is needed in a serious study that purports to be scientific.  Perhaps had he lived longer, he might have been able to develop his ideas in a more well-organized fashion.<br /><br />So read it.  The first third is worth a careful read for a good introduction to the ideas of David Bohm.  The last two-thirds--give it a good skim, and keep an open mind.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me a lot of the Ugly series by Scott Westerfeld. It is set in a world that is controlled by a centralized government, and they sell the lie that love causes problems. So when children reach a certain age, they undergo surgery that gets rid of their ability to feel love. There is also a group of rebels who oppose the government. It is well-paced and I really enjoyed it.
B009KYXEY6|3.0|The Born To Die disc is suppose to have 15 tracks, but mine only has 12 tracks! Not particularly pumped about this!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie is definitely a continuation of the Alien saga it has all the feel of its predecessors. While it is worth watching you will not find any of the wow that came from the first installments. But the quality is good, the acting is good, and the story is just a little thin but entertaining. The character development could have had more depth and the energy of the show suffers for it but not badly. There just was not the hero to identify with. There was not enough new ideas to titillate your imagination with.<br /><br />When it comes down to it I would rate it a 3.5 out of 5 stars and I am a SCIFI enthusiast. I am always looking for that new concept that just hasn't been coming in this genre of film lately so I may have a tainted view of it. But if you are like me you will take anything that comes along and enjoy it for what it has and that is good effects (while not new) and a little pondering of how we all came to be here.<br /><br />See it and see if you agree with me.
B004YRSBTW|5.0|Memento blows the mind - causes you to question everything you see, everyone who appears in the movie, and causes you to rethink past and present assumptions. I read this in tandem with my college Film Adaptations Course, comparing the writing to the adaptation. In this case one brother disclosed an idea, and both wrote their creations at the same time. Both were coming from a similar place, but not one recreating the other. In this case, the written story made it big due to the excellent movie, not the other way around.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first book was enough to suck me in and by the time I was at its end, I wanted more.  The characters were engaging, quirky, and believable, and truly drive the story.  The setting was intriguing and the entire time I read I kept piling up new questions about it that reminded me of the TV show LOST.  While the depth of those questions were far more encompassing, Wool had just the right amount of them and the structure of the story really pulled everything together while still maintaining a healthy dose of mystery.<br /><br />I won't spoil it here with detail, so support Hugh Howey and BUY THIS BOOK, you will not regret it!  On to book 6!
B003AVPV1O|5.0|This VGA splitter is sturdy and well made; quality heavy duty housings and cable. I had no problems with the signal quality even when only one monitor was hooked up as some have mentioned. It should be noted that I am only using short, high quality VGA cords to hook up both my monitor and television at the same time (longest distance 10 feet) so I can't speak for signal quality at longer distances. The only difficulty I encountered is when rebooting my computer the screen resolution was changed from 1920x1080 to 1024x768 and the picture on the computer monitor was slightly over to the left leaving a small gap on the right side. I don't blame this on the splitter though as it was due to plug'n'play issues with having 2 monitor devices hooked up at the same time and the computer got confused. A quick change of resolution and an adjustment to the horizontal alignment on the computer monitor fixed the problems and they didn't occur again even when rebooted.

B00466HM28|5.0|first off, let me just say that this controller is THE BOMB. it is made of plastic and such, but it is surprisingly sturdy. the Arpeggiator is a nice little touch on top of the ultimate package, 3 octaves of keys, 16 pads and 8 knobs for under $90 is insane. the only problem is the software (it can get a little sticky, but just Google it)and the keys are a little small and light, also the pads aren't very sensitive. but i wouldn't expect much more from a controller in it's price range. Phenomenal little product, great for on-the-go production, definitely the best option out there.
030758836X|5.0|A great read for those who like to be kept guessing until the end.  The audio version was superbly done as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The first few games are a lot of fun.  Then you graduate to the more difficult games.  I found those challenging, yet still fun.  Then I graduated to the really difficult games & I must admit to getting frustrated.  But oh the satisfaction when I finally solve it!!!  Am I sorry I got this one???  Oh NOOOOOOO!!!  I LOVE a challenge!!!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am still reading this book, but it features John Corey, which is the reason I picked this to read.  It is hard to put down, even though  I have very little time to read.  It is  very suspenseful - because you know John & Kate are going to be put in impossible situations in which it seems they are doomed.  But with John Corey's wit and personality, at times, it is still hysterically funny.<br />Nelson DeMille has a way of writing that never gets in a old - as with some authors - it seems each book is the same, just the characters have  different names and in a different setting.
B008COD5OO|5.0|I was shaking when this movie was over.  It was that good.  Absolutely amazing.  Ima live for a night like that.
B002N57KG2|5.0|This is a classic car junkie, zany comedy. It's not very politically correct but that is exactly what I love about it.<br />What's not to like about Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. dressed as priests, drinking martinis while racing a Ferrari accross the country!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was riveted to this story line from the first chapter.  The book kept you mesmerized by the flow of the characters personalities to stay alive in The Hunger Games.  I was very happy to see Ms.Collins give a female the lead character who not only showed compassion and fear but also survival instincts.  And what a survivor she was.  Can't wait to read the next book.  Way to go Suzanne Collins!!!!!!!!
B0099ETLPS|3.0|This 2 DISC DELUXE EDITION. I do not think this edition is for everyone. Serious Blackmoe/Dio collectors would want this, but if money is tight (and it is for most of us) you may want to keep your previous remaster. Casual fans wouldn't need this version. The reason I bought this was for the \\"Rough Mix\\" of  \\"Rainbow Eyes.\\" Without the overdubs it is a very \\"alone\\" and poignant sounding which has extra significance with the passing Of Ronnie James Dio.  The remastering is ok/good, a bit more top- end clarity, but it is no revelation. The extra top -end may bother some, but remember Rainbow were never recorded that well in a technical sense. Martin Birch was awesome but the band often recorded in unconventional places. The very first Rainbow album was recorded better than the several that followed. Although that first album was recorded very dry and was a bit under-produced. The extras here are \\"ok\\" so it's really a matter of do you want the extras and the slightly better mastering? I find it to be an improvement over my Japanese Mini LP version (especially on the drum sound) but the bass, like on many Rainbow albums, lacks clarity and definition. The most noticable differences on the extra mixes are the intro on \\"Lady of the Lake\\", the sparse \\"Rainbow Eyes\\", and the more noticable bass lines on \\"kill the King\\". You are not going to get any substantial or new Blackmore solos on the extras. Where there are new Blackmore solos they are a bit buried in the mix. I cannot believe they included those \\"Don Kirshner\\" tracks!?? I believe those are just Ronnie singing live over a studio backing tracks! (With alot of reverb on the vocals) The liner notes are okay, with a few stories about the haunting of the studio. I am still confused by what exactly happened with Marke Clarke as these notes still do not clarify. Packaging is the same as the previous Rainbow Deluxe Editions. The lyrics are included which is nice too.  Note: I paid less by purchasing this from \\"AMAZON UK\\" and received it sooner as well. For me it is worth $22 but Not $28. At the current price of $17.22 it would be even more worth having. If you were happy with the other Deluxe Editions of Rainbow you should be happy with this one. Those who were not happy won't be happy with this.  I hope the series continues as there may be more bonus material on the later-day Rainbow albums. I'm not blown away by this edition but am glad I have it. For me, \\"Rainbow Eyes\\" was the real gem. **Update. No way to confirm this, but according to an article on the Rainbow fanclan legacy site Blackmore plays bass on the \\"rough mix\\" songs and Tony Carey is on Keys.

0486266885|4.0|The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson may have a long title, but it's a short book to read.<br /><br />The Strange Case is about the duality of man: good versus evil, and how everyone has that inside of them.<br /><br />Mr. Utterson, the lawyer, finds it odd that his good friend Dr. Jekyll has amended his will in order to leave everything to Mr. Hyde.  This is strange because Mr. Hyde is an unappealing man, possibly deformed, not to mention evil, having caused major disturbances and a horrific crime.<br /><br />Dr. Jekyll won't get into his relationship with Mr. Hyde, but Mr. Utterson is going to get down to the bottom of the situation eventually!<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  It was short, and while I kind of knew what the premise was, there were pieces I did not know, which made it a better read.  You should read it if you enjoy classics, a little bit of horror, and short novels!<br /><br />Everyone has good and evil inside of them, and most people work on a balance between the two, shifting more to the good side than the evil side.<br /><br />But what if those two sides could be separated?<br /><br />Would you want to separate your good side and evil side into two separate people?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book

B001CTGQBK|5.0|Still a classic.  Plays as well today as when it was originally released.  Not much to describe since everyone on the planet already knows this flick. Some movies that were great when they came out don't stand up to comparison with more current releases but not the case with this one.
B006ZE66P8|4.0|This book followed the story line quite accurately which I was pleasantly surprised at. I was wondering initially how the book would be able to convey all the details but still move at a moderate pace such that a kid would not be too bored; I was not disappointed with the results. The pictures really added to the emotions of the page that the words didn't have to say and are truly beautiful.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Had not heard of the book before I purchased it. Loved the idea and the way the story was told. Shadow rocks!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I LOVE this series. i will be sad when im finished. anyone who enjoys a little fantasy and great character developement and gripping storyline, you will enjoy this series immensely
034580404X|2.0|I have been told by so many people  the second book is better than the first, and the third is better than the second.  So far I am not impressed and I am 2/3 through the second book.  I would not even continue except for two things: 1) people saying \\"keep going, you will really like it\\" and 2). my aversion to not completing a book once I begin reading.  At this point in the process, I cannot believe my friends have enjoyed reading this series.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|love reading this series, i look forward to the end of the day when I can steal away some time for this book. love the series
B005DESVPO|3.0|I liked a couple of the songs but I wished I had picked up his latest CD, Blak and Blue I believe it is called.
0812984412|1.0|Thought this was going to be a journey into how all things are connected.  I got half way through before I realized this is just joyless nonsense.
1451695187|3.0|Although I was eager to read this, since it was written by one of my former doctors, I found that it jumped from in coma to pre-coma too much. I also found some of the writing to be too technical and more than one chapter was devoted to molecular biology. I did enjoy reading the book just not what I expected.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the way it works on my kindle fire, I haven't had a single problem with the app. It works wonderful!

B0083I90HU|4.0|Sarah's Key follows the story of Julia Jarmond, an American journalist living in France, who is assigned to complete an article on the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup in France as well as the story of Sarah, a young girl, who experienced the roundup first hand.  The novel explores France's role in World War II and shines light on an otherwise scarcely remembered tragedy of the Holocaust.  While most novels about the Holocaust delve into its horrors, Sarah's Key delves into the effects of the Holocaust that are still felt decades later by the French.<br /><br />The novel alternates between Julia's point of view and Sarah's point of view, switching from first person to third person respectively.  Julia's story encompasses some issues and real-life problems that seem truly superficial as compared to the tragedy of Sarah's life.  There is a parallel between the two stories that enhances the reading experience and connects them together.  Julia's story, however, dominates the tail end of the novel, much to my displeasure and leaves Sarah's story left feeling incomplete.  While Julia does eventually piece the story together from her perspective, it loses the impact that it might have had if it had come from Sarah's point of view.<br /><br />Overall, Sarah's Key is a good read, but it does tend toward the female demographic with a \\"mid-wife\\" kind of narrative on Julia's end.  It illuminates a part of history that many are not aware of and provides some insight into the role of the French during the Holocaust.  If you like tear-jerking, emotional stories about the Holocaust, Sarah's Key is definitely for you.
B00540G3G6|5.0|This set came with the 3D disc too! I can't tell you how great a deal this was! I have never seen this one in 3D until now! Wow wow wow! My mind was blown.  This is the perfect movie for 3D viewing... A must for your collection.  Fun for all ages!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|i love this game. i only get mad though on some levels but it is still pretty good! get it, its free!
B007BVOEPI|4.0|My younger brother is a big fan of Game of Thrones and forced me to watch the first episode.  This just didn't seem like my thing, but I gave it a try for his sake... and enjoyed the first episode enough to want to watch another....  and another.... and wound up with the entire season under my belt and was disappointed to find out that season two isn't available yet.  Do not be turned of by renaissance fair subject matter.  This is for anyone who likes a good drama.  Although definitely not family friendly.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|first of all, i love this game! but why is everyone saying it doesnt work for the kindle fire when it does!!!? dont listen to them! its 100% free on kindle or maybe your kindle is messed up but mine works just fine!
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Besides not being able to land on a carrier without crashing over and over again, the game is fantastic. A lot of realism. I find myself using, or should I say, playing this game over and over again. I highly recommend this game. It's \\"Addictive \\".
B009JTCBLE|4.0|Great!  Awesome!  Fantastic!  These guys are really amazing when they get together.  Can not wait for the next album too be released.
B00005M989|3.0|I prefer the two-CD collection &#34;The Hits 1&#34; and &#34;The Hits 2&#34; to this one. They offer a better group of great hits.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|As with all these books I really enjoyed this one also . I tell people this is a Great series of books , in my opinion very enjoyable .
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I had heard so much about this show, I decided to buy the first 2 seasons to get caught up.  What a wonderful surprise.  The acting is superb and the story lines are absorbing and interesting.  Great acting and period detail make this a must see!  I can't wait to get Season 3!
B007U4DIM6|5.0|Enjoyed this movie very much. It is good for all ages. Everyone needs a laugh or two and they will get it from this movie.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|great game, but needs more words. Otherwise I absolutely love this game. That is why I only rated this game four stars instead of five.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Awesome book I was anxious throughout the whole book to see what happened next can't wait for the next amazing book

0312983867|5.0|Stephanie Plum is helping out a neighbor of her parents by trying to locate her grand daughter and great grand daughter. Evelyn's sleezy ex and her signed a child custody bond and now Steven wants his money and the bond was bought for Evelyn by putting up Grandmothers house. Steven is connected to a very bad ass named Eddie Abruzzi and is now threating Stephanie and her family. Stephanie is also trying to capture and take in Andy Bender who is a violent drunk. Bender keeps alluding her and people and \\"things\\" keep getting in her way from finding Evelyn and her daughter Annie. She is faced with creatures in her apartment and car, a crazy, demented \\"rabbit\\" and more cars being destroyed. On top of this, Ranger has decided to \\"call up\\" on his tab with Stephanie. Now with the love triangle of Stephanie, Ranger and Morelli, this could only be suspensful, sexually tense and hilarious. We can't forget Grandma Mazur and Lula to all to the entertainment.<br />I really liked this book. One of my favorites so far. Other than being \\"out loud\\" laughing hysterical as always, it shows a more emotional ,and I felt, serious side to the main characters. Not your constant \\"slapstick\\" comedy. Although I do feel Stephanie is getting a burnt out between all this mayhem and romance conflicts. Would like to see the fiesty, aggresive Stephanice again. Great book. I loved it.
0064431789|5.0|\\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" is without a doubt Maurice Sendak's best piece. Max was vivid and relate-able and the artwork sealed the memory in my childhood head as an all time favorite. My adventurous spirit as a child found refuge in the life of Max and his vivid imagination. I desperately wanted to experience the things Max got to, and because of this desperation I was able to imagine more vividly than before reading the piece. I, to this day, still would love to hang out with the Wild Things and believe the joy I found from being able to read this book as a child has positively impacted my view on the world for good.

B006X415GK|5.0|We have one of each of the characters from Monster High and they are all wonderful. They have many cute details and awsome accessories. I wouldn't recommend them for under the age of 6, though. My daughter started collecting them at 5 and only by the Grace of God did they survive. Many of my friend's who have girls her same age, at that time, have broken off body parts and not been able to put them back together. We, knock on wood, haven't had that problem it the four years since we started collecting. She loves to line then up, change their clothes, and just run around with them.<br />I loved this one so much I got one for myself!
0393334988|1.0|Mr. Lomax seems to be a nice gentleman that suffered through WW2, but torture, not really. From his book, he never spent even one day working on the Burma Railroad. Every time he was moved from camp to camp, it was by truck. He was fed and had medical attention after he was beaten for having a forbidden radio and map.<br /><br />I really found the book not worth reading, unless you want to read about a WW2 radio operator, not a combat soldier, talk about suffering, somewhat, through the war.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|Great movie. I can watch it over and over. Makes me cry everytime I see it. Love to watch it around Christmas, since it is a Christmas movie.
B0063FGG22|5.0|Hitchcock made many excellent movies, but this in my opinion is the best of his work.  Now restored in BluRay, it looks as if in was made this year.  Colors are really beautiful, and grain is gone.  Cary Grant is one my all time favorite, classic movie actors.  They don't have actors like him any more.  He is outstanding in this role as a New York ad man with a serious case of mistaken identity which puts him in a variety of interesting locals ending at the Mount Rushmore Monument. Highly recommended.
B00932A6G4|2.0|This may be ok for teens but it is just another lame space movie, predictable plot, formulaic story. Too much like a Japanese animae.  It is what it is.
B004DM0UII|4.0|It is a great app but the the white background and light colors make it hard.to read in the car.  please change back to black background or darken catagories.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is just fantastic.  It is a page-turner that will have you glued to your seat as you read, wanting to know what happens next.  I am an adult and I loved the book just as much as some 12 and 13 years old kids.  I can see why The Hunger Games has been a hit.  Just superb!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app and I think its cool that you can change the Colorado of the app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! soliloquy cooolll
B005LAII80|4.0|Like a modern day Verhoeven, \\"Dredd\\" is an insanely violent action romp on the surface and a smart, well-written, and darkly funny character study underneath. While the pacing may not be what we're used to, the film is balanced out by a decidedly \\"un-Hollywood\\" feel that makes for a tense and compelling hour and a half. Here's hoping we don't have to wait another 17 years before we venture into Mega City One again.
1451638450|4.0|This book was very fun and enjoyable. I loved seeing the world threw Ivan's eyes. We still get the adventure, romance, politics, and surprises like the previous books in the series; but with some new characters and situations to relish. It was great to get back to the world of Barrayar and Lois McMaster Bujold.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are all alright. the app isn't revolutionary BUT it is a VERY good time consumer. I personal like the game where you use the bows and arrows
B0031RSA24|4.0|Perhaps not as many revelations as might be expected, but a very thorough, clear articulation of the framework of modern arguments against the existence of a deity, written in a lively, entertaining style that is accessible without being patronising.
B009186JYI|5.0|Excellent footage! The restoration work these fellas did to this film is truly amazing. The image is so clear and crispy, and the mono sound is perfect and it totally rocks in a good amp system. This is (in my humble opinion) the best era of the Stones (followed by their early 70s), and the footage of old Ireland is completely amazing: downtown streets, the country side, the people, the kids. I never imagined I would be able to see and hear the 60s Stones that clear! This is a true gift for all the true fans of the lads. I have to admit that it's obvious that Andrew Oldham was an awesome manager, that knew quite well that this footage would be soon mythic. I wish the Beatles could have that foresight (Mr. Epstein?). And in spite of Jagger's and Brian's sardonic ego, it's clear from the first second that the engine behind the Stones is Keith, an impression I've already had since I've heard the Satanic Sessions (available in internet) and saw the Rock'n'roll Circus DVD... He was the boss all the way! I just hope that the Stones have more hidden jewels from those high times. I've already got their TAMI show, Sympathy for the Devil, Rock'n'Roll Circus, Gimme Shelter, Ladies & Gentlemen and Some Girls in Texas.<br /><br />And I'm still waiting for MORE!!!
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|great time waster.  played many times for that reason but now it will not open on my fire.  where did it go?  frustrating third or fourth time thru but now cannot open.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Pros: Great for reading on a 9\\" tablet. Love the black background, white text and ability to change brigtness right on screen. Changing font size is awesome. Love the ability to read one sample chapter.<br />Cons: I cannot use the app to integrate with Library nor use Kindle Lending Library. Wish Amazon permits for prime members like Prime Videos.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I am a Mitch Rapp / Vince Flynn fan. The Last Man has a very believable storyline and plot, particularly the inter-politics between the US and the Afghans; the concept of reintegration, etc... I thought this book built up very well but then the ending came too fast and was a little not believable. I would have liked to see another 50-100 pages to give the ending it deserves.<br /><br />One nit - the characters land in Germany and then go to Switzerland without having to clear customs - wrong - Switzerland is not part of the EU and you do have to clear customs again there...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My calculator I use to pay my bills stopped working so I picked up my kindle and have not gone back.  This is one of the best aps I have.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|This is a great read. It can be read independently of the rest of Abercrombie's work - although I highly encourage you to read all his stuff! Abercrombie again does a good job with character development, plot, and pacing. I found myself really enjoying and caring about Shy. Plus, my all-time favorite character, now known as Lamb, makes a great return, settling the \\"is he alive or dead\\" question. The ending is left open enough that another book could follow, but probably not with all the exact same characters such as Temple and Shy.<br /><br />I will be on the lookout for the next Joe Abercrombie book!!!

B0083SBMBM|5.0|The Avengers has everything you are looking for in an action packed super hero film.  It's surprising that D.C. Comics has never jumped on the idea of a blockbuster film with six of it's best super heroes.  Marvel is way ahead of the game with thier Action Six pack Superhero extravaganza.<br /><br />The storyline is pretty basic:  Bring in The Avengers or the world will end as we now know it.<br /><br />Lots of action and great special effects.  These superheroes have hearts and brains, as well.<br /><br />They offer up a worthy villian, as well.<br /><br />Holy Super Hero Flicks, Batman, Marvel has upped the stakes and audience expectations!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love the game. Always have been a Tetris and Jewels type game fan and this is perfect for me. The app works great with Kindle Fire and I have not experienced any problems whatsoever. It's music isn't irritating and the graphics and colors are beautiful. And the storyline gives me enough time to rest my eyes as well so I can play the game longer.

The relationship between Eva and Gideon continues to develop as they both slowly learn to trust their feelings and in each other.  I love that Eva's best friend is a guy who comes with his own emotional baggage, I hope that Sylvia writes his story in the third book. There's romance, sex and suspense in Ms Days follow up book, I really enjoyed the book, I would recommend this book
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander's testimony of his near death experience confirms there is no death of the soul and the spiritual world is real. From formerly being exclusively a rational scientist, his mind expanded into other worlds. He was utterly transformed by mystical journeys. I heard him speak in person at an IANDS (International Association of Near Death Experiencers) meeting before reading his book, PROOF OF HEAVEN. I was entranced by his presentation and even more so from reading his story, which is remarkable in detail and scope. For those who might be interested in the topic, this book could open up a universe of possibilities. I am thrilled to have the opportunity of seeing him again this Saturday at A.R.E. I've invited several friends to join me. This respected neurosurgeon might change many people's ideas about reality.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I've now read three of Follett's historical novels, Pillars of the Earth, Fall of Giants and WInter of the World. There is a pattern here. All are pretty good page turners, all are historically informative and all leave you wishing for something more. Who am I to criticize, but I feel that the prose is lacking. Many years ago I read Wouk's Winds of War and War and Remembrance and I recall marveling at the quality of the writing within the context of an historical novel with a set of soap opera-ish threads to keep the reader engaged. I guess I wish that Follett brought more of that kind of flare to his work, since he obviously has made such a huge time commitment and emotional investment in developing these complex stories. All that said, I enjoyed the book, will recommend it to others, and will almost certainly read the third book in the series when it is published.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I give it a thumbs up and I will definitely be buying the next book in  the series by Lois Lowry
B001HPP2XW|2.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's (Blake Edwards, 1961)<br /><br />A week after The Dark Knight was released, the film had a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 94%. Some wag, I don't remember who, opined that \\"the other six critics are all from New York City.\\" Breakfast at Tiffany's, Blake Edwards' love song to that same city, has an 88% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and I think it's the opposite--the other twelve are from outside the five boroughs. Don't get me wrong, it's a very pretty thing, and the combination of Truman Capote's wit coming through Blake Edwards' lens, back in the days when Blake Edwards was still doing material that could be considered edgy (i.e., before his directorial career became an endless sequence of family-oriented Pink Panther sequels) produces some nasty laughs indeed. But is that enough to not only carry the movie, but the incredible amount of baggage that's attached itself to the movie during the past half-century?<br /><br />Plot: Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn in the role that defined her career) is a socialite who, as the film opens, gets a new downstairs neighbor, Paul Varjak (How the West Was Won`s George Peppard), a writer-cum-gigolo installed in the place by his sugar mama (The Day the Earth Stood Still`s Patricia Neal), who lives down the hall. The two strike up a friendship that might turn into a romance were it not for Holly's desperate desire to marry up; she's got her sights set on Rusty Trawler (Lilies of the Field`s Stanley Adams), \\"the ninth-richest man in America under the age of fifty\\".<br /><br />...and that's it, really, with an extra subplot or two added in (Paul is a writer with one critically-acclaimed but commercially-unviable book under his belt, Holly has a past she doesn't like to think about, etc.). To modern eyes, the most terrifying piece of the film is Mickey Rooney's cartoonish, stereotypical portrayal of Holly's Japanese upstairs neighbor, Mr. Yunioshi, which is offensive at every turn. Audiences in 1961 probably found it hysterical while shielding the kiddies' eyes from the idea of a young woman living on her own and doing relatively well at it (while Varjak is explicitly a gigolo, Holly's status as a high-class prostitute remains intentionally ambiguous, but in terms of 1961 dollars, did anyone really believe her \\"dates\\" were giving her fifty bucks to go to the powder room? Not unless she was going to the one with the wrong plumbing).<br /><br />It's true that the final scene is a masterpiece of emotional manipulation (but let's be honest here: we're far more concerned about the fate of Cat than we are whether Holly is finally going to let her feelings for Paul break through), but it's far from enough to get through the ponderous, badly-aged first hour and three-quarters of the movie to get to unless you have the same love affair with New York City as did Truman Capote and Blake Edwards. **sterical while shielding the kiddies' eyes from the idea of a young woman living on her own and doing relatively well at it (while Varjak is explicitly a gigolo, Holly's status as a high-class prostitute remains intentionally ambiguous, but in terms of 1961 dollars, did anyone really believe her \\"dates\\" were giving her fifty bucks to go to the powder room?

B0041KVW2K|3.0|My only issue with this set is the quality of the pressings.  The records have flaws that can be seen as well as heard. The box, book and covers are well done. I have a large Beatles record collection and what I think is a respectable audio system, Von Schweikert VR-4 JR MK 3, VPI Classic, Marsh but that's not important. I listened to Golden Slumbers and there was a lot of surface noise and three pops that occurred in the same places each time the cut was played. The audio sounded good but it was hard for me to get past the surface noise. These are not audiophile pressings by any stretch of the imagination.  I think the masters used had the potential to really sound good. I have a copy of Norah Jones Come Away With Me pressed by Quality Record Pressings on the Blue Note label (owned by EMI) and it's just phenomenal, zero surface noise. I have other Beatles pressings that are quiet and the only background noise you hear is the master tape hiss. That experience brings me much closer to the music than these pressings.  I'd still buy this set as I'm a collector but I probably won't listen to it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Always easy to read, keeps you spellbound.  John Grishem writing as a black man inprosson is a wild concept, even for him!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book, it is a message for all generations to be kind, and understanding of those around us who, although physically compromised, are strong and corageous and as with August Pullman, very funny!  I bought my first \\"Wonder\\" for my Kindle and the second order was to give to a grandson who is going into teaching.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|Fruit Ninja is AWESOME! Played it at Dave and Buster's in the midway and as soon as I got in the car to go home I looked for it on Google Play. I played it all the way home on my cell and as soon as I got home I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire!! I &lt;3 this game! It's addicting!

B000GCFY0I|4.0|I'm hooked on the whole dystopian genre.  I wasn't sure about this book but ended up really liking it.  Some of the wording (like littlies) annoyed me at times but I got passed it.  If you're looking for your next dystopian fix after the Hunger Games and Divergent series this is a good way to go.
B000ICXQU6|5.0|My favorite fictional hero is James Bond, and in real life the one is Erin.  Like a detective and secret agent she investigated an extremely villainous assault on people's lives, property and welfare for money, and works not only with authorities but with the people.  Every bit as exciting and suspenseful as any spy movie, the plot went on to a happy ending with which and person or family could identify.<br /><br />I would also recommend her book, \\"Take it from Me,\\" which adds to the film and explains that there are no fairy tale happy endings.  For better or worse life goes on, and she tell us how to make the best of it.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This game is awesome but please be smart and shop around! These prices are absolutely rediculous! Just price check before you purchase or you could end up spending twice the amount!
B005LJKEXS|4.0|I'm using it to extend an Alfa wifi adapter and that seems to work just fine. Note that this is a USB2 ONLY extension cable. You would expect that it would behave as a normal USB2 device and cause a USB3 port to drop back to USB2 mode but NO! It doesn't work on my USB3 ports at all. Also the female connector is a very tight fit for any male connector I tried to plug into it, even the other end of the extension cable. Other than that I have no complaints.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005LJKEXS BlueRigger USB 2.0 A Male to A Female Active Extension / Repeater Cable 10 Meters (32 Feet)]]

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely loved it. For all who believe in love and forgiveness. A good read....I definitely recommend it. I've read all three - great books.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read several books on NDE's which were intriguing, but this author, being a neurosurgeon, took it to another level that I could totally believe in. Best read of this genre in years.
0743496736|4.0|In this book, Picoult describes a young girl's struggles with a tragedy in her high school. She gives in depth descriptions of her emotions, surroundings, and gives a good set up for the story. This book entertaining and keeps the reader enticed until the very end.

B009FBX5M0|3.0|Newman missed it and the producers must have been sleeping.  The film begged for music that would take the audience away and cast them into the world of James Bond. Apparently begging doesn't get it anymore. When I see a new Bond, I literally cross my fingers and hope to hear substantial and well placed variations of Monte Norman.  But it rarely happens.  The last great score was Arnolds \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\", and in fact was included as an isolated soundtrack on the DVD.  George Martin's \\"Live and Let Die\\" was another spine tickler for Bond variations, not including his protégé Paul McCartney's title nausea, (although chic at the time, Martin could have also toned back some of that silly slap bass).  But Skyfall fell flat for the Bond genre.  And incidentally, in the Fleming Novels there was never a home Bond resided at called Skyfall.  Further, after the death of his parents, he went to live with an aunt, not an uncle.  Regardless, developing the feel for 007, the music is the most important part.  Without it, the Bond films would just be routine action movies.  With that said, why don't these composers realize this?<br /><br />There are three points to the Bond musical mystique.  The simple melody, the eternal four note Bond signature progression and of course, the Norman crescendo.  Without these, there is no Bond.  More and more, I find the Bond movies are showcasing them less and less.  In fact, Newman NEVER ONCE included the crescendo in any part of Skyfall.  In Breadcrumbs, it was omitted (seriously, how could it be omitted while playing the Aston Martin sequence which is the banner for the Bond crown jewel, Goldfinger?) and in the closing credits the JB theme didn't introduce it in the gun barrel logo and then fell just short of where it would normally occur during the theme. Times, they are a-changing.  I remember when the gun barrel logo opened the film as the 007 trademark...now it closes it.  What a waste.  Its like the powers to be are doing all thisjust to annoy their long time fans.  That logo is as important to the series as the hammer and stamp was in Dragnet.  Without it, there isn't! And that's a shame,because after waiting two years one wonders why wait two more?
0385343248|5.0|Most Historical fiction is historical fiction simply because it takes place in the past. Reading it doesnt teach you about other cultures, or a different time. Shogun is a book that teaches you a great deal about European history(Did you know that the Netherlands used to be a colony of Spain? I didn't), Japanese history, and Japanese culture. The novel does all this while weaving through an epic tale of political intrigue, and one mans journey to understand a foreign people.<br /><br />The book centers around an English captain, and his travels in Japan after getting shipwrecked there. He gets caught up in a battle for who will rule Japan, and grows to love and care for the Japanese culture, and see his own culture as barbaric in comparison. The personal journey of Blackthorne s slow and gradual, and almost unnoticed until the last pages. The book also follows the politics of succession in Japan after the death of the Shogun. Blackthorne's various captors all are involved, and its quite fascinating. The tale is quite reminiscent of \\"Game of Thrones\\", except with real Japanese history.<br /><br />The book is definitely not light reading. Its an intense tale with a lot of characters, and you can definitely get lost if your not paying attention closely. I would highly reccomend it for anyone.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|lots of promise, that ends with a canned ending that you can kinda see coming. Visually striking, as are most of Mr. Scott's efforts; a feast for the eyes; famine for the mind. Rather do \\" Alien\\"  or \\" Blade runner\\" as these had a little substance along with the visuals. I felt let down
B0065GC0BA|4.0|A beautiful book, very well written, about a short shared journey of two gentle souls... and how they learn and grow together.  I especially liked how the author writes from the perspective of different characters to bring out clearly how each one is experiencing the journey.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't have cable so I buy each episode. Its the only show I watch so it's worth $1.99 an episode over paying $80.00 for cable a month. The walking dead is the best show out there. Every week I can't wait till Sunday.thankful that Amazon has this option for this show.
B000ICXQS8|5.0|I've been meaning to get this dvd for some time and glad I finally had the chance and watched it as soon as it arrived at my home.  This is a classic, bittersweet story about two men finding a special kind of love together in spite of their every day lives. It shed knew light and understanding on some of the relationships I've been blessed by in my past and ones I will cherish my whole life.  I'm sure I'll watch this story again and again.
0345505387|5.0|I ENJOYED THE \\"COMIC BOOK MEDIUM\\"  REMINDED ME A BIT OF THE ILLUSTRATED CLASSICS.  THE STORY STAYED CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL BOOK \\"OUTLANDER\\"...ONLY MISSED THE MARK WITH THE ARTWORK, THOUGH.<br /><br />ALL IN ALL, PRETTY GOOD!
B009AZZEU2|1.0|They should have stayed away for a little longer to write some better music. If you were expecting to rock out to more songs along the lines of 'Live to Rise' then you will be greatly disappointed in this alblum. What a shame!

B0058VW36U|4.0|Fun problem solving game for my 5 year old grandson and the family enjoyed plaing it together. This is a great game for a free game app
0547995660|4.0|I have had the opportunity to read this book in the school for class reading matter. At the beginning it was a little boring but then the story becomes very exciting. It describes a imaginary life where there are rules that are never possible in our world. The part that I like more is when Jonas receives the memories from the Giver. It is a very nice passage where the author describes in what kind of world the people live there. It's a perfect book for adults and also for children.
B007OWRBJK|3.0|I expected a better read than this , considering this guy has written many many great songs in his career.The book flows slowly and is interesting to an extent, but not anything earth shattering told.We fellow musicians read these books to gain insight and learn from our most successful counterparts.I'm only 75% thru this book, but it's very so so and not something I'd read again once I'm done...
B009GEPPYC|5.0|If you like the 80's hair bands AND you like musicals then this movie is a sure thing.  It is 'cotton candy' for your brain.  The extended version has two additional scenes both of which are musical interludes and actually need to be in the film. This is the version to buy.
0743496736|4.0|Nineteen Minutes is a story that draws out deep sympathy for all victims. It begins with the graphic explanation of the school shooting in Sterling High. This shooting is carried out by 17 year old Peter Houghton. A victim to school bullies starting the 1st day of Kindergarten. This story draws you in, revealing the painful effects of tragedy.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was totally hooked from the first page. Dr. Alexander has an amazing story to tell and because of his medical expertise and first hand knowledge, the story is one that everyone should read.<br />I also enjoyed it because I live close to Lynchburg.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Typical Ridley Scott Direction with murderous aliens set in a dark and mysterious environment. That said the acting, action scenes and special effects were good and sometimes great. The story line was interesting and well written but could go a lot deeper into why the aliens wanted to take us out. I gave it 4 stars because it was a good entertainment film plus I'm a big sci-FY fan so my opinions are a bit biased.  Would recommend this for internet download viewing which I did from the Amazon site via my Roku box.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is awesome. but now its November 16 and alllllll the other devices have 0.5.0. except us kindle owners. really amazon? I bought this and I want 0.5.0. but other than that this is a really fun game.
B008458O3S|5.0|I party quite a few puzzle games and this is by far one of the absolute best I've played. The gameplay is unique and the puzzles provided are very well thought out.<br /><br />It takes a bit to get to the meat of the game, as the tutorials can drag on a bit. Additionally the interface is a bit finicky and can be frustrating at times. However, once you get used to the quirks, Trainyard provides an excellent experience. I truly hope more levels are supplied with future updates!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|A simple game, but relaxing. Strategic with out the stress.I like the planning on my next move,and the thrill of knowing it can be done.

B00723NWJE|1.0|I like Norah Jones.  A lot.  This album was crushingly disappointing. Severely over-processed tracks over-ride her really stellar voice.  I couldn't get my teeth into any song except the ninth track and that's because it had a beat.<br />I'm glad I listened to it before buying it.<br />She really doesn't need all the background crud to get a message across. the music got totally in the way.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|In \\"Quiet\\", Susan Cain examines life from the perspective of an introvert living in a world, or at least in a part of the world, that is structured to disproportionately favor the extrovert.  Before you conclude, \\"Well, of course.  That's just nature!\\" Mrs. Cain would have you consider the evidence, and answer a few questions.<br /><br />If extroversion is a dominant and preferable social temperament, then why is it not so in much of Asia?  If introversion is unhealthy and limiting, something to be overcome as we grow up, then why was it not that for Einstein, Gandhi, Newton, or Steve Wozniak?  If you were forced to choose (not that that's advisable or even possible) between the characteristics of `gregarious and popular' or `persistent and solitary' for your child, which would you choose?<br /><br />Reality is that anywhere from a third to a half of the people in western culture are possessed of an introverted temperament.  Half your employees.  Half your colleagues.  Half your students.  Have you considered that the environment in which you gather them for work, interaction, and study might put half of them at a huge creative disadvantage?  If you think that needs changing, and that the desirable change is that everyone should strive a little harder to become `happy, shiny people' because that's the best way to be, think again.  \\"Love\\", she says, \\"is essential; gregariousness is optional.\\"<br /><br />She further addresses and destroys - quietly and thoughtfully - commonly held misconceptions (and myths) about \\"what's wrong with\\" an introverted child or adult.  She offers practical advice - real strategies - for relationships, for raising an introverted child, for overcoming the fear of public interaction, and for arranging your office space to promote creativity among your staff.<br /><br />For those who need to know more about the nuts and bolts, she examines what I believe are vital questions: about brain chemistry and structure, about concepts like \\"high-reactivity\\", \\"self-monitoring\\", \\"free trait theory\\", and \\"optimal levels of arousal\\".  Biology and psychology were never this riveting in college.<br /><br />At the very least, she has leveled a - deliberate and reasoned - blow on behalf of those who would have words like \\"she's too sensitive for her own good\\" or \\"he shouldn't take things so close to heart\\" struck forever from the language.<br /><br />Mrs. Cain, wherever you have been hiding, thanks for speaking up for the quiet half.  We know how hard it can be.<br /><br />\\"The wind howls, but the mountain remains still.\\"vity\\", \\"self-monitoring\\", \\"free trait theory\\", and \\"optimal levels of arousal\\".

B00846REIS|3.0|I definitely think this book is better than what it is usually compared to (50 Shades). While there are incredibly problematic aspects to this romantic coupling, at least the author acknowledges that both these characters have extreme issues that they must work through.

0142406112|5.0|Anthony Horowitz's series of books on Alex Rider are some of the best teen action thrillers of all time. I absolutely love his approach to writing, as He makes you feel like you are watching a movie while reading. I think he does an incredible job of developing the character of Alex Rider throughout the series, and the reader feels a part of his family by the end of the books. This series, bar none, is a must read for any teen looking for a fast pace, action thriller, that will capture their attention for a long time.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|Comfortable reading which was enjoyable. Not so much action but pleasant. A nice book to pass time with. Read and enjoy.
0553386794|5.0|George R.R. Martins Game of Thrones has been by far the most compelling series that I have ever read. It is quite remarkable how he has one, the ability to create a whole universe in his head, and two, the ability to develop a masterful story line within that universe. The way in which he develops the characters are incredible, and really serve to engage the reader in the story, and make them feel a part of the world as well. The Game of Thrones is a must read for any fan of great fiction!
0345529057|5.0|Theres not to much I  can say that hasnt been said already. One of the best series I have ever read. Cant wait for the last two books to be released.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|Although this book is well written, I felt that it was too long and slow reading in many places.  Character John Corey is typically irreverant, cynical, and funny as usual.  The ending came to quickly and appeared to be rushed.  I, for one, was not happy with the unresolved issues at the end of the book.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone doesn't want to spend a fortune on a headset.<br /><br />I bought a pair of these about a year ago for the purpose of having a gaming headset. I wasn't expecting much because they were really cheap. I was surprised by the quality and comfort in this product. The built in microphone is fantastic. No distortion or fuzzy audio.<br /><br />The audio quality in the earphones are what you would expect. It's adequate for your average gamer or programs like skype.<br /><br />The headset itself if pretty comfortable. I can wear it for hours and forget it's even there. Normally my ears would begin to sweat after extended use, but the cloth in earpieces seem to prevent that.<br /><br />The only con is that headset seems to be fairly fragile. I dropped it 2 feet onto my desk and one of the earphones popped off. Luckily I was able to fix it without problems.<br /><br />A quality product that should last a long time. (Just don't drop it.)

B009IU6N5Y|4.0|Fun movie with a pinch of historical flavor! I enjoyed the actor who played Abraham Lincoln. I thought he was well suited for the role.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|All teens and young adults should read this book. The author captures the idea of what life actually is like for someone in highschool who is not a follower or  a leader, and just wants to find a friend to fill the lonleiness. In my opinion this book is comparable to Catcher and the Rye! A must read!
0393080269|5.0|I like this book very much because it gives you a real feeling for what's going on in many different<br />countries: economically, historically, culturally.

B000056HE9|5.0|I have my collection of Christmas movies that I watch every year.  Unfortunately, I had to watch The Bishop's Wife when it was shown on the TCM channel, however, I was thrilled when I was able to purchase it.  Cary Grant is an angel who arrives to help a Bishop (David Niven)realize that his ministry is not about grand schemes or huge cathedrals, but his ministry is about the simple things in life.  Loretta Young is the Bishop's wife and Cary Grant befriends her and through his friendship, she comes to realize that her husband needs to return to his simple way of ministry.  I am a lover of old movies and this one does not disappoint.  It is a really sweet, funny, and dramatic look at people and their faults and their goodness.  The acting is fabulous and seems so uncontrived.  Each of the stars are so perfect for their parts that it is hard to imagine that, at one time, David Niven wanted to play the part of the angel.  I think another reason why this movie is so wonderful is that it harkens back to a different time...when life was less stressful, less complicated.  It sends a message but not in an overt way and when it ended, I just got a good feeling.  I highly recommend adding this to your Christmas movie collection.
