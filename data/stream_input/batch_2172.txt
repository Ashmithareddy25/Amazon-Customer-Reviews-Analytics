0061186422|4.0|The book is a good showcase for Gaiman's work.  If you have already read THE GRAVEYARD BOOK, you'll find the longest story is already familiar to you
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Game was fun at first, but quickly became apparent it doesn't get much attention from the creators...screens are months old, no more coins after playing over 165 days, can't add friends, etc. You need to buy acorns (using real cash) to get more animal families, decorations, etc. (However, these options are updated at least weekly, sometimes daily.) The app didn't let me add more friends, I never got messages from friends, and I never received \\"hearts\\" from other people...even though I visited hundreds of other player's villages. App frequently freezes/locks-up. I have stopped playing. I will remove the app from my Kindle soon.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|.got this game for my daughter but I'm the one who won't stop playing it lol. Very addicting game , liked it very much

140053271X|5.0|Smart, sleek and easy-to-read, this Nook is my first E-reader and I am very happy with it. Easy to use all the controls on it and it features an easy to understand manual so you can access all of the reader's many features. Good price, too.
B00865P3AS|5.0|My wife and I love this CD and highly recommend it to all of our friends and family. It is lively
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What a great story teller Stephen King is! I loved the book, especially the love story within the story. I would recommend this book to anyone needing to escape to fantasy land.
B0063M22QO|5.0|more...more...more! I love this game and it can go with me so many places. Next i plan to start a competition for those 60 and older...we are agile of mind!THANX!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|In my opinion this is the best film of 2012. It would have been an injustice to overlook this film as best picture recipient . Great story , acting and direction. I love this film and highly recommend it. Five stars.
B001C1066E|5.0|The item I recieved was just as it appeared in the advertisement.  My daughter was extremely excited with the coin purse. It was worth the money.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Ohh my gosh I couldn't wait for this to arrive I was so excited for purchasing and you did a great job on getting it to me I loved how it was handled really well.Thanks :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is epic! if you are a mc fan then this is the app for you!I have mc on xbox comp. and on my kindle but its coolest o. kindle/apple! GET THIS APP!!!!!!!
B000095K7A|5.0|Postal Service is phenomenal. I didn't even realize this would include the B-Sides, as well as a poster to boot. Excellent quality, a fantastic album, and the seller was quite quick. Easily worth the price.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|There have been hundreds of young adult supernatural/magical books lately, and their imprint is obvious in this series as well, but it is to the credit of the authors that you won't mind. They take standard material and rework it in surprising and interesting ways. Relationships are complex and change, the world is rich in depth, and the authors excel at slowly revealing this magical world to the reader, so that is blossoms like a flower before your eyes.<br /><br />It is not without its' flaws, however. The plot is good, but several times events just happen without any understanding of them except for characters explaining them to the reader after the fact. Sometimes the explanation is still not enough and the reader is left unsure of what even happened in major plot points, not a good place to be. It comes across as sloppy writing and sometimes is used to just get out of plot holes (a big something happened, not sure what, but we escaped). Also, it gets difficult to get invested in the consequences of events when quite often those consequences are overturned in a paragraph. Still, if you are looking for a fresh breeze in a stale room of supernatural teen writings, this is a good series to read.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|not very fun i hate angry birds anyway but disided to give this a shot its not very hard or good its just there
B008B3MZNI|5.0|excellent in every way. very amazing to all the details in this movie. I was astonished . literally took my breath away
B007TNS6JI|4.0|its a good game quit playing because it takes forever to load anyway good game get it very fun didnt reach my expectations
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Yes I really enjoyed reading this book loved I the twists it kept me well engrossed. I read this book in a week and half
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This was a fascinating yet annoying ,contrary man, who was a genius at recogizing a need and finding the person who could fix it. Disgusting personal habits and morals, and inhuman treatment of others, yet able to find a way when others coulodn't.He certainly was  a 60's product wiith his use of drugs and interest in far out religious groups
B004JHY8A8|5.0|This book had me engrossed from the very beginning. I was reading it every spare minute I had even it was never too far away from me. The description was very good I could picture every scene very well it brought tears to my eyes. A very well written book. I read this book in a week.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I love the music. It is great to play the songs heard on the show again. many songs fron television are lost once the show ends its run.
B0095P29EG|5.0|This movie teaches that a person needs to be humble to be great. Even if you are looking for recognition you should always think of others as better than yourself and think of them before yourself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game, it's fun and good graphics especially for a free one. My kids and husband love it. Great time waster when waiting for a train,The challenges make it more competitive and exciting.
B0045D3N3O|5.0|This is one of the best work of director Spike Lee and the Denzel's amazing performance as Malcolm X. It for sure deserved an Oscar for best picture/best actor which we all know was snubbed.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I am a faithful &#34;NASHVILLE&#34; watcher so I had heard the music on this CD.  It's great to have it in my collection of Country and blue Grass music.  The talents performing here are just wonderful and especially the younger / newer artist.  I liked the CD so well that I have ordered more and given it as gifts, all which were well received and appreciated.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|The characters in this book are not your typical romance novel but are complex and interesting. Even some of the peripheral characters are unusual or quirky. But they are believable!<br />I found the story line to be quite compelling and couldn't put the book down. It is so well researched and the subject matter is so well described it was quite an education. Ultimately a wonderful love story with interesting, if sometimes flawed, characters. Be sure to keep a box of tissues handy.
B000005H3Z|5.0|THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF HIS GREAT RUN AS THE RUN AWAY TRAIN ON A DARK BLUE TRACK GOING TO HEAVEN..
111846446X|3.0|This book is great for basic setup of the Raspberry Pi.<br />It's covers most basic setups, for a beginner user.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|If you haven't read an Archer book now is the time to start. Creative, suspensive, page turner.  I wanted to keep reading,  but didn't want the story to end.
B00AN0KBJC|1.0|No returns, no upgrade option. All I wanted was the HD version but got excited about the price, and hit purchase before noticing that it wasn't an HD version.<br />I'm out $40 and unwilling to shell out another $40 to Amazon to get an upgrade.  I'll spend my money on a disc version from some other vendor.  -1, Amazon.  -1.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I've taken care of horses and this game has all the basics covered. mixing food and treats, grooming and exercise everything a novice needs to learn.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This story held my attention all the way to the end. I have a dog that is my life he too seems human. I loved the way Denny never gave up. Very inspiring. Great story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one of the best apps I've ever played. Way better than the original. Get it and you won't regret it.
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements started me on my journey of remembering who I am. It was a Mother's Day gift in 2006. Keep it where I can easily access it. For those times when I require reminding of who I am.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is such a refreshing step back in time show.  Ever entertaining, our favorite charactrer with her humorous quips, is of course, Maggie Smith!  No matter whom she is interacting with, she gets one up!  Glad the prison scenes are over, that part was dragging on a bit.
B000005AYM|1.0|I am retruning the cd.  Wrong item placed in the case.  I can not rate a product I do not have.
B003L77G06|5.0|I saw a preview for the show and took the chance to just buy the DVD and hope for the best, so worth it! It's so funny and quirky! Happy purchase, DVD in New condition, and can't wait to see.the next season!
1584233494|5.0|The product was purchased at the request of a friend, arrived on time, the product is exactly as described. He liked it and he recommended the product.
B004EPZ084|4.0|Had funny parts, some parts I felt they were trying to hard to look for the humor, ill still rewatch it but i didn't find it side splitting. It's nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a non-Rachel Green-esque roll, even if it is as a crazy &#34;floozy&#34; ;)
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I really like this CD. As with any artists not all of the songs are big winners, but there is enough content of both what we expect from Josh as well as ventures in to new styles for him as well. If you are not sure, you can alsways listen to the samples available on Amazon and decide for yourself. In either case, there will be at least a few of the tunes that will appeal to any fan or new commer to Josh Groban as well.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|For some reason, I'm still trying to grasp the fact that Justin Timberlake is testing out the acting scene. He's not bad, I just think *NSYNC when I see him, Mila is great in everything she does and definitely helps make the movie. It's mostly funny but of course needs the cheesy RomCom ending, but I still liked it :)
0399246665|5.0|Should hold up to wear and tear through several kids. Wipe clean material. Set is small but easy to read.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|Bought this for a Christmas Gift for my daughter.  We watched it once and then decided to watch it again tonight but the movie will no longer play.  We tried everything and we also played other movies to rule out the DVD player.  Its indeed the DVD and its a shame that after owning it for a short while it's garbage.  I will NEVER buy from Amazon again!!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I enjoy playing this game and collecting ponies like pokemon. The only thing is, I'm having difficulties connecting with my sister. Other than that, fun and entertaining game. :)
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I lost all of my previous game...points...coins characters...multipliers...boosters. all of it.  What happened and how can I get it all back???  I am not happy!  Also I have bought double coins twice and I still don't have them!!  I am not happy!!
B0085RZGYU|1.0|I have read some books of David Baldacchi and of all this book is very boring and dragging. It is written as if doing a duty of writing a book of such a big volume without caring to create any interest. It is just a trick to make money using his popularity and fan base. Just nothing else.
0307352153|5.0|If you are an introvert, like me, you will find this book to be a breath of fresh air in the midst of all the stale atmosphere created by a world that just can't stop talking, as the author says. And if you're not an introvert, you will see clearly and maybe understand why we are the way we are. Why I find most disturbing about an extrovert oriented world, is that, we as introverts must comply to extrovert &#34;regulations&#34;, why not the other way around?
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I think this book can make a kids or adults imagination run wild and let the reader not be limited they can have an unlimited imagination. The book's that you have created are letting us have  a adventure side to ourselves, and a big open mind going threw the adventure, I think you have created the best books ever
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|A very good read from start to finish. Lee child out did himself.  Jack teacher and friends were superb. *****
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|its very good for kids. It makes there mind work in some sort of way. But its just that for me when i get older the more it seems to be less entraining
0783233477|5.0|DVD received very quickly and well packaged.  I have had this movie on VHS and haven't been able to watch it in quite a while, I saw the end of it on a tv channel  recently and decided that I just had to buy it on dvd. Couldn't wait to receive it so that I could watch it from the beginning. Great value, great service.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it because its fun to play with friends and its fun to do. It made my reflexs better. Its very fun to play.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Love how you can organize everything (I have 1 camera, 2 big lenses, 3 small ones, filters, books, memory cards, etc) in its own space. I'm kind of OCD when it comes to organizing stuff, so this was just perfect for me. Also, is extremely comfortable to carry.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than the first! I love it! The picture is better, its more changing, and its more fun. That is why it is better than the first!
B005IQZB14|1.0|Stupid is as stupid does, and she sure does alot of stupid. Don't really care about her horny attidudes and how she can't even masturbate because of how she stinks. What crap. Glad I checked it out ofthe library. Saved $12 that would have just gone to her future drug addiction or her kid's therapy. Good chances of both.
B005HSL626|5.0|LOVE IT!! Its very fun and addicting! The only down side is its very addicting but that makes it more fun for me!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I love this show!  I never watched it until it actually came out on DVD and a friend recommended it to me.  I have only made it through 3 seasons so far and heard that it gets quite bizare and sometimes hard to follow in the later seasons, but am looking forward to watching seasons 4, 5 & 6.
B005HSL626|5.0|enjoyed playing this game and the kids really enjoyed getting into the game  had to shut the kindle off to get the kids to eat
0385528752|5.0|I'm a fan of Chip and Dan Heath's books, so I was looking forward to reading Switch.  I found this book to be full of practical advice that I could put into practice immediately in my own situations that need change.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anybody looking for ideas of how to best approach a situation that needs to be changed in their personal/work lives.
0345536886|5.0|It's a Grisham and all Grisham's are good, at least that's my experience! I'm ready for the next one in paperback
B009FOBMBI|4.0|Better than the last CD they produced. Gets old fast though. My two favorite songs are Chalk Outline and The High Road.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Cool. N ow I'm going to type a lot of spaces, cause I don't want to type 20. Thanks to reading. P.S. I was just kidding with the spaces stuff. This book was awesome. It has action, it has humour, and it actually thought me about greek mythology. Once again, thanks for reading, and I was just kidding about the spaces. :)
B0084AZXKK|4.0|This book is great, one of the best classics of all in my opinion and even kids will like it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I wasn't sure what this was going to be... air disaster movie, Denzal vehicle or what.  Turned out to be mostly a story of alcoholism that was done very thoughtfully and realistically.  You just dont know where it will end up.  Fun, suspenseful, makes you think about the gray area of morality.  Cool.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Loved it<br /><br />Great for kids like me<br />It was great stories also read the others they are good too bye.
159514188X|5.0|How I loved this book!!<br />I loved how it was written, and it came in perfect condition.<br />The ending, I really just wanted to flip my lid.  However, I won't spoil.
0316228532|5.0|Never disappointed by JK Rowling! Loving the book so far, but of course nothing can surpass Harry Potter. Thank you!
B004LP601S|5.0|Came in perfect condition, and I have no complaints whatsoever.<br />I love the artist and the song, and there was no damage to the cover/booklet/CD.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Very good book, highly spiritual. Very confusing ending, but worth reading. Great explanation of religion to toss who may have lost faith or do not yet have one.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|This was a good book. Slower than the first 2 . Switch especially back and forth btw characters like a soap opera, which I both liked and disliked. If you read the other two then u do have to read this one too but I will say the ending was one of those non endings. In fact I was shocked that that was it, like the author just got tired of writing got to a stopping point and stopped! Since I an not a fan of non endings I was disappointed.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game rocks!! The weapon selection is amazing, the fight sequences are awesome and the controls are super smooth, dream boat bananas poops.
B0082FPIY8|3.0|I found it a good read and enjoyed reading it. I found it good as she disclosed her past all throughout.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I do not really know what I expected with all the award show Buzz this movie was getting, but I found the book to be very average.  Perhaps it was just the portrayals that were so good.  Anyway, the book was easy to read and the story was interesting, but nothing special, at least for me.
B000FC13E0|4.0|Another Scary story by the master of make believe, with just a shread of possibility.<br />I liked the fast movement of the story and the way I pictured the layout in my mind.  I could all but hear the sound of the swarms and the danger of the characters in the warehouse.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I purchased a similar set of these from Costco (same set, minus the ladle - unfortunately).  I just tried them out today and the basic spoon utensil is awesome.  Comfortable in the hand, easy to hold and it actually did a good job of whisking broth into a roux without any lumps due to the somewhat flattish shape of the spoon.  I'm not sure what the thin spatula can be used for, but the other one is nice because the holes in it will help flip eggs and pancakes.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It works like a charm. It gets me up for school, and tells me when its time for bed. I highly recommend it.
1616550414|5.0|I've been a huge Zelda fan my whole life, and when I heard this was coming overseas I pre-ordered immediately. The book is like an encyclopedia of lore, art, and even some cool tidbits of information the developers have left behind as footnotes. Very big, thick pages in full color, whatever you pay for it is worth it in my opinion. As a Zelda fan, and as a collector, this is a big must have item. I'm halfway through the book and I love it, thanks Nintendo :D
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book gets moving pretty quickly and keeps the reader engaged. So far, it has been a good read. Hope it continues to be this interesting!
B004J4WNL2|2.0|Poorly written and not well researched. Too much pop psychology and not enough science. This topic has so much potential!
B002FE5XVK|3.0|I agree completely with Harry Gaston's review. The video quality looks no better than the DVD version. The sound quality was very good to excellent.<br />The movie is 5 stars but the video quality was poor by blu-ray standards.
B001M3WPY8|5.0|If u love Prince Valiant this movie is a must for you. Great cast, good story good triumphs over evil. Highly reccoment.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can't wait for the next one. This book had many characters return that were previously thought to have been disposed of. Once you think you know what's coming up, a new twist, a different direction.
1439156816|5.0|I'm a writer.  Now that I've read this book, I (hope!) am a better writer.<br /><br />The two most important ideas I gleaned from this book: to be a good writer you have to write.  A lot.  And read a lot.<br /><br />Besides just being a fun read, which all King's books are, the advice on these pages is priceless.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I have given it to many people as gifts. It was a good price, condition was exactly as described and was shipped out immediately.  Great deal and I would order from them again.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|as soon as i got this app i loved it it gives you the real joy of owning a horse works really smooth GET THIS APP
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|such an awesome game. glad I found. it has a great tutorial with guides and hints. plus the picture is great too with special effects
B007PBKG5G|5.0|This music is Ritchie Valenz meets Led Zeppelin.  The complex lines of music between the guitars, piano, and bass really make full and engrossing sound.<br /><br />The music really takes me back to a time when music allowed us to reflect on a time when life and music were simple, fun, and loose.  No sex, no digital applification. Just instruments, voice, hooks, and a rhythm that I just can not get enough of.
B000T433CO|5.0|A friend lent me her copy, and I had to buy one for myself.  A great cast and a fun romantic comedy for the Holidays!  The Hans Zimmer score is beautiful.  What more can one ask?
1892005034|5.0|This book truly changes lives, through offering a way of communicating that is based on love rather than fear. With clear examples throughout, we are gradually shown a way of being that is truly revolutionary based on real presence and respect for ourselves and our fellow humans. The wonderful charts on 'Needs' and 'Feelings' alone are a gift and a reminder of how challenging it can be for many of us to truly know how we are feeling at any given time and what the real needs are behind the feeling. Allowing ourselves to acknowledge our feelings and supporting us to find constructive ways to meet our needs can only enhance all of our relationships leading to a world that is based on mutual respect and love. I am now attending a course on NVC which uses this amazing book. If children were taught these skills in school their lives would be transformed forever.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I have always been an Arnold fan, since his days in Pumping Iron.  Well written story.  Amazing of what this man achieved!
1476704163|3.0|The book was purchased as a birthday gift. I don't particularly think it was well thought out other than another gimmick to make a buck.
B0054R6BFM|2.0|This was a very weak and cunning girl who wanted to get even. She committed suicide because of rumors that began as male conquest locker room bragging which that she allowed to escalate due to her silence. As her final act prior to committing suicide, she made two sets of audio tapes--one set to set the record straight, the other to blackmail the twelve people she discusses on each of the tapes.<br /><br />I didn't find the story intriguing as much as it was creepy. Had this girl's vindictive story been told by one of the other characters on the tape, she would not have been painted as such a pure, lost soul. Unfortunately, many teenagers are finding this story compelling and it is flying off library shelves. They obviously can identify with her plight. I hope they are stronger and more courageous than  this girl.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|I purchased this for a birthday gift, and I remember the movie when it was first released. The cast of characters is top-notch in this rendition of Oliver Twist.
B00383ZTXO|4.0|....far more articulate than the New York Dolls or KISS when it came to the hard-core Glitter Rock scene.  If David Bowie was willing to work with this man, he's worth a listen!!!!!!!!!!!!  Try it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Wasn't familiar with this story, possibly overshadowed by Columbine less than 2 weeks later, so I was surprised at some parts
B0025KVLVA|5.0|.....RnR messiahs are the true &#34;annointed ones&#34;!!!!!!  For me they will always be special; they saved my life and sanity from my drunken/abusive father.  Listen-Love & Live!!!!!!!!!
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Just make sure you have a lot of bottles to practice on or waste.  you will eventually get the hang of it, doesn't cut through labels that well.  I need 30 bottles for a display and went through almost 50.
B000001FMX|5.0|.....the hard rock phase with these guys.  The pre-expected hype was a major let-down when they materialized.  It is a great novelty album to be the pre-lude for KISS!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|All it really requires to enjoy this movie, is that you not be brain dead. Great story, great music, stunning visuals, great acting. I will say though, you might have to watch it more than once, because it's deeper than it appears, and if you're not paying attention, you won't get it. If you still don't like the move after a second viewing, watch it a third time, and have someone explain it to you.<br /><br />For all the one and two star people, I suggest you go here>[...]&lt; and read this review. Also note the name of the site while your there.
B0018BB20W|5.0|.....Of Fame album, What began as a stereo promotion scheme, became a total classic album which helped define the classic-progressive music scene in the 60's.  Passing this album by would be a true sin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|This doesn't work. Not worth the money! It goes together easily but doesn't do much of anything. I wouldn't bother wasting your time or money.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|The whole family has enjoyed the New Girl first season DVD. Several family members missed the pilot show and several early episodes, so it was nice to see how the show began. This program is hilarious. And one of the best parts is, NO COMMERCIALS!
B0067R0APK|5.0|I was at work during break,  when a tornado developed and this app saved my life. if not for this app I would not be here today!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Perfectly compact for the amount of power and the features it provides.  Fully recharges my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 from under 10% to 100% twice and still has enough power to charge it to at least 60% a third time..
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It is a little difficult for me to use, but I am still learning, I will figure it out one day.
0767802470|5.0|Purchased this Director's cut for two reasons.  One, that the dubbing has been redone.  Two, the extra content.<br /><br />I had viewed this movie years ago with subtitles.  With my vision problems sub titles are totally useless.  I enjoyed this movie before and really like it now.<br /><br />To me the dubbing is so well done that I rarely catch the fact that this movie was originally only in German.<br /><br />I have watched half of the movie so far.  It is very lengthy.<br /><br />I convert all of my dvd purchases over to Mac compatible version using HandBrake.  Then I either keep the disks or pass them on to family and friends.
B00993G41S|5.0|Jamie Lee Curtis outdid herself in this one. I consider it to be her best work. It kept me chuckling from the first scene on.<br />This is one movie I could do a repeat watch of whenever I need a laugh or a spirit lift. A must see comedy.
B00457WZEI|5.0|It really made me think about what would happen if this was truly a real story and all of that really happened
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I love this series. It offers so much more than other series we have watched. It's so rich and multi-dimensional. We love experiencing history through another perspective. The characters are well developed and the acting is great. The costumes are amazing. Love the humor woven through it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game reminds me of all the times I went to a carnival and played this game.  Only I win more here.<br />Everyone should play this free game. Children and adults both.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I watched the movie last night and I enjoyed it. It was a great love story and it is now my favorite. You won't regret it especially if you are a hopeless romantic.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Quite well written.  Held my interest.  Became a page turner.  It taught me a lot about computer history and business.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its totally awesome love it love it love itlove it so cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool great game!!!!!!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Another wonderful season of Downton Abbey.  Wow - What a twist in the final episode. I've seen them all and each season just gets better!
B005HSL626|1.0|was never downloaded on device. Hate when promised something and does not come through. Glad it was free or I would really be have a meltdown
B00007M5CO|4.0|I don't like this one as much as some others from Tango Club, but it is still good.  I enjoy the sounds of modern tango music - it grabs me by my core and makes me want to move elegantly no matter what I'm doing when I'm listening to it.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|A popcorn flick through and through.  If you are expecting believablity don't watch this movie.  Unlike inception/matrix the writers herd just don't care that it does not make sense.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play it everyday and have so much fun.. graphics are good and if I speller anything wrong... don't judge.. I'm stupid ;) peace out homeslices
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I'm obsessed. LOL Just love this show. I've watched it at least 9-10 times all the way through including the movie that follows, Serenity. I got the comic books, I bought a browncoat off ebay, I have a replica of Mal's gun... Just saying. I think you either don't like this type of show or you fall in love and become one of those weirdos that goes to a convention so you can hang out with other weirdos who get your obsession. If you love this show/movie also check out Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Doll House (both TV series) and Cabin in the Woods (movie) and Dr. Horrible's Sing Alone Blog (kind of a short movie). Firefly has lots of action, lovable characters, great dialog. &#60;3
B00973902K|5.0|so easy to buy the music you want. Down load to my cloud and i never lose my musice if I have a crash.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have not seen the movie but the book is written with a very accurate interpertation of characters with mental illness. Gives us a little window of the pain , love and hope out there for people with mental illness. Everyone should read, an enlightening book
B009GED3HS|5.0|I have wached the entire series. I started watching season 1 about 8 months ago and have caught up to the present season. Very funny show.
B001NLL93W|4.0|different take on a genre that has few good books out, I enjoyed series was well written and good character developement. got a little twilighty at times but still worth the read
1451695195|3.0|I was expecting more of this book since it has been raved about. The story was mostly about the things he experienced during coma, as well as what his family felt at this time. It didn't provide any proof for me, even though he has a couple of good points at the end of the book.
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|Great CD. If you are a Sabbath fan or just a fan of 80's rock, this is a must have and well worth the money.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Love this game.  It is fun to play and very addictive once you get past the easy levels.  I normally dont play games on my phone...but this one is fun.
1451678193|5.0|Nas Crônicas Marcianas, Ray Bradbury imagina um lugar cheio de esperanças e sonhos, com pilares de cristal e mares fossilizados – onde uma fina camada de poeira cobre as cidades vazias de uma civilização devastada.<br />Os terr&aacute;queos conquistaram Marte e por ele foram conquistados, enganados por perigosas mentiras de uma raça nativa misteriosa, de human&oacute;ides telepatas.<br />Nesta ficção cient&iacute;fica cl&aacute;ssica, Bradbury espõe nossas ambições, fraquezas e ignorância, quanto a um mundo estranho e encantador, ao qual o homem não pertence.  Uma cr&iacute;tica ingênua e l&iacute;rica, aos ancestrais comportamentos destrutivos do Homem.<br />Escrito em 1940, as est&oacute;rias da colonização de Marte possuem uma atmosfera nost&aacute;lgica do passado terreno.<br />Mas esse passado confort&aacute;vel se prova perigoso para os personagens – tanto para os marcianos de olhos dourados, quanto para os humanos.  Os marcianos guardam seus mist&eacute;rios muito bem, mas são dizimados pelas doenças qu chegam com os foguetes da Terra.<br />Fugitivos de uma iminente guerra nuclear na Terra, v&aacute;rias expedições deixam a Terra para investigar Marte, sem nenhum respeito pela cultura que irão encontrar.<br />O livro &eacute; composto de cap&iacute;tulos – cada um deles, um conto diferente, versando sobre a colonização de Marte – e em ordem cronol&oacute;gica dos fatos.  Na &eacute;poca, o mecado liter&aacute;rio dava preferênia a romances – e ele tinha v&aacute;rios contos escritos – foi s&oacute; um trabalho de alinhavar cada um – e vender aos editores no dia seguinte.<br />O livro cobre fatos e aventuras de 1999 a 2016.<br />As complicações das 4 primeiras expedições, surgem com o inesperado e intrigante relacionamento entre terr&aacute;queos e marcianos telep&aacute;ticos.<br />Na verdade – nada de diferente do que aconteceu na conquista do oeste norte-americano e o genoc&iacute;dio de seus ind&iacute;genas.<br />No fim do livro, h&aacute; uma seq&uuml;ência deliciosa de est&oacute;rias sobre o significado da solidão.<br />Em “The silent towns”, o &uacute;ltimo homem em Marte ouve um telefone tocar e acaba num engraçado encontro &agrave;s escuras, com a &uacute;ltima mulher.<br />Uma outra est&oacute;ria considera a perda de uma fam&iacute;lia inteira e a forma que o pai encontrou para lidar com essa trag&eacute;dia.<br />A coletânea termina com a esperança da renovação, (The million-year pic-nic), quando uma fam&iacute;lia de novos colonizadores, desiste da Terra, por um futuro melhor, em Marte.  E temos a resposta &agrave; pergunta inicial do livro? “Quem são os marcianos?”<br />Atrav&eacute;s de contos de ficção, o livro comenta racismo etnocentrismo, escravidão, casamenteo, etc.<br />As crônicas marcianas mostra como os humanos arrogantes e desrespeitosos podem arruinar um planeta lindo e pac&iacute;fico, com sua ignorância.<br />Mostra, tamb&eacute;m, situações como as outras raças existentes no universo podem reagir a n&oacute;s.imo homem em Marte ouve um telefone tocar e acaba num engraçado encontro às escuras, com a última mulher.<br />Uma outra estória considera a perda de uma família inteira e a forma que o pai encontrou para lidar com essa tragédia.<br />A coletânea termina com a esperança da renovação, (The million-year pic-nic), quando uma família de novos colonizadores, desiste da Terra, por um futuro melhor, em Marte.  E temos a resposta à pergunta inicial do livro? “Quem são os marcianos?”<br />Através de contos de ficção, o livro comenta racismo etnocentrismo, escravidão, casamenteo, etc.<br />As crônicas marcianas mostra como os humanos arrogantes e desrespeitosos podem arruinar um planeta lindo e pacífico, com sua ignorância.<br />Mostra, também, situações como as outras raças existentes no universo podem reagir a nós.
B0083D9MXM|5.0|I initially bought this for the transciptions recording(never before available on cd). Every disc is a winner-all for about $3 a cd!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this story!!!!!!  I can't wait to see the movie and share that wit h my husband. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft. It has great graphics and is really fun. The only thing is you can't change your skin, so you're stuck as Steve, but other than that, this game is AWESOME!!! The Nether isn't available either, but who cares? It's a good overall game and I'm glad I got it.
0425263908|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, now I'm on the next one in the series. I cant wait until the third one is released!!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|When I first heard about Sherlock Holmes in New York City and Watson being cast by Lucy Liu, I was almost sure this would suck.  I was wrong.  Elementary has turned out to be a great show that is fun to watch.
0425263916|5.0|I couldn't get enough!!! I can't wait until the next book comes out in May...I recommend this book to every one who loved thirty shades of grey!!!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I definitely don't love this show.  I'm hooked though.  The show is progressing so slow.  I just wish they would ratchet up the action and/or drama.  This season has taken quite a while to get rolling.  Lately, I've found it difficult to stay awake.  But dammit, I'm still compelled to watch.
B003M70O5O|5.0|This is the best tv series I have seen since Deadwood! Awesome characters and plot! You gotta watch it from the beginning to really appreciate this show.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft pe is very cool I'm 7 and I love it<br />in creative mode has all the blocks in survival mode<br />there are mobs and you have lives if if only it was like<br />the Pc game it was toatly worth 6.99
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Overall, this is a great game.  It's very addicting.  It's so easy to say, &quot;Just one more level,&quot; and still be playing 45 minutes and 20 levels later!<br /><br />There are a couple unfortunate annoyances that lead me to dock a star.  First, the online leaderboard should be optional.  I don't personally mind it, but simply on principle, any online stuff like that should be opt-in, or at least have an option to opt-out.<br /><br />Second, if you turn off the sound effects, the game insists on replacing it with vibration.  I'd like the option to play without either, please.<br /><br />Third, the game insists on making you tap through multiple tutorial screens every time you start the game.  I've played this game over a hundred times; I know how it works!  Please give an option to disable!<br /><br />Don't let my criticisms deter you! I really do enjoy this game a lot!  Right now, it's a 4-star game.  Fix these issues and it's a 5-star.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Product was as described and maybe even better. Received item fast and great packing. Would buy again and recommend to others.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Not much to say, it makes pleasant noises. The ui is impeccable, though. Everything works smoothly and as you expect.
B00000IZOR|5.0|Product was as described and maybe even better. Received item fast and great packing. Would buy again and recommend to others.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I would definitely buy this CD again.  Love every song on it.<br />I listen to it all of the time.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Product was as described and maybe even better. Received item fast and great packing. Would buy again and recommend to others.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|This is one of my favorite reads now. I could not put it down. I felt like I was taken on a journey, and loved that it was told from first person view. I also loved that it was true. There may be people who cannot believe a miracle like this can happen, but the story is so magical and hopeful that one cannot help but believe in it. I loved the occasional illustration that complimented this book. They were not necessary due to the imagery that the story tells so well, but I still loved the pictures. I cannot fathom what a journey this would feel like beyond the words of this book, just that I would recommend it to anybody else looking for a miraculous journey to fill the heart with so much hope in life.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A awesome book best one I ha e ever read it was slow a the beginning but it makes up for it
B003B96AOW|4.0|When I was opening this one it was a nice experience, but leter on it was not so good.<br /><br />The main problem with this one is... a Deadpool figure should have better articulation. Shoulders are not good enough, anddn'tget me started about legs. Stiff, no sitting option, he can just stand (like on the picture.<br /><br />But, let's get to the good part, painting.<br /><br />Painting is made very well just like a sculpting, you can see every muscle at arm and six-pack on belly.<br />Head is a mistery, I do not know why, but I just love it.<br /><br />And now forthe best part, accesories.<br /><br />Theese are perfect, something like M16 rifle, detailed and well made.<br />2 katana swords, which can be attached on the back<br />2 sai, as before very good (with the exception they cannot be attached anywhere)<br />2 pistols, remarcable, awesome, flawles, well made, detailed, probablythe best accesory.<br />Also the wall stand, looks bad ass.<br /><br />So after all the figureis made for the guys who want only to display something on the shelf without paying 500$.<br /><br />As for me it is a good figure, but not so good toy (actually the children do not need deadpool action figure, probably)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose this rating because of the new young page ripping way Susan Collins wrote this book. I also love the content of this book.
B001XUJMZK|4.0|This was a good movie - had heart. I think the torture scene was well done.  Not showing to much cruelty yet the viewer gets the point.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Great fun. Brings me back to my teenage years. Still trying to master it though. if only I didn't have to go to work!!!
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|This movie was entertaining.  The &#34;Conan&#34; bar was set fairly high by Arnold and though I like Jason Momoa. I think he was better in Stargate Atlantis.  If you like adventure, sword play and revenge This film will entertain you but it's not Oscar material
B008C1O8CA|5.0|I pretty much loved every track on this cd.  Nothing too surprising, just the great sound and lyrics I've come to expect as a long-time fan.  Keep rockin, GD!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Best book I've read in a long time. Liked the suspense and drama. It's a must read!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This was fun to play,but too many of the same games within the story. Dark Arcana is still my favorite.
0743517822|5.0|Very enlighting book. Teaches us that our action and life styles are the major guideposts to the generations to follow.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|It's not terrible, but not great either. I guessed who was committing the murders approximately 5 minutes in and figured out why as soon as he discovered the drawings. The pacing was too slow and, as others have mentioned, the characters spent an inexplicable amount of time in near-darkness. I found myself checking my email midway through, which is never a good sign.
B005EIS5IW|4.0|Pretty good  g.  B.  :/ s s s s s s s  chugging g g g g g g g
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A book for the ages!<br />May we all rejoice in our time here on earth.<br />Mitch Albom delivered a message no one should miss.<br />Amen
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game just might be the best game for the kindle. If you have whiteboy swagger then definitely get this game. Woop woop
B0063GORYU|5.0|I usually play this on my regular computer at least once every night, but on the kindle it is even better because you can just touch and it usually goes to the right place instead of having to drag. Helps to keep the mind sharp
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|What was on previous dvd's-extras are ported over, but nothing much after first film, nothing new.  Great to finally own all 4 on BD.  Pkging a bit cheap.  Though watching film 4 in theaters wasn't as good as previous 3, time had made me love it as much and enjoy it equally!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is he hens did sk d d d d d d d d d d d d d dd d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d. D d d d. Dd. D d d
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is probably the BEST of the entire Bond series.  It is exciting and beautifully shot.  While people were skeptical of Daniel Craig when he was first announced as the new Bond he has made the role his own.  He's much closer to what Ian Fleming wrote than any of the others.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|We throughly enjoyed this movie.  It was one that was suggested that we watch prior to seeing the Advengers.  I was glad that we watched it, as it did provide information that was helpful in  making the advengers a more enjoyable movie.
4898153194|4.0|This is a great gift for cat lovers.<br />Printing quality is awesome but the book could be a little bit bigger.<br />All the pictures in the book are also on their Facebook page.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I downloaded it, thinking I could watch movies away from wifi. I was wrong. Even. WITH wifi it sucked. DO NOT GET IT.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game love the real feel of the game. I even got my niece hooked on it. cant wait to play again
B00A77II0U|5.0|A great game! I really loved the storyline, art concepts, and the extra content. It was a very enjoyable game.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I started out playing the free version on my Kindle Fire and it was really fun so I upgraded and bought the full version. I can't play the full version because it force closes all the time! Sometimes I can play and make a few combinations and other times it closes as soon as I open it. It is really frustrating as I do enjoy playing the game. If this issue gets fixed, I would definitely give it five stars.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This thing broke in one week, how do I get my money back? The door that opens to be able to charge it snapped off!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie while on a bus trip.  It was very good and showed what a woman can do if she works at it diligently.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Excellent book!.  I was pleasantly surprised at the level of this book after having comparing her to the Harry Potter seried.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I found this movie to be very funny.  At times it seemed to move quite slowly with not much action.
B0084UWDH6|5.0|Explained a very complicated swindling of the folks. Who is to blame, and why. Unmasks the perpetrators from the beginning.
1416914307|5.0|Book came fast, it's such a good series, well worth the read and i intend to order the next book in the series as well
B00846F1YW|5.0|Mysteryville 2 is perfect on the Kindle 8.9 tablet. I did not find any bugs and the game flowed smoothly. I enjoyed the game and will try another Nevosoft game
0634060384|5.0|The Real Book: Sixth Edition is an excellent resource for both new and veteran jazz musicians alike, and has enough tunes to keep anyone busy for quite awhile!  Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and for the price payed, I cannot think of a better alternative to it.
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|There is WAY too much back and forth in this game.  Sometimes figuring out where to go and how to get there is necessary and adds to the challenge but when it becomes the norm of a game, it is just annoying.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Following the Games through the eyes of Katniss is a great way to tell more than one story. She seems to be able to be steady and erratic, cold and compassionate, all at the same time.
B0063M22QO|2.0|This game was very simplistic.  I did not note that there was a description to that effect.  It would have been helpful to realize how elementary this game was.
B00992CF6W|4.0|you know I love it and its in progress but there's problems with saving I HAD DIAMONDS and the world just messed up
0757302661|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, and it helped empower me to have the birth experience that I have always wanted. The birthing positions, breathing techniques and affirmations really helped me through the tough 23 hour labor I had. it didnt make the pain go away, it just taught me how to manage the contractions, and to breathe through them.
B009PJ1S5S|4.0|Can't imagine this film with another actor. I never heard of him before but he was very good. What could have been a run of the mill film, THure L brought it to another level.  Anyone who knows someone with addiction knows the roller coaster it can be and he was very believable. Also, I thought the chemistry was good between the two leads. It can ruin a film when that isnt happening. I did feel that the movie didn't  spend enough time in developing Paul's character though. and a minor nitpick was a particular music was over used. 4.5 stars for Lindhardt acting otherwise would have given it 3.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I bought this to primarily convert some records onto the computer. and It works great at that. The software with it could be easier to use, but I figured it out and it does what it is supposed to do. Since buying this, our old turntable broke, so we use this one daily to listen to records.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed the plot and simplicity of the characters. There was an element of Ayn Rand without the histrionic flair.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen a few versions of this movie but I must say that I love this version much better. I can see this movie over and over again .
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I read a lot of negative reviews and was expecting an aimless book of recipes. The author has evolved. Good or bad he is not the same scribe who penned the first book. I enjoyed reading book 5.  His hallmarks of character development, murder and deviant cruelty are in place. If you want the dynamics of book 3 read said book. Book 5 leaves the reader hoping for book 6.
B00005JOA0|5.0|First time I saw this movie I loved it This is about a wife that was still able to be a wife untill the end of husband life even though he was not the best of men. This is a value that is not easily found any more.
B004V5QWU2|2.0|I had this app on my kindle fire, and it was amazing. It worked like magic helping me sleep. Now I have it on my kindle fire hd and can't stand it. The sounds skip at the beginning of each loop. it's extremely distracting. I hope they patch that soon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it, a real page turner.  The book held my attention from the beginning.  I would certainly recommend this book.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Once again, J.K.Rowling has shown her literary prowess with this novel. The ups and downs are exhilarating! I'd read it over and over again.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I'm not going to go into details on the storyline itself in this review, but I will stress that you really should see the first season of Game of Thrones or read the books before you start on this one. This series is very serialized, with one episode containing vital information for the next one. This isn't a show you can just start on any random episode with. That said, the story is wonderfully detailed with a completely engrossing world and is definitely worth your time to get into. This season ups the action with a few episodes and deepens certain character relations even better than the books do. This DVD set is worth picking up for the story alone.<br /><br />The DVD set itself is also a fine part of any fan's collection. This season set is similar to the first season set, where there is a slipcover with a nice raised picture on the front with the show's title. The DVDs themselves are protected by a sturdy box with the title and the sigils of the main houses of Westeros printed on one side. The Iron Throne is printed on the other. Inside the box, the insert unfolds into six panels with pictures of major characters on the outside. There is also a pocket with the standard HBO ads, coupons for their store, and sweepstakes entry. Most importantly, they decided to tuck in an episode guide that folds out to a serviceable map of Westeros and Essos. The writing is a little small and difficult to read, but it's come in handy for me when I'm trying to explain the world to someone who hasn't read the books.<br /><br />The special features are high quality as well. Readers and show-watchers alike will appreciate the character profiles. Most of interest to me were the 12 audio commentary tracks, each with enlightening and entertaining features. Last year we found out about the George W. Bush head used as a prop in one of these commentaries. I look forward to finding out what details people get interested in from this set. I mainly loved the young actors beatboxing over thetheme song.<br /><br />The bottom line? Buy this DVD set. You get a good deal from Amazon and a really excellent show to add to your collection.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game, really tests your critical thinking skills. Simple intuitive controls. Great value from the low price. Overall two thumbs up from me.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|General idea of this book sounds sad but really it amazing its a regular middle school stories with a little extra great for my age 11 but my mom loved it too!  Really really really g
B005EWDA9M|5.0|I absolutely loved this novel.  It really hooked me in and I loved the the authors ideas and imagination.  It was the first Murakami book I have read and I'll definitely be reading more in the future.  We read this as part of a bookclub and it created a great discussion.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is a fun addicting game. Helps pass the time<br />I cant stop playing. Don't start before its too late
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire I had received for christmas.  It worked great for someone like me that writes short stories, long letters and outlines things I'm involved in on paper.  Much easier than lugging around a notepad all the time.  Sadly, my Kindle broke after a couple weeks and I decided once burned.....  I will say however that there are Kindles that are just fine, I simply wasn't one of the people that got one.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Nuggets of wisdom on every page. As a business leader myself, I found Derek Sivers' book to be a great inspiration for how to approach the products and personnel  that I am in charge of supervising.
140053271X|5.0|This is my first e-reader and I love it. The e ink is very easy on the eyes. A backlight would be nice.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and decided to purchase it for myself. It's funny and I love celtic things so it was easy to see we needed this for our collection too.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A great survival novel in a novel place.  The main character is very inventive and expresses himself with a sense of humor.  I really enjoyed this book.  I say this is a great sc-fi adventure.
1449415881|5.0|I have had these daily calendar things on my desk for about 8 or 10 years and each day I get a good laugh.  Most of the issues shown on the sheets I have seen in my work.  That makes it all the better because I know the folks that do those stupid things.
B008645YH6|5.0|Discovered Marina on Soundcloud and fell in love with her music.  I know she's not quite a 'American thing' yet.  Yet!  She will be and glad to say I was ahead of the rest in discovering her talent and electric attraction!
B008VBYN80|3.0|It's not a bad game. I've be waiting for a civilization style to come out for the fire for awhile now.  I am disappointed however that it's one of those crappy zynga style games where you have to wait for energy or throw away money if you just want to play.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|We really enjoyed the music in this movie and even the plot is cute.  Some of the joke writing is clever.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I read the reviews and ordered this based on the favaorable comments. When I opened the box and saw how small it was, I thought, \\"really\\"?  Well this little hummer delivers. I am impressed with the EQ settings, volume control and overall performance.  It truly does exactly what it is advertised to do.  Great boost in volume and good selection of equalizer settings.  I use it with my TV which has a fixed AV outlet only so no sound adjustment. The little amp is just what I needed to enjoy great sound.  Anyone can get a defective unit, but if working properly this product delivers exactly what's promised-great sound!
B006XF5BTG|4.0|If you're pretty well read on the body building basics this books pretty revisits all of them. I do like his take on the supplement companies and magazines. The actual lifting plan is ok and i cant say i disagree with it. If you're new, it's a great read.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Arrived quickly and in great shape! One of my favorite all time movies! A must have for our DVD collection! Thank-You!!
0307463745|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this one - might even throw out some of the traditional business books on my shelf and recycle a tree!<br />I will recommend it highly for getting us to rethink how we need to work.<br /><br />Fiona Fine<br />Editor-In-Chief: WomenWhoRunIt.com
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Affleck has put himself in a league above others! Great screenplay, great cast, greatly executed film making. Best movie of the year!!!
0525953728|4.0|a breath of fresh air. Devoid of government misinformation. This account makes sense.<br />Brave men should be honored not threatened.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am one of the many horse loving people that is not able to ride a horse of her own so this game is absolutely one of the best things I have ever played.  Better yet, it is free!  I am using a tablet that did not come with Google Play or any of the better app stores, so it is expected that the game would be a little glitchy for me.  I have this game on my phone also and love it.  I would recommend it to anyone that is lookimg for a good, free horse game.
B004SK1Q4M|5.0|This is a movie that I have watched several times both alone and with my kids.  Leaves me rolling with laughter every time.  Now it is mine - mine - mine!

B003TSEEDY|4.0|Grabs you right in. Couldn't put it down, ended up finishing the book in one day it was so amazing.
B00AVASSZ8|5.0|A fabulous album, full of a variety of sounds... intertwining elements of jazz, hip-hop, r&b... with José James' smooth-as-honey vocals carrying you through each well-constructed song. The entire album is very mellow, sophisticated and moving.
B00000ING2|1.0|(I've amended this review to correct the chronology)<br /><br />The Hudsucker Proxy is supposed to be a comedy and yet it isn't funny. It marks the start of the Coen brother's lost period after the promising debut they made with Blood Simple, followed by Raising Arizona. The Hudsucker Proxy, which tells the story of how board members at a leading firm attempt to put an imbecile into the presidency so the stock will fall and they can buy it up on the cheap, followed Barton Fink, one of the worst films I have ever seen. The dialogue is unconvincing, the characters are boring, and the wretched movie just drags on and on through a valley of cliches. And yet after the two duds, this one and Barton Fink, they returned to form with Fargo.
B005JE7WKI|3.0|If I were to rate this movie simply on the performances by the two stars (Tucker and Dale, of course), this movie would get five stars. They're hilarious hillbillies who have a real knack for capturing the essence of the characters. Though bumbling and largely uninformed, they're well balanced by large quantities of humor, charm, and loyalty.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the \\"spin\\" that this movie puts on the classic \\"college kid horror flick\\", spoofing on many of the conventions of the old, tired genre. Oftentimes, it's hilarious. Yet, there was something off about the pacing, which prevented me from getting into the movie full swing. It just couldn't hold my attention. I had to watch it in 20-30 minute spurts, and then come back to it several days later, until I finally finished it. Nonetheless, it's a unique movie, and fans of the genre will undoubtedly be delighted.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I Have not bought a cd in many years,perhaps over 15 years.But after hearing this woman sing I had to own it!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I saw the previous three Bourne movies, and while I felt that they were okay, they ultimately did not make an impression on me, and I would have trouble recalling anything but the most basic of details. Therefore, I did not seek out \\"The Bourne Legacy\\", nor did I have any desire to watch it. However, a friend had it, and he encouraged me to watch it. I looked at the disc to see how long the run time was, and I groaned when I saw that it clocked in at two hours and fifteen minutes. Fortunately, I gave it a chance- and I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />From the very beginning, I was drawn into this story by the beautiful cinematography, the engaging way in which the plot was presented, and the subtle, superb acting. Though far from over-the-top, the action sequences are riveting, pulse-pounding, and convincing. All of Cross' moves carry a weight of absolute authenticity (probably due to an outstanding choreographer, more than anything else), which let me sink into the movie and become absorbed. Nothing in the realm of the action is outlandish, and so the movie seems \\"real\\".<br /><br />Though juiced up with some high technology and political conspiracy, this is essentially a simple revenge movie at its core. And that's part of what makes it great. In the previous three movies, Jason Bourne kept alluding to a desire for revenge against the agency, but he never seemed to mete out appropriate levels of justice. Cross makes up for that by exacting more revenge in one movie than Jason did in three. Fortunately, there are a few high level targets still standing, which makes me suspect Cross might come back to finish the job.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" is a modern action movie, done right.
B0083B3KOQ|5.0|now I can convert wmv to mp4 without getting on my dinasaur PC. Making my life simple is what I like technology to do. Thank you
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I love this dvd and i asure you that it will be a great item added to my collection of DVDs
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Big fan of horses this game is great and super fun. I do wish there is an easier way to earn diamonds. Fantastic game though
B009LXEBD4|5.0|is in great conditon as it was never used before...  the only thing i was surprised is that the CD case was broken when I happen to get the CD
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I really enjoyed the books and I must say, the show follows them almost exactly. As always, the books are better han the movie, but this definately gets as close as you can get to perfection. highly recomend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|For those of you who say this game does not update it does just look it up like you are trying to buy it and their it is instead of it saying buy it will say update so you click on it and their you go don't worry it will save you worlds with the new update
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it would probably be good if I could play it! it keeps on crashing on my kindle fire whenbi click on the app it loads for a sec then goes back to the home screen
B0007152JG|5.0|Book wonderful: read it while in London and with some effort tracked down the site of the no-longer-in-existence bookstore at the heart of the story.<br /><br />However, the purchase was flawed by the fact that only 84 Ch. Cross arrived - no Duchess of Bloomsbury St.<br />Disappointing, but Amazon was very accommodating in allowing me to order it from another source at no charge (also equally delightful book).  I had wanted original hardback copies rather than paperback reprints, which I did get with &#34;84&#34; but settled for paperback &#34;Duchess.&#34;
B00881VLCE|5.0|I would definitely recommend this app to anyone and everyone who is a fan of the good old fashioned jigsaw puzzle.
B002M9WW30|4.0|I was disappointed to pay extra for faster shipping only to find out afterwards this is when it would SHIP and NOT when it would be delivered.  Lost a star for sketchy wording of shipping terms. Otherwise, great series, no problems with the product!!! I've always loved Rocky and was excited to find the blu-ray box set.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Once you get started can't put it down. Have to see the challange for the next level and the next and the next.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is worth the space but before you get it you should know that it takes 1.1 GB of enternal storage
B000NJVWTQ|1.0|For some reason they thought that adding the preliminary demos would be a benefit to this album.  Be wary if you buy this album and only want the original tracks.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app helps me sleep very deeply. LOVE IT!  The ability to mix in as many sounds as you want makes it perfect for me and my busy mind.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked the first book but I could barely put this one down!<br />Every page held some new challenge. Horrible dangers were dreamt up by The Capitol.  Oh dear, what has happened to all friends and family?<br />I must do some housework before I start reading the last book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a funny mix of a module school life that I can relate to greatly...hope there is more to come.
B0098VXMNE|4.0|great script and acting!<br />my husband and i watched the first season and eagerly waited for this season. we watched all episodes in 1 weekend. addictive!
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Very cute. Fun to play with. Only thing to say that there should be more options.  Would tell friends about it.
B001NHNG64|3.0|The best thing about this series is that each one is well written enough to stand on its own. Lee Child continues the story of Jack Teacher in a sparsely written style that is all his own. Follow Teacher on a journey that spans the country as he attempts to save himself, a young FBI agent, and the nation as a whole. It appears that Reacher is not yet finished serving his country!
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a friend and I wasn't sure I would like it. Then I opened the cover and was so glad that I had gotten the trilogy! I am not going to give any of the story away except that it made me experience every emotion that my mind and body could muster up. It has been a long time since I have been emersed so deep into a story. I hope that the author continues to write her books this well because she has definitely got my attention and I can't wait for her next book!
B00785P2QC|5.0|loved it graphics good gameplay amazing could use more map availability and use of all land and have use of bridges to cross wwter to places
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This self indulgent book provides nothing coming even close to proof.  Since patient recovered, he obviously had some functioning cortex and certainly the experience of &#34;coming to&#34; would generate some weird dream-like perceptions, which might very well be &#34;hyper-real.&#34;  A very small portion of the book is devoted to his experience of heaven, which is totally cliched and incompatable with any Christian conception of Heaven.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book.  I am definitely a fan.  There isn't much else to say, but if you need a review, I guess I can try...<br /><br />The story line mirrors Twilight a bit, but it is definitely its own story.  Where Twilight was appropriate for teens, 50 Shades is definitely more of an adult novel.  Although it had no &#34;pornographic effect&#34; on me, it does include SEVERAL many GRAPHIC sex scenes, as you surely already know.  They were not written in a way that is too gross, kinky, or nasty to tolerate, or in a way that requires a preference for any specific sexual positions or activity.  The book only touches on some of the practices of BDSM, which in my opinion was quite minor.  I am NOT at all interested in BDSM, but this book was a very good read nonetheless because the main character (narrator) was also new to the idea and was not interested in pain (easy to relate to).  You can definitely LOVE 50 shades without an interest in BDSM, much how you can be a fan of Twilight without being passionate about the classic vampire stories.  *IF you are into BDSM, know that this is not hardcore at all, in case that might be disappointing.  No anal sex or cutting/bleeding is involved.*  Very soft, easy to relate to, and who doesn't want to find themselves in the &#34;red room&#34; with Christian Grey after reading this!?
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This stylus with its three different size tips is worth the higher price! I had initially purchased a Marware which only has a single tip, and I was constantly worried that I was going to accidentally use the wrong end and scratch my screen. When my stylus went missing (cat stole it), I searched for a dual tipped one and was thrilled to find this one! Works perfectly with my Kindle Fire HD, love the three different size tips and I will be sure to clip this one to tablet.  Thank you, Fluffy!
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|This app is awesome just because it allows me to journal in a more digital fashion.  The way to create, edit, and deletion is very simple and user friendly..
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Les Miz may well revive the musical genre.  The story flowed, the scenary was grand, beautiful and authentic, and the characters were compelling.  I came to care deeply about what happened to each person--even the policeman.  Finally, the music was rich, emotional, and always spot on.  Once I got into the form this movie took, the songs propelled the story nicely.  The only detraction for those of us who have not read the story or seen previous versions is that the movie version seemed to assume that we had a good idea of what was going on.  So, while I could follow the story, at times I felt a bit uncertain about what was happening.<br /><br />The bottom line that proves Les Miz is a winner?  My 12-year daughter bawled her eyes out!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book keeps you riveted. The story line traces the families rise and falls and triumphs from one book to the other smoothly.<br />Kenn Follett's style keeps you interested throughout the book. You try to figure out what will happen to each character next. Sometimes you guess right, other times you suprised.<br />Ken Follett still has the touch.  Anxiously awaiting the third book in the trilogy.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Not nearly as cheesy as the Old Bond movies, quite moderns and fun. Also, Javier Bardem might be the best Bond villain ever. So sick and evil and sexy all at the same time.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Story and action run smoothly and keep your interest. Hard putting the book down as one scene runs into the next smoothly and you want to see what's about to happen next.<br />Reminiscent of the style of writing as the old Tom Clancy stories in the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I figured it would be some scrappy graphic game, but it has great graphics and is fun to play. I would recommend giving this a try!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|For a few months I have not been able to make purchases with this app because it asks me to login but does not seem to recogonize my Username and PW.<br /><br />I am able to login into the cloud drive with no problem at all. Play music off the cloud drive, purchase and what not. But not from the APP!!!<br /><br />I am at a complete loss as to what is going on.<br /><br />I have tried COPY / PASTE, Manual typing and it always comes back with \\" Wrong USERNAME or PASSWORD \\".<br />( Again, I can login from the WEB with no issues at all )
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|The acting was natural which is what you would expect and appreciate to depict a true story such as this - suspense and realism was the key to this movie's success -  Well done  A++++++++
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This has them all.  All of the greatest songs by these Australian brothers.  The first CD is mostly their newer upbeat disco-type songs, and the second CD is filled with their amazing harmonies on a lot of the slower songs.  Both were amazing.  And an excellent sound mix!
B0044XV3QY|4.0|Awesome content. Extended scenes are pretty cool. IF you are a movie aficionado get it! If not save money and get the regular edition. They could have squeezed the entire thing onto one blurry disc I feel.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|I wanted it for my television through ROKU.  IT ended up being for a computer.  I was unable to watch it as I'd planned.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|Good movie only negative is that the ultraviolet is a pita. Having the ability to watch in dvd or bluray is nice.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Seems to be well made, not particularly strong enough for children however.  Sound is very weak, possibly due to batteries, I will try replacing them.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I love having all of her greatest hits on one CD.  She was one the best female vocalists of all time.
B005H9B44A|5.0|really enjoyed the mythical storyline.  i watched the movie because friends call me Thor due to resemblance so i had to watch it to see.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Angry birds Space is ppretty cool. Things actually move a bit like they would in space.  This means birds can orbit around objects before they crash.  This makes it very different from the regular angry birds games.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American horror story isnt so much scary but its such a thriller and I love it, both seasons are great and asylum is awesome
B0086700CM|5.0|My 4 year old son and my husband both love this game.  Clearly it's fun for all ages.  Fast paced moving game with beautiful graphics.
B00B37ET42|1.0|Back in high school, I was enthralled by F. Scott Fitzgerald. This was his one book I hadn't read, so I looked forward to enjoying another engrossing tale. Trust me, this one is boring. The characters find themselves &#34;special&#34; in that entitled, blase 1920s manner which comes across a lot more palatably in Fitzgerald's other works. I wanted to slap this bunch of tedious drones (especially that god-awful Gloria) from Beekman Place to Riverside Drive and back again. I prayed the two of them would end up living in grinding poverty on the lower east side in a miserable cold water tenement, but that prayer went unanswered. The only character who was remotely interesting was the old uncle who was killed off far too early to wreak proper havoc.
B000002H97|5.0|This has got to be one of the best rock Cds of all time.  It's a classic that everyone should have in their collection.  Super fast shipping.
0817439390|5.0|I think this is the best general book on photography out there. It will take you out of the auto mode on your DSLR and teach you why you set the camera to certain settings. It launched my hobby! I have recommended this book to countless people. If you get one camera book on your life, this would be it.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Great movie, fun, entertaining and more than just a few iconic quotes. Probably not every guy's movie; but I'm sure most guys laughed after they were drug to the movie by their girlfriend.
B0018QQQKS|5.0|Mr.  Ferguson has written a beautiful and thought provoking book about the history of finance. Weaves a polyglot of ideas into a marvelous read!
B000I9VOO4|5.0|What more is there to say? Not only should everyone read the book, but watch the movie and experience the struggle.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|the funniest part on this game is that it crashes and you won't be able to enter the game. Do not download.
B00633W614|5.0|I discivered, purchased and read all the Clifton Chronicles in 2 days. Jeffrey Archer is a master story teller. I have read everything written since I fell in love with his book &#34; First Among Equals&#34; oh so many years ago. Highly recommend; the characters seem so real that I almost weep at the end because I want the story to go on and on...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't believe I didn't read this sooner! The author keeps you wanting more and you've reached the end before you know it!
B003JR1JV0|5.0|Enjoyed watching the concert on DVD. The CD was good as well. I enjoyed the songs on this album, as well as enjoyed watching the DVD. Miley is a good singer/performer.
B00742LLKU|5.0|This is a magnificent collection of Debussy's music, but unfortunately it is not a complete edition - the Piano Trio in G major is missing. I cannot comprehend the decision not to include this chamber music masterpiece.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! I played it on my boyfriends phone and I fell in love with it, He gave me his phone
0446554995|5.0|This was a gift to a dear friend.  She is reading the book now, but said it looked terrific from the info on the cover.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|The songs I like have some good parts to them.There are two good guitar solos but the rest of the song in not very good.Also too many tracks.I would have left out about 5 or 6 songs.As a big fan I was disapointed.
1451613512|4.0|A mirror for a upside-down society that tries to describe to the rest of the world how to behave.<br />If the energy and resources that caused so much human made suffering had been put into a better use<br />the Sahara desert would be green.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Argo kept you on the edge of your seat and yet remained pretty factual to the historical event. I would recommend to anyone who likes history and action films. Ben Afflect did a great job acting and directing
B0020BUWX2|5.0|While this book was   sad it was amazing and truly gorgeous. i just love the way gayle foreman wrote this book.
B005LAII08|5.0|Not sure what else to say.  Works as expected, my daughter loved the movie, even good for the adults to watch.  Good packaging and fast delivery.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game I play it withe my 2 little cousins Its awesome GET IT so fun have to buy it
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is awesome. Add expansions and it becomes even more fun.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Wish it had more music options without upgrading and different color options but free is good! Looks good on bedside table!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|is a very good product ... highly recommended especially luxury packaging and design of their albums, is a perfect purchase
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|First off, I feel the permissions are relevant to the app, and the app capabilities. That said, the app is very helpful for my line of work, and my busy life. I forget everything, and I am constantly making lists for different business ideas etc. I like that you can create different notebooks, and that you can easily fullback and forth between the books. I could go on, but will not since there are thousands of reviews. Just love it!
B000QFW7UA|5.0|is a very good product ... highly recommended especially luxury packaging and design of their albums, is a perfect purchase
B0000047CW|5.0|I can remember feasting my ears to this album back in the early 2000. WoW was I blown away. Because it was the Verve label and I didn't have the bucks to fork out R300 roughly $38 without shipping my heart was broken. But as luck might have it Amazon had a bidding site going at the time and I purchased the CD incl. shipping for a mere R90 ($10). Since then I've been hooked on Latin from Samba to Bossa. Stan Getz have grown on me and although he passed on in the late 90's will live on forever through his music. I had the honors of getting a copy of his last live recording with Lynn Carrington and Kenny Barron in Germany, need I say more. To all the fans out there or if you planning on becoming one make sure that you add this album to your collection.
B001ER4CTI|5.0|is a very good product ... highly recommended especially luxury packaging and design of their albums, is a perfect purchase
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Tommy Lee Jones is always great ... but this movie didn't live up to his full talents. Still enjoyed the story, but it dragged in the middle.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|just an amazing cpu, for a budget, it just delivers so much, the graphics for a htpc are just so good, you can even do light to middle range gaming with this cpu, and when paired with a graphics card its just awesome for the price
B001DPHDCY|4.0|For a Disney production--most of which I avoid--this is a great story for kids whether they &#34;get it&#34; on the level an adult might.  The idea that there are universes within universes is an absorbing notion and standing up for what you believe even if you're a whimsical elephant carrying a weed . . . not a bad moral lesson.  Even a &#34;goth&#34; son has a place in this battle against petty-minded convention.  Who knows if later your child may recognize a bit of the Galileo story from this animation?  Dr. Seuss is sly.
0545123267|3.0|The book was in good condition but it was given this rating because it  was a large print book and I did not find large print edition in the seller's description.  I would not have purchased the large print edition.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very fun and amusing. Especially for road trips and long waits. Fun for every age. And if you have tried many times to beat a game it will give you some points or coins
B003FBMS4W|4.0|Although the film makes significant changes to the true story behind it, it is a good movie for it's time and something different for John Wayne.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|bleh. gross gross gross. this book:<br />waste of paper, time, money<br />makes my eyes bleed<br />had no detail whatsoever<br />left me confused and unsatisfied<br />:P
B008OOYALE|1.0|My son did not like it at all, which surprised me. So I had him play it with me there to see if he was just not understanding the full story. I was bored with it by 10 minutes.
B00BHMEALA|1.0|Literally fell asleep this thing was so boring. They really tried to make this interesting, but the whole movie is based around a simple task, then driving to the airport. Everything in between is what you'd expect a highschool freshman to write.<br /><br />Oscar Winning Film. LOL. Trash. Boring, cliched, uninteresting plot. Horrible.
B00004YRQA|5.0|The package arrived on time and the sender made sure it was package right and had concern for my satisfaction
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|I Saw The Previews For This Movie And Wanted To Go See It In Theatres And Didn't Get A Chance To So I Bought It In The Store. My Girlfriend And I Watched It And Liked It. This Movie Is Definitely Not For The Faint Of Heart. There Really Are Some Disturbing Scenes. This Main Character Guy Finds A Box Full Of Movies, Homeade Ones And A Super8 Projector. Each One Of The Individual Films Have Clever Names 'Family Hanging Out' Yeah Use Your Imagination For That. There Are Lots Of Eery Moments Trust Me. Theres Not A Whole Lot Of 'Boo' Moments That'll Make You Jump But You Cant Deny How Creepy Looking The Demon Character Is. The Story Line Was Good. It'll Have You Guessing And Scratching Your Head. The Ending Kinda Suprised Me, Some Of It Was Confusing But All Came Together In The End. If You Wanna See A Good Scary film Check This One Out! :) Also Check Out The New Silent Hill Revelation.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Could not put this down.  Terrific insight into family relationships - how well do you know your family members?  What would you do for your child?
0062014102|5.0|I really liked this book. It was easy to read and gave a down to earth explanation of this theory. He gave examples from both the scientific and the metaphysical worlds. I enjoyed it alot and then passed it on for others to do the same.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I heard about it, wasn't sure it was for me...and then, it was for me.  Hours of playing and trying to beat the levels was a ton of fun!!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|We loved Lord of the Rings, and now we have another favorite. It's even more fun to watch. Amazing how you can fall in love with the world Peter Jackson has created and all the characters. And Thorin just rocks, and Bilbo: what a great choise. Great casting and acting, great music, so much detail in everything. We are lucky that Peter Jackson took on the Hobbit too. He's just the best.<br />Watching the movie you can feel how much fun everyone had doing it.<br />We enjoyed every minute of the movie, and the way they worked characters from Tolkien's other books into the story was perfect. We are so looking forward to watch the rest of it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was very into the characters.  The author did a great job of development and the detail to the emotional states.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|One of those albums that almost every song is well-known. Definitely worth having in the collection. Download was quick and easy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it's rare that i am so engrossed in a book that it goes everywhere with me!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just could not quit watching all the episodes and when it ended I was really sorry until I read that they will have season 4, thanks goodness.  Beautifully made and love all the actors.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app is easy to navigate and has only continued to get better with each upgrade!  I find it very easy to use!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great characters and location with a simple plot make a very enjoyable humane comedy/drama. It is real good movie with no hungover.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was sucked into this book.  I didn't know what to expect, just that it was a buzz book.  Once i began reading it, i understood why it was the topic of much discussion.  I read this and the following two books within a week.  I couldn't stop reading!!  Excellent work by the author!
1741797802|5.0|First, to be honest, I haven't done an in depth examination of this book but rather a cursory overview;  we leave for India in a week and we wouldn't have time for this submittal while there.  I was most interested in the general information contained in the front and back portions of the book, although I looked at other information on specific locations in the country and found them to be very informative.  Overall, the thoroughness of the book is impressive;  the other side of that is the shear size/weight of the book may be an issue with some backpackers.  But how do you do put a comprehensive book together on a country like the sub continent of India?!  Nevertheless, the book is a far better choice than the &#34;Kindle&#34; version because the information is more accessible.  I bought a Kindle version of a book from Amazon before, a mistake I will never make again!<br />The Lonely Planet India book justly deserves a 5 star rating in my opinion.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the app for you.  I am always playing solitaire.  This gives you option for different types of the game and hours and hours of fun and frustration!
B000001FTN|5.0|I chose this for my grandaughter and she just loves it. I was so pleased to be able to find it so easily.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|An hour and a half of watching Ethan Hawke watch home movies. A &#34;villian&#34; without a line, or a point for that matter.  A &#34;twist&#34; at the end that you see coming 20 minutes before any of the characters do, and the main character is a crime writer... seriously, save your money.
0425263916|4.0|Like these books - can't wait for the next one! Good for an easy read when you need a break from other genres. Bought these since reviews I read mentioned that the characters are better defined than those in 50 shades - and I agree. I am a strong independent person, and I have to say 50 shades was pretty frustrating with his controlling issues - especially the latter half of the second book, and the last book. I see it here as well, but she gives it right back, and it didn't seem as intense. And the love scenes were totally hot!
0452295548|5.0|Jill Bolte Taylor's experience with her stroke is gripping and amazing as she uses her knowledge of the brain to watch the changes as she has and recovers from the stroke. It is informative and inspiring, helpful in recognizing symptoms, and has expanded my perception of how the brain works.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|I was SO excited to get this CD in the mail, and when I popped it in my computer, it didn't work. It was either blank, or dysfunctional. Very dissatisfied.
B007JWKLMO|4.0|Not as impressive as I wanted it to be, or as the hype suggested it would be as a film. Beatle fans know most of the story, but haven't seen much of the footage and photos, which are the most impressive part of this film. A must have for collectors,(show me a Beatle fan who's not), but might be tedious for casual fans or anyone introducing young people to The Beatles' legacy.<br /><br /> Olivia's telling of the break in and attack on George is particularly frightening and disturbing. As much as and in some ways more than Lennon's murder, because the guy didn't seem to know who's house he was in. I will watch it more than once and play it for friends that come to house.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|A good game and well worth the money paid. Nice mix of puzzles with an educational element. No hidden object scenes which i find too repetitive in other games.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Love it, love it, love it!  Hav  e waited since the last Idol show for this cd to come out.  It was well worth the wait!!

0857897764|2.0|Cheryl \\"Strayed\\" wrote a work that is not about hiking or self discovery, but just about her. She is Wildly self absorbed. She discusses every little thing in her life--including her bowel movements on the ground after squatting--yet never addresses the inner self that I expected from a woman-in-the-wilderness book. There is no \\"there\\" in her work. Who has an abortion shortly before such a hike and barely considers it on the page? It is a memoir by someone I find quite deeply superficial. And for a self-described feminist, she seems completely dominated by every man she meets. I gave her two stars instead of one because the book is not poorly written sentence to sentence.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I originally got this movie on the special edition collector's DvD when it was first released.  I have since gotten the Blu-ray version and I must say it looks gorgeous.  Plus, it has more special features than any of the DvD versions.<br /><br />&#34;Batman: Under the Red Hood is a 2010 direct-to-video animated superhero film based on the Batman storylines &#34;A Death in the Family&#34; and &#34;Under the Hood&#34;.  The film is the eighth in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies line released by Warner Premiere and Warner Bros. Animation.  It was released on July 27, 2010.  The film stars Bruce Greenwood as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Jensen Ackles as the Red Hood/Jason Todd, and John DiMaggio as the Joker.  The screenplay was written by Judd Winick, who also wrote the &#34;Under the Hood&#34; run in the monthly Batman comic.&#34;
B006M4F67A|4.0|I've been playing this game A LOT since I bought it. There are a couple of levels that I still can't get 3 stars on so I keep on playing! A good time waster.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Another fantastic movie that came around at a time when this kind of thing was a lot more possible in peoples' imagination than it is nowadays.<br /><br />Great actors, great movie. I'll be watching this one probably a few times a year just because it's that good (so much better than the garbage coming out of Hollywood for the last decade!).
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I've read some of the other reviews, and I disagree with some things. It does allow you to mix sounds together, I use frogs mixed with crickets myself. (I'm from the country and it sounds just like a summer night) I also read that it asks for a rating all the time. I have had this app for weeks now and this is the first time that I have been asked. The only problem that I have is with the fact that many of the sounds are not relaxing at all and some are just annoying! But, I don't have to listen to those, and I'm sure that new ones will be added as time goes on. :)
0143106333|5.0|I loved this book, because it has inventions which I couldn't even imagine. Almost every chapter is filled with surprises and has many interesting characters.<br /><br />The story is about a little boy named Charlie Bucket. He lives with his parents and 4 old grandparents in a tiny hut. He longed for chocolate more than anything else. One day the owner of a chocolate factory that was 50 times as big as a usual factory announces \\" I have hidden 5 golden tickets around the world inside a chocolate bar \\"signed by Willy Wonka. Charlie gets a golden ticket by luck along with 4 other children. The 4 children are very different from Charlie and they are funny to read about. They are Augustus Gloop, who loves to eat, Verca Salt who is a rich spoiled girl, Mike Teavee who loves to watch TV and loves to play videogames, and Violet Beauragrade who loves to chew gum. All the children  take a journey in Mr.Wonka's factory. They see many wonders like a chocolate waterfall, square candies that look round, and a chocolate television etc. This is my favorite part of the book. I also like the part where the kids give into their weaknesses and get into trouble. I won't give away the ending, but it is a happy ending.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to kids who love fantasy and adventures. I'm sure they'll enjoy this book, especially all the adventures in Wonka's factory.
0060012234|5.0|It was a wonderful book to read. The ending was not what I was thinking at all. It had the connection to keep me reading

B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I recieved this cutter and used it right away. All the bottles I cut came out perfect everytime. I had tried other methods of cutting glass and this is the way to go. I recommend this product to anyone that is in to crafts and glass cutting like I am.<br />GREAT ITEM
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|great movie, I didn't like the actor chosen for Peta.  Love jennifer lawrence in this film. She did a great job.
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|There were way too many characters introduced in this pilot. Some of the lines were a bit cheesy. YES, we get it! The killer LOVES Edgar Allan Poe... no need to shove his name down our throats! I'll give it 2 more episodes but if Poe is mentioned more than once on the 2nd episode then nevermore!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book of a series of three really gets you involved at the first page.  Set in the future, the events can represent what happens in our own time.  Media  attention whores, starving children, the chance to get ahead at someone else's expense, genetically mutated creatures used to control and destroy...I can't wait to read the next two.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Well designed time waster.  Should have a way to review scores without going to Twitter to brag or admit defeat.
0670026603|5.0|I read a very good review of this book and so I ordered it and finished it in less than a day. Once I started it, I could not put in down, which does not happen too often for me. I usually get so fed up with fiction plots, that I rarely read fiction unless someone has made a recommendation. While the plot is not necessarily totally believable, which is usually a turn off for me, I found the main characters interesting and so I kept reading. I think this book would make a good book discussion choice.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Read through these books in days.  Couldn't put it down.  I have been patiently waiting for the final installment.  Highly recommend.  If you enjoyed the Hunger Games you will like this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game live the clarity of the picture and how you get to train for your own games and feed and groom your own horse
B007IK44CK|3.0|Honestly, I haven't seen the movie all the way through yet. My issue is that Amazon's viewer works horribly on my Android device.  Time to move away from Flash!  Not sure of the solution but am looking...
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I've read this book multiple times since middle school, and it never fails to make me laugh.  Interestingly enough, it's the wide panoply of secondary characters that gives it such color; if it was just Sophie and Howl, I think the story would be rather restrictive and claustrophobic.  Either way, it's quite enjoyable for both children and adults.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Ok I think we all knew the katniss was going to chose peeta and they were going to have kids by the first book. But I didn't not see the assassination on coin coming that was a BIG turn of events. Loved this series and I plan on reading it 11more times. Btw can't wait to watch the Catching Fire movie!!!!

B00A81MV3U|5.0|Struggling and living with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, I found the movie to be a beautifully subtle, accurate and honest portrayal of mental illness...I was not expecting laughs or a romantic comedy, nor a clinical dissection of bipolar disorder and depression...I was not sure what to expect, but I deeply related and recognized parts of my life in the story and its characters...Pat's episode leaving him with the task of putting his life back together and starting over, probably not for the last time...having to move back and live with parents that many times feel helpless when they don't know, as much as we don't know, what we need...unemployment, failed relationships, feeling 'less than', different, like we don't fit in...the older than our years wisdom that we acquire from years of suffering, dealing with our demons and doing &quot;a lot of therapy&quot;, the long list of medications we have tried looking for something that works and learning to accept the side effects, the realization that we are not the only ones with issues, that we are all, in the end, just human beings and everyone around us is struggling with something and that we all have our strengths and weaknesses....<br /><br />My favorite part was the powerful scene towards the end of the film where they (**SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT***) get a low score on their dance routine and are happy and ecstatic despite not meeting the standards of the competition....I was so touched by that scene and such a heavy load was lifted off my shoulders...the scene was, to me, a powerful reminder that we do not have to meet the expectations of others or be what society considers &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;successful&quot;...all we have to do is our personal best and enjoy the ride, and that alone is reason to celebrate!<br /><br />It was a beautiful movie, and it helped me feel more at peace with myself than I have in years...it made me feel proud of my journey and of the fact that I am different and successful in my own way...for that, I am grateful to director David O. Russell, to his son who has struggled with mood disorders, to the amazing cast and to Matthew Quick who wrote the book from which the director adapted the screenplay :)<br /><br />I can't wait to own the movie and also read the book!<br /><br />------<br /><br />&quot;No matter what happens on Oscar night, we hope-and believe-that everyone will keep talking.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I never played before but found this game to be very fun and helps to excercise my memory and thinking.
0307949486|5.0|This is an excellent novel for those who like a complex story line, a detective investigation without the official police with 3 dimension characters.  A book you cannot put down.

B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Can't seem to find any other place on Amazon's website to register this complaint, so I thought I'd sound off here.  Maybe there is someone else with the same problem.  I am hearing impaired, so movies that include closed captions are much more enjoyable for me.  For reasons known onlyto the demi-gods of Amazon, very few titles in their film catalog include closed captioning.  I like everything else about Amazon's movies on demand service, but since they have decided that the hearing impaired do not fit into their business model's targeted customer, I won't bother browsing the titles they have to offer any more.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This movie is for adult the plane sence is great.  It shows the effects of alcohol in the life of a person can destroy it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|When I first started reading this book, I was wondering what all the fuss was about.  I was pleasantly surprised by the time I got about half way through.  It is definitely a book where the gimmicks pay off, however, without the gimmicks I am not sure it would be more than a decent read in the genre.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Each of these books is the first book in a series.  Great idea!  I will definitely be getting more books in these series.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I can't believe how addicting this game is. I start playing it and an hour later I'm still playing it.
044042321X|5.0|This purchase met all of my expectations.  I would recommend this to anyone and everyone that enjoy or have enjoyed the works of George R. R. Martin.
B000FBFMFW|4.0|This was a great book but the first one was better. I didn't feel as attached to fitz. There should have been more emotion showed by fitz. Overall this book was great and Leone from sleeping many nights.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This Lifeproof Case was no good.  It was not a genuine product.  The phone was dropped once and the &#34;lifeproof&#34; case broke.  The only pro that I can get from this whole process is that my money was refunded without a problem.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|It's not fair to make comparisons but I enjoyed &#34;The Girl&#34; more than &#34;Hitchcock&#34;. However, it was enjoyable even though I felt the B-plot was thin and not really believable. We never really learn WHY the characters are the way that they are and do what they do. More back story on Hitch and Alma would have helped. I rarely find myself asking for more exposition, but it would have been helpful here. Maybe the powers that be thought all audience members would be familiar with the Hitchcocks' relationship.
B000EB73NC|5.0|this is easy to install, you can easyly mount and remove your polar computer, good price and value, very sturdy
1576754227|5.0|It took me a few tries to understand and interpret the 21 ways, so really focus on reading or listening to this. In my opinion, the 21 ways is a 21 item buffet or ala carte.  A few of the methods really stood out for me, and translated well into my environment.  I recommend you take out a notepad and write down the ones that make sense to you. This changed my life, maybe it can change yours too. Thank you Brian Tracy!

B007I2BZIE|1.0|Well, it appears to be official.  Rush is dead.  Oh, the band may play on, but their inspirational and creative way of making music had died a quiet death.  This collection is completely uninspired, even worse than Snakes & Arrows, which contained only a handful of songs worth listening to.  The musicality is muddy and uncertain.  The concepts are non-existent and the vocals are often actually boring.  Its as if someone put together some elevator music and Rush decided it would make a good album.  To borrow a line from \\"Caravan\\", I can't stop thinking this is the worst Rush album I've ever listened to.  The best way I could describe it is...boring.  I've been a Rush fan since the late 70's, but there always comes a time when a band need to accept the inevitable.  No one can continue creating great music forever.  Rush's time has ended.  The band has simply run out of ideas.  It's time to stop.  Now.  Please.<br /><br />I'll add that I scooped up this album when Amazon put it on sale and I'm glad I did.  I probably won't get more than two full listens out of it, so it certainly isn't worth more than $5 for me.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|See the movie first before reading this. 'Limitless' is one of those movies that you can show to anyone and know they will be hooked from beginning to end. This movie has all the fun stuff in it, suspense, action, romance told at a brisk pace, but also lots of life and business lessons; Our hero Eddie gets access to 100% of his brain by using a smart pill called NTZ. He tells us via narration,&#34;Everything I'd ever read, seen and heard was now organized and available.&#34; After hooking up with higher caliber friends (his useless relationships are &#34;better forgotten and put away in mothballs,&#34; he says) and going to  Puerto Valletta, Eddie says,&#34;Mere lounging wasn't enough. Suddenly I knew what I needed to do. But it would take money to get there.&#34;<br /><br />In the beginning of the film, when Eddie is standing on the ledge of the building ready to jump, he talks about &#34;Wanting to make an impact on the world, instead of the pavement.&#34; When explaining his book in the bar, Eddie mentions a 'utopian society.'  So we can guess that his final goal might be helping the world. When Eddie is accused of having 'delusions of grandeur' he retorts with, &#34;I have an actual recipe for grandeur.&#34; Ah, a plan. Definite plans get definite results. Indefinite plans do not get 'indefinite results', they get NO results. Eddie says, &#34;I was clear. I knew what I needed to do, and how to do it.&#34;<br /><br />Eddie says, &#34;There are moments in your life when you cross a bridge and know that your old life is over.&#34; And while a high level of success is necessary to express our true selves, Eddie cautions us with, &#34;We are all wired to over reach. Look at history, all the countries that ruled the world. No one stopped and said, 'We've got France, Poland, a big Swiss bank account. Let's not invade Russia in the winter. Let's go home, pop a beer and live on the interest.'&#34; Yes, better not fulfill the Peter Principle and rise to our level of our incompetence.<br /><br />DeNiro makes a good point about earning your power by experience. He tells Eddie: &#34;Your super intellect is a gift from God, but you didn't earn it because you're careless with your power, flashing it around like a trust fund child. You never had to earn it year by year. You don't know how to assess your competition because you never had to compete.&#34;<br /><br />Finally, Eddie's success in now internalized and natural. When he speaks to a waiter in Chinese, his girlfriend looks at him in awe. Eddie turns to her, sees her expression and says, &#34;What?&#34;<br /><br />Leaving the theater after seeing 'Limitless' I heard some guy say, &#34;I wish I had the pill.&#34; But all that Eddie does in this movie can be accomplished without the pill. See for yourself.ncompetence.<br /><br />DeNiro makes a good point about earning your power by experience.

B0031TZ8TU|3.0|Interesting but not great literature. I chose because of the history. The EDS employees and the leadership of Ross Perot were outstanding. Yes I would recommend this. It was informative of the events in IRAN and the failure of our government for backing the wrong horse.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|Excellent movie. So very glad I purchased it. Still a very timely  review of what is going on in today's world.
0765325950|5.0|I think that Brian Sanderson did an excellent job of completing the Wheel of Time series begun by Robert Jordan. There were a lot of loose ends to be tied up but he did so very well. I loved the ending. I would recommend this book and the entire series for anyone who loves this type of fantasy novels.
B001BRJZPW|5.0|Excellent movie. So very glad I purchased it. Still a very timely  review of what is going on in today's world.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|We had to add this movie to our collection as it is not shown on TV very often and not yet offered on line. The DVD arrived very promptly and was in great condition. Great packaging and would buy again from this seller, no problems at all. Thank you!
1423101502|4.0|I liked this book but felt that it still left some things hanging in the air, like there should have been a little more to finish it off. A good set to own though.
B00846F1YW|2.0|The games themselves were ok, but the storyline attached with this game is way too hokey.  It would be fine without the storyline.  I usually don't mind cheesy, because sometimes cheesy is all out funny...this however was ridiculously terrible.  I couldn't finish the game because it got on my nerves.  Uninstalled after a few levels.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This game is simple and very cute with desirable graphics. I'd give it a 5 star if it weren't asking for outrageous prices for in game money called &quot;bling&quot;. Bling is difficult to earn in the game. It's so irritating how one of the quest givers requires you to spend precious bling. There is also a pet you can buy for over a thousand bling which is about 100 dollar in American money. I don't like this game trying to sell me a cute animated character for $100. That's just stupid. If I didn't feel like the game was trying to scam me I'd give it a 5. *Make sure you set a password on your device, you don't want to purchase $100 of worthless game money by mistake.*
1609611543|5.0|I asked my wife if she would do an experiment with me to cut out wheat for at least a week with me and see how it goes. She said OK and two weeks later my wife lost 10 lbs and I have lost 7 lbs. Most of it certainly was water weight but we have managed to kept it off and were still losing weight(wife is currently at 12 and I'm at 9).<br /><br />We have both experienced the withdrawal effect of not having wheat the first few days but it got easier after 5 days. We now have both energy throughout the day and we always feel bloated after eating wheat. It looks like my wife is more sensitive to wheat since she feels more of the negative effects and how fast she is losing more lbs than me even without doing any exercise at all.
B002N9MK8G|5.0|For me, this is the one Frank album to have since I'm not really a collector.  These are mostly he upbeat, fun songs that I really like.  AND with Count Basie, whose albums I do collect -- can't do better than this album.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Several friends saw this movie with no knowledge of the story, and it brought them to tears.  I had heard about Rodriquez and the film on 60 Minutes so I knew the ending so to speak, and it did not lessen the impact.  I'm so glad Rodriguez was found, and that he's touring!
B00881VLCE|4.0|It's a good app, freezes sometimes but other than that I don't have much else to say. I like all the options to get different puzzles, that's a big plus.

0786955554|3.0|There are lots of pieces that come with set that work really well for expanding and fleshing out the other dungeon tile sets.  You can create some interesting maps with this set by itself, but it really works best when combined with other sets.  I would still consider it a must by though, because it gives you so many options when fleshing out dungeons.

B006RUJST6|5.0|This was, by far, one of the best books I've read in months. (As someone who reads about five books a week, that says a lot) The story line and characters were fantastically written and believable. I really enjoyed the deviation from the typical plot line that saturates the market and brought such depth of emotion from me as the reader. Thank you Colleen Hoover for such an enjoyable read!
B001HIJYR4|4.0|If you are willing to suspend disbelief this movie is really good.  I mean the whole movie is based of a premise of a secret society that is able to bend bullets and has a hit list that helps the world.  That being said, the acting was great. James McAvoy is great as a loser who learns to become a strong &#34;hero&#34;.  I don't particularly enjoy Angelina jolie, but she doesn't bother me in this  movie.

B000K4WPCC|3.0|Not a bad movie, but not really a great movie either.  About four pretty boys with powers, their struggles with adolescence and a new mysterious pretty boy also with powers that is there to destroy them.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|It just love seeing these guys especially Chuck Norris.  I really had a good time watching it.  The action was great.  I was never bored
B002AT4K9G|4.0|After having a couple movies that really had nothing to do with the original movie, except one dealt with Paul Walker on the run and Tokyo had Vin Diesel in it for 2 seconds.  The fifth movie brings all the movies together connecting the franchise by supporting actors from the previous films.  It is a good movie that has a little more depth than just racing to steal stuff to be rich.  Also, there is a nice twist at the end credits that sets up the next movie.  Although I feel like they could just end the series here and be fine.
B006LSZECO|4.0|...but the rest of the book was very good.  I'm a Dateline/48 Hours Mystery junkie, so this was right up my alley.  And I'm not the world's most avid reader, but I couldn't put it down!  Like so many people, I wanted to key Flynn's car over the ending, but oh well.
0062082353|5.0|I decided to purchase Chris Kyles book because I have been trying to keep abreast of the true feelings of those who have served our Great Country in the past and present.<br />It was with sadness in my heart when I learned that Chris was killed by a social misfit of our society.<br />I have laminated and placed a copy of the news story in the back as a reminder of how ill gotten our society has become.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|...I had to FORCE myself to finish it and only forced myself because it was a book club selection.  E L James is quite possibly the worst writer ever to be published.  Clearly, the only &#34;value&#34; of the book was the sex appeal it seemed to have to bored housewives.  However, I have to say that as a stay-at-home-mom/housewife myself, I found nothing sexy about it at all.  The writing was so stilted and contrived that the eye-rolling I did was far from orgasmic.  In fact, it made me NOT want to have sex with my husband.  I  should have just skipped the book club that month.

B001HNE3NO|2.0|I downloaded this book because it was recommended by my Kindle store.  I even offered it up as a selection to my book club after reading the first few chapters.  I liked the parallel story lines, Sarah's surely compelling story, and the anticipation of how Julia would unravel all the threads of that story.  But then the plot turned and Sarah almost became an afterthought.  Julia's unappealing self-involvement usurped Sarah's struggle, and I lost all interest.  I finished the book, hoping with every chapter that the story would get back on track, but it never did.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It was a little hard at first..I wanted to try it out before I put it on my nieces kindle. She loves horses..she will love this..it is so real looking..
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Good writing, easy to follow, though unnecessarily long. The main male character was a little effeminate and wimpy than I would have liked. Knew way too much about women's clothes.  For the most part the females in the story are strong and committed. Would like to see sequel.

B005LAIH4A|5.0|My family and I love this movie. It haves a great story line, gets kids thinking about the Earth. It's very colorful, funny and over all great movie
0143034901|3.0|A fun, superbly written book about a kid in Barcelona whose life-story becomes unexpectedly intertwined with a mysterious missing and presumably dead writer.  I would give more stars if it wasn't unintentionally silly at times.  Like the portion near the end where a sideline-character explains everything, including things she couldn't possibly know, as though she is herself writing a literary account.  Also, the women in the book are a little...um...objectified?  Maybe that's how it was in Spain. I don't know.  But I loved how the book really draws you in and makes you feel like you know Barcelona.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great characters, Romantic and dealt with real life issues. Was well written and enjoyable.  A wonderful read to get caught up in!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|CD is excellent.  He's a songwriting genius.  The music is wonderful.  I want to get up and dance at work.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|Since  I missed the most of first season on tv , it was great to catch up with this DVD. Great show  watched it for hours. Sound and quality were good. If you haven't watched Downton Abbey  you will definitely get hooked  if you purchase this DVD.  Can't wait to watch the next season. This can go on forever, truly enjoyable.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|it was quite interesting to a certain degree. it was really hard to keep my focus solely on the book . all in all it was okay i guess. well that all.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|As always, Amazon delivers. Showed up on time and in tact as usual. Great series, there's nothing like Game Of Thrones! Great characters and plot. Every episode throws you deeper and deeper into the turmoil. Great show!
098478280X|5.0|I wish I'd had this a few years ago!  It prepares the reader for technical interviews at software firms.  This book takes a few years of experience, distills it, and puts it in easily digestible form.  This is a nice compilation of issues, and how to deal with them, in a tech interview.  Interviews are theater, however one needs to have glib background material ready.  You don't want to memorize this, you want to practice repeatedly, until it comes effortlessly.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This sylus is all I had hoped it would be!! Works well, and the design with the 3 different size tips is a really nice feature!
B0064W639K|4.0|Very cool noir-style art, and fills in a cloudy period in Batman's history. The one serious drawback of this GN is that Wayne feels very 'rich,' a side of his personality I've always struggled with. A bit heavy on this cliché, too.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|Plug it in the kindle, plug into the tv and turn them on. Go to input on your TV and change to HDMI 1 or 2, wherever you have your Kindle. BooM! There it is is. This is great when you are taking instruction or learning how to use something AND you want to share with friends.

B004XCUEXY|5.0|This is excellent for seeing some real behind-the-scenes looks into an awesome band. Hearing Dave Grohl explain his thoughts and opinions of every aspect of the Foos is interesting, from the band members, to getting rid of ones who didn't fit, to writing songs, to how the songs have to match what he hears in his head, etc., lets you inside what makes the Foos awesome.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really amazing. It gives you so much information about how long your device will last in certain scenarios, e.g. '1hr 42mins during internet browsing' and so on. This helps preventing me from charging for too long an  ruining the battery life. I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD and it runs perfectly. It even comes with cute little perks such as the choice to change the colour of the battery fluid! I would definitely recommend this app to everyone. It's so good, I might even Invest in Battery HD Pro. Get it now!

B001TH16DI|4.0|Nice packaging, great value (probably even more now than when i bought them). the biggest problem is simply that the version of Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the theatrical release and not the superior directors cut. Unfortunately they short-sightedly made the directors cut special effects for standard def- dvd even though High-Def was well on the way.

B0050DZ8J0|4.0|This app offers almost everything that the computer version offers. You can obtain any messages from the bottom bar, view profiles, updates, and people you may know. You are able to see and edit your profile as well as see your groups too. The slight problem I had with the app was that it wasn't really user friendly. That is important to me as I need my apps to be able to move just as fast as my life.<br />Everything is there to use on the app; it is just difficult to find them. For example, your messages come up at the bottom but when you click on them; they go to the top. I do not understand many of the reasons they configured it the way they did. But it does serve it's purpose with a little bit more investigation into the small buttons.<br /><br />I will definitely be keeping this one on my Kindle and that is always a plus.<br /><br />Regards,<br />~ Holley Jacobs

B0084U0IEG|2.0|Ian McEwan is a fine wordsmith, but after slogging through half the book, I found it trivial and nearly meaningless - the meanderings inside the mind of a young woman recruited into the British Secret Service, and finally I realized I couldn't care less about what she (or rather McEwan masquerading as her, or something like that) thinks about all sorts of miniscule topics. Maybe it picks up and something interesting happens, but not at least well into the first half of the book when I just gave up.
0345803485|1.0|The jokes on us!! I was looking forward to reading these books but as I started reading I realized I had been duped!  50 shades trilogy is written from the standpoint of an immature, virginal (yet willing), beautiful, pliable, sex-starved college girl(every man's fantasy??)  Save your money and wait for these books to show up in the bargain bin at your local supermarket or dollar store.

0887306667|5.0|Sometimes we like to think that in the here and now we as a culture understand the world around us better. It's an appealing notion, but sometimes truths are so fundamental that it can't be that they can get any more sound. This book embodies that, and though many of the examples are dated it doesn't matter a wit since they are only there to illustrate an underlying point. Follow the guidelines laid out in this quick and easy read and you will be ahead of 85% of the commercial adventurers out there by the tie you arrive at the back cover.

0307719219|5.0|.Why Nations Fail is an extraordinary book about nations in prosperity and poverty and how they are different.  They point out that prosperous countries have strong centralized governments that secure property rights, law and order are inclusive and allow freedom of communication and press.  Countries that are poor tend to have extractive political and economic institutions.  There is an elite who controls political development and economics as well.  Authoritarian governments such as the Soviet Union can prosper for awhile but the lack of innovation and ability for all society members to mobilize eventually breaks the country down.  Countries such as Somalia with no centralized government tend to have competing clans running small parts of the country and to centralize could mean loss of power to a group so they don't prosper.  Acemoglu and Robinson provide examples through history of places that prospered and lost and ones that rose to prosperity.  Rome initially a kingdom, became a republic which included Romans both Senators and Plebeians had rights and were represented in Rome.  Not all people were included but many people were.  The republic prospered for a long time but soon there were arguments over property rights.  Tiberius Graccus was murdered by senators for wanting to expand land rights to plebs.  Julius Ceasar wanted to include Gauls and other conquered provinces into Roman society and governance.  Augustus expanded territory but created an authoritative government which extracted riches from conquered provinces and so many slaves that Romans had little to do.  Wealth and prosperity lasted through his term but as time went on, innovation and prosperity waned.  Government centralization faded and invaders and the rule of law broke the empire.  An example of a society that prospered is England and eventually Great Britain.  Absolute monarchy came as the government centralized but through several conflicts, the Magna Carta, the British Civil Wars, and finally the Glorious Revolution spurred a more participatory government.  I found the examples in the book and the discussion about how nations prosper or fail to prosper fascinating.  I think of my United States where gays are being included in the nation as a good step forward, but also think of the treatment of immigrants as concerning, as well as changes in education in which the government is taking less responsibility for while privatizing schools into charter schools.  The media is also facing a more secretive government that is attempting to control it.  The gap between rich and poor is also growing.  I see myself as being concerned about the United States being able to continue its prosperity.  Great book.ally the Glorious Revolution spurred a more participatory government.

B006N9XHLQ|5.0|I wish that I had reviewed each book in this series after I had read them the first time ... but I didn't.  I just bought the next one and kept reading!<br /><br />This series at times broke my heart.  I think this is why you need to read the series from start to finish in order.<br /><br />This book, the last book, ended it perfectly.  THe emotional growth that Jake (in particular) went through was amazing and the end of the book - when Jake was expressing his feelings were powerful and beautiful.<br /><br />If you are thinking of buying this book but haven't read the earlier ones - then I recommend you start with book 1.<br /><br />This book is on my keeper list - it is there to stay!

B003VANOFY|5.0|Purchased this headset specifically for the use on work calls. My \\"work phone\\" has been software-based for years, and I've used many different wired headsets to conduct calls, all of which do nothing for isolating background noise.<br /><br />Reading through other reviews of this headset, I decided to trust the noise cancelling function of this mic... and I am VERY pleasantly surprised. I tested this morning by starting a call (leaving a voicemail on my own cell phone), then walking within 6' of a TV at moderate volume, saying a few words myself, then staying quiet for a few seconds.  After about 30 seconds of that, I played back the voicemail and didn't hear *any* of the background TV noise. Exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />All the rest of the features are cool, very cool, but none of them are as truly useful to me as I wanted these for professional voice-grade use. No longer do I have to distance myself from my toddlers when I'm working from home and on work calls!
B0083SBMBM|3.0|I buy all my movies from one specific vendor on Amazon because they always are truthful about the quality of their movies.  unfortunately this movie has several spots that are unwatchable.

The 3D on Polar Express had lots of red around the heads and greens around the mouth.  Just couldn't get it to adjust where you didn't see double and halo's. I tried it with the glasses that came with my TV and also the cheap 3D glasses that came with the DVD, nothing worked.  I would not recommend this product.  You get what you pay for.

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Bruce Willis seems to likes Sci Fi, time travel, super mental powers, and movies that require a lot of creative editing to move the story along.  Looper falls into the same.  Even though it only garnered 3.5 stars here on Amazon, I took it for a spin, and actually really enjoyed it.  Normally, I find 99% of movies to be fairly predictable, even the ones that claim to have \\"surprises\\" in them.  This flick gets around that by building some well edited and kinda freaky scenes on top of an easy to understand premise.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt (playing the main protagonist, Joe) starts out slow, but eventually builds into a nice younger version of Bruce (the older Joe), complete with smirk (he probably studied that in the mirror for a while to get it just right).  Joe is not exactly the best good guy out there.  He definitely takes the road of self preservation first, but somehow manages to come around to a fitting end, for his character and for the movie.<br /><br />The acting overall is not bad.  The action sequences are pretty good. There is not a lot of need for special effects or very fancy CGI to make this movie hum.  The plot moves along at a nice pace to keep you engaged throughout the movie but also to understand the implications of each scene and how it fits into the \\"time travel\\" premise.
034580404X|5.0|These books have helped keep me preoccupied through some pretty horrific things. They were an easy and very enjoyable read. Was sceptic at first with what I had heard about the books but ended up loving every part about them! Highly recommended them!
B00AIA89HS|5.0|I've been a big fan of Hatebreed for ten years now. I've always enjoyed how they've delivered their brand of brutal, relentless, no nonsense, unforgiving, and unstoppable hardcore metal with every album they've put out, and their newest release, 2013's \\"The Divinity of Purpose\\" proves no different whatsoever. This is definately Hatebreed's best album thus far, it is just pure fist pumping, ball busting intensity from start to finish, it doesn't disappoint one bit. The production quality is just sharp and awesome thanks to the band's collaboration with Zeuss and new producer Josh Wilbur, and the lyrics are strong and positive as always. Frontman Jamey Jasta's vocals are just as intense and commanding as an angry drill sergeant throughout. The guitars are simple, yet very metallic, catchy, and bone crunching, and of course the grooves and breakdowns are awesome as well, and the drumming is just fast, intense, and skull pounding throughout. Standouts on here include the addictive, scorching, ball busting opener \\"Put it to the Torch\\", \\"Honor Never Dies\\", \\"Own Your World\\" (which features a catchy call-and-response verse of \\"Who's got more heart than you?/NO ONE!\\"), \\"The Language\\" (which has a brief, but blistering guitar solo), \\"Indivisible\\" (which has some awesome skate-punk riffs and drumming throughout), \\"Dead Man Breathing\\" (one of the more slower tracks, yet it still pummels and crushes you like a bug), \\"Boundless (Time to Murder It)\\", and my personal favorite track \\"Nothing Scars Me\\" (which is very catchy and mosh pit worthy, and guaranteed to become a concert favorite as well). All the songs are awesome, but those are my highlights. Bottom line, \\"The Divinity of Purpose\\" is simply all straight up intensity, short and sweet to the point, and never disappoints whatsoever. Highly recommended for all Hatebreed fans...Buy it now!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is fantastic. It sure made FB run smoother. Before I downloaded it, it was frustrating to say the least.
B000M341QO|2.0|If a movie is exciting and shocking,  my two oldest grandsons, who can suspend belief easier than me, like movies like this. I hated it and felt I wasted my time and money on it. I don't mind a movie having a few coincidences that are largely unbelievable, but this one had way too many.  The way they show the violence done by Costello or for Costello and the fact he just walks around town like any man, is ridiculous.  Either one or more of his victims, including his own men, would have bumped him off long ago.  I don't mind violence in a film if the story seems real, but I felt the director went for the shock value and the heck with the story.  Violence, more violence and ever more violence was supposed to make this an exciting movie and for some I am sure it worked.  If violence, sex, dirty jokes, and cursing fit the story I'm all for it being included.  The Departed, however, just seemed too contrived and the just too many holes in the story ruined everything.  The acting, though, was usually top notch.  What a waste of acting talent!

0385338910|4.0|This might be an odd similie, but this book is, in a certain way, like &#34;Indecent Proposal.&#34;  If you recall the movie, a fairly good-looking older guy pays $1 million dollars to sleep with another man's really good-looking wife.  When the movie came out, one reaction was akin to &#34;Why not have a movie where a disgusting, smelly, obese, crass and lecherous man offers to pay $10 million dollars for a week with another man's ultra-hot wife? or $250,000 for three hours?  Now THAT would be a DIFFICULT decision.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;How to Talk to a Widower&#34; involves a 29-year-old man, Doug, who's wife of two years, Hailey (about nine years his senior), died in a plane crash.  Doug sits around the house, drinking and grieving and not really having to work because of the big settlement he got from the airline.  It's all Hailey, Hailey, Hailey . . . O Hailey!!!  Then there's Russ, his high-school-age stepson, who's also grieving in his own (more understandable way) by acting out, etc.  Then there's Claire, Doug's suddenly unhappily married twin sister and Debbie, his soon-to-be-married younger sister, and their mother, who's constantly drinking wine to numb herself while dealing with her semi-senile doctor husband.  Meanwhile, all kinds of women--married and otherwise--are just pining away for this Doug fellow as though he's all that and a bag of chips.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the story and how it was told, I kept thinking as I read, &#34;This guy and his family don't really have any problems.  It's not like he lost all his children in the crash.&#34;  So, in that regard, it's like &#34;Indecent Proposal,&#34; a good story that could have been amped up with REAL sorrow, like a young auto mechanic who loses his wife and one of his children in a car accident while having to struggle with modest means to raise the two that are left . . . and one of them has cancer.  Now THAT's a guy with some problems.  Doug the widower, not so much.<br /><br />All that being said, it's a good book.said, it's a good book.
1451695195|4.0|(1) This book clearly shows the obvious that only when you yourself have an \\"extraordinary experience,\\" you, even if you have been a diehard materialist, become a believer of \\"extraordinary facts\\" which almost always lack \\"extraordinary evidences.\\"<br />(2) There are numerous examples of NDE (near death experience), as the author has studied previous examples after his own NDE experience. Unfortunately, these experiences are intrinsically of \\"Subjective\\" nature, and hence, as we have seen, are always rejected by \\"Objective\\" science, despite the author's explanation based on the \\"Objective\\" recordings of his brain activity during his coma of almost one week.<br />(3) If, however, NDE were accepted as a scientific fact, then it would mean that science accepts some version of the so-called notorious \\"Dualism\\" initiated by Descartes. John R. Searle, Professor of philosophy at the UCB, writes in his book The Mystery of Consciousness (1997) as follows to reject any versions of \\"dualism\\":<br />... But dualism seems out of the question. To accept dualism is to deny the scientific worldview that we have painfully achieved over the past several centuries. To accept dualism is to conclude that we really live in two quite different worlds, a mental and a physical world, or at the very least that there are two different kinds of properties, mental and physical. ... (pp. 194-195).<br />(4) Recently I read the book \\"Quantum Enigma - Physics encounters consciousness\\" by the physicists Bruce Rosenblum & Fred Kuttner (2012/ 2nd Ed.). I posted my critical review of the book, in which I wrote (& also copied the following in my review of Searle's book):<br />\\"In my view I am very much sure that a form of dualism would be verified sooner or later in some \\"physical experiments.\\" I speculated it in a paper published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 24, No.1, pp. 5 - 39, 2010: Rebuttal to claimed refutations of Duncan MacDougall's experiment on human weight change at the moment of death,\\" (which is available from amazon.com).<br />(5) In my view, some \\"Objective\\" physics experiments should be conducted to show that our physical dimension is not a closed system but open to some non-physical dimensions, regardless of their being called a \\"Heaven\\" or a world for Afterlife &c. And this is what I speculated in the paper mentioned in (4). And this kind of physics experiments definitely helps in judging whether or not the author's claim is correct.
B008AUGEFC|4.0|I read this book because of the movie--which, as of this writing, I have not yet seen--and because of the Wachowski brothers, whose film's I generally like and appreciate.  When I found out the film was based on a novel, I decided to give it a go.<br /><br />The book took me a while to read for several reasons.  First, it tells six different stories over a period of several hundred years (or more), starting with the &#34;Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing&#34; in the 1800s and ending with &#34;Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After&#34; in the distant future.  Each story is told in a different style, so there is some mental gear-shifting involved, sort of like reading Thomas More's &#34;Utopia&#34; followed by Henry Fielding's &#34;Tom Jones&#34; then by Raymond Chandler's &#34;The Big Sleep&#34; then by Kinglsey Amis's &#34;The Green Man&#34; then by Aldous Huxley's &#34;Brave New World&#34; then by Russell Hoban's &#34;Riddley Walker.&#34;  Note that the stories--except for the sixth--are split, such that story 1 (&#34;...Adam Ewing&#34;) appears first, but ends last.  It's like six stories were opened to their respective middles, set atop one another (story 1 on the bottom, story 6 on top) and then formed into one book you read from front to back.<br /><br />Second, while you're reading, you're trying to figure out how story one is connected to story two, etc., so there's an effort involved with that.<br /><br />Third, the sixth story (&#34;Sloosha's ...)--which is told in its entirety in the center of &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34;--is tough going due to the aforementioned &#34;Riddley Walker&#34;-like style.  That story, mind you, isn't bad, just hard to get through.<br /><br />Once, however, you've gotten through &#34;Sloosha's,&#34; you are hungry to read the second halves of stories 1 through 5 because they all end in cliffhanger's in the first half of &#34;Cloud Atlas.&#34;  And, I must say, it seems that in the telling of the first five halves and the whole sixth, the course of the stories themselves (and human history) is somehow changed, for the first halves &#34;terminate&#34; rather negatively, as though dire things will occur.  But these halves seem to influence each other (backward through time) such that the stories ultimately end on a positive note.  Read &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34; and see for yourself.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad I read it and glad I finished it.  Recommended.course of the stories themselves (and human history) is somehow changed, for the first halves &#34;terminate&#34; rather negatively, as though dire things will occur.

B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It's like Super Mario Bros. but less challenging. My kids can play without getting too frustrated. Also fun for casual gameplay.
B003KRJNBW|3.0|The setting of this movie is post-apocalyptic America, 31 years after &#34;the Flash&#34; (a catastrophic event).  The first ten or so minutes show us Denzel Washington as Eli, traveling alone and hunting through a bleak, gray wasteland, carrying the world's last Bible westward to safety based on a message from God.  And those first ten or so minutes show how fascinating movies can be with little or no dialogue (or, in this case, monologue).  As the story progresses, Eli encounters various jittery roadside bandits, who capture, kill and eat passersby . . . unless that passerby is Eli, of course, who has lightning-like reflexes and is handy with bows and arrows, machetes and guns.<br /><br />Roughly an hour into the movie, Eli comes upon a fairly well-established town run by Carnegie (actor Gary Oldman) and his henchmen, led by the &#34;Rome&#34; series' Ray Stevenson.  Carnegie is looking for the very book that Eli is carrying, for Carnegie recalls its power to sway men, et cetera et cetera et cetera.  While the story still has quite a bit of steam going at this point, it does turn into a bit of standard one-man-versus-many action fare with a few unexplained plot holes I won't explore here.  Nevertheless, I good adventure with two (yes TWO) interesting surprises at the end.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love this game. It is so much fun. I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed. Well worth the money.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a novel that really speaks to the point in time at which we find ourselves- the increasing capabilities of technology at war with, but also enabling, our love of the classic, our respect for ancient thinking and our nostalgia for the tangible. This appeals, very sweetly, to the inner geek in all of us, but I do wonder if it will resonate in the same way with those who came before Gen X.
0545265355|5.0|I don't read a lot of fantasy or science fiction like I used to... since Michael Chrichton passed away, and typically only read John Grisham now, but my wife convinced me to read these and I'm totally happy I did.  Now I can't wait for the rest of the movies to come out.
B007SGM084|5.0|almost finished very interesting read and charactersaccessed t immediately and have had no problems with other books either or getting accessories
B00867GHS8|5.0|The 3D effects are subtle enough to not give you a headache and the story is really fun.  I've loved Nemo since it came out and will continue to watch it even after my kids stop.
1881273156|5.0|I read this book before my wedding and it was definately a great insight in how people express their love differently.
0439023513|5.0|Given as a gift to one of the kids.  They loved it !!!  It got here quickly and was the hardbound edition.
B00633W614|4.0|Again the author has completed a rousing intrigue. I have again been drawn into this family's harrowing life cycle of events. I cannot wait for the next chapters/book in this series.
0439023491|5.0|Given as a gift to one of the kids.  They loved it !!!  It got here quickly and was the hardbound edition.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|THIS PRODUCT DID NOT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS  AND THEREFORE I WILL BE REMOVING IT FROM MY DEVICE FOR GOOD PERIOD.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|This is a great movie.  The flow of the story is great, and 2 hours go by before you know it!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Well written and fast paced. I was skeptical about the ghost writer.... is tom clancy even writing books theses days?
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My kids and I saw this at the theater and they just had to have it when it came out!  We watch it at least once a week!  It's cute and funny! and keeps their attention!
B0064T6LV8|3.0|this app is ok but it is a little bit boring. good for small children. not for most adults. its okay.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|New story and very dark.  Wife and I both enjoyed it. Wasn't too long (1:36).  The main downer for me was the &#34;Kill Bill&#34; style blood.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This task killer is very good. I like it because you can decide for yourself what you want to kill and what you dont.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Very fun for down time or if you are bored would be cute for a little girl to play with
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Merida (Kelly MacDonald) is a princess that just wants adventure and excitement. Her mother the Queen however, is forcing Merida to marry whoever wins the competition for her heart. Which makes Merida mad enough to get a magic pastry from a witch in the forrest that she feeds to her mom to change her fate. The Queen is turned into a bear and the two bond when Merida protects her mom from her bear killing father.<br />  Brave is a Disney film that has a Princess that doesn't care about love which hasn't been done by them before. But that doesn't mean it deserved an Oscar due to that. I think Tangled was a better animated comedy by Disney and that wasn't even nominated. Looking at the trailer for Brave, I expected a stronger film from Pixar that we just didn't get. The film is funny and has a touching ending but compared to Wall-E, Up, Finding Nemo, the Incredibles and Toy Story, Brave is one of Pixar's weaker movies.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|This is a very welcome departure from her usual, more mature and down to earth. I love that the song isn't all about sex, crazy high notes and runs. Just a good song with a good message sung by a very talented voice. More like this in the future Mariah!
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|One of the best albums I've bought. Ellie Goulding Has such a lovely voice. Anything could happen is one of the best songs on this album. Fell in Love with her music.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Love this app.It really executes all of the material well. It is so addictive to play. I would recommend this app to anyone. :-)
0061992860|5.0|I found the information online very helpful in understand the product. This is a great investment and really does not cost to much.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|MJ's Moonwalk arrived next day delivery. I was watching it that afternoon, I thought it was great. I had read some one's review on Amazons about Moonwalker and liked what she had wrote about it. So, I wanted to thank her, she nailed it! If you are a fan of MJ's and do not have Moonwalker in your collection, you need to add it. Thanks again.
B005N09L5C|5.0|Orwell was only off by decade or so. Yet everyone thought he was crazy, maybe had he put drones in the book people would wake up. My only fear, is so many people are unaware that this is reality, not fantasy anymore. Guess that's how the ministry of thought aka &#34;Mainstream Media&#34; wants it.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|The how, where, when and why the magic happened.<br /><br />The number of great sounding tracks from that one studio is unbelievable!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is the best game I've played so far. Had problem downloading at first (large file) but once I made room no problem just takes long time to download. Highly. recommend. I do love a challenge, must go find another one
B002APU580|5.0|My favorite movie of all time.  I love Kiera Sedgewich and her co-host Matthew Mcfaden.  They are a good combination!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love the challange that it brings and how quick your coins add up. But I gad recently purchased the zombie girl and had her for a few days and now all my progress is gone but coins stayed the same. So frustrated.
B009369Z8A|5.0|This is a really great movie. it took place back in the'olden' days. My Husband loves Tom Hardy & it was a good movie
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I am a huge SCi Fi fan and this book was so awesome I read it in four hours.  A must have for your SCI Fi collection
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for my 6 year old... she loves playing with her hrse!  It keeps her occupied and quiet when she gets restless at restaurants.  Highly recommend for those with kids.
0345525558|5.0|The author made you feel like you were the one choosing what the flowers said.  I gave great insight as to the nature of the past use of flowers for sending messages.  This was a joy to read.
0143039431|5.0|Never read it as a kid, kinda glad because so much would have been lost on an adolescent mind. As a &#34;seasoned&#34; adult, I can see Steinbeck's political viewpoint come through in a way I would not have been aware of had I read it 30 -40 ago. My business partner, at 72 was born and raised in rural Oklahoma, and having recently read it as well, said that's really how they talked in those parts.<br /><br />Very educational, and what an ending!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Greats Hits CD -  Love Kelly Clarkson's songs. Would definately recommend this CD. If you are not a fan... you will be.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This cd is amazing. Fun. does not disappoint and every song is fantastic on this album. It is very hard to choose a favorite song because everything is great!
B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|It's probably my fault for expecting too much from this film, now it has an Oscar and I don't get it. Somehow Affleck managed to make amazing fact look like mediocre fantasy. The suspense was so labored it was distracting, a bus driver at the airport has trouble getting the bus in gear at just the right, dramatic moment? Really? Mostly I was disappointed that at the end I didn't even care whether the 6 got out or not, they seemed like a bunch of whiney, argumentative children. I bet during the real event they would have done ANYTHING to get out of Iran by time brilliant, earnest Ben showed up. His &#34;heart-tugging&#34; marital problems felt contrived and tacked on, designed to make us care more about him - but I needed to care about the desperate people trying to get back home, and bottom-line, I didn't. Not a terrible film, but not Oscar caliber either.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|This is such a great cd. Many different songs and sounds and it is fantastic! Nate has an amazing voice and it shows on this album!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|If anyone has seen the original cast, this is it for you! Brings back a huge case of nostalgia of Kristen and Idina.
1608862801|5.0|My 11 year old & 13 year old daughter's are both very into Adventure Time. My 11yr old not so much into reading, so I knew she'd love this graphic novel because she loves comics and when she does read chapter books she definitely likes them to have pictures. This book is really bright and colorful, full of Adventure Time art along with the graphic novel. Without counting pages I'd say about 1/3 of this book at the end is full of Adventure Time artwork along with a cover gallery. Which is nice for kids who love to look at the pictures and also draw. The book is 6 1/2&#34; X 10&#34; in size. I think my daughter will love it and anyone who is into Adventure Time.
0547848412|4.0|This is quite the read. I've been meaning to read it for awhile, and is chock full of emotion and storytelling that you'll really feel involved. I highly recommend this to anyone trying to decide whether to read this, and can say that you will enjoy it and possibly come out with a better philosophy on life, because this book also deeply explores what it means to be human, in more ways than one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend who said it is the kind of book you can't put down. She was right. Kept my interest with all the twists and turns.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is an excellent movie with fantastic acting.  Lets one know that life isn't over till its over!<br />Loved it.
B0025KW29U|5.0|A house fire consumed my DVD library, but this is the only disk I replaced. In the steaming era, few films are worth owning for repeat enjoyment of the extras, but this is.
B000002VSN|5.0|I had this soundtrack before and lost it. I love Whitney's voice and I love how in every song I feel hear love for our heavenly father.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|My $30 gamble paid off on this film. It has vastly more visual, dramatic, and narrative value than implied by its disasterous marketing. I took a chance that the trailers had  misrepresented the film. (In fact, I bought it mostly so that I could test out the 3D playback on my Sony/PS3 system with a movie I hadn't caught before). Amazingly, the trailers that promoted JC's original release contained the *dullest frames* of the entire picture - making it appear to be a CGI snoozefest like Transformers. In fact, there is very little of that in this film; while CGI is a massive component, it it used to realize a distinct vision. I'm hoping to see a different world/reality than anything I've seen before when I watch a Fantasy film; ideally, one which is beautiful to look at. And this is what I got out of this film. It drew me in. It feels as though there's more to this world than the backdrop of an expensive beat 'em up. Anyway, this film is great to look at & is a surprisingly entertaining way to spend two and a half hours, but remains an unsung sleeper and not a blockbuster. It's not a five star success because: (a) it is played straight, throughout... this is Flash Gordon without the camp, and (b) the heroes are substantially less interesting that the antagonists (Mark Strong & Dominic West). On the other hand, these uncomplicated/unrelatable heroes are set against non-CGI villains - one reason that this is a lot more fun than something like Cowboys & Aliens.
B0060RZF3Y|5.0|I have to say that I love the Polly Pocket sets but I dislike the options of what to do with all those tiny little pieces that come with it aside from using a gallon-size tacky-looking Zip-Lock plastic bag.  I bought the Polly Pockets case and that sucked.  So I thought I'd mention this Mesh Pencil case sold here on Amazon.  Here is the link:  [[ASIN:B005FIDS5Q Mesh Pencil Case PC-804 AD Design - Color May Very]].  I bought this case (and asked the seller to send me pink...and they did!) and it fits all the items that come in this Polly Pockets set.  Since I fly a lot with my daugher (who is almost 5), I have found that this pencil case fits about 4 to 5 Polly Pockets dolls with accompanying accessories (including these umbrellas, as found in this set) and the case fits perfectly in her backpack with no problems.  The mesh holds everything in perfectly without even the smallest pieces falling out yet you can see most of the items through the case since it's mesh material.  Just an idea if you're finding it frustrating to find solutions to hold all the Polly Pockets \\"stuff.\\"  I hope that helps you since I've found keeping all this Polly Pockets crap together as being quite frustrating to say the least.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great for the horse lover in everyone. my daughter plays all the time. great for car rides to keep her busy
B006LSZECO|1.0|Nick is the cheating husband and Amy is the psycho princess and one of them should die. Unfortunately neither one dies and the author decided to write a \\"psychological thriller\\" and it just wasn't very thrilling or psychological to me. The book is written by flip-flopping between Amy and Nick narratives; after a few chapters I was truly tired of the format. I always finish what I start so I read the whole book. There was no big ending and no triumph of good over evil or evil over good (it sometimes happens). It was like someone slowly letting the air out of a tire - eventually the air's just gone kinda like the title.<br /><br />I'm an avid reader of mysteries and I read at least a book a week and I have to try different authors. This one didn't work for me.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|Omg. this game is so awesome. it is also very very addictive. one you pick it up and start playing it you wont be able to stop and put it down. :)
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Well-written, well-thought out but suffers from sameness with other of the books in the series; when all said and done the story is quite improbable.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|WITH CASKETTS AS AN ADDED PART TO THIS SEASON, GREAT ACTING BY ALL THE CAST, , THE FACIAL EXPRESSION ON STANA'S FACE ARE WORTH NOTICING.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use evernote all the time from my computer, from my android, and from my kindle fire. I'm a student and all of my teachers upload their notes and worksheets and its do incredibly useful for me to collect them all and organize them in evernote.<br /><br />The ONLY reason that this review is a 4 and not a 5 is that I wish it had a better way to embed pdf and PowerPoint files for mobile devices, especially so I could use Skitch on my handouts.
B00881VLCE|4.0|It's neat that you only get more pieces as you place the first ones. I do wish there was an option to do more than 215 pieces. 400-500 would be cool.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I enjoyed the latest 007 including the openingg graphocs amd soundtrack. the movie itself was much darker, less playful than the past.
B004GXHOGK|5.0|I have a fox collection , and I was thrilled when this little guy came along.  It's well-made, detailed right down to the pads on his feet.  He has a nice face and is very nicely colored, as well as being quite sturdy.
B001HN69B8|5.0|heath ledger's last movie. love the fact that all these great actors came together to finish this great movie due to the untimely death of ledger.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 6year old enjoys completing the tasks to care for her horse. Be warned- to get the fun stuff for your horse you will almost have to buy more &quot;gems&quot; but there is still fun to be had without purchasing the extras.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Another wonderful book from nicholas sparks!! He definitely knows how to write a good love story and it's easy to relate to.
B008LD09LS|5.0|Had trouble getting video onto Flash Drive but will figure it out.  Very fun to fly this thing!  Nice Drone!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Five stars. The third installment  in the Mortal instruments series is a wonderful thriller and rollercoaster of a book with twists and turns in every way lies, suspense, drama and corruption can go. This book is hands down one of the best book in the series yet. Jace will question who he is and loyalties will be tested. Are jace and clary really who they think they are or are they apart of a bigger plan that involves the Angle himself? Read City Of Glass and find out what will happen next.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the last in this series and just as good as the first. I could hardly put it down. Sad that it is the last one. I would recommend it to everyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing!!! The graphics are outstanding for being on a tablet! This game is very addicting and fun! And the best part about it is that it was free!!:)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is nice to take care and have a horse again. I miss my real one. Playing this app reminds me of my horse I used to have and that is one reason why I love it so much. Another reason is because it keeps me company when I am in the bathroom or in my bed. or even just relaxing after a hard working day.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Came just like a DVD you would buy in a store. Not bad if you don't mind waiting a week to watch. :)
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this app!  Easy to use! Versatile! Love that I can choose any of my music or a combo of songs for my alarm sound!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game. It has been a lot of fun with challenges along the way. I would recomened this to anyone that wants to Yvette up close and personal with a horse game. It's almost realistic
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|It was a brave attempt to keep the Bond franchise relevant.  They downplayed the gadgets and the babes, which needed to be done, but with that gone there's not much left.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not up to the standards of some of his other books.  Tedious and difficult at times. A good plot but hard to follow.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I use this with my IPhone in a motorcycle helmet with Giro tuneups helmet  speakers, makes a great system for relatively cheap.
0345529057|5.0|Price was great. This is a wonderful set of book with great character development. I have only read two of them thus far and am looking forward to the next two volumes. Totally enthralled with them. Like the Harry Potter books I have a hard time putting them down but at 900 pages each there is no way I can read one in a single sitting. Wish I  could.
1419705849|5.0|Grand-daughter likes these books. Very simple information and in comic type reading, children like this type book and relate, Title not very good for children
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Expect not to get any answer that shows right in front of you.  But as you read it, it is up to the introvert to find that answer for him/herself.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was such an entertaining read!!! I love the fact that Travis was so persistent on getting to know Abby. They are the cutest couple!!!!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|First two books I counld not put it down.  But then 3 and 4 just got way too long and led to nowhere it seems.  You keep asking yourself...and then.  Personally I like some closure.  I feel like along the way the author's is more trying to drag on for commercial sake versus being true to writing for the reader.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|use this everyday! love the variety of sounds! and the timer feature make is nice to not drain the battery on the kindle
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Quick download and very clear picture. As good as Nutflix. Just found out about this service from Amazon and really like it.
1455508977|5.0|I always love Nicholas Sparks books! I'm never disappointed, and this was no different. I believe any fan of Nicholas Sparks will love this book.
0486266885|5.0|I, of course, had heard of the story. The book was mentioned in Ken Roberts book \\"A rich man's secret\\" as a reinforcement of what he mentioned about \\"Thoughts\\". The book is a little difficult to read as it is written in an old British style; Not like Shakespeare, but old  expressions. But I stuck to it and didn't regret. The story is of course a suspense, but it unveils the duality of every human being, meaning the good and the bad sides, and making a choice as to whether we wish to develop our Higher Self, or Lower Self. Great!
0446547646|5.0|I am never disappointed with a Nicholas Sparks book! They are always a great read, and this one definitely lived up to expectations as well.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|For all those as disappointed as me that this did not include all the songs this is what I found on wikipedia, &#34;On 25 January 2013, Republic Records confirmed via Twitter that a deluxe soundtrack is in production with a target release date alongside the DVD and Blu-ray.&#34; Yay! There is hope!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We ordered these as Christmas presents for some of the kids in our family, and they all really enjoyed this movie. And, I have to admit, I think it's a new favorite Disney movie for me, too.
B0014EVO4M|5.0|When music can give you goosebumps....its got to be good.  I could put this on repeat for a month, plus.  Great campfire music.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I am very satisfied with the product, it came in a good time and the customer service provided was great.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I had almost given up on Deftones but they came through HUGE.  This album will be enjoyed by everyone from pure metal heads to alt. rock fans.
B004SN8YXK|5.0|I use these to squat and for running springs fits great no complaints at all. Only problem is that they fit too snug if I wear thick socks but thats on me probably should have gone a 1/2 size larger

B00746O3X8|5.0|I shoot with a D800 & D5100 and this harness system handles things just fine.  The only problem is when I use my flash mounting bracket and 910 strobe - all that puts the weight too far out to comfortably holster the rig, but I still use the security strap and the side holster for the D5100, and after the \\"before ceremony\\" shots are done, I remove the flash bracket anyway.  I can't imagine wanting to cover an event with two cameras and not use this harness.
1616550414|5.0|I cannot describe how ecstatic I was when this arrived in the mail. I've been an avid Zelda fan since I was 12 years old (I'm 19 right now) and have played every game. As soon as Nintendo announced that they would release this, I knew I just HAD to buy it. It is everything I had hoped for. It is quite heavy but beautifully bound together and looks like an anthology. People complain that the cover is ugly but I honestly don't see what's wrong with it... It's exactly what the picture is. The book contains beautiful concept arts and never-before-seen artwork of unused enemies, levels, etc. from various games. I do admit the book does contain a huge chunk on Skyward Sword, but since that's the most recent game I guess that's to be expected. The first chapter is pretty much on that game. The chronology of the Zelda game follows and then afterwards there is a lot of in-depth description about every Zelda game created, even rare ones. There's a lot of concept art for every game as well, as well as a timeline of how Link has changed from the original NES title to Skyward Sword (the same goes for Zelda and Ganondorf). At the end of the book, there is a manga about Skyward Sword. However, you must read it from the back to the front like the traditional Japanese manga.<br /><br />All in all, I honestly believe this was a great investment. It's a LOT cheaper here on Amazon compared to other sites, especially in stores, so I think you should get it on here (especially if you have Amazon Prime). My boyfriend and I love the series and I cried tears just going through this book. Greatest creation ever.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|Bought this just before Christmas and love the energy of this intimate club setting. Joe Bonamassa up close and personal!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a story told from two different viewpoints. If you've read a lot of suspense fiction you think you know what's going to come next. It never does work out the way that you think it will. This is a timely story about a wife that goes missing. It seems ripped from the headlines of today. i expected to see Nancy Grace doing a piece on this. Ah, but there are so many delicious twists in this book. This a a masterful author. I would put this in my top five books that I've read in the last five years.
B0040N5364|4.0|I can't believe these digitally remastered classics are available for less than $5! Listening to Meat is Murder brings back many great memories.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I read and read and read this. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a post apcolytic novel. This kind of make me want to take out my eyes and scrub them clean after reading and reading and, did I mention reading this for a long time. Not a quick read, not something that I feel like finishing.
0761171703|5.0|I bought this book for my mother and grandmother and I to share as a Christmas / Birthday gift. I hoped it would prove inspirational - and I was right! Everyone loved looking at all of the gorgeous and amazing photos. This book is stunningly beautiful and makes you want to jump up and dance.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I think that this more appeals to females. As a male I just don't get the thing of hurting yourself (cutting or otherwise). Now doing something that will probably result in injury, pain and maybe some cool scars on a dare or to impress girls - that I understand. Having gotten over the cultural issue of cutting, this is a good suspense story set in a small southern city with many of the things that makes the south, well southern. There is the sense of place and status, the line between the privilaged, and not so. The things not said, and the sniping that goes along with it. I enjoyed this and would recommend it.
B007ZZ3RI0|5.0|Adam Lambert at his bouncy, crooning, seductive best. Great music to play whilst cleaning, mopping, doing dishes, etc. Crank the speakers up and bounce around. Makes cleaning much more fun.
0979019710|5.0|I just finished reading The Miracle Morning and have ordered my Miracle Morning Journal.  Since reading this book, I have been waking up 30 minutes earlier than I used to and I don't hit the snooze button four times anymore.  I spend the time preparing for my day and getting a good start.  I love how this carries through the rest of my day.  I have become much more productive and stay focused on my highest priority goals because I've already planned out my day.  This is a great book to read to set yourself apart from the majority of the public if you are committed to becoming the person you know you can be and reaching your full potential.  There are simple steps you can take that are explained in the book that give you a huge advantage in reaching your goals and living the life you want to live.
B008FLYM50|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this CD. Fabulous! I play it on repeat whilst cleaning my house. It's nice and bouncy - good cleaning music.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love, love, looovvvee, reading this book. Personally I think it's the best book out of the trilogy. This is the 4th time I've read this on.
B003NDC07M|5.0|Marina's songs get stuck in your head so! This CD is also good for cleaning. And just like Electra Heart - not one song that is 'not up to snuff.'
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have played and enjoyed both \\"Quell\\" games and would like to see more like this game. This is my first review because I feel the developers deserve a good one.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|It didn't download well and any time we try to watch it, it will stop every 5 min. to reload.  Quality would only play at 1 star, when it would play.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|Focused too much on action and violence and not enough on what could have been a good science fiction story. Too bad.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very sweet love story but at the same time it was an edge-of-your-seat thriller all in one.  Just saw the movie which differed quite a bit from the book but both were equally satisfying.
0375851569|5.0|I loved these books when I was a kid so bought them for my son when he was a baby.  Unfortunately, I lost them in a flood a few years ago.  I bought this collection for my son who is now starting to read.  He loves the books!  I chose standard shipping but received the package ahead of the ETA.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|I am very partial to this movie. I like it better than the original! I watched it several times this Christmas season.
B00B2EWNWG|5.0|It is a touch difficult to get into in the beginning, but once Russell Crowe is in the picture and Lucy Lu it because great fun! WE support any Tarantino film
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just wow...talk about an unconditional love story. (From all aspects) This book was amazing. I think everyone would enjoy this book.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Such a good read. Keeps you on the edge of your seat i really recommend the other two books as well.
6304936362|5.0|This has got to be the best WWll B17 Flying Fortress movie ever made.  And being now on DVD it is preserved for a long time.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|The movie is one of my favorites to date. The condition and play of this movie was wonderful and there was no skips in this movie. I would recommend this movie to anybody that is a fan of the Final Fantasy series to watch it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|gghgggg its amazing i love horses and i really have no clue what else to say otber than that i luv it
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is fun when you're bored with nothing else to do, but it can be very aggravating, so I don't recommend playing this game for long periods of time.  A little of this game goes a long way.
1439152802|5.0|This book is highly rated.....and for good reason.  Kate Morton is brilliant.  She writes like she is weaving an intricate tapestry.  It is up to you, the reader, to see the patterns and create the big picture.  I am not in a book club, but I often discuss books read with a good friend who enjoys similar genre.  We both loved the book, and picked up tiny details that each other missed, and had to go back and read sections of the book to re-draw conclusions.  Fantastic storyline and amazing book!  Looking forward to future books from Kate Morton.  Now I highly recommend this book as well!  :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is a real page-turner with surprising twists.  It is well-written, and the characters are interesting. The reader will wonder what will happen to them next.
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|I like it . Though the first  disk has some issues before it  starts  with the first episode. Other then that it's in good shape.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|wanted something comparable to bubble island and thought this would be like it but not up to par for me
0345529057|5.0|I got theses as a gift for my mother-in-law  for the holidays and she is really loving  them .Thanks .
B004Y042N8|5.0|This puzzle game helps keep my brain sharp when I am just sitting around being bored. Tricky but not too tricky that I get frustrated and want to quit.
B0063IH60K|1.0|This game was free and it still wasn't worth it.  the constant pop up are annoying.<br /><br />  some  or most are very suggestive. I removed from my Kindle.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|Although the stars are really showing their age, this was a very good action movie.  Most of the movie was suspensful.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is fun, but still far off from the real thing. I have my own horse and she's way better. This game needs a reality update that includes foals!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like how it can be made easy for kids or harder for adults. I dont like the &quot;romantic&quot; puzzle pics. The baby and castles and Paris ones are good though.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey continues the story begun last season. The ending was a typical British shocker. And it leaves you in suspense waiting for the next season.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Great price! Really an enjoyable concert. It is a pleasure to hear such great licks from the guitar. Highly recommend.
0525478817|4.0|I cried and cried and cried. I felt bad for two days. What a beautiful book, using literary criteria and everything else. The emotional impact is absolutely wrenching. Yes, I recommend this book absolutely, but it won't do for everybody.<br /><br />Later, I found myself wishing incurable cancer could always cause people to be this romantic and brave. Alas, no. Regrettably, I've 'witnessed' several deaths, and I've become familiar with the unpredictability of how people come apart faced with slow-motion dying. However, the central issue of children dying of cancer is heartbreaking, and the power of this book is that it doesn't sugar coat the emotional costs of dying children. Hazel and Augustus are incredibly lovable and their struggle to find a way to live with cancer in minimum darkness is truly affecting and amazingly real.<br /><br />This is a romantic book of wit and strength, with few hard edges despite there being no miracles or reprieves, but it is difficult to put down regardless. Even with the knowing that these kids have incurable cancer, they have a quest to meet an author who lives in Amsterdam, and they scheme on ways to meet him that would take months to bring to fruition. We don't know if they get their wish for a long time. It drives the book forward keeping the reader on high tension. The day-to-day events are also completely engrossing as they reflect on the literal life and death possibility of each day being their last while they begin and grow their relationship. The trip to Anne Frank's house was very moving and satisfying, even while the obvious comparisons between Anne's life and our contemporary doomed teens was being made.<br /><br />As most reviewers notice, the book is not, perhaps, 'GREAT', but it is 'great',  in my opinion. The only thing I noticed too much was the overly clean purity of the novel's structure. The fix is in: Hazel and Augustus are perfect, their parents are perfect, their wit is perfect, the progression of events is perfect. It is difficult to not be aware of being manipulated. It is the 'Bambi' Disney movie about death by cancer - although albeit bleak, no happy endings, but very realistically positive, anyway. Whether people loved it or hated it, most of us noticed this somewhat airbrushed quality, which seems to be the stony beach people either can skip over and enjoy swimming in the water - or not. I think it should be said at this point that this is a Teen Read, which SHOULD be a mild sauce novel. It's not a Harlequin, but it's not a gritty noir. It is definitely not for everyone, though. It's not a five tissue read - its a using-up-every-tissue-in-the-house and having red, puffy eyes for a day read.fect. It is difficult to not be aware of being manipulated.

B003VPWX6K|5.0|Quiet and beautiful, with all the emotion and humor bubbling just below the surface, waiting to reward those who listen closely and patiently.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great storyline, great cast, and amazing character development for such complicated cast.  Bravo!  Can't wait to see what is coming for Season 4.  This is definitely worth owning.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Recommend for adult audience. Excellent treatment on a tough subject. Readers will be introduced to a realistic troubled teenage world.
0525425764|5.0|It was another non stop read. Have read every book he his written as always this was another great book.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Stunning cinematograpy, action packed thrills and of course beautiful women.  highly recommend to anyone looking for a good movie to watch.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This game is great, at least for a demo. When your time is up, you can always make another world. Other people have been complaining about the time limit. I think that the amount of time given is long enough, because it is a demo. Everybody is rating this demo based on the time limit, not the game. The game itself is great.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Stunning cinematograpy, action packed thrills and lots of mystery.  highly recommend to anyone looking for a good movie to watch.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I wish I could go see her in concert but this was the next best thing.<br />Fabulous.<br />I was singing along for all of the songs.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the best game ever I love the new updates please keep updating it this is also the scariest game ever love the animation thank you for making this I'm addicted to this now thank you
B0018QOIXU|5.0|What a voice.<br />What can I say that has not been said already.<br />You will not be disappointed.<br />Awesome.<br />Brilliant.<br />Great from the first track to the last.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Proof that you don't need nudity, sex or profane language to have a great show!  Elegant and refined with a great story line.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Although there's some license historically, the actors do a great job, the technology is accurate, and the cinematography is amazing
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought this book really captured the teen angst. Loved all of the characters and I wish I could find put how Charlie is doing
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read every book in the Jack Reacher series and will continue to read them. Thoroughly entertaining and hard to put down.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|I thought I would like this, but find after one episode that it troubled me too much.  There is enough real violence in the world.  Sorry I bought it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I'm obsessed with this game. It has a lot of free puzzles you can build. I play it all the time and always want to play it ha ha.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Good game, not done yet but working great on my Samsung galaxy.  Fun game, not too hard but keeps your attention.  Objects are well hidden.  Easy to navigate around.  Good game to play with my grand daughter.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Great movie. Would recommend. Would have given five stars if they had shown how prisoner escaped.  Unless I missed something and was supposed to figure out on my own how it was done.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Nice to see adventures of some of the other characters in this saga.  Enjoyable and had a good flow from beginning to end.  Also liked the mini-flashbacks to previous novels.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is the best zombie movie ever. Now with all the behind the scenes, extended scenes, deleted scenes, and more. It is an awesome way to experience the best zombie movie. It was a great gift to myself. :)
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I love the series, but felt this season was a bit too eventful in the death department.  Very sad ending.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is AWESOME as soon as I got a Kindle fire I knew I had to buy this game. Getting the $0.99 one is worth it I have only seen one game getting advertised and it rarely comes up. I like that every once in a while the game makers make a new level. I am very pleased with this game and if I could I would give it more than a 5 star
B005IFWXWU|5.0|I saw a PBS special with Hugh Laurie and his love of blues and jazz  I was sold then.  Very happy to see he has a CD.  Hope there will be more.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This book absolutely amazing! Definitely read the book first before watching the movie. The movie felt like it was going by fast, then again it is a movie. But it follows the book very well!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Lots of twists to the plot. Plenty of characters to keep you guessing. I love the atmosphere he uses to describe Scotlands weather and landscape. Puts you in the picture.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|If you are interested in reading about Wall Street traders' booze&sex parties do not read this book. But if you want an ex-bond trader explain the mechanism of mortgage bond crisis in plain English and enjoy his skillful storytelling at the same time - enjoy!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Season two was great as we were kept waiting to see what would happen with Mary and Matthew!  The Christmas episode was elegant and fun!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My kids love all the angry birds games,but this is definitely one of their fav ones to play! They play it all the time.
B0071T4BVC|5.0|This is so different from what I have heard him sing.  It is Paul McCartney unplugged for lack of a better term.
0425252868|5.0|I have read many WWII books, visited battlefields and attended bomb group reunions.  I thought I had a pretty good feel for the air war of WWII.  This book has given me a completely new point of reference from the side of the German pilot.  It was compelling and heart wrenching in its detail. The horrors of the war were felt by good men on both sides.  If you are interested in understanding how the German pilot felt during the war , read this book.  It will change the way you look at the entire story.
B007REV4YI|5.0|my husband thought this was the greatest Valentine's Day present... he was super excited - - fits in his complete James Bond collection case
B008JFUTUY|5.0|This is a truly remarkable story about an artist that never got the break he deserved !!!  Rodriquez is truly a great
B002HFP0R4|4.0|I bought this 4-CD set recently , and I can certainly recommend three out of the four CDs to Bee Gees fans.  The first CD , dedicated to Barry Gibb ,  comprises an excellent selection of most  , 'though not all , of the group's biggest hits, while the second and fourth CDs , dedicated to Robin and Andy respectively , provide a welcome opportunity to obtain some of their hard-to-find songs.  The problem , for me anyway , lies in the third CD , dedicated to Maurice.  It has 20 tracks , none of which was a hit , and when you listen to them it's easy to see why ;  in my opinion , they are very poor efforts , 'though I appreciate that they may be of some interest to really dedicated fans.  In conclusion , I would say that this 4-CD set is certainly worth purchasing for three out of the four CDs , but CD no.3 is best ignored !
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My daughter loved this movie,we watched it for a mommy daughter time and it was so cute!!!! Loved that you have the rental for 48hours that is really nice!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I downloaded this app at home and then went to church thinking I would be all set. WRONG. This app only works when connected to the internet (my church doesn't have Wifi). I also couldn't find the setting to change the bible styles so I'm stuck in the New King James. I like to do my quiet time on the go (not to mention in NIV), so this app what NOT what I wanted.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I would recommend it to every reader. Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors and can't wait to read his next masterpiece:)
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|This is a mindless action flick with lots and lots of chasing around.  Acting was limited to groaning out lines in feeble attempts to character act out &#34;toughness&#34; and strength.  The almost complete lack of plot really through me.  The 1982 version was all loaded with plot and a lot less action creating a sense a evil, good, and pleassure.  This 2011 version did not even make much sense let alone create any feeling of good of evil other than as shamelessly spelled out by naming characters &#34;monks&#34; or whatever.  Also, as an epic tale the cast of 30 was just another shortcoming to go with the lost plot.  The 1982 version had hundreds of extras really adding to the image of completeness.  Am sure there are many who would like this version better.  For them I would suggest the recent Mission Impossible (Impossibly ridiculous)  movies by Tom Cruise, bad acting, no plot, and no congruence.  For those who like to become engaged mentally this is definitely not the one to watch.  In this, the hero always wins, the bad guy almost always comes up short.  Actually, the more I think about it the more I think it was a waste of time unless you like the recent Tom Cruise movies then this would be a good choice.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Enjoyed this book.<br />Chris seemed a heck of a guy.<br />So sorry he's gone.<br />War is crazy, but he sure did his part!
B0013D6LEM|5.0|Do I really need to review this album?  If you don't know about this album nothing I say can help you..  This was is and forever will be the best album along with the video ever.  Will never be another Michael Jackson.  Was so blessed to be born at the best time to be able to enjoy his taken first hand.  Love it!
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids love this game! They play it all the time! Never have any problems,no glitches Or nothing with the app!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Could not put this down. Beautifully written story. Anxious to watch the movie. Very surprising ending. Makes me want to read more Nicholas sparks books.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Great book! This is the second book I've read of hers and its my favorite!!!  I was not expecting it to end that way!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is handy to  have on my Kindle fire, to use at various times when I need a calculator of this type...it saves time and energy for those times...I am glad I found it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I was able to have the app for two weeks. I loved the app and was addicted to it. I got my multiplier to times fourteen and then the app erased all the data and made me restart.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|I have always loved this album since it was first released. Every song is great on it!!!  This was one of my all time favorites.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is probably on of my least fav angry birds games ! My kids like it,but me not so much! App works great!
1449410243|3.0|The book overall is pretty funny.  There's some pretty foul language throughout the book so I wouldn't recommend this book if you can't take that kind of thing.
B000002LSV|5.0|Of course this is great!  This is the album with ZZ Top's greatest hits.  All you could ask for for the best road music!
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|The game was ok.  Difficult to control on the kindle fire hd.  Hard to see where you were going with two fingers on the screen.  Game was also short...hoping for more chapters.  The game does have the scare factor going for it.  When I turned around and he was right there, I almost threw my kindle.
B0086700CM|3.0|um I guess it is ok or fine I feel that it is not the greatest game ever but it is not too bad eiether even though I am not the best player ever
B004K8WPUQ|1.0|I own over $300k worth of gear, I have bought everything in the camera lighting grip and audio world you can think of.<br /><br />This mic, without a doubt is in the top 3 WORST pieces of equipment I have ever bought. Anyone who rates this more than 1 star has not actually used it, or is an novice DSLR shooter.<br /><br />The sound is crap, tinny and souless. The mounts are complete joke and break constantly or come undone. Any time a manufacturer sends extra parts (little baggie of extra rubber band mounts) to try to head off complaints, you know you have a piece of dogcrap. The mounts are almost impossible to get back on and they are so thing they barely suspend the mic and break constantly.<br /><br />This thing is built like a cheap Chew toy. Its &#34;dead cat&#34; wind screen is worth about what a dead cat is worth. over all i think the build quality is horrible and a person would be WAY better off buying a proper mic and a 1/4-20 hotshoe adapter with a proper suspension mount.<br /><br />cant believe I spent money on this. Anyone want to buy it?
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I played this game a couple of times and then it froze up and wouldn't do anything! I had to uninstall it!
B008GFI3QE|5.0|This documentary is really great. Like most Beatles fans, the most I knew about George Martin came from watching the Anthology or a book here and there. This documentary really lets you get to know the man behind the Beatles. But he did so much more with his life than produce the Beatles. Not a lot of people know that the band America (Horse With No Name, Sister Golden Hair), George Martin produced several of their albums as well. He's had such a wonderful life, and he's a fascinating man.  If you're a Beatles fan, music fan, audio enthusiast, a human being, or all of the above, this is a wonderful addition to any collection.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|this game is fun to play I enjoy playing this game the only thing I dislike is when I open the next shark and close out for a bit it resets and I have to start over
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|Love David Sedaris for his sarcasm and cynical view of life. It all makes for a great read. Always funny and entertaining.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|DROPS TOO MUCH AND HAVE HAVE TO START OVER. DON'T REALLY LIKE THAT.  NOTHING ELSE TO SAY AT THIS TIME.
B004X80QNG|3.0|Very helpful but with all the updates keeps foreclosing! It gets annoying but it does what it's meant to do and helps keep me organized
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Me and my 8 year old son were playing this game and we got really far on on it and then it froze and wouldn't do anything. We had to uninstall it!!!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Well acted, written and directed.  Even though you knew the finale, it keeps you on the edge of seat and all tensed up.  Great movie!
0823016285|5.0|The book is excelent.  I am captivated!  The artist covers a wide range of human emotions.  This is needful, because every expression of life has its own look.  I love this book and would recomend it to actors as well as artist.
0345525558|5.0|I first read this book from the library, but I loved it so much I am buying a copy to keep and share with friends.  For me, it is one of those books where I am a little sad at the end because I want to stay with the characters - I wasn't ready for the story to end.  Each character is complex and well developed and the story is heart wrenching and yet uplifting.  I am definitely adding this book to my list of favorites!
B0010YPTGU|5.0|This concert is my personal favorite, it takes place in a beautiful valley in Tuscany the DVD includes a behind the scenes and a CD of the concert. 2 for 1 is a great value!
B006BG7RI0|5.0|Amazing edition from one of the best film in the history of movies!!! Limited edition with serial number, don't wast your time, buy it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a pretty good app! Just like the solitaire on the computers!  I play it quite a bit,have never had a problem!
B00867GHS8|4.0|We love this movie, always have. The movie is great, I was hoping for a little more from the 3D experience. The 3D is well done, but nothing that 'blows you away'. Other movies that were produced with 3D in mind are going to give you a better 3D experience.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|My favorite non traditional love story.  I am no fan of romantic comedies.  This love story is unexpected and eye opening.  One person's poison is another person's passion.  This movie perfectly depicts this saying.
B000002UY3|5.0|This is still one of the best albums ever by Mazzy Star and the ghostly sound of Hope Sandoval's voice is hypnotic.  Great mellow music if you feel like relaxing and enjoying.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|New camera and I don't have $600 right now for a macro lens. Have had macro lenses with previous cameras and very much enjoy taking photos of flowers, as my wife is an avid gardener. I've only taken a handful of photos so far with the Raynox, and am having quite a lot of fun with it. With my setup (18-55 on a Fujifilm XE-1) there is a bit of vignetting at the corners, but it's nothing that can't be easily cropped out. The extremely shallow depth of field that is achievable is very very impressive, much more so than my macro lens on my other cameras. This really is a \\"super macro\\" and not really a direct replacement for a conventional macro lens.<br /><br />In an ideal world we'd have infinite money to buy all the toys, but in the world I live in, I have to make choices. I think this is a good choice for experienced photographers who want to do super macro, or newbies that want to have fun with the world of macro photography. Patience will be rewarded.

0385535147|5.0|I really like John Grisham's books.  This one did not fail to impress me.  THE RACKETEER is about a lawyer who is imprisoned for a crime of association and wrong place, wrong time.  There are many characters and the surprise ending brings all of them together in an unusual way.  You have to read carefully to follow all the connections.  You'll like this book.  So much to learn about prison, the FBI, money crimes and how to \\"hide\\" from the law.
1609611543|5.0|I've not only bought this book for myself but for others who I hope do the same for their loved ones.  The Wheat Belly Cookbook also by Dr. Davis is excellent as well.  This is crucial reading for anyone who cares about their health.  It explains how damaging modern wheat and other foods are to us and what you can do about it.  I only follow good scientific fact when it comes taking health advice.  Dr. Davis changed my life.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|First of all, you should read this book. This is a potentially life-changing book. If that does not move you, let's try a different approach. The book is widely known, and it is short. If you read it, next time someone says \\"There is a great book called \\"A Man's Search for Meaning\\", have you read it?\\", you can say \\"Yes! I have read it\\" (because it is short), and then the person you are talking to will think you are a respectable person because the main attribute of the book is not that it is short, but that it is potentially life-changing...

B000RT5XVA|5.0|The last weekend my Centurion II group met with the late Charles Colson he requested we re- read John Steinbeck's classic - The Grapes of Wrath.  I have read more that 150 book Biblical worldview recommend by Chuck Colson and this book is one of my favorites.  I know we all read Steinbeck's classic in high school but I promise you will read it from a far different perspective now.  I fear Chuck asked us to re-read the book as part of his preparing us for some very tough times.<br />I review books by letting the author speak for him/herself.  The paragraph below introduces my favorite character.  She reminds me of my precious mother.<br />\\"...Ma was heavy, but not fat; thick with childbearing and work.  She wore a loose Mother Hubbard of gray cloth in which there had once been colored flowers, but the color was washed out now. So that the small flowered pattern was only a little lighter gray that the background.  The dress came down to her ankles, and her strong, broad, bare feet  moved quickly and deftly over the floor.  Her thin, steel-gray hair was gathered in a sparse wispy knot at the back of her head.  Strong, freckled arms were bare to the elbow, and her hands were chubby and delicate, like those of a plump little girl.  She looked out into the sunshine.  Her face was not soft; it was controlled, kindly.  Her hazel eyes seemed to have experienced all possible tragedy and to have mounted pain and suffering like steps into a high calm and superhuman undertaking.  She seemed to know, to accept, to welcome her position. The citadel of the family, the strong place that could not be taken.  And since old Tom and the children could not know hurt of fear unless she acknowledged hurt and fear, she had practiced denying them in herself.  And since, when a joyful thing happened, they looked to see whether joy was on her, it was her habit to build up laughter out of inadequate family materials.  Imperturbability could be depended upon.  And from her great and humble position in the family she had taken dignity and a clean calm beauty.  From her position as healer, her hands had grown sure and cool and quiet; from her position as arbiter she had become as remote and faultless in judgment as a goddess.  She seemed to know that if she swayed the family shook, and if she ever really deeply wavered or despaired the family would fall, the family will to function would be gone.\\"<br />Grapes of Wrath will bless you.

B002NXOQF2|5.0|Who knew a story about rabbits searching for a home could be so moving, powerful and relatable? I would recommend this to anyone who likes animals. Or just good stories.
0525953728|5.0|I was very happy with the service and pricing.  As far as the box itself...I haven't read it yet.  It was a gift for my husband and I'll get to it after he's read it.
B00881VLCE|2.0|The game is too fast.  It is not player friendly.  You can hardly get the peices in place before it is over.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I finished Hunger Games on February 21, after a more or less all day reading spree. With this book I was more moderate, not because it was less gripping, it was a very fine follow up, and leaves you absolutely breathless for number three. All of our favorite (living) characters are back and if you thought that life couldn't get worse in District 12 it's only because you don't have Suzanne Collins' imagination. I actually took three days to read this book, because I had other commitments with people actually depending on me, otherwise I'd have been happy to read straight through this. I started reading another book on my Kindle so that I would go to sleep at night. If I hadn't, sleep would have been forsaken and I'd have read through to the end. Is the end satisfying? Not exactly. This is very much the second book of a trilogy. Absolutely do not try to read this series out of sequence, it would pretty much ruin the entire experience. And it is an experience. As soon as I finished it I bought Mockingjay (I love the immediate ability to purchase and read afforded by having a Kindle!), and I'm about 1/2 way through that, but I wanted to get my review done while the story is still separate in my mind. While there is some time passing between Hunger Games and Catching Fire the plot flows immediately between Catching Fire and Mockingjay. Sorry, I can't write more now, I have to get back to my book... and I don't even know how I want the trilogy to end.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I am a dedicated amazon shopper,lol! I use this app on a daily basis!! It seems I am always on there finding stuff to buy!!!
B008MEM24S|4.0|My husband and I love this game and play almost everyday. Even though this may be geared towards kids, this game is very adult friendly. This game makes you think as well as gives you a chuckle or two.<br /><br />My first gripe is that the current paid for version did not update to the \\"Where's My Valentine\\" version, which it was suppose to. You have to download the free version of WMV and suffer through the adds.<br /><br />My second gripe is that this game does not update as fast as Apple. My husband already has the \\"Happy Platypus Day\\" update while mine is still sitting there with no update in sight. If the updates were more frequent, this will be 5 stars easily!<br /><br />In all, we love the entire \\"Where's My\\" series! Great games that you can play over and over again!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|An excellent continuation of the storylines in season 1. The acting is amazing, the stories compelling, and the right touch of humor is always there. I enjoy this series and am waiting for the third season with bated breath.
B009AMALGM|5.0|we have all 4 movies and they are all very scary. Hopefully there will be more being made. Can't wait.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the game.  It is one of those games that you have control over the outcome of winning or losing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it and my kids love it. Only thing I don't like are the pop up ads, my kids tend to click on them too fast.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|My sister in law had a Perplexus Rookie for us to play with when I saw her at Christmas.  After 3 tries I had mastered the Rookie and was ready for more of a challenge.  The Epic is just that!  I've been working on solving this puzzel for many hours and have still only managed to get through 80 of the 125 obstacles.  It's very fun but extremely challenging.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Men in Black 3(2012) is a good sequel. Agent J(Will Smith) travels back to the year 1969 to stop Boris The Animal from killing Agent K(Tommy Lee Jones). Josh Brolin played a young Agent K for most of the film. The scenes in 1969 feel like a Mad Men episode. There are some plot holes and the theme song by Pitbull is a little bland. The Men in Black movies have a lighter tone than the Men in Black comic books created by Lowell Cunningham. In the comic books, the Men in Black killed innocent people, fought werewolves, and Agent J was a white, Caucasian man! Men in Black 3 is worth watching with some popcorn, candy, and soft drinks.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|As a fan of the original TV &#34;soap&#34;, I thought this movie brought in the myterious aspects of the show and blended well with being in modern times.  Johnny Depp and Tim Burton are quite a good combination!  I especially loved the portion of the movie where they were restoring the manor and Barnabas is trying to find the perfect place to sleep - it was hilarious!!
B0002DKCMG|5.0|First time I saw it was in Germany with Beer Fest and it rocked! Traveling sometimes is this good! It has a lot of EXTRAS including the famous song of Scotty doesn`t know video!

1607066017|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy this series, but kept hearing so much critical praise I broke down and ordered this trade.<br /><br />Wow. This was awesome, seriously. The moment I completed this book I was online pre-ordering vol. 2!<br /><br />It's sc-fi + fantasy, definitely for a mature audience, but never comes off as crude or cheap. Definitely worth a read!<br />(it's well illustrated too! simply beautiful and imaginative!)<br /><br />Buy it!
0316227706|5.0|I chose this book to get a completely different look at our canine companions.  I loved it!  I also bought a copy for a girlfriend's birthday in April.  She is also a &#34;dog&#34; person.  I highly recommend this book.  Trudy in Glen Burnie, MD.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I will not bother with a synopsis of the book, as one can be found on Amazon and in other reviews. Furthermore, there is very little that can be said about what the book is about without ruining the book. I actually saw the movie first and STILL loved the book. I read it over the course of a couple days and pushed through as I wanted to get to the spectacular twist I remembered from the movie. (If anyone else has both read and seen the movie, which I'm sure you have, did you also find the book to be slightly less shocking than the movie? Or is it only because I saw the film first?)<br /><br />This is the first book I have read by Dennis Lehane and it won't be my last. I just finished my doctorate in psychology, so I imagine the debate on humane psychiatric treatment in the background of this story would be more compelling to me than some. But even without an interest in that, the characters and the way the mystery unfolds are riveting. While not told from first person narrative, the reader is firmly in Teddy Daniels's head and his world is ours, his truth is ours, his doubt is ours. The creepy island setting, the hurricane, the patients themselves all provide a backdrop that adds countless layers to the story. What is real, and who can be trusted?<br /><br />I'm anxious to go watch the film again now and see what changes were made. I recommended this book to family and friends. The ending is truly surprising, astounding, haunting. This book will stay with you long after it is finished.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Really enjoying this game. Easy to pick up and play, and challenging enough to keep me coming back for more almost daily.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|The first few days the app worked good - the further into the game the worse it gets -support is fast to respond-but you should not have to contact them every time you play. I would not recomend it for a Kindly Fire.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My kids love love love this game! They play it all the time,it's by far their fav angry birds game!!!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Every 100th book (and that's even a generous number) comes one like this. Regardless of genre or pure preference, this is a complete piece of literary, storytelling genius. I'm not speechless about many things... but I'm in udder awe of every part of \\"Room\\". The best book I've read this decade.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I simply couldn't wait to get to the end of this trilogy! Each chapter left me wanting more. I was very pleased with the ending and I felt that it had a great sense of closure to it, as any good series should. Looking forward to other books by Suzanne Collins... hopefully she's not a \\"one series\\" author!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book took me a bit too get into, being a tad slow in the beginning but it soon had me hooked. I hope this story continues and we get to find out more back story.

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Shin In Geun was born in a North Korean labor camp. He rarely saw his father or brother and they really didn't have much to do with him. For a time, he lived with his mother and competed with her for food. Shin received most of his early training from prison guards. He was essentially raised by wolves. In 2005, he became the first person born in a North Korean prison camp to escape to the West.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0230754686 Escape from Camp 14]] tells the story of how he made it out, as well as describing the grim existence of life in the camp: the constant hunger, the daily struggle for food, the widespread snitching, and the lengths taken to avoid being beaten by guards.<br />While imprisoned together in a small cell, a man who called himself only \\"Uncle\\" gave Shin the credo: \\"Stay strong, live as long as possible, never consider suicide.\\" Suicide was commonplace in the camps, but the Party saw suicide as an escape from its grasp and would punish any family left behind as a deterrent.<br /><br />We also learn about the meager everyday life of the general public under Kim Dynasty. From \\"Great Leader\\" Kim Il Sung, who remains North Korea's Eternal President despite his death in 1994, to Kim Jong Il, Asian Elvis impersonator and world's largest single purchaser of Hennessy cognac, and finally, childhood animal torturer, Kim Jong Eun, \\"the chub\\" who undoubtedly will someday be portrayed as the villain in a James Bond film. This is a land ravaged by famine and floods where both city and country people are tasked with collecting their own feces for use as fertilizer and fuel.<br /><br />The book is a quick two-day read, which is a sound strategy because many more people will likely read it. One hopes that it will raise public awareness and outcry about a situation which we all sort of know exists but rarely crosses our consciousness.
B004T4LUPW|2.0|I didn't really like this app. It never seemed to down load my other calendar schedules like it was supposed to!

B00004TJKI|5.0|Arguably the best courtroom drama ever produced on film...THE BEST in my opinion. It has been used for years in law schools as a teaching tool. Adapted from an equally fine novel by Robert Traver (the pen name of a real Michigan attorney and judge) it features exceptional performances by an all-star cast; expert craftsmanship by director, Otto Preminger; a memorable jazz soundtrack composed by Duke Ellington (who also has a small part in the movie) and a first rate story, that truly is an anatomy of a murder. It is a bit long as the screenplay delves into aspects of jurisprudence we don't usually see on screen, such as research and investigation. It follows the book fairly closely; the only significant departure being the portrayal of Mary Pilant (Kathryn Grant) as Barney Quill's illegitimate daughter. This is one of Jimmy Stuarts finest performances and should have merited an Oscar...he lost out to Charlton Heston for &#34;Ben-Hur&#34;. Lee Remick, in only her fourth film role, is perfectly cast as the female lead and Ben Gazzara, in a breakout role for him, is also pitch perfect as her husband and the murder defendant. George C. Scott, in only his second film role, plays one of the prosecuting attorneys. Arthur O'Connor, Eve Arden, Kathryn Grant and Orson Bean flesh out what is truly an all-star cast by today's standards; although, as noted, in 1959 some of these actors were just getting started. In summary, this is a truly great film from virtually every perspective and it carries my highest recommendation...a must see for those who appreciate courtroom drama.

B006P4FBUE|4.0|Gives you two octaves to play with and honestly for a free app, it's pretty good.  You can change your instrument around and I particularly like the bells.  You have 6 or 7 options and that's fairly generous.  I like it and use it to sound out church music.  Pretty good little app for free.

0316228532|1.0|Started reading it a couple of times but have been unable to get very far, as it's boring and showcases the weaknesses of Rowling's writing, not her strengths for story-telling and wit.  Extremely rare that I don't finish any book I start, but that may be the case with this one.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I was skeptical of this case given the mixed reviews, but after destroying three otterbox defender cases in 6 months, I decided to try it. I am very glad that I did!<br /><br />After it arrived, I followed the directions in the videos to a tee! I completed the waterproof test and then put the case on my phone. About 2 weeks later, my 1 year old daughter apparently caught a bug at daycare and proceeded to engage in what I can only describe as exorcist type projectile vomiting while we were shopping, covering my phone in a white puddle of nastiness as well as the entire inside of the diaper bag that was sitting beside her.<br /><br />I obviously checked on her and cleaned her up first, and left to take her home. I COMPLETELY forgot that my phone was in the diaper bag until I saw the aforementioned white puddle it was laying in. OMG! I was freaking out. After tending to Peanut, I took the phone out and after 20 minutes of being completely saturated in baby vomit, the phone was flawless. No liquid penetrated the case. Nada. Took it apart and cleaned the case. Boom good as new. The only casualties of the vomiting spell were the diaper bag itself, a handful of diapers and some mail I had stuck in there. The case did what it promised and I am thankful for that!<br /><br />Now I will say that there is one con, the connector port for the charger is CRAZY tight. So if you dock, have non apple charging accessories or just want to be sure, I would highly suggest buying a dock extender (2 for $7 here on amazon) and that will solve that no problem. Other than that, this case survived being submerged in vomit for the duration of the drive home (who wants to attempt to clean out a vomit filled bag in public, making everyone gag?!).<br /><br />It was a nasty situation that lifeproof helped to keep from being even nastier... and for anyone curious, she was feeling fine about 12 hours later and was back to her normal self! Thank you Lifeproof

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|We enjoyed the action. Our boys thought it was fast-paced, and the family-friendly rating helped. The convenience of watching it in our home instead of the theatre was a plus, as well.

B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Works well on crafts.  Not intended for Square glass, and takes a little to get used to it. Took a couple of bottles to get used to this.  Not bad to use and not a bad price.
1476719071|5.0|I personally love this book. I've read it a few times now and still love it.  Maybe I'm dysfunctional but I like Travis. It was a great story that will have you hooked from the start. There was times in the book that I was laughing, crying, or mad like I was in the book. I am a poker buff though and I will say theme nickname bothers me a pigeon is not a winning hand its a weak player and Abby is not that.
B00338QENI|5.0|Engaging, inciteful and pretty scientific though very well explained. I would certainly recommend this book to all people out there
B006OB3K56|3.0|I love shame...has to be one of the best movies. But come on...really you are going to give me the library version and not the actually blu ray case that I see in the picture...so I was lied to and got two seperate cases for the DVD version and the BLU Ray...Kind of disappointing
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My family enjoys this game!  It is a little complicated at first but the complexity is what keeps us interested.
0060557818|4.0|I enjoyed this book because the villains and the plot held my interest but, and this is my main criticism, other than the protagonist, Richard Mayhew, I felt the heroic characters were not well-developed.  The author is a solid writer and, on occasion, offers an impressive turn of phrase.  The book was entertaining and kept me reading until the somewhat predictable end. I'd recommend it to people that enjoy \\"other worlds\\" sci-fi/fantasy.

B005HJWWW8|2.0|I knew something was wonky when I had problems with the initial charge, but it charged on the second try, so I did not immediately return the item.  However, four days later, the amp stopped taking a charge altogether.  It is a shame because the amp itself sounds great, which is why I did not one star it.  It drove my SOL Republic Tracks HD very well with my Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7.  I only had to listen to music at 50 percent volume and the amp provided better detail at lower volumes.  The only negative I had about the sound quality is the bass boost setting, which made the music sound muddy and distorted.  Fiio would be better off eliminating it completely.

B0085HWZDK|5.0|Having just recently bought and watched Led Zeppelin `Celebration Day' and been completely blown away I was wondering how I would find Robert Plant in a different musical setting which I assumed would have none of the intensity and excitement of Led Zeppelin.How wrong I was.The show starts with a completely reworked laid back version of `Black Dog' and then into the stomping `Angel Dance' which is where this gig just takes off and doesn't let up.Four glorious voices combine on `House Of Cards' and each musician is given ample opportunity to show off their vocal and instrumental talents over the next sixteen songs.At times I could hear shades of `The Band' with a nice loose feel to many of the songs.<br /><br />Robert Plant's voice is excellent and the fun they are having onstage is contagious .This Blu Ray version has superb DTS HD 5.1sound and great visual definition and if you like the`Raising Sand' and `Band of Joy' albums then this is for you.Recommended without reservation.
B000EGF0NW|5.0|great book! having been in a similar situation this book was very enlightening to read and makes you appreciate that things you have.

B008I3QZKU|1.0|Absolutely love The Killers. Horribly disappointing album. I had even loved Flowers solo project. This album though - ugh - after all their esoteric and innovative songs, they promote Runaway like it's not a combination of Rod Stewart's Young Turks with Springsteens' Thunder Road. I mean really? After all this they want to throw love-gone-wrong simplistic crap at us? What are we 16? It's like they've regressed instead of grown.<br /><br />And Springsteen I hear on it - I absolutely hate Springsteen and this has all the dark ballad type stuff Springsteen does. Plus, it just felt like every song sounded the same as the next. What happened on the hiatus? The Killers have been to the White House and even played a Harry Reid fundraiser. If they had been more tied to American Values and what is happening to this country, an album title Battle Born could have really spoken to Americans who really are Battle Born fighting the Progressives who are destroying this country. Instead we got the travails of Frankie and Johnny and an album with a misleading title. Don't waste your money on it. Hope The Killers go back to their uniqueness and also trying some new things. This album may be their ending however - leaving them stuck playing Mr. Brightside and Read My Mind for the rest of their lives.

B00873GRU4|3.0|Just the most excellent twist in the opening I've encountered in a while, then ...<br /><br />I've read authors comments in the past where they have had an idea that took ten years to eventually find a home in a story worthy of the idea. This feels like the counter example. I really struggled to finish this book after the initial couple of chapters.

B00881VLCE|4.0|Nice free app but puzzles have too few pieces then as if by magic you get more pieces then if you leave and come back you are back to 60 or less pieces. It's free for me so far so.still deserves good rating.

B000068PQ0|3.0|The Flaming Lips are awesome, I love them, and this is my favorite album by them. But the CD case was cracked when it arrived and the CD had small scratches on the underside. I bought this as a gift and the condition was posted as &#34;New&#34;. I know that it could have been cracked during shipping. I recommend shipping CD cases wrapped in bubble wrap, packaged in a box as apposed to only a single layered, bubble wrap envelope. I wouldn't mind paying the extra shipping to secure the condition.<br /><br />They still love the album.<br />The price was fair.<br />The condition was my only dissapointment.<br />3 out of 5
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|*****Probably this has a bit of spoilers so don\\"t read further in case you wish to main the story's outcome for yourself*******<br /><br />But there were a few questions that lingered in he back of my head. One being, how would Holden explain Sky to his mother? Most likely they would have to come clean about it and that would definately go into his sister and her circumstance. Maybe I just feel that her situation would not be so private for much longer. Just thought I should mention it. I also did not particularly agree with the actions she took after just barely seeing him (her father) again. Not to mention that she struggled all the way back to Holden's car and most likely left signs of that scuffle on the front lawn. Something that should have cause more attention to them but didn't. Over all it still was a good read.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Great effects but plot was thin. Unmemorable bond movie. Adele song was fantastic, however.. Gadgets were disappointing. Good franchise movement though.

B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Never expected to get so caught up in this . Well designed to make you want to constantly get to the next level. Unfortunately this urge to keep playing CAN get expensive. Uunderstand the company  naturally wants to make money but prices for extra coins could be more reasonable and they would still make $.<br />As a budget conscious senior I still succumbed to $15 worth...chastising myself for being so foolish.  I WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE MY GRANDKIDS GETTING HOOKED ON THIS..though I doubt kids are the target audience...game just not active enough for them.<br />I'll continue to play....but only with free coins at least until additional coins are less usurious...upside is the time saved can be spent exercising?
B000063UR1|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites.....Bruce Dern has always excelled at being a ver moody guy.....he is no less so in this film...but the message here is what counts.....it is the fact we can lose our natural resources if we are not careful

B00BHMF578|2.0|I am not a Ben Affleck fan. And this movie did not change my mind in the least. Except for the opening scenes of the Iranian takeover, the movie was stale, contrived and boring. How the Academy could name this best picture is mind boggling. Really shows that Hollywood has lost touch with what it takes to make a great picture. I used to go to the movies regularly and if I couldn't get to the theater, I would buy the DVD. Now, it is rare to find anything worth going for. No wonder ticket sales are dropping like a rock. At least I save money by not going to the movies. Do yourself a favor and save money by not renting this movie.

I haven't quite finished the book yet, still a few pages to go and while many things have been brought to a conclusion the end hasn't yet happened.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought this was a fad book and just one long sex scene until my mom told me she read it.  I was surprised because her usual books are &#34;vanilla&#34; compared to this one.  Downloaded a sample, was instantly hooked, and purchased the same day.  The first 200 pages were read in one night while taking shots of tequila.  The story felt so real at that point lol  Yes, there are several risque scenes, but James does well at creating an engaging story line also.

B00B6DTWM2|4.0|Disclaimer: I've loved Ethan Hawke since \\"Dead Poets Sociey.\\"  But I'm also a huge horror movie fan so would have seen \\"Sinister\\" regardless of his starring role.  As others have commented -- and as I comment in all my reviews of horror movies -- the bar has been set pretty low for horror flicks in the past few years, and I've wondered if all the good material has been used up.  \\"Sinister\\" does borrow a lot from other films; most notably it borrows its central theme from \\"The Shining.\\"  Hawke plays a true crime writer (in real life he is a writer in addition to an actor, which added something to the movie for me), looking to reclaim the glory of his past success.  He's also a husband and father who has obligations which compete with his career aspirations.  Although his character, Ellison Oswalt, is a much better father than Jack Nicholson's character in \\"The Shining,\\" there is definitely a comparison to be made here in terms of men feeling like their wife and kids are weighing them down a bit.  There's also a found footage aspect which is central to the plot, and a kind of, sort of haunted house they're living in where the family Ellison is writing about was murdered.  For all of its tried and true plot points, I will say that for the first time in a long time while watching a horror movie, I wasn't able to figure out the ending until it ended -- which I consider to be a huge plus.<br /><br />However I'm not sure if my inability to guess the culmination of events didn't have something to do with the film's odd pacing.  I felt like it started in the middle of the first act...there was very little scene setting...we're in the thick of things pretty much from the get go.  And then when I thought I was at the end of the second act, it turned out I was in the middle of the third -- there's a sudden, rapid acceleration of the plot that's kind of jarring. On a positive note, this was a refreshing change from movies that go on and on.<br /><br />What does happen in \\"Sinister?\\"  Actually, not much.  Most of the movie takes place in and on the grounds of the murder victims' house -- we frequently see their murder scene replayed throughout the movie (in fact, this is the first image we see).  Ellison spends most of the time in his home office watching old Super 8 films he found in the creepy attic that depict homicides of additional families in other locations.  We're supposed to believe that Ellison's desire for another best seller keeps him from turning this footage over to the authorities.  As he investigates the murders spooky things happen in the house, he uncovers a few details that shed some light on the situation, yadda yadda yadda, I don't like to give too much away.<br /><br />The key here is \\"supposed to believe,\\" and a lot of Ellison's actions in the movie aren't believable, but Hawke's acting is, thereby redeeming the weak plotting (other reviewers say this too).  Another thing that at least one other reviewer commented on is that the lights in the house are always off; one of the first scenes is the family eating dinner together in the near dark.  This did add a lot to the creepy feeling of the movie, but it was also disctracting as every time I saw a light switch in the background I wanted to scream, \\"Turn on the lights!\\" at my TV.  There is a scene where a law enforcement officer whose character resembles Dewey from the \\"Scream\\" franchise says something to Ellison along the lines of, \\"If I lived in this house I'd sleep with the lights on,\\" and it perhaps came off as more comical than it should have.<br /><br />I still found the movie to be effective because it doesn't give itself away and the found footage is disturbing without being gross -- although this movie is certainly not suitable for kids or anyone with delicate sensibilities and overall, the movie is perhaps beyond disturbing (but you have to get to the end to find out how much so).  I watched it yesterday and am still a little creeped out.  I like it better theday after than I did while I was watching it...although I certainly didn't want to fast forward...which for a horror movie these days is definitely not a bad thing.

She is indeed a masterful writer.<br />This is a terrific book that is amazingly researched and beautifully crafted.<br />I just wish it was required reading for our representatives in Washington D.C. as<br />they would no doubt learn a lot from reading it.

But I  was very disappointed to find that when playing from my kindle fire HD, I am unable to view how many coins I have, or access the color shop to purchase more colors.....to do that, I must go on from my phone. Y is that???? It's very frustrating! Other than that, my friends n I have a lot of fun with this game!

B002SSUQFG|5.0|As a man with small wrists (14.5cm) but average size hands, it's tough for me to find a watch that both fits my wrist and doesn't look petite next to my hands. The Seiko 5 is absolutely perfect. It is the first watch, out of the many I've owned, that is truly comfortable on my wrist without appearing feminine.<br /><br />The matte stainless finish of the case feels like a piece of high tech aircraft machinery. The crisp, clean look is simple, modest and oozes quality. Like a good blazer, it can be dressed up or down depending on how you choose to wear it. The canvas strap isn't dressy but it is comfortable, and the leather reinforcement gives it a firmer shape that I appreciate.<br /><br />The movement has been reliable for the first few weeks so far. Not having a post to wind manually has not been an issue once. Date/time work well, and it can be set to Spanish if desired.

0142413860|1.0|I love this story but the book has a kerosene type smell that I hope will dissipate when left standing open.  Made in China, go figure.  Not suitable for kids to be near the way it is.  Had hoped to share around the grandkids but not this edition.  Also the CD story reader doesn't have a bell or tone to let kids know when to turn the page, so its something they have to learn along with the story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A real page-turner; hard to put down!  Real, touching, emotionally-charged story that grabs your attention from chapter one.  Surprising twist at the end!  Great Read!!
B008G12ERC|5.0|Although I personally have preferred the harder rockers, such as Absolution and Black Holes & Revelations, I enjoyed this album much more than &#34;The Resistance&#34;. The newness of this album is unique and satisfying. Upon my first listen of the heading track, &#34;Supremacy&#34;, I knew that this would be a different Muse journey. As I moved along I realized how much of it sounded... familiar.<br /><br />I couldn't help but notice a lot of influence from other British bands, namely, the tones of Dire Straits in the solos of &#34;Animal&#34;, the David Bowie-esque song style of &#34;Panic Station&#34;, and of course, the over-the-top Queen-style in &#34;Survival&#34; as well as similar choral arrangements in &#34;Madness&#34;. I could even hear elements of Led Zeppelin on &#34;Supremacy&#34;, such as the &#34;Kashmir&#34;-style strings and the driving guitar solo break. I wouldn't be surprised to find more similarities with other Brit-rock bands my next time through.<br /><br />Hearing these similarities make the album easier to understand, catchier, and more enjoyable without being blatant rip offs of any of them. Muse also incorporates more odd time signatures and electronic components in these tracks than in previous albums. The electronica-style of the final two tracks seemed inevitable considering the popularity of electronic music coming out of the UK. I am actually pleased to see that Bellamy incorporated more of the Kaoss Pad into these tracks. Christopher Wolstenholme penned and sung a couple of new tracks, too, which were easy to digest and not overbearing.<br /><br />This albums is definitely a great buy for us who eclecticly consumer rock music from many genres and time periods. This is one of the albums that will definitely find space in my car, on my phone, and on my mp3 player.

B001P9EQH8|2.0|The packaging is great and from that aspect the product is well designed, but there simply isn't enough gain to get the job done.  I measured the voltage gain at only 4.6db making the product a complete waste of money.  I needed the product to drive my aviation headset with 300 Ohm speakers, and this device makes only a slightly noticeable difference in volume.    Buy something else.    9/11/14  I've since opened the unit and increased the voltage gain (replace the two 0603 47K feedback resistors with a larger value).  A purest may disagree with the sound quality of the increased gain, but I'm using the amplifier for an aviation headset in a very noisy aircraft.  As a side note the unit is fairly well built with easily obtained components should repair ever be needed.  Even the battery is easy to obtain and replace.

B000OVLIQU|5.0|This is the best engineer/producer book I’ve read to date.  Geoff explained the recording techniques used in those early pop days in terms that could easily be understood by the novice as well as unmasking some of the little mistakes that the tech savvy has always wondered about.  There are plenty of anecdotes about his personal relationship with the Beatles and the interpersonal relationships in the band.  I found the book to be quite similar to Willie Perkins’ book “No Saints, No Saviors” in that it the book delivers so much character development that you’ll enjoy reading the book over and over again.  In contrast, George Martin’s “All You Need Is Ears” lacks any serious insight into the band, is more autobiographical and lacks specific recording details.  My only complaint would be “more”.  I’d like to hear more stories about the band, more details about the recordings and even more about Badfinger and other bands.  I will read Geoff’s book again, he did a great job.<br /><br />I have to give you a warning though; Geoff really didn’t think much of George’s guitar playing until “Abbey Road”, so if you’re a huge George fan, be prepared, but not offended.

111846446X|3.0|Intrigued by this product once I read about it in the NY Times, I ordered a Raspberry Pi along with the guide written by the co-founder of the Foundation.  In retrospect, I should have also bought the SD card that comes pre-loaded with an Operating System (OS) because I spent numerous hours trying to create my own SD card, first using a Windows PC.  When that failed, I tried on a MAC.  No success either.<br /><br />I understand and accept that this product is for tinkerers so I do not regret all the time spent.  However, I did not expect to have to be an experienced &#34;geek&#34; with basic understanding of the DOS commands to create the SD card.  I guess this is exactly the goal of the Raspberry Pi: get people to learn the inside workings of a basic computer.<br /><br />So I reluctantly returned the product.  Yes, I could have purchased the preloaded SD card but my sense of pride got in the way.  I swallowed that pride and concluded that, if I could not get started with booting properly, I was not destined to do much with the Pi afterwards.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|This movie isn't as bad as they say.  It's pretty fun to watch although it's not the best Star Trek movie either.  The DVD specials are pretty cool.  If you like Star Trek you should pick this up.
0811875040|3.0|Miette's cakes and desserts are gorgeous and delicious. This book is a real treat for those who covet good looking and tasting desserts. The pictures are beautiful and make this book great to browse through. The recipes are exact, and the baking tips/techniques are valuable as it comes from a seasoned, professional baker.<br /><br />However, for the average at home baker, the recipes are extremely impractical. Each recipe makes numerous portions, which is not a frequent occasion for a family, unless you're baking for a party.
0802130208|3.0|Every once and a while I read a book because I'm supposed to, whether because it won the Pulitzer or Nobel or Booker, or some other prestigious prize, or it's just old enough to have been granted \\"classic\\" status.<br /><br />Usually, the book turns out to be just as good, or at least just as notable, as it is supposed to be.<br /><br />With \\"Confederacy of Dunces,\\" though, I've found that I'm at a loss. I don't know what to think about it, let alone what I'm supposed to think about it.<br /><br />There's no doubt that it's brilliant. From the first sentence (\\"A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head.\\"), the pages drip with colorful language, signs of a masterful command of the English language. Witty, cynical, sarcastic, and, again, witty, the writing is a delight to read.<br /><br />But what is it? Is it satire? Is it comedy? I admit, as soon as I finish here I'm going to go pick up a literary review or two by someone who knows what they're talking about, someone who can tell me what the book means. Because, like driving by a really bad multivehicle accident, at first glance it's not clear what's going on or how it happened. And, when were watching the dunces that are the main characters, it's hard not to see it as a car accident about to happen, or happening.<br /><br />Or rather, what it means, what the commentary is, on race, on gays, on the sixties, on New Orleans...or if it's even commentary at all.<br /><br />At the very least, or perhaps most, the book made me laugh, smile and cringe, sometimes all at once. Why exactly it won the Pulitzer I couldn't say, but it was worth the read.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good book I cant wait to read the rest of the series. To see what happens with peeta,katniss,and gale. On to the next book!
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I thought I read the second season was a bit more over the top than the first, but halfway through and I'm enjoying it. Seems a good balance. It definitely captured the book ... it's been several months since I read it but I felt like I already saw several scenes because they are so close to what I read and imagined in the book. Definitely enjoying this CD set! I'm not one to use a lot of bonus features or other add-ons so my review is strictly focused on the main episodes.

1616960922|4.0|I've not read many books by Brandon Sanderson that weigh in at less than several hundred pages, so when I saw the thin spine of The Emperor's Soul  sitting on the shelf at Weller Book Works next to Sanderson's thicker novels, I was immediately curious.<br /><br />Sanderson is rightly proud of what he's produced in The Emperor's Soul. I've heard, though I can't recall where, that he wrote it in his \\"spare time,\\" between other commitments, and if that's the case, he should be all the more proud. The story is tight, the characters are interesting, and the descriptions are colorful.  Sanderson divides the story into chapters  labelled for the days Shai passes in captivity, planning her escape and creating the emperor's new soul.  It's a simple trick, but it keeps the clock ticking, moving the story forward with a tension that matches the conflict.<br /><br />Not a word is wasted. Sanderson is typically careful with language, but The Emperor's Soul felt even more attentive to strict control.  Each word adds no more, and no less, than the story absolutely needs.  After finishing the more weighty A Memory of Light (co-authored by Sanderson), the product of two decades of work and a cast of characters sufficiently large to merit its own wiki, it was refreshing to indulge in Sanderson's ability to spin a tale cut loose from the trappings that too much world building can add. Don't get me wrong--epic fantasy done right is enjoyable. But The Emperor's Soul focuses solely on the story, and the development of characters, that makes for good fiction.<br /><br />Sanderson indicates that The Emperor's Soul takes place in the same world as his debut novel, Elantris  , and if you've read that and are attentive, you'll see some of the similarities, though the magic system is not the same one as used in that novel.  It does, however, follow strict rules and guidelines, as Sanderson's magic systems typically do.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quick read, want a taste of Brandon Sanderson, but aren't ready to commitment to a full series (Sanderson's  The Way of Kings  is the first in a ten novel series, and is over a thousand pages long) then The Emperor's Soul might be the choice for you. With engaging and empathetic characters, a fantasy setting that transcends \\"swords and sorcery\\" tropes, and moral dilemmas that develop with the characters, it's a worthy and enjoyable novel to read.erson, but aren't ready to commitment to a full series (Sanderson's  The Way of Kings  is the first in a ten novel series, and is over a thousand pages long) then The Emperor's Soul might be the choice for you.

B009POHHRG|5.0|I wish I had read this sooner. Love that the story is more about Joker than it is about Batman.
B009TH2ENG|2.0|I love Fables. I even liked Jack of Fables. But this &#34;story&#34; and i use the term lightly feels both sloppy (huge huge plot holes the likes of which no other Fables story has ever seen) and the art is, simply put, bad (from coloring errors and uneven shades to inconsistent character faces). All in all, it would do better for Fables' reputation to pull this fiasco from publication altogether. The only reason i gave it 2 stars and not just the one is because even after all the bad, it is still somewhat Fables related.

0765325950|4.0|Although I finished A Memory of Light over a week ago, I've hesitated to write a review. Reaching the end of a good novel is not unlike leaving the dark of a movie theater for the light of day. Coming back into the real world can be a bit of a jolt. The jolt at the end of A Memory of Light for me came after a marathon reading session where I plowed through the end of the epic, watched heroes and villains alike die, and a final denouement. Twenty years after I first opened The Eye of the World and met Rand, Mat, and Perrin, I found myself closing A Memory of Light in a daze.<br /><br />I started the fourteen volume series with The Eye of the World at 15 when Greg Stephenson, a friend with a penchant for finding the \\"next big thing,\\" recommended and loaned a copy to me. It didn't take me long to fall into the story. It was a world alive and vibrant, a tale about boys not much older than myself, suddenly swept up on a dangerous adventure to save the world, travelling to lands exotic and distant, fighting foes they knew only from legend. What boy wouldn't love that? They were on a hero's quest, and I loved every page of it.<br /><br />As the years passed and the series grew, so did the number of characters, plot lines, and intricacy. There have been high and low points, but with A Memory of Light Brandon Sanderson has with a careful and deft hand closed the tale in the world that Robert Jordan created with a novel that is both satisfying and bittersweet. Satisfying because the A Memory of Light really is, for me, one of the more enjoyable of the series. Bittersweet because with its close I must say goodbye to so many characters that I have watched grow and change.<br /><br />But perhaps I wax too eulogistic. With so many story lines integrating, the action is busy, but the pace is exciting and moves with alacrity. Sanderson is at his best, painting a scene with the colors that Jordan has left for him that is vivid and gripping.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the story, but I will admit that there were moments where characters died so suddenly and unexpectedly that I was left flipping pages to make sure I hadn't been mistaken. Others survived that I had not expected, and yet others made choices that were both surprising and foreshadowed.<br /><br />If you've not read the previous novels in The Wheel of Time, now is a great time to start. The ride is satisfying, even if the commitment does at times seem daunting. Robert Jordan died before finishing the series, leaving a legacy unfinished and a large reader base with an unfinished story. Brandon Sanderson has crafted a wonderful and fulfilling conclusion to the series that Jordan created, and millions of fans will be ever grateful. The fantasy genre is often dismissed as lesser fiction, but Jordan's novels regularly made the New York Times bestseller lists due to its broad and mass appeal.<br /><br />It's a tribute to Sanderson that he was able to, using only the notes left by Jordan, finish The Wheel of Time with three novels each a hefty door-stopper with dozens and dozens of characters and plot lines to be tied together. Sanderson has proven himself a writer of the first class, and I look forward to seeing more from him in coming years. I've met Brandon twice, once at the release of his own Way of Kings and more recently this last weekend at a signing of A Memory of Light at Weller Book Works in Salt Lake City. I arrived late, and by the time the line wound down, it was late. Sanderson remained genial, friendly, and accommodating. For a guy who just successfully finished one of the most anticipated novels in fantasy since George R.R. Martin's A Dance with Dragons (if not more so)., but I will admit that there were moments where characters died so suddenly and unexpectedly that I was left flipping pages to make sure I hadn't been mistaken.

B00005JKC3|5.0|I missed this in the theaters so was looking forward to it on DVD. Leave it to Ang Lee to take on another genre and nail it. I watched this twice the first night I rented it and bought it a week later. It loses nothing with multiple viewings. Like X-Men, director Lee made outstanding casting choices which raises this above standard super-hero fare and turns it into a brilliant, albeit dark, character study. Jennifer Connelly (who not only turns in a wonderful performance but is absolutely stunning!), Sam Elliot and especially Nick Nolte all turn in Oscar worthy performances. I think the bad box office killed any award possibilities which usually are heaped upon most of Lee's films. Eric Bana is the one weak cast member, but his awkward speech patterns (I think he's Australian) fit okay into the nerdy and stunted personality of his character. The Hulk effects range between excellent and so-so, but the star of The Hulk is the story not the FX. This movie uses the focal point of the father/son relationship of Superman the Movie (still the best superhero epic) and turns it on its ear. Where Clark Kent had his brilliant loving Kryptonian Father, Jor-el and equally loving and caring Jonathan Kent on earth, to David Banner poor Bruce is nothing more than an experiment gone wrong, a failed research project to dissect and study. Chilling.<br /><br />PS. This adaptation has only gotten better with age... Apologies to Edward Norton and Mark Ruffalo...
1595141715|5.0|As I worked my way through the chapters, all I could think was &#34;My teenagers have to read this&#34; (and they will), because as Hannah pointed out in the book, we never know the impact we have on other people.<br /><br />The dual narration worked well for the book, and the characters were believable, especially Hannah, in the end, after she had given up. Clay came off as sympathetic and his interaction with the others (his mom, his neighbor Tony, the gentleman at the counter at the coffee shop, etc.) was compelling. I started reading the book and was unable to put it down until I finished it.<br /><br />Other reviews stated Hannah's character was annoying and her reasons minute, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I think it fair to point out that what as an adult, the world is bigger as are the problems. In high school, what may seem minute to us, may be the size of the world to others. It all goes back to the title of this review, and I believe, what Mr. Asher intended: we don't know what other people are going through and should carefully consider our actions.

0812993357|4.0|If you grew up like me, poring over fashion magazines, enraptured by the glamour, dreaming of the excitement, wanting to be an editor, and oh, let's not forget the CLOTHES!--then this book will enrapture you equally.<br /><br />Reading every nugget of this memoir had me glued, gasping, wowing at how Grace has basically worked with every important mover and shaker in fashion from the 60's, 70s, 80s, 90s, and 00s. That's FIVE decades, my friends. Names that are living legends in their own rights, such as Cecil Beaton, Patrick Demarchelier, Liz Tilberis, Arthur Elgort, Galliano, and many more.<br /><br />Grace was fortunate to be born at the right place at the right time with the right looks and the right friends. However, having accomplished so much, she herself has become a living legend and massive contributor to fashion today. This book is aspirational, inspirational, and will undoubtedly become a classic 'fashion bio', along with Diana Vreeland's DV.<br /><br />If you truly love fashion, and i mean TRULY LOVE it, then this is your \\"Fashion Legends 101\\", which is required reading.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Too much humanism personal philosophy and repeated formula harlequin romance style read one read them all too predictable story line
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Love<br /><br />It's amazing and the art work is beautiful. Also Carl is a bigger badass than I thought he killed Shane without hesitation. I watch the show and its great too!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Best time wasting game I've played. The never ending challenges keep it interesting. I've played for over fifteen hours total, and I'm still not bored with it.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|I thought this was a very good, and I liked the idea of it. Anyone who is looking for a mind blowing movie that will also give you the chills!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is great for just about anyone to read. It has taught me why I look hard for positive comments and how to love my fiancé better such a great book and simple yet amazing concepts!
0547260695|5.0|This is one of the most stunning books, even better than I imagined! It was a gift for my nephew but I kind of wish I could keep it for myself!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome and it just let out an update 0.6.1 it is cool but the moving controls are a bit hard.
B000BGH2CM|5.0|this is one of the best wrestlemanias ever, almost every match on here was great(except goldberg v brock, it was not a wrestlemania match it was a waste of time) hhh vs hbk vs chris benoit one of the best main events ever
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is great.  Sky is witty and relatable and the passion between her and Holden will make even grown women blush.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I really like this game. its really fun and gets really addictive. I really think its neat!! The only thing is that since you do the same thing many times over a over again it gets a bit boring. The missions are gun though.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|We love zombies, and this is a older kid friendly movie containing zombies. It is a touching story, yet incredibly scary - perfect for a thriller movie night with the kids.
0307591549|4.0|I'm using this as one of three books for a graduate class on positive psychology and leadership, and also for a faculty-staff book group. Participants in the course and book group love it.<br />Achor effectively makes the case that happiness produces success rather than success producing happiness, clarifies seven important research-based principles for retraining oneself to be happy, and shows that one's happiness can affect the happiness of others. By narrowing the literature to focus on seven principles, he is able to effectively explain each. It's a solid book, grounded in the literature, and Achor's teaching and consulting experience.<br />Compared to other books on happiness, it's more readable, and the principles are more memorable. Of the books I've read on this topic, there is only one I prefer - Sonja Lyubomirsky's The How of Happiness.
B001GWUBSC|5.0|An amazing series! I really enjoyed this series and wish I could have afforded to purchased all four box sets. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys history and while this King Henry does not get fat, Jonathan does an amazing job at being King!!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This book kept me hooked the whole way through and the characters are compelling and relatable.  I will now read all of Tom Rob Smith's other work.
0316044695|5.0|I bought this book while I was in Texas and let me tell you, it moved me. It gave me even more of an appreciation for the U.S. Military, especially Navy Seals. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in modern day military stories.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The app sucks I gust bought it to get stuff on another app! A a a a a a a a a
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It was okay. Parts of it were really great but it had some VERY slow parts that I'd like to skip over.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|What can I say about the Sound Of Madness????  Brent Smith seems to have his hand on my pulse.  He writes the things I want to say. And his vocals are incredible. It's impossible to pit one album against another because each Shinedown album contains many shining examples of perfection in both lyrical and vocal work. If you haven't heard Shinedown, you are seriously missing out. I would suggest you start with their full length DVD show and see for yourself what you are missing. And then buy every single one of their CDs to catch up because each one stands alone and yet together, they tell the entire story. Don't miss out as they continue their rise to further glory!!!!
0316228532|1.0|After 240 pages of tedious exposition, the plot finally started moving forward. Up until that point I had to force myself to keep reading, in the hopes that it would eventually grab my interest. But after spending 503 pages with a town full of ugly, pathetic, miserable, petty characters - none of which you really root for - the sad, pathetic ending petered out and I realized that this is one of the lousiest stories I've ever read. Don't waste your time.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I enjoy the story line from all the books. I hope there will be more with Maddy workin with her dad!
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|Fun and adventurous enough for my teen boys and engaging enough for the adults.  Life lessons included if you follow the script.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn impressed me as a good writer - the suspense in this book was awsome.  The characters were interesting, tho difficult for me to believe the entire premise - that people could act, and react, in such a manner.  I will read one more of Ms. Flynn's books, just to see if she comes up with more unbelievable episodes. Incidentally, I hated the ending of Gone Girl!  Perhaps that is what the writer wanted...if so, she achieved it in me.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Gives me the opportunity to save information that would ordinarily forget from day to day. Being older,this gives me a invaluable tool to keep up with the younger set.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Cabaret fans can at least rejoice that there is now a vastly improved home video product available (the old dvd wasn't even anamorphic). To clarify a few things that fellow reviewers have said: this is indeed a hi-def product. The film is very gritty and grainy-looking...it's supposed to look that way. The bluray is good and grainy; as things should be. Don't be fooled by those who think Cabaret should somehow look sharp and pristine as modern films--it should not! It looks exactly the way it was meant to look. As for the sound--the audio masters were lost long, long ago. What we have here is a stereo recreation using available materials. Some have said this makes the movie sound \\"tinny\\" or compressed. Actually, on my sound system, it sounded very clear and realistic. This is not booming surround sound from a modern action film...it sounds like you're sitting in the Kit Kat Club listening to the numbers as they are performed. Very, very good job on this.  There is one new extra for this bluray release; it is a 1/2 hour documentary. This one reunites much of the surviving cast including Joel Grey, Liza Minnelli, Michael York, Bob Fosse's daughter, some of the Kit Kat dancers and others. Most of the conversation and anecdotes revolve around the life and work of Bob Fosse. This new doc is presented in hi def. Dvd extras and docs have been ported over. Overall, I give this bluray release five stars: it is exactly how Cabaret should look and sound and be preserved for generations to come.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|The addition of the gravity fields is a real added plus to the angry bird family.  It takes a new type of skill level
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Engaging but not what was expected.  Not a bad movie but could have been more...hmmm...just more.  A more modern spin off of Snow White with a medieval twist.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I understand a movie is being made.  Should be a good one.  This book kept me on edge all the way through.  If you're looking for a story to keep you up at night - this one is for you.  My only question - why the last chapter?  It was a wonderful story...why make waves?  Guess I'll need to ask the author that question if I want an answer. I do recommend this book - enjoy...
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Gives a quick response to the words l need defined l have not had a word yet that it  has not given me the definition.
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a great book! I loved the vigor and honesty of Strayed's writing. She has the ability to capture emotion as well as clear-headed observation - even of the painful details of her own not-so-perfect life. Wild is a personal, spiritual journey of the highest order. Any long hike on the Coast Trail might be worth reading, but Strayed takes her trip to the level to the level of pilgrimage. She gives me hope for our species.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Skyfall has a nice gritty feel that makes the movie feel like the Ian Fleming books.  Opening action scene doesn't disappoint and plenty to keep viewer engaged all the way through.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|This is the second adapatation of James  Lee  Burke's  powerful<br />  storytelling.<br /><br />  Burke, a  total  American Master,  knows much about living,  and<br />  life  in  America, and  takes us fans  in to  a  world  of dread,<br />  and  rising  paranoia  in his original  novel: \\" In The  Electric<br />  Mist  with  Confederate  Dead\\".<br /><br />  Bertrand  Tavernier, usually  a  pretty  good  director  and raconteur,<br />  falls  desperately  short  of  Burke's  mark,  as  he attempts  to<br />  adapt  Burke's  thriller.  There are  brilliant  sequences  in  Burke's<br />  novel of greed, revenge  and  redemption, that  involve  Detective<br />  Robicheaux  having  conversations with a  REAL  Confederate  General !<br /><br />  In the novel, Robicheaux is  guided,  morally, by this phantasm.<br /><br />  Not  here.<br /><br />  Tommy  Lee  Jones  is  hugely  miscast as  Dave Robicheaux, a  New Iberia<br />  Parish,  Louisiana  Sheriff's  Department  Detective.<br /><br />  Jones  has  the weathered  look  of  age  and crepitude  of  the<br />  Robicheaux  we've  read  about  in  Burke's  many  novels,  but<br />  Jones'  interpretation  of  our ( unlikely) hero,  is  shallow, and<br />  pseudo - gritty.<br /><br />  This  Robicheaux is  \\"Robicheaux  Lite\\".  Jones  plays a  depthless,<br />  one-dimensional  guy  who  is  just  lost in a  booze-laden  dream-<br />  world.<br /><br />  The  real  Robicheaux,  is a  recovering  alcoholic,  hard-working,<br />  sensitive, loving,  with an  adopted  daughter,  and  a  second  wife,<br />  a  former  nun,  who is  long-suffering,  and  is a  \\"stand-by-your-<br />  man\\"  kind  of  a  girl.<br /><br />  Tavernier's  rocket  fails  to  ignite  at  the  lunch  pad,  folks.<br /><br />  Find  the  book, or  even  better, look in  AMAZON.COM  for  the  AUDIO-<br />  BOOK, professionally  read by Mister  Will Patton.<br /><br />  The  audio  book  is  FIVE  STARS  OUT OF  FIVE.<br /><br />  I  can  think of  abouttwenty  directors  who  would  have  given<br />  Burke's  treatment of Louisiana  heros  and  villains  a  better<br />  send-off.<br /><br />  Sorry....two  stars.<br /><br />  H. E.  Sawyer, PhD
0399160450|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am a huge Clancy fan, but have been fairly disappointed in his last two books - they are, in my opinion, real stinkers. This book kept me engaged the entire read, and I certainly felt as though Clancy et al have their mojo back. It always annoys me when reviews give the story away, so in an attempt to help readers decide on whether to buy it, all I'll say is that Clancy's development of the characters have the consistent cowboy swagger, as well as the same propensity to get into trouble. His analytical style still exists, but it only compliments the story and is, in my humble opinion, necessary given the topic.<br /><br />The main topic was excellent and seems to be extremely relevant given the recent news.<br /><br />Yes, it is a big book, but a fast read. I read it over a weekend.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Got all Michael's books.  He is my favorite writer.  believable... interesting ... keeps you guessing... well written.. different stories each time, keeping the theme, but not a repeat.  Would recommend his books anytime.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is entertaining and fun this gamecan make time fly when your  bored.And Wat's also kool about it is that its free! Who doesn't like free awesome stuff :)
B00B3MN65K|4.0|I really like listening to anything Josh groban sings, even when it's in a language I don't understand.  The trouble with mp3 is that there are no liner notes that could include a translation.
B000ICXQHE|5.0|You'd  better  put  your  seat  belts  on for  Spike  Lee's  gut<br />  wrencher of  a  unique  crime  tale,  that  boasts  Jodie Foster,<br />  Clive Owen, Christopher  Plummer, Kim Director,  Willem  Dafoe,<br />  and a  triplehelping  of  Denzel  Washington.  Clive  Owen is a<br />  planner/mastermind who muscles in to a New York bank, and maintains<br />  a meteoric  performance ( I  mean  the  character!) and a  controlled,<br />  menacing tone  that  will unravel  your  nervous  system,  as  Owen's<br />  anti-hero wages  war against a banker-financier,  whose  life  since<br />  World  War  Two,  houses  a  terrible  secret...one  that  could<br />  destroy  him, and  take  down  his billion-dollar  organization,  at<br />  the same  time.  Jodie's  performance  is  masterful, also,  as  a<br />  beautiful, savvy,  facilitator  who can  help  get  everyone  what<br />  they  want...but  at  what  cost  to  them...and  her ?<br /><br />  No  spoilers  here,  folk.  See  this nail biter....you  can  get  this<br />  Spike  Lee  masterpiece  at  AMAZON.COM  online....so get  your  corn<br />  a'poppin' children...'cause  you're  goin' for  a  ride !!!!<br /><br />  FIVE  STARS.<br /><br />  (Language. Some  violence.  No  nudity)<br /><br />  H. E. Sawyer, PhD
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Once you start watching this series, it'll get you hooked! The cast of actors is outstanding!!! Who would have thought that Malcolm in the Middles dad could act this great!  Can't imagine anyone else in this role.
B002VXGW2E|2.0|I was always happier when Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci were on the screen. They were wonderful playing Mr and Ms Julia Child, but the modern couple not so much fun. And one wishes for more depth in the Julia C characterization. But a solid movie.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I love the game but every time I click on the app it just stays on that screen and doesn't load at all. The game is really cool but I had to remove it from my device because it was just in the way. I hope you believe me.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|Good for Twilight withdrawals. This show is awesome! The actors are so attractive and the story line keeps you guessing! Love, love, love it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Wow it really keeps you on your toes. Couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Lots of addictive fun while maintaining a very challenging game time after time. You want to try to keep beating your own record.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|First off, watch this (and the squeal) before watching The Avengers. The movie is a little long but like The Avengers, there is so much action the time is going to fly by. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Potts his assistant (and more). There is a lot comedy in this movie (which you should expect with Robert Downey Jr.)!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved this third season as much as, if not more than, the first two!  Can't wait for the next one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is filled with surprises! Sky is adopted by her new mom. She for  through an emotional roller coaster  to get where she is now. Great fir teens and adults, love it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I would recommend this app to anyone with a Kindle Fire. I use it several times a week and I've had zero problems with it.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I did this backwards, I saw the first Iron Man movie, then the Avengers and then the second Iron Man movie and this movie. Very good movie and will give you a better understanding of Captain America's role (and his story) in the Avengers. So, if you have seen this movie yet (or Thor for that matter) and want to see the Avengers, watch this first (and the Iron Man movies).
0812993292|5.0|This book is enjoyable and appreciated by many of my friends.  I am looking forward to reading it very soon.
