B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I put off using Evernote to the chagrin of my friends who used it. I was only hurting myself. I use this app on my Mac, iPhone, &amp; Kindle now, and after only a week feel more in control of my lists and notes than ever before. Hint: Use Omnifocus in addition to Evernote and watch your life transform. It's expensive though...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is family friendly and really fun. It is really fun to have to earn the points to unlock games
B0054JZC6E|1.0|OMG! this is probably one of the worst apps I have ever downloaded .I thought I saw going to get these apps without having to download them but this is what I get. I also thought this would work and look like Angry Birds.Instead I got a big list of apps that I had to download and some wouldn't even work .I didn't even know how to get points. Don't say I didn't warn you, DON'T GET THIS APP
B004LZF2LW|5.0|Like I said I really don't need this app, my phone (HTC Amaze/Ruby 4G) already does some of what this app can do. My first android was a Samsung Vibrant 4G and fortunately making folders on it was easy for me, on my HTC ...well lol not so much. So I went through some of the free apps I had collected and I found I had an app folder organizer. It's working great on this phone. What I'm trying to say is sure some people probably don't need this app, I don't need it now that's for sure but what if the next phone I get doesn't have a clock to my liking? Doesn't hurt to have a backup :) Will update if I run into any problems but so far its ok.

B006PTL1QM|1.0|Oh, where to begin with this ... well, I guess if you \\"dramatize\\" bits from the lives of \\"important\\" people, the film itself becomes de facto \\"important\\" and \\"weighty,\\" right?  I mean -- it's GOTTA be!  Ya'all get POINTS just for trying!<br /><br />Ugh.<br /><br />ACTUALLY: Under the creakiness of such a premise (one feels, as one often does in these situations, that the diegesis/narrative tension is all but a weight on you while \\"submitting\\" yourself to it, more ponderous than any high school/college lecturer bore could ever've been), one feels so chastened that one's ability to \\"like\\" the film on one's own initiative is all but completed squashed (\\"How DARE you think differently!  How DARE you not 'grapple' with this!\\" etc., etc.), making it an act of prolonged ethical/artistic cowardice since, y'know ... \\"success\\" is \\"guarranteed\\"!<br /><br />Meanwhile, to sum up, here's what you (actually) get:<br /><br />-- verisimilitudinousness (now THERE's a word for ya!) layered in such a thick, mortar-around-bricks sort of way that the effect is, oddly, implausible.  One gets the sense that -- ha ha -- EVERY FRICKIN' LINE in the movie (or, like, almost) actually \\"happened\\" and the whole shebang was just sandwiched together to fit in a 2 hrs. plus-or-minus running time and insure \\"inescapable plausibility.\\"  But -- and here's the real \\"but\\" -- for those of us whom (either in an academic setting or, perhance, out of our own \\"self-starting\\" curiousity) have happened across ANY of the real Freud and/or Jung's writings these characterizations strike one as ... \\"off.\\"  Like they didn't care to capture them, exactly: just the \\"Icon\\" status the viewers is all but forced to \\"submit\\" to.  (Most film critics, curiously or not, seem unaware of this -- or, more likely, unable to PERCEIVE this.  Well, you don't HAVE to read Freud and/or Jung -- EVER -- to NECESSARILY be a \\"well-rounded\\" person [I suppose] ... but, if you're just going to \\"show up\\" at the film that's \\"handed to you\\" and just start off as a matter-of-course with something like \\"Oh yeah, of course: Freud and Jung!  Totally!  I get it!\\" you're either going to: (1.) miss much or (2.) catch little, however you want to put it!)<br /><br />-- a rather horrific culture-wide precedent set herein; specifically, the scene where the very-adept actress Keira Knightley is instructed to -- front & center -- replicate \\"madness\\" [compulsive, labored switching, for our viewing pleasure] which none-too-many viewers, not aware of Cronenberg's madness [he's totally NOT gay, in case you were wondering!] may not have \\"protected\\" themselves from, by shutting their eyes during that scene and \\"keeping it out\\" of their heads [YOU didn't do this, did you?  Too bad!].  Knowing that there are, in fact, people in Psyche Wards who are TRULY unhinged -- and not just there for the convenience of their \\"concerned\\" relatives or Pfizer & Co.'s or the psychiatric \\"profession\\" as practiced by (mostly) M.D.'s nowadays -- but have, in fact, fallen down such a DEEP \\"internal well\\" that just being NEAR them can compromise your ability, to soon-therafter ... well ... let's just say some things aren't so easily \\"shaken off\\" and leave it at that, okay?  [That is, unless you believe \\"culture shock\\" is a MYTH, or are otherwise not fit for post-6th grade life without pseudo-bravadoic \\"scoffing\\" at anything LARGER than yourself -- yeah, GOOD LUCK with THAT!]<br /><br />Soooo ... some several-times-several months [maybe sixteen? twenty-seven? I forget . . . ] after \\"Adbusters\\" first ran a series limning the \\"leakage\\" of the so-called \\"torture porn\\" [well ... you gotta call it SUMPTHIN', dontcha?] into mainstream culture/advertising/network T.V. programs [yah: those are some real great \\"kicks\\" to start foisting off on the kids!], \\"Interview\\" magazine -- catching the \\"slow down and run backwards\\" pull of this film -- has run (in its current issue) a \\"fashionably institutionalized\\" spread in its pages ... as though drooling, incontinence, and (perhaps) unrecoverable-from psychic trauma is \\"alluring\\" ... great!  Just great!  (Like that would've EVER happened without \\"deep\\" Croneyberg propping alluring, competent & magnetic Keira in front of a 35mm camera for our viewing pleasure ... again: terrific!)<br /><br />-- lastly, making a \\"20/20 hindsight\\" effort along these lines would, in fact, be USEFUL if one didn't lose track of that fact that we all, nowadays, are similarly \\"bound\\" ... rather than, say, just looking back -- safely ensconced in our \\"knowing-better,\\" modern perspective -- and going \\"DEEP!\\" for the duration of the movie.<br /><br />But, of course, that last would actually entail:<br /><br />[1.] Drawing parallels in the then-current, post-Industrial Revolution, pre-World Wars world-stage (rather just tacking on an \\"inexplicable\\"/\\"inevitable\\"/\\"helpless ground-level view\\" epilogue; you know, those WORLD WARS just, like, \\"happened\\"!) that were just then becoming barely possible before becoming horrifically smashed by the \\"momentums\\" beyond the horizon (i.e., Bram Stoker's \\"[[ASIN:0142005150 The Illustrated Dracula (Penguin Illustrated Classics)]],\\" itself both a deep meditation on psyche/physical body/materia interaction and an allegory of Old World resentments clawing their way into the English-speaking world's \\"plentitude\\") -- and, like you know, the OTHER FILM stuff being done, at the time (Cronenberg apparently expects us to ignore/have never heard of the work of Bunuel/Dali like \\"[[ASIN:B0006IUE9I Un Chien Andalou]],\\" subjecting us, instead, to a \\"Masterpiece Theater\\" rendering of how these silly people -- \\"pot kettle black\\" -- couldn't quite keep all their insights in line!).  When Andre Breton -- founder of Surrealism, and considered an \\"abandoner\\" of his French brethren for fleeing the continent during W.W.I.I. -- came back with his \\"[[ASIN:1931243271 Arcanum 17 (Green Integer)]]\\" prose-poem, CORRECTLY assessing the hatred of the female/intuitive that overwhelmed the Western Civilized world, we all were granted a \\"reprieve\\" from \\"not-knowing\\" what to make of it.

B0076NAWWA|5.0|Wasn't sure what this album would sound like , but after just one listen ......I must say how great this album is ..!It is a mix of all these great musicians , and if you like Progressive Rock then by this CD! ItT is that good , as it has all the elements from the great drumming to the awesome guitar work , and the vocals fit in so well , and the bass palying is off the chatrs , as a matter of fact the whole damn album is great, and i can not wait until i get to listen to it going home from work. It usually takes three listens , but this on grabbed me on the first time!
B006PTZNSY|1.0|What happened to the old Nicki? She is dead and gone! The new Nicki wants to compete with Lady Gaga, Rihana, and Katy Perry but fails to do so with this trash of an album. Back to the drawing board you go before we forget you ever existed!

B004LZF2LW|5.0|Love this app. Widget looks great and allows me to display all the time zones I need to keep track of.
0345803485|5.0|I must admit that's am not much into the leisure reading scene due to lack of time, however, a friend of mine told me to read it for a book club of hers.  I decided that I had spring break coming up do decided to go for it.  All is can say is that trying to explain the story line outside the context of the book would sell it short of what the story offers.  There are several sex scenes that made me blush.  It was such a unique story for me. I could not put the book down.  I am an inexperienced leisure reader, mostly childhood books like Harry Potter and Hunger Games, but I could not stop reading.  Highly recommended, after the first few chapters it gets intense, but the story is more than just kinky sex with a billionaire.  It's every girl's love story...bad billionaire turned good by an innocent, college graduate who is unaware of her beauty.

B004EPZ03Y|3.0|I grew up in Baltimore County. We watched Washington TV as well as Baltimore's, and the Muppets were a delight. Their five-minute nightly show, \\"Sam and Friends\\", mostly comprised the Muppets doing goofy or weird versions of popular songs. (For example, Kermit plays with an inchworm that turns out to be the tip of the tail of a huge monster that swallows him.) Jim Henson also produced brilliant Muppet-based commercials for local businesses. (You can see these on YouTube. They are startlingly violent and downright nasty, even by modern standards.)<br /><br />As with Mickey Mouse cartoons, the Muppets were never intended as kiddie entertainment. But Americans -- whose \\"taste\\" in entertainment is virtually non-existent -- associate puppets and animated films with children. This, combined with the success of the Muppets as part of \\"Sesame Street\\", and their //failure// on SNL, cemented the view that the Muppets existed to provide cute, family-safe entertainment.<br /><br />Since then, the Muppets have done nothing the least-bit subversive (other than Sam the Eagle, who is an obvious poke at conservatives). Worse, almost everything they do is in a shallow show-biz vein. \\"The Muppets\\" is a rehash of their first film, when they try to break into show business. Only /this/ version is suffused with a maudlin sentimentality that gets worse as it progresses.<br /><br />Which isn't to say \\"The Muppets\\" doesn't have some very funny moments (I particularly liked the slap at Universal Orlando), but Brian Henson, et al, need to find a way to make the Muppets appealing to an intelligent adult audience. \\"The Muppets Take South Park\\", perhaps?<br /><br />PS: Note that Walter's discovering his attraction to the Muppets can be interpreted as a metaphor for \\"something else\\".<br /><br />PPS: Last night I saw a few minutes of Disney's \\"The Country Bears\\". Is it any surprise that both films share the same plot elements (\\"I'm not like the rest of my family\\" + \\"We've got to save the theater!\\")?)?
B0042RUMEQ|4.0|Like Madonna and Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj acts like she has a male appendage. \\"If I had a di@k, I would pull it out and piss on 'em.\\" That's from Did It On 'Em.    When Nicki appeared at the end of Britney's Femme Fatale concert, I thought: \\"who's this crazy girl?\\"    On the cover, Nicki looks like a plastic armless Barbie with elongated legs. Is she the record industry's newest puppet, manipulated by hidden handlers? ([...]) I do enjoy her outrageous get ups, complete with that glazed look in her eyes.    As a whole, Pink Friday does contain very catchy, sparkling rhythms to accompany all those potty mouth banter. Minaj's more of a rapper than a singer, but this CD does showcase some good singing from her.    The version I have is the UK Super Bass Edition. I particularly enjoyed Girls Fall Like Dominoes and Super Bass - these  bonus tracks are not on the US standard edition. Annie Lennox's No More I Love Yous is sampled on Your Love - to great effect.    I could not stop laughing at Roman's Revenge - ruff ruff dungeons and dragons?!    Pink Friday is mindless fun. Rap and Hip Hop are not my staples but I can easily listen to this from start to finish without skipping songs. Where this release is concerned, there are a plethora of versions out there. So do browse around for the track list that you fancy.
B004LZF2LW|4.0|It's a cool app but the app requires the Maps app to run in the background which drains the battery. I lost 14% of battery in only half an hour.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|I like being able to display the times of multiple places around the world of the people I communicate with in a neat and small area. BUT, I am trying blindly as the typing area is covered up by my keyboard. To who ever is responsible for the review typing area, I don't need to see a pic of the clock, how many reviews, and sold by amazon while I'm typing, but I do need to see the typing area and keyboard.

B005EGXTEE|3.0|Fascinated by the hype the film's opening generated, and the fact that my 13 year old (boy) stated 'the books are the best and I cant wait to see the film' I decided to find out myself what all the fuss is about.<br />Three books later, and after several intense conversations with those (adults) who have seen the film (I have not), I find myself faced with the dilemma - Is this review of a childrens' series? Is it a review of a political and social veiled commentary? Is it a review of an adults series? I am unsure. The story centers around a 'country/world' (it is never clear), where a ruthless regime (aspects of which bear a striking resemblance to North Korea, Burma and recent events in Syria), maintain control through fear, manipulation, cruelty and hunger. However adults in this story play either a villianous or secondary role, children are the regimes main targets, source of opposition, heros (perhaps) and victims.<br /><br />As an adult and a parent I found this both distressing and confusing. Joseph Kony and other african warlords have obviously inspired the author.  But to the story! The evil regime having faced an uprising in the past has determined that every year each district must select two children to represent them in The Hunger Games. The world of the Hunger Games is divided into the 'Capitol' (evil, controlling, home of the president, materialistic and most definately not hungry) and the districts each with a singular purpose (farming, mining, manufacturing) that have varying population levels and are portrayed as basically concentration camps where the population is starved, beaten and controlled by the ruthless armies (peacekeepers) of the 'Capitol'. The games themselves are gladitorial. Each child goes into a man made world with the sole aim of killing every other child, and thus achieving both victory, survival and food. Of course none of this can happen until each child is groomed and paraded around to the citizens of the capitol, who obviouslyhave no issue with media manipulation, child abuse and child murder. Oliver Stone in Natural Born Killers parodied a similiar media obsession.<br /><br />Our protagonist 'Katniss' is a 17 year old female from District 12, portrayed as one of the hungriest camps, in fact Katniss' greatest skill is creeping out of the confines of her camp to hunt successfully (with a bow and arrow) for food, many in her camp/district are in her debt for keeping them alive. Obviously Katniss is selected for the games. I wont give away the ending in the first book or in fact at the end of the third but it is as unexpected as expected. Themes of hunger are well represented and food and its consumption fill great numbers of pages, as do the author's annoying habit of spending many pages flashing back on Katniss' memories, the only purpose for this appears to be the desire to reiterate (over and over again) the rationale for her behaviour. Because despite the situation she finds herself in, the supporting characters and her past she is hard to like or understand.<br /><br />The Hunger Games if more subtle and better written could have been a truly great trilogy for adults. If fewer complex themes, more behavioural analysis, well rounded characters and a purposeful blackness and futility had been applied it could have been a series worth series academic and educational attention. It is neither, adults who have seen the film are appalled at the violence and premise (these adults are not wowsers). My own reaction? Shock. Shock that these books resonate with our children and shock that there has been no real discussion regarding the themes and events portrayed in them.
0316044938|3.0|I read this book with great expectations, and I have to say I was a little disappointed. I expected much more.I don't know if I want to think of my deceased loved one's lurking about, unless, of course, they have unfinished business. The MC in this story definitely had unfinished business, but was never allowed to finish it. It really ruined the whole story for me. Perhaps if she'd been able to help in some way, it would have made a difference, but as it was, the story fell completely flat.This book disagreed with me so much, I refused to even watch the movie. I give it 3 stars because the writing is impeccable. I give 3 stars to the brilliant editing and 1 star for the lack-luster story.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I LOVE this app. For the past couple of days, however,  I'm unable to open pictures from my gallery. The screen dims as if it's loading, but nothing happens. I am able to open recently used pictures, though. Is anyone else having this problem?

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I loved the Swedish version and thought Rapace was perfect Lisbeth so I was very reluctant to the idea of an American version with Rooney Mara in the lead. She is every bit as good as Rapace, an amazing achievement. And Daniel Craig is great as Blomkvist, a very understated performance, which is how the character is portrayed in the novels. Supporting cast is excellent.<br />But the film itself is a work of art. It is gorgeous to watch, the detail, the movement, the flow from scene to scene. This is a film that should be shown in film school on how to direct a film. And how to act in a film.<br />Yeah, there are a few scenes hard to watch. I don't know about anyone else SPOILERS but I find the scene were Lisbeth is tied up and raped to be one of the most disturbing I have ever seen. But it is important in understanding the character and the world in which she lives. The book, of course, is able to explore this much more thoroughly but I do admire how much they put into this film.<br />For me, this is the best film of 2011.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very fun and addictive to play. smooth fluid movements makes it even more enjoyable. I recommend it for every one.
0385535139|1.0|For starters you'll hire a drunk person? This was on the first pages. The problem was that this \\"plastered\\" lawyer without any experience take a huge case and... if I write it it'll be a spoiler. The first appointment the first day he is in his new job he has to pay $200.00 bucks just because? Or he goes out of the bar without paying? But getting to the first pages. He got drunk like a skunk and her wife said... nothing. You're married? Maybe your wife loves you or doesn't but either way when you go missing one day because your drunk she'll be wrathful at you for at least... too much time.<br /><br />I can go further in the plot's blunders but I really don't want to waste my time.

Just a note, the first time I saw the cover, I thought it was Tommy Lee on the front...look closely and you'll see what I mean. =]

0345535421|5.0|As a general rule, I am not fond of fantasy \\"trilogies\\" which, regardless of whether they're three books, four books or more, are often driven more by commercial considerations than creative needs.  Many of these tales could be told in one volume but have been bloated to more because later volumes will have a built-in audience.  This is not the case with A Song of Ice and Fire, more popularly known as The Game of Thrones books.  This is a big story that requires several volumes and several thousand pages to tell.<br /><br />A Clash of Kings is the second volume in this saga, taking up where the preceding book (A Game of Thrones) left off.  The story opens with the appearance of a comet.  It appears to be an omen, but of what?  Each side in the civil war that is erupting has its own interpretation.<br /><br />The central family in this story is the Starks.  At the beginning of the novel, Robb Stark, the teenage son of the late Stark patriach Ned, has become King of the North, at war with the \\"official\\" king Joffrey (backed by the Lannister clan) and the rival claimants to the throne, the previous king's brothers, Renly and Stannis.  Robb (who despite being a pivotal character, hardly appears in the book and has no chapters with his point-of-view) battles the Lannisters.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Stannis and Renly compete with each other, while Robb's mother Catelyn tries to broker alliances.  Meanwhile, Robb's sister Sansa is trapped in the capital city of King's Landing, the hostage of Joffrey's family.  Meanwhile, Robb's young brothers Bran and Rickon act as figurehead rulers of the Stark home of Winterfell.  Meanwhile, Robb's half-brother Jon explores the land beyond the Wall, where strange creatures dwell and bring the dead back as zombie killers.  Meanwhile, Theon Greyjoy, the former ward of the Starks tries to prove he's a worthy heir to his real father.  Meanwhile, Daenerys, the heir to a previous, usurped king, plots from exile her rise to power.  Meanwhile, a new monotheistic (and intolerant) religion threatens the polytheistic old ones (and shows some parallels to the rise of early Christianity).<br /><br />That's a lot of \\"meanwhiles\\" and I think I missed one or two.  This is a complex story and you would not want to start reading it with this volume.  But if you head volume one in this series and enjoyed it, you will be equally pleased with this one.

B006ISJQ26|1.0|I had high hopes for this after reading some decent reviews. What a shambles this film is. A decent cast all fail to provide anything worth sticking with.<br />What a long two hours this was listening to Colin Farrell's awful Cockney accent. The story is boring and has far too much swearing, even for a gangster film.<br />Don't bother with this. there are far better films out there!

The product description didn't mention a CD, so I wasn't expecting one...however, I didn't expect a big, non-removable sticker on the front cover with an empty pocket on the inside.  (I ended up burning my own CD to include, as this was a gift.)
B00447G2PM|1.0|The biggest complaint I've seen from others is that the narration is too quiet to hear over the music, and that the movie is too short.  It's true, the narration is so bad that you have to crank up the volume to the point your ears bleed to make out what they are saying.  And as for being short, you won't leave it in long enough to find out how long it lasts.  COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY !!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished reading all five books in the Wool Omnibus Edition and I have to say, Hugh Howey is going to be an authorial force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />Forget the sci-fi genre, this is a work of social fiction that is equal anything from William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, or Neal Stephenson. Howey's universe is rendered in a style that would make Cormac McCarthy uncomfortable. His characters are alive and motivated and even his supporting cast members have a pulse.<br /><br />Howey's minimalist prose draws the reader in and makes this series a book one literally cannot put down and a work of fiction that should be required reading.<br /><br />I am looking forward to seeing what comes next from Mr Howey, well done indeed.

0345803485|3.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />So, I caved to the hype and read this book.  It is written like this is EL James' own personal fantasy she attempted to turn into a 3 book series.  I read the first book, and am struggling through the second.  I'm reading more for curiousity than enjoyment..and I am skimming, a lot.<br /><br />Other reviewers are spot on with the repetiveness and ridiculousness of it all.  I don't even know if I'll read the third book, becuase I am so tired of the following phrases:<br /><br />blush<br />Holy Crap<br />Holy Cow<br />Jeez<br />inner goddess (and the lame gymnastic/ice skating references that go along with it)<br />We aim to please, Ms. Steele (or Mr. Grey)<br /><br />...and others I know I'm forgetting.<br /><br />While I can apprecitate this is fiction and is labeled as erotica, I didn't even find it believable for a 22 year old virgin to go from that to near completely accepting of the BDSM lifestyle in a matter of days/weeks.  It would have been more believable had Ana's (oh, I'm sorry, Anastasia, or Ms. Steele's) character had some experience or wasn't so innocent--I guess that's where EL James' fantasy comes in--a total innocent being defiled and spoiled rotten.<br /><br />The only reason I can think of that people compare this to the Twilight books (which was more crap..yet I read it) was there was this obsessive mutual attraction that was never really explained..almost a fatal attraction, I guess--I can only compare it to when I was a 14 year old freshman obsessively in love with a senior for no other reason than I thought he was \\"totally cute.\\"--that alone was enough for me to drive by his house at night, honking the horn, and showing up where he worked.  Trust me--I'm over it!<br /><br />The editing was clearly lacking as well---way too many obscure British terms (the author is British) made their way into the book--and the book(s) take please in Washington State.  Someone also didn't do their homework, because like other reviewers,I was also confused when they drove through Portland to get to Vancouver...whaaaat?!<br /><br />Quite frankly, the first book was annoying, and reading the second book is annoying, and I don't even know if I'll finish it.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is not a \\"cancer\\" book. Yes, it features 16 year olds with cancer, but that is not what this book is essentially about. The topic of cancer is important in the sense that it was used to drive the story and its characters, and if anything, it only got us - as readers - more easily attached to them. It shaped the characters into who they are and what they become and it made us, the readers, more emotionally invested in them. You know what's going to happen from the very first page, but it is no less heartbreaking when it does.<br /><br />Hazel is a 16 year old who loves reading, trashy TV, her family and ultimately Augustus. Hazel has terminal thyroid cancer which has taken over her lungs to the point where an oxygen tank becomes a permanent accessory. During one of the weekly cancer support groups, she meets Augustus - a 16 year old who has lost his leg in a battle with a malignant leg tumor. Together, these two characters had the most incredible blend of sarcastic wit and literary conversations that there was absolutely no getting away from it - I fell in love.<br /><br />I knew I was going to have a major book crush on Augustus when he immediately, upon being introduced to Hazel, told her she was beautiful and looked like Nathalie Portman from V for Vendetta. That crush got bigger when he complained about the wrong use of the word \\"literally\\".<br /><br />Death is a theme in this book, losing people you know or love, dealing with it then moving on. It makes you think about the courage it takes to move on after a parent loses his or her child, about the life you've spent, about how much you have left of it, about the value of living it to the fullest.<br /><br />The characters were so real, as John Green usually makes them, that I had to put the book down several times and just breathe and remind myself that they weren't. And even though they might not be real, the situation definitely is. This book made me laugh, it made me think, and it made me cry in huge heaving sobs of despair and heartbreak. I knew what was going to happen, but it still shocked me to no end. It all felt so unfair, so unreal...I almost wanted to write Green an email ranting to him about his choice of plot twist.<br /><br />When I finished the book - very late at night - I \\"literally\\" curled up in bed and sobbed into my pillow. I could relate to the heartbreak, because I have personally been through it.<br /><br />Thank you John Green for being such a great writer. Thank you for giving us such great material to read and reminding us of the value of life in every book you write. I cannot recommend this book enough to people - and no, not only Young Adults fans.<br /><br />I'm ending this with something a reviewer said that I could not agree with more, \\"thank you, John Green, for ruining the next few books I read.\\"me cry in huge heaving sobs of despair and heartbreak.

0765350386|5.0|Brandon Sanderson's \\"Mistborn\\" is a fantastic epic fantasy novel.  The story revolves around a world where a select few people hold the power to gain strength, heightened senses, and greater mobility, by the manipulating of certain metals.  These people are known as Allomancers and our main characters Vin and Kelsier are both \\"Mistborn\\" the more powerful of the allomancers.  These two along with their band of thieves undertake a massive plot to overthrow the lord ruler - a absolute authority who claims to be both \\"God\\" and immortal and who has ruled the planet for thousands of years.<br />Sanderson's world is very interesting from page one and his magic system is unlike anything I've read before.  He does an admirable job of explaining the way alomancy works without making it sound like a fictitious history lesson.  The book is no quick read coming in around 650 pages....even still, it is expertly paced, keeping the reader turning pages well into the night.  The ending is satisfying enough that had this book been a \\"stand alone\\" read, you wouldn't have been disappointed.  Fortunately it's part of a series and I for one am looking forward to getting into the second book \\"Mistborn: The Well of Ascension\\".<br />For anyone who enjoys a good fantasy novel, this is a great read and well worth your time and money.

The graph he uses to show major rises in carbon dioxide levels were most extreme in our very far past, but he overlooks that and says it is now happening.

1741798981|5.0|LONDON 2012 by Harper, Fallon, Filou, and Schafer, is a 464-page guidebook, with non-glossy pages, and a large pull-out color map showing features such as RIVER THAMES, BUCKINGHAM PALACE, IMPERIAL WAR MUSEUM, SHAKESPEARE'S GLOBE, GOLDEN HINDE, BRITISH MUSEUM, MUSEUM OF EGYPTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY, BRITISH LIBRARY, and TOWER OF LONDON, where all of these things are within walking distance of each other, that is, from 1 to 3 miles apart.  Golden Hinde is only a replica of Francis Drake's ship (page 170).  Mr.Drake is known for discovering one of the most beautiful spots in California, namely, Drake's Bay, located just north of San Francisco.  Shakespeare's Globe was reconstructred about 200 meters from the original site, and it was funded by an American, Sam Wanamaker (page 168).  What the guidebook fails to state, is that the money actually came from Samuel Scripps (1927-2007), who was a member of the Scripps family (Scripps Institute in San Diego, CA), and who had worked behind the scenes at various Shakespeare festivals in America, e.g., in Berkeley, Riverside, and New York.  The Imperial War Museum is detailed on page 276, where we learn that it is located in a former hospital, and that it includes a German V-2 rocket, a Sherman tank, spying equipment, and a Spitfire airplane.  Tower of London, the highpoint of all London, is described (pages 141-146), and we learn that it was built in 1078, and includes crown jewels, scaffolds where many famous people spent time hanging around, and exhibitions in the White Tower.<br /><br />New, let us turn from the features of the pull-out map, to the color photos.  There is a color photo or color map, at a frequency of about one every 5 to 6 pages.  The photos include a dinosaur inside Natural History Museum (page 10), Westminster Abbey (page 12), changing of the guard (page 22), British Museum (page 39), display of little cakes at Ottolenghi (a deli) (page 46), more little cakes at Bea's of Bloomsbury (a tiny cafe) (page 48), interiors of two jewelry stores (page 69), Palace of Westminster (page 90), five photos from VICTORIA & ALBERT MUSEUM, showing costumes, religious statues, and a jewelry box (page __), and garden at Hampton Court Palace (page 293).  All the photos were carefully chosen.  There are no useless pictures (useless, in my opinion), for example, useless pictures of beds on hotels, or useless pictures that are close-ups of flowers).  It might be noted that the frequency of photos is less in this guidebook than, for example, in most of the FODOR'S guidebooks (well, so be it, that can't be helped).  The book is not really divided into chapters, but instead, the book is divided into various sections, each from 2-pages long to about 20-pages long, having titles such as: (1) The West End; (2) The City; (3) The South Bank; (4) Kensington & Hyde Park; (5) Clerkenwell; (6) Shoreditch & Spitalfields; (7) The East End & Docklands; and so on.<br /><br />To sample a bit of the writing, here is a quote about a hotel called ROOKERY (page 322): \\"This absolute charmer is a warren of 33 rooms that has been built within a row of 18th century Georgian houses and fitted out with antique furniture, including original wood paneling, statues in bathrooms, and artworks, there's a small courtyard garden.\\"<br /><br />The most appropriate part of this guidebook, and one that distinguishes this guidebook from most other guidebooks, is the TIMELINE (page 344-361).  The book needs a timeline, and it does in fact have a timeline, because the science, technology, and law of much of the Western civilization was derived from innovations coming from England.  (To give one small example, PATENT LAW, in its modern form, came from the Statute of Monolpolies, and English statute from 1623.)  The TIMELINE provides highlights from the years 43AD to 2011BC, and we learn about the Romans, King Alfred the Great, William the Conqueror, King John (the villain of the Robin Hood stories, and source of inspiration for the MAGNACARTA, presently displayed at BRITISH LIBRARY).  BRITISH LIBRARY is detailed on pages 235-236, and we learn that it also contains a real Gutenberg Bible, Captain Scott's diary, manuscripts by Thomas Hardy, Shakespeare, Lewis Carrol, original scores by Beethoven, and handwritten lyrics by The Beatles.  The TIMELINE also shows Westminster Abbey, built during the time of William the Conqueror's reign.  The TIMELINE has small photos corresponding to many of the events or buildings erected, as history unfolded itself.  WESTMINSTER ABBEY is detailed on pages 80-82, and we see a half-page photo of the building, and learn that most of the kings of England were crowned here.  Its architecture is \\"Early English Gothic\\" (1180-1280).  The guidebook also tells us that the grounds of the ABBEY include, e.g., Chapter House, Pyx Chamber, Abbey Museum, Poet's Corner, and Isaac Newton's Tomb.  The TIMELINE also discloses the 45-year reign of Elizabeth I (a time when religeous tolerance began to take hold), and when the British defeated the Spanish Armada (1588), and we learn the dates of the great plagues (1348 & 1665) and of the Great Fire (1666).  The potential tourist who reads the timeline, will hopefully be inspired to purchase a book on each of the topics disclosed, and in this way, will be able to actually understand the buildings, palaces, and monuments, that are viewed during his or her vacation in London.<br /><br />The TIMELINE (page 357) shows a small picture of ST.PAUL'S CATHEDRAL, noted for surviving Nazi bombing.  ST.PAUL'S CATHEDRAL is detailed on pages 147-149, and there is a 1/2-page photo of its dome, a color map of its floor plan, and we learn that it had been completed in 1710, and that a guided tour takes you to the \\"Geometric Staircase,\\" Chapel of St.Michel, the Whispering Gallery, Stone Gallery, and Golden Gallery, and we learn that the architect was Christopher Wren.<br /><br />Back to the TIMELINE, and turning to the topic of sports, we learn that in 1966, England beat Germany at WEMBLY STADIUM (page 358).  Other parts of the book details various stadiums, e.g., Wembly Stadium, Twickenham Stadium, The Oval (cricket stadium), Lord's Cricket Ground (another cricket stadium), and Wimbledon, and we learn that Wimbledon includes a windmill, tea room, and tennis museum (see pages 72-73, 239, 255, 280, 287, and 302, for sports).<br /><br />To conclude, I believe that this guidebook mainly concerns a small part of London, that is, central London, and only select spots of interest in this area.  There are tons of things that were, by necessity, left out, for example, the beautiful architecture of City Hall in Southwark.  The interested traveler reading this guideook will likely find herself or himself to be pleasantly overwhelmed by the dense concentration of tourist attractions in London.

B0007CNXUU|4.0|Last night's movie was exceptionally well done. It was \\"Finding Neverland\\" starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. The photography was excellent. The settings were magnificent. The musical score was excellent The acting was quite good, if you like the stiff British style. I can think of a lot of good things to say about this movie. And I note at the bottom of the DVD case that it was labeled \\"Best Picture of the Year\\" by the National Board of Review, whatever that is.<br /><br />Well, I just didn't particularly care for the movie, well done though it was. The film was long, very slow moving, almost glacial in it's pace, and, in a word, boring. I just never could get into the story. After a while, I kept looking at my watch wondering when it would be over. Then I started getting up to get things without putting it on pause. Then I stopped it for a while and went out to check my email on the computer. It was that kind of movie for me. Okay, I'll take the blame. All you need to do is look at the ratings and comments to see that many others loved it. It's a well-done movie, without question. By all means check it out and read a lot of the better reviews. You may love it. Then again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I just skimmed the one-star reviews decrying the messing with of a classic. When I rented this I was skeptical and thought I was going to be among that group as I was just a very young - under 21 - adult for the first go-around.  I've seen what Hollywood can do to a classic TV show like Dukes of Hazzard and also The Brady Bunch and some remakes of other movies have been less than decent.  So I was not about to plunk down my hard-earned at Walmart money to see basically a \\"High School Musical\\" or \\"Glee\\" dumb-down of this in the theater.<br />  I have to say that I was impressed at the faithfulness this rework exercised - like a great cover of a favorite song.  While the time-frame of the story is set in the present time, it's the same.  I like how they revisit some of the original music of the 1984 but give it a new twist.  The acoustic rendition of \\"Holding Out For A Hero\\" was superb.  Also I like a few of the changes for some of the scenes such as the racing of the school buses in place of the chicken game with the farm tractors, the dance at the drive-in instead of the hamburger joint and the dance lesson scenes for the cowboy kid were adorable. Making changes like these does not diminish the movie in anyway, there is not need to make a carbon copy, no more than Whitney trying to make a country version of \\"I Will Always Love You\\", her rendition captures the spirit of that song.<br />  While the original movie is still and always will be my classic, there are some elements that give this version an advantage over the original:<br /><br />The Opening: The tragic car wreck and what led up to it and the subsequent laws that were passed as a result.  Here we see that the laws being passed in the wake of the tragedy came from love and genuine concern for the well-being of the adolescents from a heart-broken community.<br /><br />The Court Scene: The concern stemming from the heartbreak from the loss is once again communicated by the preacher  when Ren wants to appeal against the no-dancing law.  The original movie paints the adults as oppressive and uncaring toward the youth because you don't see that love and concern that spawned the law, also the committee are rather condescending with Ren in the original.  In this remake, the preacher sounds empathetic and sensitive to what Ren is asking for.  Overall, the court scene in the remake is rendered much better in my opinion.<br /><br />Preacher/Daughter Showdown Scene:  Here we see that the daughter is not merely being a rebel, she - like her mother - are frustrated by him, that because of losing his son he is over doing it in trying to protect her to the point that he is basically smothering her.<br /><br />Preacher and Ren Scene:  Finally Ren's asking the preacher if he can take his daughter to the dance that was going to happen anyway in the neighboring town since Bomont was to remain a no-dance town. Here we see the preacher and the person he considers his enemy beginning to see eye to eye.<br /><br />I like how this movie - though depicting the typical \\"teenage rebellion\\" and showing drinking of alcohol and explicit dancing, I feel it's conveys the message that it isn't espousing such behavior but showing how it can lead to bad consequences - the accident - and that while adolescents may want to \\"act stupid\\" as Ren said in the courtroom, there is a way to do it without harming yourself.  The movie also - like the original - espouses that parents and adults concerned about adolescents have to find that balance where you can set boundaries to protect them but not so much you are stiffing them and even giving them a reason to fight against you.<br /><br />Congratulations on a job well done.ainst the no-dancing law.

1612130283|3.0|Admitted Twilight fan fiction, Fifty Shades of Grey has slammed to the top of bestseller lists with absolutely no intentional, targeted advertising. It is literally a book that has gone viral, something rarely heard of. Yet this book is frankly cheese and full of dramatic cliches. Its only appeal is that it mimics the characters of Twilight while engaging them in taboo antics. To thousands of women, that is all the appeal it needs.

0439023513|1.0|While I knew that the tone of the books bacame steadily darker as they progressed, nothing could have prepared me for the dismal ending of this book.<br /><br />In other words, the ending of this book left you with nothing of the feelings that make an ending memorable, fulfilling, and satisfying for the one reading it. After making an exhausting journey with Katniss, where you constantly experienced her fears, doubts, tribulations, and all sorts of dark feelings that were forever engulfing our heroine, I was hoping for the ending that would finally lay all the injustice of Panem to rest. Which leads me to say, that Katniss Everdeen was absolutely no hero in this last novel. There is nothing of that strong individual who took her sister's place in the hunger games  and won them. Instead, we become acquainted with this fragile and \\"mentally disoriented\\" individual who can barely be tolerated throughout the book.<br /><br />All the good things that happen through the book (few as they are), become completely worthless by the deaths of all the people involved in it. There is literally no breath of fresh air throuout this novel. The whole plot is a maelstrom of angsty feelings, desesperation, and just carelessness in Katniss's part. I was sick by the number of times she coldly calculated killing Peeta, the guy who loved her unconditionally throughout the first two books. As soon as she finds out he no longer holds her in that pedestal of perfection and love due to his being hijacked, she treats him with all the cruelty and disdain she can master.<br /><br />But my biggest dissapointed was the fact that everything ended as it had begun. Whereas before we learnt of the injustice of the Hunger Games and Katniss' feelings about them, and despite Katniss showing us that she views the people of the capitol as children who just want to be entertained, she AGREES to have the Hunger Games imposed on the children of the capitol. Can't she know that children are children, despite of privileged background? At this moment in the book I just found her utterly repulsive. Oh, and the whole Gale or Peeta romance thing? A simple anecdote in the last five pages of the book. Who cares that she got married and had kids when you could tell she literally didnt care for them?! You could not feel her love for Peeta, and while she mentions doting on her two kids, she could also be talking about the bread cheese that she was so fond of eating.<br /><br />Even the writing did little to redeem the plot of this novel. I was sick of the many time skips and blackout where Katniss would wake in a hospital not knowing what the heck had happened.<br />I hate that I downloaded this book in my nook and if there was a delete option in my library this whole series will go right to the trash bin.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|Very nicely designed. At first, it looks complicated, but after using it for 5 minutes, it became intuitive. The world map is a nice eye candy, but unnecessary.
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|If you like Mission Impossible, I think you will enjoy what I consider something as a spoof of that movie.  Though this movie gets pretty much into unconvincing territory, that is what can be seen a being part of the spoof element.  How in the world are a small band of people who are not experienced at so much as shoplifting going to rob a highrise that is next to being like Fort Knox?<br />  I enjoyed this movie for what it was - a comedy/action flick....and another thing, the writers did not feel the need to insert an irrelevant love scene.  That seems to be pretty much a standard for movies and it has been worn to death.  I was expecting one to ensue when the one guy hits it off with an FBI agent.  That's all this guy who is about to commit his first major crime needs!!!!  I love that nothing came of it.  The ending left something to be desired although the main guy basically sacrifices himself for the benefit of the rest of his gang of robbers and more so for his subordinates whom he was the head over, who had been defrauded out of their pensions by the person whom he had manage them.<br />  The story has it's holes but that just adds to the comedy.  Not the movie of the year but not as bad as some claim.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I think the general reaction to the third book that most people have, seems to agree with my reaction.  Not as good as the other two, looking at the star ratings seems to indicate this too.  Had I written this initially after finishing the last chapter and epilogue, I probably would have gone with 2 to 3 stars.  Now that I've had some time to think about it, I appreciate the ending better.  The start of the book struggled to keep me interested, it picked up in Part II for a while and again in Part III.  I didn't think some of the deaths were necessary to the story, and just seemed gratuitous, or in your face.  But my overall reaction to the book comes from the conclusion of the novel, and thereby conclusion of the Katniss story.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />My initial reaction was that the ending just falls flat.  There is no grand Disney-like ending where she finally comes to the realization she's been in love with Peeta the whole time, or anything like that.  Which is fine I suppose, although when she sees Peeta again I wanted to see her show some sort of excitement, maybe even rush out to him.  Especially since she (the author and katniss) drags him through the mud pretty much the whole novel. But now that I think about it more - this reaction is completely within her character.  She is not the fall in love head over heels type.  It is, though a very important moment at the end, because everything that happens there after is symbolic of their relationship.  It is from that moment on she stops \\"waiting\\" and starts to finally mourn Prim's death.  Remember, Prim was the beginning of the whole story; the whole reason that Katniss was in the hunger games and met Peeta officially.  In a lot of ways, the love story is more between the sisters.  Peeta is always the catalyst for hope and future, so now that he is back she can come to grips with the past years, mourning everyone that has died.  It is once she is past that phase that she can finally turn her attention to their relationship and future together.  Although, this whole part of the novel is only a few paragraphs and feels quite rushed, or as other reviewers put it, Collins seemed to just want to get it over with.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|Why every family in America doesn't have a copy of this in their collection is beyond me. So far, everyone I have mentioned this film to has never even heard of it!!! What's up with that??? I won't spoil it but just want to say that it's worth every penny!!! To see some of the cronie's that caused the financial crash reale in their seats when asked the questions is worth it all by itself!!! Amazing that no one ever went to jail over this, or were even hardly slapped on the wrist, and in fact most of them are still in power!!!! This is a learning experience and humorous at the same time!
0385534639|1.0|This book is very bad.  After trudging through 190 pages of syrupy and often times, redundant descriptions, I quit reading it in earnest because NOTHING had happened plot wise.  I don't mind reading through a few chapters of a book before the plot starts to take off, but if I am halfway through a book and NOTHING has happened, I am going to start wondering how much more of my time is going to be wasted plodding through confectionary prose that doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose.  The truly sad thing about this book, is that is seems to be written by a novice author with a promising premise, but appears to have suffered from VERY meager editing.  This seems to becoming a disturbing trend in publishing....first time authors with an interesting idea, but writing skills in need of assistance seem to be getting their work published without having it fully flushed out to make it reach its full potential (the Twilight books also come to mind).  The fact that this book seems to have been hastily marketed as the next big thing, and on par with Harry Potter ( which it most certainly is not), frankly, makes me angry at the publishing industry for wasting my money and my time.
B006OFN0SE|2.0|Leonardo DiCaprio's impressive performance cannot save \\"J. Edgar\\" (2011) from its dire mediocrity. Repeating the structural mistakes that plagued \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" Clint Eastwood's direction simply lacks focus. Working with a fragmented script by Dustin Lance Black, he resorts to confusing flashbacks and cross-cutting distractions. Eastwood never seems engaged in the Hoover saga except for the Lindbergh kidnapping and its aftermath. Not helping matters are the poor lighting, Armie Hammer's embarrassing old-age makeup, and the utter waste of Judi Dench. Though DiCaprio received an Oscar nomination for his detailed portrayal, he deserved a much better film.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|Ok, I have been watching Carpenter's version since 1982. Saw it at the theatre and fell in love with it from the start, but always wondered what happened to the Norwegians that started all of the drama... Went to see this pre-qual in the theatre's last year and was blown away by their attention to detail in tieing the two events together! Told my wife that as soon as this comes out on blue-ray, I'm buying it and watching BOTH films back to back to get the full experience. Well, I just did this last night and let me tell you, it was AWESOME!!!! They did such a good job on this film!!! And the extra features really help to explain some old questions from the original film.  If you loved the Carpenter version, you'll love this version!!! Be sure to watch them back to back, it's GREAT!!!! Hope they come out with a sequal next!!!! COOL!!!  10/07/2015 - UPDATE to this review: Just last night I once again watched this PREQUEL and immediately put in Carpenter's 1982 original. Every time I do this, it's a totally amazing experience! I'm still blown away at the GREAT JOB these folks did in creating the prequel! Some have stated that they wished they had not used CG etc. etc. etc. Well, first, it's important to know that in fact they mostly used highly sophisticated props. They only used CG to enhance certain areas where it simply made more sense to do so. I'd have to say that 80% of creature creations are props and NOT CG, based on the behind the scenes footage that comes with this disc. What really amazes me is that they used REAL flamethrowers! If anything probably should've been CG from a safety perspective, it probably should've been this area. BUT, as the creators state, CG flames suck! LOL!! So, there you have it ;) Also, lets face it, only old school people want to see analog. In order to keep in the running and make some $, the majority of the crowd that would go see a film like this today were not even born in 1982! So, from that perspective, you have to understand the business side of showbiz... However, it's clear that they tried to use as little CG as they could, and for that I thank them greatly, coming from an old school dude like myself ;) I think their job on the FX was high quality and superior in craftsmanship. The creature makers were of the level of Rick Baker, Dick Smith, Tom Sevini, etc. SUPER professionals and craftsmen!  I can totally see them do a sequel to these 2 films now, if they wanted to. They could tie in the girl from the prequel to the &#34;frozen&#34; corpses at the USA site... etc... totally can see this happening, and it would be correct if you think about it. And in truth, they could potentially even use the original actors from 82, cause those guys really have held up pretty well over the years ;) Could simply &#34;Thing&#34; one of them from the start, and move on to new characters ;) Hope they do!
B007M45XL8|5.0|This is the most interesting Dr. John record in my opinion since \\"Gris Gris\\". Though not a showcase of his piano chops as much as his 70's stuff, the songwriting and production is so good, its just incredible. The african beats make a great accompaniment to Dr. John's voice. I was hoping for something new from this album, and it really delivers. A couple of rock-oriented singles, like \\"Locked Down\\" but overall some really complex and awesomely rhythmic sound textures.<br /><br />I am a huge fan, as a native New Orleanian, and to be able to see the Dr. still laying down fonkyness at his age uplifts us all. Thanks to Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys for helping bring the Dr. back to where he needs to be, the Big Shot at the center of the NOLA universe!<br /><br />Buy this. You won't regret it.
B00701QVVY|5.0|On my first play through Ironbound I was blown away... it was like Overkill had suddenly decided to stomp down on the gas pedal and tear off at a redline.<br /><br />My concern was that perhaps after aforementioned album they'd run out of gas, slow down, and pace things down a notch for the next CD.<br /><br />Well, they didn't.  Absolute shredding blastfest.  Sure there are a few times when the pace slows a little bit, but overall, if you're looking for another heavy metal helping of aural excitement: welcome to the Electric Age.

B004S9AK9U|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. A different story about death. While it was about a murder it wasnt graphic. The fact that it was the victim telling the story of how her family coped with her death was different than the living telling the story.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I enjoyed the book until the middle chapter then it became repetitive....I guess it needed to but after awhile I didn't need to know all the different ways to kill someone.....but maybe I am too old for that. I then skipped to the last chapter because I could tell that the two main characters would live and I wanted to see how the author would play it out. I understood how the author was trying to show how the characters did what they could to keep their individuality but also go along with the status quo to survive. Not sure if I liked the ending but it did make sense for the lead in to the next book. I do think it is a new way of presenting the idea of Big Brother to the new generation. Such as using War games, Reality TV, Game Show, and soap opera storyline intertwined. I can see how it may appeal to teens/young adults. I also see how parents would completely disapprove of their teen reading it. Since there is so much descriptive violence some may fear it's influence. So in the end I would not really rave about it but would also not tell someone not to read it.  I would advise another parent to read the book first so they can discuss it with their teen. Will try the next book.
0525423281|5.0|Going in, I knew I would love this book because I loved Anna and the French Kiss. But gosh darn it, I really LOVED this book! No seriously. This book was amazing.<br /><br />The first reason I loved this book was Lola (aka Delores). She is such a spunky character who wears outrageous outfits. I'm so jealous of her style and how she is comfortable wearing whatever she wants. Her bedroom sounds amazing, with it's glitter, glitz, and organized chaos. I wasn't a big fan of Max and didn't really understand what Lola saw in him AT ALL, but I guess she only wanted to feel wanted. Besides her terrible taste in men (in terms of Max that is), Lola is such an amazing character and made me wish I was kind of like her. Her dads were awesome too (she was adopted by her Uncle and his boyfriend), and you could really tell they cared about her. Lola is surrounded by so many great people that I just wanted to jump in and live her life.<br /><br />But let's get to the real reason I loved this book. Cricket. I mean seriously, why can't someone as perfect as him move next door to me and fall madly in love with ME? He's cute, funny, caring, and he dresses well. He's always there for Lola, even if it means missing out on friends or projects. Cricket was just so patient when it came to waiting for Lola to get over her problems, but he never left. Yeah, he's perfect. PERFECT.<br /><br />You know what else added to this already amazing book? The fact that Anna and St. Clair were in it (from Anna and the French Kiss). They were SO adorable and helped Lola and Cricket figure out their own relationship throughout the book. We were able to see Anna and St. Clair actually together for an entire book and it was so gosh darn cute!<br /><br />So this book was over all amazing. If you haven't yet, READ IT NOW. And Anna and the French Kiss. If Stephanie Perkins writes another one, Lola and Cricket better be in it (sorry I spoiled that they get together but come on, you know you already knew it was going to happen, you just don't know how). What are you doing? Go pick this book up now!
0062073281|3.0|First Impressions: I'll admit that I'm not a huge fan of reality T.V. I've never watched The Hills or any of that stuff. I think I watched Jersey Shore one time, and once was more than enough. However, this isn't a reality show, so I'll judge the book by its own merits. I've read other books written by Lauren Conrad and they are all fun and well-written. I especially like the cover of this one since it makes me want a lollipop really bad.<br /><br />First 50 Pages: As far as entertainment value goes, this book has a lot of perks. Sort of like say, reading a reality show in book form. More than once I wondered how much of the story did Lauren pull from her own life. With that being said, if I hadn't of received this book for review, I probably would never have bought it myself. It's just not my type of thing and I wasn't super crazy in love with Lauren's other books to go and rush to pick up this book. I could tell right away that I was going to have some issues with The Fame Game, but I do have to say that Lauren's writing has improved enormously in this novel.<br /><br />Characters & Plot: This is a story about Madison Parker, who is a character that some people will know is in Lauren's other book series, L.A. Candy. Madison is given the opportunity to be on a new reality-based television show called The Fame Game. There are three other girls who will also be competing for their spot in Hollywood, named Kate, Carmen and Gaby. Four women in one household does not sound like a fun or pleasant time to me, but Madison is willing to do whatever she has to in order to rise to the top of the social ladder.<br /><br />Needless to say, it was drama everywhere you looked. All of the characters, with the exception of Kate, were pretty much as horrible as they come. There really isn't much of a plot line, and I'm just going to come out and say it. I hated the characters. The Fame Game is full to the brim with backstabbing, bitchy girls with too much money and not enough common sense. I couldn't relate to them when they would go and spend $300 dollars on a purse without blinking an eye, or with the constant designer name dropping spread throughout the entire book. Kate is the only redeeming person of the bunch and she is not even the main character. I could never hang out with girls like these without wanting to throw them in front of a bus. Except Kate, I would save her.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: I think this is going to be a love it or hate it type of book. I'm not sure if it was right for me, but I did find it to be entertaining. It's like a guilty pleasure kind of story with little substance, but fun to read. I would love to see Lauren write something else, maybe something more people will be able to relate to, and because I don't think she is a terrible writer. I guess time will tell!sense.

0439023521|3.0|Before I begin, I'll be the first to admit that I was expecting a lot, going into this. With all the hype surrounding the upcoming *The Hunger Games* movie and several members of my extended family gushing about how great the books are, I figured it would be amazing. Unfortunately, it just... wasn't.<br /><br />*The Hunger Games* is split into three parts: \\"The Tributes,\\" \\"The Games,\\" and \\"The Victor.\\" (Note: while there are also three novels in the series, I am speaking only of the first novel, which is itself divided into the aforementioned parts.) What's interesting is that while many books increase in intensity from start to finish, this one is more like a bell curve. Part I (comprising chapters 1-9) begins a bit slowly, as it necessarily lays the groundwork for the story ahead. This, of course, is to be expected, and by the end of Part I, I had come to know and love the main protagonist. As Part II (chapters 10-18) begins, I was finally fully engaged in the story, and I loved every minute of it, constantly clamoring for more.<br /><br />But then I got to Part III.<br /><br />I'm not sure what was going through Suzanne Collins' mind as she wrote the third and concluding part of this novel, but it is, in a word, boring. It is so bad that there were several times I was about to close the book for good, and just not waste my time seeing how it ended. Still, I persevered, confident that since so many people think it's so great, there had to be something worthwhile at the end, something that would make this tremendous monotony worth it. The problem is: there isn't.<br /><br />After slogging through almost 100 pages of boredom, I finally arrived at the climax of the novel, only to be presented with a ridiculous, contrived, final battle that wasn't even exciting while it happened. And then, once it was finally over and I got to enjoy the results, there are still another 30 pages of slogging boredom before I finally read \\"END OF BOOK ONE\\"--as if I'd actually subject myself to two more novels of this.<br /><br />I realize, of course, that I'm not in the \\"young adult\\" target audience, but I enjoy several other novels of that genre. \\"Young Adult\\" doesn't necessarily mean \\"catering to tweenage pop culture,\\" but the climax was definitely just that.<br /><br />I'd also like to point out one of my three stars is because *The Hunger Games* is completely and utterly devoid of adult language and sexual situations, a feature I wish were found in more of modern literature. Even one of my favorite books of all time, *Ender's Game*, doesn't have that feature.<br /><br />So, all in all, a book that really failed to impress, but that I might read again, someday, at least in part. I'd still love to know what other people find so compelling, and maybe I'll find it on the second reading.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|Beautifully done. Simple, intuitive, smooth. The interface is great and it works. What more could I ask for? Would gladly pay for this app.
0553801473|3.0|I have greatly enjoyed this series up until this point, the first three books I adored and while I thought Feast for Crows was slightly disappointing from my favorite characters not being in it, i found it very interesting and compelling and things actually happened.<br /><br />Ok, I'll start with the pluses. The characters are still extremely well written, well rounded, and all around believable in their actions and motivations. The multitude of plots seem to be condensing and moving towards several central hubs of activity and there are finally indications that the big looming threat might actually be about to occur and people in the book are finally starting to take it seriously. Also, there is far less graphic sex in this book. Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings, and Storm of Swords had the scenes of sex make sense, the informing and formative moments for the characters and virtually all made sense in the narrative. Feast for Crows, however, got rather pointlessly gratuitive at times, so I am glad that Martin seems to have heard the complaints of this and toned it down to Game of Thrones level of actually being important and character defining.<br /><br />Now for the negatives, my biggest complaint about the book is that so many of the characters, though still well written, just seem to spin their wheels. The previous four books characters, P.O.V. especially but others as well, learned from their mistakes and experiences(or at the very least changed because of them), they moved and they grew in sensible ways, that was the biggest triumph of the previous books. In this book, many characters just seem to go on and on and on about the same thing and regardless of what happens, they don't change or grow, they just sort of spin their wheels like they are stuck in the mud. This relates to the second problem which is that until the last 200 pages of the book, very little happens, there is lots and lots of talking and debate, usually the same ones every time the same P.O.V. character came back up, but nothing actually gets done. This is saying something especially with the Wall storyline, in which despite it being dead obvious that something is coming, the reaction of some people to the threat is essentially to stick their head in the mud and argue the same points of(essentially) protocol and don't actually do much of anything.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book is that on reaching the end of it I can honestly say that for the first time I don't even want to venture a guess of where the plot is going or how things are going to end up. I am all for keeping things a secret but I am so completely in the dark of what is going on that I am honestly not sure that Martin himself actually knows what the endgame is anymore. The problem, I think stems from the fact that the characters long ago seem to have taken over the story and rather than altering the plot to make it fit with how the characters have turned out, the plot seems to be back with a vengeance and is now at 'war' so to speak with the character arcs.<br /><br />On final note of annoyance, for me, is that Martin has to know by now that the writing of this is moving a good deal slower than he ever planned(he has admitted as much) and if he wants to take breaks to work on other projects, well, as far as I am concerned that is his prerogative, but with all of that in mind he STILL has several big, dramatic cliffhanger endings which made me very frustrated on getting to the end since I know I'll have to wait YEARS to see the resolution.<br /><br />Final Summation: The book is well written and the characters are still good, but honestly I was bored by large parts of it and it seems like not much happens and nothing really changes.

The chapters alternate points of view.  The first WG is struggling with his group of friends after committing some social faux pas; meanwhile, his best friend Tiny is producing a play for their school based on his own, very gay life.  The second WG is a loner from another school district who also has few friends, is gay, and is in love with his online boyfriend Isaac.  But disaster strikes when he goes to meet his boyfriend offline for the first time.<br /><br />I LOVED this book!  It was funny, witty, and charming.  I absolutely loved the alternating points of view in this case.  Not only did that keep the story fresh, but it kept me reading, wanting to know what would happen next to my favorite WG.  When I first started WG,WG, I was most intrigued by the first Will's story.  But as the novel went on, I was really drawn in by the second Will's story and that's the one I was most invested in by the end of the novel, which ended... very... well you'll have to see for yourself because this is a must read book.<br /><br />It's a five star book, folks.  This book was published in 2010, so you very well may have already read this, but if you haven't hopped on the WG,WG train or the John Green train yet, it's time you do.
B005LAIHKY|5.0|Tim Burton has directed one of his finest works in years with his revival of the 1960's cult-classic soap opera \\"Dark Shadows\\". In this film Johnny Depp stars as Barnabas Collins, who, like in the original soap opera, awakens after 200 years from his coffin to find things have changed drastically around him. This is as far as the film goes with its resemblance to the series. What Burton has done is make a film that is a comedy, campy motion picture that is aimed for 2012 audiences. I am sure that people will love the movie as Burton is known for his somewhat strange approach to movie making, however fans of the beloved soap opera, like me, will be sad to see that the dramatic elements of the soap opera are not here and that the movie plays for laughs.<br /><br /> Johnny Depp gives a good performance as Barnabas, although I am not crazy about his make-up. He's funny, at times stupid and simply a caricature of the real Barnabas, but he's great playing a funny part. In the film Barnabas comes back to life in 1972 shocked to see how his world has changed and to see his latest members of his family. He also runs into the witch that put a curse on him 200 years before and they somehow get together again. Barnabas also helps out his family with financial trouble as they try to rebuild their empire.<br /><br /> I really love the special effects the movie employs, something the soap opera had a hard time to do on their tight network budget. If your looking for a fun time and a good laugh \\"Dark Shadows\\" with Johnny Depp will make you hysterical. But if your looking for a movie that is dramatic and close to the original ABC series you will be disappointed. Still, I am grateful the movie, opening in theatres May 11th, 2012, has brought a renewed interest in the soap opera and that an entire new generation of people who don't know about the Collins family or Branabas or Angelique will want to know how these characters got their start.<br /><br /> The movie became a solidified hit on opening weekend coming in at #2 with a whopping $28 million dollars at the box office in North America alone. Together with its international gross the film made nearly $70 million.t on opening weekend coming in at #2 with a whopping $28 million dollars at the box office in North America alone.

I was entranced,and intrigued that people other than the Poms were producing such great music, only to be hidden from the world. I found, in a tiny shop in my home city, this and Uomo di Pezza soon afterwards. So different. Later, I was tempted to buy the English language version, but as an impecunious student, thought better of it. Forty years later, that decision was vindicated. What induced them to get Peter Hammill to write some unrelated gobbledigook, and append it to the instrumentals?  Heavens to Betsy...Anglophones have listened to non English vocals for centuries. This offering contains both versions.<br /><br />The original Felona e Sorona is mostly a sublime dip into what Italian Prog could produce at its best. This dusting off  is excellent, and sounds much as I recall it. Crisp production, good sonic balance, and ambience, and the work itself all fits together.<br /><br />Le Orme were keyboard and percussion based, though the small guitar parts are perfectly competent. However, unlike ELP and other Keys based Prog outfits, the keys don't overwhelm to the point of distraction. I don't care that Keith E played with the Hammond lying on him...it so often ceased to be musical! I had had an Italian mate translate the lyrics, but he found them somewhat arcane. I prefer the metaphysical to the Hammill inanities. Especially as so often their struggle with English interrupted the flow of the vocals.<br />The music here is at once seductive, beckoning, contemplative at times and rollicks along at others, but always the music had a legitimate reason to be.<br />The English, Felona and Sorona, is just daft. Similar comments can be directed at other misguided meldings of English Language lyrics with  Italian prog instrumentals.<br />I found it distracting enough.<br /><br />So...the Italian language original is a must have for Proggers, but the English version is a historical curiosity only.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I usually enjoy a harder rock sound but Joe's music is so captivating that you can't help but enjoy it. I also had the pleasure of being introduced to the songs on this album at a live performance. Hearing some of these songs live is even more sensational.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is worth reading. A real eye opener !  It will give you hope and faith that everything will be working out fine. I give it five stars!
B00756GKBA|3.0|I listened the album so many times. i'm a sinner, best friend, falling free and gang bang are the best songs in the album with an amazing sound but the others are ordinary and boring. \\"gang bang\\" i think is an answer to \\"bad romance\\". but the song is not as good as bad romance. \\"superstar\\" is not a \\"queen\\" song, it is so simple and bad song. \\"love spent\\" is not that bad but Madonna's singing is so weak and boring. (Actually in many songs her voice is weak and boring, like she is tired when singing it). \\"some girls\\" and \\"turn of the radio\\" are meaningless songs, their sound is extremely ordinary. \\"b-day song\\" is awful in exact word. \\"beautiful killer\\" is a good song but reminds \\"beautiful stranger\\". beautiful stranger was far far better.<br /><br />The result is, the album is not even close to creativity of \\"ray of light\\" which is her best album ever to date.<br /><br />Madonna is one of the strongest and richest superstars on earth and the biggest pop star alive but the album doesn't reflect her maturity. the album is not \\"big\\". most of all there are electronic sounds. Its ok. but where is musical creativity? i'm still hearing the same sounds from ray of light. this is a problem. and there is not even one song with a social message. she has the power, she could have spoken for humanity  i guess. she is an activist  i know but i want to hear this in her songs too. the world is passing through a change period and madonna could have expressed that change desire for freedom more clearly but she still sings girly songs. i don't get it. That's why i think the album is only designed for commercial success and Madonna wanted to show again who the queen is and of course she will support the album with great shows in her world tour.<br /><br />Everybody knows she's the queen but where do we go from here? She doesn't show a new way.

B001HN6922|5.0|I was not expecting much when I was outvoted on family movie night. I was delightfully surprised. Lightning McQueen is being challenged by a newer race car and takes his buddies from Radiator Springs along with him for the ride. He gets embarrassed by Mater and he sends him home. But poor Mater has gotten mixed up with the spies and finds himself in international trouble. He finds himself in a position to stop the bandits who are trying to sabotage the races and kill Lightning McQueen. It's a heartwarming story about friendship and it is funny for both children and adults alike. It was a big hit with my 9 yr old and almost 3 year old, and even my husband enjoyed it. It definitely isn't like the first film but once you get over their differences you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|Okay, this is not some super-cool game app. But not evermyone only plays games on tneir phone or tablet. I think this is nifty, it has crisp colors &amp; is easy-to-read, and it is useful to people who have to call or email or skype people all over the world. Rating it low because it isn't a game is like rating a five-star hotel low because it doesn't have those geodesic 70s hotel bedspreads you miss from a Motel 6 when you were 7.<br /><br />As for it not having more than 5 time zones for the whole world? You must not have looked very closely. I just set it to show me the time in a cow town in Northern Germany, and I had to have it look that up for me. It took about three seconds. Then I tapped &amp; held that setting to drag/move it to the top, next to my current time zone. I especially like the info/graphics on night or day there and whether it is the same date or not.<br /><br />Not every free app will be relevant for you. So don't get those, doofi! And don't waste others' time, or turn off people who actually look at an app and its reviews before deciding to install it or not, with your useless troll spew.

0545405777|1.0|1.) Anyone read Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman? If so you would see that this book's plot shares the basic framework of a book he wrote titled, \\"The Long Walk.\\" The government hosts a long walk where a hundred teen boys compete in a race of sorts unti they succumb to fatigue, hunger, madness, etc... and get a bullet in the brain. In the end the last one standing wins. The winner and his family reap benefits very similar to the victors in the Hunger Games. There is also the Japanese \\"Battle Royal\\" to consider which is even closer in terms of storyline.<br /><br />2.) In addition, any redeeming quality of a love story this book may have isn't realized until the last line of the final book, which means you have to read them all in order to justify reading any of them!<br /><br />3.) The anarchist streak in me wants to give this book a high rating for bringing forward the possibilities and dangers of voting in a government big enough and powerful enough to \\"take care\\" of us all; but ultimately only takes care of its self. However, I cannot give Collins that much credit since the storyline is not her own. At least other versions had underlying subtleties that wove together a deeper, more meaningful plot. This book offers up no such morsel of virtue.<br /><br />4.) Should young readers be reading this? No. This book is rated R and no mother in her right mind would subject her children to this warped line of thinking in their impressionable years. However, if ANY of this trilogy's books is to be read by a late teen it should be limited to this first one. (spoiler) In later books she corrals babies, toddlers, and pre-school age children together and send little bombs to them in packaging that would suggest a gift. The bombs explode, but not to the point that it kills them all, just enough to draw more, underage assistance to the squirming, crying, suffering and bloody babies only to have a second wave of bombs explode.<br /><br />I say, is THIS what qualifies as entertainment to us now? Need we go from satire to slap-stick violence for entertainment? Not for anyone with half a brain or more.
B006Z21ZGK|5.0|My boyfriend and I went to the Final Frontier concert in April 2011 and loved it!  The Blu-Ray concert version was just as amazing as watching it live (also having a good sound system helps too).  One of the bonus features we really enjoyed was of the band's behind the scenes globe-trekking experience---they go into detail about Ed Force One as well as the craziness they experience with production setup from country-to-country.<br /><br />Overall, my boyfriend (a HUGE Iron Maiden fan) and I were highly impressed with the Blu-Ray.
0312641893|4.0|For full review, please visit: [...]    Imagine R2-D2 and C-3PO combing the streets of a Chinese bazaar. Imagine that handsome and charming prince you so often dreamt of as a child. And imagine Cinderella as a girl with a metal hand and foot...because she's simply a cyborg living as a mechanic in New Beijing. Cinder was so ridiculously odd that it was...well... ridiculously awesome. Never would have I ever imagined a Cinderella cyborg with an Asian prince -  I absolutely loved that concept! Loved.    This Cinderella retelling is simply charming.  It's  very lighthearted and fun -  very magical and very fairy tale-ish. Cinder is a great character...level-headed, independent and smart. She's got a tomboyish feature to her, which is something I found very suitable for the role she played. She's a very serious gal and surprisingly it worked for this storyline without being a bore. This paired with her adorable crush on the prince, and Cinder's got to be one of the cutest characters ever when in the presence of royalty.  I really liked her as our heroine but I also loved Prince Kai as our prince charming. He was simply sweet and gallant in every way. Usually, I'm not the biggest fan of love interests or male counterparts that are too perfect or too nice. But somehow...Marissa Meyer's brilliancy managed to make those two traits extremely sexy on Prince Kai. I was practically fanning myself during the elevator scene between  him and Cinder. Propped up against the elevator, asking her to the ball...whew! No wonder he's a heartthrob in New Beijing. I can assure you, Prince Kai is one of the few love interests from a YA fantasy novel that will make you swoon while still maintaining proper etiquette - him and Jem Carstairs of course.  Though I'm a fan of Prince Kai and I loved reading from his perspective,  I'm kind of glad that we never really get an insight on how he felt for Cinder. All the more agonizing once you reach the end of this book!    I felt the world building wasvery unique. I loved the oriental elements that were included, though I can't be sure if they were all Chinese.  Nevertheless, I felt readers were given enough information to understand how Meyer's world functioned. Honestly, as much as I might be a stickler for realistic plots, I don't need a whole history lesson to understand how the world got to where it was. Questioning everything seems to ruin the fun for me at times - so honestly, I don't need to know every political change or detail that happened before Cinder's story began. I just need to know the basics to understand that somehow the world ended up the way that Meyer created it (with the exception that the plot makes sense and isn't too ridiculously out there - see Waterfall review). That said, I felt the world building behind Cinder was appropriate for the writing style that was conveyed.    The only thing I did question in Cinder was the pacing  - in respect to the romance and timeline of events. We lost a few characters in this book, but no one really took the time to mourn their loss, which I felt really took away from the emotional aspect of the story. The big reveal was also pretty obvious from the start - from the moment it was first mentioned I knew... Regardless, I thought Meyer did an excellent job overall and I'm eager to find out what happens to Cinder in her next book of the series. My biggest fear with the Lunar Chronicles series, is the introduction of new main characters for the remaining books. I am absolutely obsessed with Cinder's story, so I'll admit that I hate change and will probably be very stubborn with the change of cast - regardless of whether or not Cinder makes minor appearances. I am, however, confident that Marissa Meyer will surprise me in the end. I just might actually enjoy the direction she takes with the Lunar Chronicles. Hopefully that's what will happen...hopefully.    The theme music for Cinder is In Reverence by David Tolk. Typically, I summarize books in my head with a music video, and so I thought this music went well with the images that I envisioned. Cinder staring out at New Beijing from the palace, Cinder repairing androids in the storage room, Cinder sad...you get the picture. Definitely check out Cinder - it's a delightful book to add to your bookshelf!
B004EPZ03O|5.0|A great film worth buying if your a true muppet fan. Every part of this film was great but I will say one thing Disney messed up on.<br /><br />They added TOO many songs. Now, Man or Muppet and the song Kermit sings in his mansion were good along with the classic Rainbow Connection.<br /><br />But the song at the very beginning, the Me Party song and the rest were a waste of minutes in the film. They could have used those minutes for more classic muppet humor.<br /><br />The film would have been perfect if Disney didn't add too many songs like it was an animated disney movie classic.<br /><br />Jim Henson always owned the muppets and he did best at them. It's a great movie, but those extra songs get boring and weren't needed in the film.
0439813786|5.0|The book I purchased, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, was to be expected by April 3-18. I received it on the third, right on time. It is in great condition, brand new. I am already enjoying reading it!
0061122416|3.0|I know this book has been talked about by people like Oprah, Madonna and various other prestigious individuals with one-word names, but please if you are expecting life-changing advice or storytelling... DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE. That being said the story is certainly entertaining and a very quick read. This is a book you can read on a day trip or over the weekend on a nice getaway or retreat. It also is laced with an overdose of religious overtones, which is fine for some, but clearly distracting for others. All and all, one of those books that EVERYONE is talking about, so one you might want to read just to be able to look like you haven't been living under a rock at the next cocktail party. The book is well \\"imagineered\\" and the writer is certainly not only prolific, but paints some very poetic scenery. It's overall got a good message with a positive spin. But for the life of me I can't understand why some people tout it as revolutionary, unless you are in the 10th grade. Get this book for a flight, or a weekend at the beach, but know it may not live up to its' expectation, unless you treat it for what it is... a well versed metaphor for following your dreams.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|War Horse Rocks I think it is a very good moive! It is also very Powerfull!! However I do not think this Moive Is for kids because it has very sad content to it.  But for people that are looking for a good moive you will not regert it.  I also think that this is one of the best Moives of the year!!! hands down!!! I would reamend it to For young people but as I was saying not for kids.  I went to see this Moive in the therter and loved it very Much!! That is all I have to say about it!!! So If you are a War Fan and like good moives I would reamend this one Highley Thank you!!
1612130283|5.0|I LOVED this book.  I was skeptical at first because I didn't know if I would enjoy the subject matter, but I have to say that this book had me interested from the very first page.  And I am now reading Fifty Shades Darker and I am completely captivated.  I can't get enough, and my husband is very grateful because he is my Christian Grey.  The best way I can describe the plot is I wish I was Anastasia and then I'm glad I'm not and then I wish I could meet Christian Grey and then I'm glad I haven't.  It's a constant roller coaster of being envious of Anastasia and then being relieved I'm not her. Thank you E L James.  I am enjoying the ride!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This author does an excellent job in world building, inviting you into an unusual, enthralling, and increasingly interesting place. The silo idea is very nifty, and I hope he continues more books about it and the inhabitants. Obviously the author is very creative. It's astonishing sometimes to see what he comes up with.<br /><br />The characters are well-rounded and nicely defined, although the focus on mechanics was a bit much for this woman reader who looks for a bit more heart and soul in her reading. But the men in my family would eat that stuff up. And there was enough heart and soul in there that I was nourished enough.<br /><br />I did find the underwater scenes hard. I felt horribly suffocated, which I think would make the author quite happy that his descriptions hit home. Nevertheless, I had to take breaks from that section and go sit in my garden, breathing deeply.<br /><br />I can see why these books are doing so well...

1451627289|5.0|Ok so I'm depressed because I'm no longer a part of Jake's 1960's world. If you've never read Stephen King's books this one would be one to start. Nothing scary and he's so adept at pulling you into his character's world that you believe the unbelievable.  Also I think this is one of the great romances yet no one would ever describe this book as a romance novel.  As much as The Stand was such a powerful book, this one I would call enjoyable.  Escape into this world!

B005K0HDGE|3.0|Like quite a few other reviewers have said, the book starts out great and grabs your attention, then slows down and by the end is very predictable.  The part about the changed present was poorly thought out and very unbelievable.  I guessed the ending about three quarters of the way through.  I was quite disappointed.  Stephan King has done better.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen (1978) was the debut album for Van Halen, and it doesn't disappoint.  With songs like \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\" (personal favorite), \\"Eruption\\", \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\", and \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\", this album rocks.  \\"Eruption\\" is arguably one of the best guitar solos ever recorded.  I don't care for the cover songs on this album, such as \\"You Really Got Me\\" and \\"Ice Cream Man\\".  Generally, I don't like when bands do cover songs, though there are a few exceptions, such as when The Doors did a couple of cover songs on their debut album in 1967.<br /><br />One topic that's always brought up when discussing Van Halen with people is the question of who you like better as a lead singer, David Lee Roth or Sammy Hagar?  Myself, I'm torn between the two.  Both did a good job in their eras.  I'll tell you though, the worst singer was Gary Cherone, even though he did an adequate job.  I've seen Van Halen in concert one time, and it was in 1998 with Gary Cherone on vocals.  Seats were still available.  That tells you something.<br /><br />Van Halen?  I recommend this debut album.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is so easy to use.  I love the fact that there are so many versions available at your fingertips.  I think my favorite version is having the NKJ read out loud.  The reading is done so well, it makes the whole book come alive.

B004LROMWU|1.0|Falling Skies...Where do I begin...<br />I was so excited to see this series after much hype about the show.  In a word...Boring.  Why?  First off...you come in to the war with NO initial attack. What you get? The show starts off with the world looking like crap so you have to assume that the initial attack went very well for these group of aliens...now a band of people (like 30 or a little more), group together to fight what frankly the armed forces of the world totally couldn't.<br /><br />Secondly, I have read reviews that this show did so well over the Summer of 2011 that it was renewed for a second season in 2012...What? Lets back up a little. Steven Spielberg demanded that if he was to do the series, that TNT would go for AT LEAST 2 Seasons guaranteed. So, basically if it received a rating of -1, it would still go for a second season regardless.<br /><br />Third, if you like watching people trek all over the place with limited special effects...this IS the series for you.<br />**** SPOILER ****<br />I know this sounds harsh, believe me, I wanted it to be great, and hopefully it is just one hell of a slow start as I do believe the last episode did grab my attention but only because they had to make the aliens more harsh as ratings were plummeting.<br /><br />**** End of Spoiler ****<br /><br />The Cast has good acting, Noah is cool in the series and the robot special effects are well worth watching...but they need more action and better story hooks to get you to keep coming back.<br /><br />I'm hoping this show succeeds but it's sooooo on the fence right now ... It really kills me that they actually killed \\"V 2009 Series\\" and left a show like this to fill it's place.  \\"V\\" started slow but got GREAT right at the ending and then ABC canceled it...how sad. Let's hope \\"Falling Skies\\" doesn't crash land and sink into the cancellation pit it seems it is destined for :-(

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I wouldn't have picked up the first book if I had any clue that it was going to end like this. The first book was exciting, second was a platform for an exciting end and then......Depression. That's all I carried with me. I mainly kept reading just hoping  that something would come back as far as the feeling I had with book 1 and 2...Nothing. By the time it was all done I actually felt sad and suckered into spending my time on these. I hate to see what the reaction will be when movie 3 comes out.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Got this movie at a better price than at the local stores and it is the same quality as store bought.  I am really happy with this purchase.
B004LWZW8S|2.0|I came to see this movie with a very big bias I will admit. I love Tarsem's filmmaking and his altered perception on common stories. I thought \\"The Fall\\" was hands-down one of the best movies of the past decade and thoroughly enjoyed The Cell.<br /><br />With that said, when I heard he was making this movie a year ago I was really excited and started reading up on it everywhere. When I got to the theatre I was still sitting around for 20 minutes after the film was done expecting there to be a epilogue that explained a lot. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE STORY??!!! It felt like the producers took the script and cut it in half over and over again and we only saw scraps of what could be! In greek mythology Hyperion is a Titan, I kept waiting for them to explain that he escaped and is seeking his revenge disguised as a human, which would make sense as to why he is doing everything and knows certain things and is so much stronger than everyone, but NO, nothing, the movie just abruptly ends. What gives?<br /><br />As with any movie by Tarsem the film is incredibly lavish and the design tends to be the strongest element in the movie. The only problem with this is that you can tell they only filmed inside sound studios because which is weird because most of the film takes place outdoors. It really made everything feel closed in and isolated, which worked against them I think. I think they were trying to make things more intimate for the 3D effect, but this movie really didn't need to be in 3D!!!<br /><br />As far as the acting goes, Henry Cavill was alright as an action star, but due to the crappy storyline there really isn't much to work with. Mickey Rourke is good of course as a ruthless king, Frida Pinto is so-so, nothing too earthshaking here. What was surprising was Stephen Dorff making a comeback as a sidekick thief who tags along for the adventure. Luke Evans also does a good job as a stern and commanding Zeus.<br /><br />When the Blu-Ray was announced and they stated that there is over an hour of additional footage and an alternate ending I thought that it was a must see because the theatrical version was so bad, so I went out looking to rent it. Unfortunately the company that produced this created 3 seperate versions of the blu-ray and then only released the standard version to rental companies like Blockbuster and Netflix. That means that if you want to see the full version story that you were intended to see from the director then you have to purchase the Blu-Ray. Total crap!
1612130283|2.0|I read her first book and it is CRAAP! If this is the best seller than it just goes to show you, women especially are using all of their time on a book when they could be using that time on a real relationship. I don't know about the other two books but I stopped at the first. Why? She writes about a guy that is into sadistic BDSM and being a dominate, yet she throws in stuff like how he has his mouth open in surprise and how he's SUCH a dominate that he carefully goes through a ton of contracts to basically ask her \\"can I dominate you please?\\" She writes about hardcore stuff but the woman obviously knows nothing about it. She can only begin to speculate. She's out of her league in the topic and the story goes belly side up after about 100 pages after their first seeex which btw was cheesy. An online article got me interested as to the quality of her books. It's weak and the sexual suspense, how far can it go with an amateur that knows little about what she writes other than googling up most of her info. Don't get me wrong, she's a pretty good writer, her materials just don't hold up to what she wants to write about.<br /><br />If this is a best seller in New York, that's a scary thought altogether. I'm guessing whatever keeps you going considering how bad the economy is?

B005J2UM9S|3.0|characters: 3.5/10  story: 3.5/10  gore: hardly any  scariness: 9/10    I can't imagine anyone's reading this that hasn't already seen the movie or read 20+ other reviews already...    I don't see what was special about the characters.  I feel like back when I was 15, if I was in any of these actors' bodies, I would have played each character exactly like they were played.  The characters felt 'true'... and not stupid... and not immature... but just somehow hollow from an adult's perspective, like the ideas you had when you were 15.  I'm not sure if this was due to (1) bad actors, (2) a bad script, or (3) bad directing.  I feel like it's a little bit of everything, with emphasis on 2 and 3.    I also don't see why a lot of reviewers seemed to like the story.  Film crew locks themselves inside an old abandoned psychiatric hospital; scary s*** starts to happen; they're actually locked in forever; they go crazy like the former patients.  The one semi-cool though probably-been-done-before advent were the exits changing and it never getting light outside.  But even that... it takes a second to digest and you feel like you're now a step ahead of the director.    Now that being said, the film was really scary.  From midway through to finish, very scary.  All of the scares were jump scares, as you'd expect with a movie filmed in the dark in a maze of a place, but the tension was built up pretty well from scene to scene.  That's why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1, which I'd give based on the other criteria.    I can see scary movie purists tearing this to shreds.  And frankly I'm not surprised that this went straight to DVD, even with the found footage formula being a success on the whole.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was a little hesitant about this set considering all that I heard about the new additions.<br /><br />I first saw the original SW in 1977 when I was six years old and it most certainly had an impact. The original trilogy is near and dear to my heart for all those boring and lonely days of my youth where I would either read the Marvel comic, scour Starlog magazine for any tidbit, or thankfully and finally watch the film first on HBO, then CBS for its premiere, then at last on VHS.<br /><br />Time, maturity, and the discovery of girls led me to my own adventures, but I always came back to Star Wars on a rainy and dull day to enjoy the fantasy, sound, and visuals of this truley wonderful series of films. I ultimately find myself working in the industry today because of it.<br /><br />The Special Edition brought SW back to theaters in '97 and they were a joy to behold, with a few special surprises! Though I would much rather have the song Lapti Nek back in Jedi, it really doesn't matter.  1999 finally brought us new SW movies and despite my frustration with various attributes of the Prequel trilogy, I find them to be visually stunning and very entertaining.<br /><br />My adoration hit a snag with the DVD release and the replacement of the actor who briefly portrayed Anakin's ghost at the end of Jedi with Hayden.  I understand why Lucas made this revision but I found it jarring. So upon hearing of the blu ray with even more revisions I did not set out to buy them and would just settle with the DVDs of the original theatrical releases.<br /><br />Christmas 2011 comes and goes, lo and behold the lovely girlfriend has purchased this set as a gift for me. Well, it's not very often I get a Star Wars item as a gift anymore so I felt like a kid and was very happy to have it. Since then I've been slowly making my way through the set and it is well worth the time, warts and all.<br /><br />Look, I can empathize with the original trilogy purists, and the prequel haters. There are, without question, revisions that are maddening,  Jar Jar antics that make me cringe, and alien cow surfing that just makes my head explode. But at the end of watching each of the films I found myself humming the theme music and feeling a little bit happier. None of the prequel, or revisions was remotely enough to tarnish the fun of watching these movies. And on my 55 inch display through the 5.1 surround sound, they look and sound incredible. What a joy! Especially hearing my adorable 5 year old niece laughing at Jar Jar Binks.<br /><br />I highly recommended this set for anyone who wants to check out of the real world for a few hours and be amazed at the top quality, family friendly, special effects extravaganza of the Star Wars saga.<br /><br />Thank you George. Please make more!

1400069289|4.0|This is one of those books whose contents I wish I had known much earlier. Sometimes one reads a book and you say to youself if I had read this at least 10 years ago then I might be living a different and much improved life, well this is one of those books. It can potentially change your life for the better.<br /><br />We are creature of habits. What we usually don't know is how much we are affected by our habits. The book cites a study as much as 40% of our behavior is determined by habits. That is a lot.<br /><br />The book not only explains how our habits work, but how we can alter them. Fortunately for us, changing our habits isn't overly difficult once we know how to do it effectively. Furthermore, changing only a few (maybe 1-2) key habits can make us more disciplined and increase our willpower in our everyday lives. In other words, changing or creating 1-2 key habits can alter your life.<br /><br />The author is a professional writer but not a Psychologist. The book is very well written in a fluid style and plenty of research and examples are cited. The author knows what is writing about and they are very well supported by research. There is no pop-psychology here.<br /><br />I felt the last half of the book were mostly fillers. Many stories are endless details and examples of personal and business successes related to habits. Maybe the author had to meet a book length requirement. You certainly would not miss much by skipping the last 1/3 of the book.

1933492953|5.0|Now, this isn't really a review of the book, but rather the sharing of some pretty fantastic news. Please read on.    First off, awesome book (though I don't own a copy of one myself...yet)! So earlier this year I ordered a copy of 'Framed Ink' from amazon but my order was cancelled about a month or so later after ordering it (actually, it's been about a month now since amazon cancelled the order), because the book had now become out of print (...but not for long).    \\"Not for long\\" you might ask? So, has anyone checked out Mateu-Mestre's blog lately? Glad I did. There will be a reprint of the book that'll be coming out around mid-May or so (yes this year). He also has a new book coming out around the same time called: Trail of Steel - 1441 A.D.    Awesome and Awesome.    Thought I'd share the news and the link to his blog. :)  Anyway here's his blog:    [...]    So for those that were sad or what have you because 'Framed Ink' is (currently) out of print-rejoice! You will soon have the chance to buy it again so this time around don't let it pass you by! (And hopefully amazon will sell it again at a reasonable price like it did before it went out of print; that and hopefully they'll sell Mateu-Mestre's new book as well!)    And you're welcome (to those of you that don't want to pay ridiculous prices for 'new' and used copies of 'Framed Ink' on this or any other site)!

076781326X|4.0|I absolutely LOVE Oliver! I have been a huge fan of the movie since I saw it on VHS when I was a kid (maybe 25 years ago). I have always been a lover of musicals including Little Shop of Horrors, Chicago, Dream Girls, etc. I think the actors were amazing, especially Ron Moody who played the fiendish Fagin. Now watching it as an adult, it's amazing to me how evil Bill Sykes actually was! Tremendous performances.<br /><br />The only criticism about the DVD I really have is that in order to watch the entire movie, you must turn the disc over at a certain point, which was never mentioned anywhere on the product description here on the website. There is a \\"intermission\\" just after the point where Oliver is taken in by Mr. Brownlow and taken to his home. I have seen other reviews that have said people thought they did not get the correct DVD. You probably did. By turning over the DVD, it will continue at the point where he awakens in a beautiful home just moments after the end of the other half. Besides that, everything worked okay for me.
B007BVOF8E|4.0|Not all spy stories feature high flying athletics, tire-screeching car chases, thunderous gunfights, chiseled agents, and nude beauties. TTSS doesn't rely on any of these things to tell a compelling and sometimes touching story. Gary Oldman and Benedict Cumberbatch were both excellent. Supporting cast was quite good, too. I don't know that the direction was the best, and the film certainly had a non-standard (in a value neutral sense) feel to it, but I thoroughly enjoyed the film.
0316098329|4.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It was so much easier to read because it was through the view of the child.<br /><br />******SPOILER ALERT*******<br /><br />after the boy is rescued, I feel the novel loses some of it's depth. The mother becomes a little more selfish, but I think I understand that. If you were locked in a room being sexually abused for that long, wouldn't you be alittle selfish too? All in all, amazing.
1451648537|5.0|At the beginning I was not happy with Isaacson for his frequent sarcastic remarks about Jobs' brash demeanor, but as I went on reading I was more zapped by reading what Jobs has managed to pull of in his relatively short life -- filled with lot of ups and downs, and eventually started ignoring Isaacson's occasional sarcastic remarks.<br /><br />For anyone who needs motivation for what one can do with the passion for art and perfection, and a drive to make your ambitions come true, without any formal coaching from family or college, this is THE book!<br /><br />Hats of to Steve Jobs!
B005TPS0WG|4.0|I feel as though some reviewers on this page missed some under tones in this ep.<br />Dean is obviously worried about Sam. And I think some of what he does has to do with protecting his little brother. Saving him from having to kill a friend.<br />Also, you must consider his own pain at losing Lisa and Ben. Honestly, when I saw the kid I thought Dean was going to kill him too. But instead he tells him to stay on the non-homicidal straight and narrow. Proving that while he may be troubled, Dean is forever the self-sacrificing protector.

B003Y5H5HO|3.0|I'd read all three \\"Girl\\" books before all the hubbub started about the movies - both Swedish and American - and had become quite intrigued by the quirky genius of Elizabeth Solander, the main character.  I'd also watched all three Swedish movies on my Kindle Fire before I'd even heard of the American remake.  After reading the other reviews, I rented the American version to get another take on Elizabeth.  I was disappointed.  To be honest, I can't quite put my finger on the reasons for it, but to me Elizabeth lost her sharp edginess in this version.  One thing was that in her first appearance in this film, she wore the \\"in-your-face\\" Goth outfit  that didn't show up until the culminating court scene in the Swedish film.  It seemed that her radical appearance was the high point, and her ability to fascinate ebbed  downward from there.  End result?  I much preferred the Swedish original.
1401309666|5.0|First of all, if you are paging down to look at the reviews of this book to see if it might be worth reading, I recommend you do. This book is well worth a look for those interested in a relatively new and fresh perspective on the ideas of eCommerce and online retail like this very site.<br /><br />As for the book itself, The Long(er) Tail (2008) is the revised version of Anderson's 2006 book, with a new chapter focused on marketing. It is a quick read at just under 300 pages and never gets too dry or boring, even when it delves into the particulars of Anderson's theory.<br /><br />The concept of the Long Tail is taken from a sales graph of music downloads through Rhapsody. The \\"hits\\" make up a majority of sales profit for music downloads, but thanks to the internet and all of the retail technology at their disposal, Rhapsody has more than just the 2,000 most popular tracks available, they have a few million. And, if the downloads are graphed out, there is a trailing section of sales that never quite falls to zero, as even the most obscure tracks are downloaded at least a few times a month. Hence, the graph has a long tail.<br /><br />The concept of Long Tale economics, then, is that markets are no longer solely tied to the concept of \\"hits\\", of blockbusters and New York Times bestsellers to make profit. A company can turn a profit, and quite tidily, by focusing on the more obscure, the niche products, using the unlimited shelf space of the internet to stock millions of different products and making them available to as many people as possible.<br /><br />Anderson explores, expands, extrapolates and dissects this theory throughout the book, from discussing the history of the Long Tail market and the technology that makes it possible, to the new chapter on marketing and how web advertizing is being geared towards individualization of the customer, rather than mass-media marketing.<br /><br />As Anderson himself says, the Long Tail is by no means the only market out there, the \\"hits\\" market still exists and still has the lion's share of the sales figures. But for the first time since mass marketing was invented, the niche markets, where the products people purchase are what they want, rather than the products everyone else is buying, have a significant share in the market. And that share is only getting bigger.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book depicts what a dystopian society would be like.  Every teenager should read this. The heroine and most other characters make decisions that any everyday person would make in their situation. The heroine is not superhuman, she is just an everyday girl, who became a symbol by accident?
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|This is an abomination.  The story is absurd.  There are plot gaps the size of Montana.  The story doesn't track from Phantom to LND at all.  The characters are totally changed in ways that are clearly contrived to fit with the plot of LND.  And the score is okay but it is nowhere near as good as Phantom and it's simply not good enough to make up for the disaster of a screenplay. LND is based on a sequel to the book Phantom of the Opera NOT written by the author Gaston Leroux.  It's called Phantom of NY and it reads like (really) bad fan fiction.  Spoilers ahead:<br /><br />1. In LND, Erik and Christine have a child together.  To make this happen, we're supposed to believe that right after Phantom ended they slept together the night she returned his ring.  When she woke up Erik was gone so she ran off and married Raoul.<br /><br />There are about a hundred things wrong with this.  First off, we see Christine and Raoul leave in Phantom so it physically couldn't happen.  Second, all Erik wanted was someone to love him for him, and he was willing to kill Raoul to get the facade of that.  Now we're supposed to believe the minute he gets her love he runs off and leaves her?  Third, if Christine really loved Erik, why didn't she just wait?  She was at his house - he would have come back.  Fourth, Christine had no reason to want to sleep with Erik in Phantom.  He had kidnapped her, blackmailed her and threatened to kill her fiance.  And so she slept with him after all that?  Fifth, Christine and Raoul were engaged when all this supposedly went on, which makes her a pretty lousy person and a cheat.<br /><br />2. Christine pawns off Erik's kid on Raoul.  So not only is she a cheat, she's also a liar.  Great, I'm glad I invested time watching such a worthy heroine in Phantom.<br /><br />3. Raoul is a drunken, gambling louse.  This character change is very contrived.  All he ever wanted was Christine, and he risked his life to save her, and we're supposed to believe the minute he gets her, he casts her aside to get drunk?<br /><br />4. By putting Erik back into Christine's life, the plot ruins him too.  Erik had lived a tortured life and he had taken it out on others by killing and frightening.  But Christine's pity and affectiion led to his one redeeming act: he let her go free.  To put them back together and give them a second chance destroys that sacrifice.  Although Erik's sacrifice didn't rise to the level of Sydney's in A Tale of Two Cities, putting Erik and Christine back together with a drunken Raoul is akin to having a sequel to A Tale of Two Cities where we learn that Sydney's death was faked and he goes back to London where Charles Darnay has become a drunk and a womanizer and now Sydney gets his shot with her.  What made Sydney's sacrifice beautiful is that he died for the woman he loved knowing not only that he could never have her but that someone else did; Erik's sacrifice at the end of Phantom is similar.  LND ruins it.<br /><br />5. Christine, Raoul and Erik aren't the only characters that have been gutted: Meg and M. Giry are changed in less likeable ways too.<br /><br />As an aside, I also think it was pretty wrong for ALW to do a sequel to Phantom.  Phantom is based on the book Phantom of the Opera written by Gaston Leroux.  The characters are Leroux's, and I don't think it's right to do a sequel to something that so drastically guts his characters.  It would be like doing a sequel to the play A Christmas Carol and having Tiny Tim grow up and join a gang.he gets her, he casts her aside to get drunk?<br /><br />4.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't get the bad reviews. I thought the book was perfect. It's not a fairy tale..its very realistic. War is war. I am not sure what people were expecting from this book, but after all the negative reviews, almost didn't read it. I am so glad I did..b/c I could not put it down. The author did a great job with closing the loop..it's unfortunate that so many people had to die, but really after reading the first two books, I didn't really expect the author to leave anyone untouched. Please do read it ..you will enjoy it.
B002WCLG3O|4.0|Halo Legends Blu-ray:<br /><br />So glad this movie was produced in recent years... It incorporates all the elements of the XBOX games, including Halo Reach, which at the time of this release, had not itself been released. The movie producers must've had inside Bungee intel, because the look and feel of this movie definetly has aspects of Reach...<br /><br />I guess the blu-ray version is better, yet i don't see how an animated movie could even be in high def? Maybe the backgrounds are better, and yes blu-ray comes in righteous 7.1 channel surround sound (when offerred)... Some minor issues with the contrast and ghosting (my TV is a brand new full HD Sharp), slight noise filter over the animated characters, probably due to too many pixels where there shouldn't be. Very cool movie though, made a Halo fan out of me where previously i was not! I went out and bought the whole video game series 1 week after originally watching this movie in May of 2011. I would have rather bought the special edition DVD version with 2 disc set instead; because the picture is probably going to be the same. :/<br /><br />This great film provides a lot of insight into the Halo universe, and once u watch it, it is hard to forget. Truly original (i think) storytelling and approach in animation. Each short has it's own style, but all are entertaining, especially the full CGI final short, which showcases Master Chief and his crew doing their thing in marvelous spectacle, while trying to board a Covenant mother ship from one seat speeders in space! The final scene is worth getting the movie for.<br />Enjoy! :)

B001DCQJ4A|3.0|It must be said that this is a committed performance, often inspired, and features excellent sound.  But I have to question the insistence on using period string technique in Brahms...it just doesn't sound right.  Using very little vibrato and little or no portamento is just plain weird for Brahms in my opinion.  This becomes especially evident in the second movement, which begs for some feeling, and Gardiner just does not deliver.  In sum, I didn't like it.  If you must have a more period informed Brahms set, go for the Mackerras/Scottish Chamber set which contains many of the best qualities of this recording but also more flexibility in phrasing, and more romantic feeling.

B0073XORLU|4.0|It's not a Jethro Tull album. So okay, I'll buy no Martin Barre. He was good not being on Rupi's Dance (as would I). I'll also buy that Ian has a gigantic ego. Who knew? That said, who'da thunk I'd be writing a review for any release (that wasn't a Christmas album) by this dude at this point? I've enjoyed Jethro Tull for a long time, but really gave up on them in the late 70's. Last album I bought was Stormwatch, last tour I saw too. Eddie Jobson's entrance wasn't enough to sway me back to Ian's world after that point. Any taste I had of Ian's subsequent outings be they fishy or feline were met by me with indifference.<br /><br />So, with this Ian Anderson release what do we have? If you were to have heard it blind a few months ago you'd swear it was an outtake from some session past. Great lengths have been taken to replicate the Hammond organ and acoustic/electric guitar sound of TAAB. Also present are Ian's voice, which while nothing like it was in the 70's is in the best form it's been in years. He's not rattling off verses at 4/4 time anymore, and everything is written well within his range. It's all just a little more laid back. He still goes from soft and lilting to loud and distorted (with a little technical help) and back again. Of course his flute playing is everything it ever was, and is never enough.<br /><br />I'm sure you're already familiar with the concept of the album, suffice to say it's a really clever way of approaching old subject matter. Ian has always been masterful at third person storytelling, but this is quite a departure thematically. It's really all quite involving. Spoken word passages bookend the \\"chapters\\" throughout. A lot of his biting, bitter wit and social commentary is seen through slightly softer jaded eyes. Ian doesn't really care what anybody thinks of him or anything else for that matter anymore.<br /><br />Also present and long missed are actual melodies. Ear worm stuff. Perhaps some of these tunes have been rattling around for a while, but I hope not. I'm wanting more! While the songs have a more individual nature than TAAB, the album flows nicely as a cohesive unit. There are repeating themes as well as sections culled from TAAB for continuity, but it's nothing like I was imagining it would be. Many of these songs do have the TAAB feel to them as far as song structure. Ian seems to have channeled a lot of that \\"where he was at\\" at the time feeling. So well done in fact I'm beginning to mix up the two albums in my head!<br /><br />There are of course elements of many of his \\"periods\\" here, and while there's nothing particularly new, there's nothing that seems derivative either. Echoes of the rocking War Child and Minstrels, the pastoral sound of Songs and Horses as well as jazzy or eastern infused Roots and Rupi's all seem present. The song A Change of Horses embodies many of these in its 8 minute running time. Speaking of running time, this one clocks in at 53 minutes, longer than any of the classic albums. But it seems to fly. Seriously there are more than just a couple gems in here. The rest of the musicianship is wonderful, I won't expound on any elements as that's purely subjective. I leave that to you.<br /><br />Now to voice my complaints. At times it's all just a little too slick. I'm not really getting a sense of \\"chemistry\\" here. It could be it's just Ian having complete control over the process and production. There are also points where Ian himself sounds as if he's phoning it in, but then again he's seemed that way in previous efforts at times as well. Replicating the enchantment of past Tull albums I would assume to be an impossible task regardless. The studio itself is now a sterile high-tech environment, and a cocoon from outside influences. Gone are the days of crappy borrowed analog equipment and all night sessions fueled by cigarettes, alcohol and - \\"whatever\\". And with the new perfected environment a bit of the magic dies I suppose.<br /><br />If you're reading thisyou probably have a pretty strong feeling one way or the other about the album, the band, the man. But in the end, Jethro Tull always was about Ian, he was just really good at dragging the rest along for the ride. Of course I'm sorry that some got off at a different stop. As a solo album I'd say it's pretty darn good - dare I say even inspired. As a Jethro Tull album - it more than stands up. Apparently, having a story to tell makes all the difference and Ian has something to say. Tell me more! I for one am happy to take a bite from the classic prog apple after 30 some odd years. This doesn't in any way feel like an old vet trying fly from here to recapture former glories. It sounds fresh and vintage at the same time. Like a friend you haven't seen for ages. Once you talk it's like no time at all has passed as you relive the past, and yet everything has changed. As Ian says, \\"Odd chap, life\\".<br /><br />4 easy \\"I like it\\" Amazon Stars (really almost 5 just because). But 3 if you're one of those music reviewer types. Sound quality is a solid 4 if not better, this is probably the best sound ever for JT or IA - thanks (again) Steve! This one will be in rotation for a long while!you probably have a pretty strong feeling one way or the other about the album, the band, the man.

0756405890|4.0|When I picked up The Name of the Wind, I knew 3 things about it:<br /><br />1. It is an \\"epic fantasy.\\"<br /><br />2. The protagonist is an innkeeper.<br /><br />3. It's supposed to be awesome.<br /><br />Now, there's something you need to know about me and things that are supposed to be awesome: I tend to not think they're awesome. I'll spare you specific examples [*cough*Gone With the Wind*cough] so that you don't freak out and decide to hate me forever. I just tend to like what I like, and what I like often doesn't line up with what the world at large likes.<br /><br />Plus, the more something is hyped, the more disappointed I tend to be when it's not all I imagined it would be. You'd think I'd learn my lesson and stop expecting greatness every time greatness is forecast, but no. I'm incorrigible that way.<br /><br />So I went into The Name of the Wind in a divided state. On the one hand, I was really excited to read a spectacularly awesome fantasy book. On the other, I was bracing myself for disappointment when I inevitably disagreed with the populace at large.<br /><br />And after finishing TNOTW, I have to say...I'm still divided.<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />TNOTW revolves around Kote, keeper of a modest inn in a small town. As the story opens, the townsfolk are all in a tizzy over some strange happenings: namely, giant spider-demons attacking travelers on the road. They come into the inn, troubled and flummoxed, and discuss the horrors of the world outside.<br /><br />Then, unbeknownst to the townsfolk, Kote and his assistant, Bast, have a Very Mysterious Discussion where we come to realize that Kote knows something about the spider-demons, and that for some reason (beyond the obvious fact that they are giant spider-demons), they are Very Bad.<br /><br />Then he goes out to kill a bunch of them. But before he can, he stumbles into a traveling scribe. Or rather, the scribe -- Chronicler -- stumbles into him. Chronicler was riding down the road, minding his own business, when he was robbed by highwaymen and forced to set out on foot. Lucky for him, he wandered straight into where Kote had set up spider-killing camp, and arrived just in time for the party.<br /><br />After witnessing Kote single-handedly dispatch a bunch of spider-demons, and subsequently passing out, Chronicler is brought to the inn, where the truth quickly comes out: Kote is really Kvothe (pronounced \\"quothe,\\" and thus screwing with my internal narrator every single time I read his name), the legendary -- and presumed dead -- hero. Chronicler immediately presses Kvothe for information, since he's pretty much the most famous guy ever. And Kvothe grudgingly agrees to tell him the story of his life. It will take 3 days.<br /><br />[Side note: It took me for-e-ver to realize that the book's subtitle, \\"The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day 1,\\" refers to the first day of storytelling. Duh.]<br /><br />Thus begins the story of Kvothe's childhood, where he was raised by loving parents in a troupe of traveling performers...until they were brutally murdered by the Chandrain, terrifying beings that, up until that point, Kvothe (and everybody else in the world) presumed didn't exist.<br /><br />Young Kvothe mourns his parents and friends, while struggling to survive, for several years before he sets off determined to complete his education at the University, which is a lot like Hogwarts: The College Years. The students learn about magic in a variety of forms, although they don't call it magic. \\"Magic\\" is a term for ignorant country bumpkins. University students pursue sympathy, artificery, alchemy, and other fancy words that really just mean magic.<br /><br />Kvothe is 15 when he enters the University, several years younger than his youngest classmates, but his prodigious intelligence, coupled with his sharp wit and abundant charisma, help him quickly advance through the ranks. He makes a few close friends and more than a few enemies. Oh, and there's a girl. Of course.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS:<br /><br />I learned something about myself while reading this book. I realized that I am a big fan of the 3-act narrative.<br /><br />Act 1: Characters are introduced. Background is given. World is built.<br /><br />Act 2: Things go well. Hint of conflict. Or maybe even lots of conflict. You get a good feeling for who the good guys and bad guys are, and where the story is headed.<br /><br />Act 3: Big finish. Possibly a battle. Major conflict is resolved in a thrilling way. Possible set-up for future conflict if it isn't a stand-alone novel.<br /><br />Part of the reason I'm so divided about TNOTW is that it doesn't follow this formula. At all. Really, the whole book seems like a big Act 1. Maybe a bit of Act 2. Definitely no Act 3. I didn't realize that I was hungering for an Act 3 until I finished the book and never got one. I was so sure it would be there, even when I noticed I was down to the last 50 pages and no noticeable conflict was being set up, that I was actually shocked when it never happened.<br /><br />But then again, this book never promised me that it would be set up in 3 acts. As a matter of fact, it told me very clearly what to expect when Kvothe began his tale: a story of a man's life that would be told in 3 days. And this was Day 1. The fact that I didn't really pick up on this -- or was expecting the story of his life to fall neatly into three days of 3-act narratives -- is my fault.<br /><br />So I need to judge this book on what it is, and not what I expected it to be.<br /><br />The Pros:<br /><br />Mr. Rothfuss is a wonderful storyteller. He gives enough detail to draw a reader into the world, but not so much that I got bored or that my attention wandered. He was able to draw from me every emotional response that the story required: happiness, contentment, sadness, fear, desperation, determination, anger, triumph.<br /><br />Probably one of my favorite scenes in the whole book was Kvothe's first time performing at the Eolian. As a musician and former performer, I could vividly empathize with all the emotions he was feeling, and I actually felt my heart racing when he took the stage. It was a magnificent scene, even though (as far as I can tell) it had nothing to do with Kvothe eventually becoming a hero. Being able to draw me so far into scenes like that -- scenes with little adventure or intrigue, but full of emotion -- was one of the book's great strengths.<br /><br />The magical world he created was also extremely well-developed. The laws of sympathy are well-defined and loosely rooted in science, which makes it almost hard to believe that this stuff couldn't work in real life. All the divisions of sympathy work together in an orderly and understandable way. And Mr. Rothfuss never bends or breaks the laws of sympathy, even when it could possibly make for some cool action scenes.<br /><br />Kvothe's time at the University is in turns exciting, frustrating, illuminating, and captivating. And always interesting.<br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />First off, many of the main characters have more than one name (maybe this is meant to underscore the heavy emphasis placed on Naming in the story). Kvothe, Bast, Chronicler, Denna...all go by multiple names during the course of the story. It's not really confusing, but I'm also not sure it's entirely necessary. Kvothe/Kote's name change is understandable. I don't know if the rest really are.<br /><br />Secondly, Kvothe is kind of irritating. I didn't dislike him, but I didn't love him either. He's just too good at everything. He's ridiculously handsome. He has a voice like an angel. He can play the lute like he's some sort of superhuman with 15 fingers. He's apparently memorized every minute fact to have ever tripped across his consciousness. He excels at every form of sympathy that he tries. He can spin a yarn, work a crowd, woo the ladies, and outmaneuver the wiliest of weasels.<br /><br />Eventually, you just kind of want a protagonistto have some weaknesses, ya know? And no, \\"I'm misunderstood by the jealous and petty professor/student because they're envious of my awesomeness\\" is not weakness.<br /><br />Lastly, I felt at times the story lacked direction. It opens with the Very Mysterious and Terrifying spider-demons, then never mentions them again until the very end of the book, and then only kind of. It sets up Kvothe to be the greatest and most famous hero the world has ever known, but doesn't even begin to tell us why. He spends the entire book trying to find information about the Chandrain, and ends with barely more than he started with.<br /><br />I understand that most of this is probably because this is the first book in a trilogy, but I'm of the opinion that if you can't resolve any of the story lines in the first book, then you should just write one long book. Overarching plots and conflicts are great. I am a fan of the multi-book series. But let's resolve something in book 1. Let's not just write trilogies for trilogies' sake. I know trilogies are all the rage right now, but come on. Let's have a purpose.<br /><br />A friend described the middle of the book as \\"meandering,\\" and I'd have to agree. It meanders. It's an interesting meander. I never was bored, or annoyed. But I couldn't figure out what the point of all these little vignettes was. It just kind of moseyed around, taking its sweet time, with no clear destination in mind.<br /><br />What's more, since the story never really felt like it was going anywhere or driving toward anything, I never really had that sense of urgency to keep my turning pages. I could put the book down in the middle of a chapter and not feel that pull -- you know, the one. It's the one you feel when you're doing dishes or folding the laundry, and all of a sudden you're not doing those things anymore because you're reading. You didn't decide, necessarily, to stop being productive and start reading. You just were reading, because the book pulled you back. Because there was something in the story that hadn't resolved, and you needed to know how it resolved.<br /><br />Anyway. I never felt the pull. I would enjoy the book while I was reading, put it down when I needed to, and pick it up later when I remembered I was in the middle of a book. It was a weird feeling to be able to completely walk away from a book I was actually enjoying, and not feel the pull. It's never happened to me before.<br /><br />THE VERDICT:<br /><br />So I'm torn. Was this book an \\"epic fantasy\\" in the way I'm used to thinking of epic fantasies? No. Yes, the hero goes on a journey, but nothing much is accomplished, and only a few years of Kvothe's early life are covered. Maybe the trilogy as a whole will be an epic fantasy. But as far as I'm concerned, TNOTW is simply a fantasy. Nothing epic about it.<br /><br />Was it enjoyable? Yes, for the most part. Frustrating when I realized I was basically just reading one big setup for book 2 (or maybe even book 3), and wasn't going to get any payoff in this book. But barring that, it was enjoyable.<br /><br />Was it well-written? Did everything in the book make sense, according to the rules of the world Kvothe was living in? Absolutely. Zero complaints there.<br /><br />Do I recommend it? Right now I'm going to say yes. I haven't finished book 2 (The Wise Man's Fear) yet, and book 3 (The Doors of Stone) hasn't even been released. I have a feeling this is one of those trilogies where once I finish the whole thing, it's going to drastically impact my opinion of the first book. But for now, I'm going to say yes. It has great potential to be a fantastic story.<br /><br />I just hope something actually happens in the next book.Eolian.

B00785P2QC|5.0|Okay, so I think this is a nice take on virtual city games as it includes recycling, trucks, buses, etc.  It's nice, and get's great reviews. There are a amazing amout<br /> of buildings and such to chose from and new updates often. You can start out with a single building (which you do) but soon your city will become a buzzing economy. If you are looking through the store for a game to pass the time and you stumble upon this app but are skeptical at first but just happen to read this review ,here's a hint. GET IT.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|This book is as smooth and enjoyable as a well-made British cup of tea. It reminds me a lot of the TV series \\"Downton Abbey\\" and makes me wonder, which came first? This book is a bit darker, though, and dares to look into the shaded areas of peoples' lives and personalities. If you like \\"Brideshead Revisited,\\" \\"Upstairs and Downstairs\\" and similar fiction, I think you will enjoy this book. I have just bought another kindle book by the same author and look forward to reading it.

B0067EKY9K|5.0|This movie is the feel great movie of 2012.  There are several plot twists involving love and politics which keep the viewer engaged in the film.  The acting is superb!  I give this movie five stars and an A+ rating.  I am going to buy the blu-ray when it comes out and highly recommend you do the same!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am an avid fan and longtime reader of erotica.  And I didn't enjoy this book.  My husband got it for me due to all the hullabaloo and mainstream media articles surrounding it.  I hadn't ever even heard of it before he gave it to me.  And now I know why.  The spots around the 'web I frequent where others are also erotica fanatics don't mention much about Fifty Shades for a reason.<br /><br />While I do commend the author's attempt at authenticity, I was appalled at how obvious it was that the author's a Brit trying to write from the perspective of an American.  There were sooooo many odd choices of wording (i.e. the white shirts we Americans refer to as tank tops or \\"wife beaters\\", or simply undershirts were referred to in the book as a SINGLET!!!! WTF is a \\"singlet\\"???? I had to look it up as we in the USA never, ever use that term! Then there was the implication that any 21 year old college student would actually say something like, \\"Hey girlfriend!\\" when talking to one of her besties.... ummm... what?!?!?!  No one actually says \\"Hey girlfriend!\\").  I was actually offended by the abundant use of British vernacular amongst two obviously very American people.  The oddness occurred often enough that it consistently threw me off while I was reading, causing me to rely on Kindle's built-in dictionary quite often.<br /><br />The next thing that I did not enjoy were the Dom/sub and sex scenes.  Classical music during a scene amongst two people under thirty years of age?  Odd, but I went with it.  However, the protagonist's freak-out over being spanked (when she was ready to completely throw away her virginity on a whim) was over the top.  Ana, to me, seemed a lot like Bella Swan.  While I did enjoy the Twilight series overall, I absolutely *do not* like Bella Swan, and likewise felt no connection with Anastasia.  She was too fake/phony/whiny/whatever for me.  I haven't read many books and had an actual angry reaction, but this one certainly made me pissed by the time I reached the end.<br /><br />I appreciate what the author attempted to do, but I think this book is better described as a romance novel for vanilla people who occasionally think a kinky thought or two.... not as BDSM erotica, which it clearly is not.  If it were more appropriately described, then I probably wouldn't have been as put-off and disappointed as I was.  I really wanted to like this book, but as an erotica fan and non-vanilla young American, I simply couldn't.  The one thing I did enjoy, though, was the non-traditional ending.  That was well-played and executed on the author's part... even if the protagonist was \\"over the top\\" about it.reached the end.<br /><br />I appreciate what the author attempted to do, but I think this book is better described as a romance novel for vanilla people who occasionally think a kinky thought or two.... not as BDSM erotica, which it clearly is not.

0345803485|3.0|I flew through this book in several hours.  I found it to be a light, enjoyable read. The chemistry between Ana and Christian is very believable.<br /><br />I found one major flaw with this book: I never thought I would say this but there was too much sex. To make matters worse, the sex was repetitive. The author's vocabulary seems to be very limited.  There was gross overuse of the words 'unbidden', 'heady', 'hot', 'down there', 'undoing, 'convulse' and 'release'.  I'm currently on book two and I'm a little disappointed that these words are still being used in abundance. I will continue on to book 3 though because I'm curious to see how the story develops.

B003H9MSPG|5.0|Some complain because it's billed as a sniper yet doesn't shoot farther than any other blaster.  Some complain that it stacks up poorly against the Longshot.  Some say it jams a lot.<br /><br />I say it's excellent.  First, Orange Mod Works makes an upgrade kit for it that allows it to shoot up to 70ft flat.  Secondly, see the first thing.  As for jamming, if you're quick with the bolt, and move it all the way back and all the way forward, you won't have any trouble ever.<br /><br />Also it can hold two extra magazines in the stock which is something other blasters cannot do.  And I happen to like the way the grip feels compared to other blasters.<br /><br />Yes, it does shoot better with the barrel extension off.  So does the recon. So did the Longshot.  However according to test fires that people have done on youtube, the barrel has no negative effects on the range once the Orange Mod Works kit is installed, which is great because this thing actually has both front and rear iron sights.  I still use it with the barrel off but that's just because i play indoors mostly.<br /><br />Get this gun.  Unless you can find an Alpha Trooper somewhere, get this gun.

0060574216|5.0|I hated men after few relationships. I felt cheated, thrown aside and physically abused. I Never thought I could ever love again...After 2 1/2 years I continue to put a wall up even though I was feeling alone and in need of a balance of a good man. I met someone as a friend. Didn't care for him that way. After being friends, I would give him attitude from time to time because I get annoyed. Maybe I took what was traumatizing to me in the past and if if triggered something from the past I get angry without knowing it. Even though he didn't understand why I acted rude at times even as friends, he knew my pain I went through. He remembered me mentioning my friends boyfriend was so sweet buying her flowers, champagne, chocolate over seas when we were miles away and had it sent to our room. It was the sweetest thing and I wish I had that kind of man. Little sweet thoughts count guys! For Valentines we were just friends. He wanted to make me feel special on Valentines day for what I went through in the past and know that men can be sweet too. He told me he was definitely not a romantic type but he surprised me with a candlelit dinner home cook steak dinner with wine, my favorite red velvet cake I love for dessert. He remembered things I said and took it and incorporated into some ideas for this day. He blindfolded me which was really cute! I never wanted to just give in just because a guy did that. I wanted to see what he was about and what his intentions are. I had past men treat me sweet too but I was abandoned and alone in the relationship. Also he knew I never been to Napa Valley. So he planned a continued a friendly valentines outting the following friday, with a trip to Napa. =) Had a wine tour, tasting etc. Then we had gone to SF for dinner with hotel and nightlife. We still haven't held hands nor kissed yet. And I wasn't planning to just give in just because...I learned to be smart because NOT all men care after they get it in and you know what I mean by that. hahah. We danced and got buzz and had some moments of a first kiss and held hands and he also took out a little ring for a memory of that weekend. It wasn't expensive of course but it was something to remember him by for that weekend. It was sweet and he slipped it on my finger. =) We were on the way home and I told him. I want to see how your like when you don't need alcohol to make a move on me. So he took that into consideration and he knocked out like a baby in the room. In the middle of th night he wanted to hold me but he knew he should wait till he is sober. =) He woke up in the morning to hold my hand and to fell asleep like that. =) I still had my guards up. Even for months we hanged out,  we cuddled and simple pecks but no make out sessions or anything! I wanted to make sure he was not in it for a little something something. And he was patience. =) He actually appreciated my company more then rushing to think with our hormones haha even though he told me every time I slept over he had a woody. haha poor guy but sweet to be patient. Of course it was over 2 years of ever dating a guy so after months of knowing this guy is considerate, knowing he reads this book to understand me and when we have small little issues we might have, he rethinks it. Aww. I'm no longer mean to him. I threw my walls down. Came into this relationship knowing that he is sweet and bettering himself and I am too. Every time I see him I get butterflies, I never thought it would be him I would go for but I know its been years and I never felt like this. My last ex, I hated that he would touch me haha. Yuck. =P But with him I can't take my hands of him. He takes care of his body, he sweet, considerate, he remembers to write down important things like the day we met, favorite food, my favorite color etc. He goes back to read them to remember them cus he has a bad memory but I think that kind of effort to do so goes a longggggg way. Is this my turn in life to be happy? I sure hope so. I alwaysthought I was never suppose to be happy in life but I feel different bout this one now. =*) This book did help him understand my thoughts and although I never read this book. I'm about to pick one up haha cus if he learns this much about a girl, I hope to be the best & coolest girlfriend ever too! =) God bless you John Gray! =*) ...happy tears

0439023491|5.0|If you thought Katniss and Peeta were safe now that they are home in District 12 after the 74th Hunger Games, then think again.  Catching Fire is the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins.  It's filled with as much excitement and action as the first instalment and won't disappoint if you are already a fan.<br /><br />The book begins with President Snow's dislike for Katniss for what he sees as a blatant act of defiance against the Capitol.  She had been the one who thought to end both her and Peeta's life with the selfless act of double suicide at the end of the 74th Hunger Games.  It was not quite a Romeo and Juliet moment but close.  They would have rather died together than kill each other as the Capitol had wished.  However, without a winner, the Hunger Games could not be seen as successful, forcing the Capitol to accept both tributes from District 12 as victors.<br /><br />Even though the 74th Hunger Games are over and Katniss and Peeta are both home with their families, their nightmares are far from over.  Unrest has settled over the districts, and in President Snow's eyes, it's all due to the victorious couple.  He had tried to use them to supress the people of Panem.  Instead they had risen up against unthinkable odds and given hope to people who had none.  This reminded me of the story of Spartacus.  He was a gladiator, doomed to die in the arenas fighting for the pleasure of the rich and spectacle for the people.  However, this all changed when he led a rebellion and became the leader of the slaves who worked to free the oppressed.  A stylized adaptation can be seen of this story in Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010).<br /><br />In order to not give the story away, I can't go into much more detail.  However, in Catching Fire, a new Hunger Games is about to commence, this being the 75th games also known as the Quarter Quell.  Every twenty fifth year the games are celebrated in a new way with varying rules, giving President Snow the opportunity to right what he has seen as wrong.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book, and if you liked the first instalment then, it's a must.  Katniss keeps up her portrayal of a strong female protagonist having a good head on her shoulders and determination that can't be broken.  It's nice to have a young girl that is smart and skilled rather than ditsy and reliant on a boy.  If you haven't picked up this book yet, give it a try; you won't be disappointed.unity to right what he has seen as wrong.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book, and if you liked the first instalment then, it's a must.

0805079831|5.0|A sickening read describing how Milton Friedman's economic theories, put into reality by primarily Republican Party members such as the second President George Bush, have consistently produced failing States instead. Iraq is one example the author discusses with plenty of evidence how by outsourcing government war and the following 'nation building' by using corporation employees in place of government employees, we promoted the theft of billions of taxpayer money through inflated billings while incompetent contractors look as if they are doing something to fulfill their contracts. Klein also shows how other governments, in trying to save themselves from a variety of economic crises, employ Friedman's horrible policies, imposed on them by various international powers and banks, end up impoverishing the citizens of those countries while foreigners and homegrown elites end up extracting most of the wealth created to their own bank accounts. The shock doctrine is forcing a country to sell off most of its assets by taking advantage of natural disasters or intentionally created financial crashes which bring a country to its knees. When a country is faced with a sudden disaster where many people are suddenly out of work and governments are stunned by the suffering and fear and destruction, banks and corporations move in and rape the country while promising to fix the problems with cash borrowed at high interest, imposing strict limitations on social security, fuel supports or food subsidies to the poor. The banks also force the sale of publicly owned electrical grids and water and sewer plants to private foreign companies and countries, who then fire the local employees and raise the price of the heretofore affordable necessities of daily life. Poverty rates typically jump from perhaps 10% to 30-60%. While the people are shocked by the disasters, they meekly allow the foreign corporations to steal their assets and starve them. Friedman promoted using the most extreme methods to deepen the shock and upset, through what used to be called brainwashing methods, which in actuality means torture of the kind used at Guantanamo in Cuba by the USA on the suspected Muslim terrorists, to destroy anyone who felt like protesting being put out of work and starving. In other words, a troubled country is forced into deeper, more painful difficulties intentionally in order to force the selling at rock bottom prices of everything of value to business entities which have no interest in helping or saving the country's citizens. Friedman thinks it will improve the functioning of everything eventually; however, Klein demonstrates in example after real world example (Brazil, Argentina, Iraq, Indonesia, Thailand, and others) how Friedman's theories put into practice destroyed the lives of millions of people and enriched only the top 1% , and along the way brought unbearable suffering.ods to deepen the shock and upset, through what used to be called brainwashing methods, which in actuality means torture of the kind used at Guantanamo in Cuba by the USA on the suspected Muslim terrorists, to destroy anyone who felt like protesting being put out of work and starving.

B006W0QOF2|5.0|A lot of people think that this film is too \\"artsy\\", I say that's BS.  It's a great film really, not artsy at all, but you need to have a modicum of intelligence to know that.  It's not artsy, you're just not smart enough if you don't get it.
B0070Z4M4I|4.0|This was a worthy prequel to \\"The Thing,\\" John Carpenter's '80s film treatment of \\"Who Goes There,\\" the great short story by John W. Campbell.  The major plot points are pretty consistent with the '80s version.  A main distinction is the method employed in each film to detect which humans have been body snatched into aliens.  Each was clever in its own way.<br />The special effects were quite good, nicely gross.  If you're claustrophobic, this movie might not be the best choice.  Otherwise, enjoy.<br />As an aside, I highly recommend the original short story, \\"Who Goes There.\\"  A timeless page turner, that one.

B004LROUW2|4.0|I hate to admit it, but I don't have a clue what this book is supposed to be about.  I think it is one of those books about which readers say, \\"This is a book that judges you.  You do not judge it.\\"  In that case, the book is probably judging me pretty harshly since I did not get it.  I'll probably be thinking about it for weeks to come, though, and wondering, \\"What, exactly, did those little people mean anyway?\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, I really enjoyed reading it.  That may sound surprising, but it's true.  I did not care for either character at the start of the book, yet by the end, I was deeply attached to both of them.  I loved the setting and the bizarre story line.  The ending melted my heart.<br /><br />Although I think this book would have been twice as good if it had been half as long, Murakami's restrained writing style grew on me.  Despite the violence and frightening qualities of some of the characters, the book had a tranquil feeling.  This was the first Murakami book I've ever read, but I believe that I will be going back to read more.
B0013O123Q|1.0|i was very disappointed by this movie. I personally don't like french movies, but this one had so many reviews and i happen to like both main actors, so i thought i would give it a try. What a waste it was! The beginning (which was supposed to be the end) gave me eye problems with all the red lightening on and off (not to mention the same question being asked over 20 times) and the end (which was supposed to be the beginning) made my head spin.. there wasn't any lesson, any message or even any point of this movie. The raping lasted for 15 minutes, over and over again.. well, we got the point there, it was a repeated rape!!! absolutely disgusting in my opinion! i think to rate this movie good, you have to be sick! I am just disgusted! I decided to watch it till the end with the hope that there will be something nice towards the end.. dream on! it was just 10 min between two normal people waking up probably worth seeing. Don't waste your time or money! X
B00006ADD5|1.0|This is World War ONE movie; no one wants to see a World War ONE movie; nobody.<br /><br />Indeed, as soon as I saw the airplane with TWO wings, I knew that I was in for trouble; no one wants to see a World Ware One movie; if they did then how come there are hundreds more World War TWO movies for every World War ONE movie?<br /><br />Also, there were no love interests; maybe if the film was made today they could show that Lawrence was probably a homosexual and given greater weight to his friendship with those two teens.<br /><br />Also, the film is racist in showing Arab administration of Damascus; the Arabs actually ran the city for two years, not two days as this racist film shows.<br /><br />Skip it.

Brings out a lot of new and old feeling between the brothers.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|As an experianced lifter of 2 years+ I didnt know if this was the book for me initially. I was looking for a kick up the backside with some guidance to get me out of the rut I'm in and this book is just that. Fantastically written, flows well and covers all areas of building your perfect body in simple, fathomable terms.<br /><br />I now realise where I was making a few small errors which equated to mediocre gains as opposed to the big ones we all want.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to people of all backgrounds/abilities serious about taking control of their body's.

She has songs that appeal to all her fans. Don't be greedy. She's not here to just please you. Realize all the different type of fans she has. I personally love her rapping and would prefer it to her pop but I am a TRUE nicki fan and will love her songs no matter what. Everyone changes, I bet your not the same person you were 10 years ago. You should support her and if not she'll have other supporters! Just remember, she is your leader, you not a believer... Well you get the rest. Go nicki, do your thing!!! <3

Following this my tablet will be sluggish until I reboot it. Through process of trial and error I stopped all apps and narrowed it down to when this particular app runs, it causes an issue. I've attempted fresh installs and clearing the cache but none of this has been successful.

0646497855|5.0|I highly recommend Simone Braverman's 'Target Band 7' for those preparing for IELTS exam. It is written in easy to understand English with very clear instructions on what to do and how to do it.The book not only offers many useful ideas, supporting techniques and strategies, but also shows all the small details and traps to look out for in different questions of the test. It helps to understand how the test works and what the examiners are looking for in each section of the exam.<br />This book is a great review guide that can be read both before starting to tackle IELTS and after the completion of certain numbers of sample tests. Obviously, the book is based on a lot of research which has been summarized by the author.<br />Thank you Simone for your great work. I keep my fingers crossed for my upcoming IELTS exam.

B005LAIH4A|5.0|I really did not care for the full length movie editions of The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas.  And I am a really big Dr Suess fan, so I was really dissapointed by those.  (I'm sorry, but I even thought Cat in the Hat was just outright creepy)  Horton Hears a Who was, okay.<br /><br />The Lorax I thought was really good [for a kids' movie] heck, even for adults, I found it entertaining - moreso than any of the others.<br /><br />It has some really great songs; I especially liked the one about greed, how he just kept making money and making money, no matter what the consequences to anything or anyone.  I personally can't see how anyone can truly believe that teaching children that the most valuable thing in this world *might not* be money is a bad thing.<br /><br />And ~GASP~ how dare we teach children to care about our planet and our environment?!? Seriously?  There has been so much harsh criticism of this movie, and now that I've seen it, I just don't think all that negativity is warranted.<br />Don't worry, this is not a hard-core indoctrination brain-washing session, it's a fun, hopeful movie that stays very true to the *SPIRIT* of Dr. Suess and his book.  I thought the added story line was very cute and appropriate.  To all of the people who think it \\"deviated too much from the book,\\" - can you tell me how a good full-length movie could be made from a children's book that is 20 pages long and only has one story line?  (As all good children's books do not typically have sub-plots and secondary story lines.)<br /><br />My kids said, as we were leaving the theater, \\"this is our favorite movie this year.\\"  And as far as kids movies go, I agree.  I thought the person who did the voice of the Once-ler was fantastic, then I googled when I got home and saw it was Ed Helms - so great!  I didn't know he was such a talented musician.  I like him even more now.<br />Two thumbs up!<br /><br />***UPDATE**  RE: Blu-ray version, purchased in a Blue-ray/DVD combo pack<br />The Blu-ray version of this movie has several sound spikes, most noticeably one at the end of the Once-ler's \\"How Bad Can I Be?\\" song.  I'm not talking about how the songs are always louder than the dialogue, it's a huge, noticeable spike for about 1-2 seconds.  Very sloppy.  I don't mind spending money on movies, we enjoy them, but this sloppy lack of quality really bothers me.

This is what thrash music is all about and Overkill and Megadeth carry the flag into the next era with the next wave of thrash metal (Toxic Holocaust, Evile)  \m/\m/ The Electric Age is the finest thrash metal album I have heard since Iron Bound which is another stellar metal release.

B00006JL1Z|5.0|Mick Fleetwood is a genius! First Mick Fleetwood started one of the greatest blues bands in the world with Peter Green on guitar & vocals. That line up i think would of been bigger then Eric Clapton would of ever been but out of nowhere Peter leaves the band & Mick Fleetwood gets a new line up that is completely different musically & sells more albums then they could of ever dreamed & you have all of that line up's collection here. Great remastered version to replace my old 1 cd greatest hits with. This 2 cd set is all stellar stuff but the sound is so much more audiophile like. Crystal clear audio quality very up front & so much better then the old one that i have replaced.There are so many songs where they play soft & it's so clear it's like your in the sound room with them. All i can say is go ahead & get it nothing sounds better.

B001GSV3EC|5.0|Ok. I have to go back some but 3 great guitar players played in a band called the Yardbirds.Eric Clapton,Jeff Beck & Jimmy Page.Clapton left the band did many wonderfull things & made a staple of himself in the blues world. Jimmy made Led Zeppelin & the rest was history for him. Then Jeff beck went on to discover Rod Stewart & had his own blues/rock band called the Jeff Beck Group.Eric & Jimmy had fantastic carrers but now that they have gotten older they do less & less while Jeff Beck is more more more.Jeff may just be the greatest Guitarist in the world.Allways thinking outside of the box with his bends and dive bombs. Jeff can play anything & allways make you say HOW DOES HE DO THAT or HE CAN ONLY DO THAT IN THE STUDIO BECAUSE IT MUST BE A STUDIO TRICK.Well it's not & heres the proof. This cd is live in a small jazz club & he pulls out all the stops. Eric & Jimmy couldn't even dream of the stuff he is playing & really no one can. He is in a league of his own far above anyone else.No one looks like him walks like him or sounds like him. They are all 10 miles behind trying to look for his foot prints in the sand. JEFF BECK DOES NOT GET THE GUITAR THE GUITAR GETS JEFF BECK!

1595827684|4.0|I was very happy to see just how detailed this art book was.  It contains concept art of the major alien species, as well as commentary on how the final designs came to be.  The landscapes and area design paintings are a nice inclusion.<br /><br />The book is divided into sections by game, making it easy to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />The cover and binding feel well-made, although the high-gloss pages are fingerprint magnets.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the art is a little too small.  I often found myself squinting at the pages trying to make out some detail.
B007918P1E|5.0|After first being introduced to Epica in 2006 with EPs and Demos it didn't take long for me to realize how EPIC Epica really was. Though, at first, to my distaste I had never listened to Metal with growling in it but for some reasons Marc really grew on me and now to the point where I love hearing him entwined with Simon. Then again I still have trouble listening to any growling other than After Forever or Epica.<br /><br />My biggest concern with the other reviews concerning the growling is that Epica isn't just Simon, it's Marc and the other band mates, meaning; Epica would not be Epica with out the growling and to me it works every time. I have listened to Requiem For The Indifferent now about 5 times and every time I find something new I like about a song. I love Simon's voice but then I love the contrast that Marc gives. It makes her voice so much more angelic to my ears.<br /><br />I loved a lot of Design your Universe but by far I love this album a whole lot more. I just know that Epica has always had growling and it probably always will and I'm sure we would all love Simon by her self, but until she gets a solo album (if there isn't already one) I will enjoy all of Epica together.

B004SIMNF0|5.0|I have tried many camera straps.  The best of them is the [[ASIN:B0045J5AAC Sun Sniper Strap Pro, Black]].  If you like a strap that is the one, and the only one, I recommend.  This product is totally different and I love it.  It keeps the camera out of the way and yet at your hand.  It is simple to use and easy to carry.  Even a heavy camera is comfortable.  Nothing about this gets in the way.  The main reason I like this set up is that if I am carrying my bag I can carry it on my left shoulder and it has no effect on the usage of the camera.  With a strap I have the two straps on my left shoulder (the camera strap across my body) and they interfere with each other.<br /><br />Also, this rig allows me to keep my tripod quick release mount attached and lock it into the tripod quickly and without the hassle of a strap being in the way.<br /><br />For hiking this is a great set up and leaves your hands completely free.  The lock on the holster is secure and you do not need to worry about it letting go.  The couple lock on the belt is also very secure.  The entire rig is comfortable for long hikes or long days walking in the city.<br /><br />Overall I love it and highly recommend it to anyone.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|This is a great app for people who travel a lot or who deal with clients/coworkers/relatives/etc in a number of different time zones.  Not only does it show the time for just about any location on Earth, it also shows whether it is today, yesterday or tomorrow there and whether it is day or night in that particular city.  You can also advance the time so that you can find out, for instance, what your local time will be when it's noon in London.<br /><br />The app also has a world map (or optionally, a globe) which shows all the areas of the world that have the currently selected timezone.  It also shows the areas of day and night in real time.  The default is a plain green and blue map, but there is an optional satellite map available for download.<br /><br />The widgets work very well on my Motorola Xoom tablet, adequately on my Evo 3D phone.  One thing I would like to see is the ability to select which specific time zones are displayed on the widgets, as well as a 1x1 widget for a single, specific time zone.<br /><br />I might have given this app only 4 stars, but then I discovered, buried within the settings, that the developer explains in great detail what EACH AND EVERY permission is for!  (It's in Settings --> About PolyClock --> Permissions)  I have never seen a developer offer this much information about why an app asks for particular permissions.  I would give this app 6 stars if I could just because of this.<br /><br />(For those who were wondering, the Fine (GPS) Location permission is for finding your current time zone in situations when your network location isn't available (and this can be disabled), while the Internet Access permission is for looking up locations not in the internal database and for downloading the optional satellite map.)

B0074EIQUG|5.0|A ball of fire continues to reside within Dr. John, casting a poetic divergence between the artist and the title of his new set of tunes. \\"Locked Down\\" is a blazing fusion of highly literate, funky, southern-fried Americana, blues, pop, soul and R&B that shows the venerable New Orleans-born musician in full creative force, with each detail invigorating, precise and carefully-honed.<br /><br />One can only hope that Nonesuch (this marks Dr. John's debut on the label) will know how to market the album correctly. \\"Locked Down\\" has the power to please not only lifelong appreciators of his verve and dexterity but has the power to reel in new listeners as well.<br /><br />The life force that has Dr. John sounding remarkably invigorated at this later stage of his career has much to do with Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, who assembled great players such as drummer Max Weissenfeldt and bassist Nick Movshon. They support him and this solid collection of tunes with passion and professionalism, causing the ingredients to slip into place like puzzle pieces.<br /><br />The fast-moving set of ten tunes sounds ripe for the 70s LP album market in more ways than one. \\"Getaway\\" pulses with longing, grit and a hurts-so-good desperation that is downright infectious. \\"Kingdom of Izzness\\" is downright groovy and chilly, as is the dark social commentary of \\"Ice Age,\\" while the entrancing poetry of the title track is anchored by steady percussion and hearty guitar licks.<br /><br />There is a lifetime of experience in his voice and playing. When Dr. John sings a line such as \\"Don't take the easy road - there's no short cut\\" from the quietly insistent \\"My Children, My Angels\\" it comes with a specific and heavy weight attached to it that is instantly resonant. Aspiring musicians who want to know what a lifetime of devotion to their craft could culminate in would do well to heed that advice and pay mind to the music which surrounds it.<br /><br />Dr. John is every bit as part and parcel of American music as Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen. He has always offered more than mere entertainment, and \\"Locked Down\\" makes it clear that he remains very much present and in full voice, articulating important truths for those wise enough to be listening. This is music made purely for the pleasure of the craft, and that pleasure is perfectly infectious.erican music as Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen.

Instead the print version page fills slightly more than half the screen and the text is repeated again on the bottom of the screen.  We love the digital Dr. Seuss on our ipad. This version is the exact opposite of that, nothing added and the pictures are tiny. Need an option to remove redundant text bar. Pass on the digital edition until they can get this right.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|This is one of the profound books that I have ever read. I think it should be a require reading in every high school. If I could talk to any one in the world it would be President Mandela. A man with more courage than any man dead or alive. He showed that he was willing to do whatever it took.I salute him and the ANC and the people who beleive in what he was doing.
0385535139|1.0|Right up to the predictable, syrupy-sweet \\"and they all lived happily ever after\\" ending, this book is not worth the paper it's printed on. Save yourself the time and the money.
0545405777|5.0|The Hunger Games seems to be very similar to Battle Royale. Both are set in the future, and involve children fighting to the death. Collin's book is not a rip of Battle Royale, but much rather a book with a similar plot idea. I do not want to give away too many spoilers, but how Collin's presents the characters of district 12, and how they are living in poverty, makes you really feel for the people and their struggle for living. The moment you pick it up you do not want to put it down until it is finished. The way Katniss's thoughts are presented throughout the story helps you better connect to her and the overall story/history of the games. You would think that there would be a large of amount of confusion with all the different roles of the characters, districts, and how Panem is setup, but enough information is given to give you the sense of what is going on (nothing is worse then a poor introduction of a plot). Overall, The Hunger Games is a well-written book, and i highly recommend reading. Oh, and go watch the movie when you are done!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Puzzles range from easy to very challenging, so it never really gets boring. Fun to go back and try to get three stars on each level...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I actually would give this book a 4.5 rating. I have to admit, I was a little put off by this book at first. Even though it isn't THAT gory, a lot of people are brutally killed. This book takes place in the future,there are 12 districts that are controlled by the Capitol. Each district specializes in something; fishing, mining, clothing, etc. Also, each district struggles, is poor, and is completely powerless to the Capitol.<br /><br />Every year, the Capitol holds \\"The Hunger Games\\" where a boy and girl from each district is chosen at random to fight to the death in an arena. It is very gladiator-esque, but very different and unique as well. Katniss Everdeen is our protagonist of the story. She is a very real character; strong at times, weak at others. I was hoping that all of the kids would fight back and not kill each other... but that wasn't the case. Besides that, I still couldn't put the book down. I don't really like to read gruesome or futuristic type books, but I've got to say this one won me over. After seeing the movie, which was probably the best book adaption I've seen today, I jumped into the second one which was EVEN BETTER. This is one of those series to lose yourself in. Dive in book lovers!
B004WR125O|1.0|Plugs right in but good luck getting good signal! Thing is CONSTANTLY buffering! What the hell is the point if it is always buffering? Skips constantly! Better off plugging in directly. Or using the RJ-45 Port.
0545123275|4.0|I was unsure about this book at first, some teen werewolf/ vampire books have simply been overdone and aren't original (not that there is any vampires in this one). This is a love story about Grace and Sam; Sam being werewolf, Grace being human. This was just one of those books that I was happy to read. Even when nothing crucial or crazy was happening, the book felt cozy. Does that make sense? It felt like home a little bit. It was just a very enjoyable fun read, I didn't expect to be buying the trilogy after reading this, but I did. Oh, and the ending just felt perfect to me. :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I pounded through this final installment in less than one day! Don't get me wrong...this book is enough of a page turner to justify such antics. However, when I finished, I felt 3 things: Relief, Fulfillment, and Regret for not savoring every word! Take your time devouring this book. It is true that some of the erotic scenes were slightly redundant and a few of the character descriptions were at times overwrought. But overall, it was an above average story line with enough suspense and reality to make it an addictive page turner. The story develops with a methodical and moderate pace. If you simply follow along with the story without assuming or fearing that something bad will happen or the world will come crashing down on your favorite characters, then this final installment to the Fifty Shades trilogy will leave you pleasantly surprised and begging for more novels by E.L. James!
0671027344|4.0|Over a decade ago, when I attended high school, I was most definitely a wallflower. And because of that, I was ready to fall in love with this book. I knew what it felt like to purposely stand on the sidelines, to observe all the high school drama without getting involved, and to actively try my hardest to be invisible. I thought, surely I would have a personal connection with a book entitled [[ASIN:0671027344 The Perks of Being a Wallflower]]. But the book didn't live up to those expectations. Perhaps my expectations were too unfair. Everyone's high school experience is different, even among the wallflowers.<br /><br />The novel is told as a series of letters written from Charlie to a mystery recipient, an unnamed friend, and the novel tracks Charlie's entire freshman year of high school. For a wallflower, he certainly experiences quite a lot of life. He befriends some seniors. He is initiated into this group of friends who frequent the Rocky Horror Picture Show. He parties and has his first experiences with drugs and alcohol. He even awkwardly navigates having a girlfriend. In one year, he goes through an entire spectrum of firsts.<br /><br />The book touches upon what seems to be every conceivable hot topic issue for teenagers in the early 1990s, including homosexuality, suicide, and abortion. If the book were written today, that list might also include bullying and school shootings.<br /><br />Charlie's voice reminds me of the narrator in [[ASIN:1400032717 The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]], except that the narrator is better and much more endearing in The Curious Incident. Still, Perks is very readable and the novel is quite entertaining and enjoyable. There are some quotable \\"truths\\" throughout this book that no doubt would appeal to teenagers, who may relate to Charlie better than I could.<br /><br />All in all, a nice coming of age novel. Not one that I absolutely love, but still a solid read. I suspect that it would appeal more to teenagers and more specifically teenage boys.and more specifically teenage boys.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|I actually would rate this cd between 3.5 and 4 stars.  I heard their song Ho Hey a few days ago and got very excited for this release and I was not disappointed.  The Lumineers have a great sound that reminds me Mumford & Sons, The Head and the Heart, and at times, Fleet Foxes.  I make comparisons to these bands only because I have found and heard great music as a result of checking out bands that are similar to music I already enjoy listening to.  Their self-titled album has a very spirited, upbeat (even in the slower tempo songs) mood that is very infectious.  While I would not say that it is unlike anything I have ever heard, I would be comfortable saying that I thoroughly enjoyed it the whole way through and it is only growing on me with each listen (as most good music does..IMO).<br /><br />Favorite tracks: Dead Sea, Ho Hey, Slow It Down, Flapper Girl, Morning Song
B000F7CMQ8|4.0|John Ford knows how to draw the veiwer into an authentic experience...he keeps the pace moving and lends danger and excitement to the story line with excellent direction.  Ava Gardner is breatakingly gorgeous, charmingly funny and endearing as the spurned lover. Grace Kelley, just before she makes it big,is excellent as the naive English wife of an anthropologist come to Africa for a safari to the far off and dangerous gorilla country.  Kelley is bowled over by Clark Gable, who is at his masculine best, and very believable as the Hemingwayesque white hunter who beds safari wives under the very noses of their husbands. Evidently the stars were switching beds during the shoot, too, including Gable and Kelley.  Maybe that's why she's looks authentically in love with him.  Great adventure, romance and scenery...a wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon.
1433502410|5.0|I cant really add much more than what has already been stated but this is simply the standard by which all study Bible's should be judged.  It gives the best book intro's, the most extensive notes and they are by far the most balanced in my honest opinion.  One feature that many like is the end of the Bible, all the extra features like doctrine, ethics, apologetics, etc.  I personally have not used those extra pages much, but it is great to know I have the option just in case.  With so many great study Bible's available such as MacArthur, Reformation, NLT, and others, this is a step above the rest.  While you cant go wrong with many Study Bible's, simple things set this apart such as the format, the color of the text, the pictures, the distinction between the text and notes, etc.  They put a ton of thought in this and while nothing can replace my Thompson chain reference, this my second in command!
B004DL5K2K|5.0|Actually this is the best. The Guitar is the original Randy Rhoads, the songs are the original recording plus bonus features. Rhoads and Ozzy Congratulations on the excellent work and congratulations to Ozzy for reviving this disc with the original version, the fans deserve it. This work is necessary on the shelf of any fan of Ozzy.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love fruit ninja it is probably one of the best apps out there. litarally. if ot halfbrick studios would make another fruit ninja like furniture ninjia or animal ninjia or something. I have all the blades. I wish you could unlock more blades though. it gets boring after u unlock all the blades...then there is no point of playing it. I would get it if I were u. it even is free!!!!!!!!
B003UDP9A0|5.0|Wow not only does this come with the amazing sound quality of SHM-CD technology, it comes with excellent packaging!  It comes with the original garage days re-revisited 5.98 EP mini LP cover too. It has the full lyrics booklet in English and Japanese! The Japanese sure know how to treat music. Get this if you love Metallica.
B001VLXNLU|3.0|Okay, so I loved this book. I'm only giving it a 3 star, though because I love series books and this one was great, as well as the next couple in the series, but then they just go down hill, and they are 10 bucks each, which really sucks because I've already fallen in love with the characters, but then I'm paying a ton of money and hearing the same thing over and over again. So, it's hard for me to rate this first book as only a 3 star cause I really did love this first book, but if you're like me then you want to enjoy the entire series, and they really go down hill. There is some major grammer and spelling issues in later books, which I can overlook easily if I love the book, but 2 or 3 of these books should be combined. It is a bummer cause it seems the author is more into making a lot of money than providing a great story. I understand wanting to make good money, but 10 bucks each for books that could be so great is frustrating. I fill a bit jipped because I won't pay 10 more dollars. I stopped at book 6.
B006NFKUF6|1.0|I have no idea what the heck you people have been smoking but this game is ridiculous.  You can not even punch anyone and you only throw shuriken.  This is a huge waste of money. DO NOT BUY!!!!
1612130283|5.0|So let me set it straight, yes I am a 20 something man in a relationship with a woman, who willingly read this book (and the entire series) in a total of 2 days. My girlfriend is a total Twighard and forced me to read that series; I admit I read the first two in a couple of days, but I quickly found the 3rd and subsequent unable to finish. The point being, I know a bit about Twilight and definitely had that as a reference when reading this book.<br /><br />Mechanically, the book is sound. The diction the author uses is definitely better than Twilight, its more sophisticated, much deeper. You are able to imagine the scene, the characters, the mood very readily. The repetitive nature of the some words and phrases may get tiring at some point, but the intent is to help readers establish connections the characters make, they help create an overarching \\"theme\\" in the entire series.<br /><br />Plot wise, James knows how to hook you. The beginning of the Fifty Shades of Grey is a little slow, bur crucial to setting up the story and the characters. There are subtle hints that you will pick up on knowing the general plot, but you will also go back and snicker at the little detail you only become aware of later in the series. In addition, there is just enough mystery to keep you turning the page; those lost in JJ Abrams TV shows like Lost and Fringe know all to well the feeling of being presented questions and no answers. Gracefully, all questions are answered at the end of the series, to a good degree of satisfaction, you just have stick through it which shouldn't be a problem. What was also amazing was how James was able to make you feel for the characters. For me, there were mirrors to my own relationship, making me realize how much I love and adore my girlfriend. You can almost picture the couple, the story, in real life....except for the erotica.<br /><br />Yes, I was mostly hurried for the first time sex pops up in the book. Yes, besides the answers to questions, I washoping to turn the page and read about more sex. However enjoyable it was to read, most of it is unbelievable, not the kink factor, but the way the relationship grows, how things happen, the high standards set for most men and women to perform in bed. The sex was a fun part of the book, but as it dragged on, it really didn't get any better.<br /><br />Finally, I bring up the references to Twilight. There are many, just really subtle ones though. You won't find vampires or werewolves, just people. That helps it be more believable. The personalities of the characters are similar, their weakness and actions also. It was a very clever tactic in order to get Twighards to read the book, but it is up to the reader to find the similarities and references themselves, which is a big part of the fun and allure of this book.
1469984202|5.0|I had just got done with the Hunger Games when I first read this series of books on the kindle.  It is a wonderful series of books!  I really could not put it down once I started.  These books are a must read if you liked the Hunger Games!  However, I like these books more; they were a little deeper, and made you think more about everything.
B007EC27QM|5.0|love this app. I use it to balance simple sums on my job. very clear and easy to read. highly highly recommend
0375703764|5.0|I first read this book when it was a new acquisition of the local library when I was in high school, and re-read it a few years later when I stumbled upon it while looking for another book on the library's shelves. Other reviewers who say it is a \\"challenging read\\" and \\"not for everyone\\" are exactly right. But, if you enjoy wrestling with a story to wring the meaning and truth out of it, this is the book for you. Nothing about this book is easy or transparent, and it will immerse you in a slow, creeping horror that will be difficult to recover from. You won't look at any house quite the same way again.<br /><br />Don't buy the ebook version - you'll deprive yourself of most of the fun of this book, the visual strangeness of the text alignment and justification is a huge part of the experience. But do buy this book. If you're like me, you'll find yourself returning to it every few years, every reading giving you a renewed sense of the mystifying and dangerous nature of existence and making you question and re-examine your perception of reality.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app is great for reading my pdfs on my Kindle Fire.  It really helps my work when I can take my Fire to lunch and work through lunch without being interrupted by my coworkers.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|easy to play games. nothing too serious. it helps me spend some time without comkiting to a major game..<br />i reccomend it
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Wow!  This movie still awes my children and I.  We went to see it at the theater when it came out, and took a few friends as well.  All of them left speechless (hard to do with young girls), it was that amazing!  We bought it when it came out on dvd, do not hesitate to buy this movie, it will be watched by adults and kids, with all thoroughly enjoying it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Like everyone is saying its a great game. But they better get more levels on there soon.<br />Its still a must buy if you have injoyed angry birds in the past.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Perfect ending to an incredible series (Firefly).  The show builds up to something, then never delivers...and then the movie came out.<br />Not only did it deliver, but it blew me out of the water.<br /><br />Greatest ending to one of the greatest Sci-Fi shows of all time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet.  This collection is a fabulous read.  Tons of fun, it held my interest completely.  I'm sorry to see it end, and really hope there will be more. My sincere thanks goes to the author.
B007H7XJD4|5.0|This was a really great movie with wonderful special effects!!! Great action film. It had me on the edge of my seat, cheering on the good guys!! I usually do not get so wrapped up in a movie, but this movie got to me- in a positive way. I was pumped up after watching it. Love feeling that way after a movie!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I don't know if it was me or if the book really got off to a slow start.  But I about fell asleep many times in the first half.  But the in second half the action picked up quite a bit.  It was a needed read to transition to the third book.
B007NCSJYW|5.0|I think this album is amazing only if you like both pop and rap. The rap ballads are great and when she goes into the pop parts the songs like 'Automatic' and 'Marilyn Monroe' i will admit they are a little too pop and bubbly but the rest of the songs are perfect dance songs in my opinion and their is creativity within the pop songs<br /><br />Im very glad i bought it you should too! it beats her second album by far if you like club pop and rap
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I must admit my mood has been sullen while I read these three books.  I don't think the last book was as well written as the first.  It did jump around some and was a little hard to follow at times.  I think the most haunting thing is that we could very well be headed in this direction if something in this country doesn't change and soon.  The last chapter has many thought provoking sentences in it that you may want to ponder for some time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you go into this book thinking it will be a literary masterpiece, you will be disappointed.  However, if you go in expecting a tale of a broken man and an innocent woman's journey to \\"fix\\" him and show him unconditional love with lots of bedroom (any room) sexapades, you will enjoy it.<br /><br />I personally feel the author did the characters justice.  I felt that you really get a feel for both Christain and Anastasia.  They are so different yet 100% made for each other.  You get to take their journey of ups and downs and understand both sides of it.<br /><br />I wasn't able to put these books down.  I am currently on the third and will be sad when I am done.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Being a movie buff, I always make an attempt each year to see as many of the Academy Award Best Picture nominees as possible, sometimes that means sitting through a few \\"chick flicks\\" if necessary.  But The Help had a couple of things going for it that drew me to it personally: the primary reason being that I was a small child during the era depicted in the film and I wanted to see if they got the details down right.  But there are so many more reasons to see The Help than just nostalgia; the first is a great story about the quiet people who went about their business, doing their jobs, while momentous events were happening all around them.  The second is a terrific cast of great actresses in great roles, even in the smaller parts: Octavia Spencer steals the show as Minny, she won the Oscar, but she is in some great company: Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Jessica Chastain, Alison Janney, Bryce Dallas Howard, Mary Steenburgen, and old pros  Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson have their best parts in years.  The third is a great script, based on Kathryn Stockett's novel, that gives it characters room to develop and drive the story, it never goes over the top or resorts to cheap feel-good sentiment; the cruelty and tragedy of the Jim Crow South is allowed to speak for itself.  And for some of the characters, there is no promise that life will be happy from this point on, just that life will go on, even though evil people get their way, and that is a triumph in itself.  There are some \\"chick flick\\" staples, especially in The Help's depiction of its male characters, with one or two exceptions, they are all weak, shallow and disinterested in how the women in their lives really feel.  I strongly recommend getting the Blu-Ray edition, which truly brings out the beauty of the Mississippi locations.  And yes they do get the details right, bringing back for me  that long ago time of Bee-hives and Bouffants; flip flops and RC Colas, and the Four Seasons blasting on the radio.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I enjoyed this game! it was very fun and a good time waster. I liked how you could buy upgrades and other stuff for your squirrel.
B006XBSAP2|1.0|Sadly this re-hashing of songs fails. The auto-tune is turned up to max. The tracks are redundant Very Disappointed in the album.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Believe it or not, some folks are just getting around to trying touch computers. If that includes you, I suggest Angry Birds, a game that demands you touch the screen in order to play the game. This game will get you out of the habit of reaching for a mouse. It is also very addictive. Bird heads pop up into a sling shot. You pull back on the sling shot, aim and let go. The bird head flies across the screen and hits various structures.<br /><br />The bird heads have different potential impacts. Some of them explode on impact. My favorite.<br /><br />This game can help fill time at doctor's offices, boring college classes, waiting for Godot, or you name it.<br /><br />Straight up Four out of Five.<br /><br />Get the adless version for real cheap. Staight up Five out of Five<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007O1GO8A The Gospel of Autocracy]]
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I <3 angry birds but I'm very disappointed..... the free version wont work on my kindle and I also tried it on my aneroid phone, sadly it doesn't work on my phone. The app makes my phone freeze up and the I have to take my battery out to get it to turn off. I think they should do a little work kn this app.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Welcome to the zombie apocalypse. World War Z shows the progression of a zombie apocalypse through a series of interviews that explore the experiences of survivors from around the world. Each interview or chapter further develops the story to paint the larger picture of a worldwide catastrophic event. Zombie fans and those that like post apocalyptic fiction in general will enjoy this book. You could substitute \\"zombies\\" for any number of apocalyptic events. It just so happens that zombies are the perfect enemy. A zombie acts on instinct alone, has no fear or conscience and will never stop until their brain is destroyed. World War Z (WWZ) is unique in a number of ways. First of all, the story is conveyed through a series of interviews and shows a wide variety of perspectives from people with different cultures and geographic locations. Unlike most stories in the genre, World War Z is not confined to one geographic location. Max Brooks takes us all over the world from China, Russia, Britain, Siberia, US and even to the ocean's floor. Another unique feature of WWZ is that it covers the entire war, from the early stages of the outbreak right up until the end where humans develop efficient ways to destroy the zombie hordes and take back much of the planet. WWZ also proposes some interesting ideas. For example, government authorities conclude that they cannot save everyone and that in order to save some people, others must be sacrificed. Although one could criticize the way in which the author proposes that \\"government authorities\\" would find and implement a solution for the vast majority, the harsh, pragmatic decision is logical in the context of this post apocalyptic scenario. WWZ is a unique, well written and exciting tale that I highly recommend you add to your list of \\"must read\\" post apocalyptic fiction.
B004UID2LC|3.0|the app works pretty well on the kindle fire but it crashes a lot. still wondering if downloading videos cost money

B005LAIH2W|3.0|Okay, everybody and their funkin' monkey has weighed in on this flick, so I might as well throw in my two shiny pennies, and see if I can ever get my wish for a reboot of the source material.<br /><br />Straight off, the film was not bad. It was a good little adventure. Fun...ish, but not amazing. It was not particularly well written, nor brilliantly acted, and for the amount of cash spent on the production, I was not terribly impressed with the production values.<br /><br />Most of you gushing out there in the 5 & 4 star reviews are not seeing the disappointment of the film. Not really. I don't see the Barsoom of the books, or much of subsequent visualizations of them over the last century. Sad really. Andrew Stanton and crew chose to ignore so much, (such as the Frazetta and Whelan depictions of Barsoom,) in the their art design that would have made this movie classic and timeless, but they ran on the hubris of their own artistic bearing, and the thought that there was an endless amount funds to make things right.<br /><br />I'm going to mention some films that created a world properly. Recently, (though I have issues with it as well) James Cameron's [[ASIN:B0044XV3QY Avatar]] put forth a visual like few films ever have. Regardless of the alien Dances With Wolves storyline, the look and feel of the film was gripping. So to with Peter Jackson's [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings]] trilogy, and it was fairly faithful to the source material, and had many powerful and evocative scenes throughout all three films. Riddley Scott's [[ASIN:B000K15VSA Blade Runner]], even after decades, and much controversy and drama in the production phase still stands up, and is as epic as it is dystopian. I could list other films, but these should suffice as converse exemplars of the problems within John Carter.<br /><br />And this is all said with a great sadness, because I wanted so much for this film to be better than it was.<br /><br />First, just to get it out of the way, the title sucked. Disney execs and Stanton should be ashamed. Secondly, the marketing sucked. There was no build up to the film with media and merchandising. Unbelievable. If Disney had done either of those properly, they actually might have made their numbers to make this a success. As it stands, as of the date of this review, the movie worldwide has made over $250 million. I feel it could have been a lot more, and thus there might have been sequels.<br /><br />So, let me get on with the scathing of the film.<br /><br />The art and style of the film was not horrible, just uninspired, when compared to the detail and vision of a production like Lord Of The Rings. The atmosphere and environs of the world of Barsoom, when compared to say, Avatar was flat and boring, and it did not have to be. (And this is coming from a person from Utah, where most of the exterior portions of the film were shot, and I LOVE our scenic wonders.) The landscape could have been built upon to make it far more fantastical and exotic, but the creators imagination faltered on that front. The acting was uneven from actor to actor, and the writing was similarly of mediocre caliber, scaled against something like Blade Runner. To me Taylor Kitsch looked more like another pulp hero in Conan The Barbarian, but without the Bad Mofo attitude. Lynn Collins was pretty enough, I suppose, but I would have rather had somebody with the exotic, feline face of Olivia Wilde, and the bangin' body of Heidi Klum in her prime. In any event, I can envision many other actors that could play the two lead characters far better. William Dafoe was fine for the voice of Tars Tarkas, however, but Dafoe can chew up scenery any day of the week. He's frickin' Dafoe, after all.<br /><br />Why do I make these comparisons to other films?<br /><br />Many reasons...<br /><br />But mostly because of the spendthrift production mindset and disrespect for the source material of the filmmakers.<br /><br />This film should never have cost this much. It was irresponsible and stupid on the part of Stanton and the production team, and they shot themselves in the foot, even if the film turned out halfway decent. But it is not fabulously awesome, mind-blowing, or jaw-dropping. Despite all the other glowing reviews on this site, the viewers of this film did not get the bang for their buck that production cost should have delivered.<br /><br />This film cost more than Avatar, for cryin' in the night!!! $250 plus bloody million!!!<br /><br />It should have never cost more than $160 million, even with reshoots. This should have been $120-100 million, if that. Films like [[ASIN:B00005JPLW 300]], [[ASIN:B007H7XJD4 Immortals]], and [[ASIN:B003RV43X4 Clash of the Titans]] were made for far less and had much more visual value put on screen. So disappointing.<br /><br />Add to that the shredding of the original Burroughs' texts, with only a general resemblance to [[ASIN:1598531654 A Princess of Mars]], and the film becomes almost insulting to diehard fans, who by the way, should have been the base the marketing and word of mouth this film should have been built on, but I digress.<br /><br />The general dearth of action that was the trademark of the book left me wanting more, and not in a good way. There was one scene where John Carter fights the Warhoons, and it was interspersed with redundant supposedly emotional flashbacks. The whole film, I was just waiting for him to cut loose, and show the John Carter I have grown to know and love, but no such luck.<br /><br />Oh, how I wish another studio and director had made this film. Please, please, please, New Line or Lionsgate, call Robert Rodriguez or Zack Snyder, or anybody who truly knows how to make action flicks effectively, and reboot this franchise!!! I pray to the Pulp Fiction Gods across the Multiverse that this will someday be so!!!<br /><br />For those of you who truly know the Barsoom books, I don't have to explain my dissatisfaction. This film was not how ERB penned his story, and yes, I understand that a film cannot be completely like a book, but it can be faithful, and congeal its essence, as in the case of Lord Of The Rings. Stanton did not do this, no matter how much he protests to the contrary. Even if they had strayed too far from the texts, but made a masterful script, I could have accepted it, but they did not. The script was middling at best. It wasn't too complex, as some have asserted, but it did have gaping plot holes, and stilted language that was not delivered with gravitas and sincerity. There was little of ERB's voice, and if the prose of Shakespeare can be delivered intelligibly, Burroughs' definitely can as well.<br /><br />Many reviewers have said they have read and loved the books, and love the film, and that's fine, but have you read them lately? I read all 11 just before the opening of the film. I was unimpressed with the conceptualization of the original stories. And that is just disheartening.<br /><br />As a person who has read the complete set of all 11 Barsoom books over 20 times, and the first trilogy over 40, I know of which I'm speaking. Over all, the film is a rollicking bit of fluff, with no depth. There is nothing wrong with that, but it could have been so much more. Some might say that pulpy fluff is what all Burroughs stories are in the first place, but I say poppycock to that! His stories would not have remained so influential if they did not strike a deep chord within many an artist's heart and mind.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am saddened by the combination of studio politics and myopic filmmaking that resulted in this film being just merely okay. If it had been done right, it would have been epic and classic and superlative beyond measure, but it wasn't. It was...okay. (sigh)<br /><br />With regret... 3 Stars.<br /><br />But that's just my opinion, and everybody's got one.s much. It was irresponsible and stupid on the part of Stanton and the production team, and they shot themselves in the foot, even if the film turned out halfway decent. But it is not fabulously awesome, mind-blowing, or jaw-dropping. Despite all the other glowing reviews on this site, the viewers of this film did not get the bang for their buck that production cost should have delivered.<br /><br />This film cost more than Avatar, for cryin' in the night!!! $250 plus bloody million!!!<br /><br />It should have never cost more than $160 million, even with reshoots. This should have been $120-100 million, if that. Films like [[ASIN:B00005JPLW 300]], [[ASIN:B007H7XJD4 Immortals]], and [[ASIN:B003RV43X4 Clash of the Titans]] were made for far less and had much more visual value put on screen. So disappointing.<br /><br />Add to that the shredding of the original Burroughs' texts, with only a general resemblance to [[ASIN:1598531654 A Princess of Mars]], and the film becomes almost insulting to diehard fans, who by the way, should have been the base the marketing and word of mouth this film should have been built on, but I digress.<br /><br />The general dearth of action that was the trademark of the book left me wanting more, and not in a good way. There was one scene where John Carter fights the Warhoons, and it was interspersed with redundant supposedly emotional flashbacks. The whole film, I was just waiting for him to cut loose, and show the John Carter I have grown to know and love, but no such luck.<br /><br />Oh, how I wish another studio and director had made this film. Please, please, please, New Line or Lionsgate, call Robert Rodriguez or Zack Snyder, or anybody who truly knows how to make action flicks effectively, and reboot this franchise!!! I pray to the Pulp Fiction Gods across the Multiverse that this will someday be so!!!<br /><br />For those of you who truly know the Barsoom books, I don't have to explain my dissatisfaction. This film was not how ERBpenned his story, and yes, I understand that a film cannot be completely like a book, but it can be faithful, and congeal its essence, as in the case of Lord Of The Rings.

030788743X|3.0|A quick reading, retro-themed cyber chase through the dystopian future. How could you go wrong? Well, this book mainly doesn't. It presents some interesting themes about poverty, internet \\"immersion\\", and corporate dominance. However, it also follows predictable plotlines, and seems slightly juvenile for people who would appreciate all the video nostalgia. As a 31 year old, my tastes are definitely more mature. I read it briskly, and enjoyed it, but I wouldn't really recommend it for my fellow 25+ crowd.
0439023521|3.0|Shirley Jackson must be rolling around in her grave.  this book is just a rip-off and expanded version of her short story \\"The Lottery.\\"  the plot is old and tired.  while i found the first book interesting, the rest of the trilogy is a downer.  she should have stopped at the first book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not since Riverworld many, many years ago have I been so transported. The premise here is that people live beneath a desolate world in a silo that is so large that walking down the stairs in the middle takes two days to get to the bottom. But any way I describe this collection will give too much away and will not do adequate justice to what the author has done. He has created a realistic world with rules and mores and peopled with great characters.<br /><br />What he has also done for me is renewed my interest in mining the gold that Amazon has buried just beneath all those shiny new best sellers. Thanks for the suggestions, Amazon, this one was pure gold.
B002JVWR4A|3.0|My husband and I LOVE this show, and got into it late so we purchased the DVD's to watch at home.  The prices on these boxed sets w/ Amazon blow away any retailers you can buy from locally.  We did have an issue however with the first 2 DVD's in this boxed set, they were literally unwatchable they skipped so badly.  When I contacted the seller regarding this, no response at all!  Not good.<br />But, Amazon did stand behind the product and gave me a refund.<br />So two thumbs up for Amazon, two down for this seller.  Would not recommend buying from them.  Plus, we still have not seen those episodes and will have to reorder.  Really messed up our watching these episodes in order.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I think this game is awesome. Its a lot like Mario which makes it awesome. I would like if they come out with a second
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This movie is incredibly entertaining, good balance of action and humor. I wasn't expecting this movie to be that good and after watching it, I was glad I had to the chance to experience it on the IMAX Screen. If you liked the previous Mission impossible movies, you'll enjoy this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a genre I probably wouldn't normally choose to read but I am glad I did.  The story is very sexy and I was unable to put the book down.  I read all three books in less than a week!
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Firefly is one of the best TV shows, it is a perfect mix of Science Fiction/Fantasy and the essence of the Wild West and Western movies. Highly recommend this series, and wish it was allowed to continue.
0439023521|5.0|I bought all three books together. I read all three in one weekend and I really loved 1 and 2. The Hunger Games was a different and interesting concept and I love the characters.
0439023513|3.0|I read all 3 books in 8 days.  It was a wild ride from beginning to end.  I like how the capital city was one large arena to be played carefully by the rebels.  Makes sense given the games were so important for the series.  I'm not sure how anyone under 18 could process all that was said and done in the trilogy.  Seems more of an adult book.  Of all the characters, Haymitch seemed to be the most stable as he directed Katnis' and Peeta's lives.  Didn't see that coming until the end.  what this trilogy really says is war is hell, it destroys lives and no one is ever the same.  Some of the deaths in this book seemed forced.  There was no need to kill Prim and Finnick's death just seemed wrong.<br /><br />The best scene of the entire trilogy was the Snow/Cain scene.<br /><br />Overall, the trilogy was a great ride and I'm glad I spent 8 days reading it.  The Mockinjay didn't flow as well from the previous book in the series but the ending was worth it.  Two damaged people, Katnis and Peeta, somehow found their way back to each other to create a life.
0439023491|5.0|I loved both books 1 and 2 of the hunger games. Book 2 was a great read and kept me on edge over how it was going to end. I really enjoyed this book.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|Not only does it have pre-loaded places, but you can input your own cities and the system will search for them and once found, add them as clocks and pinpoint them on the globe. The globe is really cool even if it has limited actual utility.
B00785P2QC|5.0|After playing the free version of Virtual City so that I could learn how it worked, I knew I wanted this one. it's a great game for anyone who loves sim games like Sim City.
B007BT0RKG|3.0|There are only 2 buttons on this app: \\"Find my location\\", and \\"Download maps\\". That's pretty much all you can get from it. It's like you have all these AAA maps stored in your Android device.<br /><br />Features? next to none. You cannot search for address, don't even think about navigation.<br />I also think it would be nice if user can update downloaded maps when new map data available. at this time I have to delete cached maps, then re-download them again to get the latest maps (there's no way to tell if  new map data become available at server side).<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. You get world maps for free. The foreign maps are in their native languages.<br />2. The maps basically work, you can zoom in for details street names, or zoom out.<br />3. The maps are offline cached, meaning that you don't need WiFi hot spot or 3G data plan to check maps. You do need GPS to find your location.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Lacking of standard features of digital maps.<br /><br />If the developers add \\"search address\\", this app will get 4 stars, if they add navigation (even the very basic navigation with GPS, i.e., text direction only, no voice/speech), it will get 5 stars.
B0073XORLU|5.0|Fans of the classic 1972 album won't be disappointed.Rather than an extention of the first album this is a reflective piece, and the songs flow together seamlessly. Nice song writing and interesting use of musical instrument give it that clever feel associated with Ian's better work. Great job, plenty of musical ideas and look for a fun wrap up at the end.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has 101 games. that's. awesome<br /> Cummings that's awesome rite.  boa boa boa blab boa boa blab boa boa boa.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it freezes a lot on my kindle fire and when I restart it the hours get pushed back significantly. please fix this issue. I now have to wait 14 hours to play -__-. Other than that I love love love this game!
B007N5YIUS|3.0|nice concept, but runs slowly and horrible ads. at times it is so slow that it effects the game timing. the ads also obstruct the game play rather than just taking up an unused part of the screen
145162445X|5.0|I saw God at the unemployment office yesterday.  Lawrence Krauss has successfully taken away God's last claim to creation.<br /><br />This book is entertaining, funny, and rather deep.  It will definitely require multiple re-reads...but in the best of ways, of course.  Since reading this book, I've become a huge fan of Krauss and am looking forward to more of his work.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Worst version of game to date.  Locked up my motorola zoom.  Fi<br />nally got it to main screen and started to play.  Locked up again.  Bad game.  Developer needs to patch this game.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The plot is absolutely predictable, and there aren't really any \\"twists\\" that you don't really expect. This is hugely due to the fact that the characters don't really develop or surprise you. The tributes all \\"stay in character\\" and don't really show any depth at all.<br /><br />The book is entertaining and a page turner, but the plot really is lacking. I would aliken the book to an action movie - fun to watch and read, but it doesn't leave you with much to actually think about.
B004AOECUG|3.0|I like boxing and other sport based movies, I am an avid movie watcher and I tend to watch a wide variety of movie genres and based on the reviews I was expecting a lot from this movie. Admittedly I am not a huge fan of black and white which I knew this movie was going to be but in a nutshell I just found this movie semi-boring. If you are used to more action oriented and faster paced movies this may not be your cup of tea either. Like some of the other reviewers I don't understand the hype but to each their own.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I've been waiting for this album, impatiently, I might add, and now it's here. I've listened to the whole album about 8 times already today. Makes me think of dried leaves, cold islands, warm blankets, & tree shadows. It's been a good day :)<br /><br />Now, I keep seeing this band compared to Arcade Fire, and that's fine as a point of reference. So, in that vain, I will continue. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being there's no way on earth I would listen to this band and 10 being I'm in love with this band and want to have it's children, Arcade Fire sits at a solid 8.5 for me. I also have a special spot on my scale which is 15 and that is reserved for those I would pawn all my valuables just to see them live and currently only Sigur R&oacute;s and Arsenal FC are that high up :)<br /><br />So, Of Monsters and Men sit right at 11.5 for me. That's how much I love them and this new album. They will be on HEAVY rotation on my ipod for a long, long time.<br /><br />So, why haven't you bought this album yet??
B000ID1J0E|5.0|This book should be studied in Modern Literature classes. Our generation needs to read and study this book. It captures the experimental nature of the 1970s and the downfall of American society, thus the loss of the American dream. The monumental discovers made by Thompson on the modern world need to become the new chapters in history books. And most importantly, we must apply Thompson's eye witness documentary of the fall into today's society to learn from America's mistakes.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0679785892 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream]]
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love angery birds more than anything it is my favorits game. If I had to change one thingabout angry birds I would make a app where you can create your own levels that would be cool. If I was could  I would play this game all day but I can't work gets in the way my mom she is 69 and she plays angery birds all day while I'm gone you should get this app.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|no forced closes.  no lag.  super addicting. works perfect on my kindle fire.  I have come across an element or two not appropriate for children.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this.  it has all kinds of cool games on it. but it has a score limit. so if u want to get points, you need a high score
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|I have a new MacBook Pro and needed this adapter.  It works great.  The price was fine.  I could not be happier with this product,  It was delivered quickly.  I highly recommend this adapter.
030745455X|5.0|I thought \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" was good.  But this was fabulous. Lisbeth has left an imprint in my mind that I will never forget.  Now on to \\"Hornet's Nest\\".
6305252572|5.0|It takes two to tango, and 48 Hours features the superb pairing of Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy.  Both actors are arguably at their peak - Murphy making his debut before his silly laugh became his trademark, and Nolte careening at his dishevelled best.<br /><br />The pair's gritty conviction and humour absolutely drive the film. The word \\"politically incorrect\\" has been used to describe the film's characterizations, but the chemistry of Nolte and Murphy transcends everything. Everything.<br /><br />Armed with Walter Hill's masterful action packed direction, a great script, and real bad guys (James Remar menacing as the cop killer), they just don't make films like that anymore.  Walter Hill brings the Wild Wild West to San Francisco, and his gunfighter instincts serve him well.  There are no wasted moments in this show, and no dialogue that shouldn't be in there.<br /><br />48 Hours is the real deal - a classic with few, if any peers in the buddy cop genre.
0307454568|5.0|What a way to end the story.  Best series I've ever read.  And I get the impression that had Larson lived, there would have been more for him to tell us about Lisbeth.
B005HSL626|4.0|this game is like so awesome on the kindle fire personally I'he never had problems with it I just think its a challenging fun game.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Problem has been fixed and I love Wolfram Alpha, maybe add keyboard customization option : )<br />Keyboard buttons are little too big for my linking, Wish there was an option to shrink their size.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|5 gold stars is the way to go! to good to be true! my friends will love it! to good!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game. Lots of tile choices and numerous levels and game choices. I have not seen the ads some of the reviews complain. about maybe those are the free versions. I highly recommend and I play lots of Majong games this is my new favorite.
B001VLXNLU|2.0|I've read the first 10 chapters of this book. I got very sick and tired of the constant complaining about the \\"People of Faith\\", that was the thing that made me end up putting the book down. Obviously the author has issues with Christians, and taking it out on them in a poorly written book isn't very amusing.  Which brings me to: the writing is TERRIBLE. One line talking about a woman with \\"nice boobs\\" ended with \\"(Boob.. heehee)\\". Really? What are we, 8? I think after the first couple of chapters of a book I should be comletely into the story and turning pages with eagerness to find out what happens next. I've been forcing myself to turn pages since page 1.<br /><br />I think the plot is semi-interesting, it could've been a good story, but poor writing ruined it for me. I was very disapointed. I saw the bad reviews and still bought this because it was recommended to me by someone I know. I did not finish it; I dont know what happens in the end and I don't care at all to find out.<br /><br />I usually don't leave reviews but I was so disapointed I felt the need to. I can't even say this is only good for 10 year old girls, because if I had a 10 year old daughter I wouldn't want her reading about some blonde girl on her knees in front of a guy, to put it nicely, and I dont know what all else happens after chapter 10, so I'm not sure what audience should attempt this. Maybe 16 year olds who have no idea what good writing is. I don't know. I would just say invest your money in a better read.
0670023329|5.0|Shin was born in a North Korean prison camp, where he witnessed untold horrors and atrocities.  He was raised to inform on his camp-mates, saw his mother as a competitor for food and never experienced love or happiness.  Shin knew nothing of the world outside of the camp and believed that his life was a result of his parent's sins, ones he had to work hard and repent<br /><br />The story followed Shin as he decided to escape Camp 14.  Miraculously he made it through the electrified fence with only burns on his legs.  He traveled by foot and train to China, where he begged and scrounged for work.  After a while he traveled across China, looking for work, food and a way to get to South Korea.  With the aid of human rights advocates he traveled to South Korea and then America, where he began speaking about his experiences.<br /><br />I knew nothing about North Korean prison camps before picking up this book.  Shin story is heartbreaking and can hopefully bring awareness to this situation.  Overall, I highly recommend this book.
B005AUWY90|4.0|There is no disputing the fact that this is the worst of Pixar's films... but by any other standard, it's not a terrible movie. Sure, it's fairly shallow overall, and the plot is silly even for a movie about talking cars, but at the same time it's fast, bright and colourful and has a lot of action.<br /><br />I bought this mostly to complete my collection, and was surprised that I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. It has a lot of flaws, but when watching it, I never thought \\"I don't want to be watching this.\\" It was simple easy watching.<br /><br />Expect it to compare to the likes of Up and Toy Story, and it will be the worst movie you've ever seen. Take it in stride, and you might find it to be light escapism. I was going to give it three stars, but then I remembered it contains the wonderful Toy Story short: Hawaiian Vacation. That is easily enough to bump it up to four.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Awesome tool. No complaints at all. I use it on my Fire, my Pc and phone. It all syncs. Very convenient for taking notes and writing material. I recommend this to everyone. I even used it for homework.

B007BT0RKG|1.0|It did not do anything but 'hang' my KF. I had to hard-reset, then I immediately removed. No Help or Instructions. I could not get it to work for me.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|well  I have a coby  kyros and I was worried it wouldn't work after reading reviews.However that's not my case anyway.Mine is a coby 7022.I installed it then quit without running it restarted. my tablet and it works.I played a couple levels.. So far so good.
B007NCSQFO|3.0|Not into the pop stuff so much but Nicki seems to have a nice singing voice.  My favorite song is Champion, so I listened to the entire album once, & then just listen to Champion on repeat.  Seems she took a big risk here but I like what she did.  She may appeal to a bigger audience with this album, & maybe that was her idea all along.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have no idea what compelled anybody to put a negative rating. I would give it 6 stars if I could! You can basically get all the free music you want from this app and the ads are minimally intrusive. (They don't popup randomly as some reviews say) It's quick, simple, User friendly and effective. Thank you so much Micromacro!! You are now among my top companies :) Great app and free, worth the download.
B003L77GGU|5.0|The DVDs are in excellent shape, and they got to me in really good time. Great to work with, Thanks!
038533348X|5.0|I absolutely love, love this book! Kurt Vonnegut is one of my favorite writers - when it comes to irony, no one does it like him! Vonnegut's roots as sci-fy writer provide an imaginative setting for the story, and his sharp wit is simply irresistible. One of the favorite of Kurt Vonnegut's books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At the beginning I was hesitant of buying this book when I read some negative reviews, after a while i decided to give it \\"the benefit of the doubt\\"  ... it's true that there is a lot of sex involved in the story, but once you start  reading you realized that although an important factor in the story, it really becomes secondary, LOVE is the main one.. The story touch you in an unexpected way, it makes you realized that life  can be cruel, but there is always hope and people who love you unconditionally. I really LOVE this story, after finishing the third book I immediately started re-reading the first one
0446573019|5.0|I love David Baldacci's 'new super hero'..Lots of information on the coal  mining and the havoc it wreaks in West Virginia...no short, snappy chapters..just good old- fashioned terrific writing...having said that, I think his editors should know that impostor in not spelled 'imposter'...check it out and don't make David look  like a poor speller
B00004SVIK|5.0|Bought this when it came out and listened to it in my car on the way home from the music store.  I have a pretty loud system in my ride and it sounded great.  When I got home I put on my house system and cranked it...sounded way better!...not sure why fellow reviewers are saying it sounds like the original studio Wall?!?...sounds completely different and I think way better!<br /><br />Really like the beginning with the announcer...had the volume way too loud cause I thought my system wasn't working...scared the bejeebers out of me...what a surprise!!!
B006Z7Z3R2|1.0|Stay away,  very boring,  cast has the acting range of a daisy air rifle. I was very disappointed. I'm glad I only rented it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was simply amazing! Seriously probably the best story I've read this year, and I don't see that changing as the year goes on. It's beautiful, raw, passionate, and at times devastating. To say that this is a beautiful disaster...well there isn't much disaster at all to this...<br /><br />Abby starts her freshman year of college at Eastern U desperately trying to start over. She needs to live a life that is the polar opposite of her past life with her dad Mick. So no more drinking, gambling, and definitely no more bad boys. So with a wardrobe full of preppy \\"good girl\\" clothes Abby tries start over in a place where no one knows her or her father. But it doesn't take long before she meets Travis, the campus bad boy, and she falls back into her old life.<br /><br />The relationship between Addy and Travis is raw, chaotic, and at most times like a train wreck. You know it's not healthy but you just can't tear your eyes away from it. They both bring their own baggage and problems to the table and when they collide they are beyond a beautiful disaster, but it's perfect in it's faults. I couldn't get enough of these two and I know that this is a book that I will read over and over again. In fact this is one of those books that compels you to read it no matter what. Sleep? Who needs sleep when you have a book this good?<br /><br />And don't even get me started on how swoon worthy Travis is. Covered in tatts, picking fights at ever turn, but yet super smart at the same time he just took my breathe away. A perfect balance between the dark sexy side of a bad boy and the softer side of a boy that cares about people he loves.<br /><br />I do want to address one thing...<br /><br />Before picking this up I read some bad reviews of this book. It made me a little leery at first. The most common complaint these reviewers had was that the book was too violent. That there was too much unnecessary fighting. Well I couldn't disagree more with those people. We know from the synopsis that Travis is part of an underground fighting ring, and this is an important and vital part to the story. That being said yes there are graphic fight scenes in this novel but they are necessary to plot and make you really see the battle that Abby has when it comes to letting Travis in. I never once felt the scenes where overly violent. They were realistic and raw.<br /><br />Overall Travis and Abby were perfect together and I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in this series. And yes there were a few editing errors here and there. I few things that could be cleaned up, but never once did it take away from the story; has you can tell by my 5 star rating. Actually I would venture to say this is more of a 7 star book!psis that Travis is part of an underground fighting ring, and this is an important and vital part to the story.

B0067QPVD2|4.0|You know, I love the John Carpenter film. This IS A PREQUAL people. It is not meant to be John Carpenter's, nor is it remaking it. I just purchased this on Blu Ray today for $10. I actually love this film. I would have paid full price. I read most of the reviews on here. It may not completely bring back what the original or John Carpenter version did, but come on. This film is really fun. If you like alien films, this should be up your alley. I have high standards when it comes to alien films, due to Alien and Aliens. But seriously, get real, this film is pretty damn good. I stand behind it. As a real HUMAN, if anyone reads this, give it a shot, you will probably find yourself to be a entertained fan as well. The 1&2 star reviews are very, very biased.
B000002UTY|5.0|It is a shame that the sound is not that great but this is a good cd,classic San Franciso music of the sixties.
B006PTZNSY|5.0|I love this album. I love Nicki. I picked this up at 12:30. This is better than Pink Friday. In memory I spilled alchohol all over my floor, wall and curtains. I love this album. Barbz we did it, we spilled alcohol all over the place!! Nicking we managed to cumulative all over everything!! I love you!\\" Feature at your next concert!! OK, Roman!!!!
B006MGC3VK|5.0|This is modern music at it's best! Right up there with the best of the old and puposefully leading the new. This is entertainment that coats your entire being! Just can't say enough good things about the amazing work that these guys bring to our attention every few years! Thanks Kevin, Jim and Gavin! Well worth the wait! Love every track! Recommend getting all of their previous work as well!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great story writing is creating tension and Collins certainly delivers on this. Personally I am not a lover of sci fi but in this case it works well without being overkill.<br /><br />What really works is the story beneath the story. I hope that is not lost on the teenage audience.<br /><br />A good book and well worth the read.
B007J7LFTW|4.0|First off, I am not going to get into the \\"Anderson and Barre Split\\" debate.<br />Why would one? \\"Jethro Tull\\" has gone through probably 40 musicians on tours<br />throughout the years, and lord knows how many in the studio.<br /><br />Putting THAT albatross aside...<br />on this particular work, Ian Anderson takes us back to the sound<br />of Jethro Tull's golden (most productive) years.<br />(In my own honest opinion: Jethro Tull, the \\"group\\", hasn't produced<br />a really decent or stellar album since \\"Songs From The Wood\\").<br /><br />On TAAB2, Ian takes us on a \\"what-if\\" journey of \\"Whatever Happened To Gerald Bostock?\\",<br />the fictional character of the original \\"Thick As A Brick\\".<br /><br />The lyrics and musical writing that Ian provides, takes us back to what some (most?) of us have craved for many a year.<br /><br />I gave this album \\"only\\" 4 stars for the sole reason of sound production. It sounds, at times muddy, yet, at other times clear as a bell. I wish there had been someone to help Ian on the sound production to bring better balance and mixing.<br /><br />For those that are merely hung up on the \\"Anderson and Barre Split\\"...<br />you probably won't purchase TAAB2 anyway.<br /><br />For those that miss the sound of golden productive years of Jethro Tull (the band):<br />I highly recommend this artistic musical endeavor.
B000002KO3|5.0|Recorded in 1980 but still sounds utterly contemporary and ahead of its time.  Talking Heads and Brian Eno fused the brain of David Byrne's (appropriately) neurotic/paranoid/shattered lyrical concerns and observations with the body and funky soul of Fela Kuti's hypnotic rhythms, arrangements and chord-changeless song structures, resulting in a record that can readily stand as not just an essential recording of the 20th century, but as a work of art.  It is no minor feat that it also happens to be very listenable and danceable, effortlessly avoiding the considerable potential pitfalls of pretension and dilettantism inherent in such an ambitious, cross-cultural endeavor.<br /><br />\\"Fear of Music\\" and \\"Speaking In Tongues\\" bookended this style for the Talking Heads, the former being darker and more closely related to their earlier art school style, and the latter being lighter and more commercial.  \\"Remain In Light\\" towers over the rest of their impressive catalog as their masterpiece, and provides a rock/new wave parallel, to my mind, of the modal exploration of \\"Kind of Blue\\".
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Although written in typical King fashion this was certainly a let down from some of his best writings.  The premise was great and the subject matter very interesting but the mechanics and the overall story dragged and was not worthy of all the hype.  A good read but not up to snuff for King followers, Albeit a very high mark to attain consistently.
B00000AFFF|3.0|I first heard Elvis singing a Bacharach/David song \\"I just don't know what to do with myself\\"on the Live Stiff's LP and thought it was a great version.<br /><br />Consequently I thought a Costello/Bacharach collaboration would be fantastic however about only half of this works for me. Maybe because I have been spoilt by Dionne Warwick's beautiful voice on all those Bacharach/David songs.<br /><br />I remember an interview with Hal David where he did say that no-one has beaten him as a lyricist and he is probably right. Maybe equaled but not beaten.<br />Anyhow you don't need me to tell you Elvis is a genius but I find his vocal approach on this too much at times.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Re-editions are useful for new fans who maybe haven't purchased the album, and now they buy the original + the remixes and the new songs and is almost the same price, so i think it's amazing.<br /><br />I already have the original Teenage Dream, but i bought this because i want the new artwork, the three new singles and i love E.T. with Kanye West.<br /><br />Plus if you don't want to buy this album again, just buy the songs digitally.<br /><br />PS: Listen to the amazing Mash up including her six number ones. Is addictive!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The first and only remote desktop application I have used.  A little cumbersome at first but once i got use to it i was able to really enjoy the application.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is remarkable.  Although fiction , it gets you thinking about how things could have been if a tragedy did not occur.  But the final thing is changing this would be for the better or worse. Who would have thought it would have been for the worse.  Every action had a different reaction, and in the end it was best to leave it up to God to now what is best.
1401937519|5.0|I highly recommend everyone read this book. It was recommended for me and I hesitated because I have soooo many books I've purchased and not yet had time to read. But things kept happening that brought my attention back to this book so I figured it was a sign and I should read it. I also value Wayne Dyer's work very much and having him suggest it and write the foreword made an impact on my decision to get it as well. if it inspired him I knew this was something I needed to check out! I've read a lot about NDE's and consider myself on a very lengthy spiritual journey to seek truth and understand more about why I am here and what will help me to grow in all aspects of my life. While I do not have cancer I've struggled with some health issues and this book is applicable to almost any other struggle in your life-not just cancer. It is simple and a fast read. I will refer back to it again and again for reminders of how I am not \\"allowing\\" myself to heal and getting caught up in drama and details that are not important. I will also be giving copies as gifts. I am a mental health clinician and will  be suggesting this to many clients who struggle with low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and are questioning their place in this world. I found it very uplifting and it gave me hope. What a blessing that Anita shared her experiences so that others may benefit as well.

The stark differences between each of the books are almost dramatic with Mocking Jay being for me the darkest.<br /><br />Impossible to read on its own this book is not for the faint at heart. The Capital and the games are exposed for what it truly is... savage and downright brutal. People are slaughtered, tortured and left for dead. The whole book is bittersweet with elements that make laugh, sign and cry. Mocking Jay concludes this heart wrenching series the way one is meant to be ended... Hope with a future gained but not without cost; the very real price of loss of life.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Let me start off with this, it ONLY has a one star rating because it won't let me rate it 0 stars.<br /><br />As I was reading I was distracted by the unnecessary scene descriptions,{it read out like a play and it threw it off}, the old fashioned grammar,and the fact that Ana's character had no depth whatsoever ( I mean she is Bella...) This is pretty much all it is and on top of that, anyone who knows anything about BDSM and reads this will know immediately that what the author knows about BDSM comes from poor knowledge of internet research on the subject and as a memeber of the BDSM community I was highly offended by most of the inaccuracy in it. BDSM friends of mine who read this agree with me when I call it \\"cartoon bondage\\".<br /><br />I only read the book because I thought maybe with editing it would have improved. Mistaken. The only reason this story was published was because the publishing company knew when Twilight, Robert Pattinson, and Kristen Stewart are mentioned in connection with it, it would become an instant success. They were right. That part was brilliant.<br /><br />This is a perfect example of how you don't have to actually have talent and imagination to be an author. If I was Stephanie Meyer I'd sue.<br /><br />Silliness and a waste of money and time.

B004QK5N5W|5.0|I've been looking for a way to download movies without having to pay the monthly fee all the \\"services\\" require you to pay. (yes, I know I'm cheap).<br /><br />This, combined with a IPad and HDMI cable allow you to get movies from ITunes, and watch them in Hidef format. Works Great! BTW, my Ipad is a gen 1 (I think), so there is no \\"mirroring\\". i.e. you see nothing until you start the movie.<br /><br />BTW, Amazon also sells reasonably priced HDMI cables. I think it was about $6.

B004XANKVO|5.0|I have been through so many backpacks, and being in the military, when I can carry my laptop or need to carry it in my backpack, I never want to much stuff in the same place as my computer. well, after about 4 backpacks, i finally found this on a review website. Thule makes amazing products. I own this backpack, 2 laptop cases (one slim, one with pouches and a sling) and a shower bag.<br /><br />This backpack has a rear compartment specified for a macbook up to 17\\" (or in my case, a 15\\" with a thule case on it), an iPad or tablet, and a couple small pouches at the top of it (think magic mouse size as well as a thumb drive slot).<br /><br />the main compartment is very roomy, with a couple mesh pockets at the top (enough to hold a couple hard drives or cords & plugs). i can fit a set of clothes, food, running shoes and I'm sure a couple more items as well. all without making the bag feel bulky and loose. very well thought out.<br /><br />the top compartment is a hard shell with water proof zippers. it will fit 2 small pairs of glasses, or one bigger pair and some cleaning cloth. the front pouch is roomy and has a couple inside pouches as well as a waterproof pouch. also, there is room in-between the main compartment and the front pouch (just under the hard shell at the top) for anything that can be fit into an open pouch (jacket, shoes, I store my shower bag there) and the tightened. EVEN WHEN ITS LOOSE... this does not make the bag bulky. I have seen that many times on backpacks trying to be tactical and create more space. thule pulled it off. there is also a couple side pouches (open, for drinks or whatever) and a small pouch underneath the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />if you have ever owned any thule products, you know the quality of this bag already. the interior is amazingly soft, but durable and lined. the pockets in the rear pouch are lined with a durable but soft cloth. the back and the straps offer nice support, but the straps could have a little better form to them. the back is flat and padded.<br /><br />the only complaint I have about this backpack, is that they did not make at least the rear compartment (computer one) with a water proof zipper like the hard shell one. that would be perfect. I have already mentioned it to thules customer service.<br /><br />these pictures on amazon are not giving the bag any justice. so i have uploaded my own. please take a look if you are considering this backpack.m to them. the back is flat and padded.<br /><br />the only complaint I have about this backpack, is that they did not make at least the rear compartment (computer one) with a water proof zipper like the hard shell one. that would be perfect.

0439023513|1.0|After reading this I felt just as hollowed out and empty as the characters in this book. I was riveted, read it all in one day, waiting for peeta and katniss's reunion, the climactic fall of the empire, the characters growing and bonding together. But as we know that all happened 'off-screen' or not at all.<br /><br />* At first I thought the author was displaying katniss' weakness and insecurity at the beginning in order to show her dramatic evolution into a powerful war hero, the embodiment of the rebellion. but she never filled that role. Never really wanted to<br /><br />* Peeta and katniss' love story, was completely taken away. I was enthralled with it in the other books, it was so sweet and human, and was a remarkable contrast to the stark and terrible things that went on around them In the first two books. Here Katniss was cold, and I don't believe you could watch someone you 'love' go through with peeta's ordeal (a lot of which was to protect her) and not try to help. or even think about it that much. THe characters ended up hollow and ruined. They could barely stand to let one another out of their sight for an instant in the second book, here there is mutual disinterest. I thought his hijacking could've been a real opportunity for them to fall back in love, for her to try to win him back. There was barely a nod in his direction from her. So puzzling and frustrating. So many missed opportunities.<br /><br />*Katniss never takes full control of her life. She never truly reflects on whats happened to her country or her personal journey. I wish the book was told from other characters' POV at times, because Katniss certainly wasn't up for the job. any information was a burden to her, and subsequently for the reader as well.<br /><br />*the way the book was written was distinctly different than the other two. More disjointed, rambling, confusing, distracted, rushed. I found myself skimming for the first time in the trilogy.<br /><br />*The horror never seemed tocease. beheadings, human torches, under sized limbs thrown about, on and on and on. Yes, war is atrocious. But this is a YA scifi book, and I felt like I was tricked into reading 1984 again. The killing is so gratuitous that the author doesn't even pause to check in with her characters so see how they might be reacting. I suppose this could be seen as a method demonstrating the mindlessness of war but that seems like the only statement this book series has come to. Thats all Suzanne wanted to tell me? I thought the series was about the work of amazing people bringing down a cruel empire, not war is bad.<br /><br />*THe first two books were so, so, good. I completely loved them. I feel so sad now that the whole last book was such a misery. I don't know if I can re-read the first two knowing what becomes of everything. This book wasn't meant to instill a sense of hope or triumph in the reader, it sought to depress them. I spent the whole next day re-writing it in my head.<br /><br />*everyone is broken. In that sense, I feel like they won the war but lost themselves. They weren't the resilient people that were so impressive in the other books. They were clever, resourceful, hopeful before. I know its because war ruins people's lives but they have given up and its so bleak.These characters didn't even care about each other anymore. Katniss didn't bother to try to help peeta. Katniss' world fell apart and no one tried to comfort her. Her mother, Haymitch, Gale, disintegrated. All the characters left alive became zombies. So I stopped caring. and that sucks because I cared so much before.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />I have to admit, I was a litte wary of this book at first. So many people said so many different things about it and I didn't know what to expect. So when I finally bought it and read through it I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The beginning of the book is amazing, with obvious love between Katniss and Prim. I love how their mother is a catatonic zombie half of the time, making her present, but not all there leaving Katniss to feed them all. I also admit to loving Gale at first, more on that later.<br /><br />When we actually get to the tributes and all that \\"fun\\" stuff, it's heartbreaking when Prim get's chosen and then Katniss volunteers. I remember thinking, 'oh no, tell me Gale isn't going to get picked too.' And he wasn't! Then I read more about Peeta and I was irritated because he was a cool guy.<br /><br />Then the actual Games started and the diologue pretty much stopped. I thought that would bother me because there was hardly any diologue. I was given the facts of what was happening and what Katniss was thinking and that was it. But it was a surprisingly enjoyable part of the novel.<br /><br />I grew to love the characters and nearly cried a few times like the big baby I am. Then they announced that if two tributes from the same district survive to the end, they will both win, I was thrilled! I could see Katniss and Peeta actually falling in love with each other, even if Katniss didn't realize it, and it was enjoyable.<br /><br />Blah blah blah, skip all the next stuff because you probably don't care at this minute. Then we get all the way to the end and Katniss crushes Peeta and I wanted to reach into my kindle and strangle her to death. Of course it was all Gale's fault that she crushed Peeta because she realized that she MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE FEELINGS FOR THE SHMUCK! I was so irritated, but in a good way. Now I just really want to read the next book and find out what happens.

B00127RAJY|4.0|In January 2012, I started a journey that has lead me thus far to loosing 38 pounds. My wife and I started doing this DVD together daily for exercise and we both really enjoyed it. Unfortunately she hurt her foot doing something unrelated and we had to stop for a while, but we're looking forward to starting back up again together. My four year old daughter has even enjoyed exercising with us a time or two with this video.<br /><br />The routines are challenging, but doable and do not require a lot of equipment. We use a mat and dumbells. You build form and endurance and you continue through the program. Together with a sensable diet, this video has helpd make a difference for us.<br /><br />I think I will also pick up the Jillian Michaels Kickbox FastFix video for more variety.

B00004Y6NU|5.0|Dire Straits  \\"Love Over Gold\\"  #19  (1982).<br /><br />On Dire Straits' 4th studio album \\"Love Over Gold\\", they added keyboardist Alan Clarke and rhythm guitarist Hal Lindes.  On this album they expanded their sound even more, with the shortest song lasting 5:50.  We get the 14 1/2 minute \\"Telegraph Road\\", this is a great atmospheric song, with a great solo by Mark.  \\"Private Investigations\\", is the mellowest song on the album, \\"Industrial Disease\\", is a fun quirky song, hitting #9 MSR and #75 hot 100.  \\"The title track, is a sharp tune, one of Mark's best solo's, and the album closes with \\"It Never Rains\\", great song, with a terrific riff.  Dire Straits did an EP in early '83 \\"Twisting By The Pool\\", #53 which hasn't been released up to 2012. (Should be about time).  This album had the classic title cut #12 MSR, \\"Badges,Posters,Stickers,T-Shirts\\", with kind of a cool-jazz feel to it.  \\"Two Young Lovers\\", a very nice dance number with a jumpy sax and \\"If I Had You\\", a solid 50's style rocker, fun times.  They would release their first live album \\"Alchemy\\", in early 1984.
0307719219|4.0|I am not an economist nor I have passed the first chapter chapter of the book , but I have seen BIG data errors. They are too big to be called manipulated, errors that helps promote their theory. The authors make the comparisons between Nogales, Sonora, Mexico and Nogales, Arizona, USA; and here is where they get in trouble very fast:<br /><br />1-\\"the average citizen of the United States is 7 times more prosperous that the average Mexican\\". This is far from true, not to say a lie. Per capita (PPP) income in Mexico (aka average Mexican) is: $15,100 (2011 est.) according to the CIA World Fact Book. Per capita (PPP) income in the USA (aka average \\"American\\") is: $48,100 (2011 est.) according to the same CIA World Fact Book. THAT IS 3.2 TIMES MORE, NOT 7. There are countries like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates that are far from democratic which have a higher PPP than that of the USA. [...]<br /><br />2-\\"Mexican average annual household income is around $5,000\\", WRONG AGAIN. The average income of a Mexican family of four is $60,400 ($15,100 x 4). In the same manner an average income of a family of four in the US $192,400 ($48,100 x 4). If you have a family of four and make less, now you know that you may be above the median, but certainly you are below average. That is 95% of the population of the USA is below average. There is a BIG difference between the average and the median household income. We learn that in high school.<br />Furthermore, the median worker in Mexico may be paid $5,000 a year, but on top of that his employee pays $2,500 for Social Security which is very similar to the American version, but also includes childcare and health insurance for all the household (no 25 year old limit, it includes all children, parents or grandparents that may qualify dependents).<br /><br />3-Life Expectancy. The authors state that life expectancy in Nogales USA is much higher that of the Nogales Mexico. The authors provide no data, why? According to the CIA World FactBook, Life Expectancy in the USA is 78.49 years and in Mexico 76.66 (1.83 years less); not such a big difference. In some countries poorer than the USA life expectancy is higher: Puerto Rico 79.07, Greece 80.05, Spain 81.27, and Canada 81.48 (2.99 years more than the USA). That is the USA is closer to Mexico than to Canada regarding healthcare.<br /><br />[...]
B00004Y6NV|3.0|Dire Straits  \\"On Ever Street\\"  #12  (1991).<br /><br />Dire Straits' 6th and final studio offering \\"On Every Street\\", would come out 6 years after the mega selling \\"Brothers In Arms\\".  I guess 6 years was too long a wait, because the fan base disappeared by this time, (it sold 1 million copies).  The songs weren't as sharp as they were in the 70's and 80's.  Here are the keepers from my point of view,  \\"Heavy Fuel\\" #1 MSR, \\"The Bug\\", #8 MSR, which was covered by Mary Chapin Carpenter on her 1992 album \\"Come On Come On\\".  And the fairly successful single \\"Calling Elvis\\" #3 MSR, the rest of the album just falls into a country-middle of the road pap.  Guy Fletcher filled in on keyboards and Vince Gill guested on the album.  Nice little career 1978-1991.

B00004Y6NX|5.0|Dire Straits \\"Making Movies\\"  #19  (1980).<br /><br />Dire Straits' 3rd album \\"Making Movies\\", is quite a change from their first two releases, on \\"Movies\\", the sound changed from pub-rock to more of a E-Street Band sound.  Roy Bittan did feel in on keyboards on this set and Jimmy Iovine produced.  The keyboards fleshed out the sound, that just made listening to the band much more enjoyable.  When the needle comes down on the great 8 minute opening track \\"Tunnel Of Love\\", (one of my favorites from the band), you can tell this is going to be a different sounding Dire Straits.  Mark Knopfler's guitar is spectacular throughout.  \\"Romeo And Juliet\\", a very emotional driven song, \\"Skateaway\\", #31 MSR, #58 hot 100, 6 1/2 minutes of greatness.  \\"Expresso Love\\". #39 MSR, just smokes, a track that should be on any classic rock mix tape.  \\"Hand In Hand\\", is a solid pop-rocker, \\"Solid Rock\\". #9 MSR, reminds me a little bit of Bob Dylan in this time period.  \\"Les Boys\\", french, just not the best track, but very listenable.  Great album from 1980.  Two years later they would release \\"Love Over Gold\\".

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Did I enjoy this book: Yes, I loved it the first time I read it. And after this second reading, I still love it every bit as much. The action in this book is fast paced and keeps you glued to the book from the very beginning.  I can honestly say that I read this book every free chance I had both times I have read it. Even the second time around, I found it hard to put this book down to take care of the every day stuff that needed to be done. I just couldn't wait to see what happened next!<br /><br />This was the first dystopian YA book I had ever read. What a way to break into a genre!! This book was exciting, emotional, enraging, and enthralling! (I can't believe I described this book with all 'e' words.) It's hard to imagine a world like this, but this book is written so well that I can imagine a world like this - as sad as that is. Ms. Collins is an amazing writer. The world she built can be pictured clearly. I can see the absurdity of the Capitol and its citizens - what it looks like, how they dress, what they eat. I can see the despair of the districts - the poverty, the hurt, the defeat.<br /><br />Katniss is a great heroine. She isn't perfect...far from it, in fact. But she is strong, she is a provider, she is a survivor. I like her no nonsense approach to her life and her lot. She does what she needs to do in order to protect those who love her. She is funny, too. Ms. Collins writes some funny dialogue and thoughts. One of my favorite thoughts of Katniss is from Chapter 2: \\"Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I\\"m trying to slit his throat.\\"<br /><br />Haymitch is fantastic. He is just like Katniss...or should I say that Katniss is just like him? They are great together and truly seem to get one another. His messages to Katniss in the arena are clear and understood by Katniss.<br /><br />Peeta and Gale both love Katniss. Only one can have her. I have a favorite. I'm not going to say who it is because if you haven't read this book, I don't want to give anything away! However, if you haven't read this book yet...WHY NOT??? Seriously, go get it immediately and read it!<br /><br />Would I recommend it: Absolutely!!!<br /><br />Will I read it again: Yes, I will. Probably once a year...especially right before the release of the movie sequels.<br /><br />[...]I don't want to give anything away! However, if you haven't read this book yet...WHY NOT???

B0072OFM28|2.0|Aside from the new Spartacus, who's acting is not that good, and his all too innocent, pathetic looking eyes, which are not suited to his role, his eyes lack the passion and determination that the tragic Whitfield had. The storyline was slow, dull, and not worthy of a second season.<br /><br />I loved the prequel and the first season, great storylines and intriguing characters.  The characters in season two are quite simply dull.<br /><br />Lucy Lawless does an astonishing job, her talent was the only thing that kept me watching, and sadly is the only redeeming quality in a series that was once so eye-openingly brilliant.<br /><br />I rated this as a 2 stars only because I enjoy Imperial Roman genres and for the quality of Lucy Lawless's performances.
1451629184|5.0|I wanted to buy this book to help Jaycee's cause - and stop this insanity now.  I wish I could buy 1,000,000.  It has been one of the most difficult and painful books I've read in my lifetime.  The horrors that this girl experienced are unfathomable and how brave she is to step up to the plate and confront her captors/torturers.  The number one thing I took from this book is that we all need to be aware of our environment and pay attention to relationships that don't seem right.  Investigate - question.  Social workers, parole officers, therapists, neighbors - be on alert always!!!  Especially with repeat sex offenders.  And we need to somehow teach our children that if taken they must do what it takes to get away.  I applaud you Jaycee and wish I could meet you and give you a huge hug one day.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|This is the first movie to make me laugh so hard I had to stop it to breath.<br />Even when reiterating the movie to a friend I had to pause three of four time to stop laughing/catch my breath.<br />As good as Hot Fuzz ,and Shaun of the dead.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Granted, there is nowhere to go but up when dealing with stock keyboards.  I have tried several more popular keyboards and have found that I like SwiftKey X the best.  Setup is a little convoluted, with some aspects leaving me wondering why it couldn't default to certain options (the instructions are in American English - defaulting to that language rather than making me choose from a list would make sense).  No gripes besides that.  SwiftKey X has been successful in weaning me off physical keyboards.  Good stuff.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|A wonderful book, and a must read for teens and for adults who have teens in their lives.  It shows very well how even the littlest, seemingly innocuous events can be catastrophic for young people.  It also demonstrates the requirement for parents, teachers, and friends to think about their actions, and the actions of those around them, and truly look at things from someone else's perspective.  Moreover - to take action and not sit idly by when you see someone in need of a helping hand, or simply a kind \\"hello.\\"
B005ETA5K2|5.0|i use wifi in motels a lot during travel assignments. connecting to the wifi signal is never a problem but the signal strength is always a problem. this product works beyond all my expectations. i went from trying to load web pages one per hour to being able to watch video. can't thank the these guys enough for such an excellent product.  how often can anyone say a product exceeds expectations nowadays? i highly recommend.
B000TEMROY|5.0|Before I bought this, the only songs that I had really heard from the album were Bittersweet Symphony and Lucky Man- both of which I always liked. When I saw that the album was discounted, I snapped it up to hear the rest.<br /><br />This is such an amazing album. Almost every song is awesome. It really seems like a \\"Greatest Hits\\" kind of collection, even though it was just a great album. I cannot recommend it enough, especially if you've only heard Bittersweet Symphony when all the radio stations played it out.
0439023521|4.0|I've been meaning to read this book for months because my sister really enjoyed them.  I'd been hesitating because, well, I don't normally like contemporary fiction. I usually find it poorly written and not nearly as engaging as the classics.  That's whey they're called \\"classics\\". Anyway, I really enjoyed the plot of this book.  The story was compelling enough to keep me reading, even though it was a bit predictable at times.  Did anyone actually think that either Katniss or Peeta would die?  Nope.<br /><br />I thought Katniss was a pretty well fleshed-out character.  I understood her thinking and her motivations.  She was interesting.<br /><br />Now onto the Gale V. Peeta debate:  In this first book, we don't get to spend much time with Gale, but he's definitely more interesting to me than Peeta.  Gale seems much more of a real character than Peeta.  He makes sense to me, and his relationship with Katniss feels natural and comfortable.  Peeta, on the other hand, seems too over the top mushy gushy.  I don't believe that he loves Katniss.  His back story and puppy love for her seem forced, and unfortunately that's all there is to him so far.  The writer just didn't convince me.  Of course, his relationship with Katniss feels forced partly because it is forced.  She plays it up to help them survive the Games.<br /><br />I am wondering, though, what the author will do for two more books?  Will the characters begin to fight against the Capitol?  Probably.
0393316041|5.0|This book is absolutely Fabulous. Mr. Feynman is either a liar (which he's not), or he has led one of the most interesting lives of any American I know. His stories hit a special cord with me because his story telling reminds me of my Grandfather, Pap Bud. He worked with the greatest scientists in human history and, in the end, became one. It leaves you totally inspired.

006197806X|5.0|Reading Pandemonium not long after Delirium, there was quite a bit about the first book still fresh in my mind.  That helped a good deal while reading Pandemonium because I truly remembered and understood just why Lena had taken so many risks to get away from Portland, and I knew why she was so depressed initially. I also understood why Lena fought so hard against any feelings she might develop for Julian; the specter of Alex was still too fresh. But in many ways, Pandemonium is a fuller, richer tale; Lena not only discovers her will to live, but her determination to fight, be it for the Resistance or for those she loves.<br /><br />As with Delirium, Pandemonium starts a bit slowly, moving back and forth between timelines that show what happened to Lena immediately after her escape into the Wilds and approximately six months later, when she has become an active member of the Resistance. Lena's way into rebellion starts slowly, and she quickly learns that life in the Wilds is harsh, with starvation and raids constantly looming. And while I can understand Lena's reliance on the leader Raven, I never warmed up to her personality. Even so, I supported Lena's decision to \\"rejoin\\" the society she'd grown up in and try to get to Julian, the son of the leader of the DFA. When things begin to go seriously wrong, it was fairly easy to see how Lena could grow closer to the boy she seemed to despise; I loved their trek through the underground tunnels and the people they encountered along the way. But the sense of betrayal Lena feels is overwhelming as the climax of the story looms, and even the ultimate action still didn't redeem Raven fully to this reader. And that ending? Wow...even if you see it coming, it's still an electric moment, one that makes your jaw drop. This series is well written and involving, delivering action and emotion in equal amounts. If there are issues with the predictability, those can be forgiven for the way Lena's story is being woven out of equal parts of Then and Now. Good fun!s of Then and Now. Good fun!
B002LVUKIS|5.0|I love the Thief series, at least the first two.  The atmosphere, graphics, gameplay (you seldom get bored playing this game) and virtual world are top notch.  I have been playing the series over and over again since the first one came out - for me they never get old.<br /><br />Eidos dropped the ball a bit on Thief 3 (which was the only one NOT done by Looking Glass studios, who sadly closed their doors after Thief 2) and while it still features Garret and his pseudo-medieval world, the gameplay is just ok.<br /><br />The best part is on this DVD, these games have been updated by Eidos to work on Win XP (if you try to play thief 1 and 2 on XP and it will install and the game will start and won't play and crash, or will play for a while then freeze -  disable your computer's hyperthreading in the BIOS, this often fixes the problem).<br /><br />My recommendation - buy this collection DVD NOW before it is gone for good.  They don't make games like this no more, folks.
0525478817|4.0|John Green is a favorite author of mine and yet I was reluctant to pick this one up, simply because of its subject matter. I am NOT a reader of cancer tales, and in particular cancer tales involving children. And yet this one kept calling to me; when my daughter read it and loved it, I knew it was time, assuring myself that with Green, cancer would be a backstory to the main one.<br /><br />Warning:  It's a cancer book.<br /><br />Other than that minor (not) detail, it's beautiful, full of truth about human relationships and life. Hazel is sixteen and has terminal cancer which has been held at bay for three years, but stealing her lungs' capacity to their work (\\"crap lungs\\").  Forced by her parents to attend a support group, she meets the handsome, witty Augustus, who becomes infatuated with her almost immediately. And though Hazel wishes to minimize the destruction of her impending, someday death by not becoming a \\"grenade\\", she finds herself falling in love with the dashing Gus, himself a survivor of bone cancer. Together, the two use his Wish to track down the author of their favorite novel, demanding answers to its unanswered questions (A Metaphor For Life? Certainly). Along the way, medical crises ensue and lessons about the fragility of life abound. And Green does all this with his usual funny, endearing, charming flair, making us sob buckets and forcing his characters into our hearts whether we want them there or not.<br /><br />While I adored the characters, I did feel the necessity of involving cancer in their lives was manipulative and unnecessary, though very realistic. Green did his research; he knew  the ins and outs of how medical teams work and what can go wrong. It's a story worth reading and definitely one that involves the reader fully. I do wish Green would move on from the road trip drama, but he's still one of  the best young adult writers out there today, my personal feelings about cancer story lines aside. He can make you laugh and cry and realize things you already knew. Beautifully written and recommended.lize things you already knew. Beautifully written and recommended.

0345803485|1.0|The story has a good premise when it started but soon became redundant.  It reminded me of how many would be serial killers started their careers. \\"Oh My\\".  The hero, Christian, is self centered, egotistical and needs some serious mental health counseling. This man would have been on multiple agency lists for being mentally unbalanced and potentially dangerous.  The next \\"green river\\" killer. Folks, this is the story of many a serial killer and how they start out. It's sad to me that women see this as normal and desirable. Good sex is when you love someone so much you become as one.  If you like an abusive, twisted relationship then this is for you.  I hope impressionable young people don't get their hands on this.  This is not a healthy relationship and not representative of  \\"good sex\\" in my opinion.  I can't imagine a more hideous dysfunctional relationship.  I have never given less than 4 stars on a review but this book takes abusive relationships to a new height.

B00004TR2G|5.0|When John Williams wrote the score for Steven Spielberg's chilling film about a great white shark terrorizing a New England resort, he could not have done a better job than the ominous, 2-tone cello/bass theme that made viewers aware of what waited below the water's surface, even when it couldn't be seen. While Williams would outdo himself in composing such soundtrack masterpieces as the original 'Star Wars' trilogy, the 'Indiana Jones' trilogy, and 'Superman: The Movie', he nonetheless created a score here that is STILL remembered as one of the finest in cinematic history. The score was one major component that earned 'Jaws' such accolades at the time of its release.<br /><br />For the record, this is the full deal here: all the tracks originally written for 'Jaws' are presented here, and in chronological order, something a lot of movie soundtrack buffs appreciate. The 'Main Title' presented here is the true original one from the film, unlike the original release which used the orchestral/theme version of it. A second track, called 'Chrissie's Death' on the original release, was merged with the main title for this recording which I think improves the continuity. 'The Pier Incident', in which 2 men, using a man's wife's holiday roast as bait, draw the shark into shore, uses mostly strings to portray the action in the film, changing in pitch from a higher violin to the low cello/bass for depicting the shark as it closes in on one of the men after ripping out the pier. The cello/bass theme tapers off as the man makes it to shore and the pier washes up next to him. 'Shark Attack', a previously unreleased (and unused) cue was a fantastic piece of work, using both brass & strings to depict the shark's motif. This track is actually heard in the 'Jaws Unleashed' video game and its advertising. 'Into the Estuary', also previously unreleased, uses strings quite heavily to build a panic as Brody runs toward the estuary after a woman spots the shark & starts calling; the tone changes to a darker, lower one as Brody is seen running along the shore followed by a mob of people, then slows abruptly as the shark knocks over a rowboat, turning the occupant into the water and then attacking him. A chilling string & harp motif appears, cutting then to a French Horn cue as the shark first makes a threatening pass at Mike Brody and then heads back out into the open sea, its telltale fin visible to the people on the beach. 'Blown to Bits' details the shark's demise at the hands of Brody, using a string/harp motif as the shark's body descends into the depths after Brody blows it up with a compressed air tank. The original end titles are also included here - I seem to remember they were omitted or edited on the original release.<br /><br />This was LONG overdue for a complete release; probably due to the restrictions of vinyl, a restriction no longer applicable; in addition to the decreased soundtrack market which led to limited release of soundtrack music (if they were released at all), kept this from being released until now. Bravo for releasing this great score in its entirety!changes to a darker, lower one as Brody is seen running along the shore followed by a mob of people, then slows abruptly as the shark knocks over a rowboat, turning the occupant into the water and then attacking him.

B005M2A4D4|5.0|I now have some new favorite episodes!!!<br /><br />Doctor Who has been a great show to me for more years than I feel comfortable telling here. This past year had me riveted. It has become a 'must discuss with coworkers at lunch' sort of show.  As for this DVD it has the extras that Who fans have come to expect.  The short sketch shows surprisingly enhance the story line and I don't think you can get them anywhere else. In my mind at least there is as good as any bit of acting done by any of the Regenerations in those few minutes of extra stuff. Why didn't they air them over here in the States or did I just miss them somehow.<br />yes, if you bought The Christmas special you will have a spare one now. Is that really a bad thing.<br /><br />Glad I waited for the Full season.<br /><br />I had mixed feelings about the split season when watching it on it's BBC America air date.  Having it all together and able to watch at will ironed out the somewhat bumpy and convoluted season spanning story arc. Not that it was a bad story line, I just feel some of the individual episodes were better than the whole season plot. And for a Show that does great cliffhangers between 2 part episodes, the first half cliffhanger just wasn't. Sure there were loose story ends to wrap up, and I was chomping at the bit for the second half to air, but the first show left me with greater desire for answers than \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\". Great episode but it answered large plot lines instead of keeping the carrot dangling out of reach.<br /><br />Highly Recommended

1567184855|5.0|I lost my parents while working in Iraq.  My ex-husband ordered this book for me.  When it arrived I was reading another.  He asked if I would mind waiting the year until we returned home on leave to be a blind scientific case study on the book.  I shrugged and said \\"OK\\".<br /><br />The following year he googled a local regressionist who also was a licensed clinical medical therapist who was certified by Dr. Newton's school.  I had two sessions.  At the first session she was able to relax me to the point that I knew she was good at something.... This in and of itself was amazing to me since I was suffering from insomnia.<br /><br />At the second session, she was able to present two questions that were derived from thousands of testimonials in the book.  My experience was EXACTLY as these some 10,000 clients of Dr. Newton's.  I was able to see my soul.  I can explain it in vivid detail as though I saw it yesterday.  And yes, it's very recognizeable by description.<br /><br />My ex-husband, a very non-spiritual man, was so compelled by this evidence that even he can't deny it.  He touts this book to anyone who will listen.<br /><br />Has it helped me with my grief?  Yes.  Has it helped me with my faith?  Yes.  Please don't just take my word for it.  If you'd like to perform your own blind study, ask a friend who doesn't mind reading a little to come up with some test questions for you.
B00755646W|4.0|The film:  This is the original theatrical cut that has been issued before on VHS and standard-DVD.  It does not include any extra performances such as the full-length \\"Like A Prayer,\\" or \\"Hanky Panky,\\" included in other releases.  The film itself is a good encapsulation of Madonna's \\"Blond Ambition Tour,\\" as well as what life was moderately like for her on the road.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:  The Blu-Ray quality is good.  The B&W scenes have the original grain intact and it was the director's intention to have that to show how grainy the real world is as opposed to the almost-grainless color performance segments.  The DTS 5.1 Sound is good but I really do not prefer 5.1 for music as I'd rather have an extended-stereo mix for music to have a richer sound.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a Madonna fan you will buy this considering it is less than $10.  If you do not have a copy of this movie, check to see if the other releases that include more special features are available first, and if not, buy this.<br /><br />CAUTION:  For some reason, this Blu-Ray has six (6!) previews that you have to watch before the movie starts; but, press your chapter advance button and you can go through them quicker.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) Original theatrical version<br />2) Great transfer preserving director's vision<br />3) No dynamic noise reduction making everything look too perfect<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) Sound is 5.1 DTS; I prefer Dolby Pro-Logic for music<br />2) No special features contained in prior releases<br />3) The trailer issue described above<br /><br />Strike a pose and Enjoy!

What a great idea!!  I love disney and since she is having a little girl, this book did both!  It created bedtime stories for her to read to her baby using Disney (my favorite).  When I received the book, I read through it and it was your typical stories, big bad wolf in red riding hood, the gingerbread man, etc however, with the disney princess in it.  I loved it!!  I hope that I can introduce my newest niece to my love for Disney with this book.  I would recommend it!!
B007NCSQFO|4.0|Nicki Minaj is many things, and so is this album. It features a handful of the artist's recent singles and many male collaborators. And although the album begins and ends with self-serving, punchy tracks, it also flows through a series of more introspective songs.<br /><br />The first few tracks are catchy, but simply self-congratulatory. \\"Roman Holiday\\" feels a bit like Gary Numan recorded an album at a Mayan temple. It combines lyrics from \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\" with a nearly helium-driven performance of Minaj's alter ego, Roman Zolanski. It goes even further into the ether than \\"Pink Friday\\"'s \\"Roman's Revenge.\\"If Minaj doesn't on other tracks, she indulges in \\"Come On A Cone,\\" referring to her appearance on \\"Ellen\\" and taunting by means of fellatio. That method of taunting continues in \\"I Am Your Leader,\\" which besides driving an especially sporty hook reminiscent of \\"Mario Tennis\\" also features Rick Ross doing what he does best -- sounding tough like his convicted, drug dealing namesake.<br /><br />With a hook that sounds like a dripping faucet in the Warehouse level of \\"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater,\\" \\"Beez in the Trap\\" is a fairly straightforward brag. It feels much like the locations it names. It excludes Manhattan from its list of New York City boroughs, and rhymes Hulk Hogan with Hoboken. The wrestler and city have always shared a certain grungy, trailer park feel.<br />Minaj seems to be gunning for rap's top dog, Jay-Z, in \\"HOV Lane.\\" Jay-Z, thoroughly blasphemous, refers to himself as H.O.V.A., a shortening of Jehovah. Appropriately, this song feels like Nicki's claim to Jay-Z's path. She makes clear, as she so often does, that \\"all these bitches is my sons\\" and references her appearances at the Super Bowl and Grammys while explicitly rejecting her image as a porn star.<br /><br />\\"Roman Reloaded\\" was released as a single months before this album, and despite its monotonous whine it's a solid track. My favorite part is Lil Wayne's verse. He seems particularlyproud of himself for this line: \\"Excuse my French, two bitches and moi / That's a Nicki Ménage à Trois,\\" punctuating it with a \\"Ha, told you,\\" as if he finally completed his goal of punning Nicki's name.<br />\\"Champion\\" is a chiller, more subtly triumphant track that features heavyweight rapper Nas as well as Drake. (Incidentally, Nicki's performance on Drake's \\"Make Me Proud,\\" goes far in combating the patriarchy of that song's lyrics and makes for a smooth listen.) The slower bass beat and lounging synth of \\"Champion\\" do not, however, compensate for the dime-a-dozen, rags-to-riches chorus: \\"It's a celebration / Pit it up for the ghetto / It's times like these / They know who we are by now / They know who we are / Champion, a champion.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sex in the Lounge\\" uniquely challenges gender roles. Whereas Minaj used \\"Super Bass\\" to describe her ideal man, Bobby V and Lil Wayne dominate this song with their claims to sexual  superiority. At first glance Nicki, rap's strongest woman, submits to the masculinity of the genre in \\"Sex in the Lounge.\\" But it's important to keep in mind how Nicki appraises men in her first verse: \\"Though he packin' that muscle, I'm addicted to brain.\\" This line not only nuances her preference for well-dressed coke dealers outlined in \\"Super Bass,\\" but also gives hope to all those nerdy white guys who would trade their life savings for a night with the rapper.<br /><br />\\"Starships,\\" like \\"Roman Reloaded\\" was previously released as a single. You've probably already heard it played to death on the radio already, and for good reason. The song combines Nicki's edgy pout with a Katy Perry-esque chorus and techno musical interludes. This is a great song to crank while driving down PCH on a cool summer day.<br />\\"Pound the Alarm\\" is a straightforward dance song, incorporating now thoroughly mainstream dubstep elements, wherein Nicki once again asserts her reputation as \\"a bad bitch\\" capable of holding her liquor and dominating the dance floor.<br /><br />\\"Whip It,\\" far from a Willow Smith cover, feels like a Vengaboys track played in a Parisian night club. Sadly, \\"Automatic\\" realizes its title and sounds much the same.<br />Despite its promisingly complex title, \\"Beautiful Sinner\\" is little more than a sexy dance song that feels more like Jennifer Lopez's \\"On the Floor\\" than the \\"Mirror\\" of Lil Wayne and Bruno Mars it could've been. Nicki does provide us with a strikingly reflective track, though, in \\"Marilyn Monroe.\\" Through comparison with Hollywood's favorite starling, Minaj expresses her own range of emotions: \\"Call me cursed / Or just call me blessed / If you can't handle my worst /You ain't getting my best / Is this how Marilyn Monroe feels? ... / Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt.\\"<br /><br />\\"Young Forever\\" is another commendably thoughtful track that combines the simplicity of a Gameboy Pocket beat and clapping with a memorable narrative of a first love lost. Nicki speaks for us all: \\"I'ma shed a tear, but I really don't care.\\" Minaj follows up these lyrics with the morosely vengeful \\"Fire Burns\\" where the singer wishes justice be done to her lover: \\"I hope you lay down in your sleep / And you choke on every lie you told / And when you're reaching out for me / You'll see you reap everything you sew.\\"<br /><br />Minaj closes her album with another single, \\"Stupid Hoe.\\" You must see the music video on YouTube to understand the number of female artists Minaj is insulting. Critics and fans have much maligned the track, but it has grown to be one of my favorites. Minaj makes it clear what she thinks of those who would speak ill of her trolling: \\"You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses.\\"<br />Overall, this album overcomes the fate of most sophomore albums by throwing out so many tracks that many are bound to become hits. But ultimately, \\"Pink Friday ... Roman Reloaded\\" suffers from the same problem as \\"Pink Friday.\\" These albums are not thematically cohesive, but acoustically similar collections of singles punctuated by blocks of more lyrically complex tracks with disappointingly plain beats. Nevertheless, Nicki's production has much improved on this album, and her flow and range continue to mature. Most fans will still prefer her performances in \\"Super Bass\\" and Kanye West's \\"Monster\\" to \\"Stupid Hoe.\\"
B007MC868M|4.0|Harry Hole returns in Jo Nesbo's latest North American release - Phantom. If this is a new to you series, I wouldn't recommend starting with Phantom. To truly appreciate Harry, you need to hop on at the beginning of the series - and get ready for a heck of a ride. If you've been following this series, then it's one you definitely don't want to miss.<br /><br />Harry Hole is one of the most tortured, conflicted, complicated protagonists in crime fiction. He's been away from Norway for the last three years in an attempt to clean himself up and step away from his relationship with Rakel. But what brings him back is murder, of course. Rakel's son Oleg has been charged with the murder of Gusto, a known drugs pusher. The evidence is damning, but Harry knows that the gentle little boy he watched grow could not be guilty of such a crime. Harry approaches his old department, but they have no interest in either reopening the case or having Harry back on board. So, Harry being Harry, he decides to investigate on his own. His inquiries catch the eye of the drug trade, in particular the mysterious Dubai, who runs an insidious new product called Violin. Corrupt individuals on the police force and in the political theatre aren't happy with Harry's investigation either. Harry is creating problems and needs to be eliminated. It's just a matter of who gets him first.......<br /><br />\\" You can't stop this Harry. It's all happened. It has to run its course. If you get in the way, more will die....It's too big, Harry.

B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I bought this cover 4 months ago.  It was very nice at first.  It still somewhat durable.  But now the cover part is very floppy.  It doesn't always hold the kindle so I can watch videos or read a recipe while cooking.  All in all it was nice but it didn't last long at all.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending felt rushed.  I wanted to know more about how they grew back together and how Peeta overcame the brainwashing. I guess for her to write more about that would've made it the fairy tale ending a lot of people seem to want. And I don't understand why people are whining about how dark and horrible the subject matter is or that Katniss should have been written as a strong female instead of a weak one.  The latter complaint infuriates me the most.  The girl has been through hell and back and you all think she could've handled it better? Get off your high horse! I also don't understand people feeling drained and depressed after reading it. I was depressed that it was over!  I loved this book. I loved all three but this one I did not put down and read it in one day. It is fiction, it is not real. If you can remember that and you can allow yourself to get lost in fantasy then you should have no problem loving this book.
B007PPE086|5.0|I must admit I was excited to see a black and white doll that even someone like myself could procure. I mean, I don't like competing for limited editions.<br /><br />The doll is in greyscale like the 2010 Comic Con Frankie Stein. However, she's dressed in a swimsuit, coverup and shoes with a hexagonal bangle on her wrist.<br /><br />I got her for 20 dollars. Cheapest price I found online so far.<br /><br />I like the attention to detail and she is a welcome addition to my collection.
B0076UXKDG|3.0|Nikon deserves to sell very few of these and indeed a lot of us will skip it or wait for aftermarket. This is a fine grip, just like previous models. It offers absolutely nothing new yet costs FAR more (twice the price!) of the D700 grip. 3rd party companies will have a BIG business building a better grip for less money. This accessory is a real shame in light of the very fairly price D800.<br />Like the MB10 the grip feels sturdy and all controls work well. The battery compartment comes with a tray for AA batteries and another for Nikon's battery. This will also get you the 6 FPS in DX mode. But the price is insulting. There's just no other way to look at it.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Books look better on the iPad and the Touchpad.  It seems like this app is designed for phones and not tablets.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ok, this is hands down the dorkiest book I have ever read. I was completely skeptical and found it hard to believe that it had received such high ratings from literally every site I get recommendations from. I was almost instantly proven wrong when I began reading Ready Player One. This immediately became one of those books that I get totally sucked into. Cline did a wonderful job of turning this typically non-interesting topic (to me at least) into one of the most exciting novels I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Ready Player One was extremely fast paced and packed a ton of action in without feeling overwhelming. The main characters were not your typical heros/heroines, which made me like them that much more. It was a total underdog story and I loved every minute of it!
B000002LIR|4.0|If you like Rod Stewart and cannot, or do not want to, purchase every album he has released since 1969 (or singles back to 1964), then this set is for you.  Of course, if you only like some of his stuff (which usually means you like a particular phase or style from his long career), then purchasing a few of his original albums probably won't set you back too much.  As far as representing his best stuff from 1964 through 1990, I don't think this can be beat.  I am not a big fan of his later stuff, having first been exposed to his brilliant Mercury albums when I was in grade school, however, I do enjoy some of his later songs (meaning mostly his Warner material) and it's nice to have them all on one source.  As to the sound quality, I suppose some will complain that it's not remastered as are some other comps, or some of the original albums.  That is true.  However, with the exception of a few 60's selections on the first CD, the sound is surprsingly good for a CD set that was mastered long ago. The audiophiles will have you beleive the sound is a turnoff.  It is not.  At least for most ears.  I geuss if you have the money to buy a good chunk of his remastered original albums, a remastered Faces (his old band) set, and a couple of remastered greatest hits packages, you could almost reproduce this set with slightly better sound quality at a higher decibel level.  For me, not worth the trouble.  Had this set for 10 years and it still provides a lot of enjoyment.
0345803485|5.0|These books literally had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I could not put it down and spent many sleepless nights just to read one more page, one more chapter...it was really captivating. To be honest, when I read all the reviews I went into it really skeptical and did compare it to a more raunchy version of Twilight, but as the story continued, it was NOTHING like it.  Yes its graphic with the sex scenes, but that's what makes it so intriguing.  I have never read an erotica novel before, and it did make me uncomfortable in the beginning, but the beautiful love story  captured me.  I am SO sad its over, I definitely plan to reread all the books.  Two thumbs up, everyone should read it.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|When trying to play a video it asks you to select a program to complete this action.  when showing pictures it appears to be using the built-in picture viewer, so I wonder if it actually plays the music or if it just feeds your selected audio files to the built-in player.  This should be called a media user interface not a PLAYER.

B007MDB71O|4.0|So I can't review the actual quality of the Blu-Ray since it has yet to be released, but this was a fantastic and under-appreciated movie.  I've seen it three times in the theater.  Simply put, people who see it, love it.  Unfortunately more people haven't seen it due to bad buzz prior to the film's release.  Its based on the science fiction book series John Carter of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs (better known as being the creator of Tarzan).  The first book, Princess of Mars which is what this story is based on, was initially published 100 years ago!  If you are a fan of modern science fiction you owe it to yourself to check this movie out because it inspired all of it.  Star Wars, comic book heroes, and Avatar in particular--all of them were inspired by John Carter's adventures.  The acting is great and there is some solid action sequences to be found here as well.  I also really enjoyed the music, which comes from the composer behind Lost and 2009's Star Trek.  The special effects have to be seen to be believed.  When John Carter is interacting with the green aliens of Mars its seamless, you can't tell whats real and whats computer animated. Give it a try!  You will enjoy it, I can promise that.

B007LEC7CC|1.0|A sad little album.  \\"Beautiful Killer\\" is the only decent track--and only available on the delux version.  \\"Masterpiece\\" and the other ballad, whatever it was called, just remind me that she did much better ballads with Rain, You'll See, and Live to Tell.  For the other knock-offs, such as \\"I'm a Sinner\\", listen to the original, \\"Beautiful Stranger,\\" instead--at least in that one she doesn't force-rhyme the names of saints (which did give me a good laugh).  Much of the album, (feels like 99% and five hours worth), makes noise about her failed marriage.  Failed marriages always make for great happy dance music, don't they (!).  \\"Gang Bang\\", the best of these \\"I'm-having-a-catharsis\\" tracks, gets interesting after minute 4.<br /><br />Maybe the remixes won't be as sad.

1401929281|5.0|I am just finishing up this book and love it!  I now want to take the basic dna class with Vianna.  This is a comprehensive manual on a way to connect with our Creator and become a witness to healing in our lives and the lives of others!  Vianna's mastery of this topic is evident in her writing of this book as it has a textbook feel to it.  Not for those who want to just breeze through a book as this is solidly written with no fluff at all. When it comes to healing, I want to know that the person I am seeing and working with has really gone through some concrete and viable education on the process, and as I healer I want to be able to give my clients assurance that I take the practice seriously. In the book, she goes into personal stories and cases but keeps them small enough so that they don't take over the entire book.  I am tired of reading books that focus primarily personal expereince and give little teaching to the reader.  Vianna's style is opposite.  She gives you all the solid materials and supports it with just the right amount of personal accounts.  I am wanting to start my own healing practice and this book really has helped me with understanding how to heal, that I do have the power and the ethics of healing others as well.  I also recommend this book for those who have heard the terms: Source, downloads, clearing and dna activation because Vianna goes into that deeply and helps the reader understand what those experiences really are.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I will confess that I have never read any Stephen King book proir to this.  I like reading history, mystery thrillers and a bit of sci-fi.  So I went into this on a little unsure of what I was going to get.<br /><br />What I got was a ticket into a world that existed 20 years before I was born.  The insight to America of the late 50's early 60's was incredibly vivid and real. The path that Jake Epping traced through the past toward history was enthralling and addicting.  What made this book all the more real was Jake / George's relationship with Sadie.  George and Sadie actually made the book for me, it added a depth to the story that went well beyond JFK.<br /><br />I don't normally get so deep into a book where after it is over I find myself affected by what I read.  This book taught me a lot about they way things were in a bygone era but it also taught me something about myself and my relationships. (Sorry to sound so profound)<br /><br />Bravo Mr. King<br />This is probably the best thing I have ever read.

1451627289|5.0|I didn't know what to expect in 11/23/63 having never read much of King. I like complete novels, books that don't leave me hanging with implausibilities, overblown narration or loose threads everywhere. I realize after reading 11/23/63 why King is considered one of our greatest authors. I won't get into the plot of 11/23/63, you can read that for yourself on the description - which you probably already have. Instead let's talk about the writing: It is complete, it is beautiful, and it never leaves you hanging. The voice of the narrator of 11/23/63, Jake Epping, carries you through the story and you are not left asking why, or how, but rather carried along. It's a complete narrative. Everything is answered, everything is foreshadowed at just the right moment, and through King's brilliant prose you live in Jake Eppings shoes.<br /><br />This is NOT a political book. Yes, deep in the last 1/3 there is a little politics, more or less observations of a future, but it is not what you might think. I've grown up believing King to be - for lack of better terms - a liberal writer. Don't let this view, or any political view, of King get in your way though. There is no politics of any significance in 11/23/63. I think this is an important distinction to make because this is Kennedy we're talking about, and stopping his assassination. Instead King sticks solidly to the characters and the story and leaves politics to nothing more than casual observations that I doubt anyone of any stripe will take issue with.<br /><br />I give great credit to King for his research. This book is very, very well researched. It's both a history book and a beautiful work of historial fiction. King cites many authors on the subject of the assassination and Oswald, of all flavors, and I appreciated that. He didn't take it one way or another but kept it as accurate to history as you can with a story like this.<br /><br />If there's one drawback to 11/23/63 is that it is a typical King novel: long. It will take you sometime, but again, it's a beautifully written story that is neither complex or terse. You are literally carried gently through the story and the reader is never left hanging. Another small drawback is with the character of Al. I wish there had been more of him. I wish there was more to be learned from him. I think Al could have contributed much, much more to the story than King allowed, but again this is only a minor complaint.<br /><br />11/23/63 is one of the finest, most complete novels I have ever read.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Simply put.. I read all three books as fast as I could.. well within 3 or 4 days (but life and work kept getting in the way!!)  I am in the middle of book three and i know as soon as I finish, I will start re-reading the trilogy immediately thereafter.  People magazine even had a Poll about who should play Christian and who should play Ana.  I picture Christian Grey portrayed by Gabriel Aubry (Halle Berry's ex).......although I don't know if he is considered an actor.  I hope Ms. James continues with this duo, there are many possibilities for storylines.  Plleeeaaassse Ms. James???

B0054U53WG|2.0|I was really eager to read Steven Levy's \\"In the Plex\\" - how did I find it? Complex, certainly. Perplexing as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately I found Steven Levy's Google-boosterism suspect, and his prose not very \\"sticky,\\" to use digerati buzzword. I was particuarly disappointed with his obtuse description of the Adwords product (I think Nicholas Carr has a much more cogent explanation of Adwords in his book [[ASIN:0393339750 The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains]]).<br /><br />In the Plex could also have benefited from the addition of photographs and diagrams.<br /><br />I just didn't find \\"In the Plex\\" that exciting. It's one of the first, if not the first, books to document the early history of Google, but only time will tell if it will be the best. Perhaps we should consult a Haruspex!

B005LAIH2W|5.0|Beware!  Spoilers!  I read the 11 books in the \\"Barsoom\\" series back in the 60s and 70s, and really loved them.  I was so happy when I saw a trailer of this film, and had high hopes for its success.  I don't know why it seems that so many bloggers and critics were doing their best to make this film a failure, but as of today, I see that it has made back the $250 million it cost, and I'm pleased to say that I think they did a great job making it.  Here are some reasons why: 1. It's a visual delight.  Nothing looked fake.  The \\"red men\\" of Barsoom were ingeniously depicted as tattooed.  Woola was hideous, yet adorable.  The costumes were gorgeous...it would have been hard to stick to the book, there...everyone on Barsoom goes pretty much naked. The green men wear unique jewelry, etc. that helps the viewer to differentiate between them.  2. Any one who thinks this film was too complex hasn't read the books.  If you haven't you would not believe how much work they did to simplify the storyline.  And they did it without upsetting fans of the books by leaving out their favorite bits.  If you were expecting a mindless story that you could follow without paying close attention, too bad.  3. They updated the story for modern sensibilities.  A few things in the original 100-year-old story would be considered racist, now.  And Woola did like to mash the bad guys to jelly.  4. They gave Carter a good back-story.  The original one required an extra dose of suspension-of-disbelief.  Same goes for the means of getting to and from Barsoom.  They actually explained it!  I love it! (The Therns, in the books, did have a pretty advanced technology.)  5.  I got tears in my eyes, at the end, when he finally goes back to his beloved Dejah, after 10 years of exile. I'm afraid we won't get to see a sequel, thanks to Disney's horrible marketing of the film, but I'm so grateful for what they did produce, and can't wait to watch it a few more times.  Buy it, and join me.

0439023513|2.0|[SPOILERS]<br /><br />I enjoyed The Hunger Games tremendously.  Couldn't put it down.  However I found this book extremely disappointing.<br /><br />However, my disappointment was NOT with the lack of a \\"satisfactory\\" ending.  I found it refreshing that Collins did not give in to a trite warm and fuzzy resolution.  That would have been a cop-out.<br /><br />My disappointment is with Collin's characterization of the heroine and the heroine's story arc.  The stories (books, movies, whatever) I enjoy most and find most rewarding are those in which I can put myself in the place of the characters.  And even though I am not a 17 year old girl in a oppressed society, I can put myself in Katniss' place as I read.  But in the course of three books (and in particular in this book) virtually every decision Katniss makes is dismissed, overruled and reversed by a man.  And once by her sister.  She doesn't grow as a character.  Not one bit.  She is just as clueless, bitter, and self-conscious at the end of everything as she was at the beginning (more so, in fact).  Except at the beginning she had character, and at the end she just has angst.<br /><br />I understand that Collins wanted this to be a stark depiction of the realities of war, but even in war an individual can learn something, grow as a person, and develop some new skills.  Katniss doesn't do any of these things.  Even in the end when she assassinates Coin, that decision is tainted by Snow's manipulation and her need for personal revenge.  It could have been a triumph of her will over her circumstances and having made a hard decision based on that facts (that every reader has already figured out) and the future of her people.  But no.  She even fails at that.<br /><br />If the point of the book was that the heroine ultimately cares LESS about her loved ones and her community than she does for herself, then I suppose the book was a success.  But if that WAS the point, then I maintain that this was not a good book, or agood trilogy.  Certainly not a particularly enjoyable read.
B000002GQE|4.0|Days of Future Passed is a significant departure from the R&B style that defined the first Moody Blues album, 1965's The Magnificent Moodies. They reinvented their approach into a union of classical and rock music, resulting in a pioneering record of symphonic progressive rock that became their definitive sound.<br /><br />\\"Cold-hearted orb that rules the night,<br />Removes the colours from our sight.<br />Red is grey and yellow white,<br />But we decide which is right.<br />And which is an illusion\\"<br /><br />The album is conceptually centered around the sequential transition from morning to night, tracing the perceptive patterns of time from the bright states of awakening to the brooding reflections before drifting into sleep. Grand orchestral sections bridge the songs, which in turn are shaped by the moods of each thematic event. The structure of the album is elaborate but not complex; despite the expansive conceptual foundation and the rich instrumentation, they strive for and achieve a certain musical elegance that keeps the songs consistently engaging and lucid. In-between the overture of \\"Day Begins\\" and the album's theatrical finale, marked by Graeme Edge's dramatically recited poems, the band delivers an impressive collection of conceptually reflective songs, carefully arranged according to the emotional environment of each movement. When at their most joyful and lively, as in the animated rock 'n' roll of \\"Peak Hour\\" or the blissfully atmospheric melodies of \\"Forever Afternoon (Tuesday)\\", the enthusiasm never becomes naive or exaggerated, just as their most brooding moments never become universally morose. The driving mood rock of \\"The Sun Set (Twilight Time)\\" is their most effective portrayal of the harmonic synthesis between the two ends of the emotional spectrum, its contemplative tone provided a sense of forward momentum nicely setting the stage for \\"Nights in White Satin\\", the album's grand masterpiece of distant, passionate longing. Throughout thealbum, Mike Pinder's mellotron-produced melodic backdrops, the ephemeral flute melodies of Ray Thomas, and the band's penchant for invigorating multi-part vocal harmonies produce a consistently endearing and distinct effect, while countering the album's theatrical extravagance with fluid melodic constructions.<br /><br />\\"I can see it all<br />From this great height.<br />I can feel the sun<br />Slipping out of sight<br />And the world still goes on<br />Through the night.\\"<br /><br />The themes of childlike wonder and melancholic yearning, sometimes delivered in a lighthearted tone, are contextually grounded in spiritual exploration and cosmological enchantment, sonically manifested in the psychedelic atmospheres and daydreaming pop melodies. Day of Future Passed is an adventurous and inspired work, unique in the development of British symphonic rock of the time, demonstrating an exquisite combination of sounds in a vast thematic scope without overwhelming the genuine nature of their artistic perception.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow, the conclusion to this series seriously rocked everything down to its core, I think. Mockingjay, hands down, has to be the saddest out of the whole series. With Catching Fire ending on such a huge cliffhanger, this book picks up where it left off. With the help of Haymitch, Finnick and some of the other older victors, Katniss is thrust right into the actual heart of the rebels.<br /><br />It was awesome getting to see how the rebels have ingrained themselves so deep into the Capitol and its missions. I loved seeing Katniss take on such a huge role in becoming the Mockingjay. I admit I thought she was a bit too selfish in this book compared to others but I still had fun reading about what she got herself into and the people willing to risk their lives for her. Peeta wasn't in this one as much as he was in the previous two books and for that I was sad. But the scenes he was in had my heart breaking. I just love that boy so much. We do see a good amount of Gale, Finnich, Johanna, Plutarch and Beetee, though, which I really enjoyed because they are all very different people.<br /><br />Again, this one wasn't as suspenseful as the first book was (although the last quarter or so had me almost biting my nails) but I was just as fascinated with it as I was the previous two. I loved seeing everything work itself out and seeing Katniss finally realize and do something about the people using her.<br /><br />Consistent with the rest of the series, a lot of people are lost in this one which is why I consider it the saddest out of the three books. But the ending was just about perfect, in my opinion. Although, I would have liked to have a bit more explanation on Katniss and her life after everything is settled. I will say that I'm ecstatic with who she ends up with!<br /><br />Even though this is the last in this series, I still hope there will be more one day about Katniss and the rest of the clan. I would really love to know how the new society is thriving and what the next generation has to come.<br /><br />This is one series I wholeheartedly recommend!

B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought this was a great installment to the series. While everything should have been fine and dandy with Katniss and Peeta just winning the Hunger Games, it soon becomes known that things have just gotten worse and their lives are again going to be shaken up.<br /><br />I have to say I was shocked with how the story turned out. I wasn't expecting it to go in the direction it went but I liked the way it progressed. We meet a bunch of new people, victors of previous Hunger Games, and we get to revisit Katniss and Peeta's lives which I enjoyed a lot because I love these two.<br /><br />We get to see more of Gale and District 12 as well as the Capitol and President Snow. I loved Katniss and Peeta just as much in this book as I did in the first one. Gale grew on me a bit more but I still want Katniss to end up with Peeta not Gale! Grrr!<br /><br />This one wasn't as intense and suspenseful as the previous one but it still had me just as interested. I loved reading about all the new animals the Capitol created and seeing how Katniss and Peeta were affected by them. Plus, I loved Finnick. Absolutely adored him! And I loved Nuts and Volts. They cracked me up. But like the first book, we end up losing some of the characters we grow fond of so be prepared for the inevitable!<br /><br />This is definitely one of my favorite series! Even if this book ended on a major cliffhanger! I'm just thankful the third book is already out.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|As a novice participator in BDSM, I have found most romance books centered around the subject to be tame, predictable and dull. E.L.James however has spun that world on its heels!<br /><br />This book moved me in so many ways; from her word choices to her imagery, to the way she skillfully masters so many complex personalities without muddling them up halfway through. I had almost given up hope that there was a BDSM novelist out there who could write a really GOOD book. James writes not just one but THREE (this is book one of the trilogy).<br /><br />This is the tale of Ana - a virgin college graduate who is just stepping out into her \\"big girl\\" shoes, so to speak and Christian Grey - a Master at all things BDSM who has an extremely advanced understanding of dominating because he started out as a submissive himself. Ana meets Grey and the attraction seems instant, not in a flowery \\"boy meets girl\\" kind of way but in an intellectual, powerful, intimidatingly mind-blowing kind of way. Grey is immediately taken with Ana as well, and while she can't see it right away, James makes it more than clear to the audience reading about it.<br /><br />There's something to be said about the magic that happens between Dom and sub, if you haven't experienced it, you won't know exactly what you're missing out on, but this book sure does give you a good inkling about it!<br /><br />*****UPDATE*****<br /><br />After finishing the series I am SORELY disappointed by Jame's depiction of BDSM couples. She seriously needs an explanation of what Sexual Sadism is verses the sadism you find in BDSM (at least in HEALTHY BDSM relationships). I am absolutely appalled by some of the stuff Ana winds up dealing with from the childish Mr. Grey.<br /><br />E L James had a GREAT thing going, but she totally ruins it with books 2 and 3 of this series. If you are at all interested in BDSM take note: DONT DATE ANYONE like Mr. Grey. Ever. For that matter, even if you're totally vanilla, it's probably wiser to stay away from the over jealous, super rich, annoyingly adolescent adults out there.r to stay away from the over jealous, super rich, annoyingly adolescent adults out there.
1401937519|1.0|DON\\"T WASTE YOUR MONEY. If you believe in Jesus or any other prophet. This is a book to make money from a starving greedy person.<br />I disagree with everything she says, I believe this is an orchestrated dilema book in case anybody requests proof of her being sick. She suggests that we are all holy regardless of whether you are a child rapist a murderer, a monk, priest or pastor. According to her no one is more spiritual or holy than the other, is just that the rapist and murderer  live in fear. She also says that you should live your life driven by your emotions, in other words if your emotion today is to kill your neighbor, not a problem that is nature, you'll be a holy person regardless. She is contardicting the teachings of the greatest man that's ever lived JESUS CHRIST, and others such as Siddhartha. I am amazed at how many 5 star rating this book has; even more amazed that Wayne Dyer supports this book. Again it's all about the money,(Not amazed). I don't believe she was even sick, let alone having a NDE. The last chapters are extremely repetitive, and tedious, I ddn't finish reading the book. I beleive many people fell for this because it makes them feel good, not living an honest life. It gives them a reason to live a mundane and non spiritual life. Basically she denies God, she says she is part of God and she does not have to do anything to earn a place near God in the after life. She wants to say that she is God herself, but then people wouldn't buy this book if she did.<br />Regardless of whether you are a Christian or non believer, you can't live your life driven by your emotions, just because you had a bad day at work, you can't come home beating up your kids and spouse. This person suggests that you should let your emotions flow and not stop at anything. I DON'T THINK SO!!<br />Don't waste your money! There is no truth in this book whatsoever, just fiction.
B005LAJ212|5.0|My wife & I love this show. It is one of our favorites, but if it is not released in blu-ray, we will not be gettting the dvd.
B0073XORCY|5.0|This is the first review I have written for Amazon but I am compelled to write about this album. I had to leave work with the flu today on the CD's release day but stopped off to pick it up on my way home. I will prefix this by saying I have been a Tull fan since the Benefit days and was always drawn to Ian's work. What  attracted me was his unique sound from the Celtic influences to the alternating between the electric passages and the acoustic parts. It has always been music that was meant to really be listened to. Most of all, Ian transported me to England and the albums are etched in my mind forever. This new music is simply wonderful as it incorporates many of the types of sounds that Ian is famous for. Look, Martin Barre will always be a part of Jethro Tull but Ian has played with many people. The question is whether you find the music inspiring. As crappy as I feel today, I am moved by this cd. I think it is one of Ian's finest efforts in recent years. It also touches on real subjects and makes us think about everything from TV ministers (Give Till It Hurts), to the banking industry, to politics, to that constant battle between good and evil. Another point about Ian Anderson and his sound. Have you ever thought about the fact that there has been just about nobody who has crafted a sound anything like his. When you think about the evolution of popular music, it is really special to carve out a niche with a unique sound that cannot and has not been duplicated. The CD actually is cut into different sections so those of you that like to hop from track to track can easily do it. For me, call me old or old fashioned but I enjoy hearing and experiencing the complete piece of work. By the way, I would highly recommend the deluxe edition which comes with a DVD. There is a behind the scenes look at the making of the album. In addition, the part of the DVD I really liked was Ian Anderson reading the lyrics and telling the story of the album. The mixing is done by StevenWilson of Porcupine Tree and he did a fine job as I have been listening on my system.  The booklet and the written materials took time and thought. Ian, there are many of us out there that will always appreciate the effort you put into your craft and just get so much pleasure from your music.
0440178002|5.0|Many others have said it how wonderful this book is.  I'll just agree and add it's so good, it's worth reading again and again and again.
B000002GQE|5.0|Man, oh man, the DSS version of this album is great!  Totally 100% better sound than the original CD release on Threshhold.  This is the album that originated the idea of rock mixed with classical and (dare I say it?) the beginning of progressive rock.  The Moodies would go on to release many more excellent albums, but fans always come back to this fantastic piece of music.  Innovative, exciting, moving and original, classical/rock doesn't get better than this.<br /><br />But the best thing about this particular release is the sound.  This is definitely an audiophile's dream pressing of this album.  I haven't heard the MSFL, but I can't image it sounding all that much better.  Yes, this DSS IS THAT GOOD!!
B003Q6D27S|5.0|I am not a horror fan. I hate blood, guts, and gore. The reason Saw appealed to me, and the reason I watched it all the way through to the \\"end\\" is because of the psychological aspect. This review will be for the series as a whole, as each individual movie does not deserve 5 stars. The quality fluctuated among the movies and this last one was probably not the best.<br /><br />The first Saw was probably the best one (although that is usually the case when a movie goes on and on for ten years). I was absolutely fascinated at Jigsaw's idea of teaching his \\"victims\\" a lesson. He was going about it the wrong way, of course, by torturing them, but it was still fascinating. And even if the first was the highest quality, the fifth was my personal favorite. Jigsaw and the movie attacking the insurance industry was just so amazing.<br /><br />Here were my problems:<br />1. You simply cannot orchestrate killing so many people after you are dead. No one is that good at planning ahead. That right there is the best reason for not having so many sequels.<br />2. Jigsaw's victims are so grateful for the lessons they learned that they turn around and help him in his quest to \\"teach others lessons.\\" That is, gruesome murder. That is believable ONCE. How many times did it happen by movie 7? Four?<br />3. How does Jigsaw have all these huge, empty warehouses that he can fill will all these huge traps that the police do not know about? Is he a billionaire or what?<br />4. The traps would never work that perfectly like clockwork the way that they do. Just the fact that the TV screens always pop on with Jigsaw's message the exact second the victim wakes up is highly unlikely. (If you watch the special features, they sometimes had trouble getting the traps to work for filming... and that's with all the people right there WITH the traps! And multiple people who built them!)<br /><br />Anyway, suspend your disbelief (for a ridiculous number of things), watch it for the psychological aspect, and you have an enjoyable movie franchise. I don't generally like horror, so I don't own too many horror movies, but I would probably rate this as my all-time favorite horror series. It lasted too long... they probably should have quit while they were ahead. But they still did a pretty good job, as all 7 movies kept my attention and all 7 movies went together well and connected the pieces that were missing from previous movies. That's another thing you don't often see: sometimes sequels ignore what you have previously learned, but these movies went together so perfectly, it was scary.<br /><br />The final problem was that this \\"Final Chapter\\" was not so final. There were still a few loose ends. Will there be an eighth chapter? Even though I have enjoyed the series, I don't really hope so... unless it actually wraps it up for good. It has to end sometime, before it wears out its welcome. Which it sort of already did. It's just that those of us who are die-hard fans need to see how it ends that we kept watching this long.and you have an enjoyable movie franchise.

It's poppy and sugary, then it's gleefully twisted, finally it's romantic (YESSS! She's returned to making ballads!) and lastly a little somber.  It's my favorite Madonna album since American Life.

B0059XTTW8|3.0|Viewers' reactions to this movie must depend, in large part, on their expectations and their history with the novel and '70s era BBC miniseries.  Le Carre may be one of the great British novelists of the last 50 years who simply happened to mine the vein of espionage fiction and was at the peak of his powers, and ideally suited to deal with the Cold War milieu, in the \\"Smiley Trilogy\\": Tinker Tailor, Smiley's People and The Honourable Schoolboy.  If you are a fan of the novel, and watch the movie making constant comparisons, you will probably be disappointed. Le Carre's fiction is challenging, layered and deeply perceptive, and the events are intricately interwoven.  A two hour movie simply cannot convey all the novel has to offer, omits and changes certain significant details, merges characters, and did not, for me, convey the deep ambiguities and analysis of betrayal at the heart of the novel. The movie also failed to create a great deal of suspence.<br />Likewise, a viewer who has recently seen the 1979 BBC miniseries starring Alec Guiness as George Smiley also will be disappointed. Guiness was terrific and managed to make of Smiley a much deeper and more complex character than does Gary Oldman in the time allotted to him. The cast of the miniseries also was brilliant, from Hywel Bennett as Ricki Tarr, through Ian Richardson, Bernard Hepton, Terence Rigby, Sian Phillips, Joss Ackland, Patrick Stewart, Ian Bannen, et al.  The miniseries was probably one of the best ever BBC productions and had the time (about 5.5 hours) to develop most all of the characters of the novel, explore its subtleties, and make sense of and explain the interconnectedness of the various strands of the plot that come together and allow Smiley to find the \\"mole.\\" Again, if you watch the movie comparing it constantly to the miniseries, I think you will be disappointed. There is a lot left out, many of the characters are barely developed, Anne, Smiley's wife, doesn't appear at all, except obliquely in a few scenes, and the sense of mystery and drama in the miniseries is much greater--you are literally on the edge of your seat in the scene in which the traitor is unmasked.<br />That being said, obviously, condensing the book to two hours must have been a daunting challenge, but the movie is still enjoyable and far from a failure. Gary Oldman is good as Smiley, but seems to play most of the movie in a passive state of shock.  Smiley is a damaged and conflicted man, beset by betrayal on all sides, but Oldman's protrayal is, for me, too strangely passive, and I don't think we get a feeling for what Smiley is all about.  Similarly, the other \\"suspects,\\" meaning the power elite at the Circus (British Intelligence), are well enough acted, but hardly developed at all. SPOILER ALERT  My main complaint has to do with one of the finer actors in the cast, Colin Firth, who plays Bill Haydon.  Haydon is supposed to be the \\"golden boy\\" of the Circus, the \\"laughing cavalier\\" whom the younger generation venerates and so talented and magnetic that, according to Prideaux (in the novel and miniseries) \\"you just can't judge Bill by ordinary standards.\\"  Unfortunately, we really don't see enough of Haydon to understand the nature and magnitude of his betrayal.  It would be unfair, however, not to note that John Hurt is excellent as Control.<br />I also have to wonder whether the movie will simply make sense to viewers who come unprepared. For example, we don't quite get the idea that the failed Hungarian gambit (why it has been changed from Czechoslovakia, I don't know) was Control's last ditch attempt to unmask the traitor, and I didn't find it clear in the movie how Tarr's final assignment was designed to flush out the traitor (very clear in the book and miniseries).  There are a host of other changes of which one could complain: the merging of Jerry Westerby and Sam Collins, the sexual orientation of Peter Guillam, the absence of Anne, the absence of Karla (instead of a scene between Smiley and Karla we get only Smiley's tale of their encounter).  --But of course I am inevitably comparing the movie with the other versions.<br />All in all, if you have some background with the book or the miniseries, I think that comparisons will be inevitable and the movie certainly has not improved on either version.  At the same time, as thin as it sometimes is, the movie is worth watching. The acting is solid, there is enough suspence to keep things interesting, and the atmosphere is effective.  At the least, perhaps it will encourage viewers to read the book or watch the miniseries, both of which are excellent.ene between Smiley and Karla we get only Smiley's tale of their encounter).  --But of course I am inevitably comparing the movie with the other versions.<br />All in all, if you have some background with the book or the miniseries, I think that comparisons will be inevitable and the movie certainly has not improved on either version.

They did a really lovely job (some of the \\"paper engineering\\" is damn brilliant, exactly as the little prince would've done it); I'm a devoted fan of the little prince & I think they improved (which I didnt think could be possible!) the original while definitely honoring the vision & intention of the author.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|I have always been a huge George Harrison fan so this review may be somewhat slanted.  I liked the fact these recordings have all been refreshed.  Each disc sounds fantastic.  I had never heard the live from Japan recording and it is really well done and in SACD format.  I enjoyed the videos and interviews as well.  I always like to hear George Harrison's explanations of his music.  The 33 1/3 videos were awesome.  I can remember when he appeared on SNL and introduced the \\"This Song\\" and \\"Crackerbox Palace\\" videos.  If you are a George Harrison fan then you must get this set!

0553386794|5.0|I didn't expect to like this as much as I did. I promised my 17yo daughter I would buy her a copy and it took 2 stores to find one a copy, and the copy I found had a little cover damage but my daughter didn't blink an eye. In three days, she'd already finished the book. My wife was watching one of those supernanny shows and the book was lying on the coffee table so I figured I would see what all the hype was about. Now I understand. I enjoyed seeing the point of view of many of the characters throughout the novel. They were all fun to read about and picking a favorite would be impossible, you'll like them for different reasons.<br /><br />For readers who like stories with the depth of character that can be found in this book, I recommend [[ASIN:0985081821 The Forever Girl: Forever Girl Series, Volume One: Sophia's Journey (Volume 1)]] or [[ASIN:0060557818 Neverwhere: A Novel]]. Both of those books, like Game of Thrones, are full of interesting characters and endearing turns of phrase. The tone between these three novels are different but equally enjoyable for those who appreciate a wide array of fantasy.
0553801473|5.0|This is an awesome series. Martin goes nuts with books 1, 3 & 5 of this series. He tends to take it slowly with books 2 and 4 (...hated the strategy for book 4), but the entire series is like literary crack. I love it - can't wait for book 6.
0812992792|4.0|[[ASIN:0812992792 The Orphan Master's Son: A Novel]]<br />I applaud the author for writing a challenging novel from the viewpoint of fictional North Koreans.  North Korea is such an odd and isolated nation that I must confess I rarely give it much thought.  After reading this novel, I have great sympathy for the people of North Korea, coupled with great revulsion regarding its leaders.<br /><br />Not a breezy read!  Lots of very disturbing events and images.  I found the transitions rather hard to follow (probably due to the reader) and thought it was a bit too long.  Overall, if you're up for a challenge, go for it!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|***Note to readers...This review may contain spoilers.<br /><br />When I began the first book, I was immediately attached to Katniss and her family members, particularly Prim. I think that Katniss' viewpoints accurately represented those of a teenage girl in post-modern times and her suspicious nature was a welcome variation from most young adult literature. Collins develops the characters such that the reader eagerly awaits the next portion of their tale(s).<br /><br />After reading several of the previously posted reviews, I was under the impression that the final book of the trilogy would have some sort of twisted, unexpected ending. This impression was based particularly on one review which warned readers who were looking for a story-book ending that they would be disappointed by the conclusion trilogy. However, when I put down the book, I was somewhat disappointed because of how predictable the ending really was. Despite Katniss's wavering feelings for both Gale and Peeta, her intense determination to revive Peeta to his pre-torture self suggested her long-term plans to partner with him (even if these plans were unknown to Katniss at the time). While the death of some of the important characters does deviate from the fairy tale norm, war does not discriminate, and Collins captured that idea quite well.<br /><br />I also had some of the problems with my digital copy that were outlined in others' reviews; my text size changed occassionally when the page was turned and the numeration was not always accurate.<br /><br />Despite my criticisms, I was intrigued and engrossed by the triolgy. I would recommend the text to both boys and girls above the age of 10 or 11, especially those who enjoyed other survivalist novels, such as Hatchet.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I started out hating this series, but it grew on me. Now that I've finished it I miss it. By main gripe with the book is that Katniss, having lived a hard live, acts more like a Valley Girl than a survivor. Living that close to the earth, in a harsh world with the threat of death on a daily basis, well, that makes you grow up fast. She hasn't. Hasn't a clue, actually.<br /><br />But while others disliked the ending, I found it worked well. My gripe was with the climax. I won't spoil it. It's a great twist, yet left me unsatisfied. How this plot twist could be executed with no future ramifications for Katniss eludes me.<br /><br />So four stars for a so-so book.<br /><br />Three stars because of the Kindle editors are delivering their usual, botched content. How long as the Kindle been around? And these people STILL can't get it right!

B0073XORCY|3.0|Thick As a Brick 2 can't compare to the original thanks to a lack of Ian's vocal range and an even bigger lack of memorable instrumental melodies- the two main reasons I adore the original Thick As a Brick.  Those expecting daring tempo changes and amazing vocal melodies that take advantage of Ian's talents that stretch far and beyond will be VERY disappointed.<br /><br />\\"From a Pebble Thrown\\" is a disappointingly generic and mid-tempo way of kicking things off, and even though it's been 40 years and I realize things can change a LOT in that amount of time, Ian's current voice is an embarrassment compared to the one he had in his golden years.  Let's just be honest here- it is.  \\"Pebbles Instrumental\\" is an instrumental that drags and drags and never features any memorable notes.  The main flute riff is especially insulting since it sounds like it consists of just a few notes played in the most generic way imaginable.  \\"Might-have-beens\\" is a short poem spoken by a downbeat and depressed Ian Anderson.  \\"Upper Sixth Loan Shark\\" is a short lullaby that's tolerable so at least it has that going for it.  One moment that's NOT tolerable is around the 43-second mark when Ian strains his voice.  Ugh!  You're not young anymore!  Of course age wouldn't matter if he could still hit the high notes but he obviously can't.  \\"Banker Bets, Banker Wins\\" contains a plodding vocal melody that tries to be energetic but it's done in a limping and unremarkable kind of way.  I do admire the flute solo at the end so it's not completely terrible.<br /><br />Now the album improves... at least temporarily.  \\"Swing It Far\\" is a song that contains shades of classic Tull thanks to the switch from soft to heavy in a blink of an eye- this is the kind of creativity that makes me admire the original Thick As a Brick.  We need more unpredictable moments like these throughout the entire album in addition to Ian willing to creatively extend his vocal range like in the older days.  \\"Adrift & Dumfounded\\" is tolerable but the secondrate guitar riffage and soloing around the 2-minute mark hurts it.  Still, it's not a bad song by any means.  Then again I could say the same about most of the material here- nothing is really *bad* at all!  \\"Old School Song\\" contains portions of the original TAAB theme and actually builds on that theme for the entire song.  Decent vocals and flue work- pretty good actually.  \\"Wooton Bassett Town\\" is mellow and orchestrated and has a fairly catchy vocal melody.  This album is suddenly improving.<br /><br />Until now...<br /><br />\\"Power & Spirit\\" has a forgettably mellow vocal melody and the heavier section is the most uninteresting feature about it.  \\"Give Till It Hurts\\" is a brief acoustic song with relevant lyrics.  It's pretty good.  \\"Cosy Corner\\" is forgettable filler with no real insightful melody or anything worthy about it- sounds like clown music with terrible lyrics such as \\"Don't forget to call your mom\\".  What?  lol.  \\"Shunt & Shuffle\\" works thanks to a nice foot-tapper rhythm and a passable vocal melody.  \\"A Change of Horses\\" is a MAJOR weak point that reminds me of the stomach-turning 80's Tull albums in both the glossy production and artificially limp vocal melody.  Oh and in case you're wondering- it sounds NOTHING like Tull's classic \\"Heavy Horses\\" (both song and album).  The uncreative instrumental work that drags on and on is what hurts it the most, actually.  I hate this song with a passion, no kidding.  This song reeks like yesterdays crab-filled trash.<br /><br />\\"Confessional\\" has an uninteresting vocal melody that sort of sounds Thick As a Brick-ish... I guess.  I mean if I had to give it any kind of compliment whatsoever, a comparison to that legendary 1972 album is the best I can do.  \\"Kismet In Suburbia\\" is another forgettable rocker limping endlessly with no quality vocal melody to save it.  \\"What-ifs, Maybes & Might-have-beens\\" accurately sums up this entire experience!  It's not a bad song though- a nice way to wrap up a disappointing album.  Maybe I'm just happy that this mediocre writing has finally reached its conclusion.  The vocal melody certainly has hints from the one from \\"Heavy Horses\\" and I suppose it's nice to end the album with about 20 seconds of the original Thick As a Brick melody- even if that's clearly the highlight of the entire album.<br /><br />I think it'd be best to skip over this and stick with the original Thick As a Brick.  You're not missing much here folks, and it's basically a continuation of the Jethro Tull and Ian Anderson solo materal we've been hearing for 30 years now.  True excitement and creativity is not included here and apparently is a thing of the past if this is supposed to be the best Ian can come up with.
B006WWP5KA|5.0|BEST SHOW EVER!!!!  I am copmletely hooked.  Have watched every episode through season 3, episode 12 in the last 7 days.
B005CGI4EG|4.0|I love this show and this is a great price for the whole series, but the only thing from me giving this 5 stars is the way the discs are all jammed packed together and it can be hard to get one disc out. I suggest putting all the discs in a CD binder for easier use, but for all 11 seasons for about 40 bucks, you just can't beat that awesome price!
B003VANOFY|4.0|I love this headset. It is very sexy and built to last like most of Logitech's products. The best feature is by far that it's wireless. I can literally be 40 feet away from my bedroom upstairs, in my kitchen downstairs and still have a conversation with someone on Skype. The battery lasts around 8 hoursObviously your milage will vary with wireless, so don't expect your house to let you do the same, but overall I think you'll really like the range you'll get form these. Things you'll want to worry about that create interference for wireless use are: multiple wireless networks, 2.4GHz wireless phones, bluetooth devices, a microwave, large metal objects or shielding inside walls, Direct Satellite Service (DSS) radio frequency (RF) leakage, Power lines, railroad tracks and power stations, Pacemakers, Hearing aids, the list goes on. Some great reading on wifi Interference can be found by googling \\"20 Myths of Wi-Fi Interference\\".<br /><br />***Comfort: I'll admit that a headset isn't going to feel like a feather on your head after 3 hours of gaming, or whatever you do when using it. It's big and kinda bulky, but that doesn't bug me. Surprisingly it is very comfortable after prolonged use. If you have longer hair I'd recommend putting into a pony tail while you use these. If you tend to perspire a lot then perhaps use a small desk fan to help. I do perspire and I haven't found these to be a huge contributing factor to it if I make sure that the room I'm playing in is adequately ventilated.<br /><br />***Sound Quality: This is where I feel this product lacks luster. overall the sound is...well...just ok. It suffers most on the low end where a lot of distortion comes through when anything with a lot of bass is played. This is most noticeable in games that have load sounds with low frequencies. Explosions from rag grenades or loud gunshots tend to cause the drivers to bottom out. This can be mitigated by adjusting the EQ settings a little, but I feel that the sound quality of this headset is it's weakest link.<br /><br />***Build Quality: Logitech has used quality parts to build this headset, and it shows because they offer a 2 year warranty on it. If taken care of this could last much longer than just 2 years. Sure something better will be out by then, but it's nice to know that you can depend on a product to last the duration of it's warranty period.<br /><br />***Ease of Use: You'll need a basic understanding of computers to get this working, but if you are a computer enthusiast or even just a casual gamer then I don't think you'll have any issues at all getting things set up. Honestly it is almost plug and play. Just plug it in and install the drivers. The bigest obstacle is making sure that the headset itself is setup as your audio device in windows or in each application you will use independently.<br /><br />***Overall: I feel that for most FPS players these will be a disappointment because the lower end frequencies aren't handled well so you'll get distortion a lot. For those that play RTS or RPGs these are great. It's sad that the biggest group of users (FPS players) will be the ones to deal with the issue of distortion more than others. Tweak it with the EQ settings and it sounds better, but it is still a little disappointing. I feel that when you look at the headset as an entire product it is worth money you'll put out for it.
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|My daughter and I have seen every horror movie that has ever come out.  This one is one of the best!!!  If you like scary movies, this one truly is scary.  It isn't even in English...has subtitles, but still a great, scary movie!!!
B0065CCT6U|5.0|Oh my freakin' god! This man can sing! I am not a fan of most 90's grunge music but I listened to this and was floored by the pure emotion coming through in Chris' voice, not encumbered by a wall of distorted guitars. Just skip to his cover of \\"Thank You\\" by Led Zep. It's pretty darn amazing stuff.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|excellent, horror, is a very good movie, with the surprise at the end suppose to be the first one and then the one from the 80's, very cool.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I love this series. I love this book. I am however, very distracted by all of the freaking typos, mis-punctuated, and spacing errors. I REALLY wish this book was proof read a bit better.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I wasn't expecting this to be more than original Quell with new puzzles. Imagine my surprise when I encountered the new features! Once again, a truly awesome, relaxing, challenging game where I keep the soundtrack turned on.

B001QWBM62|5.0|I'm a professional classical musician, and the zoom h4n is an excellent piece of equipment for self recording and transfers easily to hard drive for making audition CDs.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|The main problem I have when it comes to reading is the amount of light.... I like reading in a dark room with a single bright light focused on the page and that's exactly why I like this app. Plus it allows me to pick the Color of my choosing.

B00543RC0Y|4.0|The Blu-ray collections include all seven series of Harry Potter movies. In the first 3 disks, it also has Chinese (as well as other languages) caption, which eases our watching. Very good collections to see all Harry Potter's movies.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you wont be able to put down this game.  there is a game for everyone and the best is waiting to see what's next
B007MU85D0|5.0|The single on the album, \\"Little Talks,\\" is a high-energy, brass-filled track that you'll want to sing along with before you know the words.  It is very catchy, and the medieval lyrics coupled with the vocalists british accents gives it a Decemberists feel.  What makes this album so great is that almost all the songs are just as good as their radio single.  My wife found herself humming the melody to \\"King and Lionheart\\" without even knowing what band was stuck in her head.  Whimsical, light-hearted, but deep and epic at the same time.  I would definitely buy this album if you like The Decemberists, The Shins, Tilly and the Wall, Vampire Weekend, etc.
B005PW3OS8|1.0|movie was great  but the video stopped a few times  had to reset where it ended  have not watch a single amazon movie that not  a promblem  have no promblem  with you tube  should went to red box  amazon  almost as bad as crackle movies  i have a good internet connection  amazon  troubling quality  bob
B002ZG974M|3.0|I couldn't get through this film until I was 4 months pregnant. Otherwise, without dialog, it was too boring. (I found the cats more entertaining to watch.) I'm not one of these people that thinks babies are cute so perhaps if you are, you'll like it more.<br /><br />As a parent-to-be, I found the contrast between the consumer lifestyle of first world countries with third-world countries very interesting. I was also intrigued with other culture's hands-off approach to parenting. But, after watching the movie, I find that it didn't probe these differences enough for me to make a decision about which method is healthier. In fact, it mostly confused the issue. (Some might say that the movie was not trying to indicate one method was better than another... but I think, very subtly, it was definitely criticizing first world methods and presenting the \\"Noble Savage\\" methods as something more respectful.)<br /><br />For instance, in one scene, an African baby takes the toy of his older sibling. The older sibling takes it back. The baby hits him. The older sibling hits back. The baby cries and no one comes to comfort him because no one is watching them. As a viewer, my first reaction was, \\"Well, that will teach the baby not to take toys and hit! I'm glad the mother didn't rush in and scold the older sibling.\\"<br /><br />But, then, later, I watched an older Mongolian toddler full out attack his younger baby brother and no one intervened. He simply kept hitting the baby until he got bored. All the while, the baby was crying. No one came to his rescue. Then, the minute that little baby learned to stand the first thing he did was reach over and grab someone who was smaller than him and made her cry. What had he learned? If you are bigger, you can beat up on those smaller than yourself.<br /><br />So, which is best? Give children less supervision and let them sort it out for themselves, risking that one child will abuse the other, or intervene and risk over-protecting your child?Which is the worse evil? Over protection or a bullied/bullying child? The film did not answer these questions or even probe these questions deeply.<br /><br />Also, I found it a little distasteful that the film makers rushed to make fun of \\"first-worlders\\". The scene where the little girl in Japan had a room full of toys and seemed bored and unhappy was contrasted with the little boy in Mongolia who was tied to a bed and was SOOO happy to get a roll of toilet paper to play with. The message, \\"We give our children too much!\\" was loud and clear throughout the film. But at this point, I thought, \\"WAIT! We don't know if the baby in Japan was bored and unhappy because of her toys. She could simply be overdue for a nap! Also, I bet the boy in Mongolia has similar, cranky, overstimulated days and moments, also!\\" It got me wondering if I was actually being presented with the truth of the situation or with a trendy message about American consumerism.<br /><br />And the little clips of the San Fran couple singing tribal songs about the earth mother with their children while inter cut with clips of the real African tribe... come on! Everybody knows we're suppose to laugh at the stupid Americans at this point. All that did was make me wonder at the agenda of the film-makers and if they were presenting an accurate picture of both American parenting and other culture's.<br /><br />So, was it worth my time to watch as a parent-to-be? Yes. It will definitely make me think more about being too over-protective and too involved in my child's life. But other than as a \\"caution sign\\" in the back of mind, I'm not sure if this film is actually going to change any of my parenting behaviors (I'm still going to buy tons of learning toys because is it better to risk over-stimulating the child, sometimes, or risk under stimulating the baby's brain and s/he lags in development?) So, see it but expect it to confuse you a little bit about how to parent and don't expect it to answer any questions.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This app was so much fun. I really enjoyed playing it. After the update it stopped force closing and I beat it. I enjoyed playing all the levels and quests. It was very enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well now I certainly know what all the hype is about! I was really reluctant to read this because all of the hype was so over whelming. I never experienced this feeling with my favorite series Twilight because I fell in love with it before all of the hype began. It definitely lived up to the hype all of the way. It is stylish, exciting fresh and new. It is a brilliant Dystopian novel.<br /><br />With all of the Dystopian novels out there I can never get enough of them for some reason. I know its such a bleak genre right? Right. But their filled with so much excitement! I found the events leading up to The Hunger Games interesting but was really holding my breath for them to start and when they did oh my! It captivated me and kept my face glued to my Kindle. The world inside and outside of the arena was so well developed; Panem is soooo not a place I want to live in. A lot of the animals,plants and just the world of Panem was extremely unique and kept me interested.<br /><br />Because of the action and constant flow of the story there wasn't a lot of room for character development but the little bit we get on secondary characters is really extraordinary given the pace of the story. I really loved Katniss and Rue....hate thinking about Rue.... but I loved her! The only thing I didn't like about Katniss was how she second guessed Peeta so much, it got kind of annoying for me. I thought she was a wonderful heroine though.<br /><br />Was I totally captivated? Yes. Is it my favorite series? No. However,  I own the other two books in the series and will be reading them soon. There is a lot coming out in the movies that I want to see....The Raven anyone? So, I'll have to see  if I can see the movie if not will definitely will catch it on DVD.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5<br />Rated: Pg-13 Brutal, Brutal Violence but nothing a teen hasn't seen before.
B005DI65L2|2.0|As a life-long dog lover, this book title immediately caught my interest.  However, I found the contents of the book to be dry.  In between long academic passages, I did glean snippets of interesting information.<br />The interesting parts disipated too quickly and I kept putting the book down, rather than picking it up.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This book is the best book that I have ever read!  I could not put it down!  It was an excellent start to the triology of Fifty Shades!  All my friends are reading the triology now .  Enjoyable, excellent reading![[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B00756GKBA|1.0|I'm in my late 20's, born in the eighties. So I was born listening to Madonna and loved her but this album is a joke. A complete and utter joke. Her old music is great and fun to listen to. This is just noise, a headache inducing nightmare. Seriously she's done producing any music at her age. They say people are like a fine wine, getting better with age but she is vinegar now. I've had enough! She says the comparisons to GaGa have been reductive...THIS ALBUM has been reductive to MUSIC in general.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|This book was just a very excellent part of the triology .  Totally enjoyed the story!  It's must read.  Could not put the book down![[ASIN:0345803493 Fifty Shades Darker: Book Two of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]S
B005VT42BS|5.0|This app is a fantastic tool to have on Android. It looks good and performs great. Most importantly, it sends WoL perfectly. Another great thing is that it allows you to enter custom names for devices on your network, which is great for keeping track of authorized access.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I don't usually like short stories but this is the exception.  Great, scary story--I loved every word!  With a little more story development, it would make a fabulous horror movie.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|I was always a bit skeptical about taking old films to Blu-Ray but this transfer is perfect.  There is a crispness and depth that comes through and makes it look new.  This is one of my favorite movies and this 70th Anniversary set was a real treat.  There is a lot of special features, I particularly liked the one on director Micheal Curtiz.  If you periodically have to dim the lights and dwell at Rick's for a while then I'd recommend this release.
0439023491|5.0|If you love the first book The Hunger Games, then you will love the second book in the series. It has all the characters you love from the first book and adds some new lovable characters to the mix. I highly recommend this for a great read. I just warn you that when you read this you WILL want to read the third one right after this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its the best the only hard part is getting enough points to unlock the next game
B007NZDES0|5.0|SADE IS THE QUEEN OF MUSIC. I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THIS DVD IS RELEASED. I SAW HER IN CONCERT, BROUGHT HER FLOWERS AND RECEIVED ALL HER AUTOGRAPHS. SHE IS VERY TALENTED, AND HER VOICE IS ALWAYS THE BEST VOICE OF ALL SINGERS. SHE IS GODDESS, AND I WILL BE THRILLED AND SO HAPPY TO GET HER FIFTH DVD. I OWN THE LAST FOUR: LIVE IN MUNICH, LIFE PROMISE PRIDE LOVE, LIVE 1993 AND LOVERS ROCK LIVE. I AM A HUGE FUN OF HERS.
0545405777|2.0|I don't have much more to say than the other folks that gave this book one or two stars.  The idea and story line have some merit but the writing is unbelievably poor.  There's no depth to either the characters or the story and it's so full of clichés that it's almost funny.  If you're interested in this genre try The Lottery, The Most Dangerous Game (short), or even the Clan of the Cave Bear series which has some great survivalist sections.  I believe this series will soon be forgotten.  But I am curious to see what they did with the movie...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my son loves this app. he cant wait to get points, beat games and buy new games. id recommend downloading this
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Best weather app out there, and only for $2.99 you can't beat that price considering the pristine detail and accuracy. I strongly recommend getting instead of wasting time with lesser, more glitchy weather apps.
B004U52VPS|1.0|2 boxes with 5 and 7 items and all Chinese copy!!! Search for Mattel logotype to prove you have official game!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Thoroughly enjoy.  Beats fooling with cards and having to clear space on a table or desk plus you can walk away midgame and comeback whenever it is convenient.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome and extremely convenient! I love how it connects with your online profile and the ease in which you can share verses and notes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was absolutely fantastic! I could not put it down and the second and third ones are just as good! When my cousin started reading it I wasn't very interested. It sounded cruel and sad and lame to me. Why would anyone want to read about kids killing each other? But one day I just picked it up and read the first few pages thinking \\"it's ok\\" then once I got past chapter 1 or 2 i could not stop reading and was completely captivated by this book! Suzanne Collins is a literary genius and I recommend this trilogy to anyone who likes fantasy and a little romance. Seriously read these books! You will love them for the rest of your life! (unless you're crazy) :D
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I ordered the Hunger Games with some hesitation knowing<br />that it was supposed to be for teenagers, but I figured<br />I like the Twilight series and Harry Potter so why not.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the books.  I think that there are<br />several levels at which they could be enjoyed.<br />If you are a teen maybe the adventure and romance would<br />be more important to you than the political commentary<br />that adults have seen in these stories.  I like to<br />think I am young at heart and I liked it all.<br />Would highly recommend to all ages.<br />[[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is disturbing in it's nature but compelling and fresh from it's perspective.  A very easy read for the most part with engaging characters and action.  It does have some overwrought plot devices and some characters that are hard to read but life in district 12 as well as life in the Hunger Games seems very real and interesting from the narrative.  So that is the good.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  This book is a cliff hanger to CF which is a cliff hanger to MJ. You know, the trilogy.  That's fine, everybody knows it is a trilogy.  I just expected the last two books in the trilogy to be reasonably good, right? Wrong!  They get progressively worse.  Just so you know in advance....<br /><br />HG = 5 Stars<br />CF = 3 Stars<br />MJ = 1 Star<br /><br />Sorry to disappoint...
B004GVUPFE|5.0|Well balanced and a great deal of content to keep you engaged.  Enjoyable for both kids and adults, with well polished content and good music.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The trilogy started out so wonderfully with the Hunger Games.  Sure HG wasn't without fault but what book is perfect to every taste?  However it was well thought out and original so despite annoyances with some of the plot contrivances/melodrama the book was overall fresh and the characters were well developed and interesting.  5 STARS!<br /><br />Next was Catching Fire, second of the trilogy.  Second books in trilogy's are by their nature stodgy and hard to love.  Catching Fire was no exception but even with my lowered expectations it was a failure.  So 3 Stars even with lowered expectations.  Especially disheartening was the Quarter Quell induction of Katness and Peeta...and then they meekly go off like cattle to the slaughter with all the rest of the victors.  Really?  Repeat the hunger games in the next book?  How very anti-creative.  Katniss and Gayle who can make it alone in the woods...but never try?  But hey the author is saving up for a grand finale with Mockingjay right?  WRONG!  Anyway, 3 Stars for CF.<br /><br />By Mockingjay questions arise about a lot of crude plot developments and inconsistencies.  Like how many times is Katniss going to go to the brink of death and back.  Already lost count in CF but time to run the counter again in MJ.  Or Katniss and Coin having their little catfight even though it seems Katniss is treated well enough.  Also the whole make-up team from the capitol is getting a little tiresome by this point.  So is the District 13 helping with the war or just sending in the dream team with cameras?  Twice Katniss goes to districts and twice she is wounded but neither she nor Gale nor anybody else seem to care about the general welfare of the districts...only that they have to go after district 2 and crack the \\"nut\\" in order to go after Snow and the Capitol.  Meanwhile all we get to hear is how confused Katniss is and how bad her dreams are and all kinds of emotional baggage that while very descriptive is not helping with the plot development or promoting any interest within the reader.  Just stuff we already went through in books 1-2 ad-nausea.  This book should be the crown of the trilogy but since the author has used exclusive 1st person narrative and because the leading character is broken and confused then so are the readers.  Like many others there is no disagreement with the ending and the epilogue however the way the author arrives there is completely without sufficient reasoning and development.  Its like the author should have posted a notice halfway through the book stating that \\"suspended disbelief will be impossible for most readers beyond this point\\" and let us know that we should skip to the last two chapters and the Epilogue instead of going mad trying to reconcile the authors plot/character contrivances.<br /><br />Wish I could have liked Mockingjay but I could not. An ugly death of a promising trilogy.  1 sad star...
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect at first but I am truly surprised by how much I've come to enjoy this game. Quite challenging for how simplistic the game play is. It is very different than \\"Quell\\" but shares some of the same concept in play style and puzzle complexity. The best part is that the puzzles almost seem to be infinitely changing and never ending. Will last you awhile for game play with it's different modes and optional time frame completion challenge. Has great replay value due to the changing puzzle setups and increasing difficulty with different modes. Think it's too easy? Play out a dozen levels while trying for gold (quickest time) in challenge mode.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Catching Fire should really be titled Hunger Games II since Katniss and Peeta obediently march off to the Hunger Games a second time in two years like lambs to the slaughter.  It seems they didn't learn enough from their first hunger games and neither did the other victors.  Used in HG the hunger games were disturbing but compelling and fresh.  Used in CF it felt contrived and overused.  If you are looking for much character development you wont find it in this book and you CERTAINLY wont find it in Mockingjay (which is the saddest part).<br /><br />Anyway expectations were low for the 2nd book in a trilogy but even with the lowered expectations there could be no higher score than 3-Stars.<br /><br />Trilogy summary HG=5-stars, CF=3-stars, MJ=1-sad-star
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive. Hunting, fishing and filling up the land with all kinds of props is super fun.

0393338827|5.0|While living through this latest financial meltdown, I thought I understood the reasons why it all happened... then I read this book and really understood.  Mr Lewis comes to the subject with the financial background of having worked on Wall Street and the great ability of a story teller.  This is one of those stories where you know the ending, but you are completely compelled to read it anyway.<br /><br />The story of the these awful mortgages being bundled up and sold as if they were the highest of quality investment and the people who gambled for and against them is detailed out in a carefully researched manner.  I finished this book and just had a bad taste in my mouth for these brokers and what they created.  This is the sign of a great author, who can make you feel a certain way, change you thinking, illuminate hidden subjects.  I am so glad I read this book, now believing I truly understand the concepts and the lessons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o excellent story-telling<br />o great in-depth reporting<br />o makes complicated subjects understandable<br /><br />Cons:<br />o still a lot of jargon - but you need to understand it to tell the story<br /><br />Overall - I highly recommend this book.  It should be required reading in every college business program.
B005WKKI96|1.0|A big disappointment completely unrelated to the quality of the music. I received this CD from Amazon and I had to return it because the disc was neither recognized by my CD player nor by computer (a Mac). I got a replacement that, again, was not recognized by my stereo system although I could listen to it in my laptop. I think that CDs made with programs that can be recognized only by certain computer software should have a disclaimer telling so to the potential buyer.<br />I like Lila Downs a lot but not these low quality products sold using her name

B007Q476KU|1.0|This was an awful movie. The scenery was good in parts and made me want to live there. Why did the Black horse have to die? It seems to always happen that way. Why couldn't he have his friend come with him the whole way. That horse did not have to be killed off and to show all those dead horses. That is sick. What a bad taste of theme and drama. I know is horrible but you don't have to go around reiterating it. There are enough poor, trashy shows on now. Can't we have something good for once. It also follows a similar fate and story line as Black Beauty.
B005CMSDKA|4.0|If you thought this was a movie, you were disappointed.  The director's sole intention was to match surreal images to the Chemical Brothers soundtrack.  No money was wasted on the script.
B005URRCUY|4.0|I got this album for Christmas, and I've had it in my car's CD player spinning off and on when I need something other than talk radio.<br />I've enjoyed it, the songs are catchy with a bit of a southern vibe, and I find myself singing along with them.  I don't know if the comparison is a great one, but this album takes me back thinking of [[ASIN:B000VZIOCK Songs For The Deaf [Explicit]]].<br /><br />The only problem is that to me, the songs on this album are not different enough that there is a lone stand-out. I'm not sure if that's good or bad.  You can play it straight through and jam, but I can't even think of one off of the top of my head that I would put on to showcase the band to someone who hadn't heard of them yet.  However, just writing of them right now makes me want to go get the CD, so I'd say have a go at the Black Keys.
B006VC3LES|4.0|Very distressing to wait years for a beautiful classic like this to come to Blu-ray while horrid garbage is released all the time. The Blu-Ray conversion is lovely and rich, even though a few scenes seemed a bit grainy. As always with Blu-Ray the sound conversion adds a new dimension and in this case improves greatly on the original DVD release.<br /><br />The commentary by David Fincher and Robert Towne was a big disappointment. Fincher comes off as a smart-ass know it all and much of the discussion is centered around us never forgetting just how clever and 'in' he is. They both use industry jargon that they don't bother to explain. A way of reminding us that we are not quite as smart as they are.<br /><br />Well done and very much worth the bargain price of $18.99
B000FBFML6|3.0|It's not the worst book I've ever read by any means, but the whole book was essentially either a wind down from the previous book, or perhaps a wind up to the next one.  Unfortunately for me, it's essentially guaranteed to be the former, since I see very little reason to read anything else in this line of books.<br /><br />I was literally at 1/5th of the way through the book and felt like it should have picked up by then... then 2/5ths... still nothing... 3/5ths... still pretty much nothing... 4/5ths!  Suddenly a bit of activity and some promise!  Nope.  It fades away and the whole book kind of sputters to a close.<br /><br />I didn't put it down and stop reading it.  Like I say... it wasn't *bad*... it was just very dull.<br /><br />It also suffered from Fitz still essentially not growing up, and I think the whole thing with the fool was just as unecessary as the fool felt it was in the book.  Sort of an irony there.<br /><br />I had read the reviews but SO enjoyed the previous four books that I had hoped it was just someone being grouchy, but I'm afraid it wasn't.  I genuinely wished I had ended the series on Fool's Errand.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|great app! this app is a lot of fun and very challenging. it's really fantastic that appstore provides it for free.
B005DC68NI|5.0|A very informative, straight to the point look at the current state of the publishing industry and how the digital revolution has made it possible for talented writers to take charge of their own product. A resource not to be without.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just loved this book,  could not put down, excellent from start to finish can't wait to read the next 2 books.  Movie is really great as well.  But as always book is even better.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Wow, sounds good on paper but the games you can access are terrible! Then you have to put up with nothing but ads asking you to buy this and buy that. More effort was put into trying you to buy stuff over the actual crappy games.
B0027BOL4G|2.0|Understood, the movie documents super big food corps, and I'm in agreement that food manufacturing becoming huge business is  not good for the consumer or the animal food sources themselves.  In fact, \\"pretty-ing\\" up and fattening up our food sources has consequences that reaches us at the cellular level and can cause health problems.  Not to mention tampering with seeds has created a world where seeds must one day become less varied and must ultimately be bought rather than gathered, and that's scary in the biblical sense.<br /><br />That said, the average city folk that watches this may get the impression that all dairies, all ranches, all chicken farms etc treat their animals inhumanely, that all animal farms are corrupt.  The average busy person is not going to meditate on the fact that this may be a select few companies or that it's big business. In fact, are all food corps this corrupt?  I really don't know, b/c I don't see w/ my naked eye whether there are corp farms that do run ethically.  But I do know that coming from a farming town where dairies are a big business  here, that these dairies and their cows are in plain sight.  I drive by them daily, I see them daily.  Heck, I can just stop my car and walk up to the fence if I wanted to.  I talk w/ the dairyman, I've spoken w/ chicken farmers, I've seen their chickens, our kids go on fieldtrips to these farms and get educated.  And what I see are very clean cows, clean dirt, clean food, and farmers that care very much about their investments.  I've NEVER seen a sick or obese cow wandering around, they are taken care of immediately, b/c they're valuable to the farmers.  Each cow cost money, and healthy cows make money.<br /><br />Please keep your mind open and realize that is film is not granite and not total reality.  It's one filmmaker's perpective.  Just b/c it's on film doesn't mean it applies to the vast majority of farms.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|this memory fits the hp mini models 210 super well, I upgraded the laptop to windows 7 home and this is a must for that upgrade.
B000001FFR|5.0|I really like Fistful of Metal but Spreading the Disease is more memorable and the songwriting is slightly better. It's not as heavy as FOM and it's quite a bit more melodic, the band takes a new direction. They started as a speed metal band and sound like their music was influenced by NWOBHM bands. The American thrash metal scene started around the time and Anthrax were going that direction on STD. It mixes both of their early and late sounds, it's a great crossover thrash album. It's also their first album with Joey Belladonna on lead vocals, he replaced their former vocalist Neil Turbin.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|the game was great until it began to forceclose every time I accept gifts and it erased my neighbors... other than that I would rate it higher... would also be better if you could do other things to obtain gems
B000002UJQ|5.0|In a decade filled to overflowing with amazing music, the 90s gave us some truly memorable, amazing sonic experiences. This album is sublime, even for that magical decade. Every track is stunning, each conveying a different emotional response, yet all meshing together in the way that truly great albums always do. The difference between \\"let's make a cohesive album that all sounds like it belongs together\\" vs \\"just a bunch of songs we recorded\\" is readily apparent in albums like this.<br />Not only is this an \\"important\\" album, it's also simply a joy to listen to. Haunting, melodic, touching, uplifting, and harrowing in turns, it runs a full and rich gamut of emotions. It's also much more cohesive than Radiohead's more recent work, which is still amazing but suffers a bit from being unfocused. OK Computer, however, is a prime example of an incredibly talented band at the height of their powers, and deserves a place in the collection of anyone that loves music.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is a great pass time and I love to play it. I would really like to see more people playing it.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|*UPDATE 27 APR 2012*<br />Ok, the game has a lot of glitches that apparently effect the length of time things usually mature in the game.  This has happened on a couple occasions now.  The first time I was instructed to clear data, which I did.  The next time, I decided to restart my Kindle Fire a couple of times and that seemed to fix it fairly quickly so I continued playing.  This particular time, it's been a few days and everything is saying \\"Ready\\" but there is no money to collect, food is no longer growing, animals will no long produce food and when you click on them as well it simply says \\"Ready\\".  I'll likely delete the game soon and just be done with it.  Too many issues...  Which is sad cause it was one of my favorite to play.<br /><br />*UPDATE 09 Apr 2012*<br />I had an incident where I turned my Kindle Fire off for the night to charge.  The next day when I turned it back on, the games \\"times\\" were all messed up.  Items that usually take 20 minutes to happen, were now reading 89 Hours...  The Customer Service with Amazon simply suggested I \\"Clear Data\\" which erases all saved game playing time and you start from scratch.  This issue has actually happened twice.  So I'm not sure what this glitch is that lengthens the times but I hope it is resolved quickly.<br /><br />I remember playing this game as a child. It was much more simple but for the era it came out, it was the best thing since sliced bread. It's nice to find an updated reversion that's just as fun.
0756407125|2.0|The first book is one of my favorites, and I read it a couple times and recommended it to many.  After the first hundred pages of reading this book, I knew something was seriously wrong. The book was meandering and boring. I have never been so annoyed at a book before. Mostly because the first one was so great and I have been looking forward to the sequel for a long time.<br /><br />This is a very strange book in that it fails to advance any story set up in the previous book at all after 800 pages. Like others have said, nothing happens. Hundreds of pages are devoted to things no one cares about, and important events are glossed over.<br /><br />Many of the things that happen in the story just do not make sense.  The characters and plot are overly simplistic.  The turns of the plot are grating. I enjoyed the first book very much, but many of the things I loved are now incredibly annoying, including the talents of Kvothe, and his many cutesy conversations. Even the writing is wearing on me, because the lack of depth is glaring and seems more and more childish.<br /><br />Kvothe does not make sense as a character. For example, he complains constantly of his lack of money, yet when he develops an invention (arrowcatch) that can make him rich, he makes a point to sell it for a much smaller amount than possible and in fact, stops producing it. But no reason is given for these actions.<br /><br />Additionally, the plot is overly convenient; for example, when he discovers that he should take a break from the university, a life-changing opportuntity arises immediately in a far away land. And of course, he randomly runs into Denna there in the street, conveniently. Nothing of note happens with her, of course. And what purpose does she or any other female in this series have, but to show that the author lacks any sort of understanding of females at all. But the simplicity of characters extends beyond female relationships, and into everyone around Kvothe, who are either overlyjovial, despise him completely, or are in shock at his abilities. The characters, including Kvothe, are just obviously unrealistic.<br /><br />This is no \\"The Phantom Menace\\", and the author is a great writer. His prose is so smooth and comfortable, but like others have said, nothing ever happens, and the cutesy nature of the writing grows more and more annoying after hundreds of pages of random crap. I don't care if Kvothe receives a ha'penny or makes a girl cry when he plays his lute.<br /><br />In an interview, the author states that readers do not like the Fela part of the story because \\"fantasy readers are mental about having sex in their books. I swear, it's like they're 12 year old boys who still think girls are icky. And kissing them is extra icky.\\" I think the author is missing the point entirely and blaming his bad writing on the readers. Just sad, considering how unrealistic the interactions in the book are, revealing the amateurish understanding of the author himself. Additionally, no matter how good the prose of the author, he cannot trump basic, universal rules of storytelling.<br /><br />Regardless of whether this is what the author intended, it can't be considered a success, and displays the need for the author to force himself to make the story a priority instead of making Kvothe his personal, fantasy-world, superhero avatar endlessly lost in unconnected and unrealistic adventures/conversations that assault the intelligence of the reader.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the widget, has several different translations, quick and easy to use. great for daily devotions or longer readings or research
B00169N0BK|5.0|I purchased this because I want the best prints possible. I monitored my screens and made profiles for my papers. For comparison, I had a professional make me a custom profile for the two papers I use the most. When I loaded the profile I made with this machine and the one I had custom made I could not tell the difference.  It is easy to use. Follow the instructions carefully. I am hoping that Colormunki will have upgrades so you can use it when all the systems change. I owned a screen calibrator that worked fine, but when I upgraded my computer it was worthless.
B00000IREA|1.0|Simply put, this movie is a waste of time. It is self-indulgent sixties nonsense produced by movie-makers with too much hubris and not enough sense.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Usually in any type or length of series, the first book tends to be my favorite. It's the introduction of the characters, their lives, the \\"chase,\\" getting to know them the most. I am torn on which I enjoyed more, but there was definitely more action in this book than the first. I still looked around as I was reading (and blushing!) to make sure no one was watching my facial expressions. I have read them twice now and when I found out it was going to be a movie, I was ecstatic! I can't get enough of Christian and Ana!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Back to the old sound , excellent with Diamond Dave back in the band.<br />thanx god  Mr Hagar left .<br />Eddie never disappoints, and if somebody wants to compare to chickenfoot, is a fool.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read these books twice. I could not put them down the first time---read all 3 in under 6 days and I work full time and have 2 children in baseball. I typically do not write reviews on books I read, but it seems most reviews are 1 or 5 stars (love or hate) with little in between, so I figured I would put mine out there. I love the characters, I love the story, and I love the......other. When this book ended, I HAD to immediately start the second one. I could not get enough.
B00756GKBA|5.0|WOW....played it all the way through twice.  Awesome.  The United States and beyond must start to embrace its iconic stars/celebrities who have proven themselves as true entertainers over the years while they are still with us on the planet.  What's with this \\"for a woman her age\\", \\"she should stop at her age\\" mumbo jumbo??? If she were male, would these comments be made?  madonna is pop music.  She changed the world as it relates to pop music. She is an awesome entertainer both in concert and beyond.  This is a piece of work that represents some of her most personal lyrics to date. One of the best total package listens from start to finish.  Highly, highly recommended.  Can't wait to see her live in September.  I would suspect that anyone who likes to dance will understand MDNA.  If you aren't someone who likes to dance...perhaps this will get you going. M says it best in I'm Addicted....\\"I need to dance\\". BRAVO madonna for keeping us dancing and even walking to work with your happy, energized beats.  It's great to feel energized and HAPPY.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Another war book like the hundreds now available.  The stories are sad, particularly when our soldiers are killed or hurt.  But this one needs an editor to keep the story from jumping around.  Nice guy and a aalute to him for his service but he needs to stick to hyping his business somewhere other than in a book he is selling.  Save your money.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Buyer beware: I purchased Office Suite Pro for my tablet so I could work off-line -- novel concept for the software because it will not let me do anything IF it cannot find the nearest WiFi Internet connection.  What a complete waste of money and time.  It would have been nice to know this before I purchased the app.  Now I am hoping to find something else that is more user friendly and will enable me to work off-line because where I live WiFi is few and far between.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|Nice clean interface.  Love the way it shows you at a glance whether your time zones of interest are experiencing daylight, twilight or darkness.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I love, love LOVE this album. Highlights / My two favorites:<br /><br />Gang Bang: Verrry violent. It may be violent, but this beat is addictive and we all have those fantasies once in a great while where we just want to take out our aggression in some way. I do find myself shouting \\"Driiiive b****!!!!\\" while I am running errands, stuck in traffic. I could definitely see a Quentin Tarentino music video (or a twist, how about a Guy Ritchie-directed vid?) I already have it all played out in my head...<br /><br />Falling Free: Heartbreaking. I can sit there and listen to this song on repeat over and over. It may be my favorite Madonna ballad now, and it has only been available for a week now. It is simply the most beautiful and heartfelt song on the album, and other songs may have more clear lyrics but in this song you can feel her emotions through her tone and voice. I also have a wedding/divorce/funeral mirrored music video in my head for this one too. I wish.<br /><br />I also love Turn Up The Radio, I'm Addicted, Give Me All Your Luvin and I'm A Sinner. I do also want to note that while I do like \\"Love Spent\\" I am in love with acoustic version I received from my iTunes pre-order. Perfection! As for Masterpiece.. I do like it a lot, though now I find myself singing \\"If you had a piece of pizza, you'd be sitting in the loo...\\" instead.<br /><br />I could give or take \\"I Don't Give A\\" and \\"Superstar\\" and would have much rather had \\"B-Day Song\\" in all it's cheese and the familiar \\"Beautiful Killer\\" join the standard edition.<br /><br />Really a 4.5 out of 5, but considering the album gave me new instant favorites Gang Bang and Falling Free, I am willing to round up.
B0071BY1CO|5.0|I'm not writing this to bash the movie or the 3D.  This was an excellent movie and the 3D was amazing!  However, I bought this and the opening sequence, the 2D animated sequence, skips.  However, once it passes that sequence it plays fine.  I notice this on my LG blu-ray player.  I tried it in my PS3 and it played fine, no skipping!  Has anyone else had a problem like this with this movie or is it just me? If so, what did you do to fix it? Any suggestions?
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Easy read, but hard to stomach.  I guess I didn't need all the details of what happened, but I'm happy to know the money from the book is going to a good cause.

B004VMVTNU|2.0|Not as loud as when app was first introduced. Galaxy S2 Skyrocket. Ringer volume 100%<br />Volume overriding? Why would there be an in-app volume option if the app's volume can be controlled elsewhere?
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I drive an Audi TT roadster and need pretty loud volume to hear music above the wind noise at high speed.  This amp is wonderful - I play from my iPhone into the car stereo's input and wonderful things happened when I put the Fiio in between.  Without it, the car's speakers start to distort at high volumes.  With it, the sound stays crisp - even when I'm playing LOUD.  Sweet.  An absolute must have for people who listen to music with the top down!
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|The West Wing is my favorite show of all time. This one slides into #2. I don't follow many series or watch much TV, but I found this show captivating with a well laid out storyline. It's not going to challenge you intellectually, but it's also not WWE wrestling. It's a fun ride worth an opportunity.

0385535139|4.0|One thing that must be said for Grisham is that he's never afraid to try varied genres. From Painted House, to The Bleachers, to The Firm, Grisham stretches his wings hugely. I wasn't quite ready for The Litigators because most of his lawyer stuff carries the raw edge of suspense. This was basically a comedy with a few attempts at tension. Starring a law partnership called Finley & Figg, I almost felt like this was going to be Dickensian, but Grisham kept a firm foot in contemporary America. Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are slightly stereotypical, with Finley the tough old Scrooge who lurches around perpetually complaining and Figg the unethical ne'er do well with a line of divorces, always a step away from the booze.<br />By a freak accident, a well paid bottom dweller at a huge law firm goes on a drunk and ends up at Finley & Figg's, and, what do you know, this David Zinc decides he likes the small time. Always on the search for the one massive money case, Figg decides their fortune will be scored in suing a pharmaceutical firm for a heart med. Suddenly they're in way over their heads. Meanwhile, David gets involved in a few minor cases. One involves an immigrant family whose little boy gets lead poisoning from a pair of costume Nasty Teeth for vampires. As these three stooges stumble their way deeper and deeper into litigations, the reader wonders if they will possibly end up just commiting suicide as the easy way out. If you're looking for some light entertainment disguised as dark humor, pick up the book. Grisham has some fun with it.
0596007124|5.0|A fun read!  This is why started buying head-first books!  I'm also going to start searching by the authors for more of their work!  I had been programming for about 7 years and this book gave me some great new ideas.  Perfect book for teaching old dogs new tricks!
B00006AW63|1.0|I feel my title said it all. I purchased the movie (condition new) when I recieved it the case was broken. The disc looked fine. We tried to watch the movie and a message poped up saying the disc doesnt work in this regin. I have never heard of such a thing. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY
0553386794|2.0|The title of this review suffices.  It tells you what you need to know about George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones.<br /><br />Who likes a prude?  I don't, any more than you do, so I regret being one today, but I really did not enjoy this book.  If my reason interests you, then I will give it to you, after which you can make up your own mind.<br /><br />Why you read fiction is for you to say but, when I read it, I do not read it to revel in the bitter depths of human vice.  The first few pages of Mr. Martin's book hit you with -- well, I cannot write it.  I am not tough or cynical enough, I guess.  What Mr. Martin's pages hit you with is not mere fornication.  It's worse than that.  The book is R-rated.<br /><br />If you feel that Tolkien handles sexual deviancy with class and proper tact in his wicked characters Wormtongue and Ar-Pharazôn, if a more explict treatment does not interest you, then stay away from Mr. Martin's book.  If you judge Jane Austen to pose and describe veniality on the right level, then Mr. Martin is not for you.<br /><br />Mr. Martin does know how to spin a narrative, though.  I cannot deny that.  As far as I could bring myself to read it, his story is skilfully plotted, fast paced and well-told, considerably better in this respect than most of novels you will find on the science-fiction/fantasy shelf, even than the best-sellers.  His premise is thoughtfully imagined, as well.<br /><br />Anyway, you can make of my two-star rating of Mr. Martin's book what you will.  The rating is not really the review's purpose (though it does represent my personal, overall assessment).  Rather, the review's purpose is to warn you what you're buying, before you buy it.  If my objections do not interest you, but my praise does, then you will probably like this book.  For my part, I have returned my copy for a refund and do not mean to buy a George R. R. Martin book again.<br /><br />I wish that Mr. Martin were interested in writing clean prose, because he is an uncommonly skilful storyteller.  However, Mr. Martin could hardly make it clearer that the writing of G-rated prose does not interest him.  The reading of R-rated prose does not especially interest me.  Thus do our ways part.an uncommonly skilful storyteller.  However, Mr. Martin could hardly make it clearer that the writing of G-rated prose does not interest him.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|I resisted Dexter forever as \\"not my kind<br />of thing.\\" My 42 year old son, who has a catholic appetite for all things media-related, bought me the first three seasons on DVD so I HAD to watch. And I am hooked. Quirky creative premise. Good writing. Excellent cast with a different shining guest star each season. I can't get enough of this show!
B00729GQ0A|1.0|I barely finished it and even that just because i was curious as to why on earth it got 5 stars.<br />the tempo was odd,mainly far too SLOW.<br />the characters...i didn't connect to then at all.<br />I didn't find them very interesting either and the ending...major anticlimax.<br />Mainly though the whole world seemed off,I just didn't connect to any of it.<br />one of the worst I've read.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I work over in Bagram Afghanistan, the PS3 controllers that they sell on base are expensive ($75), they justify the price by packaging a inexpensive HDMI cable with the unit. Since I was not in a hurry to have the unit. I did a price comparison on several sites and quickly found this unit on Amazon for nearly half the price. A lot closer to the actual retail price. Once I ordered the unit I received my Play Station 3 Dual Shock 3 controller within a couple of weeks.
B00784Y29G|1.0|There are NO ANNOTATIONS - I wish Amazon would clean up its act and start posting accurate descriptions especially on the works of Shakespeare.  WHERE ARE FOOTNOTED/ANNOTATED EDITIONS OF SHAKESPEARE FOR THE KINDLE??
B005URRCUY|5.0|With the advent of techno-dance music that is sweeping the world it is refreshing to hear a very almost gritty rock album that really delivers.  I don't want to say unrefined, but the guitar sounds like it was miked in your buddy's basement -- straight from the amp with no post processing.  Unrefined in a good way.  The Black Keys just have captured this great sound that just sounds more real than most.<br /><br />For anyone who doesn't like the Black Key's because they've 'made it' and they say 'everyone' is listening to them, it's your loss.<br /><br />One last thought, great album overall. All tracks are well done.
B007DIQB50|5.0|So i patiently awaited for my nicki cd to arrive today, and as soon as it did i devoured it up... What i found was the first half of the album was pretty decent hip hop tracks while the second half was straight up dance music, while i feel like roman in moscow should have been added to make the album feel complete, i was very satisfied with the album in whole and haters are gonna hate no matter what, so if u a nicki fan u will love it, if ur not a fan then simply dont buy it.
0393317552|3.0|As mentioned in the title this is a good textbook but not quite a bedtime story.<br /><br />This book was required reading for my geography class, and for AP World History in HS.  The main theme -- Yali's question -- is very thought provoking but the themes become redundant halfway through the book.<br /><br />3 Stars.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I bought the Game of Thrones for my husband. I wasn't familiar with the books and hadn't seen the show when it aired. The sets, costumes, etc. are top-notch but I was very impressed with the character complexity and epic scale throughout. I went out and bought all the current books in the series. Season one follows book one pretty much word-for-word, what a treat for a small screen adaptation not to be all chopped up. For those of us without HBO you can jump right into book two without missing a beat while waiting for the next season's blu-ray release. Highly recommended!
0307887898|5.0|This is a must read for any entrepreneur!<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything but if you are involved in anyway with a startup, know somebody who is working at a startup, considering going into business, etc this book can be a great resource.<br /><br />Loads of valuable information.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Sound and picture quality are excellent. Lots of extras. Personally I am a junkie when it comes to behind the scenes documentaries and footage so more is always better, and while it had a lot, I wish it had a few more hours worth. Overall love this show, the Blu Ray set and glad I bought it. First Blu Ray I bought too btw
0887307280|4.0|OK so you may think that even though this book was published in 1995 that it is no longer current.<br /><br />Even though your top-of-the-line smartphone is obsolete in 2-weeks there are some things that stay current and that's how this book is written.  If you are reading [[ASIN:0307887898 The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses]] or [[ASIN:0307408930 The Wall Street Journal. Complete Small Business Guidebook]] this book will complement if perfectly.<br /><br />I'm not going to give away any spoilers but if you have any interest in business this book is great.
B007DIQB50|1.0|I like Nicki. I believe she has a lot of potential. She has the voice, but her lyrics...make her sound like...a \\"stupid hoe\\".<br />Her first album was impressive. It was HER story: her career, love, and just life.<br />This album is just a DISS album. Rapping about your haters through out the CD is definitely a bad idea. She has to be better than that. I seriously don't care about the beef she has with Lil' Kim or anyone else. One song about how haters bring you down, okay, I can deal with it. But not like this! She's become a hater herself!

0439023521|5.0|Every year, twenty-four teenage \\"tributes\\" are brought to the Capitol of Panem, and sent out into the arena to kill each other on live TV. Only one will survive.<br /><br />This chilling premise is at the center of \\"The Hunter Games,\\" the brilliant, powerful first book of Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy. It's a slow-burning, brutal, chilling thriller twined with some barbed satire (reality TV!) and an oppressive government -- but at heart, it's an uplifting story about a young woman fighting to be free.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen lives in the impoverished District 12, hunting food to provide for her mother and her beloved little sister Prim. But on the day of the reaping, Prim is selected. And Katniss does something no one else has done in a long time -- she volunteers to go instead. Along with the male tribute, Peeta Mellark -- a boy who once helped her at her lowest point -- she is swept away to the Capitol.<br /><br />Once there, the tributes are pampered, tutored, styled and turned into celebrities -- until they're released into the arena, and start killing each other to survive. Katniss must evade murderous gangs, traps, and genetically engineered beasts.<br /><br />But after their triumphant first appearance at the Capitol, the audience has taken a shine to the impoverished young \\"lovers\\" and are rooting for them to triumph. But if both Katniss and Peeta are to survive, they must learn how to play the game that the gamemakers and polticians are playing -- and use the Hunger Games against them.<br /><br />A lot has been made of \\"The Hunger Games'\\" resemblance to the Japanese franchise \\"Battle Royale,\\" but honestly the only real similarity is the core concept. Suzanne Collins' world is a far stranger place, set in a futuristic North America where rebellion is brewing against a tyrant. And it seems more to be a barbed, glass-sharp satire on reality TV and how easily people are swayed, either for evil or good.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' writing style here takes a little getting used to -- she not only writes everything in the first person, but in the present tense. It's.... a little strange, and it takes some getting used to.<br /><br />But once you do get used to the odd style, Collins' writing is on fire. She writes in an intense, slow-burning style that is speckled with bittersweet scenes (Katniss singing to Rue) and colorful descriptions (the superficial, sparkly Capitol). But it's also brutally violent at times, with various teens being killed in some truly gruesome ways (broken neck, countless stings, arrows) -- and though Collins doesn't go into graphic detail, it's still pretty shocking.<br /><br />But at heart, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is about one young woman's struggle. Katniss is a struly striking heroine -- she's strong, tough and fiery, as you'd expect of a girl who has been supporting her family, but she has the right amount of vulnerability and kindness. Peeta is a very sweet, sensitive love interest who complements her perfectly, and there's a strong round of supporting characters -- the clever stylist Cinna, the drunken ex-tribute Haymitch, the birdlike Rue, and many others.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is one of those rare books that strikes a deep chord in people's souls -- and it's a beautifully (if oddly) written story with a brilliant heroine.

B006Z21ZEM|3.0|The boys are getting older, and that's perfectly okay. But it's showing up in they way they perform. Bruce's lines get mixed up in Where The Wild Wind Blows, and the performances of the new songs are differently paced (he sings them slightly different, which is a real disappointment on The Talisman) and the energy just isn't there. The opening track of 'The Final Frontier' sounds like they are completely exhausted, and it's the first song! Their classics sound fine, for the obvious reason that they play them all the time. I was really hoping for a killer, epic performance of the new material - but it's just not there.<br /><br />I love every Maiden album that comes out, and I am always thankful for it. But this one just doesn't hold up to the energy of the previous live albums. With that being said, I still bought it, I still love it, and every Maiden fan should own it.

1451683405|5.0|The real question is not if free will exists, i am certainly inclined to think it does not. The real question is how the structure of our universe came to evolve in such a way where there would be some kind of entity, us human, funneling and coalescing an unbelievable quantity of sub-atomic particles into a conscious being thinking about this question? I love Sam Harris to make me think about this. Thank you.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I could hardly put this book down and never once had the thought, 'when will it end'. When I was done reading it I wished there was another book after this one.<br /><br />The characters all play an important role in the story and they are never boring.<br /><br />All 3 books are good but this and the second are by far the better of the 3.
0062014102|5.0|Plain and simple, yeah it's a pretty awesome book. Talks a lot of science, with math, physics, and of course the cosmos, but it also talks about other cool aspects such as lucid dreaming and so on. It's a great read for people that are interested, and it might just bring you deeper down the rabbit hole. I mean, look..do I believe that the world is just a hologram being projected from our minds? No, not really. I look at it as this cool, fun and this new way to wonder at the possibility of these things. This book isn't going to \\"answer\\" all your questions, but for some it will. And others just leave you to ponder your way to a conclusion you think is right. I read it because the backbone to this story (aka the title) is itself super trippy! So, maybe if you aren't as lured into it, perhaps it isn't for you.

B0038VPB5W|5.0|I believe both of their other albums have better songs, like Tears Don't Fall and Waking the Demon. But their first two also contain some of their worst songs, Disappear and Spit You Out. I believe this is a very solid album with very consistent quality. It doesn't have as many highs and lows as The Poison and Scream Aim Fire. Its a album that flows nicely and is easy to listen to all the way through. I would recommend Alone, Your Betrayal, and Pretty on the Outside.
055357342X|1.0|Reading this series is such a waste of time.  By the time I got to book 4, because I was hoping so much that the books would get better, that progress would be made.  However, no progress is made in this book.  It was just a waste of time.  There is no REAL plot in this series.  I am very surprised by the so many who like this series.  It SUCKS!!!!  I would rave a bit more, but I feel that this book wasted so much of my time, and I don't feel like wasting any more time with it.  If the HBO series is exactly like the book series, I won't even bother watching the show.  It's pointless.  All the main characters die, there is no progress with kaleesi and her dragons.  We don't get to see Arya's wolf again.  It's all just a waste of time.  With none of the characters getting anywhere.

1469984202|5.0|Like so many others this is my first Amazon review and also like so many others 5 stars. This book was really amazing for several reasons. I think the foremost is that book is incredibly \\"organic\\" i don't think that there is a force scene, character, or moment in the entire series everything that happens seems a logical consequence of the setting and the characters. Secondly none of the characters are really \\"fiction-evil\\" there is tons of conflict, sometimes bloody. But i don't think there is a single character who would not say that his/her actions were not in the best interest of everyone. The author does a fantastic job of making everyone understandable. After all who really knows or cares what motivates a Sauron or Cthulu? They are just are things for the heros to oppose. Here everyone is just human and fallible. Lastly the author is a great example of the \\"show it\\" \\"don't say it\\" school. No jarring walls-of-exposition, the world of the book is revealed naturally through the characters and what they do.

B000E41MRC|4.0|Leni Riefenstahl (1902-2003) began her career as a dancer, progressed to film roles, and ultimately moved into cinematography, editing, and directing.  Adolph Hiter was among her many fans, and although she herself was never a member of the Nazi party, Hitler asked her create a film about it.  Titled VICTORY OF THE FAITH, the 1933 film included significant footage of Ernst Rohm, and when he fell out of favor and was executed the film more or less died with him.  Only one copy survived, and it is rarely seen; even so, it developed the foundation for Riefenstahl's next film, a depiction of the 1934 Nazi Congress in Nuremberg. It was titled TRIUMPH OF THE WILL.<br /><br />Many records perished during World War II, and those pertaining to TRIUMPH OF THE WILL are not excepted.  Although she would later deny that the project was pre-planned in any real sense, Riefenstahl's crew consisted of 172 people, a number that could hardly be managed without considerable advance thought.  It also appears that Riefenstahl went to Nuremberg to have camera tracks and boom shot devices installed in strategic locations long before Hitler arrived.  Reifenstahl also deployed as many as thirty cameras from scene to scene, most them apparently predetermined positions, and one or two scenes have the sense of being actively directed.  Hitler and his entourage were certainly well aware that they were being filmed--and at times repeated portions of their speeches for the sake of a better camera shot. The organizers of the congress were instruced to be as camera-friendly as possible and even went so far as to dig ditches to allow Riefenstahl to get the shots she wanted.  Over the course of about four days, Riefenstahl and her crew shot an incredible sixty-plus hours of film.  Riefenstahl herself edited the film to a run time of two hours; even at this length, historians estimate that THE TRIUMPH OF THE WILL presents film footage showing about thirty thousand people.<br /><br />In later years, Riefenstahl stated that Hilter had asked to make the film because she was apolitical and he wanted a film that would appeal to just such people.  He did not, Riefenstahl said, want a political film--and the film that she delivered is notable for that fact.  Ironically, the very absence of Nazi politics and policy makes them even more obvious than they might have been if they had been included, but Riefenstahl's emphasis is on imagery: impossibly large crowds, masses of flags, endless arrays of torches, incredible bits of scaffolding and rows of standard bearers.  TRIUMPH OF THE WILL is visually staggering to the same degree as such films as INTOLERANCE and THE BATTLE SHIP POTEMKIN.  Her editing is a grand affair, with exceptional tempo; her black and white imagery is extraordinary; her eye is indeed a great one, and although she made less than a dozen films, TRIUMPH OF THE WILL gained Riefenstahl the reputation as one of the greatest film artists of the 20th Century.<br /><br />There is a notion that TRIUMPH OF THE WILL received universal critical acclaim when it opened in 1935.  That is not entirely true.  The film was a great success in Germany, won awards in Paris, and dazzled producers in Hollywood, but it received mixed reviews.  Most were impressed with the imagery and cinematography and editing, but some found the structure commonplace.  And of course, by 1935 the nature of Nazi Germany had become increasingly apparent around the world, and a good many people condemned the film for its visual glorification of the Nazi party.  And these criticisms have continued to this day, and I have to agree that the entire look of the film is essentially a flowering of fascist art.<br /><br />Even so, there is an irony to TRIUMPH OF THE WILL that not even Riefenstahl could have imagined: we know what will happen to these people who parade in the streets, who cheer and wave and dance and parade.  I was repeatedly caught by the young children who smiled and laughed.  How many of them, I wondered, lived?  They danced, many of them willingly, right into the mouth of hell with Adolph Hitler leading the way.  Seen at this level, and balanced against later documentaries such the shocking Army Signal Corps footage of the concentration camps and such feature films such as the 1979 KITTY: RETURN TO AUSCHWITZ--my God, but it is disturbing, deeply disturbing and incredibly sad.<br /><br />There are a great many DVD releases of TRIUMPH OF THE WILL.  This review is of the \\"Special Edition\\" by Synapse Films, and includes a commentary by Dr. Anthony R. Santoro, which I found very erudite but perhaps somewhat dry.  It also includes a short Riefenstahl film, DAY OF FREEDOM, made to placate members of the military who felt TRIUMPH OF THE WILL had given then short shift; it too is remarkable for its imagery.  The elements have not been restored in a major sense, certainly not a digital sense, but the film is sharp enough for us to see the sweat on Hitler's brow, and the sound is quite good.  It is hard to recommend such film, but at the same time I feel everyone should see it at least once.  Evil wears a mask, and very often it is one of remarkable grace.  It is best to know that.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br />for Nicky, faithful feline companion for a decade, gone before his timef them, I wondered, lived?

B0058VW36U|5.0|Its a really nice game. Difficult too. keeps you occupied for hours on end very addicting. Honesty I couldn't stop playing it my kindle fire's battery was dead. And I just finished charging it!
0061053147|3.0|For fanbois only<br />While there's a lot of detailed information, it's poorly organized, rambling and repetitive. Oddly, many of the repeated anecdotes contradict each other in important details.<br /><br />Additionally, the author's many tics and affectations can be distracting; even annoying. Words and phrases are misused leading to confusion, stories trail off without conclusion or any apparent point, chapter/section heads are ignored and the topic of the head is never discussed in the text below it. The book could --and probably should-- have been edited to half its length without losing a single story or detail.<br /><br />The book also adopts a very literal reading of the film, and lacks insight into its meaning, context, or place in film history. It also takes a firm position on the \\"controversy\\" of whether or not Deckard is a replicant; entirely missing the point of the film, in my view.<br /><br />All these things make the book difficult and frustrating for the reader. But if that reader wants anecdotes and trivia about the making of 'Blade Runner' badly enough to wade through all the muck, the goods are in there. Somewhere.

B001EN71DG|3.0|I bought this Star Wars Original Trilogy set (which had the theatrical versions as a bonus disk) in 2006 at regular prices. Today Amazon is selling this set used at $93.99 + $3. And new the cheapest available price is $209.50 + $3!<br /><br />You should know that on my 50 inch TV the theatrical version does not fill the screen from side to side. This is because the DVD image is in a very old format (it is not anamorphic). So, I need to zoom the image to get the picture to fill the screen. This expands the film grain and dirt (which wasn't cleaned up very well on this release). Bottom line; on my large TV, these movies don't look very good.<br /><br />Are the theatrical versions worth it at these prices? It depends how badly you want it. This is the only original theatrical version of the 1977-1983 Star Wars trilogy released on DVD.

B003CYKCHW|2.0|I purchases this to use as a mouse for general use and the occasional starcraft 2. The mouse feels great and tracks well, but seems to subtly misbehave in conjunction with my Mac running OS X 10.7.3. When the mouse is plugged in, items behave as if I am dragging a depressed mouse cursor over them. Similarly, edge scrolling doesn't work in games. This persists until I hit the mode button. Then, eventually it starts up again. Its very frustrating when the mouse itself feels great in hand.
B0072OFOM6|3.0|Season 2 of Spartacus ( Vengeance ) was a good season. It wasn't perfect by any means. I felt a big part of this had to do with bringing Lucretia ( Lucy Lawless) back from season one ( Blood & Sand ) Her arc, along with lllithia; and Ashur ( The AWESOME Nick Tarabay )made this series feel like you was watching an episode of DAYS OF OUR LIVES. Seriously, do we need a soap opera in a show like this ? NO !  What season 2 got right was killing off six major characters in the season finale. Of course, I would've kept Ashur and Oenomaus for season 3.<br /> Another issue I have about this season, is plot lines that were introduced, and never followed up on. For example, in episode two, we are introduced to Nasir, a body slave, who is freed by Spartacus. Later durning that episode, Nasir is approached by Agron ( Our resident, Angry, and buff gladiator.) What these two have in common is, both of them have brothers...correction...Agron's brother ( Duro ) gave his life to save Agron durning the season 1 finale of Blood & sand. Durning their conversation, Nasir states that \\"I recall a brother\\". after Agron asked him, \\"Do you have family there ?\\" Referring to the Ludus which Spartacus and company escaped from. The only other Syrian was Ashur. This was a perfect opportunity for the writers...namely the show's creator ( Steven Deknight ) to link both Nasir and Ashur together. Deknight recently commented, that, Ashur and Nasir was never meant to be brothers. So why introduce that \\"brother\\" plot in there to begin with ?<br />It's things like this that makes the series unbalance. You see great potentional fro the characters, and some of their stories are over before they've even begun. One storyline that raised some eyebrows and broke many women's heart was the relationship between Nasir and Agron. Yes, the tough, hardened gladiator actually smacked a big wet kiss on a surprised ( but happy ) Nasir in episode 5 of the series...confessing his love for the former body slave.<br />If there is one thing the series doesn't shy away from, is sex. There is plenty galore in this series, sometimes between two women, or two men, or lets just make it an orgy. There is also plenty of gore, so...if you don't like seeing blood, this definately isn't the series for you.<br />The biggest hurdle this series had to over come, was the recasting of the title character. ( After Andy Whitfield's untimely death ) I think Liam Mcintyre, stepped up to the plate, and delivered his own take on the character. He is not as intense as Andy's protrayal...infact...one of Liam's problems ( which really isn't a problem ) is that he is a pretty boy. He puts some ladies on the show to shame really. He's also not as buff/ ripped as Andy. He does make the role his own though, so that is a good thing.<br />Hopefully Season 3 ( which begins JAN 2013) Will surpass season 2. Out of 5 stars, I would have to give vengeance a 3 1/2 for continuing the series and effort.

0062124293|4.0|I loved reading this book. It's an easy fun read and so relatable. Her story is basically about how she discovered what being a woman really means. It's not about growing breast, it's not about getting a boyfriend, or any of those things. It's a really very graphic personal story about how this lady just grew up and figured it out for herself. I could relate to a lot of it now that I'm a little older. I don't know if admitting to a crush on Chevy Chase was a good idea, but hey everybody's got their thing. Some of the stories were a bit too personal, not disgusting, but something I wouldn't exactly want to tell people. It's still one of the best books I've read in a long time and I've recommended it to everyone I know and I'm recommending it to you. Definitely get this book.
0345803485|4.0|I have to object to all of the pilling on criticism of this novel.  To me, this novel is about redemption and the power of love wrapped into a fairy tale  The hero is severally flawed, and yet it is the power of the innocence and love of the heroine that offers him true redemption from the pain of his past to finally know and understand love. For most women, the idea of \\"saving\\" a \\"tormented\\" man with her love is a strong ideal and this book plays to that ideal. Healthy or not - it is a concept that most women understand and at one point or another have been in such a relationship and failed, or dreamed of succeeding. I like that they both free each other sexually and use that freedom to move their relationship forward.  The term \\"mommy porn\\" has been associated with this novel and I have to ask why? Because a sexual scene is written as it might occur and not fade to black or waves crashing? I like that many mainstream people are learning about the different shades of BDSM, and in many ways find it interesting.  Perhaps it will help folks to be more open in their sexuality.<br /><br />Considering this book was written as fan fiction - and not as a contender for the Pulitzer - must also be taken into consideration.  It's a romance novel - or chick lit - and hence doesn't pretend to be anything more.  I thought the character of Christine Grey was intensely compelling and more fully written than Anastasia.  Christian's complicated start in life and its subsequent neurosis play out in his relationships with women. We want to know more about Christian - what has made him the way he is? How did he survive and what have been the costs of his survival?  Why does Anastasia call to him so strongly?<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down and I waited anxiously for the next installments. I liked Anastasia's \\"inner goddess\\" comments and her straightforward manner in dealing with Christian.  I had never read or seen Twilight, so for me I can't imagine any similarities or differences.  I thought the author's use of music to help explain some of the unspoken turmoils or delights was great.<br /><br />So I would suggest continuing to read about Christian and Ana and enjoy the ride!!

B00005JLEU|4.0|This movie is another one of Miyazaki's work that's entertaining and very interesting, to say the least.  You can't possibly expect what's going to happen next and even the ending is a little different than you would think.  It's semi-scary for small children who might fear odd looking spirits/ghosts or find the idea of their parents turning into pigs with a possibility of being eaten somewhat disconcerting. The story follows Chihiro who learns to deal with her issues, shows that a lack of material greed can be quite beneficial, and who quickly builds the courage to save her parents.  This movie has the sweet flavor of a plot with good purpose.

1439170916|5.0|My father suffers from advanced prostate cancer and I was looking for a book that would explain to me what a cancer is - with sufficient depth but not really jump out of the realms of knowledge of a lay person. This is where this books fills in the void. This book cuts through large spans of history and tomes of scientific literature to provide a unique perspective on the subject.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|I have to give credit where credit it is due and that certainly goes to Director Nicolas Winding Refn.<br /><br />  Nicolas Winding Refn makes the most of ever dollar in this exceedingly tight budget film. I was not familiar with this director nor even the actors, except for maybe one Ryan Gosling film I saw years ago (The Notebook). The simple plot intrigued me not to mention I am biased for lone wolf characters. Nicolas takes us on a personable journey through Los Angeles with the aid of a reticent and introverted Driver. (Ryan Gosling) He is a man who abides by a simple code; he gives you 5 minutes flat, and he doesn't carry a weapon. In those 5 minutes he is yours and yours only, but outside of that, you are on your own. Viewers will be given his sense of style from the very opening scene. He manages to stay calm and collective while avoiding potential danger at every turn. He can handle the road; he can handle a car; he can also handle pop music all too well. He is also a stunt driver for Hollywood films and a very good mechanic too. Imagine that.<br /><br />  The driver is good at what he does, at least in so far as driving is concerned, but when it comes to fulfilling an emotional emptiness in his life, he drives to the wrong exit. In his desolate apartment complex we are introduced to the driver's neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son. The driver befriends this family after her car breaks down not to far away from the auto body shop he works at. The driver's voluble manager, Shannon, (Bryan Cranston) offers a ride to Irene and persists that the driver will get her home safe. Quickly enough, the driver confides with Irene and her son and frequently spends time with them. Not surprisingly, a deeper connection ensues. It is not until Irene's husband returns from prison that we feel the emotional tension intensify from a V6 engine to a V8, but never diving below that V6 feel. The driver's love for this family does not abate but only grows when the husbandis beaten badly in the garage of the apartment complex. He owes protection money to the mob. It is here that the Driver breaks his code and helps Irene's husband. Unintentionally, he also familiarizes himself more than he would like with local mobsters such as Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman).<br /><br />Drive is incredibly well paced and I tend to disagree with all the surrounding clamor that it is slow in the beginning. This is far from the truth. I feel Nicolas was very much in control in how he maintained such a consistent feel of uneasiness throughout the film. He knew exactly when to take it up a notch and smoothly level it down to tame his audience gently. I thought the relationships were plausible enough to service the simple plot and add substance too. I'm not so sure what kind of a connection some critics were looking for but I felt the interactions were realistic. The chemistry was satisfying overall. Ryan Gosling's character was not very multi dimensional and it didn't need to be. He is a loner, plain and simple; no family, no friends and maybe a few enemies ? Ultimately, he is very mysterious but also very explosive, especially when it comes to protecting his neighbor. He is entertaining to watch. The rest of the cast is also serviceable; Albert Brooks pulls of an unapologetic mobster role as well as Ron Perlman. The style and presentation is quite unique. Moreover, the car chases are brilliantly choreographed to perfection; sounds and colors are pleasing to the eyes and ears and the violence is appropriately delivered. Nicolas reignites a once dominate American auto industry in the way he presents these distasteful and bulky hunks of metal; Ford and Chrysler should pay Nicolas royalties for making their cars look so darn good.<br /><br />I never overlook a film's score and in this particular case, Cliff Martinez scores a masterpiece from start to finish. Martinez weaves together an electronic 80's pop soundtrack that dominates the opening and ending scenes and adds his own personal and eery flare that is so central to Ryan Gosling's character. He enhances the desolation that is so prevalent in the Los Angeles landscape. The Driver's internal feelings are remarkably correlated to every vibrating moan that is released from Martinez's dominate usage of the synthesizer.  The subtle but eery sounds create a quite atmosphere of curiosity and danger in this beautiful and highly stylized film.
B006PTZNSY|2.0|The first eight or nine tracks were pretty decent, but then she spends the rest of the album singing. I mean, I like Nicki's rap. Her voice isn't terrible, but this isn't what I wanted. It sounds more like a discotheque album than a rap album. If anything, it shouldn't have been released in a two disc edition. I don't know, it was okay, but I won't be spinning it often.
B00138KE5Y|4.0|I've heard a lot of people mentioning that Barbara is over the hill but I like her and always enjoy listening to her \\"dated\\" albums...With that said...This has to be one of her best albums.Surprisingly the album is in excellent shape and the duets are exceptional...Thank you...

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I must say, I'm an AKG believer now! An amplifier is not necessary, but it will add so much more to the enjoyment of these headphones. I let a friend listen to these with just the Iphone and he was impressed. And then I let him listen with an added amplifier and he just started laughing. He just looked at me and said, \\"I want those.\\" I'd say this is a great buy for the beginner headphone audiophile. Headphones can become serious business as the price and quality increases, but for most people price stipulates the range of headphones available and these are great for their price of around $100. I have no doubts the AKG brand gets better from here.<br /><br />These are semi-open and people sitting near you can hear the sound. So these are better for home listening or in a park or environment where people will not become distracted or annoyed by the sound. These are not very appropriate for a library environment.<br /><br />Try plugging these into your Iphone and then plug them into your laptop and just gasp at the difference the power makes.<br /><br />I'd say get these and don't look back.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Pretty good game set. A little heavy on the advertisements but I'm enjoying the content so far. Id recommend it to anyone for a fun break from angry birds or cutbthe rope.
B006IDG2T6|4.0|As short of a book as it is, I think it was actually too long. While I agree with Harris's conclusion, I don't think he laid out the case very well. There are many parts of the book that are awesome, but he needlessly complicates an issue that is already complicated as it is.    Still, the book does contain many great gems. Here are just a couple of examples:  \\"Human choice, therefore, is as important as fanciers of free will believe. But the next choice you make will come out of the darkness of prior causes that you, the conscious witness of your experience, did not bring into being.\\"    \\"You can do what you decide to do--but you cannot decide what you decide to do.\\"    Over all, I think Sam Harris's `Free Will' is worth the read. Even though it could have been shorter, it is still pretty short and won't take up too much of your time. But it will consume your thoughts and get you thinking about your thinking.  -Staks Rosch [...]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|incredibly awesome with wonderful games entering. for hours<br />cant put it down.I played it so much I went from full batery to dead that much fun
0345529057|4.0|I picked up this series because I wanted to escape into an epic, and I certainly did. I was not prepared for how dark this series is overall - I wanted so many of the characters to succeed and was disappointed each time some awful thing happened to them. Aside from that, the books are well written, deliberately paced, and compelling. No happy endings here, but if you are in the mood for an epic that makes you care enough about the characters to be upset when they fail, this series is it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well its fun until you have to play the same game over and iver to get enough coins. then you get to unlock one and do it all over again
B006ZZC3D6|4.0|This game makes your brain think one step ahead-if you really want to beat the level you're on! It's fun though. Glad I came across it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't even know about this until my daughter told me about it, and then the movie came out as well.  I couldn't put it down and am already on the second book and can't put that one down either.  I will be buying the last one as well.  Great reading, makes you feel like you are there with the characters at every step they make.  I really enjoyed reading this one!!

B003EYVXV4|4.0|In a totalitarian future, twenty-four young people from twelve downtrodden districts are selected to battle to the death in a technologically controlled forest environment while being watched on nation-wide television.  When a young woman (Jennifer Lawrence) from a mining district volunteers in order to spare her younger sister (Willow Shields), she and her fellow \\"tribute\\" from the same district (Josh Hutcherson) play the game as it has never been played before.<br /><br />Lawrence has deservedly received much praise for her portrayal of Katniss, tough as nails yet vulnerable underneath.  The film is a bit too long and lags a bit in the forest scenes when it should really be picking up steam, but ultimately emerges as very entertaining and worthy of sequels.  I have not read the books, so I am looking forward to the next developments for Katniss, Peeta, and Gale (Liam Hemsworth, who will no doubt have more to do in future films).  Director Gary Ross's shaky camerawork drove me crazy in the film's early portions, but thankfully it was only used to heighten the sense of gritty realism in scenes set in Katniss's home district, so it went away once the characters moved to the Capital.  I don't remember whether it returned during the forest combat scenes, which means either that it didn't or that I was too engrossed by the story at that point to notice (entirely possible).<br /><br />If you enjoyed this film, you should check out \\"Battle Royale,\\" a Japanese movie with nearly the same premise made more than a decade ago.  \\"Hunger Games\\" has more heart, but its Asian equivalent is leaner, meaner, funnier (in a very dark way), and more wicked as a social satire.  It's also a lot bloodier, so know that going in.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is great out is on my fire as well as my phone I play it like forever it is awesome
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Powerful film.  I feel that everyone regardless of sex or marital status, with or without children can get something from the messages within the film.<br /><br />Yes, the movie does have a \\"religious\\" undertone, but that is to be expected.  This is another Sherwood film - they have yet to disappoint me.<br /><br />I appreciate that they cast and use many of their own members for the films.  Some of the acting is spotty, but it doesn't take away from the film.<br /><br />Great gift for father's day.  Wonderful initative for a church family to begin this summer.<br /><br />Overall, entertaining and enjoyable.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very smooth action and excellent resolution.  Somewhat different placement of suit stack.  Nice auto-complete.<br />Had to add six more words.
B006ON41FC|5.0|going nuts is awesome! I love the way you get floating nuts. if you are reading this you should get it.
B001JV5B12|5.0|I love this series.  It's on TV several times a year (I think the Syfy channel), but it's really worth owning it to see it uncut all the way through.  If you buy all three titles in the series, be sure to watch \\"Rise of the Lycans\\" first.  Even though it was produced third, it's actually a prequel to the first two movies.  Can't wait 'til the fourth one becomes available for purchase...didn't get to see it at the theater.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It's a fun and exciting game! You should get this fun game if u like Mario then you'll love this!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This collection of novellas is superb - highest recommendations. For what it's worth, my sci-fi author benchmarks are Orson Scott Card, John Scalzi, William Gibson, and Neal Stephenson. Hugh Howey is closer to John Scalzi than Gibson and Stephenson for density of language and speed of the read, but that's in no way any kind of diss - this stuff is terrific and utterly compulsive. It's a great, fun, fast read (I devoured this over a return flight to China) and found it absolutely satisfying. Publishers, why aren't you fighting each other to sign Mr. Howey? Hollywood, why are you not immediately optioning this story for screenplay conversion? Christ, it would make a phenomenal movie.<br /><br />This was my first foray into $.99 kindle books on Amazon, and what a joy that experiment has turned out to be -- I'm a convert, and will confidently continue.<br /><br />Well done Hugh! I'm looking forward to your continued success and to the smug feeling I'll get when you explode into the mainstream and I can feel I discovered you early. I love that feeling.

B002FL3JA0|3.0|I bought this hoping to leave my badly beaten 5th Edition at home and just bring my iPad to gigs. Without going into things like missing songs and strange chords on Blue Bossa, which I was prepared for, I ran into a HUGE problem with the Kindle edition. All of the 2 page songs require a PAGE TURN. The lack of page turns was a selling point in the Real Book so much that it's mentioned in the introduction. So now I've invested just shy of twenty bucks in a book I can't reliably use on jobs. DON'T BUY IT. On the Kindle. The paper version is fine as long as you correct some chords and just learn to live without the songs in the 5th edition.
B0072OFOM6|1.0|Where do I begin? The show's budget seems to have been reduced more, despite claims otherwise. There is no plot anymore. Every show is one excuse after the other to start a fight. Blood and gore, for any reason whatsoever. I loved last season, but this one was utterly sadistic to the point of discomfort and uneasiness. It starts getting really bad around episode five. The actor cast to replace Spartacus does a fine job, but the dialogue and writing failed him, as it did the other characters. The actress that replaced Naevia from season one, due to contract issues, is vastly inferior to her, acting-wise. She is so terrible, it takes the viewer out of the show. The writing is so bad, that all the characters are mere shadows of the season one self. It almost seems like this show has ignored its classy fans in favor of the UFC/WWE element this season. The show is, as I've heard others describe, now a Saturday Morning Cartoon. There are numerous, illogical encounters between Spartacus and the main villain this season, Glaber, almost like how Megatron and Optimus Prime used to duke it out in their various respective cartoon versions of the years. To add insult to injury, the show added a mute, invincible villain named The Egyptian, whose main purpose in the show probably is to appeal to junior high boys and sell toys.<br /><br />The IQ of this show has dropped so much from past seasons. Anyone longing for the complex, adult plot and writing from Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena will be disappointed so much, it will be like getting smacked by the hilt of Crixus's sword. From what I read from various comments around the internet, the season finale was the last straw for many viewers. It was ridiculous. There were several jump the shark moments. While there was one scene that struck me as disgusting and sick, it was the lone bright spot of the finale, if not the season, but it will haunt you for days to come. What happens in that scene, was also the reason many fans havedecided to quit this show.<br /><br />Do like I did; forget this season ever existed and cherish your copies of Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena. There's no point bothering with Vengeance. I can't think of anything the season did to advance the characters or the story, and that honestly, was a disgrace.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|The Notebook deserves a 5 star rating because it emotionally effects people, holds your attention, and has a great moral. The Notebook is about an old man that is so faithful to his wife that has Alzheimer's. He is so faithful that when his kids tell him to come home from the nursing home he stays with her. While staying with her he reads her a notebook about their past by the end of the movie as she is dying she remembers everything and they die holding hands.<br /><br />The last time I saw this movie was last Wednesday, I've watched it numerous times before, and despite that I still cry at the end.<br />The first reason I think this movie deserves a 5 star rating is the plot of the movie. The reason I like the plot of the movie is that it emotionally affects you. There are so many parts in this movie that are emotionally effective mostly because the girl (Allie) gets her hart broke twice but in the end it all turns out so good.<br /><br />The second reason I think this movie deserves a 5 star rating is that it holds your attention. For example the viewer knows that Noah (the boy character) writes her 365 letters a letter everyday for a year but Allie doesn't know because her mom hid the letters from her. A few days after he tells her that he wrote her, her mom brings the letters to her. That's when she finds out that he actually did write her.<br /><br />The third reason I think the movie deserves a 5 star rating is it has a great moral it tell you never to leave the people you love. Because one day they could come through to you and that there is nothing stronger than love. It also says never marry someone for their money you will wind up unhappy in the end. You should marry someone because you love them. For example the old man never leaves his wife's side even though she doesn't know who he is and she don't even know who her kids are.<br /><br />It was very difficult for me to find a downfall to this movie but after long and hard evaluation came to the conclusion that I disliked the mother in the movie. I dislike her because she is a hypocrite, I think this because when she was younger she liked a man that was poor. Now that she is grown and her daughter is in love with a poor man she gets so mad at her ant even makes her move out of town. when she should've been the one that understood the most.<br /><br />If you are looking for a movie that emotionally affects you, holds your attention, and has a great moral, than I highly recommend the movie \\"The Notebook\\".

B001B68XRY|5.0|When I watched The Longest Yard I was amazed. It was one of the greatest football movies. It was a funny movie with action.  I give The Longest Yard 5 out of 5 stars for the comedy, sports and well known people.<br /><br />The Longest Yard is about a former NFL quarterback Paul Crew. Paul Crew was sent to prison for more than one charge from drunk driving. The Warden specially requested for Paul Crew because he is a big football man and wants Paul Crew to form a football team with the inmates to play against the guards<br /><br />I watched this movie because I knew it had Adam Sandler in it and that it was about football.<br /><br />I liked this movie because it was really funny. I laughed so hard at this movie.<br /><br />I loved the fact that it was about football.<br /><br />There were a lot of recognizable people like Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, and Nelly the rapper.<br /><br />  The Longest Yard is a buy. It has a great mixture of comedy and action. If you like football, comedy, or action you would like this movie.<br /><br />By Dylan Sanders of 8th Period English
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|this is a great movie for anyone who loves the wizard of oz books but doesn't rilly care for musicals. it keeps pretty close to the books and is fun and enjoyable for the whole family.i highly recomend it for any one who loves fantisy,its also fun to see the look on peoples faces when they realise that the wizard of oz was based on a series of books and not a broadway musical,plus seeing the scary girl from the craft as a sweet inocent little girl is pretty funny
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|When home alone and needing a good laugh, Scary Movie will do the job. The movie is full of humor, keeps you captive on what is going to happen next but the movie doesn't end very well, so this is why the movie receives a 4/5 star review.<br /><br />I first saw the movie when I was at home mad. I had never seen the movie so I decided to watch it, the movie made my day turn from mad to great.<br /><br />The movie was made in 2001. It is just a reacted movie of Scream that was made funny. They turned a horror film into a comedy. This makes the movie a lot funnier after you have seen the horror film and then you watch the comedy version.<br /><br />The movie scary movie is full of humor. There is a huge emphasis on how the characters look the same as the characters from the real movie scream.<br /><br />Second, Scary movie packed the movie with actors I like. They make the movie way more interesting. It also is rumored to be the best scary movie out of the other three.<br /><br />Finally the movie is very easy to understand and easy to get to play. All you have to have is a DVD player that works and a TV. Unless, You are lucky enough to catch it on Satellite.<br /><br />The movie is very short. All of the comedy that is in it makes the movie fly by. It isn't but like a hour and twenty minutes long but seems way shorter. This may make it seem like a waste of money.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great humor movie, Scary Movie is the way to go. I just about guarantee you will love it.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|the game is fun. i like that it offers different cooking methods but is limited on what u can purchase without spending real time money.
B005TBN3EU|5.0|I give the Hangover Part 2 five out of 5 stars because each friend has a unique relatable personality, the dialog of this film was hilarious, and there is suspense throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />I watched The Hangover Part 2 this summer while it was still in theaters. I loved it so much and thought it was so outstanding that I went back three other times. When it was available on DVD I was sure to purchase it.<br /><br />This movie is the sequel to The Hangover. It is about 4 friends who have what was supposed to be a small and quiet bachelor party which turns into a night to remember. The guys wake up the morning after and are completely oblivious to what happened the previous night. They begin to back track while trying to hide what's happened from the groom to be's fiancée. They encounter many situations from angry monks to singing professional boxers.<br /><br />This film was so spectacular because each friend was easy to relate to in some way. Each of their personalities and curiosity made for an eventful film.<br />The dialog of this film is very intriguing. In some scenes they say the most random things while using very intelligent vocabulary and it somehow works together making the viewers laugh nonstop.<br /><br />Along with the hilarious dialog, there was never a dull moment. Something is always unexpectedly making you chuckle. There is always a situation needing to be solved.<br />Although this was an excellent movie, it could have been better if the Main Character from the following movie, Doug, was involved more in the events.<br /><br />This movie was crude, rude, and just fantastic is so many ways. If you've seen the first one 1 highly recommend you purchase the sequel.  I've seen it uncountable times and I laugh just as hard every single time I put it into my DVD player.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|This album ruled the mid-70's.ROCK and ROLL BAND they were!Straight out of BOSTON, playing right out in the street.A lot of great albums were released in '75-'76,this was one of them.If you had this album then, you know the story. No bad songs[truely] here!Many a baby-boomers child was conceived to this album,LOL.This album \\"ROCKS\\", worth much more than you're gonna pay for it. Best cranked up,great down low too!
B000OLROWC|5.0|The Karate Kid is about a teen named Daniel La Russo. He moved to California from New Jersey. When he arrives, he first meets the girl of his dreams. Then he meets her jealous ex boyfriend, who will do anything to get her back. The Karate Kid is one of the best 80s movies ever. This is the perfect movie for people looking for a movie with action, romance, and an unlikely friendship.<br /><br />The Karate Kid is a movie my dad liked. I'd never seen it before. My uncle got me the movie for my 14th birthday. When I first watched it, I instantly fell in love with the characters. I have watched it over and over again.<br />This movie is full of fighting and karate. Daniel and Johnny, the jealous ex, are enemies from the very beginning of the movie. Johnny is a part of the Kobra Kies, a karate club for the big shots. Johnny and his friends jump Daniel until Daniel finally is so sick of them he decides he will have to fight back, in the state karate tournament.<br /><br />Daniel and Ali, his perfect girl, fall for each other as soon as their eyes meet. Daniel puts everything at risk, even his own safety, to be with her. Ali is a rich girl from the other side of town and Daniel is the defently not from her side of town. Despite their many deference's, they love each other. Their love is realistic and something everyone can relate to.<br /><br />When Daniel realizes he will need help to fight back against Johnny, he finds an unlikely friendship with a janitor. Mr. Miyagi, who just happens to be a karate expert, sees Daniel and decides to help him. Daniel and Mr. Miyagi become close friends through karate training. This bond between mentor and student will make you laugh and cry.<br /><br />The only downside to this movie is that before Daniel learned karate, he was jumped just because he was dating Johnny's ex girlfriend. Ali broke up with Johnny several months before Daniel moved to town.<br /><br />I highly recommended this movie to anyone who loves awesome 80s movies, action romances, and Ralph Machio. This movie is a classic that has been re-watched through the decades.

B0043GXYBO|5.0|This book is very unusual and very addictive. It is the first book of the House of Night series that will have you turning the pages. I give this book 5stars because it's interesting, easy to compare yourself with the characters, and you'll learn more about them changing from fledglings into vampires.<br /><br />This book is mainly about a girl named Zoey being marked. There are trakers that mark people and Zoey gets marked during school. She is a Fledgling because she hasn't completed the change yet. She is left to find the house of Night, Where all the Fledglings attend school to learn about their vampire adulthood.<br /><br />One week during summer vacation, I stayed with my cousin at her mother-in-laws house. She showed me this book and encouraged me to read it. I liked it and started on the next book.<br /><br />This book has interesting details about the life of Fledglings. It never leaves you hanging and when it does then it usually picks back up later on in the book. They have a lot of crazy things that happen to them and they just can't figure out why.<br /><br />Second, the characters actually fit other people's lives. They are easy to compare yourself with. I can compare myself with Zoey and her friend Stevie Rae.<br /><br />This book is the first of the House of Night series. Throughout all the books you will learn more about them becoming a vampire. They have to complete a change and if they don't complete it then you will know because they will start bleeding everywhere and it will soon kill them afterwards.<br />The only thing that I didn't like is how she got to the House of Night School. She was going to her grandmothers when she fell and hit her head on a rock. She woke up in the House of Night with the High Priestess, Neferet, and her Grandmother standing over her bandaging her head.<br /><br />If you like fictional books that relate to reality in a way then this book is good for you.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is our second purchase of Settlers; the game is played so often in our home that the cards were only torn bits of the originals! The hexagon pieces that make up the board are still good, but the border pieces are also somewhat broken.  Regardless, this is one game that the entire family loves to play, generally playing two or more games consecutively - because everyone always wants one more chance to win.  Also, Michael Dean from Fine Games (where our order was shipped from) was great and sent it out immediately.  Enjoy!
0545265355|5.0|This series deserves 5/5 stars because it shows a girl taking power, it tells an amazing story, and a horrible government.<br /><br />In The Hunger Games the government controls everything. There are twelve districts. Every year the government has an annual Hunger Games. The government makes every district send a boy and girl tribute to an arena to fight to the death. Katniss Everdeen fights the government for freedom. Katniss volunteered for her sister at the reaping. This is how she came into the books.<br />I read the books last year when I kept hearing about The Hunger Games. So I tried it for myself and became in love with them. I wasn't able to put the books down.<br /><br />First, it tells an amazing story. I have never read a story that was written so well. I was never bored when reading The Hunger Games. I couldn't help but keep turning the pages.<br /><br />Secondly, it shows a girl taking power. She takes on the government somewhat by herself. She wants to change the way things are ran in the government. Katniss doesn't want there to be anymore Hunger Games.<br /><br />Last, In The Hunger Games it also has a horrible government. They make kids kill each other. They control everything. They sent out mockingjays to watch people so they could see if somebody was trying to rebel. That's why the games started. To remind everybody of what district 13 tried to do.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book you have to keep reading because it was kind of boring. So keep on reading to get to the really good parts.<br /> You should buy these books immediately and start reading!!! You won't be able to put them down. The Hunger Games is amazing!!!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I just watched Once one more time. I saw it the year it came out, based on the recommendations of several friends. Now five years later, I watched it again and got even more out of it. So much so, that I immediately purchased the soundtrack recording. (Not sure why I didn't the first time.)<br /><br />Besides the great music by Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, the evolving platonic love story between the two of them is incredibly refreshing in this day of meaningless sex. Here we have meaningful love, but in the end they both return to their former loves, even while knowing that something special has developed between the two of them.<br /><br />What I didn't catch the first time is how the music in many places propels the plot forward. Even a line in the show given in Czech and never translated, gives a hint as to what's really going on.<br /><br />This film is delightful, and the fact that the film is low budget adds to the innocent quality of whole thing: music, story and location. I mean, what's not to love about Dublin?
B003Y5H5C4|5.0|This movie deserves a 5/5 ratings because It has a funny pizza delivery guy and two weird/funny guys.<br />It always makes me laugh and has a great story line. Almost every scene is funny.<br /><br />The movie character Is a guy name Nick Davis. He's a pizza delivery guy who gets held hostage because he has to rob a bank. The guys that strapped a bomb on his chest are two weird guys who wants to gets rich and they had a plan to get rich. Nick later tell his friend who's a teacher and that he has a bomb on his chest and he only has 10 hours to rob a bank or he's going to blow up.<br /><br />There are a lot of funny scenes in the movie but my favorite was when Nick and his friend just robbed the bank and a black cop comes up with his car and told them to drop their weapons. They both did. But then Nick unzipped his jacket and shows the cop the bomb and the cop ran faster than ever. It is my favorite part of the whole movie.  It always makes me laugh every time I watch that part.<br /><br />The thing I dislike about the movie is that there's a confusing part in the movie. And the movie should  be longer. It is only 1 hour and 45 long.<br />You should buy this movie if you want to laugh and have a good time. You can also learn from this movie.
B005VPRF0M|4.0|After a few years of acquiring a lot of Lego sets for my son, I was heartened to see the advent of something in addition to the usual \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"City\\" offerings.  While my son will tear into any Lego and build away with focused abandon, he was excited to see the new superhero product line featuring Batman.  I got this for him for his seventh birthday and he couldn't have been more thrilled when he peeled off the Lego wrapping paper (which I got from the Lego site).  He had it all assembled within an hour or two.  It comes with a Batman, a Joker, a Batplane, and a helicopter piloted by one of the Joker's henchmen.  As with everything Lego, it was a bit pricey, but it was exactly what he wanted . . . along with the Batcave and the other two Batman sets (Batgirl, Two-Face Chase).

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|When I first started reading reviews to decide if I should buy into all the hype of the books I have to say I almost did not purchase because I kept hearing \\" teen\\". I thought the books were written for the teen audience and being I am 42 figured it wouldn't be for me. After asking a few friends who read the series I realized it isn't just targeted for the younger audience. So buy into I did.<br /><br />I have to say I found this series hard to put down. I read the entire series in less then a week.<br /><br />The book seems very familiar to me because I am old enough to remember the movie called \\" The Running Man\\"... it does have a lot in common with that but with a twist.<br />I found the series a bit predictable ( thus the 4 stars and not 5) but still very enthralling and enjoyable.<br /><br />I will admit I was disappointed with the last book. I know the last in a series is where the author will try to tie up all the loose ends but it became a bit long in dialogue and tedious. Unlike other books where I don't want the book to end, I was kinda waiting for it to end this time. I would have to say the third book is probably the most predictable of them all.<br /><br />I don't like to give away a lot of the story in my reviews so I will leave it at this. Its a fun, imaginative, dark, intense book and a great way to pass some time if you love to read.

She even brought this book to her Kindergarten class for the Show and Tell to share with her friends.  Eveybody in the class loved Pete!  Some of her friends even requested her to bring this book again.  This book has a lot of sight words, repetition, and colorful art which kids absolutely love.  The downloadable audio story is also my daughter's favorite thing to listen to.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Having read the Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter series many years ago, I looked very forward to this movie. I re-read the first 3 books in preparation. My wife and 2 adult children, all scifi fans, also felt that Disney had actually done the books justice (not a big Disney fan for scifi, e.g. \\"The Black Hole\\"). I normally ignore critics. IMHO, they are people who have managed to turn going to the movies into a job, and think they know something that the rest of the public doesn't - namely, that the public is too dumb to make up their own minds. The movie did great everywhere else in the world. I read a review in an English language Indian newspaper where the author commented on the lack of appreciation of the American movie going public, asking if Americans were not capable of following a plot line and enjoying a classic book told on the screen.<br /><br />The movie held to the original story line well, bringing in some elements from the later books to smooth out some transitions. Keeping in mind that the first book, written 100 years ago, actually spanned 10 years on Mars for John Carter, I thought they did an excellent job of keeping the plot line moving smoothly. Although a few of the things they did deviated from the book, they deviated just enough to allow for 100 years advances in science and technology to, again IMHO, improve the story line for modern viewers.<br /><br />All in all, a definitely worthwhile movie. Preordered my copy today. 5 stars, highly recommended.
B005ONTD42|1.0|It's a neat toy worth maybe $20. My wife was astonished to hear how much it cost. I got this as a gift and it'll make for an occasional conversation piece, but realistically a self-moving ball that only kinda works is a letdown. The novelty wears off quickly. Considering the flying fish, helicopters and other remote toys out there, this ball is not that interesting.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really love the graphics and everything about this game. it's reallt fun to play!  it's. challenging but not to difficult to play. keep them coming.:
0439023513|2.0|I enjoyed reading the first two books so much that I had a hard time setting them down. The third book however felt like more of a chore than anything else. I found myself re-reading the pages and forgetting what I just read because it was so boring. In the end, nothing made sense. I wasn't expecting a neat and tidy ending but I did want a well written book that pulled me in to their world like the first two books did.<br />I think the author had a great idea for a book but never really figured out how to finish the story. This book was almost a complete disappointment but I gave it two stars because I liked the epilogue.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I stepped away from this book so disappointed.  I'm not upset about how the story ended, but just how it got there.  Reading three books with hundreds of pages for the climax of the story and finale to be finished in a couple of pages!  Was the author rushed?  Was she trying to meet a deadline?  Was she tired of writing?  Well, that is how it feels!  I read pages of descriptions about Buttercup, nightmares, food, clothing, etc, only to read the burning of Katniss, death of Coin and fall of the capital in a couple pages.  So disappointing.  So many questions.  So blah.  The author could have even stretched this out into a fourth book.  I'm glad I only interrupted a week of my life to read all three books.  The screen writers for the third movie will have their hands full, trying to FINISH the author's book to be acceptable for the screen and the fans who won't be reading the books.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|I did enjoy this book, and have to admit that the series is decidedly addictive to this reader. Still, the gore and insanities seem more than excessive. I supp[ose Martin means us to be very clear as to what a low point the seven kingdoms have come to--not just ruled by fools and arrogant self-serving folk but really spun about by the mad. Even so, it strikes this reader as excessive.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I had HBO for a brief time, then let it go.  However, during that time I got hooked on this series in two Episodes!!.  So, I bought it.  My wife and I started and couldn't stop.  We knocked off 75% of the series over the weekend.  I cannot wait for season 2.  I almost considered HBO just for this series, but not quite (more of a DirecTV protest).  One thing to note....this series is NOT for children.  The reality protrayed for the times is brutal and intense.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I like the game, it keeps me entertained. I think that adding friends should be easier. I also don't really care that I have to post to my facebook for people to click in stuff. that will ultimately cause me not to play the game.
B0034G4P4Y|1.0|My family is on a roadtrip and all i wanted was for them to get a surprise movie on the ipad. I went to Amazon and then thought, gee I would like the DVD, too. This is a big mistake. First of all, I should I have guessed it was going to be a be hassle because there was no description in the product details about the actual digital copy. I assumed it was through amazon. You have to sign up/create an account on not one but two websites to finally get your movie. And the best part - even thought it says right on the DVD - works with itunes, it does not!!!!!! You have to download an application to actually get your movie and at that point find out you cannot put it in Itunes (even though it says you can) hoping to get my money back!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good fun game to play, very entertaining and gives you plently of gaming choices. I would highly reccomd to anyone who loves challenging games
B005KR6OBM|1.0|I love the series.  My wife and I watch them all the time.  I can't wait for the new season to come out on disk.  I got them at sears for $75 after shipping.  Not a great price on Amazon.  This is one of the few items I found a better deal elsewhere.
B00000JMOF|5.0|FRANKENSTEIN<br /><br />Few monsters are so recognizable as James Whale's in Frankenstein as played by Boris Karloff and make-up artist Jack Pierce.  But as great as that monster is, the movie is wonderful in other respects--the script, acting, set design--all make this one of the most well rounded horror films ever made and a continual joy to watch.<br /><br />Whale's adaptation strays quite a bit from the book, so it isn't wrong to say that his version of Frankenstein is somewhat original.  In the film version, the Doctor, aided by his deformed and loyal assistant Fritz, embarks on a sinister plan to reanimate dead flesh into a living being.  It's a noble plan and hits upon an age old fault of men--pride and arrogance.  Grave robbing is bad enough, but the good Doctor touches on the blasphemous, declaring in the infamously censored scene when he yells \\"Now I know what it feels like to be God!\\"  Never the less, he brings the creature to life only to find it less than satisfactory and under some peer pressure agrees to destroy the beast.  Things go wrong (naturally) and the Doctor finds himself pitted against the creature in a life or death struggle.<br /><br />What's great about the movie is Whale's adherence to Shelly's humanistic approach to the story.  All the characters are very real and sympathetic.  Even the lowly Fritz whose delights include grave robbing and tormenting Frankenstein's poor creature evokes feeling from the viewer.  The tale itself seems to be one big tragic story.  Frankenstein, despite his faults and lack of better judgment, is still human and deserving of our pity.  The monster takes center stage in this department.  He's done nothing wrong and asked just for love and understanding, but receives instead torment and pain.  In many ways the monster is the best representative of the human condition, a man trapped in a harsh and unforgiving world, whose creator abandons him, and like one who is scorned, the monster seeks to destroy his creator.<br /><br />There are numerous memorable visuals in this movie.  The most obvious is the laboratory scene when Frankenstein brings his creature to life.  Most people overlook it, but a lot of work and thought went into creating the \\"mad-scientist laboratory\\" complete with a range of instruments with no real purpose other than to look exciting.  The monster's first appearance as he walks into the room backwards and then the close-up, all done in nearly complete silence accentuate the suspense.  Then there is the finale at the windmill between the two main characters, facing one another as the whole place incinerates around them.<br /><br />The acting, while seemingly simple, was actually pretty in depth.  The three persons who stand out are Colin Clive (the Doctor), Karloff, and Dwight Fry (Fritz).  They are an odd ensemble and not only do they all give great performances, but they don't have a single dull moment between them.  Some people criticize Karloff because his role is so drab, but his version of the monster is in complete contrast with that in the novel and in some ways, a bit more complex.  Remember, in the novel the monster is actually an intelligent and physical marvel whereas Karloff's creature seems mentally dull, uncoordinated, incapable of speech or spiritual substance.  One can feel great pity for the confused beast while simultanously loathing it as the abomination that it is.  Clive  definied the classic image of the mad scientist, his line \\"It's alive!\\" is immortal.  Fry, too, defined the hunchbacked assistant as no other could.<br /><br />Another aspect worth mentioning is how the movie flows.  It moves around very nicely so you're constantly engaged in the story.  Whale was a master at introducing spectacle to break up periods of dialogue but without going overboard.  It's also nice to see how the characters develop and never become dull or unbelievable.  Frankenstein's range of emotions go from ambitious scientist to humbled man in such a way that is totally compelling.<br /><br />Frankenstein is overall just a jewel of a horror movie.  It never gets old and will always stand out as a solidly constructed movie.  It's effects and messages are just as potent today as they were in 1931 and it features some famous horror actors at their prime.  The very best movie from the genres very best director.hat is totally compelling.<br /><br />Frankenstein is overall just a jewel of a horror movie.

0345803485|5.0|I heard about the books on GMA.  I was worried that it would be all about the sex and there would be no story line.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I couldnt put the book down.  I read the first book in 2 days and then purchased the other 2.  Took me a week to finish all 3. Plain ol' vanilla is good, but I think deep down most people also want the erotic/on the verge of dangerous too.  Can certainly add spice to your life!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm not going to lie... I cried. This is the toughest and most gritty of the books.<br />Mockingjay starts out where Catching Fire left off; Katniss is in District 13 with Gale and Haymitch. The rebels were unable to retrieve Peeta from the games.<br /><br />Katniss is learning to deal with her new life, and her new role as the Mockingjay. She aches for Peeta, and what he must be going through in the hands of the Capitol, but there's nothing she can do. The war is raging, and the rebels seem to be holding their own. But who will win this war? And when they win, what will be left?<br /><br />This book completely and utterly tore me apart. Suzanne Collins completely and utterly has a way with words. This book is truly about rebellion, and the struggles and pain of war, and death. Katniss is left with almost nothing but her family, and she needs to learn to deal with it. Honestly, she doesn't do a very good job at first, but she ends up managing alright.<br /><br />This book, being the final in the trilogy is of course the most epic. This book will make you sit on the edge of your seat, and it will also make you cry. This series is one that everyone needs to read at least once in their life, since it touches every part of you, and also lets you know a few things about yourself that you didn't know before. I'm sad the trilogy is over, but Ms. Collins could not have ended it in any better way than she did.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This was an Epic fail on Disney's part for not getting behind this film. I cannot say enough good about this movie. It is rare that a film grabs me and pulls me in from start to finish as thoroughly as John Carter did. I won't rehash the plot or review the actual film, but I can say without a doubt that this is a must purchase. If you missed out on this in theaters due to the shoddy/lack of marketing and/or ridiculously negative reviews from critics who hadn't actually watched the film then you owe it to yourself to buy this Blu Ray.<br /><br />I truly believe this movie will become a classic despite it's \\"flop\\" beginnings. I took my 7 and 9 year old boys to this in the theater and they couldn't stop talking about it! (Neither could I for that matter.) If Disney would have done right by this it could have been their \\"Star Wars\\".

I am 63 and over the years have read many, many Sci-Fi books as well as others.  I loved the Omnibus and didnt want to put it down.  What a great movie this would make.  I just want to read more about this world and these people.  I will read all of the authors other books as well.  Thank you for the great story.

0385342063|4.0|This book was alot of fun. I wanted to read something light and purely entertaining, this was definitely a case of the right book at the right time hittting the right spot. I kind of inhaled it. I won't bother retelling the plot because quite honestly it doesn't matter. It's exactly what you'd expect from Sophie Kinsella. After reading page one you know exactly how the story will play out, who will be together in the end and who will get their comeuppance and you go along for the ride and enjoy yourself immensely. I listened to part of it while driving. It felt good to be laughing while driving.
0439023521|5.0|This book takes us on a journey of conquest, and represents a modern day, very American, version of the Illiad.  Survival, in a brutal, gladiatorial world amounts just as much to obtaining good audience response, in the Hollywood environment, under constant televised scrutiny, as to one's facility with weapons.  Each year, two teenagers, one a boy and one a girl, are chosen from each of the twelve districts that pay tribute to the Capitol, the realm of the \\"gods\\", to participate in the games that demonstrate the absolute control of the Capitol over the lives and livelihoods of people in the districts.  Welcome to North America of the future.<br /> The narration is from the point of view of the \\"lucky\\" girl from district 12 chosen to compete in this year's games.  She plays the role, not only of Helen of Troy, of the Iliad, but of Paris, in the end using an arrow to strike at the vulnerable point of the \\"Achilles\\" of the tale.  It is extremely interesting to see the war before the \\"plains of Illium\\", from the point of view of the character who is treated as so cowardly in the actual Illiad.  The author is sufficiently skillful that she makes what could easily be a rather repulsive character into a tragic figure, and I think at the end of the book, just as if we had witnessed a performance of a Greek tragedy, we are privy to her erroneous view of the world, while at the same time feeling very sympathetic toward her as a human being caught in an unwinnable situation.<br /> I found myself wondering, in the end, who the gods were.  The people of the Capitol seemed just as much caught up in the Hollywood fakery as the girl in the gladiatorial competition.  They all seemed to represent tragic figures, puppets in the hands of the gods behind the scenes to whom we never have any direct contact.  The Capitol proves in the end to be just as much as a gladiatorial arena as that of the games.  Who are the gods?  Certainly, the \\"fall of Troy\\" does not seem to end the tale by any means.  It whet my appetite for the second volume in the series, despite the brutal, harsh nature of this first volume.<br /> I found the writing to be superb.  The author has a real gift for timing and for posing puzzles that she can resolve in interesting ways.  On the other hand, although this is a book about teenagers, its tragic unfolding and its brutal plot are very serious, and strike Americans at the heart of their Hollywood mentality, and fixation with materialism and technology.  This is a tragedy built around greed and ultimately one that is quite meaningful for Americans as a whole, not just for teenagers.  I recommend this book, but the world it displays is a terrible world, perhaps bearing too close an affinity with the actual world.means.

145162445X|1.0|This book is misleading and disappointing. It does not answer the basic question that its title suggests: why there is something rather than nothing? As the physicist put the question: where did the stuff that \\"banged\\" in the big bang come from? Instead of addressing this philosophical question, Dr. Krauss addresses the scientific question of why that stuff is structured (\\"something\\") rather than unstructured (\\"nothing\\"). He may answer why there is a structured universe and not empty space. Not being a Ph.D. in physics I could not follow all the references in answer to that question, so I don't think the book succeeds if it is addressed to the general public. But he definitely misses the real issue that his title suggests.<br /><br />Another complaint is his jabs at religion. Perhaps they were meant to be humorous, but Dr. Krauss should know that not all religious people who see God as the answer to the basic philosophical cosmological question -- rather than the scientific question -- are idiots.
B005FITIDC|5.0|I was fortunate to see one of the few showings of this movie and was blown away by the message it sends.  How can people treat children in the horrendous way they are doing in the area of the world where this movie is set?  I had expected a good film, but this was far better than good.  Gerard Butler was at his best and you could see how he put his heart into showing the adversity it represented.  What a shame that it was never given enough theaters to get it's message out to the public.  I saw it on my birthday at the Archlight theater in Hollywood and was stunned when I turned a corner into the theater and ran right into Mr. Butler. He stayed to tell the people in two showings of the film about the message, and how people can help the situation. This is one of the most caring actors who grace our films today.  I am anxiously awaiting the release of the DVD so I can show and share its message with many of my friends.<br />  It is beyond me that one person gave this film such a horrible review. That person complained about elements it contained saying how awful they were.  YES!  They were awful because the film was telling the truth about man's inhumanity to not only men, but innocent children.

B00756GKBA|5.0|Love it.  I am a huge fan, and basically like everything she does...not because I am an idiot and not because everything she does is perfect.  But because, IF you like intense dance music, she delivers it...over and over and over again.  You have to \\"get\\" this in your bones, and if you don't, stay away from Madonna...and certainly don't review her music.  She has evolved a lot over the years and some people got off the train as things changed - and that is certainly ok.  Personally, I really enjoy the way she manages to blend past and present...and give us a taste of the future.  Oh, and for the same reasons, Hard Candy was fantastic.  Sometimes she is more innovative, sometimes she is more pure dance, sometimes she is more vulnerable.  She cannot be reviewed or judged based on a singular criterion. Her music needs to be understood and appreciated as a whole...the same is true for most artists, of course.  And as a whole, this album just might be perfect.

B0073XORCY|3.0|I am listening to this album as I review it, so I will give my first impression so far.  This will be a real-time review.<br /><br />First off, I will say I am a longtime Jethro Tull fan, since the 80's.  I saw them live for the first time on their \\"Crest of a Knave\\" tour and was blown away by how excellent they were.<br /><br />When I first heard \\"Thick As A Brick\\" I loved everything about it.  The musicianship and the compositional dynamics were staggering.  But moreover, it had POWER.  It ROCKED.  It GRABBED me.  It REELED ME IN.  It TOOK ME ON A JOURNEY.  It was STRONG.  It made a statement, even if I couldn't exactly make out what that statement was.  It had CONVICTION.<br /><br />Well, I suppose I'm a little naive for hoping \\"Thick As A Brick 2\\" would be a grand return to form for Ian Anderson, given that it is a sequel to the first TAAB.  I guess the early stuff was a product of a young man and at 65 those days are long behind and not coming back.  I suppose I should just accept that.<br /><br />So what do I think of this album so far?  Well, like anything Ian Anderson does, the musicianship and the compositional skills are exquisite and in fine form.  But to be blunt, it lacks BALLS.  The production is too CLEAN.  So clean in fact that it sucks the life out of the music.  I would've preferred if the production was just a touch grittier.<br /><br />That's the problem with Tull/Ian Anderson music since the 80's.  The production is TOO good, too polished.  And with the line-up changing so frequently, every album sounds like it was recorded with studio musicians.  There's no feeling of a stable band that has had time to gel and develop a cohesive sound that only it can reproduce.<br /><br />I can't rightly say it's a BAD album, it just doesn't sound as INSPIRED as the first TAAB.<br /><br />Regardless, I have my ticket for the Houston show on Oct. 27th.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I never did get a chance to read [[ASIN:0399157913 The Help Deluxe Edition]], but its on my list because I just loved the movie.  Not only is it an extremely fun and entertaining movie to watch, it's insightful to the time period in which this film takes place.  I know that it may not be 100% accurate, but I feel that it's always good to have your eyes opened to history.  The Help certainly gets my stamp of approval.
B002Q9MZHE|4.0|This is a beautiful movie. The one complaint up front is Villazon. I have Manon and La Traviata with Villazon and Netrebko. Villazon looks like he is straining all the time. In every one of them. Anna sings so effortlessly it is a joy to watch her. (I also have her in Le Nozzi di Figaro). However, I really love this movie version. I recognized the symptoms of TB right off. Anna presents advancing sickness so well, is so vulnerable right from the beginning. The four men act as if they are really young and struggling, happy to excess when money is available for them to pretend to an evening of fun. The moodiness of the entire movie drags one into the story. Even the evening of laughter and gaiety we know will end with all characters returning to desperate times.The search for love unattainable seems to be everyone's story in this. Finally Rodolfo and Mimi admit there undying love just as the inevitable happens. I mean this IS opera. The conclusion is forgone. Only four stars due to Villazon's effort. And it does seem to be an effort for him. Had anyone told me I would like Opera or Ballet a year ago I would have smote his nose. Go figure.
B0017CW5J4|2.0|The \\"Blue Man Group - The Complex Rock Tour Live\\" on DVD is a much better concert than \\"Blue Man Group: How to Be a Megastar Live!\\"<br /> a good example of this is the song I Feel Love in this DVD it is sung by Adrian Hartley and it doesn't even come close to the performance of Venus Hum/Annet Strean singing I feel Love in the \\"Blue Man Group - The Complex Rock Tour Live\\".

Excellent movie I only wish they had completed it with how long each survivor lived after the nightmare.  I won't go into detail and spoil it for other viewers but if you are someone who needs to know that miracles can happen, this is your movie.

It offers an extremely practical and holistic way to approach a persons ambitions and what he/she needs to do, feel and earn to feel fulfilled. Unlike a lot of other books, this one will stick with you. The way you look and act on oppurtunities in your life will never be the same.

B003H9MSPG|4.0|I think although the Longstrike could've shoot further, it seems all right. It looks really realistic and I love the fact that this toy has a removable barrel extension. The barrel extension makes the gun shoot more accurately, however decreasing the shooting distance. It was quite easy to mod; I suggest lengthening the spring and drilling out the air resistors. I increased range from about 30 feet to 45 feet. Overall, I think this a pretty good gun.<br /><br />Looks = 9/10<br /><br />Accuracy = 8/10<br /><br />Shooting distance = 7/10<br /><br />8/10 total, or 4 stars.

B0060AY6FO|1.0|I had great hopes for this book, as some reviews were quite glowing. The premise was very interesting and promising. However, even from the first chapter, I could tell this book would be a chore to read. I'm glad I borrowed this from my public library, because I would have been disappointed to pay even $1 for it, let alone $12.99. It took me 8 days to read this book, and most books I can finish in 2 days.<br /><br />A chapter would begin to hold my interest and abruptly the chapter would end, or you would begin reading about other characters. Brief moments of dialogue were interspersed with an overabundance of narration. And when dialogue took place, there seemed to be too much effort placed on using style and words from Pride and Prejudice. Since this is a continuation and not a \\"what if\\", the author could have saved herself the trouble and made a more interesting book.

B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|Finally an intelligent action movie with an amazing cast to back it up.  What's even more amazing is that I never heard of this chick, and when I looked her up it all made sense.  She's some Ultimate fighter in real life and boy can she fight.  I can't wait to see this movie again, I get chills just thinking about how great it was, Not one person in the theater did not like it.  I know they left the ending for a sequel and I hope they make one, because I will be the first one in line to see it! The previews really do not do justice for this amazing action movie, hands down better than 95% of all that crap that was out there last year!!!
B003V2HWP0|4.0|The movie was brought to my attention by a man - yes a man. He told me I should watch the movie Firelight as it is the kind of love he was looking for in life. Well, I do not completely share his need for the dramatics afterall love is tough enough on  it's own without having to add in a married man, a wife in a coma, and the pregnant governess that had your child. All in all it was a wonderful movie and I was delighted with it. It made me smile and I felt...happy when it was over. Yes yes yes...it is a sappy chick flick...I am surprised any guy would like it.....but then it also stars that gorgeous Sophie Marceau so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised that a man liked the movie. I would definatley tell any woman that wanted to have an afternoon of girl movies that this is at the top!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|My husband and I love this show! Its one of the only shows we agree on and get excited about. We loved it so much we now own seasons 1-4 on DVD.

0307352145|5.0|Every once in a while, a book comes along that just knocks your socks off. Quiet by Susan Cain is one of those books. I originally ordered the book thinking that I would us it to help out some of the shier students in my classroom. The last thing I thought of was the book helping me. But I guess life is just full of surprises like that. And who thought that a psychology book would actually help someone besides a psychologist?    Susan Cain digs deep into her own psyche and experiences, along with a deep well of studies - each chapter is packed with interesting data from various psychological studies - and stories of some of the great introverts of our time. A few of these individuals you may have heard of: Gandhi, Rosa Parks, Steve Wozniak, Warren Buffet, Lewis Carroll, and many others. Oh...also some guy named Einstein (You may have heard of him.). Some of them changed their financial futures, and some changed the financial futures of others, while some where content to do something silly, like change the world. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is an incredible look    into the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the introvert. If you're not sure which of those you are, then definitely get the book. If you are sure of what you are...definitely get the book. Introversion takes many forms. I'm not sure if it's exactly one of those snowflake scenarios, but maybe (or maybe it's just still snowing in April in Idaho, so snowflakes are on the mind). At any rate, if you are an introvert, work with an introvert, are the parent of an introvert, the spouse of an introvert, or you just want to know what an introvert is, then check this book out.    Cain's point is not to say that introverts are better or more necessary than introverts. Rather, she makes the point that we need to find a way to better access and develop our introverts. From business, to schools, to the little piece of introvert that lies within us all - okay, I made that last partup myself - we need to be intentional about the \\"shy\\" kid who sits in the back of the classroom. Oftentimes this shyness can be seen as \\"weakness\\" or a lack of social understanding. And this may well be true, but being slow, thoughtful, or methodical is not to be \\"`weak.\\" Rather, it is a different way to interact with the stimuli in around you.    There is far too much to say about the depth and grace with which Cain is able to dive into this incredible topic. As she says, anywhere from one in three to one in two are introverts. So let's stop talking over the top of them and hear what they have to say. When I say \\"them\\" I mean \\"us.\\" I'm an introvert, loud and proud...or quiet and pensive. I personally learned a great deal about myself from this book that I will apply on a daily basis. How often can you say that about a book, eh? If you have any form of social anxiety, or know someone who does, this is definitely your book. Buy it. Read it. Pass it along.    If you want to check out a better synopsis than what my meager review can represent, check out Susan Cain talking about her journey at TEDtalks. If you're not drawn in, then I'll never bother you again.    [...]  Introverts of the world unite! But quietly...I'm sure we'll be meeting in a library.    I received this book free from in order to review it. There is no requirement to give a positive review. Avoid purchasing it if you do not like being challenged by the books you read; basically, if you like walking away from mirrors forgetting what you looked like.

B0047Y17P2|4.0|It seems I can't get enough of the lawyer working out of the back seat of his Lincoln. Connelly hooked me in his first Haller novel, Lincoln Lawyer, what a novel idea. This novel doesn't fail to deliver what I have come to expect from Mr. Connelly, from start to finish. Although many suspsicions arise early on, the nice, neatly wrapped package isn't delivered until the end. I can't get enough of Michael<br />Connelly, well done sir.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I loved The Descendants.  If you are expecting to see an epic film (such as Titanic, Gone With the Wind, etc.), then you are going to be disappointed.  It doesn't have that incredible pomp, which is why some people felt that it was more of a tv \\"Movie of the Week\\" type movie.  What it does have is a realistic human portrayal of a family going through very difficult times.  Set in Hawaii, with beautiful, melodic Hawaiian songs and scenery, it provides for a very soulful experience, with some amusing scenes along the way.  The movie draws you in, and transforms you, particularly if you have ever been to Hawaii as I have two years ago.  This is a clever movie that accesses your emotions that somehow, when put together, are less common that other movie experiences.  But, since the experience falls just a little bit short of the incredible pomp that we have seen in major epic movies, I think some people are not giving it all the credit that this incredible movie deserves.  I strongly recommend this movie.
B004UID2LC|5.0|watch videos u downloaded without wi fi. need I say more? the format is good its quick and efficiant the design appears bad but who cares?!
B0041VV03A|3.0|This movie is a combination of Frankenstein, ET, Gremlins, and similar films. It is moderately entertaining, although the lead characters -- including the animal-human hybrid -- are excruciatingly painful and annoying to watch. Gosh - I wanted them all to die throughout the film. Yet, I still made it through. The 1- and 2-star reviewers are having histrionic fits over nothing. Ignore them.
B0041VV03A|5.0|This movie is, first and foremost, an astonishingly sustained and freakishly witty allegory/anxiety dream about becoming a parent for the first time. When it's really cooking on that level, it's just sublime. The entire production boasts fresh, beautifully executed takes on a whole range of stock genre devices (no mean feat in itself) with the end result being a fine, clawed and flawed little fable in the grand manner.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|You'll either love it or forget it. Two things that hurt the movie were one, it had to massive amount of hype, and two it had rape scenes. No one and i mean not one person i've talked to would not have loved to fast forwarded through the sexual abuse. I know that the entire story line hinged on this, but come on. Get creative and give movie goers a way out. If american history x, I spit on your grave, bother you then so will this. The hype behind this move was every were. Don't put this up against the swiss version. They are different movies altogether. The acting was good, the story line was not bad, and the scenery is beautiful. I gave this movie five stars for those things. Make your own opinion.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought all three books were very well written with a realistic feel of war.

B00785P2QC|4.0|I started playing this game in February. I became very addicted. A few days ago I started having problems with the game. It wouldn't load. I tried everything. I went to the website to learn about troubleshooting information. I was told to uninstall and then re-install the game. This completely wiped out my current game! I was sooooo pissed off! I had over 550000000 city credits! Now I have to completely start over! I had soo much time invested in that game! It was my favorite game and I don't know if I want to re-invest all my time again. I was very disappointed. I don't want to get to the same point just to have problems again.

0553801473|1.0|What a disappointment.  After waiting all these years I found the book I was so looking forwards to reading repulsive.  Instead of the author being so vulgar in places where it wasn't called for, he should have taken the time to develope the story  as he did in his previous books.  This book didn't flow.  It most certainly wasn't a page turner.  Instead I struggled to read it and actually stopped for long periods of time since it failed to hold my interest.  In the future if he writes another book, I will wait for at least a year to find out what others really think of it.  Or even better borrow it from the library to make sure I get my money back from this bomb.
0307341550|4.0|To say that Gillian Flynn's \\"Sharp Objects\\" is dark is to make dark things seem bright and shiny.  Since I'd just finished her newest book, \\"Gone Girl\\" (loved it) - I had some idea what to expect - but even then - parts of the book shocked me.<br /><br />This small town story of murder explores new depths of furtive, desperate evil.  The sharp contrasts between what seems like a sleepy, non-descript village and startling cruelty and depravity had me constantly raising my eyebrows.<br /><br />\\"My mother poured recklessly but perfect, capping off my glass just before it overflowed.  Still, a trick to get it to my mouth without spilling.  She smirked a little as she watched me.  Leaned back against the newel post, tucked her feet under her, sipped.  \\"I think I finally realized why I don't love you,\\" she said.\\"<br /><br />Camille, the main character, has experienced so much pain, both from other people and self inflicted.  Every part of her is soft.  Every part of her world is sharp and vicious.  The reader senses almost immediately that she is not up to the task of facing the demons of her childhood.<br /><br />\\"Tomorrow this spot would be filled with kids beginning their long, lazy summer.  Now it was just me, feeling sticky and stupid.  I couldn't decide if I'd been mistreated.  By Richard, by those boys who took my virginity, by anyone.  I was never really on my side in any argument.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sharp Objects\\" was a good book, if a tough one to read.  By the end, the reader has to fight off the pervading sense of hopelessness along with Camille.  Still, this is a good first novel and knowing where Flynn was headed with her third book, seems a good entry to her world.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|DVD came way before the listed date. It was wrapped and intact. Only thing is, the case is a little cheaper than a DVD you would buy in a store, BUT the price difference makes it worth it!
0345803485|3.0|First off, some people need to realize that you have to take these books for what they are worth. At the root of it all they are romance books. The fact that there's not a picture of Fabio bowing over some sprawled out chicky with her cleavage busting over her dress doesn't change their genre, so for all you literary snobs, get over yourselves. It's a romance novel. It's not going to be great literature.<br /><br />Also, it's obvious that they were meant to be mainstream, so even though it touches on BDSM there's nothing incredibly scandalous going on, so for all you hardcore BDSMers upset that it's so tame as far as BDSM goes you have to get over yourselves too - put the book down, back away slowly and then console yourself by rearranging your nipple clamp drawer or perusing the interwebz for kinky hogtie pr0n or something. (On the opposite side, if you're a prude with a disdain for all things sex-related, then I don't know why you'd even be reading reviews for this book and I'm sorry you choose to live such a horrible existence. Perhaps you should live a little. Poke your head out of that frigid little shell of yours and go out and get laid.)<br /><br />In a nutshell, these books are quick, easy, entertaining reads aimed at chicks (yeah chicks - I can't see many d00ds wanting to read this crap) who 1) dont mind romance novels, 2) aren't offended by somewhat graphic sex descriptions and 3) aren't expecting extreme, hardcore BDSM porn. If these things don't apply to you, don't read the effing book.<br /><br />So as mentioned, they aren't literary genius and they aren't supposed to be. That being said, there are predictably some irksome things about the writing. First of all, why are people murmuring all the time? She murmured this. He murmured that. Someone is murmuring something to someone else on every single page. And with all that murmuring going on, nobody ever says, \\"Huh? What? I can't hear you! Speak the eff up! You're murmuring, dammit!\\" So I guess all the characters must have better hearing than I do.<br /><br />Also, Ana (the female protagonist) loves to say \\"oh my!\\" It seems to be the only exclamation she knows, in fact, which is odd because I don't really remember the last time I uttered those words, except in jest. I expect it said in cases like: \\"Oh my!  What big teeth you have, grandma.\\"  or, \\"Oh my, whatever will I do?\\" [back of hand thrown over eyes in a dramatic fashion] \\"Alas Alas I do not know how I will find the will to go on!\\"  but in cases like, \\"Oh my! What a large member you have bulging from your pants!\\" I expect a different exclamation than \\"Oh my!\\", but maybe that's just me...<br /><br />And lastly, people's breath \\"hitches\\" a lot in this book (as in, \\"This discussion is so hot and scandalous that my breath hitches in excitement and surprise!\\").  The first time I read it, I thought - \\"hey, what a nice description!\\" But after the 587th time it's used, it tends to get old.<br /><br />I realize the author is never going (nor trying) to be confused with Conrad or Dickens and that there are no red suns pasted in the sky like wafers (if you get this reference, congrats - you just passed 7th grade English), but having a variety of verbs and adjectives could have made the book far less distracting to read.  For whatever reason, the murmuring thing was the most distracting to me, especially because people are often murmuring in places where (IMO) they shouldn't be, so I have this mental image of the characters with smirky smarmy grins on their faces soft talking during all their conversations to each other which sort of ruins the general sentiment of the book for me.<br /><br />As expected from the genre, the character development is trite. The story line and the \\"shocking\\" revelations are predictable. And, aside from the BDSM part, it's pretty much the same old scripted romance novel story line: unexperienced women who doesn't realize how beautiful she is gets swept off her feet by a womanizing cad who's somewhat effed in the head. But there's something \\"different\\" about her that changes him and makes him realize that she's not like all the other women because they are star crossed soul mates who are so in love with each other that it allows them to have sex with each other way more than would otherwise be humanly possible .<br /><br />Anyway, I tend to be a horrible literary snob, but sometimes serious and thought-provoking are too much after a long day of work and so every now and again I like to read mind-numbing (but entertaining) trash that requires very little brain power to get through and pretty much, that's what these books are.mewhat effed in the head.

0439023491|3.0|I liked the second half of the novel much more than I liked the first. The first was pretty boring. Katniss is back at District 12 and going through life. She wants Peeta to be with her, but feels like she has chosen Gale.<br /><br />I hate love triangles, especially one as badly done as this so I didn't really care much about Katniss' inner turmoil as she tried to decide which guy is right for her. If we had seen more from Gale, then I think I would have maybe understood this triangle more, but in the Hunger Games, we saw him in the beginning and in the end. Peeta was the main guy in that book and so we saw more of his feelings.<br /><br />In Catching Fire, Gale is in the beginning and end and once again Peeta is the main guy in this book. I don't really understand how we're suppose to root for Gale when we hardly know him.<br /><br />The second half of the novel is Katniss going back to the Hunger Games. I'm not going to lie, when I first saw this I was wondering why we had to do this again. But the more I read from it, the more I liked it. The allies were good and I really liked Johanna and Finnick. Both were smart and had a good head on their shoulders.<br /><br />Katniss, was a tad annoying. And Peeta was either being carried or helped in some way. He was pretty much useless.<br /><br />There was so much more that could have been done, but nothing happened until the end.<br /><br />I have a feeling that Mockingjay will be better, so I'm looking forward to that.

0439023521|5.0|Katniss Everdeen lives in district 12, the poorest district of all. These 12 districts have an annual Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a fight between 24 tributes, a girl and boy from each district who will fight till the death until one person is standing. Will Katniss get chosen to go to the Hunger Games? If she does will she live? Read this book to find out. This book is an amazing book for ages 10 and all the way until you are 100. This book is by Suzanne Collins who also wrote Gregory the Overlander Series. At moments in the book I laughed and cried. I would probably rate this book 5 stars I loved it that much. So if you like action and suspense, you will never want to put this book down.

0439023491|5.0|Collins is a genius. She reels the reader in slowly before taking over his full attention. Book 2 of The Hunger Games trilogy is phenomenal. I found mysellf sighing out loud or gasping at the appropriate parts. I was enthralled and read it in two days.  I was literally hanging off of the edge of my seat; exciting!
B004JPJHME|5.0|This movie is a classic, Johny Depp and Benicio Del Torro tear it up with many one liners and fantastic acting this movie is great! The ends crazy though
1400032717|4.0|I found this book hard to put down! I understand Haddon worked with individuals with Autism when he was younger, so his portrayal of an emotionally detatched mind is an achievement all in itself. A great mystery for people of all ages. Extremely humorous, vivid and a memorable narrative. His work is outstanding.
B005OK722U|2.0|I loved Hostel and Hostel 2, this doesn't hold a candle to either, if it wasn't called Hostel you wouldn't even know it was part of the same series. I don't think any one involved with the first 2 was involved in the production of this drivel. The whole thing takes place in one room with an audience watching and paying for different kinds of tortures to be performed on the victims, there's practically no story line or character development, it looks like it was shot with a digital camcorder, some of the gore is ok, but this doesn't have any replay value for me, it's a shame what happens to horror sequels when they hit unlucky #3 almost every time.

B000ZM1FXO|3.0|The plot relies on genre convention and the understanding that Cesar's go mad with power.  That's basically it.  For the sheer amount of nudity and death in this film, there are virtually zero sexually enticing scenes, or closeups of blood being drawn.  There is no intercourse even close to being depicted in this film.  It's so bizarre.  Lots of gaudy unrealistic sets though.<br /><br />You might think I didn't like the film, but it was actually thought provoking.  Trying to figure out the mind of Caligula (acted by A Clockwork Orange's Malcolm McDowell) was fun.  He made this movie interesting for me.  Seeing a young Helen Mirren was actually kind of terrifying... sorry Helen.
B0002VEPRQ|4.0|Really enjoyed seeing this again.  After seeing some of the artifacts from the movie in Florida, it was nice to see their original use!<br /><br />The chinmey sweep song and dance \\"Step in Time\\" is my all-time favorite out of the movie.
B0073XORLU|3.0|I remember as teenager my friend Vinny introduced me to Thick As A Brick and I thought it was an excellent piece of music.<br />I ended up purchasing the earlier Tull vinyls from the record bin. At one point I was torn between Jethro Tull or Alice Cooper as my top favorite performer. Alice won out but I still kept up w/ my Tull collection. I have purchased a number of Tull CDs to replace my vinyls which I still listen too. I actually have more Tull vinyl than CD. I honestly have to say Crest of Knave was my last favorite Tull release.<br />I miss the art work of vinyl and now dealing w/ minimal CD packaging. Plus downloading we even miss the liner notes and credits. We don't know who's playing on what and if there are any guest performers. I was hoping they would show what Gerald looks like now. I only have the CD edition so don't know if the deluxe has the lyrics in the booklet. I know Gerald Bostock is now the same age as I am and his style has grown. Of course when I say Gerald Bostock it's Ian Anderson's style has changed w/ time. TAAB2 has more of the later Tull style and I can't help but hear Heavy Horses being the returning theme. I know I won't be playing this as half as TAAB. If you like Heavy Horses, Roots To Branches or Catfish Rising then you won't be disappointed. Sequels are very hard to capture and I haven't heard any that do. Even Alice's Welcome 2 My Night was a bust. Maybe I haven't grown up and still want to be like that young Gerald Bostock or is it Holden Caulfield. But I give praise to Ian and wish him the very best. He's a very talented and gifted musician I wish I can play half the instruments he plays.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm not sure what I will be able to read after this series that would even come close.  I absolutely loved all 3 books and can honestly say that I'm gonna miss Ana and Christian.  I have gotten so attached to them over that last few days as I obsessed over reading each juicy page.  What can i say about Christian other than he was the most intriguing, deep, dark, sensitive, intelligent, arrogant, sexy, overprotective, overbearing, controlling, but most lovable character I have ever had the pleasure of meeting in a book.  I couldn't wait to see from moment to moment what he would say or do.  He was captivating, to say the very least.  Ana was a wonderful leading lady.  She too had some of the best qualities, being innocent while being sexy and adventurous, intelligent, independent and a awesome match for Christian.  The stories were engaging and the suspense, both in and out of the confines of their home, were great.  Ms.James rocked this story and this pairing was without a doubt over the top AMAZING!!!!!  I will miss them, and I am anxious to see what we can see next from Ms.James
0553386794|2.0|Perhaps the people raving about this series haven't read any other books in the genera. This book in particular is so predictable, from the get-go, that it's almost to the point of ridicule. The language is florid, yet purely ornamental. The plot is like walking through a road you've walked on many times before - unremarkably boring. The dialog and characters are cookie-cutter fantasy that pervades the genera these days. If you want to see what I mean by what I say above, read your C.S. Lewis, Tolkien, Jack Vance, Poul Anderson, heck, even Terry Goodkind for something more modern and contemporary. I just don't see what all the fanfare is about.

B0042816YK|2.0|this will be a short review. I feel Julia Roberts was miscast in the role. i usually love all her work, but she just did not fit the part, couldn't show the right expressions or feelings much of the time. And there was no chemistry between her and her hunk Javier. With so many actressess to pick from, i am sure another would have made this a decent movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|:) fun and addictive...great stress reliever.  wish I had more chances for random coins though.  would recommend to anyone wanting to kill a little time.

0393337170|2.0|There is absolutely no need to read this book if you've read [[ASIN:0393310353 Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life]].<br /><br />I'm not certain why they exist as two separate books. The content is almost identical, and 90% of the examples in this one were lifted from that. I have no idea why this is touted as a \\"sequel.\\" It is not. It's just Thinking Strategically repackaged (but I will say that its package is prettier). The tagline says that it's a \\"guide to success in business and life,\\" but it is not. It is game theory explained in an accessible way.<br /><br />I love game theory. I studied economics in college, and game theory had been my favorite class. I enjoyed Thinking Strategically and looked forward to reading this one. I was disappointed. Had I not read Thinking Strategically, I probably would have found this enjoyable, but I'm giving it two stars for the false advertising.
B0072GPPNC|2.0|First, I reeeeeeeeeeeeealy liked the movie but there is an issue with the non-Blu-ray standard packaging.  The combo Blu-ray/DVD package does not use the smaller/more compact clear-blue standard Blu-ray package, but rather the older taller DVD packaging form factor.  I have been converting my Movie library to Blu-ray for the last few years and very much like the Blu-ray form factor package.  Now this box throws off my Blu-ray library shelf.
0802798225|2.0|It is a cute story, definitely YA.  I can see why other people might have liked this book.  The plot and the story was fine.  However, the end of the story was very abrupt and it really ruined the book for me.  The h which is a character who had huge trust issues is deceived in a very public, very demeaning way by the H.  Fast-forward to almost a year later and the H and h have not had any contact with each other and he shows up out of the blue and the h and H start right back where they left off.  I'm not sure if the author just reached their page limit or what happened but as readers just being told that the H was going to build their trust again, that their relationship would no longer be of constant fighting just doesn't work.  It would have been completely out of character for the h to let someone who had hurt her as badly as the H did back into her life as though nothing happened.  No questions, no hesitation, all is wrapped up a little too fast, a little too nice.  It makes the ending seem completely unbelievable and juvenile.
B007DIQB50|5.0|The biggest problem with people & Nicki Minaj is that they feel like she's a sellout because she went from rap to pop. Truth is, she is both & that's okay. I will never understand why artists aren't allowed to venture out into new genres, why we want to keep artists in a box. The woman is doing something that no female rapper has ever done, she's a cross over female rapper & she's gone to levels female rappers never went before. This album proves that she can have the best of both worlds, she is very talented, her diversity and fearlessness is something to be admired. Most artists wouldn't dare leave their comfort zone especially a rapper. But she ventured out & did an amazing job while doing it.

B007NCT36U|5.0|I know that it changes up a bit and some people may be a bit turned off, but I love it.  I think its about time we expand the realm of hip hop a bit.  Why not infuse a bit of pop?  I think the songs are VERY CATCHY and the CD is something I can listen to again and again.  I hate buying CDs for one or two hits.  I don't get that from this album at all.  I think overall, its well done.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|Having greatly enjoyed Season 1 of Downton Abbey, I was looking forward to Season 2, and I found it as captivating and engaging as Season 1. In Season 2, the time frame is from the Battle of the Somme in 1916 to the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1919. For those unfamiliar with the series, I would advise watching Season 1 first as it provides a lot of background information on many of the characters, as well as continuity.<br /><br />The usually robust and confident Earl of Grantham(I love Hugh Bonneville's portrayal of the benevolent Earl) feels somewhat out of place this season as he yearns to be of use to his country, yet all he gets is an honorary rank in the military, and is not considered for active duty due to his age. Cora, Countess Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern) gets so caught up with the rehabilitation hospital set up in a wing of Downton that she neglects her husband which has repercussions for the Grantham's marriage. Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) is melancholic over her failed romance with Matthew Crawley and is resigned to the prospect of a marriage of convenience with another; Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) takes up driving and finds a sense of purpose in an otherwise uneventful life; and, lovely Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay) with her ideals and radical views trains as a nurse.<br /><br />The staff of Downton undergo changes of their own, and experience both ups and downs. Brendan Coyle who plays the Earl's faithful valet, John Bates, experiences some serious challenges when his estranged wife, the odious Vera (Maria Kennedy) turns up. Tom Barrow (Rob James Collier), the footman, is away at war, but finds the experience unnerving to the point that he resorts to drastic measures to make his way home.<br /><br />There is good balance between scenes at the war front and scenes at home. The battle scenes are credibly done, evoking all the fear and horror of the war. But I admit I was more interested in the machinations back home at Downton, and watching familiar and new characters resort to manipulation, scheming, and intrigues. Dowager Countess Grantham is one of my favorite characters, and Dame Maggie Smith's performance is excellent as always. This season sees further character development, not only among the main cast, but also secondary characters like the role of kitchen maid Daisy.<br /><br />This set also includes the Christmas special which is truly a stellar production. The writing is especially good, and the setting and cinematography is quite spectacular. The story flows well and the cast outdo themselves, delivering an episode not soon to be forgotten - it is quite dramatic, romantic, and just plain riveting!<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how this show is developed further in Season 3, especially in terms of what happens to some of the main characters. It is going to be difficult to exercise patience and wait for Downton Abbey Season 3!ar and new characters resort to manipulation, scheming, and intrigues.

B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie shows how anyone can go from a life seemingly destined to have a rough life on the streets to becoming very successful thanks to kindness from others.  Michael Oher just happened to become an tackle for the Baltimore Ravens.  Overall, it is an outstanding movie.  A neat part is real football coaches being in the movie, showing who actually recruited Oher, including Nick Saban while at LSU and Philip Fulmer while he was at Tennessee.  It is a must see film.
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|Great movie, I don't understand all the negative reviews. I took my 3 children age 3-9 to see it and we all loved it.
B004X80QNG|5.0|Over the weekend I finally devoted time to really learning Pocket Informant. My setup is as follows: rooted Android 2.3 Tmobile MyTouch 3G Slide phone, Outlook 2010 for Windows (not Exchange), Google calendar (for calendar items only), and Toodledo for Tasks. Outlook, under the hood, handles calendar and tasks differently, and in ways that drive 3rd party app developers crazy. That's why it's best to let ToodleDo handle tasks and Google for calendar. PI brings both together in a variety of useful displays. The sync glue that makes this all work is an arson software called gsync. It's currently costs $19 dollars. Gsync syncs Outlook tasks to ToodleDo, and PI syncs with ToodleDo (free version is all I need). Gsync syncs calendar items to Google calendar, and PI syncs with Google calendar. Gsync also handles contact syncing to Google with the phone then automatically syncing contacts from the Google cloud. For a little over $30 (PI + Gsync) you get a bullet proof sync setup--at least that's how it's been for me. I assume you already have Outlook. The PI documentation could be better but spend a few minutes experimenting with PI and you'll do fine. One other recommendation is to get the Outlook 2010<br />GTD Setup document from the David Allen website. This doc really helped me implement GTD on both Outlook and PI. The danger any GTD developer faces is dealing with the abundance of engineering type personalities that GTD attracts. They all think a GTD product is lacking because it doesn't include every obscure feature under the sun. Same reaction if they need to combine one product with another at an additional cost e.g. PI with Gsync. You can endlessly spend your time trying to create that perfect GTD setup (I've been there), or you can start using the combination of tools as I've outlined and avoid getting stuck in a tweaking morass. Hopefully I don't come across as a shill for any of these products. Rather I wanted to outline my GTD solution that's working well for me. I have not tried PI on my Kindle Fire yet.

B000007ODY|5.0|It's taken years for me to appreciate the Brahms symphonies. I've always loved the piano concertos and violin concerto, but somehow the symphonies always seemed less tuneful and passionate to me. My opinion hasn't changed in that regard; however, these symphonies contain a world of beautiful and effective music - I like them. The recordings I have previously listened to were primarily BBC productions. (BBC Music Magazine). BBC performances tend to be dull, stodgy, and rather gutless - I think it's a British thing. Anyway, these performances are gorgeous, well-played, and well-recorded. I can find no technical issues with the recordings whatsoever, despite common complaints from listeners concerning DG engineering in that era. If you want Brahms symphonies, I don't think you can beat these renditions - especially at this budget price.
0439023513|1.0|The book feels like the author had a deadline to make and could not come up with the content the series deserved.  There is only one part that effects me and it has to do with the flea bag cat and Katniss.  I can see what the author was trying to do and she totally missed the mark with this book.  It makes me sad that the last book left me feeling almost nothing for the rest of the series. I expected characters to die, lets face it people have been killed left and right in these books, but the content was not there.  I wish the author could rewrite this book and make it better.  It makes me sad to feel this way about a book that had so much potential.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Asus prime game is fun when it functions. Get almost to end of level constantly freezes very frustrating. Please update
3836501910|2.0|While I do think this book is a great deal at around $14, I found the content underwhelming. Imagine if a kind of slimy quasi-celeb in Hollywood had a series of drug/sex parties and someone walked around with a camera taking pics of the the men's  equipment and caught a few couples doing sleazy stuff. Then various girls posed and showed their boobs, a few pornstars came by and blew some guys, and the host took more pics of his Johnson. Some of the guests clowned around with props and did silly stuff naked, all captured on film. Then you would have the pics in this book. The only thing I can say for Terry is that he's taken some of the best pics of Lindsay Lohan I've seen. But there is nothing approaching that quality in this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|just like the original card game! Glad you cannot cheat like some versions. Love the Colors of the layout too they are easy on the eyes
B007MU85D0|5.0|The UK version of this album came out about 6 months ago, so I've been pimping it to my friends ever since then, waiting for it to be finally released in the states.<br /><br />This Icelandic band has a rare combination of excellent instrumental talent, song-writing ability, and vocal harmony.  The male and female lead vocalists blend together beautifully and give every track a unique duet sound.  They use a wide variety of acoustic instruments, but have no problem changing speeds or volume, making for a nice variety of slow, quiet songs, and louder, up-beat songs, and some that transition flawlessly between the two.<br /><br />My favorite track on the album is 'Lakehouse', followed closely by 'Six Weeks', 'King and Lionheart', and the alt-rock hit 'Little Talks'.  If you are a fan of upbeat folk, such as Mumford & Sons, this album will be right in your wheelhouse.  My only disappointment was that they left the poppy track 'Numb Bears' off the US release, but if you dig hard enough you can probably find elsewhere.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My husband and I read these books together and really enjoyed the story. I usually read paranormal romance books and he reads non-fiction about social justice. Although we both loved the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />What we liked: The social commentary about death and reality tv. The characters in the story (through all three books) are really impacted with the fact that they have killed someone. It haunts them. I thought the author really emphasized the idea that these are children making adult decisions and thrown into adult situations and its not good for their brains and emotions.<br /><br />What we didn't like: Katniss whines a lot. Which seems to be typical of a teenage girl but sometimes it was really hard to read because she takes everything so personally and everything is about her all the time. Very teenage girl... it just got old.<br /><br />Overall we enjoyed the books and dont like to see them compared to twilight because the story is not about the love triangle, although there is one in the story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a very nice Bible app. It includes many different versions of the Bible, several with accompaning audio readings, as well as a variaty of reading plans to choose from.
B0072GPQNG|1.0|I had high hopes for this film, especially since Steven Spielberg made it. Unfortunately this is his worst film. From start to finish it is a failure. If we split it into three parts, the beginning is boring, the ending is sappy, and as for the middle, there is no plot, no story. Half way through the film it mentions the brave carrier messenger pigeons used in WWI to delivery military secrets, and I was hoping that Spielberg had finally stumbled onto a good story. Following the plight of the pigeons would have at least made this a film with a story. If Spielberg was trying to make a great World War One film, he produced a monumental failure. If he was attempting to make a great film about a man and his horse, he missed the mark completely. Indeed, if you want a great film about WWI and horses, then get the true action film from 1985: The Lighthorsemen. As for me, I will no longer buy a Spielberg film just because his name is on it. He use to be a great film maker. We will have to wait and see if he can earn that respect again.
B006ON41FC|3.0|this app is okay but gets pointless after playing a few rounds. I got this app on the free app of the day but if I didn't get it for free. I would not pay 1 dollar!

B0052U59F4|5.0|WOW! I have been telling everyone I know about this book. (At least the ones I know would be able to handle some steamy love scenes and a little spice in their life!) I loved this series of books so much that I read them twice. The first time reading them I read so quickly that felt like I needed to go back and reread to make sure I didn't miss anything.<br />WARNING! If you have a busy day or week, don't start it until you can devote some time. You will not want to put any of the books down. You will stay awake until you can't keep your eyes open. You will want to ignore everything around you because you will be consumed with this great story!
0812550706|5.0|Science fiction is usually a genre I shy away from, mainly because the majority of science fiction novels are cliché, cheesy stories that have all been told before, however Ender's Game has been recommended to me multiple times and all reviews that I saw were positive so I decided to give the genre another try. The book grabbed my attention from page 1 and held it for the entire novel. The first chapter was excellently written and set up Ender's character. The concept of compassion and the contrast to violence and anger is set up from the first chapter and was the main theme to me. Not only is this novel highly entertaining, but it has good themes laced into it. The book is not an easy read, however; not because of the language, but because you empathize with Ender when he is put through all the rough trials in Battle School. He is incessantly bullied by his peers and his teachers and this is hard to read without feeling sympathy for him; this is exactly what a book is supposed to do, make you empathize with the character, make you care about what happens to him. Many books fall short on this aspect, but Card does an excellent job. Enders's game is easily the best science fiction novel I have ever read and is, so far, the best book I've read this year; it easily earns my stamp of approval and I give it a 5/5.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I just finished this book- my face is damp from all the tears I just let fall.  Good lord Colleen!  This book was BEAUTIFUL!  I'm really not sure what else to say, or how else to describe it.<br />It was a story about love, loss, life, grieving, moving on, accepting, relationships, sacrifice, love, love and did I mention love?  :)<br />This story flowed well- was written very naturally and had GREAT characters. All of them!<br />This book was truly beautiful.  I can't wait to read the next one.
B006LEHOL2|4.0|I really like this album. I heard Queen of Denmark on the local NPR radio channel and laughed out loud. It's good, her version is as good as the original. The album starts out with a jaunty 4th and Vine and the serious Reason with Me and just gets better.  My favorite of her older material is Am I Not Your Girl. I like that type of music anyway and it's not easy to sing. She has a beautiful voice and I feel she could have done a little better but you know it's still very , very good. Not really complaining and the more I listen the more I like it. She's a very sensitive person and the BS of our world is very oppressive to her.  I kind of lost touch with her recordings for many years. I'm glad she recorded this, it's very emotional and it touches me deeply. How About I be Me and You be You, isn't that a novel idea?

6305736650|5.0|Truly a great movie. To borrow from Milton, this film asks whether it's better to rule in Hell or to serve in Heaven. Bogart's character had an opportunity for either, and the choice is his.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A great popular game for kindle fires. Just add the surf and turf Cu's I've heard a lot about it lately.
B0073XORCY|5.0|I have to admit I cringed when I first heard Ian announce that he would be releasing a follow up to Thick as a Brick.  I thought he was crazy ... no way he could pull this off.  Well, I am still in amazement that he pulled off this gem.  The songs just grow and grow on you.  I haven't cared much for the Tull albums of the past 15 years.  I thought his solo albums were good, but not great.  This piece blows them all away.  It's the most creative work he has put out in decades.  The lyrics are fantastic, as is the musicianship.  There is a fantastic flow to the songs.  Just when it seems there may be a lull, it perks up perfectly.  This is just a wonderful album.  I can't imagine any Tull fan who takes the time to listen closely (especially on the 5.1 DVD!), will in any way be disappointed with this wonderful work by the one-of-a-kind Ian Anderson.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I am a fan of the Renaissance era and these books do not disappoint.  The show on HBO follows the books very closely, which is good.  I hope that there are more books to follow.
B0054W4JQK|3.0|The beginning of this book is cleverly written and quite gripping.  It could have been an excellent story, but lacked imagination at the three-quarter point.<br />It was not a long book, but I was very disappointed with the silly turn it took and the eventual outcome was all too predictable.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|***Light spoilers***<br /><br />Finished book 2 and it continued the story with much interest for me. At first I thought, Ana went back to Christian way too easily, but as the story progressed it needed to happen. I did find that the conflict that Ms. James puts into her books seems to be glossed over. The whole thing with Leila ended too neatly and the reader could feel that the situation with Jack was resolved efficiently. (Although we do see in the end that it wasn't wrapped up as neatly as we had thought). A good spring board for book 3.<br />Christian has come so far in his develpment from Book 1. I can truly see Ana as his therapy. This has truly turned into a love story and I cannot wait to see Ana and Christian get their happily ever after.

B005LAIH3G|4.0|Went to see this movie with little to no expectations in hopes that I would be impressed and needless to say, I was.  This is probably my favorite movie of 2012 so far.  What really pisses me off is that this movie didn't do well at the box office and yet the hunger games is still number 1....That movie was not all that great.

B00005214X|5.0|After watching the HBO documentary on George Harrison, I was moved to purchase this double-CD.  It will be in my music collection forever.  The song \\"What Is Life\\" is one of the best love songs to God, creation, the whole she-bang ever written.<br /><br />RIP, George.  Can't wait to meet you and jam with you.
B0073XORCY|4.0|I got into Tull when I was in sixth grade, shortly after \\"Underwraps\\" was released.  Any Tull album prior to \\"Underwraps,\\" I've always loved upon the first play.  With the exception of \\"A.\\"  Finally, on the 794th listen, I finally realized what a great album \\"A\\" was.  All the songs a winner? No; such as \\"4W.D. (Low Ratio)\\" and \\"Batteries Not Included\\".  But \\"Cross Fire,\\" Flysdale Flier,\\" \\"Pine Martin's Jig,\\" \\"Black Sunday,\\" etc., just great.  Maybe would have been a better received album if done with the \\"Storm Watch\\" band (meaning, with fewer electronics and more acoustic instruments).  But anyway, some I've liked more than others, but I just think they're all fantastic albums.<br /><br />But anything after \\"Underwraps,\\" I've always had to listen a few times.  In most cases, I've fallen in love with the album; but in some cases, I just can't get into them (Catfish Rising, \\"Roots to Branches, dot com).  All three albums have their moments; I think \\"Rocks on the Road\\" is one of the all time great Tull songs, as is \\"When Jesus Came to Play.\\"  And this goes for Anderson's solo albums as well.<br /><br />Anyway, to get to the point and apologies for the tangent, I just really like TaaB2.  From the first listen, I just really liked it.  Which hasn't happened in a long time for me with a Tull/Anderson album.  I haven't had to re-listen to it several times to enjoy.<br /><br />It was the feel of the 70's Tull, as well as \\"Secret Language of Birds\\" and \\"Rupi's Dance.\\"  It seems like a perfect combination/amalgamation of the classic Tull and what Anderson's been doing for the past few years.  It has some nods to the original, but not too many to be gratuitous.  It is really to me the perfect musical sequel.  Enough connections to the original work to make you know it is a continuation, but not too many that it simply doesn't feel like a rehash.  All in all, just a really great release.
B0053KWDES|1.0|FiiO E11 has just quit working and I've owned it less than four months.. Will not re-charge. It's dead and useless.

B001E45XT4|5.0|I'm pretty fussy when it comes to headsets, and I must say this one is one of the best I've had, it is great. I thought that they would be too heavy when I took them out of the package but they sit very comfortably and have a nice big pad on the top.<br /><br />And previous reviewers are right...I bought a well-reviewed Fiio E3 Headphone Amp for cheap on Amazon, it was only $7.50, and tried that and WOWWWW these things just ROCK with that little amp, I had the EQ cranked way up in Itunes with the high side way down and it was way loud and clear as a bell. Pushed up the highs to 3/4 and still no distortion and lots louder. I definitely recommend one of the headphone amps for maximum enjoyment with this headset...note though that they are GREAT without one but with one I was like...Whoaaaa this is great, played I Drink Alone by George T. and Smokin' and I Ain't the One (Lynyrd Skynyrd) to test, cranked all the way and no distortion at all. I'm running sound through an iMic, also highly recommended.<br /><br />I usually don't give 5 star reviews, but this headset is well worth the cheap sale price at 22 bucks, it's worth at least twice as much, I'm sure it rivals a lot of $200 headsets out there.
B005LAIGLO|2.0|I see a few reviews here mentioning alot of action, and excitement. I wonder if i saw a different film. As a fan of Mark's i wanted to like this movie, but it was tepid at best, it kept building up and failed to deliver, and it had me and my date yawning by the end (she is a die hard Mark fan, and we went to see this because she swoons over him)<br /><br />I would catch it at redbox, and not waste adding it to my collection.

B003KRJNBW|5.0|I am not one to easily praise a movie. It is very difficult for a movie to make my list. My list being a list of the greatest movies of ever. There had been 11 movies on this list. There are now 12.<br /><br />The book of Eli is one of the greatest movies ever. The overall message astounds, the ending is beautiful and brilliant, the acting is superb, the costuming and make up are exquisite, the action is thrilling and perfectly executed, and the set is spot on. There is not a flaw in this movie. You will be hooked within the first 5 minutes.<br /><br />Though this movie is not for a young audience, every one should see this movie at some point in her or her life. go in with an open mind and see where it can take you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I finished the Hunger Games in a week and Catching Fire in three days.  I couldn't put it down.  Every extra minute of the day I'd pick it back up and get through another chapter or two.<br /><br />This book picks up exactly where the first one ends.  You think they'll be somewhat happy but with what happened at the end of the first book you know that isn't so.  This book goes very fast.  There's always something going on behind the scenes and I found myself trying to figure it out but just like the previous book, there's that one scenario you never would of imagined and BAM! that's what happens.  This is a page turner and unless you want to walk around complaining you want to get back to reading, carve out time to really enjoy this book!<br /><br />I'm downloading the third book immediately since I can't wait to find out what really happens to Distict 12......or what was District 12..........<br /><br />Great book!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Thanks to this very credible book, and of course, its author--many thanks, sir--I've dropped over forty pounds and am still dropping. This will be the hard part for some folks to understand, I've done it without exercising.  Why no exercising? Because I am disabled from a massive hemorrhagic stroke. I could not even walk more than ten feet without having to flop back down in my wheelchair.  Yesterday, because of the inclement weather in the Fort Worth/Dallas area (12 tornadoes!) I decided to try to walk to my doctor's office. I made it! Incredibly enough, I am losing at a rate of four pounds a week. I'm under the care of a physician because of multiple health challenges, pain being problem number one.<br /><br />I had lost 20 by being very calorie conscious. However it took a YEAR to lose that little poundage.  I had no idea that the \\"wheat\\" that is being peddled as wheat is NOT what I ate as a young girl.  All of the \\"experts\\" say that women can't lose weight as easily as a man. That is true...except for this new way of eating.  To me, this is no \\"diet,\\" it is a new way of eating and since it permits me to eat foods I love, what's the problem?<br /><br />I have another 50 or so pounds or so, but the BIG problem now is that nothing fits me...when this woman says she has nothing to wear, she really MEANS it.  While in the parking lot at my local Target, my pants fell off me!  Thankfully, I was between two cars when they did that little trick. Fortunately, I have a great sense of humor, but it could have been embarrassing.<br /><br />Although the book is rather thin on recopies, I've been a scratch cook for decades.  I hope he will come up with a recipe book but for heaven's sake use only products that one can find all over the world, not just at specialty or Asian food stores. Ground flaxseed from Red Mill is easy to find without having to pay through the nose at a health food store.<br /><br />I have cheated a few times without negative effects, however I don't make a habit of it.  There's nothing like a Swiss cheese omelet for breakfast. I don't even miss the toast.<br /><br />Bottom Line: But this book and FOLLOW IT.  If you hit a plateau, don't sweat it, it will be for a relatively short period of time and you'll be on your way to dropping weight and girth again.<br /><br />The only problem I'm going to have is going through Passover without eating matzoh. As part of the stroke I had, most all of my teeth shattered and broken. I have no opposing teeth, so it's \\"fun\\" trying to eat something hard...made with wheat.  I'm 71 years YOUNG and must live to be at least 100 because I have so many doctors to bury.a habit of it.  There's nothing like a Swiss cheese omelet for breakfast.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'll admit it's taken me a long time to read this book.  I didn't want to get wrapped up in the hype and to be honest the subject matter didn't exactly appeal to me.  I've been reading the reviews for a year deciding if I should take the plunge and read this book.  All I really knew about it was that kids were put into an arena and fought to their death until only one survived.  Not exactly bed-time reading and an enjoyable book to get into.<br /><br />Now, being an adult I'm sure I have a whole different opinion about this book than your average teen does.  I started reading The Hunger Games and finished the first one in a week.  I even downloaded the second one and read that one in three days!  Now I see why people have read this book.<br /><br />I'm not going to say it's all fun and games.  There's a lot of violence and if you are kind of queezy and find the subject matter difficult this isn't the book for you.  Yes, it's about kids killing each other but when you get past that part it's a book about control - government control.  I don't want to give the entire thing away and from some of the other reviews there are pretty detailed descriptions of this book.<br /><br />This is a very good book.  It's a pretty quick read and will keep you thinking about it after you're finished.<br /><br />One last thing that doesn't have to do with this book.  I've found the reviews of other readers as a great temperature gauge in making my decision to read or not to read The Hunger Games.  When I'm selecting a book to read I very seldom read what critics write but always read what other reader's have written.

B000002KAT|5.0|- and here I have plenty of company, apparently.  While the Moondance album and various greatest hits compendiums are fine as an intro to Van Morrison, this is surely his richest and most substantial album.  I would like to think that 'music appreciation' classes in high schools have progressed and now include more recent music (the past 50 years or so).  This should be in there - along with other pop masterpieces, to be sure.  Maybe other posters know something about this.
1853262390|2.0|For all dyed-in-the-wool Virginia Woolf fans, my review will be anathema.  People who review books often review the ones they love especially, but I review each one, good or bad.  I started this novel in high hopes.  I had never read the famous British author and I looked forward to a special treat.  The background to the rich and handsome Orlando seemed promising, his adventures interesting, but then weirdness grew and became overpowering.  I didn't mind that he turned into a woman, but even so, whatever the sex of the protagonist, we need a plot in the novel.  The descriptions of his doings seemed less and less relevant, his/her gender fluctuations assumed more and more importance, and I finally decided that I just didn't care.  What I really didn't like about ORLANDO is that there is a sub-text, closed to those of us of this day and age, who are not privy to the intimate doings of the Bloomsbury set, who did not sit together with V. Woolf and listen to her read her latest chapters, chuckling knowingly as they recognized the models for the various characters.  I felt excluded.  And why would I read a novel from which I was excluded ?  Well, the answer, dear reader, is that I wouldn't.  And I don't recommend that you do either.<br /><br />People tell me that Woolf's other novels are much better and of a different type.  So, I am not condemning the writer, only the book.  And, OK, maybe you will like it.  But don't say I didn't warn you.
0062124293|5.0|Here's the deal - Caitlin Moran drops a ton of F bombs through out the book. There are a lot of discussions  of female body parts, but not the terminology  your gynecologist would use - at least not with a patient.<br />If foul language and graphic sex talk bothers you, stay away from this book.<br /><br />Caitlin Moran [[ASIN:0091940745 How to Be a Woman. Caitlin Moran]] is brilliant and hilarious. M's Moran writes as if she's catching up with you after a long absence. And she writes what I believe to be truth.<br />For instance, one of my favorite quotes has to do with whether you are a feminist or not. It boils down to two simple questions - \\"do you have a vagina? Do you want to be in charge of it?\\" If the answer is \\"yes\\" to both questions, you are a feminist.<br /><br />M's Moran's story about getting her first period was similar to my own experience. She doesn't buy into the whole \\"now you are a woman\\" garbage. She talks about growing up the oldest of eight children in a small crowded house. And it is funny - sometimes funny painful and sometimes it's just funny.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly to any woman who is not likely to be put off by the language. It is a terrific, quick read.<br /><br />_enjoy_

I was about to give up because it is about human misery and poverty and that kind of stuff breaks my heart but I thought I will read a bit further. Well, once I got to reading a bit further, I could not put it down. I could not go to sleep until I finished the book at 5 AM in the morning. Good thing it was a Saturday and I did not have to go to work that morning.<br /><br />If you are looking for comfort, this is not the book for you, but boy is it riveting! Since I read it which was the past weekend, I have read part II and am now reading part III. I will finish the last book and then go watch the movie in the theater.

Most other books, I have tried to read, I find the language to confunsing or find myself unable to hold on to details. This book however was a very easy read with powerful vivid language.  Some of the plot twist and turns I found to be a little too predicatable, but overall I found myself full of curiousity with what was going to happen to Katniss and Peeta next and how she would respond.  The story line was so good I ended up reading all three books.

He explores the benefits, and limitations that checklists bring (or can bring) to our daily lives. This is a great book for anyone who provides care for patients. As a nurse, I was taught to memorize everything, throughout school I kept wondering why I couldn't make a list of the steps I needed to do and have it available, so I could make sure I did everything...but we are supposed to rely on our faulty memories instead. You can also check out some videos he developed with the WHO on how to use the pre-surgical checklist on YouTube.
B000066C6F|5.0|Ultimately critics of the movie 'Perfect' may well come to understand this film as I came to see it upon walking out of the theater on opening night: not as a relic of mid-80's cheese and bad script writing, but actually as a stunning artistic career exploration that may well be regarded as the fait d'accompli of the Travolta opus!! Let me explain.<br /><br />You must challenge yourself to go back to that very uncomfortable period of time (those old enough to remember), to the time between the disco-studded leisure suit success of Travolta's early years and the action-packed genre of his most recent blow up/shoot em up flicks. In this inter-modal time period you will find a self-doubting Travolta who most people believed - as did the illuminati of the East Coast entertainment media - that he was at the nadir of his career. His entourage had long since abandoned him. Entertainment writers (to the degree they paid any attention at all to this fading 70's icon) panned his every move. His agent wasn't calling him back, and choice male lead roles were going to the likes of Stallone and the puerile Tom Cruise. So Travolta probably figured, why accept these infantile roles that are unpalatable and fake to begin with? Why not strike it out on his own and do the signature roles he was afraid to tell his agent he really wanted to pursue? And what emerged from this burst of artistic self indulgence were instant classic films like 'Look Who's Talking' and 'Look Who's Talking 2'. He wasn't being pushed by some Hollywood big shot to sign on to the next blood bath (ala Stalone) or coerced by the love-starved public to prostrate himself upon the alter of a tweener romance (ala Cruise). It is within this context that we find the movie 'Perfect'. In other words...it is the rarest, purest form of an unadulterated, unpretentiousness John Travolta you will ever see committed to celluloid. It is the un-Tom Cruise. And it is very revealing.<br /><br />In 'Perfect' Travolta plays a hard bitten reporter pursing a story on, of all things, health clubs. He encounters Jaime Lee Curtis, who doesn't immediately fall for his machismo charms, but you just know she will be incapable of resisting by about minute 63. So you know what he has to do. Go undercover. Deep undercover. His aim: to explore the health club sub-culture, burn some joules of energy and win the girl. Along the way, of course, we're treated to a masculinity redefining experience of Travolta in aerobic tights that challenges every viewer - man or woman, gay or straight - to experience the maximum threshold of uncomfortablilty known to human kind. It's off the charts. Dear reader, are you not seeing through this paper thin veil of a plot to the deeper interior? Come with me through the looking glass. This is what Edgar Allan Poe called, \\"the hideous dropping off of the veil.\\" For it is within this plot that we find Travolta crying out for acceptance, to be loved once more as a Danny Zuco or the guy he played in Saturday Night Fever, but not really knowing how to go back there. His only recourse is to make US - you and I the viewing public- see ourselves in his character, to experience the comfortableness that must surely be the province of an actor at the cross roads of his career. Yet, it is only by exploring this character was Travolta able to emerge from it new and introspective, to draw new courage for the next phase of his career.<br /><br />Have we judged Travolta too harshly in this movie? I suspect so. \\"Travolta in tights\\" is all we heard from the critic (yes singular - there just weren't that many critics back then). They said it would be his last pic. They were already writing the obit on his career. They didn't know at the time that Travolta was already picking out fabric swatches for the interior of his G5, that he had his sights set on reclaiming his place atop the list of Hollywood A-listers. While we were laughing at him dancing around making ridiculous contortions on the studiofloor, he was looking back into that camera mind banging us.<br /><br />Definately time for the studio to release the Blu-Ray version. Maybe in time for the 30th anniversary. Here's to John Travolta who must certainly be considered for a place atop the pantheon of aerobic greatness along side Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons. And to an even greater accomplishment by crossing the doldrums of his career and emerging even stronger thanks to critical roles in movies like 'Perfect'.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The ending of this book was final.  I read the first book in 2 weeks.  I read the second book in a week.  This book I read in two days. When I read this book I didn't get hungry, I didn't get thirsty, all I wanted to do was read.  This is by far the best book in the series.  More action, more vivid pictures, and just sheer curiousity sucks you in every step of the way.  I was very happy to find the ending to be final.  No chance for a fourth book that could ruin the story.  These books are so good I may read them again.

B000FCKPHG|3.0|I read an article on Wired that mentioned this book: [...]    Then I read the book.    The book is very interesting and detailed, but it's just an extension of what the article already made clear: the way you think can deeply change how you learn, how you perform and how you grow in all aspects of life. If you keep a fixed mindset you will limit yourself greatly. Better fail and learn from failures than not trying.    And that's pretty much the whole book in a nutshell.    I also wanted to have seen more of the science. Not that there wasn't any, but I found that sometimes it wasn't clear if the author really assessed all the people she describes in the book for their mindset or if she judged them by how they behaved. For example, did she test the tennis player with the fixed mindset or is she just asserting that he had that mindset based on his behavior?    Anyway, it's a good book, I don't want to dismiss it. Just saying it's a book about one simple idea and one idea only.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|First of all, its a good read and gives some insight intothe skill, intensity, and sacrafices made by Jobs.  a great read for any in the software or product business  Also a warning signpost or the cost of such personal sacrafice on family and friends.<br /><br />BUT, its als a bit white washed.  Jobs was blind sided and nearly bankrupted by the wintel duopoly, and then again by NeXT.  Pixar was also much  closer to disaster than this book indicates.  That shouldnt detract from the obvious talents of Jobs at all, but the absence of such epic losses and near-misses does whitewash the book to see Jobs as a technology &#34;Jesus&#34; figure, which he was not.<br /><br />so, read and learn, but dont swallow it whole.

At the very begining there is a message that tells you this film was not intended for 3 d but convert to 3 d(only a few scenes are 3d). The 3 d quality on the certain scenes are good however, the rest of the film is a big disappointment. In  my honest opinion I would not have  purchased it.

0439023521|4.0|I have had this book gathering dust on my shelf for an obscene amount of time. In truth, I put off reading it because there are so many other books on my \\"To Read\\" list & when a push back happens, it's the YA novels that take it for the team. I'm glad to say that this was very much worth the read.<br /><br />I know that everything to be said about this book & the entire series has likely been said, but I cannot let it go without saying that what struck me most & I find I am most interested in is, the Capitol, its inhabitants & how this entire society has devolved into this place we're transported too. Katniss as the narrator, took my breath away sometimes because she had a way of relating the matter-of-factness of some things & a seeming complacency for others. She could see inherent unfairness in the way things were set up to the advantage of the Capitol but didn't seem to bear any in her own district for not being the sorts to band together & offer assistance to one another in dire situations (her family almost starved to death when her father died & she knows that others have met that same fate). It struck me as an interesting study in \\"Us vs. Them\\". The same is touched on with the Avox girl, that Katniss recognizes.<br /><br />Panem is a rough place all around. The feeling of helplessness is used as a weapon to wear people down & fear is used to keep people in their own district & not inclined to venture out to others for information or banding together. The Capitol must have great intimidation PR because the fences aren't electrified 24/7 but people haven't crossed in masses to meet.<br /><br />As to the games themselves, I admit to feeling uneasy as I read this because I felt like a spectator (& of course that's the point). But, I am not a watcher of reality television. I haven't the fortitude for it. It makes me nervous, uncomfortable & I have a tendency to feel embarrassed for others & like I'm seeing something I shouldn't. Simply put, I'm an atrocious gawker. I don't want to see humanity at its worst & the idea of the Hunger Games or Flesh Fair (from the film A.I.) all playing out while people sit and watch, placing bets & having parties nags at my psyche.

B007KSVYA0|5.0|Initially, upon seeing this special feature that Amazon had for Mad Men fans on success in business, I did not know what to expect. Following actually watching the video I have been pleasantly surprised to say the least.<br /><br />The video delves into a number of key features that leaders in business possess and qualities that one can express to rise in influence while gaining the trust of fellow co-workers. I found the information invaluable for someone already in a particular industry or looking to make their mark into the business world. These traits are described by industry experts who touch on the qualities with personal examples of their own. The traits are then exhibited by scenes that have taken place within the first four seasons of mad men.<br /><br />To say that I have learned a lot in this video is quite the understatement. A definite must see if you are looking to improve yourself as an individual and gain insight into what defines success and how to become the success you desire.<br /><br />This is a special feature and not an episode. Thus, it should be judged as such.

1613822634|5.0|\\"Handsome, clever and rich\\" is how Emma is introduced to us, and a happy, carefree existence she leads, with very little to worry her other than idle gossip. The youngest of two sisters, Emma lives alone with her father, doting on him, after her sister Isabella marries. Their mother is long deceased, and Emma has grown up with a kindly governess, Miss Taylor, who bestows strong motherly affection on her.<br />Set in 18th century rural England, the novel affords us a picturesque, detailed view of the daily tenets of English life at the time, complete with carriages, gowns, housekeepers and social traditions. Austen weaves a delicious web of Emma's life and that of her friends in Highbury, where they live. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, is a gentle, kind man with an excessively considerate compassion to others that often borders on paranoia. He is constantly afraid of catching cold, or falling ill, and lectures those around him incessantly on the need for precaution. We learn of Mr. Knightley, a long-time, close neighbor of the family, whose brother is married to Isabella, and of the Westons, Bates, and Perrys, all families of the area, as they intermingle in Emma's world.<br />Harriet, a girl of less social advantage, is taken by Emma under her wing. Emma's favorite hobby is matchmaking, and we watch her make one blunder after the next to poor Harriet. When Robert Martin, a young farmer, proposes to her friend, Emma retaliates very sharply, advising Harriet against marrying him and \\"falling into lower circumstance.\\" Harriet is miserable, but appears to be convinced. Mr. Knightley, ever present in Emma's life and home, scolds her sharply for her interference, but Emma stands her ground defiantly, insisting that she knows what is best for Harriet.<br />When a Mr. Elton appears on the scene, pouring lavish attentions onto them, Emma is convinced of his being far superior to Mr. Martin, and does all in her power to coax Harriet into returning his feelings. All the while,she is smugly telling Mr. Knightley that she predicts a far better outcome for her friend than his preference of Mr. Martin. Harriet becomes attached to Mr. Elton, and all is going to plan, when Emma receives a tumultuous shock: Mr. Elton asks for her own hand in marriage. Emma, horrified, asks him about his feelings for Harriet, but he denies vehemently, saying that all his advances were meant towards Emma! Our heroine then sinks into utter guilt and mortification, watching Harriet's heart break due to her own wheedling and landing her in this mess.<br />Mr. Elton wastes no time; he soon marries another rich woman, obviously keen to secure a fortune. Meanwhile, Emma's attention is caught by Mr. Frank Churchill, a recent arrival to Highbury, but she comfortably assures herself of her immunity to love and marriage. She flirts with him, but does not entertain any serious ideas towards him--only to find herself duped, again, when his secret engagement to her neighbor is revealed.<br />Overwhelmed by all her blunders, Emma is feeling a great deal of confusion and remorse, but there is a final blow that she is unprepared for. Out of the blue, Harriet shares her new feelings for Mr. Knightley with her, and her hope that these feelings may be returned.<br />Emma's world crashes at that moment. She panics and feels extremely agitated, which suddenly leads her to realize her own love for Mr. Knightley, a love unknown and unacknowledged by her. As she stares into herself, she reflects on his constant presence in her life, her attachment to him, her extreme care for his opinion. The thought of losing him is too painful to bear, and Emma, for the first time in the story, is plunged into total misery. But the tables turn yet again. As she awaits his breaking the news to her, of his attachment to Harriet, Mr. Knightley comes forth with a powerful declaration of love for Emma, a love he has had for years. In a very touching scene that causes the reader's heart to soar, Mr. Knightley, normally not a man of many words, pours his feelings to Emma in anguish. He asks her to marry him, with a pained conviction that he will be refused. Emma is overjoyed, assures his troubles away, accepts without a second thought.<br />Amidst her shock, and just as she is dealing with the conflicting emotions of her own extreme happiness, and great mortification for Harriet, Mr. Knightley saves the day by encouraging Mr. Martin to approach Harriet again. The girl's feelings for him, which had never ceased, finally prevail, and the couple are united.<br />Despite her haughty airs and egotism, Emma is \\"faultless despite all her faults\\" in the eyes of Mr. Knightley, and we can't help liking her, too, for she is always trying to do good, and her heart is in the right place. Mr. Knightley himself, kind, generous, sincere and honorable--a close reminder of Mr. Darcy--wins us over, and we breathlessly wait for things to work out between him and Emma. The author, with a remarkable talent for making us hold our breath, turning the tables and providing unexpected turns, concludes the book with happy endings for all, leaving us smiling.<br />Austen's language, two centuries ago, is as delicious as the novel itself, the quaint writing taking us on a foray into older English and its idioms, structures and expressions. One of my favorite novels, Emma is a delight to read, from start to finish, and a story that captivates the imagination right until the last page.

0525423656|2.0|In Crossed, the sequel to Ally Condie's Matched, the story picks up to where the reader left off. Ky is working in a labor camp in the Outer Provinces and Cassia is getting moved around every couple of months on work assignments. Both characters are desperate to find each other. When Cassia gets transported to the Outer Provinces, she is hopeful that she will finally be able to find Ky. However, she finds that he has run away from the labor camp and has disappeared into dangerous and mysterious canyons, where the members of the resistance are rumored to be living. Cassia is invested in finding Ky, as well as joining the Rising that supposedly lives in the canyon. However, Ky, while desperate to find Cassia, is reluctant to join the Rising because of his own past.<br /><br />To get the perspectives of Cassia and Ky, the narration switches from Cassia to Ky every chapter. Sometimes I found this a little bit confusing, because both sounded incredibly similar. I frequently had to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see who's POV I was reading. However, the upside to this is that as a reader you can get into the heads of both Cassia and Ky. Both characters provide different insights into not only themselves but also the secondary characters. For example, Xander only appears once in the book, but he is mentioned throughout as both characters think about him. Thus, trying to keep the love triangle alive. Ky knows a secret that Xander shares, but is unwilling to share it with Cassia. Other characters that are introduced include Vick, Eli,a boy who reminds Ky and Cassia of Bram, and Indie, a girl who Ky does not quite trust.<br /><br />This book suffers from what I call The Sequel Disappointment. There is always so much anticipation of when the sequel comes out, that it is hard to read the sequel and have it be as Knock-Your-Socks-Off good as its predecessor. I am not sure whether it is the anticipation, the standard of the first book, or what, but I was disappointedwith this book. It can be noted that The Sequel Disappointment is also a close relative to the Book to Movie Paradigm.<br /><br />Crossed for me was just very slow from the beginning. Both characters are in the desert pining for each other, which frankly just does not move the plot forwards. The first two hundred pages of the book is about Ky and Cassia looking for each other in the desert. It gets old fast. Like sands in the hourglass, nobody wants to endure long periods of time watching that. There were several opportunities for action or plot thickening, however, they action was told and not described and they were cut short. The characters had something that they both wanted, but because of the chopped nature of the potential actions sequences, there was not overarching tension to pull the plot along. There are a couple of last minute attempts of surprise later in the book, but at that point it is a bit too little, too late.<br /><br />To conclude, Crossed does not live up to Matched. It is yet another disappointing sequel that generates very little excitement or reasons to keep reading.
B0073XORLU|5.0|Jethro Tull singer/songwriter Ian Anderson's new solo album Thick As a Brick 2 (or TAAB 2 as he calls it) is a must for Jethro Tull fans.<br />Having been a fan of the original 1972 Jethro Tull classic Thick As a Brick (which became the band's first US #1 album in 1972 upon its release) since I first heard the album on the radio back in the 1990s (and my reason I got into Jethro Tull's music), I was surprised that a sequel to the classic album was coming out earlier this year. Then when I saw it was to be released as a solo album from Ian, I said \\"who would fill the shoes of Martin Barre's guitar?\\". Turns out it's Florian Ophale. Then who would take over Jeffrey Hammond's role on bass guitar? It is David Goodier (who has been in Jethro Tull since 2006). Who would play the keyboards that John Evan did brilliantly on the original? John O'Hara (also been a Tull member since 2006). Finally, who would drum in the seat of Barriemore Barlow?\\" That role is taken over by Scott Hammond.<br />Over the years, alot of bands have done sequel albums to either classic albums or albums in their catalog that were either superb (KISS Alive II, Led Zeppelin 2, Led Zeppelin 3, Led Zeppelin IV, Van Halen II, Peter Gabriel (Scratch (Peter Gabriel 2), Melt (Peter Gabriel 3) and Security (Peter Gabriel 4)) or downright terrible (Queensryche's Operation : Mindcrime II, Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell III, Metallica's Re-Load and Alice Cooper's Welcome To My Nightmare 2). Luckily, Ian falls into the former with TaaB 2 as this is his best work he has done as a solo artist and has done since the 1989 Jethro Tull album Rock Island.<br />In this day and age of the single download and soundbite music garbage thrown by the musical floosies (Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Beyonce, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Katy Perry) and crap rap (LMFAO, Eminem, Kanye West, Jay Z and the ilk) of the world, a concept album is seen as old fashioned and also not acceptable in this current music climate (but someone forgot to tell that to Judas Priest who did Nostradamus in 2008 and also Ian Anderson). What does Ian Anderson do? He decides to come up with a What-If's, Maybes and Might Have Beens concept in the lyrics to see what happened to the hero from the original Thick As a Brick, the eight year old child prodigy Gerald Bostock (now aged 48).<br />The intro of the album reprises the riff that linked the two halves to Thick As Brick which then goes into a great rocker out of \\"From a Pebble Thrown\\". \\"Pebbles Instrumental\\" is a great piece. We follow with \\"Might-have-beens\\" which speaks of situations Gerald may be in today. The two pieces which sees Gerald as a banker \\"Upper Sixth Lower Shark\\" and \\"Banker Bets, Banker Wins\\" are excellent and fits in the story. The story that sees Gerald as Homeless is represented in the rockers \\"Swing It Far\\" and \\"Adrift and Confounded\\" which are superb. Gerald as Military Man begins with \\"Old School Song\\" which reminds of the \\"I come down from the upper clouds\\" part from the original TaaB. Then it goes to \\"Wootton Basset Town\\" which is a superb piece of music.<br />Gerald as Choirster section is comprised of the brilliant \\"Power and Spirit\\" and \\"Give Till It Hurts\\" which sees if Gerald had become a Jimmy Swaggart type. Gerald as A Most Ordinary Man is summed up by the excellent \\"Cosy Corner\\" and \\"Shunt and Shuffle\\" which musically reminds me of \\"Locomotive Breath\\". Next is the epic \\"A Change of Horses\\" which is a great piece. The 22 Mulberry Walk is summed up in \\"Confessional\\" and the brilliant \\"Kismet in Suburbia\\". We close the album with \\"What-ifs, Maybes, Might-Have-Beens\\" which musically serves as a superb recap to an excellent album and with the outro from the original to bring the album full circle.<br />Thick As a Brick 2 is already in my running of Best Rock Album of 2012 and joins the likes of David Gilmour's On an Island, Rush's Snakes and Arrows, Dennis DeYoung's One Hundred Years From Now, Iron Maiden's The Final Frontier on the listof Superb New Albums by Veteran Rockers. It may not get the sales nor accolades but in my heart it is a brilliant album.<br />RECOMMENDED!of Superb New Albums by Veteran Rockers.

B002ZG999U|4.0|Hell has a lot of bonafied heroes running loose in the over-the-top, 'hell bent for leather' action film \\"The Expendables\\"; starring Statham, Li, Lundgren, Couture, Stallone, Austin, Crews, Rourke, Roberts, Schwarzenegger, and Willis; co-written/directed by Stallone; co-written by David Callaham. If Dante had thought of better ways to stir up a hornet's nest in the Inferno - he might have sought an exit plan that involved recruiting this team of mercenaries, martial artists, and hardcore tough guys - who enjoy going into a small foreign country, tearing the place up, and rescuing a single woman (Sandra, played by Gisele Itié). All to prove it can be done, and because the despot-tyrant (General Garza, played by David Zayas) who is in charge of the sadistic army in that little country - needs to be dethroned and the people under his severe rulership - rescued from his cruelty.

Rourke elevates the film by telling a tragic story and how it deeply affected him as a man of war.<br /><br />It is solid, straightforward, nihilistic and robust 'mercenary work' replete with high-end cinematography, low-end dialogue scripting, to-the-bone acting by several truly deadly warriors (in their own right), and non-stop 'hellion warfare' - once the odds are stacked against our heroes - and they opt to fulfill their own sense of noblesse oblige and go into that 'hell-hole' and set those good people free. Similar to the western classic \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" with Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen recruiting 'guns and killers' to ride down into a Mexican town and set free villagers who are plagued, humiliated, and routinely shot dead for disobeying a band of deadly outlaws.

1612680011|5.0|I was introduced to this book by a friend, who constantly spoke about the book in my presence; then, I decided to read the book for myself.  Once I started reading the book, I could not put the book down and stayed up until 4:00AM reading 3/4 of the book.  It taught me about wealth, how the wealth is generated, and the mindset of rich people.  As a college educated person, enjoying the middle class lifestyle, I realized that I was living worse than a poor person.  A poor person was broke with no debt, but, as a middle-class, I was broke and in-debt with a mortgage, auto & student loans.  Rich Dad book liberated me, financially.  I had a way out and it was not a job for next 40+ years.  I re-read it a day later and journal-ed as thoughts and actions came to mind.  Now, I know what it takes to be financially free and retire rich...
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I've read a lot of reviews for this book/series. And I've come to the conclusion that most folks are either going to *love* the 50 Shades series, or they're going to loathe it. Having read my fair share of fanfiction, while also getting my degree in English lit, I've seen both sides of the writing coin and have to say that this book has the makings of a *great* novel, with a great romantic pair akin to Romeo and his Juliet, and Catherine to her Heathcliff... the *makings*. This was a hastily released book/series. It was as if the author had the first draft leaked and just left it like that. Marks of greatness are there in the fatal flaws of Christian, the supreme innocence of Ana, hints at delicious complexities and satisfying resolution. However, more than just Christian has fatal flaws, sadly.<br /><br />The amount of repetition is almost embarrassing. And I'm not just talking about the sheer overload of sexual encounters described in this book, of which there are far too many (can there be too many you ask? YES!), but also of the turns of phrase that are beaten into the text until they're nothing but a bloody pulp. \\"Fair point well made\\", and \\"don't bite your lip\\" come to mind. Trimming these items down so that they aren't showing up every two or three pages, but often enough to create a rapport between the two main characters, would make this book a 4 or 5 star piece, easily.<br /><br />And can I simply point out that no woman \\"comes\\" as easily nor as often as Anastasia? I think the ease at which she orgasms could be considered a medical *disorder* that should be checked out by a doctor. Make sure that poor girl doesn't have some sort of very pleasurable cancer or something. It's embarrassing.<br /><br />Like I said though, these are hiccups that could have been smoothed out with further revision. Sadly, that was not done, and we have what we have. It's rough, but for those of us with an imagination, we can see where the book could go, and create satisfying corrections for ourselves to fill in the blanks. And for those without any imagination, well, just enjoy the sex scenes: there's a lot of them.

B0078WAB3E|4.0|Hell has a lot of bonafied heroes running loose in the over-the-top, 'hell bent for leather' action film \\"The Expendables\\"; starring Statham, Li, Lundgren, Couture, Stallone, Austin, Crews, Rourke, Roberts, Schwarzenegger, and Willis; co-written/directed by Stallone; co-written by David Callaham. If Dante had thought of better ways to stir up a hornet's nest in the Inferno - he might have sought an exit plan that involved recruiting this team of mercenaries, martial artists, and hardcore tough guys - who enjoy going into a small foreign country, tearing the place up, and rescuing a single woman (Sandra, played by Gisele Itié). All to prove it can be done, and because the despot-tyrant (General Garza, played by David Zayas) who is in charge of the sadistic army in that little country - needs to be dethroned and the people under his severe rulership - rescued from his cruelty. The themes of 'freedom & tyranny' run clean and straight. Rourke elevates the film by telling a tragic story and how it deeply affected him as a man of war.<br /><br />It is solid, straightforward, nihilistic and robust 'mercenary work' replete with high-end cinematography, low-end dialogue scripting, to-the-bone acting by several truly deadly warriors (in their own right), and non-stop 'hellion warfare' - once the odds are stacked against our heroes - and they opt to fulfill their own sense of noblesse oblige and go into that 'hell-hole' and set those good people free. Similar to the western classic \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" with Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen recruiting 'guns and killers' to ride down into a Mexican town and set free villagers who are plagued, humiliated, and routinely shot dead for disobeying a band of deadly outlaws. This film rinses clean in the end. It is a satisfying, old fashioned, profane retelling of the John Sturges' classic, which in turn was based on Akira Kurosawa's \\"The Seven Sumarai\\" with famous action star, Toshiro Mifune.<br /><br />All unities adhered to. Empathy runs strong on the `macho' dial-up. This is a `beer & deer sausage' movie if ever there was one.

B007DIQB50|5.0|I have been a big fan of Nicki Minaj since her appearances on various hip-hop and R&B hits during 2010. Her delivery and cheeky lyrics are just so irresistible.  In almost every song she is `featured' in, her verse is the best part of the song (think \\"Monster\\" and \\"Bottoms Up\\").  \\"Pink Friday\\" was on heavy rotation on my iPod during late 2010 and 2011, \\"Moment 4 Life\\", \\"Fly\\", \\"Roman's Revenge\\", and \\"Blazin'\\" in particular.<br /><br />After \\"Roman In Moscow\\" and \\"Stupid H*e\\" were released as `previews' of Nicki's second album, I was worried that I wouldn't like it. I didn't care for these songs.  I did like the next previews \\"Roman's Holiday\\" and \\"Starships\\" though, so there was hope \\"Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded\\" would be a good album.  Come April 3rd, and after listening to the album in its entirety (all 22 songs!), I think \\"Roman Reloaded\\" is an awesome album!<br /><br />\\"Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded\\" actually exceeded my expectations. I like almost every song on it.  It is a very diverse album - there are hardcore hip-hop, electro-pop, and R&B songs on here. The album starts with hardcore hip-hop, then into mid-tempo R&B, then jumps to electro-pop, then to some pop-R&B ballads.  I appreciate any performer that can do a variety of music and pull it off well. And it's amazing how Nicki's personality is fierce and rough in the first half, then sugar sweet in the second.  Like Taylor Swift does with pop and country fans, Nicki Minaj helps bridge the gap between pop and hip-hop fans.<br /><br />\\"Beez In The Trap\\" is my choice for the best hip-hop song.  The beats literally pierce your eardrums if you are listening to it on earphones.  Besides \\"Starships\\", the best electro-pop song is \\"Pound The Alarm\\"- super danceable and catchy, as well. \\"Va Va Voom\\", \\"Champion\\" (with Nas & Drake), \\"Roman's Holiday\\", \\"HOV Lane\\", \\"Whip It\\", & \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" are also among the better songs on the album. \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" is one of three songs that display Nicki's vulnerable side. \\"Champion\\" is this album's \\"Moment 4 Life\\".<br /><br />Now for the negative - yes, I agree that Nicki is not a prolific rapper. And her music isn't particularly creative. But it doesn't matter, because Nicki's music is meant to be infectious (and she succeeds with that!).<br /><br />Both hip-hop and pop fans should check out this album. If you're a fan of both genres (like me), you'll really this album because you get two in one.ion\\" is this album's \\"Moment 4 Life\\".<br /><br />Now for the negative - yes, I agree that Nicki is not a prolific rapper.

B004H7Q2ZO|4.0|In Italian<br /><br />L'inferno ha molti eroi di bonafied che corre sciolto nel sopra-il-la cima, 'l'inferno ha piegato per la pelle' il film di azione \\"I Materiali di consumo\\"; avendo il ruolo principale Statham, Li, Lundgren, l'Alta moda, Stallone, Austin, gli Equipaggi, Rourke, Roberts, Schwarzenegger e Willis; scritto da C.ia/diretto da Stallone; C.ia-scritto da David Callaham. Se Dante aveva pensato di maniere migliori per fomentare un nido del calabrone nell'Inferno - potrebbe aver cercato un progetto di uscita che ha coinvolto reclutando questa squadra di mercenari, gli artisti marziali e gli individui hardcore duri - che piace andare in un piccolo paese straniero, facendo a pezzi il luogo, e soccorrere una donna sola (Sandra, giocato da Gisele Itié). Tutto provarlo può essere fatto e perché il despota-tiranno (Garza Generale, giocato da David Zayas) che è responsabile dell'esercito sadico in quel piccolo paese - deve essere detronizzato e le persone sotto il suo rulership severo - soccorso dalla sua crudeltà. I temi di 'la libertà & la tirannia' è corso pulito e diritto. Rourke eleva il film dicendo una storia tragica e come l'ha colpito profondamente come un uomo di guerra.<br /><br />È il \\"lavoro solido, semplice, nichilista e robusto venale\\" sazio con la cinematografia di alto-fine, lo scripting di dialogo di basso-fine, a-il-l'osso che agisce da diversi guerrieri davvero mortali (nella loro propria destra), e la \\"guerra di hellion\\" senza interruzione - una volta la probabilità è accatastata contro i nostri eroi - ed optano per soddisfare il loro proprio senso di noblesse obbliga e va in che l'inferno-foro e ha regolato quelle buone persone libera. Simile al classico occidentale \\"Il Magnifico Sette\\" con Yul Brynner e Steve McQueen che recluta 'le pistole e gli assassini' di passeggiare giù in una città messicana e ha liberato degli abitanti del villaggi che sono tormentati, i morti di colpo umiliati, e routine per disubbidire una banda di fuorilegge mortali. Queste risciacquate di film puliscono nella fine. È un soddisfare, il vecchio profano foggiato, che ridice del John Sturges' il classico, che nel giro è stato basato su Kurosawa di Akira \\"Il Sette Sumarai\\" con la famosa stella di azione, Toshiro Mifune.<br /><br />Tutte le unità hanno aderito a. L'empatia corre forte sul `macho' con connessione remota. Questo è un `beer & la salsiccia di cervo' il film se mai c'era uno.
0525423656|4.0|So I read Matched and it kind of dragged on but I went through it. I have read Crossed and I must say I am on Ky's team all the way. I know Xander has the hotness factor but his actions seam a bit suspect to me. Ky is such a sweetheart and I hope she makes the right decision. Indie is a bit sneaky but maybe she will end up with who she likes. Even though at the end of this book it makes me think the Society planned the whole thing. That might just be my Hunger games mind at work though.
0439023513|2.0|After part one and two of this trilogy, I was a bit disappointed at the deterioration of Katniss's character. She quickly went from a brave girl put in a bad situation trying to take care of her poor and struggling family, to an in my opinion, selfish, irritating, and ungrateful person. As the story went on, I became more and more indifferent about Katniss's survival because she seemed so completely shallow and ungrateful regarding all of the people who risked their lives to save her.  In actuality, Katniss was nothing more than an attractive girl (when cleaned up) who could shoot an arrow.  She did not have the intellectual or emotional depth that her peers had.  Prim seemed to have more care and wisdom than Katniss. After the second book, I was fed up with Katniss and her indecisiveness and her obsession with \\"owing people\\" who simply did things to help her.  Instead of being touched or grateful,  she had the attitude of \\"Oh great, now another person I have to pay back in some way\\", I found this aspect of her character disgusting.  Her entire journey seemed to depend on luck and other people.  If she truly had to go through the experience of the Hunger Games alone like most of her peers, she would have died immediately.<br /><br />The only interesting part of Mockingjay was how Peeta was brainwashed to kill Katniss. I thought it was rather interesting how it seemed less of a brainwashing and more of a personality reveal.  It was as if the Capital removed his \\"love blinders\\" and saw how much of a user Katniss was. Peeta had it right, she was someone who did not deserve to be in the position she was in.  I also did not understand why Peeta was so in love with Katniss.  There was nothing about her, other than looks and hunting skills for him to actually love. She actually seemed unlovable. She had moments of kindness but they were just moments. The constant Gale/Peeta love triangle was exhausting and with all the build up of who she would end up with, the conclusion seemed completely an afterthought. Gale disappears from the story and she ends up with Peeta seemingly by default.  Gale and Katniss had such a history together and Gale and in the end he just is sent off to another district, that's it? It makes me feel like she never really loved him either and just enjoyed two men fighting over her. Hopefully, Gale ends up with someone deserving of his love. Katniss may have partially blamed him for Prim's death (which the reader can assume he would have never knowingly took part of) and that is why she can't be with him but even that idea was never thoroughly explored. She knows in her heart he would never do that but she easily writes him off too.<br /><br />Another important character that fell to the waist side is Cinna.  I was confused as to when he actually died, when he was beaten in front of Katniss at the Quarter Quell or later because he made that Mockinjay suit for her.  I am sure if he were a prisoner, he would not have access to sewing supplies.  Or did he have some premonition that she would need that special suit of armor to fight in the war and made it before the second games? Haymitch's character also seems to disappointingly fall off and just end up where he started, a drunk. Very sad and useless. The end of President Snow and Katniss assassinating the new president was also unsatisfying and not explained much at all.<br />Even though Katniss somewhat becomes human and less self absorbed enough to actually create a book commemorating those lost in the Hunger Games over the years and get married and have children as described in the epilogue, it all seems too little too late.  So many wasted lives and opportunities.  It is great that PANEM is free of the barbaric games....for now but the ending just fell flat. It is as if the author just was tired of the story herself and wanted to finish it as fast as possible.  If Suzanne Collins had been as committed to the final book as the first, she would have been able to wrap up the story acknowledging the important characters in full and maybe putting Katniss through the character change that she so desperately needed.  I realize that she was a teenager but her peers of the same age were so much more mature, selfless, and emotionally developed than her. Katniss's shtick of bailing when things got too real was just tiring.  When confronted with making a choice in the area of love, she withdraws, when the pain was too much she indulged in morphling, when the war got too tough she wanted to kill herself, when she had to follow the rules in 13 she ignores it, when returned back to district 12 she became a shut in! Need I say more!?! Katniss in reality was a selfish and emotionally stunted girl who just got lucky.  Even though large parts of this story frustrated me, I found it interesting and enjoyable.  Unfortunately, I do not feel it is something I will remember years later due to the disappointing protagonist and the lazy conclusion to her and other characters in the story's journey.rap up the story acknowledging the important characters in full and maybe putting Katniss through the character change that she so desperately needed.

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I fell asleep during the movie. It is pretty bad the parts I watched.  Wasnt funny and was bored the whole time.
0312576463|1.0|I struggled to finish this book.  I was so disappointed. After hearing so much about Jonathan Franzen for a year, I finally relented.  After about 100 pages, the only word that came to mind was \\"trite.\\"  There is nothing new or original or groundbreaking here.  The style has about the sophistication of my aunt's Christmas letter updates.  The Oprah's Book Club sticker gave me some hope, but I now realize that the target audience is bored housewives whose scale for determining the \\"greatness\\" of a novel is how easy it is to read.<br />I think a particularly poignant scene demonstrating the overall lameness of Franzen's attempts to be \\"hip\\" is the Bright Eyes concert.  I doubt a middle aged environmental lawyer would enjoy such a concert.  And by the time this concert took place, Bright Eyes was already mainstream and overall passe.  I think this is as much an effort by Franzen to connect with (or pander to) twenty-somethings as for the characters and the result is equally lame.<br />If this is a realist portrait of American life, then we are in much worse trouble than we thought.  Thankfully it isn't and I wonder if the author escapes too far outside the New York Review of Books to realize it.

B007J7LFTW|4.0|The original Thick as a Brick is easily among my favorite albums, if not at the very top. This album is no where near that level, but it does have flashes of brilliance. Ian has stated several times that, like the original, TAAB2 is quite seamless despite the iTunes friendly \\"ID points.\\" However, I tend to disagree. Many ID points have definite closure, and differ completely from the following track. This was a little disappointing, but it's not the end of the world. I'm sure it doesn't bother most people.<br /><br />Throughout the album, I would have liked to hear a bit more Hammond organ, but when it is incorporated, namely in Old School Song, it sounds fantastic. Lot's of great flute. Obviously. Well-balanced, though, not too much, not too little. As to be expected, Ian's acoustic playing is as good as ever, and actually make up some of favorite parts of the album. The gritty riff at the beginning of Adrift and Dumbfounded is excellent, and the beginning of Give 'til it Hurts fits right in with much of Ian's acoustic work in the 70s. Florian Opahle does a good job as well. He's not Martin Barre, so don't expect him to be. If you can't forgive Ian for recording a Thick as a Brick follow up without Martin then I'm not sure why you're reading this review anyway. You'd be far happier reading a one-star review calling for the retirement of that twisted, selfish, rotten scoundrel Ian Anderson. But, I digress.<br /><br />Overall, I was pleased with Ian's vocals. Obviously, his voice has seen better days, but I was dreading a performance akin to what I had heard from a few recent concerts on posted Youtube. Yes, it's pretty nasally, but it's certainly not painful to listen to. However, I really dislike the Aqualung-like effect that he uses on tracks like Old School Song and Banker Bets, Banker Wins. Instead of covering it up, I think it amplifies that nasally sound, and for the most part I just wish he wouldn't have used it.<br /><br />Lyrically, it has its forced, strained moments (Adrift and Dumbfounded), but it's pretty solid for the most part. Wootton Bassett Town is great, and I really like the recap of sorts in Kismet in Suburbia where he succinctly summarizes Gerald's multiple life scenarios.<br /><br />It's not an instant classic, but there are still some great songs, er \\"ID points.\\" If you're a big Jethro Tull fan, it's definitely worth the money.
B006GKHE6G|3.0|The Tegra graphics are nice with good water effects, but the game feels dull overall.  Perhaps it's more due to courses that were likely designed to use tilt controls (and ironically the game is MUCH more fun with a pad), or maybe the courses themselves are just not that great, but I never really got much sense of immersion.  Different jetskis don't seem to handle any differently and you're always either ahead by a mile or can't catch up to save your life.  To be fair, I base any water racer off of Wave Race standards...  but if anything, this game reminded me of Hydro Thunder a little and the graphics are nice to show off your T2 device.  The problem is that it just isn't all that fun (especially for the price).

B00701QVVY|5.0|So often glowing reviews are put out there by long time fans of a band who feel that their heroes can do no wrong.  Metallica could fart and belch into a microphone and there would be people lining up to praise it simply because it carried the Metallica name.  This is not one such review.  I'm not a long time, die hard fan of Overkill.  I've heard all of their catalog and I own about half of it. It takes a lot for me to put a review of something up here, so these words are probably as objective as you can get.  And now...<br /><br />Consistency, thy name might as well be Overkill. In a career spanning more than 25 (!!!) years and a staggering 17 albums, the east coast thrashers have never enjoyed the same amount of mainstream success as many of their peers (Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer, etc.), but then again, they've never sold out either.  When one considers that even the mighty Slayer farted out duds like Diabolus in Musica and God Hates Us All, this kind of track record is all the more amazing.  Even on an album like I Hear Black (which some fans--not me-- regard as sub-par for flirting with doomy tempos and some groove metal elements) is still a far cry from the MTV-friendly cack that Metallica and Megadeth were putting out at that time.  In fact, I Hear Black, like Testament's The Ritual has actually aged fairly well.  But I digress.<br /><br />Like Overkill's previous album Ironbound, The Electric Age offers no surprises, musically speaking.  This is pure, heads-down, fist-in-the-air thrash metal. There are no prog flights of fancy, no extended acoustic numbers, and Blitz doesn't try his hand at rapping.  And thank the metal gods for that. The only surprise is that after endless lineup changes and label shuffles, Overkill is just as good as they were way back in the Years of Decay era.  In fact, I think they're even better. Link and Tailer are arguably the best guitarists Overkill has had, and Lipnicki is without a doubt the best drummer. The production here is also top notch, taming some of the metallic clang in D.D. Verni's bass so that it sits more comfortably in the mix.<br /><br />There are no bad tracks on The Electric Age.  Literally every single one of them is a winner, but there are a few standouts.  Electric Rattlesnake, with its mid-song detour into Sabbath territory, is a smorgasbord of tasty riffs. All Over But the Shouting has an appropriately shout-along chorus. Come and Get It has a pounding intro that builds to a furious thrasher.  Bring the Hammer Down had a mid-paced swagger that is downright infectious. Actually, each and every song has at least one part that makes you want to crush a beer and stomp around like a madman.<br /><br />To sum up: this is seriously good thrash metal. As good as Worship Music is, this is the album that Anthrax only wishes they could make.  And it goes without saying that it's head and shoulders above the bloated turkey that is Megadeth's Thirteen. The only thing that keeps me from declaring this the thrash metal album of the year is the fact that both Kreator and Testament still have releases on the horizon. Go ahead and click the Buy Now button.  You can thank me later.
B006O99SYA|4.0|Peking (now named as \\"Beijing\\") is the political capital of China which has a long cultural and political history. The image of this metropolis during the 1930s was interwoven with chronic political struggles between communists and nationalists, the ascendancy and recession of foreign powers and warlords, and the presence of Japanese militarism. The historical reconstruction of a murder case of a 19-year old English woman in January of 1937 has unveiled how justice could be distorted and trampled by a group of people from the privileged class.<br /><br />In this book, what might make readers squirm is that the murder suspects, diplomats, and members of the justice community were well-educated people and/or enjoyed excellent social reputation. They, however, were habitu&eacute;s of whorehouses and dive-bars who deliberately preyed on young women for maniacal sexual appetite. The headmaster of Tientsin Grammar School, Sydney Yeates and an Oxford graduate, was reputedly a dapper but he had approached the murderee, Pamela Werner, in a manner \\"unbecoming of a headmaster with pupil\\" (P.141) while she was at school. Wentworth Pinsent, a reputable dentist and a \\"long-standing member\\" (P.156) of Peking's foreign community, was suspected of allying with John O'Brian (a suitor of Pamela) George Gorman (an editor of the Peking Chronicle), Pinfold (a European from Badlands), and Joe Knauf (an American cabaret manager) to kill Pamela in the Badlands (domain of prostitutes and dope addicts) and dump her mutilated body at the Fox Tower. Despite widespread media coverage and the magnitude of this murder case, the Peking police and British authorities deliberately covered up the evidence and put the inquest to a halt. The murder case passed unnoticed with the advent of Japanese invasion of Beijing by mid-1937.<br /><br />Pamela Werner and his father (Edward Werner), a retired British consul and sinologist, have been depicted by the author as victims of the horrific moment in China. Born and raised in Peking, Pamela looked like a plain student from a grammar school but she was coaxed by people from the privileged class who were violent and tried to rape her. His father got despondent while two key detectives, one from the Peking police (Han) and another from Tientsin British Concession (DCI Dennis) failed to identify the suspects. Thereafter he carried on private investigation into the murder and appealed repeatedly to the British authorities in China and London. Unfortunately the case of the murder of his daughter was never opened again.<br /><br />This is a very impressive novel with historical facts on a mysterious murder in China during the 1930s. The author claims to readers that this novel can serve to award a \\"belated justice\\" (P.272) to Pamela and her father who have been forgotten in history. Readers can get access to [...] that includes an audio walking tour of the major sites, a map of old Peking, photographs, and original news clippings of the investigation. This book is highly recommended to readers who are interested in Holmes-or Eco-style detective novel and history of China during the 1930s.ng, Pamela looked like a plain student from a grammar school but she was coaxed by people from the privileged class who were violent and tried to rape her.

B000FS9FCG|5.0|An excellent and realistic film depicting many relevancies to our own lifestyle and the world we choose to believe in.
B003O86FMW|5.0|For the genre, it was very well written and really believable. Drawing from the past (Ancient Rome) and from the present ideas of what the future could hold (high speed trains, nuclear war, etc...) the entire premise is very well done. I enjoyed it immensely.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is the best angry birds ever. I downloaded it thinking I'd kill ten minutes on a few levels... that was two hours ago!
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|app loads fine on my kindle fire.  I just didnt find it very useful.  I don't think you can update anything in your profile (like job experience) .  Imo that is missing a huge piece of functionality.  another good example of a business just needed &quot;an app &quot; and missed the boat on making a USEFUL app
B0055SWM08|5.0|hi i like this game even though i do not have it and it looks fun but i dont have $0.99 so yeah......... :(
B003O86FMW|3.0|It's great so far. The first one(The Hunger Games)was great. But my sister hates Gale when she read the third book(Mokingjay).
B0054JZC6E|3.0|All games i 've tried have delay in movement. the items move much slower than your finger, making it more difficult to play. nonetheless, the idea of so many games, is excellent
B001HN69AY|1.0|So this is how the world will remember Heath Ledger? Gee I hope not or else 'ol Heath will be spinning in his grave. The premise (I think) is some guy has a curtain where people go through it and come out a better happier person. I wish I could say the same about myself after watching this colorful turd.<br /><br />The problem is with Terry Gilliam's trademark style of bland forgettable characters and a boring/predictable story which makes for an excurciating watch which feels like a long bad acid trip. Terry tries to overcompensate for his lack of substance by using dazzling visuals, which just come off as a distraction from the weak and sloppy storyline. From what I remember from the story, the main character (who was played by like 4 different actors, in case you're not confused enough) gets volunteers to go into a curtain into his rape dungeon or whatever and they all proclaim it's the best thing since sliced bread, and yet everyone is still skeptical. All of the scenes were either in the fantasy land that shows you a whole lot of nothing or the circus preformers hanging out in the mud outside. That's about all I could remember before I turned it off. I do have to admit though the Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus does make for a good coaster for my coffee mug.<br /><br />If you're a glutten for punishment than this tedious clusterf*** has your name all over it.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|this is a great app. I can make sure I don't miss any bills weekly monthly or in the future.
0857520652|5.0|Harold Fry, retired brewery employee and married to Maureen, receives a letter out of the blue from a former colleague, Queenie Hennessy. She is in a hospice in Berwick on Tweed and doesn't have long to live. Harold writes her a letter and sets out to post it but for some reason he doesn't quite understand he keeps walking. After talking to a girl in a petrol station he decides to walk to Berwick on Tweed even though he lives in Devon and he is determined Queenie must live to see him for the last time.<br /><br />What follows is the story not just of Harold's journey and the people he meets along the way but of his life, the mistakes he feels he has made and the people who have mattered most to him. But things don't stand still while he is away from home and Maureen starts to examine her own life and considers how she has contributed to her own unhappiness.<br /><br />The book is well written and thought provoking novel and it reduced me to tears on several occasions. But it is not a sad story overall and there are many amusing incidents and some marvellous minor characters who will stay with you long after you have finished reading.<br /><br />I liked Harold himself because he is not afraid of examining his life and his character. He is not perfect and he knows there are things he could and should have done differently. As well as being a pilgrimage his walk is an attempt at atonement for his past sins and when others start to join him he finds they too have a story to tell of mistakes made and actions regretted.<br /><br />Journeys are a favourite topic for novelists as is escape from claustrophobic life situations. Geographical distance can lend objectivity but it also reminds people that they cannot escape from what goes on in their own heads and what is contained in their own memories. If you enjoyed these The Spring Madness of Mr. Sermon Major Pettigrew's Last Stand Mr. Rosenblum's List: Or Friendly Guidance for the Aspiring Englishman then you may enjoy this oneone
B007J7LFTW|5.0|better than i expected. It seems more like an after thought at times, which might be appropriate for what the album intended.
B0010X745K|4.0|I think it depends on how people see human nature. Personally I loved this horror movie 20 minutes on because the truly frightening aspect of it wasn't so much the mostly shrouded monsters, but more so how people act in dire circumstances. If I were in that situation with my neighbors and townsfolk and they all as Tom Jane said \\"have all their electricity turned off and the s*** scared out of them, they're willing to believe anything\\". It's a very bleak and unflinching look at humanity, but look at Nazi Germany, look at the Donnor Party, look at the Salem Witch Trials for a few examples if you think that people would act like a rational team in horrible circumstances. Just thank the stars most of us haven't had to be in that situation.<br /><br />The monsters themselves were unique and original, and they kind of reminded me of Silent Hill 1, with very insect/dinosaur shapes. They did look a little cheesy which I think was Darabount's way to tribute to the 50's monster movies. Still their corny look was played completely sober and all of the deaths looked very gruesome and painful.<br /><br />Maybe the reason I liked the Mist so much was because of how dark and bleak the whole experience was, a man dies in vain trying to save his DoA burned brother, a local town brutally murders a local soldier, and of course there's the pitch-black ending. There were no hollywood touches on this, no silly comic relief, the cute widdle kid was pretty much comatose with fear the whole time (which is a way more realistic portrayl of kids in horror movies than I usually see). It's very refreshing to see a horror movie pull no punches.
B0052U59F4|5.0|wow, holy smokes ,definitely riviting, burns up the screen,certainly recommended better than 79 park ave the it book of my generation
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a quality game but there is better ones I like the variety of different games to choose from and they don't cost money so that's great
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|This is a solid Andrew Lloyd Weber musical. As I'm sure you know, it's the sequel to the legendary \\"Phantom of the Opera\\".<br /><br />The picture quality on this Blu-ray is outstanding. This was a very lavish production and they took care to capture it all as nicely as possible. There's dramatic camera tracks etc., even though it's a film of a stage production.<br /><br />The music is excellent, as we've come to expect from the composer. The storyline is a bit of a let down, being essentially a re-hash of its predecessor.<br /><br />If you like Andrew Lloyd Weber, you really can't go wrong with this. It's better than most of the crap out there.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|I was very pleased with this purchase. It was delivered quickly and was what I expected. I would highly reccomend this to any Whitney fan!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. I play it all day and night on my kindle fire and android phone. :) The movement of the cards is great also. So much better than playing on my home computer.
B0073XORCY|5.0|No this isn't Jethro Tull in their prime, but don't diss it because of that.  Take it for what it's worth, an offering from a veteran rocker, who still has his chops down.  Outstanding concept album, with the typical Ian Anderson cynicism.  If you listen to this with realistic expectations (given that Ian's voice ain't what it used to be), you will be impressed.  I know I am!
B007DIQB50|2.0|Nicki Minaj has become one of those artist that records albums just for the money. \\"Roman Reloaded\\" has no real meaning, no lyrical depth, and does not display the skills that her original (underground) fans fell in love with. There are about 3-4 songs that are just okay, and that's mainly because they are being carried by a feature (like the record with Cam'Ron, and the record with Drake). \\"Pink Friday\\" was much better as it was just enough growth from the streets to mainstream. Now she's turned into a clown, and has made a joke out of rap.<br /><br />In conclusion, the entire album is dumb, senseless, and a sell-out to Hip Hop. People will buy it, sadly that's all that was cared about when it was recorded. When Hip-Hop artist go the crossover route it's done to be able to capture more than one audience, people who have done it successfully while containing their reputation are Kanye West, Jay-Z, and even Lil' Wayne. I don't know why people who are in Nicki's camp didn't give her advice on how to do it without looking and sounding like a fool.
B006O3MU96|4.0|just as good as Doodle jump. maybe better. but does not jump as high as the doodler on Doodle jump.
0385342063|5.0|I loved, loved, LOVED, this book!  It kept me guessing, thinking, and smiling throughout.<br /><br />This book starts out with shades of Becky Bloomwood (beloved heroine of another Kinsella series, the fantastic \\"Shopaholic\\" series) where you instantly love the girl but can see how she's about to do something that's going to cause problems.  Kind of an \\"I Love Lucy\\" feel.  And while this is the case for maybe the first quarter (if that) of the book, things slowly slip into a more realistic more mature and sensible series of events and we start to see that the characters were really just in impossible situations and are really quite sane otherwise :)<br /><br />Kinsella's writing is brilliant - funny, fast, witty, and clever.  Kinsella makes an, I think, brilliant choice here, where a good portion of the book relies on text exchanges.  I don't know how she managed to make the texts so vivid and carry the story so well, but she did.  Also, I must add, this books has the most fun and awesome use of footnotes I think I've ever seen!<br />(Only one cautionary note: While this book is blissfully free of any raunchy bedroom scenes, etc., the \\"F-word\\" is used more than once.  It's nothing that bothered me, but I know it would bother some people who would probably otherwise love the story.)<br /><br />I felt like I knew exactly what the characters were thinking and feeling, and I loved the characters so much that I would have been happy to just read about their daily lives.<br /><br />Poppy makes for a delightful heroine and I was really routing for her.  Refreshingly, Poppy is NICE.  She's got a few flaws, sure, but she's always a nice person.  She's always reassessing her own actions and she's willing and glad to help others.  This doesn't make her a pushover or a ditz, but just a good, kind person who you are hoping finds someone equally as good to go through life with.<br /><br />Which brings me to the fact that YAY I finally love a Kinsella leading man!!!  While I've never really had issues with, say Luke Brandon (again, Shopaholic) I never got those \\"warm fuzzies\\" for him.  But the leading man in \\"I've Got Your Number\\" is just so wonderful that it only took a few chapters for me to fall in love with him myself.  And what's more, not only has Kinsella written a book with two fantastic characters, she did an excellent job of illustrating how those characters are excellent *for each other*.<br /><br />This is definitely a book I'd recommend, and one that I would love to read again myself!
B003ZMF26W|1.0|The software is horrible and not user friendly. Resets any saved settings when you open the program.<br /><br />The mouse itself is weighted and not customizable (you can't make it lighter)<br /><br />If you pick up the mouse even 1mm it jumps like crazy and makes FPS games unplayable.<br /><br />It has nice DPI however if you need to move mouse right and left really fast it is bad because it is so large.<br /><br />I would only use this mouse for regular desktop usage or possibly slow paced MMO.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the book series!  Was great to get the short review before I downloaded the whole trilogy.  Download process was super easy and it was great having the book on my iPhone to read whenever I had a minute.  Will definitely download others.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|This is a fun game if you are into zombies for kids and adults.  It is very simple to learn and play - and entertaining.  Also, very portable.  The only complaint is that the bottom of the tube isn't very sturdy and falls out when you are shaking the dice.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|great movie perfect for a woman who likes a clean and pure romance, try to imagine if you were born in that time, a woman's virtue was precious thing.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Great series, really addicting. Can't wait for the next season. Played without any problems. Watched first 3 seasons on Amazon Prime for free.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its fine to pass the time but it takes awhile to earn points to buy new games and the games are some what hard.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Best book I've ever read.  Way better than twilight!..believe all the great things you hear about these books.  If you watched the hunger games movie, you just MUST read the book to fully appreciate it.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I like the game. Didn't like the unoriginal first game, but this one was creative. Also happy to see the fire owners can still spam. A lot.
0345529057|5.0|I have really enjoyed the books. I am in college and love a good read outside of my class reading. Some say I read to much but these books make you want to read. Five stars simply for a great price they were at my door step in no time flat and I like I said I have simply enjoyed the books.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|i thought this was a great book; not too long but enjoyable; it was written as if the dog was speaking to his owner and how the dog felt re sickness and death and how the dog saw aging in himself. animal lovers, especially dog lovers will enjoy this book;
B00756GKBA|5.0|Since bursting into the music scene 30 years ago in 1982, Madonna still tops them all and remains the undisputed Queen of Pop! Her latest and 12th studio album, MDNA, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart this week. It's her 5th consecutive No. 1 album and her 8th overall! Ooh lala you're my superstar!<br /><br />After repeated listenings to this fantastic album, I can say that this is undoubtedly her BEST. There are no bum tracks and every song is worth listening to. All cuts have their own distinct quality and I can say that listening to MDNA is an addicting experience because it's one fantastic song after the other.<br /><br />I hope that the next singles will be : Superstar, Love Spent, Turn Up the Radio, I Don't Give A, I'm A Sinner, Beautiful Killer, I F**cked Up, Gang Bang... but I also like B-Day which is so cute and Falling Free and Best Friend are introspective wonderful songs. Every track is a winner and I am really happy that this album is No. 1.<br /><br />Hail to the Queen of Pop, Madonna. Thank you for giving us the joy of your music and the privilege of appreciating your artistry in our lifetime. Long live the Queen!!! Can't wait for your forthcoming world tour!
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|This is the Doritos of literature. Doritos are a pretty tasty snack, but they're not very nutritious and you kind of get sick of them after eating a whole bag by yourself.<br />This book was entertaining and fun, but a complete Mary Sue. I guess it's like Twilight for nerds. Okay, not quite that bad. Still, the goal here seems to be for nerd boys to plug their brains into this character and live out a badass life, which is pretty meta considering it's a book about people plugging into a virtual reality to live out their badass fantasies via their avatars. And sometimes their avatars play games. So you'll be a nerd, dreaming of being a nerd who dreams of being a nerd. Christopher Nolan, I believe we have a sequel to Inception over here. Jump on that.<br />The book starts out pretty slowly, with huge paragraphs that essentially name drop every nerdy, cult-followed thing from the 80's that the author could think of. It gets tedious. The book does pick up around halfway in, but sheesh, that's a lot of book to get through. Had I not been on a road trip I think I'd've quit before it got better. But then it DOES get better, albeit \\"better\\" meaning \\"entertaining but shallow wish fulfillment story.\\"<br />So if you're looking for a literary snack (and really, there's nothing wrong with that once in a while), it's fun, it makes you feel like a badass for a while, and it'll keep you off the streets causing a ruckus and giving noogies to old ladies or whatever it is the kids are doing these days.
