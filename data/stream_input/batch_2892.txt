B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved all the books in this series!!! They were a great read!!!!! Look forward to more from Sylvia day!!!!
0811875555|5.0|This is probably one of the best art books available. It has many illustrations (concepts and after) even how they crafted The story and scenes. I recommended this product for any Disney fanatic.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I enjoyed the complete series and have watched the series more than once.  All the stars were quite good, many I had not heard of before.
B00AFEY354|5.0|My teenage daughter's favorite movie.  She said it was like someone wrote a movie about her. I haven't seen it but it seems to really hit home for the younger generation.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I enjoyed the complete series and have watcher the whole series more than once. All the stars were quite good.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I am nine years old and I love this game . sometimes I get a good scare and sometimes I get stuck so I click the help button and It tells me what to do . don't worry about the price because the game is very long and interesting . I recommend you buy this game .
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins was able to break all characters down, through personality, their emotional and psychological status be it positive or negative. You did not just read about the games .....she had you right there physically and psychologically.
B005LJITS0|5.0|Rented this after it fell off our DVR and the movie was really good and the quality was great.  Didn't have any issues with using Amazon Video Services.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Grew up loving this game, yet very hard to play due to set up and time restraints. Frustrating !!! Irritating !!!!
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|Honestly, I was expecting much more from this flick. While Judge Dredd (the Original) was quite cheesy, I was expecting a bit more of the original plot theme. There was almost none in this new version. The whole story is just plain weak. The movies tries to make up for its weak story line with intensive, explicit violent special effect that are just disturbing. While this doesn't really bother me much, a young person or easily unsettled viewer will likely not even finish the movie. The writer should have made a much better effort and not just plagiarized the name of the first film.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Best books I could have ever asked for! I'm very very pleased with my purchase in every single was possible!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|The company doesn't care about the customers who play this game.  You try to finish a room but you just spend thousands of credits and STILL they won't give you what you need to complete a room.  Don't get started with this game.
0131480057|5.0|Cliche, it is nevertheless true that this is the only book the typical Linux/Unix user will need if they stay with one of the major<br />distributions.  Say one of the Ubuntu family,  openSUSE, and Redhat, for example.  A large book, it covers most of the everyday<br />issues a system administrator or serious user will encounter.  For those of us with less than photographic memories, it's a great<br />place to review topics.  It's sad that one of the lead authors is now gone, but up through year 2011 this is a comprehensive<br />reference, well laid out, and easy to follow.  Where it doesn't cover a topic that might, for example, be arcane, it provides many<br />references and tips for finding more detailed information.

B007PJFFWC|4.0|Well-produced with great performances. Most of all, it is entertaining. This film shows the importance of story telling and the importance of the desire in each of us to live bigger then we are. Filed with funny moments, heartfelt sequences, and fantastical sequences, Big Fish is a great film for date night, when you are home alone, or when you want to be dazzled and reminded of an overlooked aspect of life--the grandness of our existence in a world filled with amazing people and circumstances.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Here I am writing a review again. I do enjoy the game so I write a review to playa nother level
B008JFUPK8|2.0|*******Spoiler Alert**********<br /><br />*******Spoiler Alert**********<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of remakes, reboots, etc.  I thought the Dark Knight series was fantastic.  I went to see 'Superman Returns' because I like Bryan Singer and because superhero movies are like pizza...even when they're not good, they aren't that bad, knowing that is the type of movie you're going to see.<br /><br />When I heard Zack Snyder was directing, I thought oh crap.  I thought '300' was a flaming turd of a movie and haven't liked any of his other films either.  However, sometimes people surprise you and Chris Nolan did a great job on Batman, so I thought he might help Zack reel it in a little.  Teaser trailer looked good, so I was hopeful.  The later trailers showed more of it, so I began getting worried again it would be bad.<br /><br />Henry Cavill is good.  Definitely a little more sullen than the last two Supermans, but no big deal.  Krypton was a bit too stylized for me.<br /><br />The visual effects are incredible, but that gets boring after a few minutes.  Yep, big, amazing action scenes that drag on too dang long.<br /><br />I overall liked the movie up until the final battle.  Sure, some of the earlier action could have been toned down about 90%, but not a huge problem.  I like how once he puts on the suit and turns himself into the army he shows them he is cooperating with them, but he certainly doesn't have to and there isn't anything the army can do to control him.  Once the final battle starts, oh man.....big, and looooong.  I thought tossing each other through buildings and it not even effecting them was silly.  Yes, I realize there are human looking aliens that are flying around and I'm accepting that as not silly, but you have to have some way to hurt them or slow them down.  Invincible characters are boring because there is no risk.  Not to mention, they just killed thousands of people by knocking all of those buildings over.  So, after wishing for the end, itcame.  Okay, they've just been smashed through how many buildings and had super punches, etc and it didn't even phase them, but Superman can break Zod's neck.  Are you f'n serious.  First off, Superman doesn't kill people.  He is GOOD and he is smart, he would find another way.  Secondly, if a building won't slow you down, and you're basically invincible, how the eff can your neck be broken?  F'N retarded.  While Superman 2 was pretty cheesy, it made more sense how he could defeat them.  He had to take their powers away because the four of them would destroy Earth fighting an un-win-able fight.  I'm not saying the movie should have followed that formula, but the heart of your main character should should remain true to the past 70 years.<br /><br />Movie should have been 30 minutes shorter and should have toned down the action a lot.<br /><br />I know lots of people liked this movie.  That's too bad.  I wish it would have tanked so Zack Snyder didn't get the opportunity to screw Batman up as well.
0738711500|3.0|too much reading involved.. I wanted something with a simple form of readying the cards. It comes with a big book and to many things that you have to keep referring to. You have to go back and forth in the book. I wanted simplified, easy, one page reference..
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Much better than the original.  Original story and great action.  Kept me engaged the entire film.  Very entertaining.  I recommend watching it if you are an action/sci-fi fan.
B007IK44CK|4.0|The usual thrills and action. But what I liked most about this Mission: Impossible was the injection of some humor and smarts that were missing in the previous ones.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Can't wait for the sequel!!  This is the best superhero action movie yet. I highly recommend this to comics fans, action movie fans, fantasy/sci-fi fans.
B004XVN1T4|3.0|I'm a huge Ken Follett fan, and normally I devour it like popcorn at a summer action flick.<br />This book was certainly riveting and entertaining, but it was a bit too formulaic for my taste, and the characters either too predictable or too shallow.  If you're a Follett fan, you will definitely enjoy it for its action and well-penned romantic encounters, but might be a bit disappointed by some of the plot choices.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|The best of the Stones!!  What more can I say?  If you get this, be sure to CRANK IT UP!
1932100660|5.0|A must read for anyone who views nutrition as the best medicine. This is truly an eye opener. I have been following these guidelines for the past year with remarkable results.
B00000F6LQ|5.0|Classic movie with bonuses. One of the best bonuses is they actually include the entire screenplay in book form! If there is a part when you're laughing so hard you miss all of the jokes, go to the screenplay! Definitely recommend this version with all of the extra!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Love the show. Had to own the DVd's. Now I can watch my favorite parts over and over and over.....
B008602KQI|5.0|my daughter says its great and read the book first, she watched it a few times, Very cool movie. yaaa
B005F2BBLK|4.0|Great family movie for a rainy Sunday afternoon. Entertaining and witty on 2 levels, children and adult. Would watch again
B004X80QNG|4.0|I do not know how to use it. It should teach you how to I will keep trying. But what is the point.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I could not get FB app installed on my older Viewsonic Gtab. I tried everything but it just would not work. Full Facebook Free installed with no issues and works great every time. Great app!!!
B00ENYUA90|3.0|It was alright.  I was looking to see Travolta take on the other soldiers in the unit. It was alright
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Interesting band with good lifespan. Eclectic music reaches many age ranges. Bought the Second Law album too..sounds sort of like ELO of the 70&#34;s and 80&#34;s with a bit more edge.
0307387178|5.0|Easily one of my favorite movies.  This book is told in the authors point of view as he visits with people Chris came in contact with in his journey.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Great modern sounds from a band that has been around. Reaches all age ranges . Ordered the Black Holes & Revelations too.
1570627215|5.0|Very inspiring and deep.  Story of a personal journey that reminds us that there is no clear path in life.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I just loved Don, the main character.  Well crafted book which was laugh out loud funny.  Had to read it twice and loved it the second time, even more.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|this has adorable graphics but very little control to the main character for driving through the game route, could be a lot more<br />fun if the character actually went where you wanted him too.  I was bored from the beginning
B004GYY714|5.0|The amount of music, news, entertainment on TuneIn Radio boggles<br />the mind.....this is a fabulous app for my Kindle Fire and my Android<br />Phone..........just love it!
B000002HH9|4.0|I was not really captured by this Cure album before I reached  track 7, the quiet and wistful \\"Jupiter Crash\\", which to me still is the absolute highlight of the album. The songs has an unusually long intro, and you may at first expect it to be an instrumental. After about two minutes, happily this turns out not be to be the case, but rather one of their most moving songs, both melodically and lyrically.<br /><br />After discovering \\"Jupiter Crash\\", I obviously had to check out on whether there was something I missed at the first listen, and as always there obviously was.<br /><br />The waltzing \\"This is a Lie\\", with a fine string arrangement is one of the album's nice and quiet numbers. \\"The 13th\\" with its distinctive Latin-beat actually reminds me of one of my big favorites, Alex Chilton.<br /><br />\\"Strange Attraction\\", with its reggae beat one of the most catchy numbers and it was indeed released on single. The other singles were \\"Mint Car\\" and \\"Gone\\", featuring a funky, jazzy, trumpet arrangement. Neither of these numbers, however, belong to my real favorites.<br /><br />More ska horns you will find on \\"Return\\"; a little too much, though, for my taste.<br /><br />Then rather the slightly Suede-like rocker \\"Trap\\" which brings The Cure back to a simpler expression.<br /><br />The album ends with two subdued tracks, \\"Treasure\\" and \\"Just\\" - maybe not numbers that at first seem particularly remarkable, but especially \\"Treasure\\" with great violins have evolved to be another one of my big favorites.<br /><br />A conclusion could be that this is an album that wants explore a whole lot of different styles and arrangements, and not all of it works equally well. But with numbers like \\"Jupiter Crash\\", \\"Treasure\\", \\"This is a Lie\\" and \\"Strange Attraction\\" you can't go completely wrong with \\"Wild Mood Swings\\".
B005XDHNF4|5.0|My son and his wife loved these!  They're absolutely adorable.  It's the perfect shower/engagement/wedding add-on gift.  Any Lego fan will love it.
B004FHCH9Q|1.0|terrible waste of money........won't even give it to anyone else to bother seeing.  I felt the summary was terribly deceiving.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Set-up was a breeze once I got the wireless on my computer properly configured. That would be my only hint on this product. Make sure you are already connected wirelessly through the device you are setting the Chromecast up on. Otherwise, enjoying my new toy.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|We got the game because it had gotten good reviews and we were not disappointed!! My kids LOVE it!  I am very pleased with the amount of different educational skills it teaches the kids.  The characters are darlings, the sounds are cute, and graphics are age appropriate.  I highly recommend the game for anyone with little kids.
B009KUWWW0|5.0|Not for the feint of heart, this 1124 page epic, the last in the trilogy, creates a palpable history of the dark,middle ages. Follett's characters come alive in the first book and each book continues the saga of several families  giving the reader a real sense of this historical era. This last book continues the mural of the feudal system and the bravery of the common men and women who withstood insufferable political treachery.  I am a fan.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Even with it being made in the 60's and the special effects non existent its a must see show if your into sci fi
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|glitzy special effects and gratuitous violence & nothing more. Waste of time if you're into that. If you want to watch a shooter video game cuz you're too lazy to pull the trigger yourself, watch this instead.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is one of the best discoveries I have found. Just the right amount of light too. I can actually see it and it's not blurry without my glasses on. Large  enough to see from a distance. Fantastic!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|love this sees  have them all. cant wait until season 4 starts in October.  incredible acting and situations that really get you thinking about what would happen if the grid went down
B00DBSZ6ZC|4.0|Nice action movie, and good twist on plot. Acting was good and cgi wasn't a distraction. I would watch again.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|loved the movie.. what can i say?  picture was clear and not problems with the delivery of the movie  price was right too
B0020MKTOS|5.0|It's a little different watching him as a grouchy old man !<br />He does it with finesse...this is an awesome movie !
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|Of course it's Trent Reznor and everything he creates is amazing. There are no aggressive songs at all on this album and it is very poppy compared to a normal NIN sound. Still good and recommend it to anyone, but if you want something heavier and faster then not this album.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This production of Pride & Prejudice is my favorite- Colin Firth is perfect as Mr. Darcy and the rest of the cast as well.  The young girls are as irritating as they can be, which is the way the story is written.<br />Enjoyed it immensely.
B004V6X90W|4.0|Fun story to watch.  The shock for me...it was a true story.  Story deals with the big GAY issue so the movie is very timely and fun to watch regardless of how you feel about gays in the neighbood.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This was out of the box and working within 10 minutes. The audio and video was as good as HD as I've ever seen ( Toshiba Regza 46&#34; LED) It's cool to be able to broadcast from my lap top and continue to surf other web sites. I think Google will add some neat twists and this will last for quite a while. My iphone recognized it right away and I can play YouTube and Netflix immediately with superb clarity. I hope to be able to use it with my Amazon Prime soon. Hint, hint Amazon.<br /> I also received two free months of Netflix even though I am already a subscriber. My account was credited for two months. What a bargain!
B004X80QNG|1.0|I found this like many as FAOTD.  That being said, I got my money's worth.  The add says you can sync, but like the other reviews I found... you cannot.  Out dated, as a new version has been released.  No help files, or support.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|It's a cool game that is pretty simple to understand. I love search and find games so this is right up my alley
B008IEFP1E|3.0|I like most of the songs on this album. Some of them I keep in a loop because they have become my favorites.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The plots are great; entertaining and I couldn't wait to watch the next one.  Attractive characters and nice setting in NY.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|This is a must see movie!  It is in French with captions and still enjoyable!  It is a realistic and touching movie about real life situations.  People from different walks somehow come together and learn from each other, encourage each other to live beyond their dreams, and celebrate life together.  You Must See This Movie!  There is nothing like it out there in movie land.  I heard that an American version is planned but I doubt it will come close to this original.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|My kids and I  have watched this 3 times in a weekend!  We even ordered the game on kindle to play on the road.
B005VPRET4|5.0|She loved them, couldn't find in stores any where was sold out. Only thing she ask for. Had to find
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I like the challenge and the large variety and the easy game play. It's really approachable and easy to play and use.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is one of the most moving films I have seen in a long time. How amazing it was just that Rodriguez was ever discovered, considering the circumstances, and then how his life unfolded. I highly recommend this film to anyone with any musical inclination at all. It's inspirational, as well as touches the heart deeply. Also, as a psychological mystery of who this man is.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The best thriller I've read all year!  It was so good I went online and bought her first book which I'm currently readying (and loving too).
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I really enjoyed the game. The graphics are good. The kids enjoy playing the game. I would recommend this game to others.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|This was fun and all at first and then, as other reveiws said, when I got to level 30 and advanced, the game crashed!!! Then every time I had to redownload the game. eventually I deleted it and reinstalled it but it wasn't the same. I was on level 36. So just beware level 30!!!!!!!
B009C7JS14|4.0|I have yet to find an app that will show a weather map along with the current and future weather in more than one city at a time. I do like this app it is almost there.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV. Great show. Great characters. Great plot. Sex women. Sexy men. Hammer down.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|I love cheesy Sci-Fi and this series completely captivated me.If you love Sci-Fi (cheesy or not) give this series a look see.
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|This was another great MOBEST escape game.  A bit challenging but can be done.  Just hope they make them with more levels.  I recommend this escape game. I would have given it 5 stars if it had more levels.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|He loves this book.  He was worried it was above his reading level but either way, he is totally engrossed in it and ready to move on to the next book.
B008469DGY|4.0|Just started, but it's addicting.  Wondering if it needs more courses?  Didn't seem like too many.  Maybe more will be developed soon?
1590171993|5.0|Stoner, by John Williams, is a very tenderly written piece of fiction that follows the life of a young academic from the time he enters university as an undergraduate, through his marriage and academic career, and to his death at the age of 65. William Stoner, the book's protagonist, was raised on a farm by salt-of-the-earth, hard-working farming parents. At the suggestion of the local agricultural agent he enrolled in the new agricultural college at the University of Missouri in Columbia in 1910, but inspired by a dedicated professor in a compulsory course in English he changed his major from soil chemistry to the study of English and then went on to do a Master's and Doctorate in English, finishing the latter toward the end of the First World War.<br /><br />Stoner is offered a position in the English Department at the University of Missouri at Columbia and becomes a highly dedicated teacher and scholar, but does not publish much and lacks the ambition and forceful personality necessary to succeed as an academic or administrator. He soon marries an attractive woman without much consideration, is quite passive in dealing with her neurotic behaviour and demands, and is ultimately crushed by her. In his work situation he takes a principled stand by flunking a young graduate student in one of his courses, but shows little flexibility  or understanding of university politics in dealing with the student's mentor - a brilliant but vindicatively neurotic faculty member who eventually becomes chairman of his department and his mortal enemy.<br /><br />Stoner trudges through his failed marriage and his wife's manipulations that alienate him from his young daughter and the punitive teaching schedule that is imposed on him by his departmental nemesis. He eventually finds happiness and the true love for which he has been searching in an affair with a graduate student, but loses this glimpse of a meaningful life when he bows to the social pressures put on him by the universityand particularly his departmental tormentor. Deprived of this love Stoner withers away, although he finds a modicum of pleasure in his academic routine and his somewhat less neurotic family life. The indignity inflicted on him by his departmental chair to retire at the mandatory age of 65, by not granting him a complimentary two-year extension, eventually leads to his relatively early death.<br /><br />First published in 1965, Stoner belongs to the genre of campus novels associated with Kingsley Amis (Lucky Jim), Malcolm Bradbury (The History Man), David Lodge (Changing Places), as well as a recent novel by Mary Smetley (Lorenzostein, A Bizarre Tale of the Depravity of a Young Academic), although it is a marked contrast to these other works in its total sincerity and lack of humour and satirical bent.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The book was very good and I enjoyed it.  I found, however, that if I couldn't read it for a few days I had a hard time remembering what time period the chapter was in and which characters were involved.  Events would be described and then they would intertwine with events that were in several chapters before.  I found that confusing when several days would go between reading.  Other than that, it was well written and I really enjoyed it.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|It had some really funny parts. A lot of it reminded me of  when I was pregnant. Anyone with kids would find many things similar  to experiences in this movie
8562022268|4.0|I hunted around awhile trying to find the best edition of Orthodoxy for my personal library, and this won out for cost and design. I was a little suprised by the textbooky impression it gives in person, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. A little bigger than I imagined (I didn't read the specs) which allows for large margins which are nice for notes if you're that kind of reader. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase, and of course I really love the book itself, with all the interesting paradoxes presented.
B008602KQI|5.0|It wasn't what I expected..I didn't think I would like it, that is why it took me so long to watch it.
1576875776|5.0|Beautiful photography. Beautiful woman. This book became one of my favorite art books the moment I received it. I recommend it to any and all artists and non-artists.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Good action.  Fun.  Core characters once again live up to their Classic Trek counterparts.  The villian was OK, but Ricardo Montalban still remains the best Trek villian.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|What can be better than massive aliens being pummeled by giant robots? A thundering soundtrack to go with it. I've played the soundtrack 5 or 6 times in the week that I've owned it, each song out-gunning the previous. Definitely a solid addition to any action movie soundtrack collection, and an all-around great set of cuts to clean, workout, or go on road trips with.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love these guys,,so a game was with them is great<br />my grandson loves it to. he plays games on my kindle all the time
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Not much to say. Perfect set list. Great camera shots. Solid, thundering sound. Get it, get it, get it! For all you rockers out there, this is AC/DC rockin' hard.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|I thought it would be a little more action but Cruise is still a bad MF. Is there nothing this guy can't do? I was also delighted to see the Keysi fighting style used again.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|The book was slow. There were enjoyable parts but overall I would not recommend it. But, I always finish a book I start.
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|just not up to par for such a fine actor.  i have seen much from him.  hope his next one is better
B004X80QNG|2.0|Making an outdated version &quot;The Free App of the Day&quot; without disclosing it upfront makes it deserve a low rating.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|anything this man plays in is great.  just wish the series had to end so soon. would like more of it
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|It is great for improving for keeping my brain sharp.  I enjoy doing the different games, they are ever changing
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this controller as a 2nd controller for a refurbished machine which included only one refurbished controller.  Not being a stranger to controllers for Playstation consoles it's every bit as good as any OEM Playstation controller that I've ever handled.<br /><br />A few of the interesting details that I noticed is that the &#34;Charcoal Black&#34; finish is slightly textured and matches the body of the slim PS3 very nicely—though it may eventually wear smooth where the hands contact it within a few years).  Also, I've noticed that the battery on this is extremely good and outlasts the 6-8 hours of use that the refurbished controller lasts so I find myself charging it a lot less frequently than the refurbished one.<br /><br />One thing that I found a bit unfortunate is that my particular unit—this may just be how mine was assembled or how the plastic was polished—was that creaks a little when the grips are squeezed with moderate force.  It's really a minor thing, but other people's OEM PS3 controllers haven't made any creaking what so ever and neither does the refurbished one.  It'll likely settle in a bit and stop creaking as the controller gets used a bit more.<br /><br />Overall it's really hard to beat an OEM Playstation controller in terms of build quality and overall feel—I've yet to find an aftermarket controller with a similar button layout that feels as good in my hands.
0786956291|5.0|The gods be praised!!! WHAT A FLASH BACK! I'm teaching my students to play with this material and it is just perfect! 100% recomended.
B006IND5M8|3.0|A good action plot which doesn't require much brain power to enjoy. A weak script considering the two power stars, Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Amazing game. Great towers upgrades and agents. Levels can be tricky or hard depending on the difficulty you choose. Like I said amazing game.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Wonderful English characters.  Each season presented an exciting episode that kept you in suspense. I was constantly anxious to watch what going to happen next. Great Movie which I highly recommend to watch.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|After watching only Episode 1, Season 1. Entertaining and aesthetically pleasing. Love Elaine Atkins. One can't help but compare to Downton Abbey. You just don't care about these characters as much. However, it does avoid a level of melodrama that DA descends too, which is a relief. It also has the promise of dealing with racial issues, which will be interesting to watch play out.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|LOVE IT, EXCITING, GREAT ACTION AND SPECIAL EFFECTS, SUSPENSE, DRAMA EVERYTHING, DENZEL LOOKS AMAZING AS ALWAYS, A MUST SEE MOVIE
B00CAUH7UE|5.0|The main message of the book is hopeful. I mean, it is great to see evidence that people that are open to the need of colleagues as well as customers can be winners in career, not only the selfish geniuses ;-)
B007BVOEPI|4.0|IT IS A GREAT SERIES BUT OFTEN HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEING SAID DUE TO ACCENTS BUT IT HAS SUSPENSE, DRAMA, A BIT OF COMEDY AND STRONG VIOLENCE
B00BTWCKGA|5.0|I've seen Stryper live in concert twice, and I quickly realized they are one of the few bands that sound just as good live as they do on their recordings, if not better.  In my opinion, Michael Sweet has one of the greatest rock voices of all time, and 25 years after the band was at their pinnacle, he still hits those notes just like he always has.  This concert has a nice set list of familiar songs mixed with a few \\"B-sides\\", and their performance is top notch throughout.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|MIND BENDING, EXCITING, TONS OF ACTION, GREAT ACTING ON ALL PARTS, YOU MAY NEED TO WATCH IT AGAIN BECAUSE IT REQUIRES SOME THINKING, MADE MY BRAIN HURT THOUGHT, GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS
B004EWFUQY|5.0|The book was easy to follow and the diet plan very user friendly in terms of the variety of foods and great cooking ideas.I lost 7lbs in  5 days on the attack phase and feel very energize.
B000MR1V22|5.0|If you find humor in dysfunctional family situations you will enjoy this movie about a struggling extended family of misfits.  A wannabe author of a self-help book, supportive but overworked mother, broody, non-speaking teenager, 60's generation liberal grandfather, newly released gay uncle on suicide watch, and a sweet, baby-faced little beauty pageant contestant who doesn't quite fit the mold caravan in a old VW bus from Albuquerque to California for the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.  Almost as many tragedies as the Griswalds experienced on the way to Wally World befall the Hoovers along the road to California!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|its okay. not my fave but not bad. I prefer epic. for me that is more fun. but this one isn't too bad.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack has been great for my equipment and has help up great so far.  I am thinking about purchasing another one soon, to have for more equipment.
B003L77G06|5.0|For some reason I had a hard time finding a real copy of this season. After several fake copies that would only play some the DVDs on certain DVD players I ordered this DVD and I am so glad I did. It is a funny show. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
0316201545|5.0|Completely incredible so far.  While it may lack the more sophisticated prose found in the classics I usually favor, The Land of Stories is funny and heart-warming, and I highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game and was really disappointed when I reached level 10 and it was over.  A nice challenge for all of the gamers out there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series really had me hooked. The first book really knocked my socks off. The concept felt fresh and not a rehash of old plots.
B00E978FGQ|2.0|So many good actors for one of the worst written and directed movies of the year.<br /><br />Effects/magic are craptacular. Why, oh why did I pay for this??
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|This is just your basic Adobe reader. Nothing too fancy about it. Not really much to review for this product.
140006922X|5.0|Whao!.  I have never read any piece of literature so well researched and believable. Given the fact that one can present any point of view one wants from the Bible, Reza's view points are honest and authentic. He presented the real history  of how the gospels were written, shifting the shaft from the real. Thus, of the four cannonized gospels of the New Testament,the gospel of Mark was the fundamental upon which the gospels of Matthew and John were rewritten, and the gospel of Luke ( a disciple of Paul ) added all the other controversies.<br /><br />From this presentation, it is easy to truly follow the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth.  Reza has written the most important book of the Christian religion. His work, in my view truly complements the Bible.  Both should always be read together.<br /><br />Thanks for finally revealing the truth.<br /><br />Foluso Allison
B0058W74UY|1.0|It was a free a download so I wasn't hoping for much. But this flash player did not work for me.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Really enjoyed the angle the author took to lay out the story. Hearing all the different perspectives from all over the world gave the novel an epic and grand feel.<br /><br />Well written and surprisingly insightful.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|It is fun game but it is just basic. You can only move forward and backward. Only block and throw straight punches. But it was the free game of the day.
B002LVVCQM|4.0|Once again Richard Dawkins provides insight into complex ideas using language easily understood by the non scientist. Well written, bright and very informative.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I don't recall them mentioning his son in any of the previous Die Hards. This movie was just okay to me. The plot had to many twist and turns. Hopefully this will be the last movie in the franchise and Die Hard will finally die.
0307454568|5.0|This is a great read in a series of 3 books ~ The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  Was in excellent condition and at a good price.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I'm at a point in my life where I need to make certain decisions to make goals & life dreams come true. This book has definitely made an impact on those decisions. I have realized what I want and am going forward with my dreams. If you need to find your 'Personal Legend', read this book. It's amazing!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never read a story that makes me ache so much! Augustus love for Hazel is so raw and amazing! I probably can't ever read this story again but it will always be in my heart!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this game it's very addicting, it keeps you playing to try to beat your last score.  I wish there you could disable the ads . They get very annoying.
B008469DGY|5.0|Addictive fun, challenging entertainment, if you can not be on the links you might as well imagine the different courses and dream of the hole in ones.  Great fun  Don
B0040I09RM|5.0|The Sons of Anarchy is a great show! I just started watching last week and it had me hooked right away!
B00005OMTT|5.0|we really enjoy our time listening to this music... going to get more like this soon... I don't think we will ever get tired of this music!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Uno is fun, and even though it has ads, it lets you skip them instead of having to wait fifteen seconds before you can continue!
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I have enjoyed this book mainly because it iterates through many ideas and concepts that I personally believe as well.  I have gained some additional ideas and started to question how I approach some projects as well.  Regardless of the way your creativity is manifest you will find this book inspiring, entertaining, and thought provoking.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Steam is the future of all serious gaming. It has a great community and great deals. It is a must have for any gamer!
B000RO9VJK|4.0|The book is effective at selling the concept of systems in business. As opposed to many other books on management and leadership, E-myth has the small business owner in mind. The story of an individual's struggles in business is woven into the lessons taught by the author. A recommended read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have a blast playing this game with my kids, wish there was more depth to it though. All in all a blast.
B004UID2LC|3.0|The downloader downloads the songs I want and they play just fine, but I can't skip through parts of the song because it says that the song is at play time 0:00 out of 0:00. That's really the only thing that needs fixed.
B005544TRQ|5.0|what a great series!!!  I really like and dislike the characters in this series.  I cant wait to watch some more episodes.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I use this primarily when I am in bed at night. I can read very easily with this on. It illuminates the pages making reading just as easy as in daytime. It is also great for looking for anything that is missing in the dark.<br /><br />I don't have the ability to use one of the lights, though, simply because my kindle doesn't have a camera.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Aloha, this app pretty challenge and fun. I enjoy puzzles where if I get stuck I'll put it down, come back and the solution comes to me.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It captures you in. I felt like I was there in the mixed of it all. I had a very hard time putting it down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The entire season was fantastic!  It always presents a twist or turn when needed.  The season finale really left me dying for the start of the next season.  Definitely a winner!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|She hates to read, I know, so I read it out loud to her.  I absolutely loved this book!!!  So worth the read!
1119963192|5.0|It is a fantastic book of great professionals to be recomended to swimmers, triathlets and coaches on such areas. I feel lucky for having the possibility of profiting of such a marvellous book. Domingos L.Pinto-Coelho
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|As someone who has experienced these thing's, I often forget it can be done. Thanks for the reminder! I will use this information and reaffirm my belief in the field of energy we all possess. I have stated before my own books will become best sellers. I am patiently waiting for them to hit the best seller list.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The cast of this series is amazing...Jonathan Myers is an amazing actor, his role was truly convincing. I had a hard time trying to separate fact from fiction. Its based off the life of Henry V111, the script was well written, and acted out amazingly by every actor or actress that appeared in the series.
B008JFUO36|1.0|Great scenery and some interesting special effects CANNOT save this movie from the flimsy plot and from the even more flimsy acting of Tom Cruise. Felt WAY longer than it is.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman's part is barely more than a cameo.  Giant holes in the plot, and really crummy acting by Tom Cruise.  Any other actor could have done better.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|A dictionary that not only has millions of words, but has names too, Though it's just a dictionary. The end
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Karl Urban does a great job playing Dredd in my opinion.  Not that the character of Dredd requires much range.  I'm not sure he could have pulled it off without the helmet though.  Fan's have an expectation of what Dredd should look like which is only one of the reasons the Stallone film was an abomination.  The  story line is exactly what you'd expect from a Dredd comic book.  Very gritty with loads violence.  The CGI is mostly pretty good but there are some renderings that are obviously wrong.  Despite these shortcoming, it's a pretty honest portrayal of the comic.  Which is why I give it four stars.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this because my son is reading it in school and couldn't put it down. Worth every page. We should all strive to be kinder as the book implores us to do with its message.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Alas dear Zoolander,<br />you look great<br />You have a hard time with turning both directions<br />so go get a orange mocha frappacino!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Was a fun book and I enjoyed reading it. Nice if you're looking for a fantasy word to explore. Enjoyed the book!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Let  me start by saying I am not a big google fan as I am far too impatient to sort through a bazillion search results. However, I do like to have the option for internet searches and this does work for that. A magnifying glass would be helpful...
B005ML9YOU|5.0|Doyle was a superb storyteller.  He captures your attention at once and doesn't let go until the final period. I can finish a story or a book of the Holmes canon and be perfectly happy to turn back to page one and start over with no wandering of attention.  Purchasers should note that this is a truly complete collection -- four novels and 56 short stories.  There are some on offer that claim to be complete, but are missing &#34;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes.&#34;  This version has few typos and a fully navigable table of contents.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|It is a smart, sexy, enthusiastic comedy.  Well acted and appealing to anyone who loves to watch morning television.  Rachel McAdams can be in any movie and hold her own with any actor out there.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love this show!! lots of changes and scares in this season, but if your an addict like me then this is no reason to stop now!!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have seen many adaptations of Pride and Prejudice.  One in particular I am very fond of, so, I was ready not to like this version.  However, it captivated me and I loved the realism they took great pains to bring to the story.  Acting was excellent.  Cast choice, spot on.  I'm ashamed to say, I have watched it multiple times.  in one word........ Classic!
B008J05EL8|5.0|i bought this for my kindle in the hope that i could use it for notes in college.  It's perfect, i can do an awful lot, i haven't run into many problems at all, easy to use and i can do word, excel, powerpoint, etc with this app.  Must buy!!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I didn't get to the theater when the movie came out. I heard so many good things about it I just had to rent it. I am so glad I did. Everything I heard about it was true. So happy I finally got to see it. It was even better than what I expected. The fact that I got to watch it at home at a fraction of the price of a movie and didn't have to pay some crazy price for popcorn ( I could put all the butter on it I wanted ) was fantastic. Think I will wait and rent all the movies I want to see. Enjoyed it so much more!!!!!
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|CASINO ROYALE is a truly innovative and totally captivating Bond film. Daniel Craig is terrific. He combines intellect, wit and brute force and always remains the brooding thinking man's Bond. I suppose CASINO ROYALE is a re-birth or re-introduction of the series some ways and it works incredibly well. I was very impressed with David Arnold's score as well. He refers to the Bond theme very sparingly, yet it one of the best scores of the series. After DIE ANOTHER DAY took Bond in a different direction direction and pushing that envelope, CASINO ROYALE brings Bond to a more reality based world where a hero relies on his own resourcefulness and ingenuity and runs with it.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Harry Hole is Scandinavian version of Harry Bosch. Great character, great story. Would love to see Hugh Laurie play both of these characters!
B0019IB0II|5.0|Such a great book. I'm a nurse and this book helped me change my outlook on how to better care for stroke patients!! Very interesting and enlightening too!
B00BG23LYS|5.0|Leaps and bounds better than their 2011 release \\"Blood Lust\\" (which wasn't bad), \\"Mind Control\\"<br /> rocks with authority & style, delivering nine totally engrossing, massive songs that cover every-<br /> thing from doom metal to psychedelic prog-rock.  The guitars have a majestically elevated roar<br /> that manifests itself with the power and \\"oomph\\" of classic hard rock chord structures.  There's<br /> an aura of fist-clenching strength in the sprawling, hard-edged Crazy Horse-styled six-string<br /> flare-ups.  The ever-present din of noise is guided by the growl of glam/punk/doom-drone<br /> melody.  Psychedelic mayhem is corralled and channeled through the band's vision of acid-<br /> dripped power rock, while the presence of pop/drone driven atmospherics fills the black hole with<br /> dark paisley love notes.  Absolutely perfect music for those bong-bowl moments that require the<br /> muscle of rock to drop like stars from space in a splatter pattern of smooth & pure, crunchy-hard<br /> flower power.  Out of Cambridge, England, the band references artists as diverse as Big Elf,<br /> UFOmammut, Pink Floyd, Neil Young, Naam, Black Sabbath, Baroness, Torche, White Manna,<br /> Spacemen 3, The Saint James Society, Kadavar.  This one is for the drugged-out guitar freaks, a<br /> killer treat for head-nodding, black light rockers.  -Excellent_
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical but this book lived up to the hype. Better than the movie and loved the background it contains.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|whoops meant to type that here. but great game in all. love the premise and the graphics. just fix the vouches if you can. thanks for the great game :)
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|This whole album grabbed me from the get go. Avenged Sevenfold has never been better, and after being a fan for a good long while, that's something that I can say with complete confidence. They sound much more natural and powerful with this epic album that almost seems to have a story. It's gripping, edgy, and one of my favorite albums released this year.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I loved this show...i was on the edge of my seat the whole time. If there is one thing the brits know how to do (and they know how to do a lot in my opinion) they know crime drama.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it. Love it!! LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />If you like period pieces this show be on your list. The story is very well written; overall. The dialogue is spot on and the actors are believable and not just dressed up in turn of the century costumes.  I can't wait for season 4.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is a 12yr and up movie, it was a fun and exciting movie very well done. Story line tight to the end.<br />It has a lot of action , good banter and the Hulk was hysterical.
B008EKMB82|5.0|What an extraordinary premise: Ruth, a novelist of Japanese descent living on the West Coast of Canada discovers the diary of a young Japanese girl (along with some other items and documents) washed ashore in a plastic-zip-lock bag. As Nao's story unfolds, Ruth's own issues of relationships, loss, writing ability, community, and communications come to the fore. Beautifully written, this is a book to recommend to anyone who likes to be immersed in a different world.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|My wife and I can't wait for the next season to come out on Blu-ray.  The acting, the story lines, and the historical context make for great &#34;stay-at-home&#34; date nights.
B008JF8O9M|3.0|Downloaded to my Kindle fire HD with no problems. Tried to print with my brother HL-2270DW laser printer. Found there is NO driver for this printer. Tried a couple other drivers with no luck. I was going to try the Pro version but the description says to try the free version first . The Pro version does not contain any additional drivers. THANK YOU for saving me some money and for your honesty. Since I can't use the app I deleated it.
141694737X|5.0|She loves pulling the tabs and seeing what is behind each one. She seems to grab for this book more than the others.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Have lots of tissues ready.  Would love to know what the future holds for all.
0689835604|5.0|One of my daughter's favorite books.  She like the ability to play with book as we are reading , it keeps her attention.
B007N85POS|4.0|Like all of the birds with anger management issues, this game provides minutes of wasteful bliss, flinging the avions into an ornathologists nightmare!
0061950726|5.0|I read this over night (that wasn't my intention) . . .once I got started I could not stop. Hated it when I realized it was over. Will be reading more by Ms. Kline  . . . such a great read!
B0087ZG7NO|4.0|Good quality flick for the whole family. Kind of lets your imagination run wild. Anybody ever wonder what dinosaur tasted like?
B00640UICA|5.0|I'm always looking for games my granddaughter can play so this one caught my eye by it's Characters.  She is 4 so she can only go so far but the adults are crazy about it.  So much so that I haven't seen my Kindle for over a week while they are completing all the levels!  Worth purchasing.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Another good example of escapism and total enjoyment for the family. Just a little on the hokey side tho, and not quite as good as the 'LOST WORLD\\".
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wanted a very simple calculator for everyday use, this app does the  job. I am happy that I with my choice.
B0045HCIYA|5.0|This un-edited version is completely better than the US version. Brings out the real story of striptease without being low class.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Fun, interesting and relevant to all of us navigating through this wonderful universe!  Ive had a lot of fun sharing my experiments with friends also onthe same path.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Nice movie. Nice stunts. Tom Cruise was awesome as usual. Liked the scene on Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Good One.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good story for those who don't wish to become lawyers.  Grisham does, however, weave a very nice somewhat untrue story.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie. Beautiful scenery.  Excellent story and wonderfully done. My 13 year old boy who reads ALOT liked it tons and commented &#34;I guess they still can make great movies and not just junk&#34;  Watch it!!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I was able to following instructions easily for preparing to load Candy Crush. However, the File Expert uploaded a virus on my Laptop and crashed my PC. I started receiving Pop-ups from various Tech Support Companies, stating my PC had been compromised: and in order to clean up my PC, there would be a cost of $79.00 to clean it.  Needless to it was still having problem after the cleaning and my security was also jeopardized. I contacted HP and the reset my laptop to the factory setting.  It has take two week and I am still reloading programs.<br /><br />Did not even get a chance to load the game on my Kindle Fire let alone play the game.<br /><br />I will never order or download any more games.  Lost to much information, caused to much stress.  Window 8 user. JWJ Chicgo
B00E1L9N8E|1.0|I love movies, I just do.  And I love good stories.  But what was done to this very good story with really good actors and done in high quality production, was a tragedy and I could care less about this story as presented.  It was cartoonish and overdone and seemed incongruous in it's presentation.  I'm very sorry that it wasn't better.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I think this is a must read for any science fiction fan.  I knew the story, I had seen two movies that were based on this book.  And, as is often the case, the book is better than the film!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I very happy with this app, very user friendly in my opinion, it's not too cluttered with information and data on the screen either so it's easy on the eyes.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I like this app because it tell more about me than any other dj app so that is why I like this app
B000HL093A|5.0|Anyone who thinks this film is about some kind of critique of violence or the media obviously wasn't watching.  This is about what it feels like to be a living, breathing thing, and having the power and limitlessness that comes with that.  If it's .005% Michael Moore, it's 2000000% Heart of Darkness, and twice as much spontaneous human combustion due to beholding the eyes of God.  A moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers.  It's just murder, all God's creatures do it.  Some of the Great Apes draw and quarter other animals just by pulling.  From where I'm standing, you're an ape.  We all got a demon living inside us, and the only thing that kills the demon...
B00CATSONE|4.0|I really liked this book, and I learned a lot about who Tesla was, and all his ideas were amazing. Great job making an interesting book.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|It was a fun and engaging movie, and then the bottom fell out of the plot at the end and got a bit weird.
B000U6BT40|4.0|Great show that involves scify perfection. Makes you think if there is a place out there like this on earth.
030758836X|2.0|Unlike a lot of people I guess, this book wasn't that great for me.  I just found it trite with a worn plot and characters not substantial enough.
B00BU18U82|5.0|very entertaining, you get to drive the tractors and evrything, but you have to buy the bigger tractor with the account money
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I don't understand all the negative reviews, if you read what the product offers then you should be more than happy with what its capable of.<br /><br />I set this up on my Galaxy S3, my Ipad, my gf's Kindle Fire and my laptop in 20 minutes max. I can see if your wireless is low end how this might be a pain. I have 15 mbps download and 3 mbps upload via WowTV and I swear the chromecast loads video faster than my laptop. I hooked this up to my Samsung bluray player on HDMI 2 and it worked great. When watching TV on HDMI 1 i could search for something to watch on my phone, tablet or laptop and hit the cast button and it switches inputs directly to chromecast and plays.<br /><br />All in all i am very happy with the purchase. BTW if Amazon is out of stock there are other options, I paid an extra 10 bucks at Tromo Electronics and got in in 6 days via Amazon.<br /><br />I hope they keep expanding this piece of technology. Very satisfied.
B009AY04A8|3.0|It's okay for a hidden object game.  There are problems: it gives you a penalty for random taps even when you are just moving the screen around, or zooming in or out; the dialogue is overly long and boring.  Both of these features can be turned off or skipped, but it would be better if they were just fixed.  Once you start skipping the dialogue, the game goes by pretty quickly and you can see how repetitive it really is.  I got this game during a free promo, so I can't complain, but I wouldn't recommend paying more than $0.99 for it.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|This is a real life story with a great outcome. Not really a comedy although there are funny moments, also poignant moments.<br />It is rare to see a film where the supporting roles are so strong which created a very well-rounded movie. One to watch again.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app gives a ton of info on the wireles access points in your immediate area.  When traveling it identifies open (unsecured) APs for public use at truck stops, gas stations and restaurants.  Relative signal strength, channels, security and SSID are just the beginning of the info provided by this excellent tool.  Check it out,...it won't dissappoint.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|I'm not so sure it is what it is cracked up to be. I am struggling to get through the first chapter. My hubby says the experiments are nothing new. So I will have to finish to give the best review that I can.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Used in the vertical position, this is a full-featured basic calculator.  Turn your device to the horizontal position, and the display morphs into a full- featured scientific calculator.  Looks and works just like the real thing.  Get the best of both worlds in calculating with the flip of your wrist using this handy app.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|A lot of 'finding nemo' in this one, but a nice twist.  Didn't recognize Adam Sandler until he picked up the uckelele
B0051MKNV8|5.0|I highly recommend this movie; in fact, I would place it in my top five of all time.  Descriptions of the movie undermine its true nature, as it is much more complex than it seems at face value.  Who wouldn't love to have access to the entirety of their brain?  The cinematography in this film is excellent and gives the viewer a true glimpse into the mind of the lead character while under the effects of the drug.  The first scene when the lead character first notices the effects of the drug is one of my favorites.  It has enough suspense to entice those who like action movies.  There are some parts of the film that require a suspension of disbelief, but those parts do not diminish the effectiveness of the movie.  It's an intense film; watch it after you've had a hot cup of java.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Dustin Hoffman did a great job directing.  Finding real musicians to perform live is such a treat!  can you really go wrong with maggie smith?
B00D3LA71K|5.0|A very well thought out and introspective movie. If you like story line then you will like this. If you need fighting and action, not for you.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|We enjoyed this movie when we were teens and now our kids love it too!  Would highly recommend for all ages!
B008VO3PA4|5.0|I think this was written in my house especially the one about the fat cat, and the one that did ???
B003DXSXCI|5.0|Of course this movie is dated, but the action and scenery are awesome. The big chase scene is one of the best Hollywood has ever produced and without computer graphics - who doesn't love the duel between the Mustang and Charger? Lastly, how can an Indy boy not love a hometown hero?
B005U9REFA|2.0|Finally broke down and watched this movie and it's so dumb!  Goofy music from David Bowie, terrible acting from Jennifer Connelly, and generally dorky Muppet characters.  It looks like a TV show, not a movie.  I have friends who adore it... but I think they saw it when they were kids and are nostalgic for it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this app.  Have had no issues at all.  Great features!  Love the choices of clocks and the brightness feature.  Definitely recommend.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This was a wonderful movie loved the music and the comedy  will watch it over and over again.  I recommend this movie
B009GX7IRA|5.0|One of the best thus far. Ziva and Tony rally have some chemistry not really seen since the days of Jenny as director.
B004X80QNG|2.0|the free app ofthedayseemedlikea great deal, but not when it is 2 versions prior and they are so many poor reviews!  After my own review this app is not what I need.  does not sync with google tasks or astrid. avoid.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|this program so far.  Intense at times.  Interesting and has some light moments.  Will have to see the rest of the seasons before giving any rating above like.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|This was so unexpected. It is a mystery, but in the most unconventional sense. It's a tremendously powerful story about love, and family, and life, but above all, about love. Grace and her daughter have been critically injured in a school fire, and while their bodies are being tended to in the hospital, Grace narrates the story of what is happening in the investigation. She and her daughter talk while their bodies lie unconscious, and they can follow what is happening with the rest of their family, the police, friends, and other persons of interest in the investigation. Grace is pursuing a parallel investigation at the same time into her understanding of her life, her family, and the manifestation of love in their relationships. It's a very moving story, at the same time as being a very gripping mystery. Highly recommend it. A bit evocotive of Alice Sebolt's (sp?) The Lovely Bones, in terms of the detachment (yet attachment) of the narrator in relation to the other characters, but the two novels are nothing alike.
0307730697|5.0|I could not put this book down. I actually laughed out loud and shed a tear. Wow, that has never happened. The love that he had for God, Family, and Country was shown in great examples of each. I am recommending this book to everyone. Awesome read
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I'm a Vin Diesel fan and a fan of all of the fast car movies that he has done. This movie brought back some actors from his previous movies as well as adding the Rock (Dwayne Johnson). Vin Diesel and the Rock seem to compliment each other very well in many of the actions scenes. If you have'nt see Fast and Furious 6, you need to see it. Its awesome.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|A talented cast and a solid plot line give the uninitiated (to comics) a fun and entertaining intro to the Avengers
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I loved it! Really romantic and tragic!  Reflects the book nicely. Leo is just amazing and is perfect for gatsby.
B003FSTN52|5.0|Great DVD!!!  Couldn't stop watching.  The drama seems so real, you expect one thing to happen; then something else does.  The actors are believable in their roles, funny and absolutely intense.  I'm waiting for season four so that I can find out what happens next!
B008JFUR10|5.0|The director Del Toro really went all out on this one. I am a fan of his earlier works but this one, after viewing, made me feel like a kid again. Great special effects and great storyline, need I say more.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Great!!!!  No commercials to get in the way of a good show.  Dramatic, revealing, on your seat suspense.  Believable and sincerely brings you to tears.
B00821OX98|4.0|some of the actions of the citizen soliders are just too stupied. One kid runs out to rescue a dog in battle.
B003L77G10|5.0|Loved the continuation of drama between characters.  They seem to honestly, get in and out of trouble with ease.  You never know what trick or legal loop hole will be used next.  Lots of fraternizing between co-workers in the firm which always lead to a crisis.  Loved it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great fun, great graphics and easy to use.  Only downfall is waiting for more energy to continue playing.  Would recommend to anyone who loves find it type games
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Preposterous story, full of ridiculous, highly contrived coincidences. Worse, it's full of faux observations about marriage that are made to sound deeply philosophical. There are so many cardboard characters, it's hard to keep them straight, let alone care about them.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I've used this on my laptop for some time and now have the app for kindle, never had any problems with it yet. One issue is that the bookmark-let so you can pin from a browser is only available through the Google play store so I can't get that on a kindle... searching is quick and the images are good sized for the tablet.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I always read reviews before I download anything free, paid, or faotd. This time I decided against the majority of poor reviews and downloaded anyways. I have a nexus 7 2012. This looks exactly like the screen shots for me. Not only that, it synced everything from my Google calender and contacts to the app. I really like the way it looks and the options it has. It doesn't seem to work right for Kindle owners, but if you have any other Android tablet you should try this out.
1609611543|5.0|This is a great book with extensive research to back up the need to go totally wheat-free. I experienced several \\"Aha!\\" moments as it finally clicked that eliminating wheat from my diet would help with several chronic health issues I have experienced for many years. I appreciated that Dr. Davis included healthy wheat-free recipes in the back of the book to start my wheat-free lifestyle.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|One of the defining traits of heavy metal is being bold and sometimes doing something that can surprise your fans from time to time. For Megadeth they tried it once in the late 1990s with the album 'Risk' Let me be blunt, not many Megadeth fans speak of that album. Still, the meaning behind the project was experimentation and taking a chanc. The result was five new albums with Megadeth doing what they do best. Now we look at Dave Mustanes' 14th album 'Supercolider'.<br /><br />I think the best way to describe this album is 'Risk 2' Don't start comparing it to 'Risk' from a sound standpoint, but from an idea. 'Supercolider' is a new experiment blending the familiar Megadeth sounds with more vocally driven tracks and some based around classic rock and blues elements. Is this the right direction for Megadeth, I can't say yes or no. Still this band has been making music for so long, who wants to stay stale and repetitive? These past few years there have been a lot of bands that have been taking this road, Rush, Iron Maiden and Daft Punk are just to name a few. Being original and constantly trying new things is what can allow a band to stand the test of time.<br /><br />Megadeth has released a lot of new albums for the last 11 years, but who knows what will happen next? This could be the last album we hear from Megadeth for the next 5 years for all we know. What I will say is this past album has made me curious about where they will go and like most of the bands I listen to, I will be there to listen when the next release arrives.
B0053O89IS|5.0|It came just as fast as I ordered it! I love Bones and had to get the seventh season to complete my season collection!
B001QERPDO|4.0|'The Script' is one of the most original bands to emerge on the scene in the last five years. I nice blend of hip-hip rhyme and soothing alternative. Up until now I was not the biggest fan of this Irish trio's debut, but I can rant a rave about the two follow up albums. It was after listening to '#3' that I wanted to give their first album another chance. It seems to me after all this time I was just not focusing on the right songs because as a while 'The Script' is a very enjoyable album.<br /><br />Of course we all know their first single in 'Breakeven' but there are some really great songs here. 'The End Where I Begin' & 'Fall For Anything' are by far the two best on this record. But there are such original songs on this record including 'We Cry' & 'Rusty Halo'. This album is far from perfect, but when you see how far these guys have come since then, I would have to say that 'The Script' is worthy of your collection and a good listen for a first timer.<br /><br />What can I say, everything deserves a second chance.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I travel a great deal and love having the local weather at my destination available. I am out of here!
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|Tim Burton is responsible for some of the most amazing films in history. His blend of spookiness and heart has given us some of the most amazing stories and memorable characters. Let's not forget one of the greatest actors of our time in Johnny Depp. Now after almost years of story telling Tim Burton is proud to finally give his fans a full length version of his cult classic short film 'Frankenweeie'<br /><br />It is the simple story of a friendship between a boy and his dog and how far you would be willing to go to keep someone close to you for the rest of your life. While this film does take from many elements of classic Hollywood monster films the heart is over abundant in this film. I will say this, Sparky aka Frankenweenie is the greatest of all Disney dogs thanks to this film. The story is so heartfelt and everything in this film makes it so wonderful. The stop motion animation, the Danny Elfman score and the classic black and white make it all the most visually stunning and memorable. It has a great cast, some Tim Burton favorites including Winona Ryder & Catherine O'Hara and of course the menagerie of house pets that each have their own unique personality.<br /><br />I will say that I was a little upset that this film didn't win best animated feature at the Oscars. Still, that won't prevent people from seeing this wonder of a film. I am so glad that after all these years this film has finally been made and they couldn't have picked a more perfect version than stop motion. If it wasn't for 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Sweeney Todd', 'Frankenweenie' would probably be my all time favorite Tim Burton film to date.
B00EQNYOYU|2.0|I was excited to get this album.  Especially since Trent Reznor has been getting a lot of press for this release.  Including on NPR.<br />I was playing it today and actually had to check and make sure I wasn't playing it on song-repeat... That is how similar all the songs are.  The beats are different, bit the part that makes it difficult to listen to is the fact that Trent sings in the same way on each song.<br /><br />I would recommend listening to all the samples before committing to the download.<br />Maybe you will like it, and maybe after more listens I will find something to like.<br />If I do, I will change my review, but for now I am over it.<br />Cheers,<br />B Rich<br />Blake
B00C061I3K|5.0|'Daft Punk' is amazing! I could stop right there if I wanted to, but I won't.<br /><br />After a successful attempt at film soundtracks, the French house duo is back with their fourth (well fifth if you count the Tron Legacy soundtrack) studio album in 'Random Access Memories' Not since I have heard their first mainstream single in 'One More Time' have I been excited about this band. 'R.A.M.' is probably the best album to hit this year. It sounds like Daft Punk is really working on something special because this album does not sound like anything they have done before. It is a blend of techno, disco and funk that just creates a celebration in your head when you listen to it. It includes a slew of guest singers and beats that make you want to listen to it over and over again. 'Get Lucky' is definitely the song that will suck you in , but once you get past that you will never want to stop. Songs like 'Doin' It Right, Give Life Back To Music, Fragments In Time, Lose Yourself To Dance and pretty much the rest of this album will fill you with an amazing feeling that will make you just want to get up and dance.<br /><br />I have no idea when we will get another album or even a soundtrack from Daft Punk. Still, expect this album to win a ton of awards and at least another single to be released in the future. Daft Punk revolutionized the club scene with their one of the kind style, and R.A.M. has basically told us, we haven't seen anything yet.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|This CD kicks major Ass! They can play like demons with songs sung  as haunting as angles. If you like S.N. your gonna be blown away.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I purchased this movie for my husband and he loves it! The Blu-ray is very high quality, as the picture is super clear! The story line is good, you'll stay interested the whole time. The ending leaves you hanging just a little, thinking perhaps there would be a part 2. Thumbs up for the Green Lantern!
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|wonderful new music from NIN Trent still has it these songs will sound fantastic live. I can not wait to see NIN live.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very good story involving three families.  The secret was a shocker when it was revealed.  I liked the way the author ended by writing about what could have been had this tragedy not happened which was very clever.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|This CD packs a punch with very singable music, I do not know how I missed this band for as long as I have, they are Very Good ,
0399226907|3.0|This book will help children understand the life and activities of some of the funny crawly creatures they see outdoors. The illustrations are good, but it's hard to get excited about them or about the text.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|Have you ever heard about pervs who watch women's tennis, just to hear the grunts? Well, when I overheard my two daughters (6 & 10) playing this game, (which I downloaded when it was FAOTD, based on reasonable permissions and positive reviews, as well as all-ages rating, and no in-app purchasing) I couldn't help but think that the developers have some fetishes of their own.....Now I never have observed an Asian porno myself, but hearing the grunts and moans that come from this game constantly, that is the only place these sounds are appropriate. Not in a children's app! I will be deleting it. Also, Toca Boca? What kind of a name is that? When I said it aloud, my husband thought it was a drug reference....
B0030MM68O|4.0|For the detractors, remember, this film is not billed as a documentary. It is a work of fiction that is well done overall.
B009R659L8|5.0|&#34;Daddy's Gone A Hunting&#34; was another hit for Ms. Clark with the suspense and drama that abounded all through the book.  A very good read, which I have archived to read again at a later date.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I love this fm transmitter. There is a little bit of a learning curve (hence the 4 stars) but it is awesome. It's takes a little while to learn how to work the buttons & it is slightly frustrating the the folders don't list in alphabetical order but other than that, I LOVE IT!! The station we set our radio on has not changed since we installed the device, like with other transmitters you are changing the station every time you drive through a new town. And the remote is very handy. I love that is wireless. I do wish it had move swivel in the \\"neck\\" but,  once again a very small issue to deal with. If you don't have an aux jack in your car not any other way to play your iPod YOU SHOULD BUY THIS!!
B008469DGY|5.0|Best free app.ever.  easily the best with absolutely no other app coming close. Loads of fun. Hope you didn't miss it.
B0035JRVBO|2.0|great soundtrack. but everything negative is on the female character Jenny. No good came from black power, alternative movements or the civil rights era? what? But a &#34;special&#34; man can accomplish anything.
B003B02PEU|5.0|I had read this book years ago and remembered enjoying it. I went on a lengthy road trip recently and decided I needed a page-turner (Don't worry, I was a passenger :) ). I got the audible that goes with it. I was glued to the book/audiobook the whole time I was on I-95. Thanks, Mr. Grisham!!!<br /><br />By the way, I picked up more of the nuances that I had forgotten. In addition, the voiceover artist did an excellent job with the audio portion.

0770437400|5.0|A sophisticated and highly interesting story about how the entire world is impacted by a plague that creates zombies. For anyone who is enamored of the topic, this is the book to read.
B000YAA68C|2.0|This is a very brief review - more to follow later.<br /><br />I struggled through watching this film to completion - first on an airplane on my Nook HD+ tablet and then in bed on the Nook at home.<br /><br />The very first part of the film that I found irritating was how a very critical event in the plot was handled.  I don't want to provide a spoiler, but suffice it to say that some major events happened within the first few minutes very abruptly.<br /><br />Hilary Swank as the lead is a less than appealing character.  Gerard Butler makes for great \\"eye candy\\".  The other characters were never developed, so there were many vague, boring and tedious aspects to the film.  I did not find Harry Connick, Jr. intriguing in his role at all.  The camerawork also did not shed an attractive light on Hilary Swank, either.  Her face looked very \\"horse-y\\" throughout much of the film.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|Fun game.  I have become addicted rather quickly. It runs smoothly and pretty seamlessly.  The only issue I have experienced is that there seems th be a little hiccup when the ads refresh that slightly interrupts play.  The game recovers easily and other than that the ads are not very intrusive.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had already read this book and loved it. I recently got a new kindle so I &#34;borrowed&#34; it and read it again - since the next movie is coming out soon.
B009NET0H8|5.0|The story of Vivian Maier blew my mind when I first came across the same in 2011. Since then, I wanted to buy this book ... but the print version was prohibitively expensive in India. But I kept tracking the price in the hope of buying it someday. I grabbed the Kindle edition as soon as I found it and was not disappointed. The reproduction is excellent; it provides a glimpse into Vivian Maier's genius ... though I must admit the book left me wanting more. Hope to see the second book also released in Kindle version soon
B00A8ECU24|1.0|bad game this game is not worth anybodys time bad bad bad no one play because if you do your a litter kid.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I would recommend this for all ages!  It is good clean fun, my kids love it, I love it, and so does my father, it is quiet addictive,
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|I LOVE the Offspring, and their latest album kept up to pace with what I have come to expect from them. Same vibe, great new beats.
1451627297|3.0|Great premise  coupled with compelling plot and characters... but somehow missed the mark for me.  I think mainly because it becomes so bogged down in the [SPOILER] love story between Jake/George and Sadie.  And Sadie -- at least in terms of how she is characterized on the audio CD -- comes off as a bit of a weak, whiny southern gal... even considering the time and place (the South in the early 60s).  I think the story is best when Jake/George is in full-on detective mode, and when the tension ramps up as he prepares to take out the villains he has time-traveled back to encounter.  The love that develops between Jake and Sadie, although obviously a key plot point (and central to the book's climax and coda), just never felt quite believable to me.  Of course, what's \\"believable\\" when the topic is time travel??!  :-)<br />Not King's best, and over-long, but there are worst books to listen to during a cross-country road trip I'm sure.<br />Three and 1/2 stars.
087033039X|5.0|his is a fine book with all of the information you need to braid rawhide. i would recommend it  for you
B004G6TD8Y|4.0|This was the first major live-in-concert stage work ever performed by erstwhile global supergroup ELP: an imaginative re-work of Modest Mussorgsky's `Pictures at an Exhibition'.  In the first two years of the group's life, it was the centrepiece of their stage show.<br /><br />The original recording is from Newcastle-on-Tyne City Hall in March 1971, released as a budget LP after the band's first two studio albums had established a sizeable fan base (the record company wanted to release it on their classical music label but relented under pressure from the band).<br /><br />The opening sequence features Keith Emerson playing Mussorgsky's `Promenade' on the huge Harrison pipe organ installed as a permanent fixture at the Newcastle venue, so it sounds like no other recorded performance of this piece. ELP base their version on Ravel's popular orchestration of the original piano score but add to it in several places, introducing vocal sections with Greg Lake singing unaccompanied and also playing acoustic guitar (one of the highlights) and a full-on danceable rock number `Blues Variation.' The gig rounds off with a rocking rendition of Tchaikovsky's `Nutcracker' - which the band title `Nutrocker'.<br /><br />The analogue recording quality and production is pretty darned good considering the state of technology in this pre-digital age, and the roaring enthusiasm of the appreciative audience is worthy of a cup final victory. There have been several updates and re-releases including a studio recording of the work, a `deluxe' edition with a lot of extra material and even a filmed performance at the London Lyceum. The original 1971 recording from Newcastle, however, is hard to beat.<br /><br />A classic from the 1970s in every sense of the word, this recording demonstrates `progressive rock' at its bombastic and self-important best. If you've never heard the music of this fine band, this would be a great place to start.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I was shopping around on my kindle, stumbled across this and its fun to use! The only downside is having it plugged in and on all of the time. (Great for traveling)

B0030ZRW9E|4.0|This is my first book I read on Kindle; I literally couldn't put the book down! (Or in this case, Kindle down)
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|Very well written & easy to follow style. Having fun learning with the guidance from this book. First it seemed a bit unusual, his introductions to chapters etc., but after getting accustomed to it, I seem to enjoy it before getting to the serioius part of learning.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Enjoyed this book a lot. Great adventure. Looking forward to all the others in the series. Good book for any age.
B00AHDXTIK|1.0|Simply put, just got it today, does not work for what I want. It charges for a minute or two before disconnecting.  Then I have to disconnect it and reconnect it a few times to get it to charge again.  In the end, I'm losing battery instead of gaining. Simply put, it does not work.<br /><br />Tested on multiple outlets, even tried my computer. Sometimes doesn't even show up in the list of devices when I go into itunes.<br /><br />It seems once you get it perfect, it will stay charged, but moving the ipad seems to disconnect it.  The point of getting a 3m cord is so I can use the ipad while charging it so being unable to move it around negates the point of having it in the first place.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Hints recharge quicker than other games. Fun game for the whole family. I think this game company has good hidden object games.
0440243688|5.0|A great read. Intense action and great characters. Reacher novels are always great, starting with a detective story and ending with non-stop action.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This book kept me engaged, which is hard to do.  It had me chuckle out loud numerous times, cry, get excited, and happy.  I loved it.  If you are a dog lover, you must read this.
0061703087|5.0|I read all of Michael Crichton books, and this one is my all time favorite. Crichton was such an amazing story teller and all his book were great, but this time the characters seem to leap off the page and demand you to keep reading. Crichton's ability to make us hate a character, and then immediately feel sorrow for them is what makes this one of his best books.
B00BW6SOIQ|3.0|I love James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal.  I thought the storyline would be somewhat 50 Shades of Grey but it wasn't and I was  bored.

B0082RHRHC|4.0|I read this in high school, but definitely should be read again as an adult.  It's amazing how all these years later, the story line still applies today.

B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This app takes way too long to load and then is not what I would call user friendly for kids. Not worth it!
B001DJLCPE|5.0|Kubrick can do anything it seems like. This is a very well thought out comedy and says a lot about the time period it was made in and the mass paranoia during that time. Hilarious and make sure you pay attention or you might miss a joke

B008M4MB8K|5.0|This movie is extremely thought provoking and will keep you thinking about it long after its over. My personal favorite sci fi movie of all time next to 2001 and of course Star Wars
0440423228|5.0|The adaptation continues to be well written and illustrated.  The art work continues to be wonderful.  For those watching and reading this in conjuction with the other formats, the book starts and ends in book/season 1 - game of thrones.  I plan on ordering the third volume when it becomes available.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|This is, yet again, another home run for one of the greatest movie makers of all time, Stanley Kubrick. This movie demonstrates how the Vietnam war affected every person in their own way and R. lee Ermey gives an insanely great performance. This could be one of the greatest war movies ever made.
B00DQVST76|5.0|This woman is unbelievable!! at 55 people wish they can look and move the way she does. The show was impressive and as always Madonna Let's us know she's still the Queen of pop and will always be. Imitators can keep trying to copy her style but it will always be reductive.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It allows you to use your brain. I would reccomend this app to all moms trying to give their kids something to put there minds too. it would keep them focus for hours...
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I am not sure how I happened to come across The Night Circus, by Erin Morgenstern, but it is a book that kept me reading all weekend. I was looking for a little steampunk or maybe an urban fantasy, and instead I found this morsel of exquisite beauty.<br /><br />This is an unusual book. It is most certainly not written in the dumbed-down 60-second sound-bites current wisdom tells us we must write all fantasy in. The beautiful, dreamlike prose is written with an Edwardian flair and care for the crafting of the words, yet it is written in modern English.<br /><br />The magic is completely unexplainable, and is meant to be that way. No believable explanations are given for how each of the protagonists create their magic. It is a performance, solely for the amazement of the reader and is completely in keeping with the mood and ambiance of the tale. I know I am a stickler for realistic magic systems but in this case I am letting that criteria slide, because the magic is not the point of the plot.<br /><br />The contest, the minor characters who are unaware they are caught up in the contest, and how Celia and Marco counter each other's moves is the central facet of the tale.<br /><br />The characters are not fully fleshed when they are set before you. Instead they are revealed slowly, with each revelation enticing you to stay riveted to the book.<br /><br />What IS fully fleshed is the dreamlike environment of Le Cirque des Rêves, the amazing, mysterious Circus of Dreams.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, dark and moody book. The characters and the Cirque des Rêves stay with you, long into your own dreams.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I liked the book especially the art work and how it depicted the many varied emotions. A good read for sure.
B003DZX3US|5.0|This movie is just as amazing as I remember from its original release.  I especially enjoyed the extended version with extra song that just seemed to tie everything together.
0694013013|5.0|I sent this to my 18 month old grandson who quickly learned to imitate all the animal actions in the book. His favorite was thumping his chest like a gorilla. As an Early Intervention Specialist working with 0-3 yrs of age, I use this book all the time. It's a great way to teach motor imitation, animal sounds, and capture toddlers'/preschoolers' attention.
B000065V42|5.0|The adventure in Honey I Shrunk the Kids brings us back to that time in our childhood when anything was possible and all the adventure we needed was right in our backyard.  As the adventure unfolds, the characters learn to love each other and themselves and stop worrying about peer/social pressures they begin to see themselves and others as they truly are.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Amazingly crafted.  Hated to put it down.  A roman de clef?  How did the author die, at such a young age?
B00E193TM2|5.0|This album is by far right up there with the original CD from ffdp. Love this CD if you've heard anything by them before and enjoyed it you will love this album
B00ESY77LO|1.0|I found the movie boring, but the really bad part was the music. Why would there be rap music in movie set in the 20's? I can't even fathom what they were thinking? I would have found this movie boring if the music wasn't so ridiculous, but my wife who wanted to rent the movie in the first place, said that the rap music just ruined the movie for her. It was filmed very beautify, and had potential to be a decent film. I guess the director must have felt that modern audiences wouldn't care for the actual music of the time period? I guess this is why American cinema sucks so badly today.
0061992860|5.0|At first I thought this book was too general but that's because it was covering things I already understood. I kept reading and going through it and I learned quite a bit. Definitely a great guide and its small size can fit in a pocket or an emergency bag.
B0029N92UU|5.0|I love this woman's voice!  If you are stressed out and need to relax, this is the CD to listen to.  Love it!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I genuinely thought this book was better than the movie. And that's saying a lot, because I love both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. I thought the movie focused way too much on the dance competition, where as the book focuses more on Pat's road to recovery. There were also a few twists in the book that were great, but otherwise the movie followed pretty close to the plot line. Essentially, Pat Peoples has spent the last 3 years in a recovery home, and has large chunks of his memory that are missing. He is still madly in love with his wife, who seemingly has left him. He has a few members of his support system that help him through the healing process, one being Tiffany, who is also recovering from loss of her own. It's a very quick, entertaining, and uplifting read. I would recommend this for someone that is going through a break up. It's a book about hope.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It was ok I think they could make it more entertaining but I like how you make money even when you're not playing it
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is a good game until you have had it for a while. Then it starts acting up and won't open it will just load them close by itself on a tablet and you can't play it  any more.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Believe it will serve it's purpose as a protective case for Kindle.  Like the option to enable kindle to stans up
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|While Mockingjay struck me as the darkest of the three, I was ultimately extremely satisfied with the whole of the story. Don't expect a happy ending, but do expect a thought-provoking one! I'm still mulling over what happened and considering the larger themes of the destructive uselessness of war and the nature of hope after one is confronted with the worst humanity has to offer.<br /><br />Do not sell yourself short and only read the first book - it is worth it to stick with it until the end.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This is a beautiful adaptation of one of my favorite books and I love the casting, local and otherwise. Jennifer Lawrence deserves the fame she gained from this role.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was as taken with Catching Fire as I was The Hunger Games, but (as per usual with series), there was a bit of time at the beginning taken up by refreshing our memory to what happened in the previous book. It usually annoys me and Collins didn't differentiate herself there.<br /><br />Regardless, she continued with a solid, well-written, engaging story that kept me flipping pages as quickly as I could. There is no doubt that you'll want to read the entire story, so plan on ponying up for the final book as well!
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Basically entertainment, this movie supplies nothing profound but you feel good at the end. Jennifer Lawrence did deserve her award for the role, it was a tough one and she nailed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well-written, engaging and surprising.<br /><br />I feel like I could talk about the themes and cultural significance of this book at length, but given its popularity, I know I wouldn't be the first. The only thing I have to add that may not have been said before is that I was surprised and delighted by the author's attitudes towards human bodies.<br /><br />SO much of pop culture is saturated by a concern for how we look and what other people think of us. Katniss is a breath of fresh air - a girl who is self-possessed and has no doubts about her right to exist in her own body, about the *rightness* of that body and what she can do with it.<br /><br />Katniss's perspective on the way that Capitol citizens decorate and change their bodies from their natural states is, quite frankly, refreshing. It's subtle, but for me it absolutely made the book. There is no body-shaming anywhere to be found, no value placed on looks, only on strength of character.<br /><br />What also struck me is that Collins handles the delicate situations where one could infer sexual intimacy between characters in a demure and delicate manner, allowing the reader to infer it if they so desire.<br /><br />Bottom line - I wouldn't hesitate to hand this to a girl of ANY age and recommend she read it. I'm sure that I'll be reading it again myself, many times.
B005723JSQ|4.0|a good easy read that I got through in just a couple days. maybe not quite shopaholic but a good read nonetheless.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book is well-written, thoughtful and honest. Piper Kerman's storytelling ability is solid. I'm always wary of reading new authors because of the risk of poor writing (especially when the subject matter is so intriguing)... but this book is great.  I started watching the Netflix series (but hadn't finished it) before I read the book. While I was, early on, occasionally stricken with nightmares over Piper's experiences as portrayed on-screen (don't get me wrong - it's great and I can't wait for season 2), reading this book made it so much easier to watch Kohan's dramatization!<br /><br />Absolutely worth the read, ESPECIALLY if you plan to or already have watched the show.
B00DGMVC4C|4.0|This game is very addictive. I love it~~ but one thing that I do not like is you are always starting over after you finished.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I love this season especially, the last episode. &#34;The Wedding of River Song&#34; was very cool. Though how the Doctor cheated death was kind of disappointing.
B00631HASU|4.0|I love the game but just like the Sparkle 2 at the end you have to start over. I thought it had a lot more levels.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|This is so preposterous that it is hard to watch. A lot of foul language and graphic violence. Not worth the time I spent
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For $35, this device does a lot. VERY easy setup on any TV with an HDMI port, small enough to fit in said ports, and even comes with an extension in case it doesn't. Google is making it easy for app companies to add in the Cast functionality, so even though there are not many apps that cast to the Chromecast, remember: it's a new device with many possibilities. And for $35? Great purchase.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I don't agree with everything (Jesus is the Son of God)<br />But the history is interesting. Great insight of the time<br />Jesus walked the earth.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Amazingly brilliant rendition - thought the book was great.  I was pleasantly surprised that the movie captured the essence of the book in a dellghtfully  magical way.
B00EPVTLKU|5.0|All I say is WOW this girl is seriously talented.  I agree with the review of this album I read that said she was a cross between Toni Braxton and Mariah Carey! She certainly seems to have Mariana range. I absolutely LOVE this debut album and listen to it when I'm not watching her amazing videos
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Just incredible. Jessica Lange is an amazing actress and makes this series what it is. I can't wait for the next season to come out.
B00EPL4PBK|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold has done it again! There's not a single track I skip! Highly recommended! I can't decide which track is my favorite!
B00B32X786|3.0|Lots of big name actors.  I found it a little boring and trite.  Gave it three stars because it is a classic and one of those movies with a few memorable moments.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Books were fabulous! Apparently waiting for book 4 to be released cause it left me \\"hanging\\" at the end of book 3!
B008R14YBK|5.0|shes very kid friendly.  I bought this used and it works great.  my daughter listens to this cd ALL THE TIME.  very happy with the purchase.
B0038P59A0|5.0|This was a fun, non-serious action movie with great casting in both Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law.  You can definitely see why Downey was picked to play Tony Stark.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This app is good if you want to touch up photos. Easy to use. I like the blemish tool the best.
B00C1BHQXK|4.0|Clear and powerful message that shows how narrowing areas of life to one thing at any given time promotes success, well-being and focus.
0765316994|1.0|The thesis of Redshirts is that it is possible to have an interesting SF novel without violence.  Unfortunately, Scalzi fails to prove this thesis.
1439102813|5.0|Still Alice shows Alzheimer's from the mind of the sufferer. Though it's fiction, it resonates with truth. The story left me more knowledgeable of those early signs of Alzheimer's of which to be aware. ​
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I have been a  fan of Dr. Who for many years, and look forward to many more.Thank you for providing this series!
B005544V6A|5.0|I had not been watching this show but heard many good things about it so I started with Season 1 and worked half way on Season 2.  Thank you Amazon Prime for making this possible.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Easy game; the time flies when I play it.  My 8 year old niece plays it with no problems.  I usually disable the sound so that I don't bother others. Definitely recommending for all.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This book kept pace with the other books in the series and was everything I'd hoped it would be and more.  Many thanks to the hard work that went into making this a reality.
0425166805|5.0|I read this book at the age of 10 years old and wanted to see if I would digest more now at 52. This book changed my viewpoint at 10 and still molds my thought patern today. I am glad this book is still in print. Anyone who questions modern religion dogmas and theories should read this book. They may find new answers to old question.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great mental and visual exercise. I will play this for days if not weeks. Highly recommend to those who like hidden object games.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Enjoyed the priests unwavering desire to secure the safety for the Jews trapped in Italy even though his own life was in peril.
B00006F83Y|5.0|I hadn't heard this until I ordered it but it is a must have cd.  Been in my car rotation since I bought it.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I do not like the Candy Crush Levels help guide. It doesn;t help at all. I can not even get into a level to look at the help,
B005544V6A|5.0|Fun, addictive show with an energetic and engaging cast. I was dubious at first but am now a full-scale &#34;Suits&#34; addict!
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Lots of action in the return of Arnold to the big screen. I know it did not do boffo box office, but it is a very entertaining movie. Arnold as a small town sheriff who's town is in the path of a ruthless cartel head in a crazy fast Corvette.
B008469DGY|5.0|Fun and challenging game that really works great on my Kindle Fire. Don't get fustrated because it takes alot of tries to get 30,000 points!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love it. Definitely one of my favorite books. Read more than a few times and will continue to read it!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I recently upgraded to a Galaxy S 4 and was excited about the phone until I used the keyboard. I have had SwiftKey on my G2X for years and was blown away by how &quot;dumb&quot;  new phones are. Needless to say, the first app I installed on my new phone was SwiftKey. Hell, even my non techie Girlfriend said &quot;oh wow, your phone guesses what I want to type!&quot;  I just smiled and said, I know. :-)  In a nutshell, get it.
B00CJGP116|5.0|Marc Anthony at his best. Fresh,Vibrant Vivir will be a future classic. Romantic and Smooth even the kids enjoy it!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this team ,  funny !  I don't watch much tv but this has me glued. Can't stop watching it.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Wonderful memories and still just as exciting as the first time I saw it. Looking forward to watching the next episode.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Love every cut. Beautifully recorded. One on the best voices in country music today!! So happy I purchased it!! Happy, happy, happy!!!!!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|alot better than i expected. good storyline, yet somewhat predictible twists. recommended if you like scifi and drama type movies
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was a required reading for my son's AP English class at school.  This opened up his 14 year old mind to understand life more than any other book he could have read.  I applaud his teacher for assigning this and strongly recommend it to anyone, but especially for teenagers or young adults.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|As a follow up to Justin's \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\" this CD has the same format but the sound is completely different from anything we've heard. I have to say this CD is not as good as his last album. I loved that CD from the first listen. This one took many listens... especially with \\"Suit and Tie\\" to like. Honestly the Singles are the best songs on the CD the others have strange arrangements with average lyrics. I do commend Justin for doing something different though and this sound will grow on me eventually. Top 5:<br /><br />5. Spaceship Coupe - This one is interesting but addictive. I can see a video of him in a Captain Kirk uniform and he's on a planet wooing an female alien like from the Star Trek Episode lol<br /><br />4. Tunnel Vision - Awesome song, Awful music video.<br /><br />3. Suit & Tie - This one took a while to grow on me. I just didn't think it stood out as a first single but now I think its good and classy, even with Jay'Z's rap.<br /><br />2. Blue Ocean Floor - This one is just beautiful. It really does sound like a song recorded underwater!! His vocals are on point and the sound is bit seductive. Im glad he didn't remix this one because its perfect the way it is.<br /><br />1. Mirrors - This sounds like it belongs on \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\" But its awesome. I can listen to it anytime but then when he flips the sound, the little rap the him and Timbo does gets annoying quick. But I still love the original sound.
B007704HO6|5.0|If you love cats, you'll LOVE this book.  James has a wonderful way of telling his story. It's an easy read that also has some heart racing moments.  I'm currently reading James and Bob's second book which is just as wonderful.  These books really make you want to meet James and Bob in person.<br /><br />After I read 'Dewey' (a story about another puss), I didn't think there'd be another book that I would love just as much - if not more - than Dewey.  Maybe it's because I'm passionate about animals but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND all these books - especially to animal lovers.<br /><br />God bless ALL animals and the people who are passionate about them! xo xo xo xo xo xo
B00DW36G32|3.0|Watching Robert Dinero, do hand to hand combat at the age of 70 is laughable...But if you have nothing better to do..and need to kill time this movie will do the trick. The story is good...but a little bit of a reach, and John Travolta has come a long way from Saturday Night Fever, I love his Serbian Accent lol.
B0030B624E|5.0|A movie for the whole family! If I was forced to only own one movie, this movie has to be considered.
B004X80QNG|1.0|Ok, I downloaded it. Now what? Not user-friendly, and no instructions. Maybe others can figure it out, but for me the amount I've time I've already wasted makes this useless. I've added tasks but can't find them. I'm frustrated by this app.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|a real tribute to Robert Johnson and I loved it! The story held me till the last credits scrolled by and I've watched it several times and will again, trying to get a few licks in.,I play a little and slide is my style. Thanks
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I play this game all the time. Very challenging. I end up playing all day long . I love being able to play against my other friends on Facebook.
B0091W7MP4|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time, one that I can watch again and again. It is quite violent, however and may not be for everybody. Sigourney Weaver is excellent, as always, playing an agoraphobic (afraid to leave her apartment for reasons you can only know by watching this thriller). The plot is filled with twists and turns. One never knows what to expect next. For anyone who loves thrillers, especially psychological ones, this film will not disappoint!
B003VANOFY|1.0|I purchased this headset because I believed the positive reviews, they lied.  The headset cuts out continually so no matter what you are listening to you can't follow it because you can't hear anything.  Forget trying to have a conversation via Skype, forget trying to listen to a radio broadcast, forget trying to listen to your music in fact forget doing anything that involves hearing a coherent and continuous audio stream.  JUST FORGET BUYING THIS HEADSET and use your money to buy something worthwhile.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I've already recommended this book to all my friends! It's smart, funny, and oh-so sexy. I laughed out loud numerous times but there was still a lot of depth to the characters, our hero especially, so that I couldn't stop rooting for his happy ending. A witty, modern romance. I can't wait to read it again!
B005MHI0QM|5.0|This version is the complete diary.  I can understand why her father removed some portions of the diary, but this<br />is a true account of a girl of her age.  I'm glad this one was offered.
B00DU73T08|5.0|It was good. cheesy at some parts but overall I liked it. if you enjoy teen fiction romance novels then this movie is for you.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I purchaced this when it was free but it is worth the normal purchase price. It is a combination of story and game. I Great fun!
B000062V9C|1.0|I ordered  two DVD one for grandson and one for my small business. I did'nt  realize or had no knowledge of the regional DVD.  So my movie did'nt play in or my grandson DVD player.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|This music still holds up after all these years.  I still enjoy it now as I did &#34;way back when&#34;.
B0090SI44M|5.0|One of my favorite pixar movie. It has a great story line and loveable characters making this a instant classic.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It was what I needed to share my first kindle with.  I downloaded the Bible on my first kindle, but I didn't charge it for a while and when I did the Bible was gone. Will I need to download it again?
B000HEWEE4|4.0|Couldn't understand @ first, I had to watch a second time to really like & appreciate  the movie! Good acting.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|best album ever!!!! love it!! I am a huge fan of his and this is by far his best work
B00EDF43MY|5.0|I had difficulty figuring out how to use this application I must admit.  However I finally made some progress.  The application is a bit above the ability of my grand daughter and I do not know if I have fully accessed all its functions.  I know she will enjoy it in a few years
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This tv program is a riveting prequel to the popular Thomas Harris series and is a keen insight into the profound mind of the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter.
B0045INOCO|3.0|Apocalypse Now is a post-Vietnam era classic about the US war efforts there, but in the wildest and weirdest sort of way.  The action is over the top, the characters are colorful, and the plot line just bizarre enough.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|Bridgertons and family and gleeful witty quotes and fun fun fun there are all very well linked. A great read
B006S08RLU|4.0|This French Classic features Audrey Tautou in a comedy/romantic comedy that follows a quirky young woman's life around her Paris neighborhood, and her cat and mouse relationship with a new love interest.
B004X80QNG|5.0|honestly I just made this review because I feel bad for the app people. it can't sync with Google on Kindle Fire because of the way Kindle Fire is made. not because of the app. although I'd be livid if I'd spent ten dollars on it...but it's the FAOTD (Free App Of The Day) so who cares?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I want to see more of it!  I enjoyed watching this series,  Hope there is another season!  There you go!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I Loved it so much ive read the series twice!!!!!!! Cant wait for the movie to come out in theater
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I thought leonardo dicaprio was a cute puppy and an ugly dog but he really won me over in his dapper suits. I remembered why I hate Baz Lurman with his need to over edit and over produce everything and the eurotrash approach to grossly appropriate African American culture into his work. So, the movie beautiful to look at and I wish I could buy my husband all of his clothes but it was down right annoying to watch.
B009RH973I|4.0|Cheap price, works great, looks good. Does what it is supposed to do .would recommend to friends and family. Good value.
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|The best case cooler i had, it's quiet you even notice that he is there. I could reduce a lot the noise of my desktop.<br />i recommend it. Also buy a Corsair H80i Water cooler and replace fans to Noctua F12 or P12.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|As a educator it's fabulous to see the dedication by the parent (mom).<br />Collectively we may not agree with all the aspects however the results are outstanding. The support of the parents and grandparents are essential.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This movie came in perfect condition and at a good price.<br />If you love action movies, here's the best of the 21st century,<br />arguably
B000GWE44U|4.0|Watched with my teenage kids. They did not think it was that scarey but changed their mind in the last parts<br />Nothing like classic Jack - &#34;here's johnny&#34; is the best
B0009A40ES|5.0|Good movie. Good price. Done.<br />Came in good condition and works fine.<br />Interesting, and strange film starring Christian Bale,<br />worth a watch
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|It seems like Hollywood was running out of ideas, but this movie is fresh and entertaining.  I enjoyed being able to watch it with my family and not worrying about the dialogue and sexual content.
1419703692|3.0|You get pretty much the same thing, in a smaller booklet type thing if you but the dvd trilogy or blueray trilogy case set.<br />[[ASIN:B009JBWOU0 Knight Trilogy Batman Begins Rises]] is around the same price as this book itself.<br /><br />You can spend around the same money on<br />1. DVD box set of the movies and a decent sized booklet<br />  or<br />2. Hardcover version of said booklet
B006GWO5NE|5.0|No problem with this. It is great to have in the case for times that I need more length between my laptop and my Kindle.
B0029QRA1U|3.0|This is my first turntable so it is all kind of new to me. The sound quality when hooked up to my speakers is excellent, but it seems that mine isn't running at 45RPM consistently! The first few records I tried played perfectly, but the 4th LP (a 2013 one, by chance) began to run a tad slowly. This seems to have continued, it must be playing at 44 or 43 RPM instead! I'm not sure how to fix this, hopefully I will be able to but it is a bit disappointing!
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I liked it but did not love it. I enjoy reading action books but this ending was off to me. I'm reading the second one regardless.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This is a little different this season, with the group having to deal with actual thinking &#34;bad guys&#34;. Makes the plot more interesting and who thinks up this stuff??? 2 slaves without jaws and arms as a defense tactic. Twisted!
B00947N6UG|5.0|Very entertaining. Grand daughter loves it. Interesting how Jack became a Guardian. I've never seen or heard about Guardians before watching this very good movie.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|I have viewed this show several times.  I like it for the graphics and the battle scenes especially in Blu-ray.  I thought it was very entertaining.
1595828095|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Wrightson. I cut my pointy little teeth on his 70's work for Warren. This book is handsomely bound, very nice quality, and just chock full of his incredible work. If you create comics and want to learn from example about how to make an impact with ink, I'd recommend starting here. If you just enjoy reading some excellent tales of horror with illustrations that really draw you into the darkness, you'll love this. It would make a great gift for a fan of horror!
0425263924|2.0|Never having read any of the other books in the \\"Crossfire\\" series, I didn't feel as though I missed much by starting with `Entwined with You'. Gideon Cross is willing to die for Eva and obviously willing to kill for her, but Eva's heart is broken after their very public and humiliating break-up. What Eva doesn't know is Gideon still loves her very much and wants to be with her forever, so when he explains everything they have to figure out a way to carry on their relationship in secret. This is only until the police investigation is complete into the murder of Eva's abuser. Enter Eva's ex, Brett, who Eva's still attracted to - which happens, obviously there was something there for her to be with him the first place. The plot development was pretty slow with lots and lots of uber-steamy sex to fill the pages. I wasn't a big fan of Eva's as she seemed pretty wishy-washy and easily influenced. I think Gideon needs a truly strong woman and I'm not sure Eva's the one. Regardless, they are the ones who want to be together forever and (almost) everyone is happy for them. Out of everyone, my favorite character was Cary, Eva's roommate and best friend, but there were some very strange plot twists with his story which didn't make sense in line with who he was in my opinion. The last part of the book seemed to be a set up for the next book, which was confusing at first because it had been my understanding this was a trilogy, but now there are supposed to be five books total in the series. I'm not so sure die-hard fans of this series will be happy with the ending...<br /><br />Crossfire series: Bared to You (1), Reflected in You (2), Entwined with You (3)
B00DU74U74|3.0|Not a bad flick.  Once is enough.  The main issue is that every scene is significant.  It was constantly serious, with no lifts or lulls.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Received my LifeProof case very promptly and I love it. I followed the instructions on line and did the water test. Absolutely no water got in the case. I did have to take the case off after putting it on the first time due to dust, but the second time was a charm. My daughter got one in a Verizon store and they put it on. Her front is all bubbled and she has to go back to store. My looks perfect. I am very pleased and would recommend this case. I wouldn't have spent $75 for one but this one at $29 was a bargain!!
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this show! Watching it on Amazon just as good as watching it on Netflix or the tv!  :)
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|The plot was OK and kept you interested. The special effects were fantastic. Karl Urban taking over as Dredd was fine but he was a bit stiff; however, that seems to be the way the character is. I enjoyed the movie. Streaming wise - Amazon rocks!! It looked and sounded great.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|...only &#34;Tennis In The Face&#34; is way more fun! This physics-based, shooting game features a funny story line that's carried throughout the game which adds a bit of humor to the destruction. The premise sounds silly, but when a washed-up tennis pro aims to save the city from an evil &#34;energy drink&#34; manufacturer's empire by skillfully lobbing tennis balls to smash the enemy, it can be pretty entertaining! The controls are simple, enabling precision shots that must bypass obstacles by bouncing off walls and creating explosive chain reactions.There are no stress inducing timers, or in-app purchases required to progress in the game, ads are minimal and unobtrusive. Your success is rewarded with a simple crown and the satisfaction that comes from expertly destroying your target. &#34;Tennis In The Face&#34; is a highly addictive, 'can't put it down' game that's just plain fun to play! I love this game and highly recommend it!
B008XG1X18|2.0|I really liked the app but it must not turn off when you back out of it.  It kept using data after I was no longer using it.  I had to delete it until I could make sure I was connected to wifi only when using it.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|An interesting insight to the early days of the Vietnam war. It's incredible reading the author's account of the war especially as a brand new pilot. Then becoming a heroic army aviator who saved many lives.
B008IGAJJK|5.0|We have loved this movie since we first saw it in the theater back in the 70's.  The acting is great and the dialog is fun every time we hear it.  It takes us back to the days we were first dating when my now husband was home on leave from the Navy.  Maybe that is one of the reasons we love the movie!
B004FN1T3A|3.0|This book has some good information on how to relax. I just hope I remember it when the time comes.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|TeamViewer is great! I have it installed on most computers in my house. It has many great purposes too, for instance, if I'm away and my friends, family members need me to install/set up/fix something on their computer (and that usually happens very often), I just connect through TeamViewer as long as I have wi-fi and do it just as I'm doing it on my computer. It's also very convenient, I have a list of computers on my account that I can just connect to with one-click as long as they're on my network. Very powerful tool for presentations as well. I have a kindle fire and a lot of times to show something to someone I need a computer which is not always convenient since I'm away a lot and I don't carry my PC everywhere I go. I just connect and bring up anything from my PC I want. Another cool way I use it is I've set up a webcam on my computer (mostly for Skype) and a program for previewing video, but if I need to see what's going on in my room I can just connect to my PC from my kindle, turn on the program and my webcam automatically becomes a surveillance system. All in all, awesome tool!
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Not exactly what I thought it would be.  The magic was there but I didn't much care for the ending.  I'm a glass is half full kinda girl as opposed to the glass is half empty.<br /><br />(I deliberately described the ending in code so as not to give it away.)

B007AL48UK|5.0|This game is easy on the eyes.  The graphics are larger, it seems, and more colorful which makes identifying them SO much easier and quicker.  Glad I found it because it replaced my old game.  Enjoy!

B005544TRQ|5.0|This story does an exceptional job of portraying the life of the associate in a large law firm. If you can get past the unlikely premise - that a firm would hire an associate without a law degree - then the rest is fun and entertaining. I could go on for hours but then there would be no reason tho watch. Enjoy!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Entertaining...not an epic but worth watching.  Probably more of a three and a half stars. However I did enjoy the movie.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|It's great watching a show that's more about acting then the special effects, and he made the Swiss Army knife famous
B000AP04MO|5.0|I could watch this film OVER and OVER again. The storyline is a little complex but I love it a little more every time it shows. The movie shows the beautiful complexities of love. My favorite film of Audrey's!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app hasn't gone down or stopped working like many apps do, including alarm clock apps. I can't afford this type of app to stop working or go down arbitrarily at any time, without an advance notice, because I'll miss some pretty important appointments in my world, which literally put food on the table.<br /><br />The ability to set multiple alarms, custom alarms along with your normal repeatable daily/weekly alarms is a wonderful feature.  You don't have to be a computer wizard to figure out how to use this application either.

B00C49H3WI|5.0|First, contrary to popular belief, the series is not produced by the BBC in Europe. The show originated in Canada and is currently produced by Temple Street Studios of Toronto. BBC is just the distributor of the series. Second, fantastic series! Can't wait for the 2nd season next April. Send in the clones!
B009CGQOI0|5.0|I don't often buy videos to watch on my Kindle Fire HD, but after reading a book<br />&#34;Scarface: The Ultimate Guide&#34; by Damian Stevenson, I had to see the movie.  Though the movie was made in 1983, the video is HD quality which I thoroughly enjoyed.  There's no better way to watch videos than on my Kindle Fire HD.  Quality is tops!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The recent update to this app is purely hideous. It is not intuitive to use and the screen is too busy. It is difficult to even see the screen well enough to navigate.

B004GJIL34|5.0|Stephen McQueen's direction of an obviously &#34;personal&#34; story.  The almost documentary approach to a well documented time in contemporary history during which a small group of men and women changed national and international policy.  The cost to the jailers/police in addition to the prisoners which was not reported at the time.  Difficult at times.  Extremely violent emotionally more than physically and the minutiae  of defiance within the prison walls.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I was excited for Pacific Rim, but wasn't expecting it to blow me away.  This summer brought a lot of great movies, but Pac Rim was the movie that I actually had FUN watching!  Star Trek was my clear cut winner, but Pac Rim hands down was the most out of the norm movie and I loved it for that.  It's exactly what was promised, Jaegers, Kaiju, punching, biting, Rocket arms.  If you have no interest in these things, go watch a chick flick.  If you are into these things, you're going to love this film!
B00E97AZZK|5.0|I heard this was an OK movie, but when I saw it, I fell in love. Its original script is full of twists that are pulled off by an amazing cast.

B008JFUQ16|5.0|I'm not ashamed to say that `Despicable Me' was one of my favorite movies of 2010.  Granted, the year itself was not a very great one, with only a handful of truly amazing films being made (`The Social Network', `Blue Valentine' and `Toy Story 3' being the best of them), but even still, `Despicable Me' is a respectable and entertaining film that made something unique, charming and completely original out of a genre that has had its fair share of redundancies.  While it seemed to be all over the place at times, it was truly a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />I was excited for `Despicable Me 2'; really excited.  Like I said, I really liked the first one and so the idea of Gru and his newfound family coming back for another adventure had me anticipating something special.<br /><br />I can't say that `Despicable Me 2' is anything new or fresh when you consider where the plot is going (far more generic and predictable than the first film), but these characters are so joyous that one can't help but fall in love with their whole troop.  The kids are hilarious, especially young Agnes, and the inclusion of Lucy is great, especially since both Wiig and Carell have great comedic chemistry here.<br /><br />The plot follows newly `straight-laced' Gru as he is pulled into the dangerous world of espionage by the Anti-Villain League.  They need Gru to use his master bad-guy skills to help capture a real bad-guy who has stolen a mutation serum.  Gru is hesitant, but his current profession (he's making jams and jellies in his basement laboratory) isn't working out so good for him, so he decides to give it a go.  He's paired up with hyperactive and completely star-struck Lucy (she loved Gru's work as a villain) and together they scope out the mall looking for the bad guy.  Gru has his hunches, but it becomes clear that those hunches are clouded with personal feelings when his eldest daughter Margo falls for the charming young son of the man Gru thinks is the real baddie.<br /><br />The usual lovelorn antics occur with the parent despising the idea of his daughter seeking out a love interest.  Daughter's heart gets broken, father mends the tears, father hides from love, father falls in love, everyone is happy.  It isn't really the story that makes this film work, but the way that it is crafted.  There is just so much to love here.  The dialog is sharp, the character development is heartwarming, the criminal activity is comical and the minions are hysterical (yes, I'm one of those people who laugh at everything they do).<br /><br />This was a great family film, one that was bursting at every seam with something to enjoy.  It's not as good as the film one, but it's make good on the promise and actually delivers a sequel that is on par with what we were originally presented with.<br /><br />I give this an A-, and hope to GOD that it winds up on Oscar's ballot over the likes of `Epic'.  This is honestly the best animated film I've seen this year (yes, better than `Monster's University') and I really would love to see it recognized, especially since the first one was denied despite being better than two of Oscar's nominees that year.usual lovelorn antics occur with the parent despising the idea of his daughter seeking out a love interest.

B008469DGY|5.0|The gameplay is simple and addictive. The controls are easy to learn, but at the same time, it provides a good challenge as you aim for the hole, trying to get as close as possible. You can also add spin in order to correct your aim in mid-air.<br /><br />The graphics are downright gorgeous. I find myself staring at the courses while the camera panned around them before play. :)
0553108034|2.0|Very disappointing for a hardcover book, as this is precisely why it was ordered!! Amazon adjusted the price to offset the damage, but still saddened by the receipt of this item. Usually, more care is taken with such deliveries. The remainder of the books ordered were in good condition, although one was surprisingly small (miniature!!). Great story...love the series!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is awesome. It's got so much storage space for any of my needs, and it's easy to carry around anywhere I go. The bag itself feels very secure when worn, so I don't have to worry about any disasters happening. Perfect for taking on nature hikes (with room for snacks as well as a camera) or carrying around a city.
1613832796|5.0|Love this entire book series!! I've purchased it all in hardcover, although two have been much smaller than anticipated ( miniature!). Be careful of the dimensions when ordering your hardcover editions!! Enjoy them, as they are to be treasured over the years and read again, and again!

B0000669JL|5.0|I recently went to Jamaica for the first time. . .and loved it.  Everywhere I went, (not surprisingly) Bob Marley was being blared over the musical waves.  When I took time to find out what collection of music was being used, EVERY CD was Legend:  The Best of Bob Marley And The Wailers.  I've ordered two (2): one for me and one for my ladyfriend.  This is my inspiration for returning to Jamaica at least 3 more times. . .My favorites:  3 Little Birds, Buffalo Soldier, and I Shot the Sheriff

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am totally captivated with the characters and their stories. It is a great series will written full of hours of watching pleasure.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|I've listened to &#34;The Next Day&#34; a few times and have enjoyed it.  Reviewers have compared its energy to the SCARY MONSTERS release, and while there are some similarities to that compilation I think that The Next Day is more like older Bowie compositions from his early carreer (prior to &#34;Aladdin Sane&#34;).  Both &#34;Alladin Sane&#34; and &#34;Scary Monsters&#34; are better releases in my opinion, but &#34;The Next Day&#34; is very good and was worth the 10 year wait since the last Bowie release.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|I liked it. I also liked the Harry Potter series where I first heard of Nickulas Fermel. He destroyed the stone in the last book.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Awesome. Great beginning to a fantastic story. Lots of action with a nice plot. Graphics a fantastic, it brings you to a different universe for a few hours
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have mahjong on my original kindle, but I like this one much better. Tablets are very colorful and east to see.  Also if tile is blocked in it's dark then when tile next to it is removed it lightens up.  Makes it very easy
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This show has a great ensemble cast dealing with real life issues. I like the fast pace and the balance between work and family issues.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan clearly and persuasively summarizes the view that Jesus was an observant Jew, not particularly interested in the hereafter, but intent on social justice in this world, and on defeating corruption and combating the Roman occupiers: a man of extraordinary energy and focus, whose seditious activities resulted in his crucifixion, a man so revered that his followers built a religion after his death, an outcome that would have shocked Jesus.  Whether or not you share Aslan's viewpoint, his account is well written, plentifully documented, and worthy of consideration.
B0091REZMW|1.0|This game is no fun at all. I deleted it from my Kindle Fire because you can only play a couple of levels before it prompts you to buy the full version. It's not interesting enough to buy the full version. I would not recommend this game.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Action-packed, thrill-a-minute ride with J J Abram's new cast of old favorites.  Surprises abound.  This movie really packs one emotional punch after another--whether jokingly funny or tearfully sad.  It, to me, is better than the first STAR TREK remake.  Not only did I stream the movie, I also bought the Blu Ray combo pack.  One thing to remember though is that these STAR  TREK remakes are taking place in an altered reality separate from the Original Series.  So, if your favorite character does not look nor sound like the original, that's ok.  Just watch it and enjoy the show.
B00EKJWS1Q|1.0|Tried dowloading twice - didn't work so I uninstalled it. With technology today, it shouldn't be hard for Outlook to figure it out.
B00BQI4AU6|1.0|sounds like country and way to slow sorry I ever got this cd could have bought something else with the money
B00947N6D8|1.0|I have done alot of business with Amazon and I will do more. I have gotten one DVD that was all in Spanish. That was my fault. I didn't read everything. I got one movie that I didn't order and when I left message to the seller they sent me the movie I requested and said keep the other movie. But this is the FIRST time I EVER got the DVD box but NO MOVIE DISC INSIDE. Thanks for NOTHING.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|My son read this series and really enjoyed the story plot. When the movie came out he watched it and had to add it to his collection.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was intriguing and engaging! It probably would be to deep of subject matter for young children.
B0038W0OHQ|3.0|The sound from the headset was pretty good but there's a problem with the connection the right ear to the top of the headset it is quite annoying
B00008J2R1|4.0|This is a review for the SACD version. What's the story morning glory has been beat up for a terrible sound and I must admit that it isn't the greatest. The stereo SACD layer sounds the same as the regular redbook cd.  The multi channel layer 5.1 is where this SACD picks up dramatically. While the sound still isn't the greatest it does outperform every other digital version if this release. This SACD suffers from mildly harsh highs and mostly no mid range. It does however have a decent low end. For me it was worth the money since I am a big fan of the music contained and it is the best sounding version of this release. I would recommend this SACD only for the multi channel 5.1 and the die hard Oasis fans.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A thoughtful and different view on the German civilian population's resistance to the Nazi party with an interesting point of view.
0545128285|5.0|Great addition to  a Harry Potter book collection. And person who has the whole series should get this book also.
0061478784|5.0|Normally, I hate being one of those people that read the book after the movie comes out. I am saying I have the excuse I did not know there was this book until way after I had watched the movie.<br /><br />This book is full of magical promise, adventure and good lessons. I fell in love with it. I recommended it to everyone who had kids and many who did not. It is a perfect read to share and to experience the beautiful world that is Howl's Moving Castle.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|It leaves you wanting more at the end. Great beginning to a series. I look forward to reading the other books in this series.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As a musician I am on YouTube a lot and the [[ASIN:B00882OHL0 D-Link MovieNite Streaming Media Player]] I purchased for that was not as reliable nor as versatile as I had hoped. This device, though was practically made for connecting YouTube to my TV and controlling it with my Samsung Galaxy Note II or my wheezing old Windows XP laptop.<br /><br />Yes, this will do more than YouTube, but I also have a Roku and that does the Amazon Prime movies I want. This is my YouTube box and it works perfectly.  Installation entailed first plugging this into one of the two HDMI ports on my TV and attaching power. Since my TV has an USB port I use it for power, but the device comes with a wall wart for a USB cable too. The next step required downloading the Chromecast and YouTube apps for my Note II and connecting to my network. Now when I bring up YouTube there is a 'Cast' icon I can press to watch whichever videos or clips I bring up in a search or from my favorites.<br /><br />The app I loaded also will detect and work on my friend's Chromecast when I am at her house, so in a way this is a universal remote. She is using an iPhone 4S and went through basically the same install process, although she is also using NetFlix with hers. Like me she has a Roku plugged into her second HDMI port. She uses that device more than I do, but out needs are different.<br /><br />Overall, I can heartily recommend this for folks who spend a lot of time on YouTube, even if they have another streaming box like the Roku. I am not so sure that I would get this as a general purpose streaming device - at least at this point - if I wanted movies from other sources. In that category the Roku seems to have many more options (at this point in time) and is a more mature and versatile platform. However, for YouTube this is THE solution in my opinion.

B004SIP7F8|5.0|In this wrenchingly sad but enthralling love story, Ralph Fiennes moves seamlessly into a romantic leading role, projecting fragility and subtlety, where in Schindler's List he gave us a nonchalantly evil menace. Based on Michael Ondaatje's novel, which in turn is loosely based on a real person, it concerns a mysterious and badly wounded patient (Fiennes, in heavy prosthetic makeup) who is comforted by a beautiful nurse in Italy near the end of World War II. The patient's story unfolds in flashback, beginning a few years earlier, when he is a mapmaker on a survey of Africa. There, he falls in love with a woman (Kristin Scott Thomas) who is the wife of a colleague (Colin Firth), and their affair precipitates tragic consequences for both. There is a parallel affair between the nurse (Juliet Binoche) and a dashing Indian who defuses bombs (Naveen Andrews). Often cited as a fine screen romance, the movie runs deeper than that. It's a compelling tale of humans attempting to cling to their humanity while swept into the maelstrom of war. It also boasts Gabriel Yared's lovely score and John Seale's fine cinematography of desert locales, which sometimes approaches the sweep of the great Freddie Young's in Lawrence of Arabia.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Original.  Fox management made a huge mistake when they terminated this series.  This could have been a &#34;Cash Cow&#34; for the network.<br /><br />I love this series.  It is substantive and not idiotic.
B002GTZSZU|4.0|This is not a documentary, so don't look for accuracy about the life of one of the greatest classical composers. Milos Forman's version of Peter Shaffer's play (Shaffer also wrote the screenplay) was roundly panned by sticklers for veering widely away from the real lives of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. Yes, their story is stretched and warped nearly beyond recognition, but that doesn't detract from the movie's dazzling performances of Mozart's best works and its fascinating riff on the natures of genius and mediocrity. An aging Salieri - excellently played by F. Murray Abraham in an Oscar-winning role - receives a mercy visit by a reluctant priest at an asylum, after he unsuccessfully attempts suicide. In telling the priest his story, Salieri becomes the movie's narrator as well as its soul and wit, while Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, remains something of an enigma. The locations (the story is set in Vienna but was shot in Czechoslovakia - before it split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia), costumes, and other period evocations are flawless, and the music is rapturous, in particular the performance of Mozart's \\"Requiem\\" at the finale. The versatile Jeffrey Jones - best known as Ed Rooney, the sourpuss of a high school principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off - gives the performance of his career as Emperor Joseph II. Watch also for Cynthia Nixon - Miranda in the cable TV series Sex in the City - in a minor role. [[ASIN:B00HU8VK4K Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)]]
1439102449|3.0|I have enjoyed all of Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan series, and my husband and I listened to the audiobook of Bones are Forever on a long car trip. The first part of this book is so boring that my husband wanted to move on to something else before we were even halfway through.  Although it picks up in the second half, the 15th novel in Reichs' series seems uneven and predictable.  The audio-version is read by Linda Emond, who we did enjoy.<br /><br />Dr. Temperance Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who splits her time between Montreal and Charlotte, NC.  In Bones are Forever, Brennan is called to a scene when three dead infants are discovered in an apartment.  Two of them have been there for some time, and thus, Brennan's services are required.  Homicide detective and Brenna's former boyfriend, Andrew Ryan, is lead on the case.  Canadian Mounty Oliver Hasty is also involved when the case moves to Edmonton, and then Yellowknife.  The first part of this novels takes place in Montreal, and that section is especially slow.  I know that Reichs likes to talk about her job, but the technical aspects were just too many and too boring.  But once the team moves to Yellowknife, the action picks up as they deal with a variety of issues including drug dealing, diamond mining, environmentalists, and even murders.  It takes a while for Brennan to piece the clues together to form a complete picture, and as usual, her life is in danger as a result.<br /><br />I enjoy books in which I learn something, and Kathy Reichs' books never disappoint on that score.  Although I have already learned quite a bit about forensic anthroplogy, I enjoyed reading about the diamond mining that is going on in Canada.<br /><br />I think that maybe it's time for Reichs to get out of her rut and start writing books that don't use the same cookie-cutter plot outline.  While Bones are Forever was ultimately a decent book, it's not one of Reichs' best efforts.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|Steven Spielberg finally won Best Picture and Best Director Oscars, after 19 years of trying, with this powerful portrait of one of the most heroic figures of the Holocaust. Based on the historical novel by Thomas Keneally, it's the story of Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who protected and eventually saved hundreds of Jews from the death camps by insisting they were essential for his factory and by bribing Nazi officials into complicity. Shot in black and white except for one symbolic scene, the movie contains moments of extreme emotional intensity. Spielberg's technical crew advanced the ability to portray murder and execution on the screen with horrifying results, and Ralph Fiennes (pronounced RAFE FINE) made his movie debut as the sadistic concentration camp commandant. It is a vivid, grim portrait of humanity at its worst, yet with a quietly shattering but triumphant resolution. The John Williams score, with a violin solo by virtuoso Itzhak Perlman, is possibly the most exquisitely sad bit of movie music ever written.

The director, Sir Richard Attenborough, spares no effort to bring to the screen the story of the man who, more than any other, is responsible for the existence of India as an independent nation and a democracy. The story begins with Gandhi's death at the hands of an assassin in 1948 - the result of his lifetime effort to bring about reconciliation between India's Muslims and Hindus. That's not a political statement; it's a reflection of the fates of most of history's great peacemakers. It is an enduring human tragedy and mystery that so many great healers have met violent ends, while some of humanity's worst villains have died peacefully. After the initial assassination, the story flashes back to the beginning of Gandhi's adult life, which took place in South Africa. This is a truly massive production. The funeral scene alone, none of which was computer-generated, features more extras than have ever been shown on the screen: an estimated 400,000 people. Shot entirely in India, it presents a land that seems so alien to westerners that it might as well be taking place on another planet. For the title role, Attenborough - perhaps following the lead of the great David Lean, who often cast British actors to play foreigners - chose to debut Ben Kingsley, who portrayed Gandhi so well that he earned several top acting honors including the Oscar. It's a tribute to him that despite the movie's scale, Kingsley always commands its center. As I said, it's an earnest movie and a most thoughtful portrayal - although it is a fictionalized biography, not a documentary, which conveniently ignores some of Gandhi's stranger behaviors. You might not love Gandhi, but you won't be sorry you saw it. [[ASIN:B00HU8VK4K Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)]]
B000PMG16U|3.0|I remember how unexpected the release of the new Star Wars films was almost ten years ago. Looking back I can admit that only Revenge of the Sith really did the Star Wars universe any justice. Phantom Menace was annoying and Attack of the Clones was fairly bland. Jar Jar Binks was about as cool as Howard the Duck. When we see the characters in the new trilogy there is an even greater focus on toys. It seems none of the actors provided the depth and memorability of Ford, Fisher and Hamill did. Star Wars VII linking all the films together would be fantastic if it receives a solid script.<br /><br />Comparing this 3-disc Blu-ray trilogy to the 9-disc [[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]]] you may notice this release contains only audio commentaries (but Complete Saga is packed with extras). The Star Wars Prequel Trilogy (Widescreen Edition) on DVD had much more bonus supplements than this Blu-ray set. This isn't the deluxe release of these films so if you want more extras then check out the other Star Wars box sets on Blu-ray or DVD. The Prequel Trilogy has managed to retain its value.
B00BB8Q13A|5.0|The surprise crowd-pleaser of 1998 upset Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan in the Oscar race, largely because of an unprecedented publicity campaign orchestrated by Miramax Pictures, the producer and distributor. Ryan is the better movie, but there's no denying this one's appeal. It's the fanciful (meaning entirely fictional) story of Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes - Ralph's younger brother) as the famous playwright struggling both financially and artistically early in his career. He's writing a play called \\"Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,\\" which even he knows is going nowhere. Then he meets the love of his life, Lady Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his inspiration suddenly changes. The plot is far too clever to give away, except to say that its telling of the tale of the writing of Romeo and Juliet, one of the greatest plays in the English language, is so good it doesn't really matter whether it's fictional or not - you'll want to believe it is true. With terrific performances by Fiennes, whose face is wonderfully expressive, Paltrow as \\"Juliet\\" in various guises - the best work of her career - and strong support from Colin Firth (playing well against type) as Shakespeare's romantic rival, Geoffrey Rush as a theatre owner, and the incomparable Judi Dench in an Oscar-winning turn as Queen Elizabeth I. Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard wrote the excellent screenplay, and the lush, memorable score is by British composer Stephen Warbeck.

B00BLRXDTQ|2.0|You get 3 Mad Max films in this 3-disc set. Overall, the picture and audio quality are very good. The amount of audio and language options is insane. The real problem is that the special features on this release are light. There is only 30 minutes total for all 3 films, 2 audio commentaries and nothing except the trailer for the third film (the 52-minute 'Making of Beyond Thunderdome' and other previous extras aren't included). This franchise deserves much more in the way of bonus content (such as a 3-hour retrospective documentary) in a future release. Fans who own Mad Max and Road Warrior on Blu-ray may not want to upgrade because of the light treatment this set receives. I give the films 4 stars but this set gets 2 stars. Mad Max: Fury Road is not included.<br /><br />* Region 2 purchasers should know this US Blu-Ray set is partially region locked (only the sequels are region-free not the original).<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo, German Dolby Digital 5.1, Hungarian Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono, Italian Dolby Digital 5.1, Italian Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo, Polish Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono, Portuguese Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono, Russian Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish (Castilian) Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish (Latin American) Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo, Czech Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono<br />Subtitles/Captions: English (SDH), French, Hebrew, Portuguese, Romanian, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Thai, Turkish, Arabic, Serbian, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Chinese, German, Greek, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, Finnish<br />Special Features: Audio Commentaries, Featurettes, Trailers, Collectible Tin Box
B004X4R49Y|5.0|An English movie but well deserving of Hollywood's highest honor, the title refers to a critical moment in that country's history. In the fall of 1939, negotiations between Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Adolph Hitler had broken down, and the country found itself at war with Nazi Germany. The people were frightened, and the government was in turmoil. What could be done to bolster the nation for what was coming? The answer: The new king, George VI, needed to rally the citizens of the British Empire with a rousing speech. Except that the king had a problem - a big one: He stuttered, terribly. Actually that's the movie's climax, not its beginning, and what occurs before it represents one of the most unusual friendships ever presented on the screen. George, magnificently portrayed by Colin Firth, seeks out the services of Lionel Logue, a London speech therapist of questionable credentials played with great relish by Geoffrey Rush. Together and painstakingly, Lionel helps Bertie - the king's pet name - to overcome his problem. That's it, but therein lies greatness. The movie is graced with a host of indelible performances, including Michael Gambon as Bertie's father, King George V; Claire Bloom as Queen Mary, his mother; Helena Bonham Carter as his wife, the Duchess of York; Guy Pearce as Edward, his playboy brother, who abdicates his throne to marry his lover from Baltimore, and Jennifer Ehle as Lionel's bemused wife. But the heart of the movie is the priceless interplay between Firth, who deservedly won an Oscar, and Rush, who undeservedly did not. Tom Hooper's direction and David Seidler's script, Oscar-winners both, are flawless, and Danny Cohen's muted cinematography fits the mood perfectly. My only, slight, complaint is that Timothy Spall, as Winston Churchill, plays the prime minister as a caricature. Otherwise a fine, fine movie!

B003KGBIRK|4.0|David Cronenberg directed this bizarre masterpiece about a man who is losing his grip on reality after watching a snuff film over a pirate broadcast. James Woods stars as the television station owner who is losing his grip on reality. The film is very unique because it shows you almost exclusively what Woods himself sees and experiences. The result is somewhat trippy because we don't know if what we are seeing is real or hallucination. As a huge Cronenberg fan I was not disappointed by the special effects, story, action and overall insanity of this film. While a few ideas are dated (especially the size of the televisions shown and betamax tapes) this is one of the more original films you will ever see. There is over 90 minutes of bonus content (plus two audio commentaries). The picture and audio quality are very good. My only complaint is that there is no feature-length documentary or deleted scenes. The longest featurette is 28 minutes.<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray. I would rate the film 5 stars and this Blu-ray gets 4 stars (more supplements should be added). The Blu-ray has held its value.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Errol Flynn's performance in the title role has thrilled audiences young and old for decades. His uninvited appearance at a dinner at Nottingham Castle honoring Prince John (Claude Rains) alone stands as one of the great entrance scenes of all time. As the outlaw Robin of Loxley, Flynn is brash, brave and loaded with charm, and despite his rather dainty costumes, he's a man's man. Because of these qualities, I think The Adventures of Robin Hood belongs among the movie classics for children -- particularly growing boys -- because it conveys important themes for them within the context of a fictional story. Yes, there was a King Richard the Lionhearted, and there was a Prince John, but there was no Robin Hood, and the lives of the real Richard and John turned out quite differently than portrayed here. This is no history - it's wish fulfillment, produced with all of the skills Hollywood's movie factory (in this case the Warner Brothers studio) possessed. It's the way you'd like things to turn out, which is why the story packs so much emotional punch when Richard finally returns to England. It's also a fine morality tale for children. There's heroism, humor, honor, courage and loyalty. There's also cruelty, deceit, cowardice, and treachery. It all shows without subtlety how good and evil people contend in this world. Set in England in the 10th century, the movie was shot entirely in California in glorious Technicolor, with a rousing score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Its look and energy remain undimmed, and Flynn's Robin Hood is the best ever. With his onscreen regulars Olivia de Havilland as Lady Marian, Basil Rathbone as Sir Guy of Gisbourne, and Alan Hale as Little John.

B000FVQLQQ|4.0|Little Ronnie Howard, who began his career in movies in the late 1950s (see The Music Man elsewhere), and who became a TV child star in the early '60s, young adult star in the '70s and fledgling director in the '80s, reaches full maturity here. The story is based on the life of John Nash, a Nobel Prize-winning mathematician who also suffered from raging paranoia. Howard was smart enough to pick the supremely talented Russell Crowe to play Nash in an Oscar-winning performance, and Crowe - as he had done several times previously - utterly becomes his character. Jennifer Connelly also won for Best Actress as Nash's long-suffering wife. Sometimes heartbreaking and maybe a little too sentimental at the climax, this is a compelling examination of the tension between genius and insanity that often inhabits great minds. Fine supporting performances by Christopher Plummer as a psychiatrist and Ed Harris as a mysterious \\"government\\" figure.

B002XZNHG4|4.0|Woody Allen directed this classic romantic comedy, but the great Ralph Rosenbloom turned it into an Oscar winner. In his fascinating book on film editing, \\"When the Shooting Stops ... the Cutting Begins,\\" Rosenbloom explained how Annie Hall started out as a collection of loosely related scenes that was more a personal psychological exploration by Allen than a love story. Only after months of re-edits and some re-shooting did the story emerge as movie audiences saw it. Annie Hall is a flight of fancy, loosely based on the real-life affair between Allen and Keaton (Hall is Keaton's real name). Sometimes sweet and affectionate, sometimes acidly satirical, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, it was chosen Best Picture in a year that included such crowd-pleasing blockbusters as Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It is beginning to seem a little dated after more than three decades, but it remains one of the sharpest American comedies on the screen. Keaton, who won the Best Actress Oscar, is marvelously appealing. Watch for bit parts by Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Walken.

B0048EANOW|5.0|Acting is superior, loved the story.  The locales in L.A. are famous and the story has a lot of factual information from that time period.  You will recognize several actors doing great work early in their careers before they became so famous.  This movie made some of them into the stars they are today.  If you like suspense, mystery, some action and a little romance with a good story ending, this movie is for you!
B000I3PERS|5.0|Twice in his career, Mel Gibson (born in the U.S.A. and raised in Australia) has shown he is not only a solid actor but also an exceptional director. This was the first time. As Kevin Costner had done with Dances with Wolves five years earlier, Gibson directed himself in a movie that transcends its star-vehicle genre and becomes an emotionally powerful story extremely well told. Gibson plays William Wallace, a Scotsman who led a rebellion against King Edward I of England in the 14th century and, for a time, held the promise of Scottish independence. As with all Hollywood period epics, this one takes large liberties with history - and Wallace is a most elusive historical figure. But Gibson in the role is tremendously appealing and heroic, and you cannot help but feel for him and grieve with him. With splendid cinematography of the mostly Irish, and some Scottish, locations by John Toll, and a haunting, lyrical score by James Horner. The memorable cast includes Brendan Gleeson and David O'Hara as Wallace's trusted lieutenants, veteran TV actor Patrick McGoohan in a gleefully villainous turn as England's King Edward the Longshanks, Ian Bannen as the leprosy-ridden Scottish Lord Robert the Bruce, beautiful Catherine McCormack as Wallace's wife Murron, and gorgeous Sophie Marceau as the daughter-in-law of Longshanks and Wallace's would-be savior. There's also a terrific performance by Angus Macfadyen as the brooding Robert the Bruce the younger, which at times eclipses even Gibson's. Again, don't take this as history. Instead, enjoy it as wishful thinking and exceptional epic moviemaking. [[ASIN:B00HU8VK4K Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)]]
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This is my first foray into the Harlequin KISS line.  I think I saw this book when it first came out, but I didn't buy it right away.  I wasn't sure what to expect with this new line of books, but the premise of this one sounded like fun.  In fact, I just read another book that starts out similarly - couple meets in Vegas, gets married and then has to deal with the fall out.  The cover of this one looked like a nice romantic comedy-type, so why not.  But I just couldn't get into it.  It felt slow and heavy, like a bad muffin.  You keep hoping it turns around, but it just kept dragging.<br /><br />First up is our heroine, Megan.  She's got some guy problems.  Seemingly guys just don't stay around with her.  She's really nice, looks like a on-track sort of person, but decides that she just doesn't want to deal with the whole romance thing anymore.  She just wants to have a baby.  I can applaud her for her straightforwardness and her internal decision-making process.  She's figured out what she wants and she's going for it.<br /><br />But as we move through the book, we see that she actually has a lot of daddy issues, boundary issues and she really can't enjoy the beginning stage of a relationship because she's so scared that the guy is going to leave her.  With her underlying issues, I'm surprised she was able to have a couple relationships before this one and that she was able to get to the point where the guy left her.  It felt to me like she doesn't let herself have that honeymoon period in a relationship.  She wants all or nothing - 25 years married couple or single matron.  She just can't handle the in between.  I could understand the fearful place that was coming from, but she sure takes it to the extreme.  If that were the only thing, she'd still seem pretty likable, but then she's got the boundary issues.<br /><br />Megan's only interaction with anyone not related to her new husband is her cousin and the cousin's two other bridesmaids.  (The cousin's wedding is the reason they started out in Vegas.) This trio is a pile of work.  They're just nasty to Megan.  I didn't mind it too much at the beginning of the book because they were there for the wedding.  Megan says she doesn't know them well but keeps the peace for the sake of the wedding.  I can respect that, but then when things are going bad for her, she calls these same women.  And sits meekly while they ridicule her and have their little cliquey, nastiness to each other about Megan while they're talking.  Megan gave me no indication that she had friends or any form of life outside what other people chose to bestow on her.  Whether it was Connor or these non-friends, she thinks she's a steady, decisive person because she was going to choose artificial insemination, but every single part of her life that we see in this book shows her unable to care for herself physically or emotionally.  She gave one small shove of independence late in the book, but that was it.<br /><br />Then we have Connor.  Typical Harlequin billionaire-type.  Used to getting what he wants but he has a troubled past with a broken home growing up.  He seemed very strong, arrogant, and unflappable, but often strayed into the douchy category to me.<br /><br />Connor starts out talking with his friend at a Vegas bar and you can just see him rolling his eyes as his friend asks if he's dating.  He starts narrating to himself that his guy friend loses his man-card because he's talking about feelings.  And these were simple questions like \\"how are you holding up since your almost-fiancee dumped you?\\". Strike one for the douchy-hero.<br /><br />He doesn't want a love relationship because that's just too messy.  But he does want a companion-wife with benefits.  He gives a lot of mixed signals with stuff like wanting Megan to \\"fall for him\\" (his words), but really, this is just a happy companionship.  He's jealous and possessive of Megan almost from the start, which seems to be Harlequin-speak for \\"I'm falling in love and I don't even know it\\".  I can handle a little bit of jealousy or possessiveness, but it starts straying into \\"ownership\\" in this book.  He's known Megan for one day and when she gets dressed up for her cousin's wedding, he just can't handle that other people will see some of her thighs or the shape of her butt and goes so far as to try to cover her up with his coat as soon as he can.  Strike two for the douchy-hero.<br /><br />They decide to give the marriage a try, so Megan (obviously) moves part-way across the country to live with Connor.  Megan ends up testing Connor with all her worst flaws to see if he can handle who she is.  Connor catches on to what she's doing and doesn't really care one way or the other.  He'll deal with bad food, facial scrub masks, pajama days when Megan's working all day, just as long as she stays with him.  It's meant to be sweet and vulnerable for both of them, but when Connor's internal monologue says he can touch her butt because \\"he needed a reminder as to why he was going to choke down the coming atrocity.  An incentive of sorts.\\", it veers into objectification instead of caring.  Strike three for the douchy-hero.<br /><br />I liked Connor's friend, Jeff.  I almost wish he was the hero instead.  It would have served Connor right to lose Megan to Jeff for being such a douche.  But then again, Megan didn't show a lot of promise or backbone, so I probably wouldn't want to stick Jeff with her anyway.  Jeff showed himself to really care about Connor, even though Connor really gave him no reason.  He kept Connor in line even when Connor was a jerk and the times that Jeff makes an appearance in the book are more lighthearted.<br /><br />The ending was satisfyingly emotional.  Megan grew some backbone related to Connor (but not to her \\"friends\\"), Connor groveled in a nice way, and I was glad to see them together.  But the journey to get there didn't feel worth it.  Neither character seemed to grow personally, even if they did resolve some of their afraid-of-love issues.g in love and I don't even know it\\".

I really think that the story itself had a lot more potential then was was realized here. My husband really enjoyed the cars in the movie for for him that was the highlight! Sad really -- I would think that Gatsby's life story would have deserved better; self made man, tragic love story, rich and poor mingling and falling hopelessly in love ....

I downloaded the Clean Master and cleared out a TON of stuff that was running in the background, and things that were associated with games that she'd already removed.

The series is indeed action-packed, with intrigue, surprises along the way, sad endings and happy endings, but it is not in a physical way. IOt is all about dialogue; all the sessions take place in the therapist's office, expertly and empathically played by Gabriel Byrne. Some sessions take place at his clinical supervisor's office, that part equally well performed by Diane Weest. Paul's clients really test his patience and boundaries. It is good to show that even experienced therapists need to avail themselves of supervision from time to time throughout their career. Being a clinical social worker myself for years, it feels as if the  patients are real people with real life dilemmas. The therapeutic dialogue that takes place seems real and appropriate and surely must have been written in part by actual therapists. The therapist, Paul, does an excellent job with that sometimes difficult technique of staring and waiting for a long time to let the client talk first, the hugely pregnant pause as it were. However, I feel he offers &#34;interpretations&#34; too frequently, too lengthy, and some times off the mark, rather than letting the client take his/her time and eventually come to a meaningful interpretation on their own. I must say this series highlights some extremely difficult, angry, defiant, non-compliant clients, and if my caseload was filled with cases like that, I don't think I would have lasted over 20 years in the business. I can't wait to watch Season 2 and then Season 3.
B00932A3SK|4.0|I had seen this movie before, a delicious art heist by an unusual protagonist, nicely done and well acted. There are enough twists and plot points to keep anyone happy, as long as you don't mind subtitles this is very entertaining
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I think this app is great for the work traveler like me.  This app was a great tool to use when on the go for a quick way to be fit.
B00A0SMTXS|3.0|I got his for free when bought a Sony Blu ray player, and it's not bad. I enjoy Colin Farrell's work, although the character here isn't as interesting as In Bruges, but hey, he got to play off Ralph Fiennes and Brendan Gleason in that one. But I digress. There are some nice little winks to the original (still one of my favorite Schwarezenegger flicks) and the plot move consistently, if a bit slowly at times. I have to say Kate Beckinsale was really good in the expanded role of the wife, oozing an oily malevolence as she attempts to hunt him down. A good weekend movie, nothing too cerebral but fun.
B004X80QNG|1.0|There is a newer version of this app,  however that is being sold separately and you cannot upgrade for free from this version.  Seems very greedy to me.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|I've gotta say Karl Urban managed the Judge Dredd helmet face sneer nicely, probably better than Stallone did years ago, and there's more of a plot here, and some nice nuances (remember the drug that slows down perception.....). Lena Headey is worth the price of admission in any roll, but as a psychopathic gang czar? Yes please. Plus, if you enjoy things blowing up, the blow up good in Dredd. A good weekend movie, don't expect a subtle commentary on the human condition.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|We missed the entire program on TV, so finding this set was great! My husband is a WWII buff, and the quality of this show surpasses a lot of those on the market. He is very happy with it!
B008469DGY|4.0|While I haven't played with all of the game play options yet, the game is rather addicting. There are no club choices, no putting, etc. You can adjust the ball movement after the shot and you try to get close to the hole or in the hole each shot for points as a timer counts down. Get as many points as possible before times runs out. If you make it in the hole or in the first circle around the whole it adds more time to the clock. The gameplay is really simple but quite fun and addicting.
B00006CXSS|5.0|A great collection for those interested in WWII history. Was recommended to us by a veteran, and my history buff husband is very happy with the quality of this set.
B003U53GK8|5.0|this show held me captive scene after scene, episode after episode, season after season from the first frame to the last.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|For the nay sayers out there, you misunderstand how the French do horror. If you've ever lived through a mentally and physically horrific time in life, you'll understand how this movie will play out. Yes, there are some pretty bloody scenes. Without giving away the plot, this movie takes you through some of the craziest horrors I could imagine a human going through. No ghost, LeatherFace, demon or Kruger could top this for me. When the plot twists around and you're left saying...Wait...what just happened? please try to tell me that's not terrifying to think our species can do that to each other.<br /><br />I personally love French \\"horror\\". It explores the human mind more than the sheer need to see blood and guts and gore. If you like a thrill and a thinker in one, definitely get this movie.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Went back and started this show from the beginning at the recommendation of a friend. I'm a huge fan of Breaking Bad and this show is right up there with it.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Bought this book for my grand daughter - she did not stop reading till the book was finished and then told me all about it.  She has the second book now and is eagerly looking forward to more.  Thank you for such great entertainment!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an excellent game. There is the temptation to purchase goodies, but it's more fun to play for them. Lots of fun.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|a great book  kept the reader interested  not so good ending  could have been better thought out  FBI agent dies & we still don't know who is the leader of the bad guys???  poor  ending
B006GWO5NE|4.0|My grandson broke the original cord. I had to purchase a new one. So far this cord has been working fine.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I love this album.  Adele has a wonderful voice and she is a great performer.  I enjoy listening to her sing.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I found myself having lost of time with this addictive game. It is challenging but not so much that you want to throw your smartphone.
B00633W614|4.0|Must read the book written by Archer before this one to make it worthwhile.  He keeps you  well informed on the life and times during hardships of all kinds  and the strengths of good characters in dealing with them..
B00D1X0576|2.0|All that I could get this app to do was to display my ping. I was hoping for the speed of the internet that I use.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I chose this rating because I love all these books! They are so rich in detail and are told from an intriguing viewpoint.....
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A simple yet effective brain teaser. I can usually look at the random pattern of colored dots and connect them in no time. There are a few that require several minutes tracing the path in my head so I can get that &#34;perfect&#34; the first time. A great game to download. It definitely takes your mind of things that are worrying you in your daily life.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Great book about the psychology of habits and how to change them. The portions discussing how to change the habits of groups was particularly enlightening.
B008Y768XO|4.0|This was advertised as a preview in front of my kids' cartoon DVD but I wouldn't say this is really a kids movie.  The loyalty aspect is great, but it's pretty sad.  (My children are 3 and 5.)  As an adult, I liked the movie.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|Norwegian humor tends to be subtle, but this one is hilarious.  Helpful, but not necessary, to have<br />any familiarity with Scandinavian culture.  If you're from Minnesota, you hardly need to read the<br />subtitles even though the dialogue is in Norwegian.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Fun when you can play.  App automatically closes for no reason every now and then. Dont like that you can only play on average twice per hr. If you win you should get tokens to keep playing. If I'm missing something let me know. other then that its fun when you can play.
B0073COMUW|1.0|Should have read the reviews. The price was too good to be true. I've have two Philips bulbs that worked perfectly out of the box.<br /><br />On top of that I thought I had returned the item on Amazon but lost the printed label but Amazon won't let me reprint the label because it's beyond 30 days :(
B000I9VZKW|5.0|I can watch this one over and over. Will Smith, in my opinion, is one of the greatest actors and proves it yet again in this movie. This is a futuristic look into our world to be.
B000002L99|5.0|5150 is the first album from VAN HALEN with Sammy Hagar´s vocals.....Sammy style bring another vibe to VAN HALEN like on pearls like DREAMS, BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, SUMMER NIGHTS and GET UP!!!!!REALLY GREAT!!!! WELL DONE, VAN HALEN!!!!!!!!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|This movie was what I call a &#34;B&#34; movie, was fun to watch the first time but wouldn't buy it or watch it again. More for younger people, not adults.
B000002LEM|5.0|OU812 is a cool heavy ROCK album from the legendary VAN HALEN....It's one of my favourites with ROCK gems like MINE ALL MINE, NATURALLY WIRED, CABO WABO, SOURCE OF INFECTION and SUCKER IN A 3 PIECE!!!!! VAN HALEN RULES!!!!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Funny, cute and awesomely different. If you love animated movies than this is a good one for you. Simply nice.
B000002MUQ|5.0|BALANCE is a great album from VAN HALEN....It´s the last with Sammy Hagar´s vocals, with HEAVY ROCK pearls like THE SEVENTH SEAL, AFTERSHOCK, AMSTERDAM and the huge hit CAN´T STOP LOVING YOU!!!!! The Sammy Hagar ERA is great, and BALANCE is a nice collection from VAN HALEN!!!!!!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|THOUGHT THE SHADY CHARACTER WAS THE BAD GUY, TURNS OUT THERE IS A TWIST, SORRY TO GIVE IT AWAY. KINDA &#34;HUCK-FINNISH&#34; TYPE MOVIE. KEEPS YA INTERESTED, HAS AN ACTION SCENE.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried,I laughed, I got mad all at the same time while reading g this book. I love the way this book could make me smile no matter what was going on. Bravo
B00CL6GAD2|4.0|STAR STUDDED CAST WITH SOME MONEY PUT INTO THE PICTURE, IF YOU HAVEN'T RENTED IT RENT IT. LIKED MOVIE EVEN THOUGH I KNEW THE STORY LINE. MARKY -MARK IS HIS USUAL EAST COAST STYLE ACTION MAN.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Fun characters, pretty good plot. Steve Carell is very good in the movie. Good for kids and adults. Worth renting.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|LEANARDO IS GREAT AS USUAL, GOOD REMAKE OF AN OLD HIT, WITH SOME MODERNIZATIONS, GREAT SCENES. NOT BAD MOVIE FOR A RENTAL.
1439170916|5.0|Highly informative and brilliantly written history and biology of cancer.  He goes into depth on a huge subject and the last section is on the treatments now being used to treat cancer.  The molecular and genetic base of the disease and its molecular treatments are discussed at length and are understandable for the scientifically literate reader.
B005R32L66|4.0|I have a Droid DNA and on the Google Play store it said that Skype was not compatible with my phone and wouldn't let me download the app.  I figured I'd try it from Amazon and see if it said the same thing.  I downloaded it and it has worked fine on my phone!  :)
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I bought this to round off our collection of Men in Black movies.  It was a good movie.  My boys really enjoyed it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It makes you believe that It might be a real story. It's sad and happy and sad and happy again. The fault in our stars reminds you that life is not fair
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Love this movie.  My kids got this for me and I really enjoyed it.  The price was great and I am extremely pleased with the purchase.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Sweet story. Is it real or witchcraft ? I liked it a lot, it was an easy and fun book.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I thought I was getting the &#34;game&#34;  so not too happy.  I had heard a lot about how fun the game was and I didn't read it good enough before I ordered it..my bad.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My son in law is a chef and we had a great time with him and how much of this really goes on in where he works.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Really good story about two teens and there relationship as they go through cancer battles.  I liked how the story told us what people really go through and feel like when they are battling a life-threatening condition at this age.  I liked how the characters were real without having to include bad language.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|Looks like a good program but deleted it because the permissions are too invasive to the point of being ridiculous.<br /><br />No program requires those kinds of permissions unless they have an agenda that is very invasive!
B003L77G6A|5.0|Great show, still going strong and funny, been buying one season at a time and looking forward to ordering the fifth from amazon as well as each season so far arrived in good condition.
B008602KQI|1.0|I have not seen the hunger games yet. when I get the movie I will watch it.<br />until then I will not vote.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You must read WOOL if you are the type to enjoy a pre-apocalyptic to post-apocalyptic tale of the creation of a dystopian society. The characters are well developed and very likeable (...or dis-likeable). The author sure knows how to write in a way that conveys excitement/worry/fear to the reader. I found myself nervous to turn some pages for fear of what was to come next. The Silo concept is a fascinating one, technically and socially, and worth of Hollywood’s attention I think.
B0006J28MI|5.0|i like the way how fast this movie came after i ordered it and its a fave movie of mine
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Liked his other books better.  I could not get around all the deception themes in this novel.  It's well written and the characterizations are good but all the deception and its consequences made it a very dark reading experience for me.
B004TP6O8O|5.0|i like that I can put on this album and listen to it all the way through. just grab some rolling papers and vibe out
B003YL4KS0|5.0|This book gives information to change the life of your hair in such a way it changes you life! Great information and laid out as an easy read.<br />Thank you!!
B000I3UMLQ|4.0|One of the better of the Kirk and crew movies.  Story line is interesting.  Not as cheesy as some of the other films, e.g. &#34;voyage home&#34;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like minecraft. My sisters even like minecraft they are 7 and 4. Can you believe that! Do you like mine craft&iquest;<br /><br />  MINECRAFT ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007Z9QP3K|3.0|Interesting foreign (assumed) account of WWII U-boat experiences.  Acting not always up to par with some American films of the time.  Somewhat slow moving and did have to force myself to continue watching.  Had its moments.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|If you are suicidal DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!  The only redeeming feature was Anne Hathaway's song.  I know, I know, everbody loves it.  Well, I didn't.  Russell Crowe was so miscast it was comical; Hugh Jackman (one of my favorites) was not convincing; Anne Hathaway was fair, and she only excelled when she sang her song.  The whole look of the movie and its depressing story forced me to take a tranquilizer for the first time in over 2 years.  I gave the movie to a local library.  I have a collection of over 700 dvd's that took me over 25 years to collect because my husband and I suspected we were going to be poor in our old age, but this one was not a keeper nor do I ever want to see it again.  A waste of film and some good actors.
B002UWH8P6|3.0|Fairly well done but becomes a little depressing and, of course, sci go themes often copied from earlier classics such as Trek and the earlier Stargates. But that's to be expected. If you like the original stargate its ok but less &#34;hopeful&#34; with unredeeming lead characters with  huge moral defects in every single one. While perhaps more realistic as far as character defects, still not likeable main characters. Aliens only come in2 sizes, warlike or supremely good, again nothing new there but even Trek was better at coloring its various shades of aliens. Not sure whether to recommend or not. Visuals pretty good.<br /><br />After rereading my review and thinking it through, I say 2 stars but I couldn't figure out how to change the stars. The reason for downgrade is the depressing nature of the show. I will NEVER want to see again and morality was extremely poor, albeit more realistic of humanity's ills than some shows. I'd even rate THIS aspect at a negative figure and feel uncomfortable about my prior rating of 3. The 3 was earned by acting and plot only, and even that only in some episodes although only the main characters were ok, ancillary characters seemed wooden.<br /><br />Note: season 2 was better. See review.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This version is formatted somewhat differently,  but it fits the Kindle screen and is not hard to figure out.  Love  having access to FB on  my Kindle
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome I really like it it is awesome I like it I play all the time I will play it for a long time
B00DGQF0K0|3.0|a nicely difficult game, but ..... if you need to put it down for a bit, when you come back you start all over. BOO. Also, some of the codes are sufficiently obscure that you need a lot of just plain  luck ....
B007SYWFRM|4.0|only problem not enough acorns. should be able to swap with coins or get more in game.scratch game is stingey with giving acorns. can't. buy certain animals and items without acorns and not buying acorns with real money.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|So similar to the first season, but whoa at the ending...... just saying! Didn't see that one coming! A must read!
0345803485|3.0|This is not a bad book, the hype has placed it on a level where it's nearly impossible to live up to the publicity machine. It's like the first Hangover movie, by the time you get around to it you think, so that's it. But I must say that while it does start slow, it really amps up after the hardware store encounter. It's worth reading just to say you've read it when you talk to your girlfriends, but there are so many more worthwhile titles.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Good book I recommend it. Please read if you feel lost in life. I read it during a troubled time.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Throughout this whole book I was drawn into the story even more with each line I read. I couldn't put the book down! I kept saying, &#34;I'll only read one more chapter..&#34; I ended up finishing the book quickly, because all I wanted to do was read! We saw new characters in this book and more relationships develop, and started to get little clues and hints at the big picture.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game really like playing it. My grandchildren would love this game, also. I will get my sisters to try this game, too.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Loved Cassie's third book in the series. It was the moment all the fans felt this bliss of happiness. It was amazing to read all these characters come to life and little things finally come to the big picture. I fell more and more in love with everyone and everything about the series.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My son begged and begged for me to buy this game for him. He loved it and it occupied his attention for a week or 2 but now never plays it. If he would have continued to play it then it would most definitely have been worth the price. It's not the games fault but my sons short attention span.
B00006J3WH|5.0|We are avid BVS fans!! The whole series is riveting and captivating but, Once More, With Feeling takes the cake, at least for us!<br /><br />The songs, punch lines, choregraphy, story lines are really quite good, especially when you consider what a cheesy episode it was set up to be. Then there was the other side, a very serious side, showing the strained relationships and the cracks in their facades that became bigger than Hellhole itself. It really became evident at the end of the episode, after all their secrets had been exposed, that the series was taking a dramatic change and started a whole new type of BVS.<br /><br />This soundtrack is very Broadway-esquire at times, very rock n roll-ish at other times; very dramatic then very light hearted. You will find yourself toe tapping along with the music, wanting to get up and dance, then feeling like you are floating through a Willow tree! This soundtrack really covers several different genres.<br /><br />It was also amazing to hear the voices of some of the actors, impressive!!! The depth, the style, the extreme changes to the tempo really showed off their vocal chops, to say the least! And then there were the very few who really weren't endowed with the ability of singing, it was truly impressive how they dealt with that, but didn't exclude them either.<br /><br />The smartest part of the soundtrack/episode was the traditional ending when the little hand drawn monster went over the Mutant Enemy logo, after the credits, singing the part of &#34;Grrrrr, Arrrrgh&#34;! It was just so perfect how they arranged for the monster to be a part of the soundtrack, nice job!<br /><br />If you love the Scoobies, then you will really love this soundtrack!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Now I understand why this book is a classic. Could not stop reading! Astonishing and disturbing at the same time. Highly recommended.
B00640UICA|5.0|The puzzles  are well designed. They get progressively harder without being so hard you lose interest. You meet a variety of characters.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Great reacher book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait to start the next one. Thanks Lee, keep up the great work
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It has the perfect challenge level and by far is the best free app out there. Makes the player feel like a detective and does not have annoying or frequent popups. The same background song every level is nothing a mute button cant fix. The game is addicting...cant wait for more levels!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This movie was action packed, fun to watch and always seemed to surpise you.  Would sit to watch it again!
B00EOO55GW|5.0|All I did was listen to the song 'Hail To The King' once and bought the CD via MP3 download right away. I didn't regret it at all. Two big thumbs up in my opinion. Love it and is a great addition to my Avenged collection.
B000I9U972|5.0|Yes. Very cool. Its a favorite in our home. Clasically funny and a great way to enjoy a boring afternoon.
1592537251|5.0|I grew up in the city and my mother worked in downtown Los Angeles.  Also at one point, I lived in downtown Portland, Oregon.<br />I have also spent a lot of time in downtown Seattle.  However, I have never really, since becoming a adult with free time had<br />the time nor ability it do urban sketching.  (I really am sorry I didn't think of this when I was in the service 30 years ago - I was stationed in Japan, and spent some long hours and days in Tokyo - I would like to return there today, as it was then). Oh well,<br />I purchased this book for inspiration,  to review and hopefull draw ideas from.
B008RTE066|5.0|Great remastering job and the audio sounds phenomenal! Highly recommended for any Beatles fan as this is the best this will look and sound for quite some time.
0316010669|2.0|First impressions are correct. No need to read entire book. First two chapters covered it all. Waste of time. Period
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I don't know how many people know who Lindsey Stirling is, her story or how she got to be where she is today. It is a great story. If you enjoy thematic music and a creative musician who plays violin in ways you wouldn't think you could, you'll love her music. When I play her music for others, they love it and always ask who the artist is. Hopefully we see much more from Lindsey in the years to come.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun to do while still being challenging.  Strongly recommend the game. Each floor has different twists and turns and interesting puzzles.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book. Quite a tear-jerker but in the best way possible. I suggest reading it when you're in need of a good cry.
B001L9OKZK|5.0|I NEEDED WATERSHIP DOWN FOR MY LIBRARY SO THAT MY GROWN-UP GRANDCHILDREN COULD READ IT...I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT AND AS IT IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I EVER READ, NOW I CAN LOAN IT TO THEM!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is literally the bomb! I feel like if I put my kindle down, my horse misses me!  This is great for horse lovers and its like having your own. If I could I would tell everyone I knew about this but all I can do is a review. But really. Check this app out! It's free!
1596592834|5.0|This is the best book I have read in years. In fact, I have read it twice, and have purchased copies for many people.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|well I think that this game is very addicting and fun!And I just can't stop playing it. And its a very fun app.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Thought the film was wonderful and the disk was like new, enjoyed it emensely. Love the clothes from that era.  Rose
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|It  never finish downloading.  don't  buy it  custom service  bad bad.  I sent that  thing  back  never won't  another  one. (none  as bad)  (all of it)  (bad)
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I have slowly been becoming a Blake fan. Sure would be cool is a great song. The whole CD is what we've come to expect a Shelton CD, top notch from the first cut to the last.
0061900656|5.0|I bought this book for my son while I was pregnant. He's 2.5 years old and loves the illustrations and story. Now that the baby is here, he likes for us to read it to him even more! Simple story is perfect for his age group.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Classic, funny, and great cast! I watched this movie when I was younger & I was hooked! A few dozen replays later and I'm still enjoying this movie. A must-see for any movie buff or family night in.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I found myself justified with envy in the vanity and self pride of Dorian, but in the terrible turn of outliving your loved ones and becomming lonely in a life full of companionship turned a once sweet dream to a nightmare.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|No problem using the calculator.  Numbers are large enough for ease in it's use.  I see no need for changes or improvement.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like the speed with which I can access the current weather as well as forecast for my selected locations.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great summer read.  Couldn't put it down!!  Plot twists and turns and I loved every moment of it!  Definitely recommend!
B0073V7YTY|5.0|This sound meter will display long term minimum, maximum, and the average for the period being evaluated.  Was very helpful for determining sound levels for a church worship service.  Didn't compare against a calibrated meter for accuracy, but it was still effective for finding the balance, hot spots and volume levels of the room.  Now that I have established a baseline number for the room using this app and my Kindle HD, I can compare week to week to look for changes and t help adjust settings.  Just what I needed.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|This show had me from the beginning.  Great acting and story line.  I was sad to see Dame Eileen Atkin's character suddenly dead and out of the mix by season 2.  She was extremely interesting and I loved watching her!
1451695195|5.0|This truly is an amazing book.  It's so interesting to me, that, I could not put it down until I finished.  It's a very easy read and a wonderful true story.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|This movie is a classic, though we ordered the updated version with Johnny Depp not the animated version shown here.  This was my daughter's favorite movie and will always be special.
0316154687|5.0|I'm afraid my review at this time of night will not be super helpful but suffice to say it's like any of his work.<br /><br />Easily digestible format (small stories), hilarious, endearing and moving at times.<br /><br />You'll never find a better Subway reader than this guy's books.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|grand-daughter loves it so I love it. Her and I enjoy the time together and this game becomes the catalyst for quality time spent!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This is the first mechanical watch I've owned and couldn't be happier. The strap is nylon which i don't expect but never the less can't bet the 60$ price tag. But Amazon says it retails for almost 300$ when the sticker on the box clearly says 185$. Bad form Amazon.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Helped change my life in so many ways. Good book and great ideas for someone like me. TY for the book.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I am personally not a book person and I loved this I couldn't put it down I have never found a book I love!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|My 17 year old had to read this book so I read it too. It was very well written and extremely clever. My daughter, who doesn't like to read, can't wait for the sequel . Wow!
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|After reading \\"Peter: A Darkened Fairy Tale\\" I was delighted to get the opportunity to read this awesome collection of poems based on the book.<br />With the same fairy tale feel, Peter: Enchantment & Stardust, shines light on a few secrets hidden within the dark. Another fantastical 5 star read.<br />**As with most of my reviews, I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review\\"
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Used this app for a very long time now, have never had any pop ups...ever...app runing or not.  it saves me time i can save a video to watch later.  Highly recommend.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|My preschooler and I both enjoy playing this game. It does occasionally require me to log in to the Amazon App Store before letting us play, but several of my Amazon apps require the same. I don't like that about any of them, but I'm pointing it out because I don't feel this game should be flamed for doing it, too, as if it were the only one. Most of the time we're able to play without wifi.<br /><br />Another problem is that occasionally the game gets stuck, and the net won't release the chimp to jump. When it does that, I clear the game from the Recent Apps list, and that resets it. There was at least one instance where the game froze the tablet (Nexus 7) entirely and caused it to crash. Luckily the tablet rebooted without any problems.<br /><br />I will say that as much fun as this game is, even with the beautiful graphics and replay value, if it gets any more bugs I will uninstall.

B00DQVST76|2.0|I LOVE Madonna - I've been on the latest 3 concerts of her - She IS Amazing - But, It was soooo disrespectful of been late for ALMOST 4 hours on a Tuesday night for her South Florida Fans on her concert show (AND she was very late on the other concerts as well) - It was disappointed, and good part of the crowd left even before the show starts - I \\"like\\" the concert, but wasn't closer to Confessions Tour - The DVD supposed to be recorded on that night - Not sure if it was... so much booos and empty seats after a while ... I left the show in the middle, since was past 1:00 am already, and I have babysitter to look after my kids past due her time :( - I'm sure a lot of fans was disappointed on that night too ... I felt betrayed after so many years ben a HUGE fan ...
0761119752|5.0|My 2 1/2 yo daughter loves this book (and anything Sandra Boynton has put out). Every night when we ask what stories she wants to read, Pajama Time is on the list. Sometimes my husband reads the book while getting her pajamas on. It definitely helps with the night time routine.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey tells of her journey from childhood to show business with her wit and humor. This was one of the funniest books I've read in a long time! It's a must read if you're looking for something funny and entertaining!
B008469DGY|4.0|Great little time waster... be more fun if you had a course to follow.  Perfect game for waiting rooms.  Good faotd!!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I rate this a four because it is very cool and it helps you understand what could happen to you.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My wife found 1 or 2 episodes on regular tv. It looked ok. But watching from EP 1 on It has turned out to be a really good show.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I love this movie ... its a great twist on the Pride and Prejudice story.  Loved how it kept the major aspects of the Pride and Prejudice storyline but still provided a modern take to it.  Very enjoyable!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Too much fun. Can't stop playing this game. Multiple levels keep you entertained for hours. New and old characters from the movie make appearances in the game.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Can't believe the author is a woman.  But,the male pov is hilarious.  Predictable sex scenes, but still very hot.  Good pick me up read, laugh out loud and then take your place on the analysts couch to get down to the &#34;heart&#34; of the matter. I liked that none of the characters were &#34;broken&#34;, &#34;damaged&#34;, or &#34; totally &#34; off the rails.  Can see this as a chick flick, the dialog is all there and it actually reads like a movie.  Hope the author continues with this type of novels......didn't have to wait for a sequel, either.  Good luck, Emma!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I purchased this book I also purchased three other books along with it. Not really knowing what this book was about I just figured that I would save it for last. I regret that I waited a couple of weeks to start reading this. It was everything you could want in a story and more!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"Not everyone gets a happily every after. Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope.\\"<br /><br />This is one of those books where when you begin reading it you just think it's a high school love story but boy are you wrong! Colleen Hoover came up with the ultimate twist of all twists and I loved every second of it. Literally couldn't put this book down and found myself reading into all hours of the night.<br /><br />Sky was adopted when she was 5-years-old by a woman named Karen. Karen doesn't allow her to have anything technological: television, phone, etc. She even home-schools her. Trying to venture out of her sheltered life, Sky decides she wants to go to public school for her senior year. She quickly becomes the pun of all jokes, pranks, and rumors. A hard thing for any child to face, especially one who has never had to experience such hardships before. Somehow Sky doesn't let it get to her and instead forgets by running every morning and clearing her mind.<br /><br />One day she crosses paths with a boy named Holder, who has his own set of rumors that follow him around. Their first interactions confuses Sky and leaves her wondering who this boy is and why she feels an odd connection to him. The more time they spend together the more Sky feels like she needs Holder. This is where this book becomes one of those first true love stories and I felt butterflies in my stomach because I knew exactly how she was feeling. I remembered falling in love the first time.<br /><br />\\"I live you, Sky,\\" he says against my lips. \\"I live you so much.\\"<br /><br />But just when you thought you knew how this story was going to go, BAM! You are punched in the stomach and taken for a nasty ride through the gut-wrenching plot twist.<br /><br />Get ready for Sky and Holder to dig their ways into your life so deeply that you feel as if you actually know them and want to do something, anything, in order to help them - or protect them. This story will take you through an emotional rollercoaster and there may be moments you may need, as Sky says \\"A chapter break.\\"you through an emotional rollercoaster and there may be moments you may need, as Sky says \\"A chapter break.\\"
B008RF0M9O|5.0|They come off occasionally but are fairly simple to get back on if you are slightly dextrous.<br />They feel great and it appears that I have a new head set. I also really enjoyed only paying 6$ for them, great deal.
8866135879|5.0|I purchased this to help jot down and keep track of what assignments are due when.  I also keep track of grades with it as well.  The size is perfect.  Plenty of room for all of my courses information.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I love this book.  The author gave you are the correct information on working out with weight from a beginner to all the vitamins needed to work out.
1572816295|5.0|I have had the same deck for over a decade, so I thought long and hard before purchasing these cards. However, I did not regret the decision at all when I saw the fantastical artwork. The images are fascinating and the element of wildlife incorporated into each card gives an unexpected fullness to the individual meanings.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This  app of the Bible compares many different versions, it includes Bible studies, and it is easily carried with me to study when I have extra time.  Thanks.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Simply amazing. Truly touching and makes you think about life in a new perspective. Read this and fall in love with Augustus and hazel
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great story of how love can keep us together even when our world is falling apart. I don't think the cursing and the  f  word added to the book. It was such a positive story of hope, love and need for each other, especially for teenagers, that other language would have worked better.
B00000K3UU|5.0|I was very pleased with the speedy delivery of the DVD. We lost our copy and were so excited to sit down and watch it. This movie is one of our very favorites.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Really good movie - Helen Mirren is great. Not sure about the portrayal of Prince Charles, I think he is probably stronger than portrayed. Overall a great behind the scenes movie.
B003GK21OE|4.0|always great to read Baldacci's books...... totally hooked!<br />I had to read all the other he wrote... and still wanting more :)
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Peter Dinklage and Charles Dance are the most marvelous counterpoint to each other. I await with great eagerness every scene they share.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Very interesting and engaging novel.  This fiction makes you wonder if ever this technology would be utilized to the fullest for the benefit of mankind.  I was very much engrossed in this reading.  I enjoyed it very much.
B00915G6MG|5.0|A lot of tear-jerkers in this season.  But LOVE it.  Still, the best TV show of ALL-TIME.  DVDs were fine too, luckily.
0307352153|4.0|\\"Quiet\\" was an immense help to me.<br /><br />I'm not a labeler and not terribly in touch with all my brain's or body's nuances. Cancer is definitively cancer, but other medical, physiological, and psychological labels are often definitively fuzzy.<br /><br />As Christians, labeling introverts and extroverts should happen after we are sure we are committed to the first and second commandments (Matthew 22). We should shore ourselves up on being willing to do anything God calls us to do and willing to do community and share the Gospel.<br /><br />After that is a good time to pick up \\"Quiet.\\" There were many things that were immensely helpful to me in this book, helping me to see what the natural propensities of an introvert and extrovert really are, better understanding how people get motivated and thrive and work better.<br /><br />A conclusive either/or label doesn't work well either. I am an introvert at my core. At the same time, I have almost no stage-fright and am not shy, especially with strangers. Except for my freshman year of college probably, I've been in leadership or executive positions continuously since high school and have been the head of a school for the since age 22. But I'm not chatty, much prefer quiet evenings at home to social events, and am much more productive behind closed doors.<br /><br />The science behind the book was interesting and the refusal to be cut and dry was refreshing. The illustrations were helpful and the general usefulness was not slight to help me understand why it's perfectly ok for me to not drive myself toward our culture's extrovert ideal.<br /><br />This book is helpful for adults and parents willing to wade in.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|We make this a family tradition! For all those Muppet & upcoming Muppet fans.<br />Grandparent, Children and grandchildren love this timeless classic with a fun twist.<br />Many phrases actually taken from Dickens novel.  Great scenery and humor too.
0066620996|4.0|Helpful, substantial, leadership and business lessons en masse. These apply slightly less to non-profits, so I'm interested in reading the follow-up monograph Collins wrote geared to non-profits.<br /><br />Interesting and universal principles that should be heard by all workers in almost all industries charged with the care of a product or company.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It was OK I couldn't quite get the object of what I was aiming for accomplishing.  When I wanted to come out could not find a way so had to turn off my Kindle and restart which frustrated me...
0143120530|2.0|This was an interesting narrative that revolved around the author going from interested reporter to ultimately winning the US Memory Championship.<br /><br />As a helpful guide, there was some help in there and some points that should be knocked around. The bulk of the book though was mostly gimicky ways of learning random trivia or obscure numbers or cards. There were tips that are very helpful and a good amount of research. It is helpful to me to learn how to memorize lists of data spatially.<br /><br />Can this book be a help to better ground oneself in good, true and beautiful? Maybe.
B008469DGY|4.0|Easy to learn, difficult to master.  The courses are very scenic and unique.  A good way to pass the time.
B005544V6A|5.0|I really enjoy this show. Gives you an appreciation for the finer things in life.  the nightly power struggles along with the moral decisions made by the lead characters keeps me interested.
B00006JSS8|5.0|So many singable songs. My Fourteen year old loves it too!  Wish he still did what he did when he was young!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I am way too old to be watching this show.  Thanks, amazon prime, for supplying it to me for free!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked how well written  it was ,an easy read and most of all you care about the characters. A tragedy but you see growth.
0425261360|2.0|This book was rather disappointing to me because of the way it was written.  Let me explain.  While it is true that the story deals with death, forensics, investigators and medical examiners, I find the tremendous amount of field-specific terminology annoying.  Lots of abbreviations are used, and not clarified until a couple of chapters following.  There are so many medical terms (ok, so the main character is a doctor), but there has to be a limit.  When you find page after page after page full of terminology the general public is not familiar with, you start skipping, looking to get back to the story.<br /><br />The conversations between any characters are so technical and lofty that one can quickly lose interest.  I am well educated, but I don't work in forensics or the medical field, and if I have to look up every other word in a novel, I'm going to lose interest very quickly.<br /><br />Another problem I have with this story, and the characters basically, is that this is not supposed to be a comic book story about superheroes, yet Scarpetta and her niece Lucy, wow, so much technology.  Lucy, particularly, can hack into any computer, tracks EVERYONE's movements, has choppers, computer systems galore...  Oh, come on.  Characters, for me anyway, need to be at least a bit believable.  None of the ones in this story are the least bit genuine.  No one talks like they do and no one lives like they do.  No one.  If I can't relate, at least on some level, I find it very hard to care about any of them.<br /><br />Lastly, there is so much build-up and if you can cut through all the above, there is a decent plot going on here.  The problem comes in when all the sub-plots begin to link up; or at least, when the attempt is made to link them up.  The truth unfolds in the last few pages really, and very quickly, and none it it really makes sense.  Killers don't make sense, I'm sure, but in this story?  You are really left wondering.  It is as if it builds up and then really lets you down.  It's like, you have to be kidding...<br /><br />I know I sound really critical, but I have read a lot by Cornwell, and have always enjoyed her books very much.  This one really surprised me.  I made up my mind that I was going to finish it and hoped it would get easier to read and to follow, but unfortuntately, it let me down.  When it ended, I was kind of relieved.  Way too over the top.s you down.  It's like, you have to be kidding...<br /><br />I know I sound really critical, but I have read a lot by Cornwell, and have always enjoyed her books very much.

B007BVOEPI|5.0|I was not going to like this series, but it grows on you; great writing and costumes and characters; love it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There is nothing positive to be said about this book.  The writing is sophmoric, and the premise is ridiculous.  No one can have as many orgasms as Ana, and either Christian is superman or he would be dead from the number of sexual encounters in which he engages.  The sex scenes are so repetitive as to be stultifyingly dull.  The whole S&M theme is neither well researched nor tittilating.<br />Folks who want to pursue the theme would be well advised to read Anne Rice's beauty series, and save their money on this tripe.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I guess it helps to come in with low expectations.<br />This remake was nothing like what I remember of the original.<br />But this one flowed, and the plot was surprisingly tight.<br />There were a couple of cool twists as well.<br />Boy, the future looks bleak - I hope I don't live to be 90 :-P
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We were glued to the screen every Sunday night for 3 seasons of Downton Abbey, and it's just as wonderful the second time around!  It might even be better, because you can pick up on little details you missed the first time.  One of the best PBS shows ever!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Best ever free game.  I play it just about everyday...its really fun.  This is worth buying add on's, if they plan on making any.
B000092R9F|4.0|Gabriel fans don't give this a lot of love but if you take it as a stand alone recording I like it very much. When you're aware he was going through a divorce during this period the tone of the recording makes a lot of sense. The SACD version is a vast improvement over the Redbook CD.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|People tell me to get stones and use that.  But this thing simply makes doing all that unnecessary.  Sharpen every couple uses and your good to go.  Razor sharp.  I have one for camping, in the shop, and in the kitchen and they make that perfect gift for someone who has everything.  Have 4 waiting as emergency gifts.
B000FIHCYE|4.0|This replaces the SACD version of this recording and sounds much, much better. I'm generally a big fan of the SACD format but they really blew it on this recording.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Defending Jacob was OK.  If you want a book with better literary content, I would read The Busey Boys.  Both cover very similar situations but the later is much better written.
B00004XPPC|5.0|Alec Guiness is outstanding in this film.  The scenery is remarkable and the film is very realistic.  Not really a &#34;war movie&#34; - more of a movie about courage and honor under horrible conditions

B00EUVC26U|5.0|A number of fans of \\"police procedurals\\" have taken issue with investigators' tactics.  Having never conducted a criminal investigation, I can't address these issues.  I find Broadchurch a compelling psychological thriller, and am fascinated as one detail after another in each character's life is revealed.  I love the way the series insists that no one is above suspicion, and the unexpected ways in which the characters' lives are intertwined.  I c an't wait for the next episode!
0066620996|5.0|Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't. This is one of my favorite books. It is automatically GREAT! It gives the reader a plethora of strategies to move from goodness to greatness. Excellent Read!!
B00EEL0LGY|5.0|I have this game since a couple of days and I love it. Simple.<br /><br />I've always love to play games with motorbikes (I know, they are not  motorbikes), not much really with cars. I found Riptide GP2 and thought it could be a good purchase (by the way play google doesn't accept my card perhaps I'm from Peru, but fortunately the amazon market works perfect) and I've to say that it's a pleasure to play this game everyday. I am not a dedicated gamer, actually I have to work so I prefer simpler games that doesn't take much of my time.<br /><br />It feels amazing with the well thought design of effects and urban landscapes that are far away of similar android games, it's strange and haunting the water circuit, and... well I think I have desire to play it again now lol.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|This is unquestionably Justin Hayward's best solo album ever. In fact, it's better than any Moody Blues album since Long Distance Voyager - and that's quite a long distance indeed. If it wasn't for the unfortunate and incomprehensible inclusion of the rotten Rincon remix of Out There Somewhere, I would give this album the full 5 stars:<br /><br />Someday, Someway is the best song the Moodies never did. A gorgeously soaring, wonderfully evocative, inspirational work that ranks with any of Hayward's finest. The rest of the songs range from okay to good to really good (In Your Blue Eyes, On the Road to Love). And thankfully, gone is the dead weight of John Lodge and Graeme Edge; who in keeping with Justin's best musical interests, are hereby, and forever, relegated to the category of \\"Unnecessary Excess Baggage\\" (exception: both Mike Pinder and Ray Thomas come back).<br /><br />Who would've thought that this man would produce work of this caliber in his late sixties, or is it seventies now??? Exceptional.
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|If you only watch the first 15 minutes, you might think there is no narrative. But by the end of the film, the various patterns and connections become beautifully and painfully clear.
B004INNRFK|5.0|I absolutely love these compilations of songs and singers!  I have the first of<br />Hit Man and am looking at other David Foster CD's.  The best for me is the<br />variety of singers and the styling of the recordings.  You get the best of so<br />many artists all in one CD...that is what I like!
B002O2THRO|4.0|I wanted to see the new Gatsby movie so I thought I would watch this one first.  Overall, really glad I watched it.  I love old classics!!
B001EC2IXK|5.0|This movie was oned of the greatest.  It had great acting, a great story, and an amazing presentation.  Newman was at his best as was George Kennedy.  Everyone played their parts well.  Even Boss Paul (da man wit no eyes) played his part very well with very little if any dialogue.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I started watching this series a couple weeks ago and have to watch one per night.  Just plain brilliant
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Definitely keeps your attention from episode to episode.  Good tension building as the season progresses to the final episode and an excellent cast.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I'm not one to write reviews, but I was incredibly disappointed in this book. I watched the movie first and thought it was fantastic, so I decided to read the book. The main character, Pat, has a very immature and child-like voice, which, I'm sure is the author's point, but I felt disconnected from him from the beginning. The plot is great, but just watch the movie and skip the book.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|If you like period pieces, this is great.  Nice and light hearted.  Accurate, well produced.  Suitable for everyone. Wish there were more seasons than 4.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really like this game it is really fun I enjoy being able to make my dream city I really recommend. this game
057809665X|4.0|Let me start by admitting I'm not a wordsmith (as this review will no doubt prove). I found the book to be helpful and contain some good ideas. The author uses his own experience of using the technique to show how one might apply it themselves, and substantiate that in some instances it works. Previous lessons are reinforced in later lessons, and I admit I found this helpful in reminding me what I had learned, and how to  use that chapters lesson in conjunction with previous lessons.<br />With just 102 pages, it is something you can read in one sitting, but definitely something you will want to pick up again and refresh yourself on.<br /><br />The only issue I had with this book is the authors style of writing. He comes from a military and governmental background, and this comes across in his style of writing. Whilst not akin to reading a police report, it was, in my opinion, not as fluid and engaging as other books I have enjoyed. Don't let this dissuade you from reading this book, writing style preference is very personal and you may thoroughly enjoy the writing style. Whilst not in love with the writing style, I would consider another book by this author given how insightful this book was.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I've seen this movie numerous times , great for kids I highly recommend renting or purchasing for your own video collection
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is the story of a man returning to a place of magic and strangeness from his childhood and finding it just as magical and strange as it was when he first visited the strange family at the end of the lane as a boy. The story begins with the suicide of a boarder in the boy's family that, because of the man's greed, opens an access to another realm in which destructive creatures cause some very real damage. He meets the girl from the end of the lane and they go out to stop the creatures (one of whom is disguised as a governess or au pair and almost destroys the boy's family). As with all things Gaiman, I would recommend it for lovers of fantasy and magic.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|Catching up on the series, missed a lot of the episodes during its initial run, have enjoyed revisiting the story line
B00969GFFU|1.0|I picked up 'Freedom' based on my enthusiasm for 'The Corrections'.<br />I try to read at least the first 100 pages of any book to give it a fair chance of development. I was quite ready to give up on this one early. The story is pointless. The characters, although well developed, give rise to a total lack of interest in them or their fate. How the same author can create such a great book with 'The Corrections' and the literary disaster of 'Freedom' puzzles me.
B0094WK9EC|5.0|A great album with a lot of great music. I hope they produce more albums in the future. Listening to this album makes me wish they put out additional music.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Enjoyed each character's film individually...which made the collection of the entire group that much more satisifying! Look forward to Avengers 2.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Great movie. Good family film. No blood and guts. Just a classic film. Would highly recommend  . Nice to see with your loved ones
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|Originally missed season 1 and did not fully understand the history behind SOA. Finding a lot of answers in season 1. Excellent foundation for the continuing saga.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I am happy to click a star but making me write a review is intrusive, so, in the future I will delete the request
B008Y79IUE|2.0|This movie was very dark and disturbing. At the end, I was ashamed that I had watched it. I don't recommend.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great read!  I have always been fascinated with WWII and was taken to a place, that made me smile and made me sad.  Great book!!!
B004WJRFYE|5.0|Paul must have been having a blast recording on his own and at home for his first solo album. Still one of my favorite McCartney albums. Sounds even better on the new remastered 180 gram vinyl. Love the bonus disc tunes too!.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|It takes nerve to use a wonderful book like A Wrinkle in Time as a tough stone for your novel but Ms Stead completely pulls it off. A delightful book for all ages!
B000FC130E|5.0|Excellent , a really well told story.  It's rare to have book that is so hard to put down.  The characters are compelling and entertaining.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|It is more of a character movie rather than any other type.  It shows life...changes and growth.  Great cast remarkable cast
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Though it takes a while to get rolling and understand their local accents, the series is great.  I am a big fan of &#34;The Killing&#34; and this British series is similar in that it appears it will take the entire season to solve the murder.  It's wonderfully done and is imaginative in that our American television seems to be lacking in that area and there are entirely too many so-called reality shows.  The acting is great and the characters are varied.  Get caught up and tune in!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|If I ever thought I wanted to be a chef, after reading this  book, I know I made the right decision not to even consider it. MR. BOURDAIN really was great in his depiction of the underbelly of the restaurant trade. I would recommend this book as a must read. Great job.
B00915G6MG|5.0|My friends wondered where I got a copy, they haven't seen it in the stores. Amazon is the place to go. Love, love, love NCIS....I watch reruns on tv and then get out my collection and watch more.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|One mor of Christie's masterpiece. Interesting, fun, timeless. I also enjoyed her use of the UK English language. Great read!
B000QGEB12|5.0|I loved this film from start to end! Great plot, great storyline! A+ film!! It's a wonderful, fun family film!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I've tried others, like Gmail, I also have hotmail (NOT LIKE IT AT ALL)...YAHOO MAIL is my wonderful way to communicate with everyone. I also enjoy the \\"emoticons\\" (Those of Hotmail are soooo boring). I use them a lot. HOTMAIL used to be ok, but now, with all these \\"renovations\\"....boooo! YAHOO!...Go for it!
B00DKMWOWM|3.0|I'm not too sure how to describe this book.<br /><br />First, let me say that I did enjoy the story. For those only marginally acquainted with he subject, the Shinsengumi were supposed to be a pseudo-police force to protect the Shogun at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate. They failed, on many levels. the Shinsengumi have a special place in the hearts and history of the Japanese - the closest parallel I can think of is the Texas Rangers, and even then that is not a good comparison. The Shinsengumi have been portrayed in film and anime (most notably Rurouni Kenshin for anime and, well, Shinsengumi with Toshiro Mifune for film); it's through anime that I became interested in knowing more.<br /><br />The good parts: There is a lot of information here. This is the scholarly part. Mr. Hillsborough does a good job of telling the story of the Shinsengumi, explaining the historical setting and giving insight into the characters and their motivations. Footnotes and textual explanations while not copious are sufficient.<br /><br />The bad parts: somehow, even though we are talking only a period of some 6 years the story seems short, almost a sketch. Dry. Bring a bottle of water with you dry. And, one of the most dramatic moments of the Shinsengumi - one of the most dramatic moments in Japanese history, the incident at Ikeda'ya - is pretty unsatisfying. Accurately portrayed I have no doubt but somehow lacking.<br /><br />For a student of Japanese history and culture, this is a good book and does the job well and I do recommend it for this reader. For the casual reader in Japonica, maybe not so much.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This game should be called &#34;Patience&#34;....Which I don't have a lot of....No &#34;skills&#34; needed, other than that, PATIENCE!! Boring game.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I thought that this season was very good. I really thought that they did a good job in keeping things very tense and suspenseful and keeping the viewers wanting to know what was gonna happen next. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because I thought that previous seasons were better. I did not like that they were caught up in the prison for so long and I did not like the way that the town was portrayed. I feel like there were more intangible conflicts that actual physical ones but that is just based on my preference.
034580404X|5.0|The books came looking brand new and my mom loved them! So it was a good buy i do think.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|What I like about this app is that you can highlight, underline, and add notes in the margins of your reading material.  I also like being able to access my reading material without being on line.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Another cool Big Fish game app! All of their game apps have great graphics, are easy to navigate and hours of play fun!  And you get  to try them all free and buy to unlock if you like it!  Once you try it , you're hooked!<br /><br />Enigmatic is set in a sleepy and kinda creepy town where you're &quot;puzzle solving&quot; detective skills are put to the test.  Hours of fun!<br /><br />Hey Big Fish!  Keep the game apps coming!  And how about a discount or package deal for two or more app purchases?  That would be great!
1609611543|5.0|I bake bread every week and eat it too. I am very careful with my diet and was unable to loose weight. Once I stopped baking and buying bread, I started to lose weight. I am a believer now! I do not stop and buy bagels to take to work, but buy apples, much healthier.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My daughter is the latest fan of this movie. I received the movie it was in great condition. Thank you
0062255657|4.0|I thought it was interesting at 1st and then I got really angry (which is a good sign bc it means I care about the characters) and then I took a nap. The most amazing thing happened, I had a bad dream about this book! I love that, I never had a bad dream about a book before. So then when I woke up I started readying again and I LOVED the rest of the book. I loved the ending even though it made me a little sad. I am a cat person so that was an added bonus. After I was finished reading I read that this author also wrote Stardust and I loved that movie so now I am excited to read more of his work. (I usually prefer to read rather than watch, but after I watch I can't go back and read. So no reading Stardust for me.) I recommend this book. I read a review with two stars that said that they felt it would be better as a short story. I can actually see that, So I can tell this author is good at short stories and can't wait to dig in to his collections.
B001FAFO3W|4.0|Made the purchase to add to my collection for my granddaughter and my nieces when they come by to visit
B00C0IYPRY|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite 80's movie. I had to introduce it to my teenage daughter. I love it every time I watch it. We even enjoyed the 80's fashions which have become the fashion of today again!
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Made me a hit with my granddaughter. This was a old favorite with my daughter and now Its a hit with my granddaughter
B008469DGY|5.0|man this is an awesome game I haven't played a game like this one in a long time.  Graphics and sound are out of this world too. e
B003DZX3SA|5.0|is my daughter's favorite  movie.  She is now 22, but the Beauty and the Best as always been her favorite.  Wanted to get it before it got put into the vault.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I got this item to Sharp my knives out Camping And hunting And I'm very happy with it. It's well made strong sharpens fast. The Diamond edge Pull out Rod is awesome for Serrated edges works good. It's small to carry in your Pocket or bag. It has a loop hole if you want to hang it on your keychain or bag. If your looking for a razors Edge it comes close.  What I don't like is it Doesn't have a finger Guard and it's not that good to use on small Scissors no room To maneuver it. be Very careful when using this Sharpener. Definitely worth having in your bag your Car or just in your garage.<br />Well worth the money I will be purchasing more.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|this was my 22-year-old's first movie when she was two years old. She loved it and I had to get her a copy before it went back into the vault.  Great for any collection.
B008469DGY|5.0|I downloaded this thinking,I may not care to much about it. But I was wrong. I haven't stop playing it. Very addictive..
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This movie is one of a kind. Everyone needs to watch and have a copy of this one.  Love Keaton and Nicholson together.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great characters! Great story lines! Just a lot of fun. No idea why this show wasn't on the air for years and years.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|this movie was fantastic. Clint Eastwood at his best.  My family used to have a Torino, so it added to watching it a little. Great moral story.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Great action and tough cop sci fi nonstop action movie from the begging through the end of this movie.what a picture this movie is.
B000EGDB10|5.0|This one was my favorite.  Of course, it was the first one Cruise did.  They are always the best.  Great movie to add to collection.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app. I am waking on time now and im not late anymore. Especially wen i am by myself.
B001C08RHA|5.0|The first of the trilogy.  Can't wait for others to be made and released.  Just another great movie to add to my Downey collection.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Watched this on tv so time ago but never had time to watch the whole thing, now I can watch it when ever and it's a good price for the set.
B003UYV08E|5.0|is a GREAT movie.  I am an Iron Man addict so this one was great to add to my Downey collection. He is my favorite actor so it is always nice to add to my Downey collection.  He is awesome as Sherlock Holmes as well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Well I was worried about spending 3 dollars for this game and only to turn out to be a waste but it wasn't a waste and the good thing was it was and may still be on sale for only 1 dollar....... but over all it was very interesting and a long game of you don't use any hints and try to figure out the game the right way.... try it you will also love it....
B00006JSS8|5.0|I have played and played and played this CD and NEVER get tired of hearing it.  He made such nice music and so many good memories while listening.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Loved reading the banter between the characters the twists and turns etc those who can get past the raunch will enjoy a great novel
6305949980|5.0|for any collection.  This is my daughter's favorite movie so I got her this for Christmas for her collection. She loves it.
B004X80QNG|1.0|I agree with a another review, how can they pass this off as a 9.99 app when this is v2 and they have released v3?  Luckily for me it was the free app of the day, but I still uninstalled it immediately. Amazon is partially at fault for offering an out of date app and showing a regular price of 9.99
B002ZG981E|5.0|was one of my ex-boyfriend's movies.  Bought it for him for Christmas because he enjoyed it so much in the theatre.
B001SKB1Y0|5.0|Really good movie with a lot of suspense.  You will never guess the ending.  I have rented it twice.  I think I will purchase itl.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This is a GREAT one.  As far as I'm concerned, Christian Bale is the best batman of all the actors that have played him.  When he no longer plays Batman I will no longer follow the movie.
0743243153|4.0|Bought as a gift and is exactly what I expected! Same copy I bought 40 years ago! A book all should read!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|movie with a great message.  I could not resist getting my own copy of this one.  Saw it in the theatre and had to have one of my own!
0517543052|4.0|Bought as a gift and is exactly what I expected! Same copy I bought 40 years ago! A book all should read!
B002VECM6S|5.0|love to see these when they are REAL stories.  This was a touching story that my brother and sister-in-law loved so I gave it to them as a Christmas gift.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This app is so fun and very addictive I love playing this game it really feels like you can go around and we eat anything you want to. You can eat stuff like sting rays
B00003CXDG|5.0|Hard to decide if I liked this one better than the first one.  It was fantastic.  Classic Cruise.  Great movie.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|The writing in this book, was as creative as any I have read in this genre.  I found myself reading much longer than I intended to, or wanted to, on a number of occasions.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|These are all the original Batman movies.  I had no idea that even George Clooney played Batman once.  Great for any Batman buff.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|I'm so glad they are releasing The Next Generation in HD! It puts a new spin on a favorite show from my younger days!
B0013FDM7E|5.0|This movie had so many unexpected twists and turns....Great story about a great person that gave his all!  Loved it.
B001TH16DI|5.0|The Hi-Def restoration of these memorable films is amazing to say the least! This is a much-needed update to bring them into the 21st century. The special features are just icing on the cake! You won't get a better bang for your buck than this collection!
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|Batman.  No one can play this part as well as Bale.  It will be like Bond though, he will be replaced and then I won't be watching the new Batman movies.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|This ongoing project to upgrade The Next Generation to high definition is a huge success! I didn't think it could get any better when I was watching as a kid/teenager. It puts a new spin on timeless stories!
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Great movie..  remember seeing it at the drive-in as a kid.  any war movie that was on Saturday nights at the drive in we were there.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Whether you watched the Original Series when it aired or have never seen the Original Series, this is a must for any Star Trek enthusiast. I mean, this is the series that started it all! All the episodes are in their fully restored glory with updated special effects! If you're a fan of the original special effects, you can toggle between the two. Hours and hours of quality entertainment! What more could you ask for?
B009TSA7MA|4.0|Film, color and sound is pretty cool; I would buy this disc for that reason, plus the fact that it contains Michael Schenker who is certainly an amazing musician.  Mostly older material is included in the performance.  Not sure about the beginning, almost like a prayer for ending wars; however no real elaboration anywhere else in the footage concerning the opening as a focal point or message?
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I find it addictive and challenging.  I wish I knew more about how to get the most out of this game.  I do learn more each time I play. I doing o.k. for someone over 50.
B00BNWWVFG|2.0|Felt like I needed to take a long shower to wash it off afterwards, tho.......I doubt I will ever watch it again.  Left me hollow.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is really wonderful. Can't wait till Season 4. I couldn't stop watching Season 3, the cliff hanger was a big surprise.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|Since 2010, my daughter receive this kind of doll for Christmas, Its one of her preferd gits from Santa, so cute, so beautiful. Perfect!
0345803507|3.0|James pens an engaging story that proves happiness is something to fight for with \\"Fifty Shades Freed.\\" Anastasia marries Christian, but immediately finds his lifestyle uncomfortable. Complicating matters is Jack Hyde's pursuit to ruin Christian's life. Despite mounting problems, can Ana and Christian stay together, or will they be torn apart for good?<br /><br />The story starts with Ana and Christian on their honeymoon. Security is heightened due to Jack Hyde being free. When the couple comes home, they face increasing challenges - Ana's wanting to retain her sense of individuality and worth, Hyde's capture then escape, and Ray's accident. As the challenges mount, will the stress tear the couple apart?<br /><br />James' style is easy to read, though the novel is written in the first person, present tense. While I'm used to the style now, there are times when it slows down the storytelling.<br /><br />James' strength is character development. Christian's journey will tug on the reader's heartstrings as he struggles with self-worth and insecurity. Ana is steadfast and the one constant in his life that offers hope.<br /><br />While several events occur that are meant to be challenges to the characters' change of relationship, they felt contrived and forced, including the events surrounding Jack. The plot isn't as fluid as in previous books, but the character growth proved compelling and worth the read.<br /><br />The novel is intended for mature readers with sexually charged erotic scenes. Overall, \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" is a satisfying conclusion to the series.
B004TI5N38|1.0|The dialogue between the characters is combative for no good reason. The characters never get along. The plot is very slow and uninteresting- I got 40 percent through the book thinking it would get better, but it didn't.  I am going to take a long break from Baldacci now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great illustrations and the puzzles really make you think creatively to solve.  This app is very different from others I've tried.  I even enjoyed watching family members try all the levels while I watched.  Can't wait for more levels to be released!
B002RKSZS0|1.0|Not my cup of tea...now I know why it was free. Have not read any of her other books, so I cannot compare, but I certainly would not recommend this one!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love Nathan Fillon!  Love this series...  So happy to have this in my library and not have to hope someone will run it on TV.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|McConaughey nails this part, everyone in the movie does a great job, very entertaining movie. They need to turn another one of the books into a move...
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Being a fan of the show since the '60s, I've always wanted to get some of the Start Trek TV shows on ßeta, VHS, DVD or Blu-Ray but they've always been too expensive. Why is it with about the same number of episodes is The Munsters, Bewitched, or Hogan's Hero's etc 1/2 to 1/10 the the cost of Star Trek? It's because they can... I just don't volunteer to be ripped off. But this New Set is much more affordable (but still on the high side). They've really cleaned up the picture though, and done a lot of work. Every episode is rich and colorful. At first I was wary about the updated special effects... but the vast majority of them are an improvement of the dated and grainy orignals. And if you like, you can watch the episodes with the original effects intact.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a big fan of minecraft and my friend said there was a minecraft for the smart phone and i thought i was in the hather or cloud 9. :) I was in shock of how close the game was to the minecraft on the computer. I've ben playing pocket edition  for about  a year now and i still love it!!! It gets me thinking what's next... All i say is that i hope all of to you love it as much as i do.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|While I found the book fascinating, I was disappointed neither version of the ship sinking and following story were officially confirmed.  I rather enjoyed and chose to believe the initial one.
0062082353|5.0|One of the best autobiographies I've read. In my opinion, it's better than 'no easy day' and 'lone survivor', but that's just me. An easy read, very interesting and keeps you hooked till the end. I would recommend this book to anyone. A pricelss piece of modern American war history that everyone should read at least once. I'm proud to own this book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Simple enough for my 6 year old to play this game and win levels with ease.  Plays well on Nabi.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app when I'm in outdoor it tell you where is exactly the storm is. I strongly recomende
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie, the kids all love it.  They are 12 and 8 years old, and both of them liked it.  We cant wait to see the second one!
B00EEN7CAK|5.0|Since this movie is based on a true story the entire plot was very believable (I actually remember reading about this when it happened!).  Emma Watson is great in this movie and has a very good directing style by Sophia Coppla.  I would highly recommend this movie!
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|ihave a kindle but this game keeps forcecloseing. I have it on my iphone. and really enjoyed it I'm disappointed it rodent work on my kindle. please fixedly
B000EBD9TY|4.0|All the icons--author Tennessee Williams, actors Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando. Intense, emotional, and tragic. New Orleans--perfect background for this tour de force of human nature and desires, complex and dysfunctional relationships, Southern madness, misplaced loyalties, and greed.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I love amazon's website so much that I truly believe they are Awesome!<br /><br />Please keep my family's account safe from internet hackers!<br /><br />Please protect our id's with amazon!<br /><br />We appreciate your secure website for entertainment purposes!<br /><br />Always remember to keep your Excellent Customer Services for all us thank you very much!<br /><br />Sincerely your number one customer, Jessie Bee!<br /><br />P.S. Don't stop Believing in your customers, and we won't stop Believing Customer Service Assistants!
B0088WLM9K|3.0|Not bad. But not very good either. More SciFi drama, which sometimes, especially in the beginning, is very routine and boring. Not a gripping or strong story line.
B004KPLVYA|5.0|The best thing about this story is that (essentially, at least) it's true!  I'm not a golfer, and you don't have to be one to appreciate this film and the achievement of the central character.  This is truly a remarkable story, and its presentation in this film is exceptional.  I highly recommend this film for all members of your family.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoy the history of time mingled with the day to day live of those who lived in that century.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show with a lot of action, I love the plot. Also has a lot if good actors. Waiting on the next season!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome so far. don't really have any complaints. the graphics are really cool and its nice how the scenery changes every now and then. definately worth downloading
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a nice twist to the traditional Mahjong with different forms of play that make the game interesting. Tile sets also change for a more challenging game play.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Good movie with some excellent CG & a cast that I personally think blew the original film out of the water.
B004X2M3N8|4.0|Dr. Who is the best and amy pond is a beautiful goddess end of story... Who is river song? Hehe
B004HD61KE|4.0|From today's technology to our country's past, intertwined in such a way the pages kept turning. It was interesting how Mormonism, science, native Americans and our founding fathers were woven together. I really enjoyed how the author explains fact from fiction. A fun and very interesting read.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This purchase was for birthday present needless to say the birthday girl was very pleased and this is one of her favorite movies -
B00280LYHS|5.0|Loved this book! Exciting plot twists at every turn! Annabeth was my favorite character because of her mysterious background with Luke and Thalia.
B00004SEWN|4.0|Enjoyed listening to this album. The melodic/80's style &#34;hair band&#34; rock is refreshing. He has a great voice, the words are good as great musicians playing for him.
B000XXTCF8|5.0|I especially like Greatest Hits collections that include pre-solo years, such as Van's years with Them in this case. Enjoying it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I love this show.  Series got better as the number of movies grew.  Love it. Great to share with family for sure.
B00985E3UG|4.0|Outlines in detail why the manufacturers of processed foods cannot cut down on sugar, salt and fat. A valuable insight into an industry that surrounds us all day and night.<br /><br />Gave 4 stars only because the numbering of the notes was missing from the kindle text. 5+ for the content.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I didn't have a major problem with my stock keyboard, but love Swift Key.  It makes typing on a glass surface so much easier.  It's predictive text is awesome.  Picked this up for free and couldn't be happier.
0307950689|5.0|Really enjoyed this latest Robert Langdon adventure.  The plot moved along quickly with many unexpected twists.  I never expected the ending.  If you've enjoyed other Dan Brown reads, you'll enjoy this.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Exciting but not nailbiting. A bit more time on the danger adjectives.<br /> Characters are good, the scenery well described. Young girls probably love it.
B002DMJLTE|5.0|This came out around the time of that other asteroid impact movie, but is much better. It has some time spent on the space mission, but the story of what is happening on the planet below takes center stage.
1451627289|5.0|This was my first Stephen King book. Not one that I would normally buy. One all my all time best.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|this is a very nice cover for a good price.  I am particularly pleased that it is made to protect the edge of the kindle when used in leaning position.  the texture of the cover keeps the kindle from collapsing if it slides, which many of the others do not.  it also has a sturdy stretch band to hold it closed.  all in all a good buy.  and it is purple -- her favorite -- immediately identifiable.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|If you love Hossenini's other novels, you are sure to love this one as well.  Although it starts slow, the plot picks up swiftly after the first few chapters.  I love how the story line is entangled with rich history and accurate details of events and the lifestyle in the Middle East.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Sound quality is quiet good, I have hear better in wired headphones but not by much. The battery life is fantastic and it works while it is plugged in and charging. The range is fantastic for pratical gaming use. I've had the headset last more then 6 hours of constant game play without charging, I have also listen to music while i mowed the lawn though I will admit it did cut out when I got a little ways from the house (about 40-50ft).<br />I have to commend this headset, bought several of them because of how well they work. Low price of 80-100$ is well with budget. the boom can take some breaking in at first, it doesn't like to stay where you want it out of the box but after a week or so it starts to stay where you want it. I haven't had any problem with the programmable keys. I actually have my keys change between computers and the center as a 2nd PTT.<br />The only real down side to this head is the plastic construction. At first I was worried about this because I tent to grab my headset and slam it on my desk when I rage quit at a video game, the only thing I have had break on one of these head sets is the boom for the microphone, which a mixture of gorilla glue and hot glue fixed it with no problem.<br /><br />If you have any questions feel free to contact me at Kyle.martin@yahoo.com
B00AEBB9O6|5.0|Very real.  I was in 1 fire fight.  VERY REALISTIC.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this with my husband. We don't have kids (unless you count him) so we really had no excuse but curiosity and it was lucky we did. It was really quite fun.
B006P8KWYA|5.0|I love to listen to this 'lullaby' album when I'm going to sleep. I especially love 'beautiful boy' and ' the first time ever I saw your face' , but all the songs are excellent!
B000GCFY0I|4.0|What a SUBTLE social commentary. I actually liked it don't let the sarcasm fool you. It is a good read but the latter books leave much to be desired.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This app has all the answers, yet have I been unable to find what I'm looking for. Would like to see a voice text to speech option though.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I hate to admit it but I really like this one. It was naughty but still had a realness to it. It was dark and I  found the main character a bit whiny but oh what fun.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The app works pretty well.  I don't like the constant banner ads at the bottom of the screen, but for a free app, I guess I shouldn't complain.
B00CDCLL1A|3.0|I really wanted to love it. I really did. I read the book saw the movie in theaters and still could not make up my mind. I watched it again and thought this could really be great but something just doesn't work. It is a fun watch but their is something missing.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I love this album more than any other music I've heard in ages! I've been a long-time fan of Fall Out Boy and think this album is their best yet!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I loved this book. I loved the structure, the multiple writing styled, the stories everything. If you saw the movies and were confused/concerned let me just say the book was so much better.
B008469DGY|4.0|In a sense it is similar to golf as it doesn't seem to have a major driving force...but all in all a real Nice game to collapse to after a long game. Rewarding sound effects :P
B008476HBM|4.0|It does meander a bit in the middle but it is a classic for a reason. I will always enjoy this book.
B0085PFG1U|4.0|Nice and intuitive design. Possibility to solve equations graphically. Would be nice to have independent zooms on the two axes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have one complaint. Why are they making me wait so long for the next season. Season two was a bit blah but season three more than makes up for that.
B0036K3OFY|4.0|It really is true. I enjoy this movie every time I see it. It gets such a bad rap but if you don't take it too seriously you will definitely enjoy it.
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|I loved these two. It was so dark and gothic that even my husband didn't mind sitting through it. Definite Yes!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It was alright in itself, but not as good as the first one. I am debating whether it is worth reading the next one.
B0014DQSGW|5.0|I recommend that everyone watch this. Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are in their prime. It is hilarious and a definite must see.
B0060CTLOI|4.0|I loved this movie as a kid and still do. It is right up there with Mulan in my book. Even adults can appreciate it.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This was surprisingly good. I was skeptical after the last debacle but this one was really fun without being over the top and they handle the time travel well.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Needless to say this was amazing and I have watched it way too many times already. It never gets old.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love bingo play a lot with mom and I like to play slots wish they amore. It has lot of gamelots to chos
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very eye opening as far as interaction between the the downstairs staff and the &#34;quality&#34; bred people upstairs.  Had the impression that on many levels they treated each other as extended family rather employee-staff.<br />An enthralling series.  I find myself waiting with bated breath for January.  An this from a person who has never watched a soap opera.
B00DQVKGOU|5.0|Previous to this book, I had never read any of the original Sherlock Holmes. It was easy to read despite being written almost 100 years ago, and even easier to finish. It's easy to see why there have been so many remakes and rip offs. Highly enjoyable.
B00386F0DA|5.0|Great value; 3 DVDs for the price of 1.  My sister had been asking for Kate & Leopold; I couldn't find it in the stores but found it cheaper on Amazon.com so I had it shipped directly to her.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|Decent movie, still waiting for the next season of the actual show. Although the extras were pretty decent for the most part.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is totally fun for all ages<br /> I love it and my brother and sister love it to<br /><br />I recommend you to get ice age village
0345529057|5.0|I love this saga of books.  I especially like George RR Martin s style of writing.  I couldn't stop reading once I started.  Beautifully written and contains more than the HBO series can ever get in an hour.
B008469DGY|4.0|While you do not play a actual round of golf,the action here is playing a golf shot that you can control after you hit the ball. Can't do that in regular golf. This game is fun and somewhat challenging . AND.....you can get holes in one if you try hard enough.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This CD is great, young country singer that I'm sure that will get a brilliant future !...good purchase for any fan of country music
0143038583|5.0|This is the short review I wrote for my class.<br />1. What is the \\"Big Idea\\" of this book?<br /><br />There are a few big ideas, but what I found most prevelant was the quote on the last page of the book. \\"Let us stipulate that both of these meals are equally unreal and equally unsustainable. Which is perhaps why we hsould do what a responisble social scientist would do under the circumstances: discard them both as anomalies or outliers-outliers of a real life. Or better yet, preserve them but purely as ritual, for the lessons they have to teach us about the different uses to which the world can be put.\\" Pg 411.<br /><br />I saw this book first as a rally to eat only from farmers markets, real food, foraging, etc... However, Michael Pollan states in the previous quote that it can't always be done. In a world in which everything is needed at a moments notice, one can not eat a perfect traditional diet every day of the year. I believe Pollan wanted to take the reader through the journey of how food should look. He wanted to shock the reader into understanding that what he or she puts in his or her body matters. He succeeds.<br /><br />2. List three things you learned about nutrition from this book.<br /><br />a. I learned about a true and successful farm, Polyface. I have little knowledge prior of how a proper farm should be run. Pollan gave such great examples of how each animal on the farm needed one another. That the cows needed proper grass, the chickens needed to graze through after the cows to eat and spread the manuer, etc... Although it may not be exact nutrition, that is definitely something that has stuck with me<br /><br />b. I learned a LOT about corn!! Phew. Such as the enzyme hydrolysis which revolutionized corn refining in the 1940's As enzymes replaced acids, refiners were able to produce proressively sweeter sweeteners from corn.<br /><br />c. Foraging. It never really occured to me that I could go and hunt for mushrooms or other produce. I loved reading about when and where Pollan found his mushrooms. It was great advice to look for your real foods in your own back yard.<br /><br />4. What are your thoughts/comments/perspectives about this book?<br /><br />Loved it!! This book gave great insight to so many aspects to our food culture. During my first couple hours of reading I wasn't sure if I would love the book. Especially when he began to get political. :) BUT Pollan gave a great realization to food and what it means to eat natural whole foods from restainable sources. I would highly recommend this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great for the entire family. My daughter and I can't get enough of it. We play together and see who gets the better score
B004JN1D2I|5.0|It was up and down journey.  Some characters were more interesting but all had a story to tell. Parts made me react out loud with surprise, cheer, or laughter.  That makes for good reading
B00CJGP116|5.0|I love every single song on this album. It's refreshing to hear such a beautiful voice, lyrics and orchestra. What a great artist and talent!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love this series! You can really get into the story. Though some parts might seem drawn out or boring, each encounter/place/person has a purpose that ties the whole thing together! I can't wait to read a Dance with Dragons and see next season of a Game of Thrones.
B005ZC0SYQ|4.0|Sublime in it's use of life and death metaphore, The Crow gets four CAWs from this reviewer. Enjoy it anytime, on the fly.
B007HJ9LXE|3.0|Book was better! The movie touched on the highlights of Fridas life in the book. Salam Hayek, of course, who is beautiful did a great job acting as the arrogant, fiesty but funny Frida. The movie was definitely a downer. I recommend reading the book first then watch the movie.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Good in general :<br />* Weather option should be free !<br />* More Clock appearance options required.<br />* Easy to use with considerable useful features.
193700788X|5.0|There are no words to describe the book. Thrilling, emotional, addictive and unpredictable! You make your plan to read one chapter before bed and you end up reading 5 and actually resenting the fact that you have somewhere to be the following morning, otherwise, you would carry on and read the whole thing!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|The movie is about love and relationships, and takes place in U.K.  It is a good add to my romance collection. It arrived fast.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love this movie when I first saw it.  I like the plot, characters, the comedy, the up tight Queen, her bad triplet brothers, her bumbling suitors, her big strong ego driven father.  I think Disney and Pixar collaborated to make it.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|Singin in the Rain is an old classic, well played and delightfully produced.  Debbie Reynolds is always a delight to watch.  She is charming, with a beautiful voice . And along with Gene Kelly and Donald Oconnor it makes for a very pleasant evening of enjoyment.  The animated scene with the mouse dancing with Gene Kelly is an extra little bit of humor that adds to the delight if the movie.  Excellent acting, singing and just plain nice story.
B0009A40ES|3.0|I read American Psycho as a kid, hiding it under my pillows from my super religious father. Everyone ranted and raved about how good this film was, but I was shocked at how tame it was. That book terrified me and the ending was so startling. But in the film it was so watered down. Even the horror scenes they did show were mild and easy to swallow. But, more than anything else I was disappointed in how brief the ending was. There was not emphasis drawn to the fact that Patrick Bateman was a loser who created this world in his head, a world where he could take his aggression out on the people who would not deal with his petty view of the world. I felt like the end of the film could have been a little more dramatic. It left me feeling like I was missing something.<br /><br />Aside from the above, it was a fun film to watch. Christian Bale is a pretty good Patrick. Nice and always looking overwhelmed.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|It was okay. Really cheesy story line though. Definitely &#34;watchable&#34;... I think I would have been disappointed if I saw in a move theatre.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love this game. Looked for a good Mahjong game for a long time &amp; have finally one. Never had any problems with this app whatsoever &amp; that's rare.
B0000A2I1B|3.0|Atmospheric.  This is the best description I can find for 'Caravanserai'.  It is a time and place Album.<br />I love Santana which is why I bought this CD, but, the main problem for me is that in parts it is a little too experimental<br />Right time, right place, great music.<br />But! You really need the time and place.<br />It's Friday afternoon.  Not the right time or place.
B000008HPE|5.0|This is truly the best of Huey Lews and his band.<br />I just wish they woud come back and make more big hits!!
1451695195|3.0|Skipped through some of the book as I lost interest in some of the personal information.  There are parts of the book that I concur with and others that I can't fathom.  The book was just okay.
B00B5QGPZC|5.0|This is David's greatest work up to date. I really enjoy it and listen to it often. I would recommend you buy this DVD.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Excellent choice for collection very recommended for all ages  and a good option for a movie weekend at home, nice
B00008977N|5.0|Per my taste, only Phil Collins &#34;First Final...&#34; and Pink Floyd Pulse are on the same level....superior quality with sound set-up!
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|this just makes everything more complicated than it needs to be. To start you have to go through two screens before you get to your 'note.' Which i have been using to take class notes. Second you have to make a text box to type, and if your text runs beyond the viewable text box you have to scroll down to get to where you left off and you have to do that outside of the text box. Third and this is the huge annoyance if you want to go back to change anything the cursor will go there but it might insert what you're typing where you last were and you have to monkey with it or just delete a sentence to get back to that one word. InkPad Notepad is much simpler to operate download that instead and don't bother with this.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|LOVE this game ... BUT ... it's expensive and glitchy. I was at Level 29 and lost my place and had to start over again. There IS something about raising dragons tho' which is VERY addicting ... so if you know going in what to expect, you'll enjoy playing this game.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|the mystery and suspense is spellbinding and keeps you interested throughout the whole book..leecild is a master author and knows how to keep  you interested throughout the whole book.
B002KEDQJQ|5.0|Visually amazing adaptation of the graphic novel! Characters are a lot of fun, movie subject is more for adults even though is is adapted from a comic/ graphic novel
B00B51A5PS|5.0|I put this on my Kindle. There is some controversy about the accuracy of the various translations, but for a buck, I think I gained a good understanding of Adolph Hitler in prison.  I am a student of history, and fools around me made rude remarks regarding my reading this book. Ignore the stupid masses and read it with a mind to understanding Hitler's world view.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Grids from 5x5 to 15x15 and helps count against your score. I tried the free version and was satisfied with it for a long time. Eventually I had to admit I was hooked and forked over for this paid version. FWIW Amazon's price is lower than the Samsung App Store.<br /><br />Gaming will be easier if you use a stylus such as the iKross Fiber Style Touch Screen Stylus.<br /><br />Plays on a Samsung Google Tab 2
0375869026|5.0|I finished this book in record time because I could not put it down.  It gripped my heart and mind right out of the gate.  I shared August's fears, pain, joys and sorrows, as well as those of his parents, sister, friends and tormentors.  Ms. Palacio writes in a way that just puts you there and makes you *feel* what transpires between the covers.<br /><br />The narratives are written from Auggie's perspective, as well as his sister's and several friends and acquaintances.  These short essays, each with a whimsical title, are written rather simplistically and from pre-teen and teen viewpoints, yet the observations within them are ripe with the complexities in Auggie's life and those of the people in his circle.  I particularly admire the way Ms. Palacio weaves these ponderings together with letters, notes, bits of poetry and pop songs, Facebook texts and \\"Mr. Browne's precepts.\\"<br /><br />I hesitate to call this book an \\"easy read.\\"  The mind receives the words easily, but the heart may falter upon absorbing them.  Be prepared to weep, empathize painfully, giggle and cheer.  Bravo, R.J. Palacio - well done.
B008NR91DO|5.0|I'm a longtime Hendrix fan but put off buying this concert because I wasn't familiar with Gary Moore. Then I saw Moore perform &#34;Red House&#34; on &#34;The Strat Pack&#34; DVD and that was enough to convince me I had to have this concert. (The &#34;Strat Pack&#34; DVD is apparently no longer available for Region 1.)<br /><br />Likes: Video is sharp and clear and without special effects, the sound is well balanced and of consistent volume. Moore's ability to play &#34;Hendrix style&#34; is phenominal!  When Mitchell and Cox join Moore for the last few songs and the chemistry between them is fantastic. In fact they enable Moore to stretch to a higher level of playing.<br /><br />Dislikes: The concert was too short. The Band of Gypsys appear only on the last few songs, not that Moore's band is bad but there should have been two whole concerts- one with each band.<br /><br />This DVD has motivated me to search for Moore's other works and to revisit other artists covering Hendrix's material.
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|This movie has everything. Action, romance, intrigue, more explosions than you know what to do with - AND it's FUNNY! And the blu-ray is great. If you're a fan of action movies, go see this. Now.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book.  Couldn't put it down.  Interesting concept and Stephen KIng is a great author.  Finally a book that makes me think!
B00B8ED7OS|5.0|If I hadn't noticed the page number at the bottom of the last page I would have thought I just read a short story.  This book flowed perfectly and it is a fast read for a near 300 page book.  I couldn't put it down once I started.  Julian and Siris are strong characters that pull you into their lives.  The good, the bad, and the in between; you get to feel all they feel.  What a great story and tremendous writing.  I can't wait for the next book.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|Perhaps the best series since the Sopranos.  Great story line, believable characters.  The remaining seasons are equally as well done,
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie keeps you guessing until the end. Full of great magic and wonderful acting.<br />This is a definite must see.
B002ELIXCA|5.0|Love it.  Great writing, great chemistry between ALL of the characters.  Great storyline.  I will miss this show went it ends in September 2013.  Was a great run!
B004X80QNG|2.0|When I look at products, apps to purchase or try out I look at the star ratings. I try to use a 10-1 ratio of 5 star vs. 1 star ratings. In this case you actually have more 1 star reviews then 5 star ones. That is an absolute stop sign even if it is free. For those who state the latest update made it stop working correctly you may if you wish go into your settings and remove the last update and it probably will work like before. That is what I did with the update earlier this year in YouTube to fix the full screen problem (it later got resolved with another update). For those who say \\"don't listen to those who complain\\" I can only say that more people are unhappy with the product then those who praise it. A 3 star average is horrid no matter the product. That is just the way it is. Good luck.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I love British dramas. This one is well written and well acted. I can't wait for the next episode. I hope season two is in the works.
B00A27X972|5.0|The transformation of the alien's personality reminded me Joseph Campbell's The Hero's Journey. His perceptions of us humans are both funny and right on. And as a dog lover, that part was an added bonus.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Best youtube downloader out there. Have been using it since a few years now. Absolutely the best.<br />Multiple file quality dowbload options so no unnecessary damage to your data plan
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Great movie that does a great book justice! Very well done. I love the book so I was surprised how much I liked the movie!
B004T32SOK|5.0|easy to use with simple windows and mac integration; also using with iPhone and Kindle HD. and finally my  50 GB Box storage is awesome.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Can't get enough and this option of watching is amazingly fast and easy to use. Highly recommend for anyone that misses and episode :)
0061950726|5.0|I didn't much like Molly at first.  Her life paled to that of Vivian.  But as the book moved on and I got to know both of them, I came to love both of them.  The characters became people and their lives real.  Molly's misconceptions about Vivian were wonderfully deflated.  I loved the ending, oh, I really did.  And I hated for it to stop.  Molly is a wonderful person, and Vivian helped her to realize it.
B002BEXENS|5.0|WHAT A UNDERSTATEMENT.  SUPER-SUPER SESSION. BLEW ME AWAY THEN, BLOWS ME AWAY NOW.CLASSIC,LEGENDS,MUSICIANS,JAMMIN,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL TRUE MUSIC LOVERS FROM YESTERDAY.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best movie experiences I have ever had (and I've had a lot).  It's engrossing.  It's violent but in an eerily human way.  Everyone who likes movies should see these.
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|SUCH AN ANIMAL.FOR THE ERIC FANS.BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. EVER CHANGING , YET, TRUE TO HIS MUSIC.KEEP ROCKIN, ERIC.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The best bingo game out there, hands down! Thanks for making sure I can play this on all my devices...
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I love this show. The characters are well cast and there is just enough mystery and comedy to make it a pleasure to watch. It is like the X files from years ago where you just want to keep knowing more.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Imaginative! Thought provoking with lots to think about. I'm looking forward to the next book, hopefully due out sooner rather than later.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Does its job.  No complaints.  (I need to add 15 more words?  Why?  I said all I needed to say already.)
B0017KIBAI|5.0|A great nintendo product that is very reliable. The long 9ft cord makes it easier too. I reccomend this product.
B000H6SXMY|2.0|Love the show was very excited until after every few disks there is always one that is scratched. Don't buy. Unless you are willing to miss a lot of episodes.
B001AQO41E|5.0|As the story goes Spielberg was working on another film (Raiders or E.T.) and according to the studio system rules of the time a director could only work on one film at a time. Spielberg let Hooper take the credit as director but seriously, if you've seen this movie then you know that it's a Spielberg film all the way. It's every bit as good as Raiders, E.T. Jaws and Close Encounters.<br />A friend of mine worked on Jurassic Park as a PA and got a lot of inside scuttle and one of the discussions was about Poltergeist and an inside long term Spielberg production crew member confirmed that this was a Steven Spielberg film in all but name.<br />And as far as I'm concerned it's a must buy for any Spielberg fan especially if you love his first 5-6 films more than any of the others.<br />And this Blu-ray looks magnificent. I've always loved this movie and the digibook is a great way to have this on the shelf, the other thing is just how wonderful and new the image is. I'm just waiting for 1941 and The Sugarland Express to be released on Blu-ray and the very best Spielberg films will all be out. Sugarland Express, 1941, Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Poltergeist and E.T. I count as his all time best films.
B00E7SID9G|5.0|People get so cought up in the arguments of religious leaders who's only knowledge is reading the Bible throught the colored glasses of their own beliefs.<br />This cuts through the mythology and is an actual historians reconstruction of the times, people, and political realities of the time in which the Nazarene lived,and died.<br />Yes it will tread on charished myths, simply because they are wrong. But this is in no way a debunking by an angery individual. Aslan cares enough to bravely expose the real Jesus. 20 years of careful research went into this scholors work.<br />If you are a believer, best to know who you believe in. And why.
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|John Carpenter is not one of my favorite directors but he is beginning to be, I've always enjoyed his films but never really stopped to consider them that much unlike Steven Spielberg who was always a shining star but upon deeper inspection Carpenter nearly rivals Spielberg in his early work. What!? You say, am I mad?? Well, consider... if you are a true Spielberg aficionado then you must realize that Spielberg's best films or 'golden era' was of course Jaws, Close Encounters, 1941, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, E.T. and Poltergeist (Yes, Poltergeist was really a Spielberg film and not a Tobey Hooper film, read the real history). And like Spielberg, John Carpenter also has his golden era which includes Halloween, The Fog, Christine, The Thing, Escape From New York, Starman and Big Trouble In Little China.<br />Both were superb directors and both did genre films, and both had a natural lived-in kind of looking style to their filmmaking and the best of both directors films were from the late 1970's to mid 1980's.<br /><br />John Carpenter is highly underrated and so is The Fog, a great original piece of filmmaking and a very almost Hitchcockian thriller not unlike The Birds. Even some of the locations used in The Fog were the same used in Hitchcock's The Birds.<br />It seems that Brian De Palma wasn't the only Hitchcock imitator around... Carpenter's the Fog on Blu-ray looks stunningly new. The picture is crisp and sharp, the colors and tons all look wonderful and best of all the picture hasn't been messed with nor the effects CGI'd ... I really wish Lucasfilm would treat the original Star Wars as well as the Scream Factory seems to be doing with films like The Fog and other old releases. Besides this Blu-ray edition enhancing the viewing pleasure and making me actually fall in love with a film I previously hadn't cared for that much (I always thought The Fog was Carpenter's weakest film) but now I think it's one of his strongest and most innovative. This is an excellent Blu-ray in both quality and special features. There are two commentary tracks and a tour of the locations which I found to be just as interesting (if not more) than watching the film itself.<br />I highly recommend this edition of The Fog, if you are a John Carpenter fan it's essential or if you are a fan of this era of filmmaking like I am and want to see old films you remember from growing up look new again this is a must buy.<br />I want to round out my John Carpenter Collection and I currently own Halloween, The Fog, The Thing, Starman and Big Trouble In Little China on Blu-ray ... all I need is Christine and Escape From New York to finish the set. Christine is SO expensive being a limited edition from Twilight Time and going for something like $80-100 or more but I hear it looks fantastic. I own a copy of the Twilight Time Blue Lagoon on Blu-ray and it is so gorgeous with all the natural world elements like ocean, beach and jungle as the backdrop for the story and I highly recommend it!<br />I would so love to get my hands on Christine. The only prob with Escape from NY is that they went the cheap route, there are no special features on the movie so I'll also be keeping my DVD special edition with it. I did the same for The Thing on Blu-ray, I just took an empty Blu-ray case for 3 discs and took out the paper cover from single The Thing BD and put it in the new BD case then added the 2 discs of the DVD and combined them into one set. If any Blu-rays do not have all the same features or any from the last DVD release I simply combine sets in one BD case that can hold 2-3 discs. Looks like I'll be doing the same for Escape From NY!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|this game is upsetting.  i bought 165 coins &amp; DID NOT get them!  Plus when I get bingo towards the end of the game I lose it. So I am deleting this game.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|I bought this movie sight unseen because I like Banderas and Elena Anaya, neither one disappoints. Anaya is pretty much the perfect woman physically (I've never met her) and Banderas is handsome of course and has an intensity about his acting that transcends nationalities. This was a tighter, more stylish film than I thought it would be.<br />At first I dismissed it as another Human Centipede kind of movie but it is far far better than that. A sleek, sophisticated, stylish thriller.<br />Sure there's a lot of violence and nudity and shocking moments but it's also a very cool movie and I had no problems watching the characters interact or understanding their intentions.<br />The director/writer is brilliant and never mind what anyone says about the film being disturbing because it's genius and one of the most original thrillers I've seen in a long long time.<br />I would equate this more with David Cronenberg's The Fly and Dead Ringers (two films I love) than with anything else. It's main theme of transformation and experimentation resides within both of those films as well, I just wonder what Vera's life would be like after the credits roll. It would be great to see a sequel to this or even a trilogy like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo which is another disturbingly-beautiful film I would equate this with, but only if the director remained and only if Elena Anaya would continue her role and if the standards of quality both in directing and in writing would not diminish....
B00A285OOW|5.0|Love Phillipa Gregory' s writing style.  I felt like I knew the characters and was present. If you have read her other books, this one won't disappoint.
B003MX6QPU|4.0|Very cute movie.  Great music. Actors had fantastic chemistry which made the movie!  I would recommend to a friend , really
B0044FEZBM|5.0|This is not really a review. There is nothing to review. This is a great buy. It is more of a message towards the visual arts companies, theaters, ballet companies and maybe Ivan Vasiliev himself. Ladies and gentlemen, do you realise that this Ivan Vasiliev guy  is ARGUABLY THE GREATEST DANCER we have seen since the times of Nureyev and Barishnikov?????? I watched him on You Tube on the advice of a friend and I said to myself \\"What the hell is this???\\". I was speechless. And then I decided to enter the Amazon site and buy everything that there is on him and with him. AND I FIND JUST THIS!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS??? Give this guy and us a SPARTACUS, a CORSAIRE, a DON QUICHOTE, a LA BAYADERE. AND FILM HIM FOR GOODNESS' SAKE! ON BLU RAY! I hope you realise your responsibilities towards the public and the art of ballet itself. If other ballet fans agree with me then please make yourselves heard and put pressure on these people.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read all five books straight through and when I wasn't reading I was thinking about this story.  I couldn't put this down.  Hugh Howey I will forever be a fan. Looking forward to reading from this authors work.  Read Wool you wont be disappointed.  A steal of a deal too!  What more could you want ....?...THE MOVIE.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|only thing missing was more slowmo scenes!! I watched this movie for the first time with my girlfriend and even she loved it (although she loves action movies in general)
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|not enough rooms would enjoy more,  but did involve some thinking to open the doors. Can't wait for more. Thanks Mobest Media! !
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good cry at the end! Beautifully written, I did learn a few new words. I couldn't put it down at the end. A must read!
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Pretty well written and well acted.  Story a bit implausible, but held my attention for the most part.  Liked Matthew in a Time to Kill much better.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|When I first heard of this show and its premise, I was thinking, &#34;O boy! Another goofy show like 'Lost in Space.'&#34; I was so wrong! This is a wonderful show!! I love Janeway and all the other strong women (even Seska) and how everyone works so hard together to get home. It's nice to see a female captain for a change. If the future is as bright as Roddenberry painted, then being Captain would not depend on gender or race. I would recommend this show to any non-Trekker. It's got great messages and wonderful action.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Time flies when playing this game.  very challenging. Grandchildren cant put it down. The way you earn points is fun. Highly recommend.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Bakersfield is a masterful recording by two gifted artists of several Buck and Merle favorites. Although they are covers, this collection of songs is beautifully interpreted in a creative way. None of the overdone drinkin' songs here. Instead, there are songs that relate to the human experience in a traditional country format with great lyrics and melodies. Now, if only non-profit fire companies, who seem to be the only entities that teach country dancing these days, could use this CD without paying an arm and a leg in royalties, maybe traditional quality danceable country music might make a comeback!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I so want to read the next book. 💭Thinking about reading the other one😛. 💖Love this forever!!!💖 A must read
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|My Brony and I saw this in the theatre this summer. Great movie for adults and kids. Buy the Equestria girls dolls too!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I have watched this movie about four times within the last two months.  It is a really good movie, all the more so because it is based on fact.  And the acting is quite good, as well.  Any history buffs out there?  This is a movie for you.
0316247545|5.0|All the facts you need about My Little Pony. Spoilers if you haven't seen all of the episodes. Beautiful cover & great pictures inside. Kids who can read will enjoy learning more about MLP & your Brony will love having the voice actors write personal messages in it.
B00AAQVSDW|4.0|good album overall, definitely a little country with a little twang... enjoy the music, would recommend buying this album for the country listeners.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I have seen this movie three times, and love it.  I love the British actors and find the movie mimics life for a lot of our seniors.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Got to love it, he is one of my favorite artist which all started when he played with Hootie and the Blowfish.....enjoy his deep southern voice and catchy music.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautiful writing.  Poignant story that grabs the reader throughout the book.  Loved Hosseini's past books as well.  Read it in three days and have to read it again.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|one of my favorite movies, the family and I could watch this a million times and probably have, easy to walk away quoting the movie and the loveable characters...
B001AGXEAG|5.0|on time and in good work good and i will like more to see like that think you very much
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Installed this to remedy the fact that I can no longer watch YouTube vids on my fire. Unfortunately they still wouldn't play after installing this and then I got a virus found message that prompted me to click on something and screen would not respond. I am guessing if I did click on it something bad may have happened but instead I removed this app from my fire. Will keep looking.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|The love story made no sense but everything else was really cool. The story line was good and the ending was a bit of a surprise but also didn't make much sense, as if the love story was just tossed in as an afterthought.
1885167776|5.0|This is the oone book I highly recommend for everyone to read.  Great great informations, the book is well organized. Love the book
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|Frustrating. Only works in horizontal view and NOT user friendly.., the generic kindle mail app is a trillion times better.
B009EHDU7U|1.0|This book was so far fetched it was ridiculous, no entraining at all. It was a very basic style of writing and I think that was what made it boring rather than just simplistic.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|This app is amazing. I love the different modes and all of the achievements that make you just that much more addicted. I strongly suggest buying this app.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I have no reason to doubt Dr. Alexander had an afterlife experience.  His terms for the &#34;areas&#34; he visited sound story-like rather than real.  I am wondering why he never mentions seeing Jesus.  I wouldn't recommend this book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett doesn't write a book every year, but his books are worth waiting for. I can't wait for the third book on this trilogy.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|So much of this book resonated with what I've known intuitively my entire life, though I must say it was after Dr. Alexander woke up that the book seemed to really move and that was of most interest to me.  Extremely inspiring and motivational as well, in its own way.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|After my 25 years of reading these books, I am truly sad it is over and thrilled over a great ending for Rand and his Wheel of Time characters!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|We are really enjoying playing it and we are only on the first few levels. There are a lot of levels so it is not a game you will be done playing in after a short time.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We sat down and enjoyed this together while visiting our grandchildren over dinner we all laughed and liked this cartoon movie a lot. Thanks for having this available on &#34;Amazon videos&#34;.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|A war movie based on the winners side.  Somewhat more a legend than reality.  A story of perseverance in the face of adversity.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I would recommend this game to everyone I know :)<br />I wish you didn't have to buy the  tokens .
B000VK99Z6|3.0|It had a few moments, it was well enough told, actors were good, but I just didn't find it fun or funny. A bit dull.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|My Review of the Avengers<br />Great graphics, attitude, comments, story lines, and lotsa  surprises! The characters were more like the comics they came from than I thought possible.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I just love Star Trek and I think they've done a fantastic job bringing forward! I think I love the villain's angst in the first movie, but this movie keeps us going. I just can't wait for another--more--more!
B000WMFZMY|3.0|The story was about a real person, but I was disapointed in the movies lack relationship to the social sttuation in Spain at time. The scenes and color were excellent and peformances were what we've come to expect frm the featued actors.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love everything about this game.It is so addicting! I could play for Hours on end..and I do!!Definably  worth you giving it a try!!So what are you waiting for????
6305364648|4.0|A unique plot. Very refreshing in todays mess of remaks, films fom videogames, and other gimmcks. This movie successfully combines action and humor in original presentations.
B007TBZ63Y|1.0|The author did a very good job on the story line and description although I wanted it to be the last book. Now I have to buy the House of Hades. All in all, a book leaving you wanting more.
B005LAIGNC|3.0|I must admit I was somewhat disappointed in this movie.Having seen (and own) the orginal TV movie, &#34;TheTuskeege Aiman), I found Red Tails lackluster and I had difficulty keeping my attntion on the movie.Perhaps it would be a more effective for someone who is not familir with the group.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I tried this,on a lark. Lo and behold, I,m hooked. This is addictive. I enjoy being able to choose different degrees of difficulty. Highly recommend.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|Pretty good game for a buck. Some people act like they spent 6 or 8. It works really well and one I get used to the sensitive steering I will master this puppy.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book starts off kind of young but definitely take a turn for the dark. Great read for adults too!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|This is my abortive book by Jane Austen.  Great read and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Jane austen
B008P1EWIM|5.0|If you want to know what type of weather conditions to be ready for before you go out get this application.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Refreshing, delightful and easy to read book of great clarity. Written without any 'mumbo jumbo', proves it's absolutely true that we can control our own destiny with great precision if we decide to suspend our disbelief and trust it.
0385341008|5.0|A peek back in time offering tidbits of information regarding a time not in the too distant past. Well worth the read.
B004GFN11A|5.0|great
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|I dont read often but I loved it too much that I couldn't put it down. It's a must read!!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Great price .. no Flaws ... Can't go wrong with Amazon .....
B0097EWK3A|5.0|first game like this ive played. it has a good story line, suspensful, and before ya know it, 2 hrs have passed. it keeps your mind working and not too easy. i like a game that makes ne think a little.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|Great price .. no Flaws ... Can't go wrong with Amazon .....
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A friend had read all of the Reacher books, and since I'm a fan of John Sanford and Sue Grafton, I thought I'd give these a try. I guess you'd have to be a Mack Bolan/Dirk Pitts fan to really appreciate the story, but to me, Reacher is too unbelievable for me to enjoy the book. A reasonable plot, but populated by not-so-real characters, and a few last minute saves. Fortunately, it was a fast read. I'm struggling through the 2nd Reacher book, and it will probably be my last.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great price .. no Flaws ... Can't go wrong with Amazon .....
0321934318|5.0|Well written and structured in an easy to understand and learn way.  Good examples that makes it easy to follow.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius Rucker is my new favorite singer, Great album.
B00BP0MJ08|5.0|This one of the best book I have read on science, and the best to explain to my 12-year old daughter. My daughter is not too much into science, but with this book she has taken interest and ask lots of questions. It has to be the hardcover as it has great illustrations that helps my daughter to be interested. I guess the paperback version doesn’t have the illustrations
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A must read for all, especially those who don't believe in after life.  The book was suggested to me by someone who has no faith.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Suits is a classic series with fantastic writing, with an outstanding group of actors that really know what they are doing.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|This game is okay, and definitely a challenge to play. Not very easy at some points, and I needed to Google cheats to get pass most levels.
B0041X90D0|5.0|If you enjoyed Electric Warrior you will, in all likelihood, enjoy this as well. A little more up tempo, but just as good.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This a very fun game to play. Similar to Tetris, it is very easy to play and the instructions are clear and easy to follow. With different settings to choose from, you can just relax and play or challenge yourself.
B000002KNI|5.0|...you can imagine people there in Central park...they were a great duo. This concert is timeless and for every age and type.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|This game is okay. Not that fun to play, and to unlock any thing more than the basic characters and colors, you have to pay money.
B002XZNHG4|5.0|I love the Woody from the seventies. Witty and funny. A really true true classic not to miss, like Manhattan!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This game is a lot of fun to play, and has fun puzzles that are not to challenging to complete. I don't feel that it is worth paying two dollars (I got it as the free app of the day), and I am currently stuck on a level and I have no way to pass.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|TOTALLY worth the  99 cents. The best racing game on kindle fire by far imho.<br />Online racing is also very fun as they class you with similar skilled drivers.
B00CDY6HW6|2.0|This game was very confusing to me. There are no clear instructions to it and it isn't worth the price they ask. I got it as the free app of the day.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|still playing with it.<br />works well on both HTC One and Nexus 7<br />like the voice to text on all things and this one is good!<br />color pages help me sort quickly.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Being a huge fan of the weird I love this show. Highly reccomend the show to anyone who likes strange and crazy shows best show I have seen so far.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|WATCH IT ALL TIME SENT GIFTS TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY<br />CAN NOT STOP WATCHING SHOWS ARE SO GREAT<br />RIVOTING ACTION NEW SUPER HEROS.<br />  BETTER THAN SUPER AND IRON AND BAT MAN HEROS<br />BUT I STILL LKVE WOLVERINE LOGAN BEST
159514188X|5.0|Really nicely written book. It surprised me how good it was. Its a very interesting  concept would recommend to anyone.
0547848412|5.0|WAS ASKED TO READ BY A PASTOR AND WATCH MOVIE TO COMPARE RELIGIOUS IDEAS<br />I WAS SURPRISED BY ENDING THOUGH WAS A LITTLE SHOCKED I THINK
B0063IH60K|5.0|I agree with other customers.  Love the game, hate the pop-up ads.  Very irritating.  Had to uninstall once, screen was black, game screen wouldn't show.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|the album is wonderful and off the chart, but i like to have copies for my vehicles, and something is on the disc to prevent it from having good quality.  i slowed the speed all the way down on my 3 burners, and it still skipped in spots, so i will just wear out the original disc.
B00AHG9KYE|5.0|What can I say, a good read and entertaining, yes. But then Arthur C Clark is a great sifi writer factual and thought prevoking.
B004X80QNG|4.0|Looks just like the screen shots...on a tablet. I'm guessing on a phone it's different because Android apps can use different screens based on device resolution. This is why you don't need &quot;phone apps&quot; and &quot;tablet apps&quot; like in the iOS (Apple) world.<br />Why did I give it 4 stars. Well, it doesn't destroy properly, so if you do a lot of movement within the app you can back out through every movement. In other words, continued use can eat up memory. Otherwise it's decent.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|A well written, well researched novel. Believable, exciting, enjoyable and wonderful entertainment. Descriptive writing puts you right there where it's all happening!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is a mixture of my favorite things. Monkeys, balloons, and pure awesome! You get to build, upgrade, plan, and pop in this awesome game.<br />Very appropriate.<br />Never Gets boring!<br />Get it now!
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This is a very good movie. It's a bit of a tear-jerker; it's a movie about a person finding who he is, showing others who he is & coming to peace with his life. It's definitely worth seeing.
B008JFUP8A|5.0|I loved the movie.  I recommend that any father that feels he has lost communication with his son watch the movie with him and discuss it afterwards.  You may find out something new about each other.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I did not know if I would like this game.I am  always looking for a good puzzle game and now I have found another
