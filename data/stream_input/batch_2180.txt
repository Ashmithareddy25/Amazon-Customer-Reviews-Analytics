B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I try to stay away from Nicholas Sparks books because it seems like they are all the same. I haven't read his books in about 5 years and when I saw this was a movie coming out I just had to read the book. I'm sure glad I did! I didn't want to put it down and was sad when it ended. This keeps you wanting to read more and the ending gave me goose bumps. This is a must read, Can't wait to go watch the movie now :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. it seems really good so far. Easy to use and understand. A lot of different horses you can earn.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Just enough of action with a good plot.  Did not over burden the movie.  Jeremy Renner is  hunk. Good job.
B00000DCHI|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with this CD.  I had a double CD and it was lost in international shipping when I returned to the U.S. from living in England.  I thought this was the CD but this one is a much earlier version.
B005HEPJBY|5.0|It's a great season and wonderful seeing the episodes commercial free. Makes one more cognizant of what being &#34;human&#34; entails and also poses interesting points to ponder.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game. Good graphics, great game play and super challenging.  Hard to put down! Out plays Temple Run by far, bravo.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Kudos also to Ben Afflect for his direction and acting in this one!! I loved this film from beginning to end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like it alot.  It is handy and works well when I need it.  It was easy to download. Thanks!
B00000ADG2|5.0|What can I say about this artist and her CD? I think if you ever like just a song from this artist, then you should definitely look into obtaining this CD for your ears pleasure :D
B005WUHAX8|3.0|Not easy to use side switches on the side  of the  phone  and hard to attach  cable wire and earphones
B004C3DLJS|5.0|so cute and funny even adults will enjoy this movie! lots of laughs, will entertain a child of any age.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just got hooked on Downton Abbey this season so had to catch up.  Great season! Even better than Season 1.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Clint Eastwood at his best, just when you think he couldn't be any better. He plays this role well. An old school man refusing to leave his culturally diverse neighborhood and in the end, you can't help but understand both sides of this racially packed drama.
B0050R0XEG|4.0|This has been my first major Lego set in years; after growing up with the late 80s models that Lego has, I was eager for a challenge.  Plus my mom loves it after seeing it.  It took about 6 hours over two days to build, the length of time mostly just to enjoy the little details that the designers put into it.  From the kitchen sink to the drawers to the cabinets, even the lava lamp and plant in the back, this was a fun model to build and you can tell the designers had fun with it.<br /><br />Like many others, I am disappointed primarily with the roof.  There's only so many points for it to be connected to the frame, and you worry about it actually being on.  The roof you can divide into three parts: the bike rack, the extendable roof, and the cabin roof.  The bike rack and extendable roof connect well together; the cabin roof is probably the worst for connectivity.  It will be two pieces I order separately from lego.com just to strengthen it up a bit.<br /><br />The bumpers are the last thing I'm disappointed in. They look amazing, but fall apart so easily.  Especially if you are trying to secure a part to the &#34;frame&#34; of the van and press against it by accident.<br /><br />Overall, a good model.  Enough that I'll buy another one and do a color swap out from red to blue, just to have another one.
B0094K1K42|4.0|Although the main character played by Charlize Theron was a &#34;homewrecker&#34; wannabe, she had depth and you felt sorry for her. I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie but it was entertaining.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I am not a first-mover when it comes to technology, so my love of this might be tempered with a sense of time. Some of you might say well, duh! about the cloud player, but having a free digital copy of most of the CD purchases I make from Amazon is too cool. I can listen to those songs on my phone from the cloud player. Wow. Finally a forward-thinking customer service tool that rewards me for my continued patronage. I now buy almost everything on Amazon, not just music.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I fell asleep watching this movie which is not good for a Denzel Washington movie. I was disappointed. He was great in the movie, at least the first hour, after that I was zzzzing
B006LSZECO|1.0|I see from the reviews that a lot of people adored this book... I definitely did not. I've read boring literature. I've read great literature. I've read mediocre literature. This was just awful. From the time I read the first 3 pages to the time I got to page 112 I was bored. I was bored from page 112 to the end. Nothing about this captivated me. Nothing about this make me want to pick it up and read it. I honestly forgot about this book being on my kindle multiple times because it was just so bad. I would sit there thinking, &#34;I need a new book to read&#34; then remember I had just bought this one and hadn't finished it. There was nothing memorable. Nothing charming. Just a bunch of vague memories and nonsense compiled into an attempt at writing a suspense? novel. It honestly was one of the worst books I've ever read and that's saying something since I've been reading everything I could for as long as I could. I finished the 4th Harry Potter in 13 hours straight and it took me months to finish this book. Do not waste your money.
B005FMZWD8|4.0|I have been a long time Invicta supporter. this watch did not disappoint, my only two critiques would be that the second hand constantly runs and it it the sub-dial second hand that functions with the chronograph. This watch is also a bit more delicate than my other Invictas, I had it in my travel watch box and it was jarred enough to jump the 10 of a second sub-dial forward requiring me to reset all the dials manually.
B007IK44CK|5.0|it was really nice my lady likes action and i put it on for her she was totally amped when it went off
B009VA1FN6|5.0|As a reader of mostly biographies I am really enjoying some excellent fiction lately. It was a book that I read before work, lunchtime, night and whenever I was waiting anywhere - just wanted to keep reading.  Loved the way it went from past to present.  The secret was never suspected by me until it was revealed so Kate is right up there with the best of authors.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were worth it. Fifty Shades of Freed was my all time fave!!!! Can't wait for what's to come
B004GJ1XU2|2.0|The music was great, and there are a few humorous parts. However, after some solid character building, the actual plot left me disappointed. I don't recommend it.
1592407889|5.0|Just read last night, this book is a solid account from a rational person.  As a fan of her mother's for many years and even a member of her mom's site, I am glad this book has been published.  It clearly shows the New Age is dead and rotten, that the author's mother is highly irrational, incredibly neurotic (she couldn't even sit through a therapy session that was much needed) and whose integrity is in the trash can, along with all other authors who write about irrationality and glorify it.  Her mother is egotistical and extraordinarily greedy - beyond anything reasonable.  I already knew something was wrong years ago, but this book is like taking the antidote to the absurd notions of anyone considering taking Shirley or her claims seriously - a wonderful book by a level-headed person.  Thank you so much Sachi, I have great respect for you.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The writing was great and descriptive.  I love it when book can make you visualize the surroundings, especially liked the photos included.
B000PY6BBI|4.0|I've seen this movie numerous times and thoroughly enjoy it for its lightness and story. Matthew Broderick is so funny!
B003K1EYM6|1.0|My SD card would not fit in the reader; even though it is a standard size that fits with all other SD readers I've tried so far.  Have to send it back.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|absolutely love this album.  I am definitely a Beth Hart fan and this album I cannot stop listening to.  Has a very jazz blues feeling to it like you are in an old school Blues pin up rocker Club  and you don't want to leave.  on this album she teams up with  Joe Bonomassa so you get some amazing bass/guitar playing  along with his vocals in many of the songs.  perfect combination!!!  all the songs are very catchy.  I just can't say enough good stuff about this girl.  all her music is great and this album don't explain  just proves once again her brilliance.  Love it!!!  now if I could just see her in concert  : )
B007SGM084|5.0|Love It, not as bad as I thought it would be.  I would recommend to my friends and family to read.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I absolutely love to play this on my kindle.. Just can't put it down. My husband, granddaughter and grandson love it too!!!
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|I missed the last season of 24 and watched it online under prime on my iPad. The show is great as I expected. The video stream was good quality.
B009FZFONO|5.0|i would recommend this to all my friends.<br />very convenient access to the 3rd season of the best show in years
B006VRLNV6|5.0|I bought the latest L.A. Woman reissue on a whim and am blown away by the clarity and depth of sound of both the original tracks and the bonus material. I'll go years without listening to The Doors since first becoming obsessed with &#34;Riders on the Storm,&#34; which was in heavy rotation on AM radio when I was in 7th grade in the early 70's. The song was one of the first 45's I bought with my own hard earned money, saved from my weekly $.25 allowance and occasional baby-sitting jobs--great money for easy work as long as the kids were past the diaper stage. I owned all of The Doors' studio albums by the time I began high school and devoured everything about the band in the music press of the day--Rolling Stone, Cream, etc.. My obsession waned through the years, and The Doors were one of the bands that didn't make the cut as I replaced LP's with CD's and now MP3's in the digital age, opting for a 2 Cd comp to satisfy my Doors' urge as it crops up from time to time. I had forgotten how great it is to hear this album in its entirety--one that deserves its place (along with The Doors' debut album and &#34;Morrison Hotel&#34;) as an essential album (in uber-nerd parlance) in the canon of rock music. Like all great rock bands, The Doors draw from a variety of musical influences to create something dynamic, exciting, and uniquely their own. Morrison's lyrics are exceptionally ominous, even for him, and complement a primarily blues driven album (obviously prominent in the the title track), with some funk (listen to &#34;The Changeling&#34;), and jazz (never more obvious than in the great piano solo in &#34;Riders on the Storm&#34;) throughout the album. Another hallmark of not only this Doors' album but most of their albums is the influence of classical music-- often heard in Manzarack's keyboards or Krieger's guitar. Furthermore, the best Doors' songs, no matter how hard they rock, have a melodic quality that stays with the listener long after the music has been put backin its sleeve or computer file.  All of the tracks are dynamic with stops and starts, sudden changes in volume, tempo or tone by pros who played together for years. Unlike many albums where the extra tracks are inferior versions of the songs that made the album or songs that just didn't belong on a particular album, the bonus tracks here offer a glimpse into the bands' creative process, often slower or faster paced than the final work or versions of songs that don't have the dynamic variety heard in the final work as each member of the band becomes comfortable enough with the work to put his unique signature on the piece. Jim Morrison is not a poet, but he did write some great lyrics and worked with a band of exceptional musicians that made L.A. Woman a great album.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Really cannot put the product down, always using it from time to time and cannot stop My love for Peter Pan.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I loved the way Patricia Cornwell keeps my mind wondering in her Scarpetta series books. This book was no disappointment and kept me reading and trying to solve the case before the characters do, but then there is yet another twist! Love Dr. Scarlett and Patricia Corrnwell!!
B005HI4LLY|5.0|Have Watched over and over again, huge fan of 80's Slasher films, or films made now a days to be in that period.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I appreciated that the primary relationship that this movie is NOT the romance. It's this great struggle between two people to find each other unbearably frustrating, but forced to deal with each other at work. The relationship that grows between them is hilarious and had me rolling on the ground laughing. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this as movie.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Really cannot put the product down, always using it from time to time and cannot stop My love for Peter Pan.
B00684J49U|5.0|This season of Grey's Anatomy came in brand new condition. it was still in the plastic. it works great. I recommend.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|This movie is such a wonderful product and great entertainment for those wanting to get scared and enjoy a great film.
1400069807|5.0|I received this book as a Goodreads giveaway. I thought this book was amazing! I consider myself to be a fairly healthy eater. I like fruits and vegetables and try to stay away from too much processed food. However, after reading this book I have even more of a commitment from staying away from any food that was developed in a laboratory. The author is not preachy. He is not advocating for a certain diet. I have been turned off by other authors such as Michael Pollan who seem to be pushing eating rules on people that are not practical. Instead, Moss has set himself the task of investigating how the processed food giants, including Kraft, Kellog's and others, have relied on the three pillars of Salt, Sugar and Fat to seduce people into eating the maximum amount of processed foods.<br />The author is the journalist who first cracked open the \\"pink slime\\" meat scandal and the depth of his investigative journalism is really impressive. It seems that he has spoken with scores of researchers, marketers and financial officers of the processed food companies in order to learn about things such as the invention of the Lunchable, as a way to sell more processed meats, and the growth of cheese from a food meant to be savored on its own into an ingredient that is shoved into a million different kinds of food.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in nutrition, or in the business of food. I would also recommend it to anyone who is looking for a push to close up the bag of chips or give up a soda habit.

B00364K6YW|5.0|I am unable to watch the new version of this movie with Keira Knightly (beautiful as she is) anymore. This is just incomparable.<br /><br />Rarely have I seen any work on screen that stays this true to its written source. The characterizations and choices of actors are perfect. Mrs. Bennet is so perfect that I was in danger of yelling at the TV because of her nonsense and sensitive &#34;nerves&#34;. Elizabeth was poised, witty, and passionate. And of course, Collin Firth as Mr. Darcy. Sigh. So dashing. It is the role he was meant to play. He does it so so well. And his costumes are the perfect cherry on top.<br />Every character truly is done how they are meant to be.<br /><br />I felt like I was watching the book. Done exactly like it was supposed to be done. Yes, it is long, but you will enjoy every moment of it!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The movie had interesting moments. I think somethings needed to be explained better or really explained at all. Visually it is aesthetically pleasing to the eye.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|The message of the songs are so touching and moving I absolutely love them! &#34;No day but today&#34;, &#34;measure your life in love&#34;, &#34;take me for who I am, who I was meant to be&#34;. I sing RENT all the time. The more I see the film the more I like it. Now I'm in love with all of it. Real. Raw. Touching. An absolutely wonderful musical.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|This movie is full of great humor and subtle and not so subtle messages of wisdom.<br />The quality was great. I will be renting this again.<br />I love this movie.
006197806X|5.0|Lauren Oliver's writing is beautiful. It is indeed poetry.<br /><br />I have read many novels, especially dystopian ones, and the beautiful quality of Oliver's words are really rare these days. Incomparable with many novels out there. She does not merely express the plot, she uses words in her own way and expresses the beauty that writing could have. I hope I'm doing her justice. (keep in mind that this is not the first books of the series).
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I haven't purchased a CD in several years.  After hearing Blue Sky Riders on Leno, I fell in love with the song Feelin' Brave.  I had to pre-order the CD.  I can now say that I love EVERY track on the CD.  The mix of bluegrass/country/pop is amazing.  I can' stand still while I'm listening.  Have to dance and move!  The harmonies these three have are amazing.  Buy this CD and make Blue Sky Riders you new favorite group!!
0062112430|5.0|I read this book because it was recommended to me by Amazon. And I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver's writing is beautiful.

B004SDEP38|1.0|All this does is want you to buy the other one. Says it's free but it really just wants you to buy the other one
B007RFBLDG|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies of all time. Molly Shannon is fearless and goes all out in her role. This is clearly stemming from the genius hilarity that is SNL (Saturday Night Live). Enjoy it!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|Great plot and great characters. I got hooked after a couple of episodes. I really like that there's no cheesy lines or completely absurd heroics.
B0007TKNII|5.0|The ultimate love story, mixed with beautiful music, unbelievable talent, and extravagant costumes. This movie is so touching I have cried while watching it. Everything is beautiful; the emotions, the singing, the musical score. (and you can never go wrong when Gerard Butler is on screen - its a plus that his voice is absolutely incredible. The epitome of manliness).<br /><br />So try something new instead of Romeo and Juliet, and watch a work of art which will truly show you the world of loneliness, desire, beauty, love, and loss.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|If you loved the movie, you'll love the soundtrack.  Be warned though, some of the songs on the soundtrack are slightly different than how they are in the movie, which in some/most cases is a good thing.  Like for &#34;Lit it Whip&#34; you get to hear the whole song.  In the movie, they were talking over most of it.  &#34;Since You've Been Gone&#34; is quite a bit different becasue it replaces the campy parts where the &#34;bad&#34; singers sang.  I chose the deluxe version over the &#34;standard&#34; version for the couple of extra songs.  For a few dollars more, it is worth it.  One of the reviewers said that the songs were just &#34;snippets&#34; of songs.  Not true.  In most cases, the songs on the soundtrack are either full versions, or much longer than the versions that appeared in the movie.
B00009RGBS|5.0|Cinematography, costumes, songs, actors - all incredible and transports you to the past. It is exciting, fun, and seductive. Even if you are not a musical person, I know that you will enjoy this! There is a reason it won Oscars!!!
B00AOEA22I|5.0|When Frontiers releases new albums, they always seem to be very catching, and fun to listen to. Also the freakin rock! W.E.T Rise Up the 2nd album from the AOR super group. Featuring Robert Sall (Work of Art), Erik Martensson (Eclipse), and one of the greatest vocalist in Rock music Jeff Scott Soto (Talisman,Malmsteen,Pell,Takara) that's how they got the name W.E.T. members from each group. Anyway, this album from start to finish is great. There are only 2 slow songs on the album ,Still Believe in US,and Love Heals,also What you Want is a little on the slow side. The Rest of the album is straight up rocking,amazing Riff,great Solos,and Amazing Vocals, fast,Heavy , just perfect AOR is the best way to say it.I love the song Still Unbroken, but there really is no wasted track. Great Album Check it Out!!!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|A great mix of fantasy, action, drama, and love. I greatly enjoyed this show and also got the second season!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This story could not have happened without the technology of today.  Heart warming tale and well crafted/directed.<br />Enjoyed it immensely.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This film was visually captivating and along with a good story it had something for the whole family. In addition we streamed this movie from Amazon using a Wii U and the HD quality was very good.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|The app worked very well for me, as it played just about all of my different media files. If you play video media files for your Kindle or tablet this is a must have app.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Best series out there!! It is very a interesting time period in history. Very enjoyable to watch. Can't stop once you start.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very informative and to-the-point.<br />Most documentaries like this one tend to overdramatize.<br />I like this one because it simply explains what is going<br />on and backs up most of the information as it continues.<br />One of the most well-made documentaries I have seen.<br />&& I'm a documentary addict :P
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I needed a connection at work for my kindle fire for the days I forget to charge it at night. This works perfectly
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Good acting, nice script, excellent CGI.  Maybe it seemed short because I was enjoying it so much. Hope for more like this.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I use this in both Windows 7 and Windows 8.  I program Cisco routers/switches as well as my 396xt scanner with this unit.  Works exactly like a serial port.  This cable also just installs the driver no need to find the driver and install manually like some of the older versions of the same product, both W8 and W7.
B0045XICB2|2.0|still waiting for them to get more acting experience.  hoping it improves by the time the last one is premiered.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm not much of a reader but I got a kindle for Xmas so I figured I better start. Some people may argue that it takes a while to get into it which it kinda does but the detail and the story telling is brilliant! My attention was held the entire time. It's so mysterious you just want to keep reading and you have to read until the last page for all the puzzle pieces to connect. Read the book before the movie!!! I usually just watch the movies but the book was so good I don't even want to see the movie.
B008KX96OK|4.0|This book has beautiful pictures of the American Indians and shows the costumes/clothes for that time frame that the Indians wore.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think every one should play this game because it is really fun. Me and my brother play all the Time and its really fun because we try to beat each other's score like who can go the farthest. It's really fun too
B009EEFTMC|4.0|It's a fun, visually stimulating and engrossing game. I really enjoy it! Sometimes too much; it can be very addictive.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love this app,I check it first thing every morning for weather updates.<br />I like the extended weather forecast too they always seem to be totally correct.
B0010OIN90|1.0|My son loved it until the cheep clasp came undone and it fell off while he was playing. Now he has no watch.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was even better than the first one. It was very suspenseful and the ending came out of no where.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I loved this book. It was very calm yet adventurous. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good classic.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Love love love!!! Beautiful and passionate!! I couldn't stop reading this book there were parts where I would just up and down, catch my breath, shake or just laugh and be shocked!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This show has been a great science fiction that stretchs the mind to imagine it to exciting possibilities. I have enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone that enjoys a series that is filled with intrigue and great characters.
B009G78EE2|5.0|One of the best CD's I ever had! Love Macklemore! Everyone should have this CD and Listen to it. Good one.
1401235417|5.0|I completely enjoyed this collection, dark, spooky, mysterious, and action packed.  The art was spot on.  A very nice introduction to DC Comics New 52.
0470876417|5.0|Seeing is believing. Displays of a business model present or the future adds confidence in this changing and uncertain world. Fantastic book.
B0000025IE|5.0|1980 was a watershed year in Heavy Metal.  Judas Priest would be at the forefront with their breakout hit, British Steel.  Like Black Sabbath before them, Priest was a band from the industrial midlands of England.  Pop songs about puppy love, ice cream, and holding hands were definitely not their thing.  Theirs was a different reality.<br /><br />The album cover features a close up of a hand holding a razor blade with the band insignia and British Steel emblazoned on it over a black background.  It's simple, but effective.<br /><br />Breaking the Law is a quick and catchy tale of a desperado on the edge of society.  It's a favorite of lawmen, outlaws, and square john citizens alike.  Who hasn't thought of just abandoning their responsibilities to live the life of a nomadic bandit?  This is a two minute thirty three second escape from the mundane.  It's hard to say the title without chanting the repeated chorus.  Downing and Tipton's twin lead attack propel this head banging, fist pumping classic.  At one minute and twenty two seconds things shift into overdrive as Rob Halford belts, \\"You don't know what it's like!\\"  You hear the sound of sirens and speeding cars as a story is told with sound.<br /><br />Rapid Fire begins manically \\"pounding the world, like a battering ram\\".  Halford's angry piercing voice continues to sing about \\"hammering anvils with muscle and might\\".  The arpeggio laden guitar solo trades licks with Halford's shouted lyrics.  You can actually imagine molten \\"British Steel\\" emerging from the furnace during this track.<br /><br />You get a couple of seconds to catch your breath as Rapid Fire segues into Metal Gods with a slowed tempo and the leaden, staccato \\"dragging of iron feet\\".  Contrary to popular belief, the song is not autobiographical.  The band and Rob Halford in particular, would later be dubbed the Metal Gods.  This is a sci-fi tale of robots and technology conquering mankind.  It's a Precursor to [[ASIN:B00153ZC8Q The Terminator]].  Hearing Metal Gods makes me harken back to my pre-teen years when every kid in America was obsessed with Transformers, Go-bots, Robotics, and Voltron.  I love the harmonious chorus and accompanying riff.  Producer Tom Allom again paints a picture with sound as the iron feet march out again at the end.<br /><br />Grinder is \\"looking for meat\\", and, \\"wants you, to eat!\\"  A blazing solo punctuates crunchy staccato riffs that create subtle yet brilliant leads.<br /><br />United is the closest thing to a ballad that you'll hear on this disc.  Dig the sing along chorus.<br /><br />Living After Midnight begins with the simple recognizable drum riff, then the rest of the band jumps in and the song explodes.  This is a true rock-n-roll tale of one night stands and partying.  \\"My body's coming.\\"  I wonder what he's referring to.  Whenever I hear this tune I picture gleaming polished Harleys thundering down the highway at night.  Living after midnight features the best solo on the album and is another fist pumper.<br /><br />You Don't Have to be old to be Wise opens with a solitary guitar riff.  The second guitar, drums, and eventually the bass kick into a catchy chord progression.  Halford's searing, sustained, and reverberated vocals on the chorus underscore the young individual proclaiming his freedom from the daily grind.  Tipton and Downing trade licks during the solo, and then the chorus/title is repeatedly chanted through the fade out.  This is the longest track on the album at five minutes and three seconds.<br /><br />The Rage begins with a funky Ian Hill bass intro.  Halford exhales, a guitar feeds back and tension builds as the main riff thunders in.  There's a frantic solo, then back to the funky bass and building tension again.  Halford proclaims, \\"Like a tiger in a cage, we begin to shake with rage\\".  Guitars wail and lament during an out-going solo ending featuring a giant symbol splash.<br /><br />Another fast paced number, Steeler wraps the record up with some classic Priest riffing.  Solos drone in and out during the final minutes of this cut building up to one long sustained note to end it all.<br /><br />British Steel is some of the first metal I heard as a wee lad in the South Jersey suburbs back at the dawn of MTV.  Not only did MTV actually play videos back then, but rock videos at that.  I couldn't describe it exactly, but once I heard and saw Priest I knew what heavy metal was about.<br /><br />Are you really a metal fan if you don't have Judas Priest's British Steel in your collection?  I don't think so.lassic Priest riffing.  Solos drone in and out during the final minutes of this cut building up to one long sustained note to end it all.<br /><br />British Steel is some of the first metal I heard as a wee lad in the South Jersey suburbs back at the dawn of MTV.

I couldn't describe it exactly, but once I heard and saw Priest I knew what heavy metal was about.<br /><br />Are you really a metal fan if you don't have Judas Priest's British Steel in your collection?  I don't think so.

0061673730|3.0|Did you ever think to yourself, what is quality?  Most of us recognize it when we encounter it, but how does one articulate what quality really is?  We all know poor quality when we experience it.<br />Webster's New American Dictionary defines quality as:  1. Any peculiar power or property. 2. Essential nature, attribute, characteristic.  3. Degree of excellence, as a material of fine quality.<br /><br />It's the third definition that we are concerned with.<br /><br />Author Robert Pirsig tries to define quality and embarks on a long journey that temporarily costs him his sanity.  He flashes back on his story during a cross-country motorcycle trip with his young son who is also beginning to show the early signs of mental illness.<br /><br />Pirsig dedicates his life to defining quality and discovering its origin.  As an English professor, he assigns his students to write a paper defining quality.  He discovers that students that are only interested in a passing grade write one way, while students in it for the education have a totally different approach.  Somewhere along the way his personality begins to shift and he becomes Phaedrus, his other self.<br /><br />His journey leads him to study Greek philosophy at Chicago University.  There's a climatic showdown with a professor at the school.  At that point Pirsig/Phaedrus breaks from reality, flips his lid, and does his best Howard Hughes impression.  He locks himself in a room for months enduring his own filth.  His family finally has him committed to an asylum where he wakes up one day to find his personality of Robert Pirsig has returned.<br /><br />Towards the end of the motorcycle trip he feels Phaedrus returning to overpower him.  He contemplates sending his son home on a bus, selling his bike, and getting committed again.<br /><br />I had a hard time grasping the ending.  I'll admit that I may have bitten off more than I could mentally chew in reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.  I like works that are deep and consider myself to possess above average intelligence, but Maintenance may be a little too high brow for me.at are deep and consider myself to possess above average intelligence, but Maintenance may be a little too high brow for me.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Just tried out the app over the weekend. Three days into it and I find that it has improved the speed of input. I rated it 4 starts, but would probably rate it even higher once I have more time using it.<br /><br />Great app.
1451696191|4.0|I read this book because of all the hype I've heard about it and since I had already checked it out from the library for my daughter.  It took about 100 pages for me to get into the characters and story line but in the end I really enjoyed the book.  Charlie is a good guy who holds on to a lot of pain from his past.  His family overlooks him at times and his only friend is no longer around.  During his first day of high school you can feel his loneliness and sadness.  However, upon meeting some seniors in his high school, he gets to enjoy life as a 15 year old with friends who accept him for who he is.  There is definitely a lot of tragedy to this story but also a lot of good lessons to learn regarding love and acceptance and breaking free from your past.  Charlie was a lovable character, but I also really liked his English teacher who took time out to be there for Charlie.<br /><br />Side Note:  There were a few cringe worthy spots (sexual in nature as well as language and mild drug use) in the book that I was somewhat appalled my almost 13-year old daughter read but nothing too outlandish in these days and times.  Mostly, it's just a fairly realistic portrayal of the average life of a 15-year old.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|It's another of Quintin Tarintino great movies  along with Pulp fiction<br />I highly recommend this series 1 and 2 if your  a fan of his movies , he has his own way of getting things done  but truly unique in itself
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I've watched this series beginning to end multiple times followed by the movie &#34;Serenity&#34;.  One of my favorites ever!  I can never understand why the best shows get cancelled and the &#34;so-so&#34; ones keep going season after season.  Anyways, I'll take what I can get and rewatch this season if I have to!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|It was OK, but nor one of his best. Slower paced than many of his and even more disjointed than usual.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|I loved parts, hated others. I found the end, ended too abruptly. It feels like two books. The first 85% is a suspense/how do you go on, and the last 15% is \\"say what??? I read all of this for THAT ending\\" but overall a great book.

1926778103|5.0|I've had the book for a couple days now, and have been going through it extensively. I've even opened it up enough to have the pages lay flat. No binding issues, for me anyways, made some sounds, but no falling out pages, etc. Parka mentioned newer editions of this book have better binding, and I guess this is the case since I have no issues. This book feels like the new one (The Art of Darksiders 2), just more pages, not as much art, but yeah, definitely worth picking up, and I'm happy it's being republished, like all art books a premium gets made when things go out of print. Ditch the old reviews, and pick it up while you can :) And if the things falls apart in a couple of months, I'll let you know, but I doubt that'll happen. cheers<br /><br />UPDATE: just a heads up, yeah the binding is bad. Same goes for the newer Darksiders 2 book, both are of the same build. Pages are still together, just the glue is unstuck on the top and bottom third of the book, so only the glue in the center of the binding, and threading is keeping the pages together. I hope that makes sense. If you can afford the hardbacks, I'd go with those. Though they're a little overpriced, seeing that a lot of the darkhorse published hardcover art books cost half as much. Still won't knock it off the 5 star chart, since the art is amazing, and a must have for anyone remotely interested in this genre of art. cheers!
B00634GHJA|3.0|It looked as if it was going to take some time to figure out, and I just haven't done so yet.
B0064HJX56|3.0|It's the war on the arts. And poetry is the terrorist.<br /><br />Ever had a piece of really rich chocolate cake? Ever had a second piece, and then a third, and then a fourth? The second piece is pretty good, but not as good as the first. The third and fourth pieces  are way too much, to the point that all of it blurs into one sickening mess of sponge and cream and ganache.<br /><br />This book is like chocolate cake for your entree, main, and also desert. If poignancy is the chocolate cake, that is. Every moment is poignant. Each thought is poignant. Each conversation is poignant. Each chapter ending is poignant. Everything is poignant to the point that nothing is! It's poignancy overload.<br /><br />On the action-thought-emotion-trifecta-meter the book scores way, way, way high in thought. There is a great deal of thought in this book. There's thought whenever someone says something, there's thought whenever something happens, there's thought whenever something is described.<br /><br />When it comes to action and emotion, it scrapes a pass. Stuff happens, slowly. Occasionally scary stuff happens, and the characters take a gulp, but then quickly lapse into more thought before they have to feel anything.<br /><br />As for the characters, the main romance is rather draining and a little bit nauseating. Indie is by far the most intriguing and the snatches we get of her act as the bread and butter of the story.<br /><br />All this talk about \\"the pilot\\" and \\"the rising\\" gets a little repetitive and comes across as a tiny bit empty in a oooh-I'm-shaking-in-my-boots sort of way.<br /><br />This is clearly a book by someone who loves poetry and wants to pay homage to it. All power to wanting to pay homage to poetry but, sorry to err on the practical side, is there anyone in this fictional world who thinks \\"I'm not really interested in poetry or the arts. What about all the sports and  decent food and haute couture fashion the Society eradicated? I'm interested in revivingsome of that stuff!\\"<br /><br />That said, it's very well written. If you read it in calorie controlled portions.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was simply amazing. This book was written perfectly. Hoover's characters show so much growth from the beginning of the novel to the end. I absolutely love to read that in books. There was so much character development. There wasn't any instant love. That's one of the things I loved about this novel. Sky didn't lose her senses when it came to Holder. This story touches you in so many levels. You have to admire Hoover for writing her book that stands out in this particular genre. She made Hopeless stand out above and beyond. And those who have read this book has to agree with me.<br /><br />  Hopeless is a powerful, emotional and heartbreaking story. Have you ever heard of the phrase \\"What's done in the dark, comes out to the light?\\" Basically that's what Hopeless is about. It's about dark, horrible, hidden secrets that are meant to break you. Those secrets are revealed in this story. Hopeless touches a subject so taboo that most of the time it stays in the dark and eats away at the victim. I cried with so much pain for the main character and for every other girl out there that has been or is going through this situation.<br /><br />  But Sky isn't alone throughout this ordeal. Lucky for her, she has Holder. He's so in tune with her. His love for her is unconditional and that pulled at my heartstrings. His character was so well written. Holder knew that with Sky, things needed to be handled differently and with delicate care. Because he was just a victim in this story as well as Sky. However with Sky, my pain for her is raw. I feel for her the most. She goes through so much in this novel. Things are meant to break you for good. I just want to take her in my arms and embrace her, shield her from the people that has caused her pain.<br /><br />  Hoover wrote an exceptional story with Hopeless. I don't remember a book affecting me with the intensity that Hopeless did. I cried for Sky, for Holder and Sky's mother. Together they go through one of the worst experiences ever. Hopeless is easily one of my favorite reads of 2012. Throughout this story, I came to understand these characters and I fell in love with them. Together they make this story what is it is a 5 stars and a definite must buy and a definite Good Choice for Reading!!!!<br /><br />[...]asily one of my favorite reads of 2012.

B00BESCJII|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a well-acted coming of age story, that gives a grounded portrayal of high school relationships (between friends, or of the romantic variety).<br /><br />For anyone not familiar with the book (I wasn't) there is a fairly dark twist to the story. It adds some depth, and I don't want to ruin any of it, but if you're in the mood for a more light-hearted teen drama, that might not be the right time to watch this one.<br /><br />Still, great film.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|It has action, betrayal, and love. This movie was better than I expected, however it is not a five star movie.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This product was exactly what I was looking for. It looks slick, well made and it charges my Nexus 10 faster than the USB charger. Now I can just grab my N10 and not worry about the USB charger breaking. Overall 5 out of 5 definitely recommend this product.

1401941893|3.0|Treasure Yourself: Power Thoughts For My Generation by Miranda Kerr, is an all-around easy-read self-help book. It has two main sections, the first is set of small personal narratives about Kerr's life, each followed by a few questions and tips to help you rethink or resolve the issue at consideration. The second section of the book contains affirmations from various influential authors, and then expands those affirmations so that the reader can build his or her own affirmations from a more concrete group of images and ideas, making the affirmations more effective.<br /><br />This book is exactly for who Kerr says its for: young women who want to feel more empowered and inspired, and need an introduction to the field of self-help. The book touches gently on subjects such as gratitude, assertion, lifestyle, relationships, beauty tips, etc. It is a great 'check-up' for anyone feeling even a little out of balance, and of course its always fun to open the smooth pink cover and read about a favorite super-model and how she got to be who she is! My favorite section of the book is 'Dream Your Way To Success,' which gives some tips on how to use sleep and affirmations to magnify positive energy and attract a more desirable life. I had never read anything like this before, and so I had fun trying it! When I did, the words of the affirmations stuck to me longer, but I didn't dream 'the dream' exactly. I'll work on this -  thanks Miranda!<br /><br />FTC Disclosure: I was not paid for this review. I received this book for free from Hay House for review purposes, and the opinions in this review are completely my own.[[ASIN:B0054X3FQO Treasure Yourself]]

B0095P29EG|4.0|I really really enjoyed watching this movie it was sad,  funny and I loved all the action pack and graphics
B00BHU9DUK|3.0|Visually beautiful, no emotional resonance.  All connection with the characters lost in the attempt for production novelty.  Anna Karenina as Moulin Rouge.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Another excellent show. Has the flavor of Downton Abbey, with the intensity of city life.  The characters are quite diverse and well developed. Anyone that enjoys period pieces on the order of Downton Abbey will find that this is another worthy product to add to thier collection.  The look at the beginning of WWI and how the people of England viewed the coming holocaust is very informative.<br />Highly reccommended.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This book was, like Kite Runner, sad.  As I sit here trying to think of a better word to describe it, I really can't.  It spans two women's lives and the sad fate they are burdened with when war destroys their lives each in a different way.  It seems that the two women endure tragedy after tragedy.  The bright spots in the book are few and far between.  It was a good read, but if you are going through anything tough in your life don't pick this book up, it will depress you more....
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Case came in quick and it was perfect. The purple color was exactly what I wanted. My mom loved it. Also love the standing feature. Comes in handy often.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like it. it is very helpful. I like how it shows you your previous steps. I love it. it is the best.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|This movie is about as preachy as they come, and in 2D that tone ruined the movie.  3D was a different story.  3D immersed me into a strange world, and it was done so well that the story was secondary to the visuals.
B004GYY714|5.0|I can listen 24/7 to my favorite Stations and music, and it is free. Try Swiss Radio Classical or - Jazz stations, you will be impressed.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|This Bond really did nothing for me.  The story was not intriguing at all, but the action was fun.  While I like the fact that it shows us an aging Bond I thought it to be ham-handed in the story telling.
B001HN69AY|5.0|This film, especially the beginning, reminds me so much of the best of Fellini. The sights and sounds wash over the viewer, and pull him along. Hard to say what Fellini might have done with CGI, and a decent budget, but I think it would have been something like this. One can look for symbolism, and find it, or just go along for the ride, and have a great time.<br />So many films start off with promise, but have no pay off. This film delivers, if you have patience.
B004WE01YA|4.0|I thought 3d to be a gimmick, but I find that it really draws me into the movie.  This was well done.
0743297334|1.0|I was so bored reading this book.  After reading the grammatically incorrect sentences on the first page, I should have stopped. However, I was lulled by the great Hemingway name and continued onto the dull, dry book. It was so hard not editing his badly constructed sentences. They call this prose? Hah!!! No flow, no plot, not much in adventure and I could not wait to finish, just to see if anything was indeed worth the read. NOT! Don't waste your time and money. This book is worth starting a fire with or swatting a fly...that's all.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|You have seen it before, and you will see it again, but it is Batman.  I would not own this title, but it is worth watching.
1616550414|5.0|I am a huge Zelda fan and a veteran when it comes to the games.  I was just browsing around amazon when this popped up.  Didn't hesitate for a second and clicked the &#34;buy&#34; button.  Actually didn't realize how twisted the history was for Hyrule but the book outlines it really well for you.<br /><br />If you are a Zelda fanatic, you need to add this to your collection.  The book itself is just pretty to look at.<br /><br />Received it a week before expected, which is always nice.<br /><br />Highly suggest buying this item.

B007REV4YI|3.0|I look at all the four- and five-star reviews for Skyfall and ask myself, 'was I missing something when I went to the bathroom at the movies?' Cause I just didn't see this as a spectacular movie.  This was the first Bond film since \\"A View to a Kill\\" where I actually found my interest waning.  Now, before you start thinking I'm a Daniel Craig hater, know this...Casino Royale ranks among my favorite Bonds...this movie is no Casino Royale.<br /><br />First off, the art-house director, Sam Mendez...Eon Studios has been trying to use art-house directors to make a memorable art-house Bond film for years.  There was Michael Apted who directed the memorable though melodramatic 'The World is not Enough'.  And of course Mark Forster's lamentable \\"Quantum of Solace\\" (which, by the way, I find slightly superior to Skyfall).  Neither measured up to art-house quality.  Enter Sam Mendez...his doesn't look so much like a fish out of water like Forster's QoS, but it doesn't rise above the middle of the Bond pack.  The funny thing is the closest thing to an art-house Bond film was made by someone who is known as a master of the thriller genre, Martin Campbell, with Casino Royale.  This review will harken back to that high-water mark for the series frequently, moving forward.<br /><br />So where does Skyfall fall down?  Lets start with the second unit (action sequences).  Sure, the opening teaser sequence is thrilling.  The car-chase-foot-race-bike-chase-train-fight-crane-on-a-train-fight was frenetic and breath-taking.  Wonderfully filmed, too.  But it doesn't measure up to the parkour chase in Casino Royale's opener.  Jumping from crane to crane had me on the seat of my pants...much better than jumping from crane to train.  So, ok, great opener.  Then??? The second unit goes to sleep.  There are really no other set pieces worth commenting about, till the end.<br /><br />Oh, and about that ending...critics have been swooning over it since the film's debut.  I just don't get it.  Thebad guy walks around the castle tossing grenades in the windows to smoke Bond out...hohum. Compare that to the epic third reel of Casino Royale...Bond shoots the balloons to make the Venitian villa sink AND shoots all the bad guys AND the turncoat Vesper gets trapped in an elevator under water AND Bond tries but fails to rescue her...this was exquisitely filmed by the second unit and seamlessly constructed by Campbell who basically wrote a new chapter on how to tell a story in an action adventure film with that segment. I strongly recommend viewing the outstanding documentary on how this sequence was filmed.  The most that can be said about the third reel of Sam Mendez's outing was that Javier Bardem's face gets a maniacal glow in the flames of a burning Skyfall castle.  Big deal.<br /><br />But my biggest criticsm is reserved for the plot, which makes hollowed-out volcanos seem downright plausible.  <<SPOILER ALERT>>  Let me make sure I get this straight...the villain bombs MI6 headquarters to make them relocate to their old digs so that when the villain manufactures his own capture they can bring him to a cell that will just happen to be located next to a subway system that can be highjacked to create a tunnel from which the villain can escape (dressed as a bobbie with a pre-positioned uniform) so he can assassinate M while she's testifying before a subcommittee of Parliament.  Did I get that right? And we paid to see this AND said its the best Bond plot, ever?  I don't think so.<br /><br />Any other issues? Hmm, lets see...how 'bout the women.  Naomi Harris will make a wonderful Girl-Friday, I hope we see more of her in the future.  But we didn't see much of her in this film, which is a shame.  Berinese Marlowe...sultry looks, shallow part.  So under-utilized.  Before I knew it...she got what one of the good guys always gets about mid way through a Bond film.  I was disappointed in the brevity of the relationship (though the circumstances of her plight are riveting).<br /><br />Much was made about the return of humor to the Bond franchise in Skyfall.  Really?  I was expecting some serious chuckles but I didn't experience them. \\"Its the latest thing from Q branch; its called a radio\\"? Really? THAT'S the big return to humor? I return again to Casino Royale for comparison, which was a highpoint for humor in the franchise.  Example 1:  Bond, without skipping a beat, pretends to be a valet and parks an obnoxious tourist's Range Rover, smashing into the guard rail setting off all the car alarms while Bond chuckles and tosses the keys over his shoulder. He then uses the frenzy around his actions as a diversion so he can do some serious investigation...humor AND irony!  Loved it.  Example 2: the torture sequence in Casino Royale which had all of us guys squirming in our seats, then cracking up when Bond shouts, \\"NO! to the right...to the right!\\"  THAT was funny.  Skyfall was almost as unfunny as Quantum of Solace...almost.<br /><br />OK, so I ripped the film.  But it DOES have its merits, the aforementioned teaser sequence being one of them.  Which, of course, seques into Adele's wonderful theme...worthy of the Oscar she just got.  The completion of Dame Judy Dench's story arc for \\"M\\" is exquisite.  Her reparte with Bond in the DB5 is priceless (OK there was SOME well-timed humor in the film). Its always a good thing to see the DB5, even though I cringed at what became of it.  And I think the film sets up the series' next installment very well.  So all is not lost.  And while I complained mightily throughout this review, the fact remains it is far superior to most action adventure drek out there.  So I would say it is definately worthy of a view...I've already purchased the blue ray.  So EON has gotten to me, nonetheless.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|continues to be an exciting series with a lot of heart, slow build-up on crossing paths and shifting loyalties makes it &#34;believable&#34;
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Good movie, with a great ending... You really don't know how its going to end I promise! Its worth the time and money!
B008BGNMZU|5.0|I have loved this group ever since the TV show \\"Taxi\\" had their theme song written and played by them. Reignites the warm fuzzy feelings of the tougher years growing up and all the excitement of trying to grow up and be someone when you weren't born with a silver spoon in your mouth.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|surprisingly this game is addictive.  the game is just like the ones in arcades and will keep you hooked for hours. I like how you can still gain points while you're not even playing!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks always delivers and he always makes me cry! The Best of Me has well developed characters that you are constantly rooting for.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great book for anyone and nearly any age. Adults and children alike can relate to this book.  Well worth a read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was completely enthralled during the show and disappointed at the end of each.  The castle and furnishings are gorgeous!
B000ZBUY78|3.0|It's great that I never need to change the battery on this watch.  I think it looks nice and it was a good price.  The one downside is that slowly, but surely, this watch starts running fast.  About every 5 months, I need to wind it back about 5 minutes.  I prefer it running too fast than too slow, but ideally, it would just keep accurate time!
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I support wireless at work and it is good to have any tools. It helps find an AP if you have a mac address (radio) and any other odd ball wireless in the area.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Excellent performances by Helen Hunt, & John Hawkes. William H. Macy was funny, quirky as a priest. Explored the feelings of handicapped adults, & the trials they have to face.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Best batman by far. It illustrated the character perfectly. I'm excited to see where the series goes, and I would give this to my child as their first Batman.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a must-see movie for anyone who grew up in the Jim Crow South, or who has studied it. If you love the South, you will be stunned by the honesty of this movie. If you don't know much about Dixie, then this movie will provide a great introduction.<br />&#34;Would you care for another slice of pie?&#34;
B00622BF40|5.0|I'll never get tired of seeing this movie.  Twelve more words do I need, but now four... Three two one.
B00BHU9DUK|5.0|A complete re-imagination of what a movie looks like and how it is presented. Not only was the underlying drama well acted and told, the director's remarkable imagination to make this literally explode off the stage and off the screen makes this so worth watching. It deserves to be seen on the big screen or, at least, the largest screen you own. Totally enjoyable and a one of a kind movie.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|I like anything SyFy.  SGU fits that bill.  The episopes that i have seem i truly enjoyed.  Not finish yet in watching.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|first time watching this series got me hooked with sinker too, the characters are superb in their acting. wish they'd make a 6th season
B009JBZH54|4.0|these bat man movies are great but not as good as the first two with keaton keaton is by far the best batman but bale does a pretty good job as well
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Kyle had just been murdered and the book was mentioned in the news article. I purchased the book and could not put it down until I finished it. It is amazing what the man was subjected to during his service. Great insight into what the seals are faced with.
B007REV4YI|3.0|since daniel craig has taken over 007 they are not james bond films i do have to admit that this one was better than his first two
B0083IU84Y|5.0|I was happy to stumble across Jake Bugg on our local radio station here in Philadelphia (where the album is still unavailable unless you get an import.) It's great to find an artist at the beginning of their craft that incorporates such colorful variation to the sound. It's exciting to hear each song go in a completely different direction, and I'm happy to see someone digging up music history for it's songwriting richness and simple atmospheric effects. I hadn't realized how much I missed a good concise two minute song until I bought this album. These are simple songs that hook you with melody, a strong body of work that provides so many jumping off points for future albums. Go get 'em, Jake.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|i am a big fan of the wars i love these movies even though lucas messed with them too much
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Started using this a few weeks ago. Have it on everything. Laptop, Kindle, phone, PC at work. Am now paying for premium and have shared groups with family and work. Honestly don't know how I got along with out it.<br /><br />Only gripe is that I can't make my own server for times when wireless is available but no internet.
B003H6KRIE|4.0|these movies are full of excitement and action not a big matt damon fan but he is awesome in this trilogy
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't watch much television. We have Netflix and watch a lot of documentaries and movies, but after seeing some episodes from the first season, I was hooked on Walking Dead.<br /><br />The only other television show I've ever watched as faithfully was Six Feet Under.<br /><br />The best part is that I can get the shows the day after they air on Amazon. Love it!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Do you like CD's? C D's nuts.<br />But for real it's great. Almost every song is stuck in my head.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Edge of my seat at every turn of the page. I cried at the end when she left him. She's a very conflicted woman. I wish she would go back to him he is worth the time. Forget his money he's what this world needs respect and truth. He wants what he wants and Is very good at deserving the pleasure that he wants. I would give it to him whenever he asked I would sign the paper work because I love him and wait for years fir him to love me back.
B004J09ONG|3.0|I just thought it be more of the wild life, opposed to a movie itself. I was playing it for my little one because she likes to watch movies, or documentaries that include animals, it was not what I thought it was.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it kept you reading and was still captivating until the end. Would recommend and waiting for the movie to come put
B00BHMETKC|4.0|there were some parts done for &#34;drama&#34; that stretched plausibility.  But overall, really enjoyable.  I would watch it again...  Although not sure if it was really the Oscar winner.
0446615625|5.0|The Camel Club is sort of a ragtag underground group of four individuals who try to investigate various conspiracy theories. Oliver Stone (not his real name) is an ex-super spy type who is a cemetery caretaker, but who also mans a tent outside the White House where, several other permanent protesters also have their tent's pitched. The Secret Service thinks he is a little off.<br /><br />The other three members of the Camel Club are:<br /><br />Caleb Shaw, who has two doctorates, one in Political Science and one in literature. He was a Vietnam War protester who lost a brother during the war who currently works in the Rare Books and Special Collections Division at the Library of Congress.<br /><br />Reuben Rhodes, West Point grad who served three tours of duty in Vietnam, earning almost every medal for bravery you can get. After that he worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency. He eventually turned war protester and burnt himself out on drugs. He currently works for a warehouse company unloading trucks.<br /><br />Milton Farb was a child prodigy and posses more intelligence that any human out to have. Once he sees or reads something, he never forgets it. He is an extremely paranoid individual.<br /><br />The small and very exclusive Camel Club holds its meetings in the dead of night out on Roosevelt Island in the middle of the Potomac.

After the killers leave, they check the body and find that he was a Secret Service agent. The killers, come back, the four Camel Clubbers flee. The killers give chase, but the police boat comes by and the conspiracy theorists get away and now they have a problem. They have to find out who the killers are before the killers find them.<br /><br />And there you have the seeds of a thriller that will keep you well up past the dawn. David Baldacci has delivered up characters that are unforgeable, characters that just have to come back, and they do in THE COLLECTORS. THE CAMEL CLUB is what thrillers are all about. I couldn't it down, you won't be able to either.cci has delivered up characters that are unforgeable, characters that just have to come back, and they do in THE COLLECTORS.

B0099Y2YL6|5.0|My husband and I just finished watching Season 3 of Downton Abbey. We enjoyed it every bit as much as Seasons 1&2. The characters are endearing, interesting, and superbly cast. Highclere castle makes for a very interesting and authentic backdrop. Each episode is created to keep the viewer enthralled and anticipating the next.  The cast is wonderful, and Maggie Smith has some especially humorous lines.  As would be expected, Season 3 ended in a most unanticipated way and we are now anxiously awaiting Season 4.  Altogether a masterpiece of entertainment.
1400069807|3.0|For decades, I have been referring to the title of this book as America's three basic food groups. Salt, sugar and fat are the most abundant additives in food, and their effects are cumulative - the more we eat them, the more we can eat them, and the more want to eat them, so the more we eat them. The result is pandemic obesity and its further unintended consequences - miserable chronic diseases in an age just when we thought we were overcoming them forever. This irony goes unexplored, but the book is packed with evidence of it.<br /><br />The convenience of processed foods fits with our hurried society. It exacerbates the death of family meals, and encourages eating anywhere, anytime, and basically all day long. That by itself is enough to damn the industry, if traditional family values mean anything. Far more damaging than gay marriage, or abortion, or sexting, processed foods are destroying us, literally, physically. For hundreds of millions of Americans (and soon the world), this is normal. It is the way of life. There are no viable alternatives. This too, however, goes unexplored.<br /><br />Moss divides the book into the three sections of its title. It contains the usual litany of incredible statistics - like how much of these ingredients the average American ingests annually, and how many billions of pounds the processors produce, but also some interesting developments on the way to perdition:<br /><br />-Food processors call their customers users, like the drug addicts they want them to become.<br />-The \\"bliss point\\" is used by all of them to scientifically maximize the sugar effect along a bell curve. It allows food engineers to calculate how much sugar a child blisses out on compared to an adult, for example.<br />-Cereal makers spend twice as much on advertising as on ingredients.<br />-A child wanting cake for breakfast inspired Pop Tarts and its ilk. A whole new kind of meal evolved.<br />-Big Gulp, the 64 oz soda that New York's mayor is trying to ban, contains 41 teaspoons of sugar.<br />-Salt is a learned addiction. Newborns wince if you give them salt. But by six months they've accepted it, and for the rest of their lives they crave it. We start `em off young.<br />-Cheese used to be a food - an appetizer in the US, a dessert in Europe. Now it is an ingredient, and we put cheese in and on everything. We have tripled consumption to 33lb since the 70s.<br />-The cheese plague is the result of the Reagan administration's buying up and stockpiling excess cheese. The government bought it, marketed it, and provided it. Now it is normal to have cheese on everything, at every meal and snack. It's difficult to find any meal without it. \\"Healthy\\" salads come with cheese.<br />-Sugar is the methamphetamine of processed food ingredients; fat is the opiate. Perfectly legal drugs.<br /><br />An interesting sidelight is Finland, where the government won. It mandated large bold labels \\"High In Salt\\", like cigarette warnings. The result has been an 80% reduction in heart attacks and strokes. In the US, the processors beat back the FDA and the USDA again and again.<br /><br />The most disgusting food in the book comes from celebrity cook (and now diabetic patient) Paula Deen, who recommends taking a casserole of Kraft Mac & Cheese, scooping it into balls, wrapping the balls in bacon, and dropping them in the deep fryer. That's 0 for 4.<br /><br />The book left two indelible impressions: the industry will do absolutely anything to beat back regulators. Health, untested chemical compounds, overeating, obesity - never even enter their equation, and the processors won't be told otherwise. Their freedom to poison Americans at will is all that matters. Now that Americans are nearing saturation, the processors are taking on the world. Obesity in Mexico is comparable to the US, and Brazil and India are being worked intensely.<br /><br />Second was the overarching momentum and effort to overwhelm the consumer that make us think this isnormal, this is right, this is exciting, this is ideal. Two hundred choices of sweet breakfast cereal mean you must choose from among them, or why would they be there? To overwhelm us into consuming more, they mobilize as armed forces, saturating stores and neighborhoods with pretend foods that do far more harm than good. The industry is on autopilot and is out of control. Their intensity is fearsome. This is war.<br /><br />On the plus side, Sugar Fat Salt is enormously well researched. No lead, no document seems to have been too insignificant to follow up and interview the writer. Visits to executives, to factories, to stores, to conventions - all make the book comprehensive, thorough and fair. This is due in no small part to the interviewees themselves, who came to the conclusion on their own that what they were designing and selling was bad for living beings. Often, Moss found they were working to undo what they had done to the world. And they were, as he admits, incredibly open and generous with their time. It shows.<br /><br />On the minus side, for all the evidence, the book draws no conclusions. There is no prescription, no way out. Moss does not call for the investigation, dismantling or regulation of anything. The facts he found are left to speak for themselves. The book simply ends.<br /><br />Also on the minus side, Moss sometimes takes forever to deliver a fact. He'll foreshadow it in one paragraph, then spend several sentences describing some office building or scene before finally delivering the fact you were expecting. I guess he thinks he's adding color, but at 400 pages, Sugar Fat Salt could use a little pruning of its own.<br /><br />The relentless pounding of the consumer is replicated by relentless pounding in the book. Case after case of singleminded efforts to get users hooked, of the thoughtless ruination of perfectly good foods that need chemical compounds to make them palatable again, and of the constant pressure to cut costs and increase sales are depressing insights into what's wrong with the food industry.<br /><br />It's both insulting and sad, not to mention infuriating. The solution is as obvious as it is fantasy: people should steer clear of these poisons.<br /><br />In the words of fitness buff Jack Lalane - if man made it, don't take it.<br /><br />David Winebergnormal, this is right, this is exciting, this is ideal.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham uses all of his skill to put &#34;The Rackateer&#34; together. I was completely snowed as to where the story would go and it blew me away. Smart, crafty, mysterious, and just downright GOOD! I would have paid any price and felt it was justified to read this one!
B0088WK27S|3.0|I so wanted to love this movie.  My wife and I loved the trailer and ignored similar reviews when we rented this.  This is basically the most depressing movie that you have ever seen about an egotistical jerk who seems out to care more about his own legend than about the people he is trying to save.  Save yourself two hours of viewing and 12+ hours of depression.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One reader decscribed this book as a slow burn, while it is that, the author immediately hooked me like a fish leading me around the plot where she wanted me to go and then &#34;BAM&#34; turned the tables on me! She played and toyed with me like a puppet and the ending was totally unexpected! If you love a smart and entertaining story, Gone Girl is for you. Read it, you will not be disappointed.

I think you either love his style or hate it and we are lovers!  We are in love with Sparky!  Great story...didn't even notice it's in black and white...(we actually said that to each other at the end).  It had us watching every minute and loving it.  I purposely got this version Blu-ray/DVD Combo because I wanted to see the 30 minute version he did in 1984 that comes on the Blu-ray disc, although most of our players are still DVD.

B0037VNX44|4.0|Actor Tom Hardy does an excellent job bringing depth to Michael Peterson/Charles Bronson.  It isn't easy to play &#34;England's most violent prisoner&#34; and not have your audience either revolted or feeling 'social-worker-sorry' for this unusual true-life lead character.<br />The movie deals with Peterson's nearly life-long stay in Britain's prison system, but avoids being overtly preachy or overly sympathetic toward a man who is obviously every bit as guilty as he is a victim of the system.<br />The film comes at you from several directions.  Sometimes Peterson/Bronson is telling you directly--in a stage performance medium, and here Hardy excels with amazing acting...letting the viewer feel and separate the layers of his narration.  Other times, the film goes into 'regular' film mode, and you're watching Bronson's experiences unfold.  It is this multimedia approach that makes the film different from a run-of-the-mill prison diary...and either draws viewers in with it's artistic approach or lets them down if they were expecting a typical &#34;prison movie.&#34;<br />I liked Bronson, but I do warn viewers that it IS unusual in its presentation.  Some would call it &#34;arty&#34;.  It is also violent, adult and thought provoking.  But Tom Hardy's performance is first rate and in&of itself worth the rental.
B0012268N8|5.0|The [[ASIN:B00AWQEKIK \\"Carry On\\"]] Stills 4 disk set compiled by Graham Nash w/ Joel Bernstein includes eight Manassas songs plus \\"Isn't It About Time\\" from Manassas 2: tracks 1,2,3 and 8,9 and 12,13 and 20.  To my ears these songs are those with the strongest harmonies. Some of the cuts on Carry On are alternate edits, or by Stills alone. My take on it is this: that this Manassas recording is one of the major albums of its era. It's no smoke to own and listen to the whole thing, to get the ebb and flow and rapture of all twenty-one with original harmonic structure and power playing. It's original art, like a DaVinci.
0316228532|5.0|I really enjoyed this book by J.K. Rowling. She does an amazing job weaving together all the characters in this book and developing those characters so that you believe you know them well. This would be a good choice for a book club since Ms. Rowling deals with a variety of topics that would make for interesting discussion.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I loved Casino Royale. Quantum of Solace...not so much. Before Skyfall's release because I  was a bit hesitant because of the previous movie. Upon release, there was a tremendous amount of positive reviews. So I caught it in theaters and I loved it. It almost felt like a reboot of sorts. It took Bond and simplified it. Gone was the outrageous stories, unlikely characters and unbelievable weapons and went back to its roots. I can not recommend this movie enough.<br /><br />I am pleased with the Blu-ray release. It seems like a few studios have caught on to negative feedback from consumers about UltraViolet and have now started packaging an iTunes digital copy AND an Ultraviolet copy. This is a great idea and pleases everyone. If more studios followed this, I would be more inclined to purchase.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|If you like Adam Sandler movies, you'll like his play on the father-daughter protect-her-from-everthing relationship. The movie is nicely animated, has interesting characters, and fun scenes.  Ultimately, my kids liked it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|While I have not mastered this game, it keeps me on the edge of my seat.  I like outsmarting the &#34;cop&#34; and sailing over the trains.  Very engaging and good clean fun despite running away from the cop.
B00000DR52|5.0|I love this album as long as how I love the movie. My words are pale. You really need to listen to this theme melody and cry with it! Main Title Theme (The Last Emperor) is my favourite. and this melody appeared in many ads in China yrs ago, which makes this sound more famous than the album or the movie itself. Must have!!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|The airily fun thing is to see how it mimicks exactly what is said.  I like when it is set to playback music; especialy reggae style.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|I love this album since I watched the movie Avatar in theatre twice. I can recall lots of scenes by listening to this album. The rhythm is just as beautiful as the screen. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Avatar and Soundtracks!

B005K17RU0|5.0|No nonsense user-centered design makes this smart tool a winner. Intuitive and very capable. Integrated radar a big plus, with alerts and appearance customizations. Content from top-notch meteorologists is the main attraction. Why aren't all phone apps for Android this good?

All of my pictures are available from one product to the other.  I downloaded this on my mom's tablet, and it broke. She was able to add it to her new tablet and all her pictures were there again. She was thrilled! Sincs with Facebook as well.

B004SRPXWQ|5.0|This is actually a hit with my kids. I bought tablets for my 10 year old son, 7 year old son, and 2 year old daughter for Christmas, and this is one of the things I pre-loaded prior to opening Christmas morning. It was adorable watching them play with it. My 2 year old daughter finds it most fascinating, and talks to it and it mimics her back. I think it helps her pronounce words correctly, I see her repeating things if they didn't sound right mimic'ed back.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|Loved it for only five months..... Now I hate it because it doesn't work anymore. I truly do not understand how this item can stop working when it's plugged into the same brand new iHome for five months. For $25 very pissed!! Must be of poor quality.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My family and I love this product because its the only USB cable that doesn't cause us problems. So much that my other cables, like this one,  were disappearing only to show up later in a child's room.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It was a fun movie.  I was entertained and found myself rooting for the girl singing group to do well.  The singing makes the movie.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|I saw Top Gun IMAX 3D in the theaters in the movie theater TWICE last week.  It brought back a lot of awesome memories of one of the coolest movies in the 1980's.  What kid doesn't like jets and bombs?!  The F-14 is one of my favorite fighter jets of all time.<br /><br />If you missed out on the showing of the IMAX 3D version, this is the next best thing.  The first DVD shows the movie and includes 4 music videos from the soundtrack that has sold over 7 million copies in the US alone.  The second DVD shows the making of the movie from start to finish.  It includes interviews from Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, and many more.  No Kelly Magillis.  What else has she done?  Nothing that I know of....<br /><br />Overall, I recomend this DVD to the world.  I feel the need.....the need for speed. OOOOHHH!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I don't normally write reviews, but I would be doing this author a disservice if I didn't rate his book for him.<br />I found this story wonderfully detailed, good strong characters, extremely  engrossing.<br />I strongly recommend.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|I love all the movies Mark stars in.  This  is one of his best.  He keeps focused and to the script.
B004X4QW42|4.0|I really enjoyed Ip Man 2. I still think the first one is better, but as a follow-up Ip Man 2 is far better than most follow-ups. The fighting scenes are no doubt amazing. I also like the multi-dimentionalities of most characters. With the exception of the obnoxious English boxer, nobody was simply good or simply bad.
B009WJ2XT6|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack despite the bad reviews given here particularly if you like nuances of cultural sounds mixed with Bond.  I am not sure why the soundtrack received poor reviews because I consider it one of the best Bond sountracks I've heard.  We're no longer living in the 60's and 70's and neither is Bond.  We have a sophisticated, intelligent, aggressive, and updated man for the times...and we have a soundtrack to match.  I also wonder why so many customers purchased the soundtrack without first seeing if it contained Adele's theme song.  It's customary to release Bond soundtracks without the theme song and then include it later.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very inspirational book about Chris Kyle's life in the military. Tells a tail of a man that went from a ranch hand to the most deadly sniper.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This was by far better then any of the paranormal activity movies. I would recommend this movie to others who like scary movies.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love mythology. I can't get enough of it. When I was a kid, I used to want to 'do mythology' when I grew up. To bad we didn't have books like this. Rick Riordan is one of those young adult writers that I think everyone from my generation wishes had been around when we were kids, as we read very informative but much less scintillating mythology books. He brings the Greek myths to life and modernizes them. I know that especially in recent years, there's been a glut of Greek and Roman historical and mythological stories in print and on television. Still, Mark of Athena, and his previous books of this series sucked me right in. I remember also that when I was a kid, I read Edith Hamilton's Greek Mythology book so many times that I could spit out random details of just about any myth, whether people wanted to know about them or not. And still, he weaves details of myths into the stories that I either forgot, or never knew.    As to the story itself, I don't want to give too many spoilers, but his characters have deepened since the first Percy Jackson book, all of the characters, and he quickly establishes empathy with the new ones. I like that he has different aspects of the Greek and Roman gods, and like their parents, the kids of these gods are also different depending on their Greek vs. Roman culture. I'm an anthropologist so I keep returning to that, but he did a great job of personifying things about each culture that made them more than cardboard sets, the Roman work ethic and high level of organization and standardization, the Greek individualization and how each fit into its own historical time. As to the characters, Hazel was one of my favorites. I like that he took a fairly unpopular god and made one of his kids a real hero. My only quarrel is that I wish he would do more with Nico di Angelo. I've felt like that kid's gotten the short end of the stick, and I tend to lean toward the underdog, in this case, the Underworld dog. I'd like to see him open a can ofwhoop-butt on the giants in the next book. The only other quarrel I had was that the main heroes are always very supportive and awesome to each other, and their character flaws have mostly disappeared. Except for some girl rivalry between Frank and Leo, and a little bit of machismo between Percy and Jason, they really don't break down into real crankiness or quarreling, which, if my experience of teenagers is typical so far, just isn't the case as often as this would imply. Granted, they have had to grow up and be war veterans really quickly, but I know adults who don't always act as consistently mature as these kids, including myself. So while they are terrific heroes, I'd like to see them be a little less well-behaved in the next book.    That being said, my seven year old daughter is now going insane realizing, since we just finished the book, that she'll have to wait to find out what happens until the next one. She literally shrieked, \\"Nooooooooo! It's not fair!\\" when we finished the book. I concur. I hate waiting. But it's definitely worth it.    Rachel Coles--Author of Pazuzu's Girl  [[...]]

1609611543|3.0|If you are not diabetic, the dietary recommendations in this book are too drastic. For example, you are not supposed to eat brown rice, sweet potatoes, gluten free foods, or even a whole orange or apple. This is ludicrous. I can see the point about eliminating wheat and I agree with the author's rationale. But his reasoning behind eliminating these other healthy carbs is that they spike the blood sugar too much. Who cares if you don't have high blood glucose to begin with? This kind of zealotry discourages people from sticking to a wheat free diet. After all, 90 percent of the grocery store is already off limits when you just get rid of wheat. The bad part about diets like Atkins is that they are too restrictive, causing people to cheat.
0345803485|1.0|All I know is that this author must have over 7,500 friends and family who gave her a 5 star review.  This is by far one of the worst books ever written.  I could, maybe, see a young teen getting somewhat excited by this mess but really?  A grown adult?  The sex is laughable, the characters implausible, the Repetition grueling.  This book left me feeling nothing but contempt for the characters.  But.... guess what?  The author is laughing all the way to the bank.  I can tell you now, it will be a cold day in Hell before I ever read her again.  That's the last $10 she will get from me.  Fool me once, shame on you... well, you know the rest.  Please save yourself!  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I didn't expect much of this, but when I watched it on Amazon Prime with my family, I loved it! It's one of the few films that has made me laugh out loudly! What a good feeling.<br /><br />The story is a familiar one: a chameleon is set on an unexpected journey. His journey turns into a quest. His acting experience and new situation give him an opportunity to create a new Rango from scratch (including the name). He finds out that he can be who he really is, and that's what it takes to be a real hero.<br /><br />I loved the illustration, even though I often didn't know what the creatures were. Very well drawn and imaginative. I especially liked Beans. Have no idea what kind of animal she was supposed to be, but I liked her drawing.<br /><br />I loved the voice talent, too. Very well cast.<br /><br />Although there are a few swear words, like \\"hell\\", I would recommend it for the entire family.
B004YM6JI2|2.0|I LOVE SUPERNATURAL AND WAS SOOO EXCITED TO GET THE SEVENTH SEASON BECAUSE I DID NOT CATCH IT ALL WHEN IT WAS ON TV.  I WAS DEFINATELY NOT DISSAPOINTED!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved, loved the show but the feed to my computer was below standard.  It kept going off the show and I would have to go back to square one to get it back on.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Acting good; costuming, set, and storyline intriguing. It had some similarities to Downton Abbey but not as good as that!
1400069807|5.0|If you wonder why you can't lose ten pounds, why our kids are getting fatter and sicker, read this book.<br /><br />Every day as a producer on The Dr. Oz Show, we would come up with ideas to show viewers how they can lose weight and look younger. Michael Moss' book is a fascinating read that exposes a root cause to America's weight problem - convenience foods, processed, packaged and heavily marketed to Americans like the Oz viewer, are designed like stealth bombs. You don't see them as weapons. But they have the potential to add pounds of belly fat and contribute to the epidemic of chronic diseases in modern America.<br /><br />Michael's meticulous research reveals the insidious enemy to your best intentions to eat well. His access to shocking insider documents, and interviews with the scientists who developed convenience foods, blow the lid off of Big Food's experimenting to get us hooked to buy more packaged foods. He introduces us to rich characters who design food to appeal to our body's basic needs (Salt, Sugar, Fat). But it's not just a biology experiment. It's physiology, economics and psychology. The goal is to create food that we can't stop eating, neatly packaged and hawked to our impulses to take care of ourselves and our families, despite our harried lives.<br /><br />Ultimately I found the book hopeful. If smart people can figure out how to appeal to our body's basic desires, surely they can design packaged foods that put health first, that don't encourage us to overeat, that don't use excessive chemicals, that don't rob your bank account. Bravo, Michael, for your reporting that helps us choose more carefully and take control of our bodies, weight and lives.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I have been using several of this type of Ap for several months & with Wunderlist 2 and their latest Updates, the sync problem have seemed to disappear between our MAC, iPad2, & KindleFireHD.  They all sync fine today & I hope they stay that way.

1591391105|5.0|This book offers strong substance and structure when it comes to taking on a new role.  It provides specific direction and suggestions on how to attack setting up a learning plan, establishing relationships with your boss and other key players, as well as the importance of observing the new culture.  I have more confidence going to a new company after 12 years with my current company because I have a definitive plan for how to attack the most important time during a new transition.
B0085YNML2|4.0|It was cute but very slow moving.  Get it for your kids to waste time on your Android or iPhone or tablets.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I got this app for my daughter and I have been sneaking off playing it too. It is a bit slow moving though (in order to earn crystals). It can also be a bit confusing for my daughter to figure out the tasks that the people give.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|the quality of picture is blurry. I don't like the set up of the camera, wish there was a way to edit pictures with black and white or sepia.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|These are some of my favorite movies, so of course I had to upgrade to blu-ray when the $25 special happened!  These look great in blu-ray, you won't regret this purchase if you are a fan of the movies.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Great presentation of the human-side while not leaving out the tactical details. A good tribute to the men that served.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Very neat box set for probably my favorite recent hero based franchise.  Nolan did a great job with re-inventing Batman and it is too bad he vowed to stop after 3 films.  The set also comes with a neat little book to flip through, but the movies are really what it is all about and they do not disappoint.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It would be a vast overstatement to say this is a good movie. The plot could be accurately predicted from looking at the poster. The characters are neither especially interesting, nor well acted. The emotional arch is flat.<br /><br />And despite all of this, I really enjoyed the movie. Not only did I watch it once, I watched it a second time the following day!<br /><br />It may have helped me when started with low expectations. Also, I really enjoy musicals and shows about singing (Fame, Glee, Smash). I was impressed with how many times I laughed at lines and situations during the film; some of the writing was clever. But most importantly in a movie about singing, is the quality of the voice and arrangements. If I was grading the movie just on the singing I would give it 5 stars.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I always prefer to buy movies within the first week of them coming out, just so you can catch an early deal on them.  In this case, and with it being on Amazon, this release of Skyfall was $5 cheaper than in stores and probably $10 cheaper than it is now.  Good film, loved the references and homages to previous Bond films.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I thought the singing was quite good.  Story was predictable. The 2nd time I watched it, I only gave my full attention when the music scenes were played.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|When I was a young woman, when I loved the Greek tragedies, and when I read all the must-reads of my generation, I might have liked this book, and this series a little more. I remember my mother's telling me that she'd experienced too much of the realities of life to find stories like these entertainment, that she needed things to make her laugh. That's how I feel, especially after reading this last book in this series. I, like my mother, have seen too such of the kind of  atrocities that human beings can inflict on each other to find this other than horrifying. There is no escapism in this. There is only a sense of numbing horror. This is not a book I'm glad I've read, however well written it might be. This is a horror story.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Almost thought this thing didn't work and was P.O.S. at same time.  Turns out this thing is directional.  The finger recess goes up (screen side).<br /><br />I didn't notice the finger recess at first and thought it could be attached either way.  Nope, it attaches very securely with the magnets but right side up only.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I don't usually watch a movie over and over, but I know I will watch this one many times.  I saw it in the theater the first time and it's worth owning.

B00A8LYYI0|3.0|Gentleman on Amazon Forums advised me that Silent Hill was in 3D for shutter/passive glasses.<br />My initial exposure to this movie was with my Asus Laptop G74sx, 3D enabled with shutter glasses that never failed before. But it failed tonight. My initial opinion was flawed based upon past experience and my Asus G74sx having some kind of software conflict. Assume the conflict was with Opera, Safari (both work famously in Windows 8), Java, Corel WinDVD. Did a System Restore Point. Viola! The Asus laptop was back to true 3D.<br /><br />In the mean time I took the gentlemen's word and played Silent Hill 3D on my LG 47\\" passive 3D TV. The Silent Hill 3D Was awesome. The colors vibrant. The 3D exceptional. The fine gent knew what he was talking about.<br /><br />I wrote what I saw. I never suspected my Asus G74sx was in conflict with another program causing my Asus G74sx to play 3D only with anaglyph glasses. Have Blu-Ray 3D films that are only to be used with anaglyth glasses.<br /><br />The above is my correct opinion of Silent Hill 3D. Perhaps, the best 3D FX I have ever seen.<br /><br />This movie is a teen girls Saturday night screamer.<br /><br />This film satisfied my 3D hunger.<br /><br />It ain't bad. It is a Friday night,  teenage girls scream kinda flick. Flashes of brilliant 3D gadgetry set amid a ridiculous premise.<br /><br />Like 3D so I bought this release as soon as I could due to 3D hunger. Places, even in the mall, Happy Burgers there was no color whatsoever. The zombie looking customers were in black and white.<br /><br />There is no color in this movie. Everything is set at night or in dark places. They made no effort to put forth a really good visual product.<br /><br />This movie is only in 3D with anaglyph, red/blue/green lenses glasses. The studio did not even provide anaglyph glasses. How cheap is that? And one would assume the disc would be for shutter/passive 3D viewing,<br /><br />I have seen many a porn in 3D and the porn 3D is vastly better3D. The disc Properties revealed 43.5 GBs were used to make this flick. Go to wikipedia.org, type in anaglygh 3D. Take a look at 3D a century ago. It is light years better than it is now. A few big name stars in there. How embarrassing for them to be in such pathetic entertainment. But the show must go on so the rent and groceries will be paid.<br /><br />If you are a 3D junkie, this film is good enough to buy. If not, save your money for real 3D during the day.<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie. And I should mention I do not like the cast embers of these movies or their look alike stooges running around the hood trying to cover up there performance issues that has to be in the WorldTradeCenter equation.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|What a fantastic book. It's written in such a way that even though you are hearing events second-hand, you feel as if you are there. It really is easy to forget that you're even reading a piece of fiction and not in fact receiving letters from someone real. It is such a profound journey. As a reader, you really feel Charlie grow and evolve as he gains insight into the world -- both good and bad. But best of all, you feel, almost tangibly, like you are gaining the same insights and the same experiences even though you aren't there and everything that you're reading probably never happened. This truly was the perfect coming-of-age story.
B00B9366VO|5.0|I recommend this for all rock music lovers.  Well done Mr. Grohl!<br />Need more selections like this on Amazon.com.<br />I very cool piece indeed.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|I have never played a Halo game, and it is a very good chance that I never will, although I was aware of it.  I felt compelled to see this movie anyway, and I simply love it.  It is fun to see the way the characters develop as the movie plot moves along, but even better than that is the music score.  The music playing during the final fight scene is simply amazing.
1451627297|5.0|Great book, I was only disappointed because it ended, wish it would have kept going. Great read.It may seem like a long book, but once you get into it, it goes by quick. It keeps you going and really sucks you in.

0452295548|5.0|This book is the right combination to get both scientists & the non-scientific reader to come together to read, discuss & hopefully, gain new insights onto OUR universe. Written with humor, candor and (com)passion, Dr. Bolte-Taylor tells it like it was and is. Then she expects the reader to take it from there. It is not written in too lofty scientific lingo nor is it \\"dumbed down\\" for those who might not have alphabet soup after their names. Her list of \\"commandmants\\" for health care providers attending brain injured patients is spot on, should be mandatory study in medical school, & used as a \\"retro-fit\\" for others who missed it the first time around, especially physicians.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|very predictable story - compared too much to the movie &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy.  Not one of Nicholas Sparks best stories.
B00004XPPB|1.0|If you know anything about this story, the true story this movie could be considered fiction. They made lefty look like a chump or a clown,which is bull,nicky gets whacked,which is bull,and made brasco look like an angel ,which is bull,i dont know how he was a creditable witness with all the crimes he committed,he broke the law dozens of times and honest to his wife? Yeah ok,and im the easter bunny.. Sonnys the one who left his jewelry,not lefty,total nonsense. And they left out a dozen other characters,who im sure their glad they were left out. This movie had the potential to be a classic and they blew it. They dont make em like lefty,sonny&nicky anymore,al pacino was horrible as was the rest of this movie. Oh yeah, and how about donnie sawing the guys leg off,B.S.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|At first impression, I thought it is more or like kids game…but it is really good as I play again and again, I am more like addictive to this now. Nice creations and thoughts, especially I like the graphics with lots of surprises, gold coins etc.

B00006L9ZT|5.0|After I read some reviews I need to give an comment to these people who felt it was not\\" modern\\" enough.<br />As for my self, I would not appreciate an \\"modernized\\" opera ever.<br />For these who grew up with the culture of classics -operas and operettas, is Der Ring des Nibelungen an gift from heaven.<br />It saddens me that this kind of culture is still privileged only to so called upper class in America.<br />I am German and we were raised in this culture from childhood on. We have also \\" Kinder Operas \\" ( for children. )<br />It would be helpful for today's youth be educated in that direction.<br />Anyway, I do appreciate that Amazon sells now all these wonderful music on DVD, I have a collection and will make it grow<br />for my own entertainment. Richard Wagner - one have to enjoy in a good mood for his music. You melt away or find it to hard<br />to understand, in this case you should study him first or leave it alone.<br />Many thanks to Amazon from Monika Nilles

Then there were other parts of the book that tears were streaming down my face. The characters are smart and funny. As I was reading, I found myself wanting to know them.  I highly recommend this book!
B0012NVGHU|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite movies ever. The music is beautiful and it just tells a great story
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Installed the dolphin browser and a flash plug-in using this app. Now I have the full web on my Kindle Fire HD.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I guess I need to begin with my background with the show.  I am a longtime (but not diehard) fan of the musical.  I've had the chance to see a touring production and own both anniversary concerts as well as several different cast recordings, so I consider myself a relatively well versed fan.  (By the way, it really bothers me when someone who didn't like the movie says, \\"Oh, I'm not a fan of the musical, but I'm sure fans will love the movie.\\"  If you are not a fan and don't know anyone who is, I don't think you're qualified to say what fans will or will not like.  Anyway, I just had to get that rant out of the way.)<br /><br />I was both excited and guarded when this movie was announced.  After some of the recent musicals Hollywood has tackled, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I'm pleased to say it was a commendable effort, and the producers and director were fearless enough to experiment with both the long-running tradition of Hollywood musicals and a work as well loved as Les Mis.<br /><br />The biggest pro for me is probably the acting, with a few exceptions I'll mention below.  This is where I think the live singing really worked, as it liberated the actors to really act and play off each other.  But I feel like Tom Hooper was often operating under the mystifying idea that one cannot sing in the \\"stage\\" style and still act realistically.  First, anyone even remotely familiar with music can tell you that the best performances are the ones that tap into the emotions in the music.  Perhaps he didn't want to turn off audiences who did not enjoy musicals and tried to appeal to them by taking the music in a different direction.  All I can say is, the main reason I personally enjoy musicals is because of the MUSIC.  Second, musicals as a genre are not realistic; there is nothing realistic about people spontaneously bursting into song.  If I want realism, I'll watch one of my adaptations of the novel.  As I said, I can't really figure out the reasoning behind this idea,but it obviously hasn't bothered a lot of people.<br /><br />Now, I'm normally a purist, but I'll admit the numerous changes and excisions didn't bother me (for the most part), but many will undoubtedly find them distracting and/or annoying.  Things I wished they hadn't changed are the reduction in Éponine's role and the moving of \\"I Dreamed a Dream.\\"  Things I wish they had changed are some of the keys in the songs and the sequence of events.  By the latter, I men that it still felt TOO much like the musical; you could easily see where the intermission would go.  I think in this area, they were too eager to remain faithful to the stage show, where they didn't take full advantage of the film medium.  (I did like many of the book influences they threw in, though.)<br /><br />The cinematography and effects were a real disappointment.  They had a chance to give us some really sweeping scenery and some great action during the battles.  Instead, we get a lot of poor CGI, closeups, and shaky cam.  Maybe Hooper decided that we could get all our wide shots watching the stage, so we needed a ton of closeups in the film to capture the actors' emotions.  Again, it was a good theory that just didn't work in practice.<br /><br />As for the individual performances, I'll just go through some of them.  I'm going to preface this by saying once again that I did not like the style of singing used in the film, but I acknowledge it for what it was meant to be.  So when I say I didn't like someone's singing, I mean I thought it was lacking in some other way.<br /><br />HUGH JACKMAN: I was really excited when I heard that they'd cast him.  I thought he was a perfect choice, a fabulous actor with stage experience (a Tony to boot), a box office draw to please the producers, and he really looked the part.  Well, as usual his acting didn't disappoint, but I was surprised at how rough the singing was.  I think perhaps the songs were too big for him (he murdered \\"Bring Him Home\\"), and I thinkthis is a role generally unsuited for a baritone.  This is one place I'd have preferred some key changes to the straining, awkward notes.  Looking back on Hugh's work, I think he would have been more suited for Javert, whose songs have a range more suited to his voice; plus I have no doubt that he could be a very threatening yet also sympathetic Javert.  Which brings me to...<br /><br />RUSSELL CROWE: Let's face it, he can't sing.  That's fine, I can't either; it's not his fault.  But I think this really affected his acting, because rather than liberating him to really act, he seemed to be constantly focusing on hitting the right notes.  It was a very bland, very disappointing performance for such a wonderful character.  (It was particularly painful when Hadley Fraser showed up later in the film and I was thinking, they had a stellar Javert right on set and yet we end up with...this.  But I digress.)  Like Jackman, he murdered his character's Big Solo, \\"Stars.\\"  Not the biggest letdown, because I hadn't really formed any expectations, but still a disappointment.<br /><br />ANNE HATHAWAY: She's another casting choice I was really looking forward to seeing.  I knew she had a lovely voice, and given her mom's history with the role, I was eager to see what she would do with it.  Her acting was good (I wasn't as big a fan as some), and she was up to the numbers vocally, but I just don't think her performance merits all the attention it's gotten, let alone an Oscar.  (Yeah, yeah, boo me all you want.)  Some of it just felt like she was screaming \\"Oscar nomination!\\"  The sobbing through \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" really alienated me.  While realistic, it felt much too overdramatic.  The more restrained grief is always what brings me to tears, because you can see how hard the character is trying to hold it together when they know everything's lost.<br /><br />AMANDA SEYFRIED: Yet another one I had high hopes for.  I loved her in Mamma Mia, and I thought if she could tap into thatinnocence and sweetness, she'd be great.  Well, she did, to an extent, but I feel like she was trying too hard sometimes to be dramatic.  Her voice was also thin and uncertain in many places (surprising, because she sounded so good in Mamma Mia).  On the plus side, her Cosette was a genteel bourgeoise, which I appreciate because Cosettes often tend to be a little airheaded.  I see Cosette as being more naïve, as opposed to ditzy.  I could not stand the way they kept saying Cosette, though:  C'sette.  Her name is Coh-sette.  But I digress.<br /><br />EDDIE REDMAYNE: Probably the surprise performance for me.  I didn't know anything about his singing beforehand, so I had no expectations.  I thought his Marius was a good balance of the starry-eyed lover and the student revolutionary.  We don't get to see Marius as a revolutionary all that often; he spends most of the show mooning over a girl he's just met, but his part in \\"Look Down\\" does suggest that he's been very dedicated to their cause.  Eddie's \\"Empty Chairs\\" was also wonderful (for the film style, again), very moving, and here I again refer to my preference for more restrained grief.  He was probably my second favorite, after...<br /><br />SAMANTHA BARKS: Definitely the standout performance for me.  But that was no surprise; I had seen her in the 25th anniversary concert and thought her acting was spot-on there.  She's evolved the character since then, and some of the scenes with Eddie were really touching.  I can't say enough good things about her, really, and I think the more intimate style of singing really served her character well.  \\"On My Own\\" was probably the highlight of the film for me..  I look forward to seeing her on the silver screen again.<br /><br />SACHA BARON COHEN/HELENA BONHAM CARTER: Two more disappointments for me, especially Helena who can be so good at the comic-yet-sinister portrayal.  I thought they were both on the bland side.  \\"Master of the House\\" was really sleepy.  Strangely enough,I think they were both trying to play up the comic relief, completely missing the idea that the Thénardiers have a much darker side.  (He goes through the sewers and steals from the bodies of the dead students!)  So I didn't think they were either funny or sinister, thus a disappointment.<br /><br />AARON TVEIT: Forget Jackman, forget Crowe--THIS was the real letdown of the movie for me.  I'm including him because I'm just so disgusted by the reception his uninspiring performance has gotten.  He is probably the worst Enjolras I've ever heard.  Enjolras is charismatic, confident, and passionate.  These boys worship him and are willing to follow him anywhere.  I felt like Aaron was inviting his friends out to tea, rather than to their imminent deaths.  I want to feel like marching out in the streets with banners flying when I hear him.  Instead, I just find myself wanting to skip through all his parts because, quite frankly, they were just boring.  Aaron could have been one of the Amis, but they needed a much more powerful actor for Enjolras.  Do NOT think that this tepid performance is what Enjolras is really like.  The guy probably rivals Javert for fanaticism--but then, Javert was pretty bland in this too, so perhaps that doesn't tell you much if you've only seen the film.  Think about it this way:  he has no qualms about leading his friends to their deaths, or giving his own life, for a cause he believes in.  And in turn, his friends are completely loyal to him.  Please, movie-only viewers, go and watch Ramin Karimloo or Michael Maguire in the anniversary concerts if you want to see a real Enjolras.  Do not EVEN attempt to write an Enjo fanfic if Aaron Tveit is your only exposure to this character, because I will hunt you down, tie you to a chair, and make you watch both concerts before you get anywhere near your fic again.  (Okay, breathe.  Sorry, but Enjolras is probably my favorite character from the show and seeing his character destroyed like this makes mewant to scream.)<br /><br />Besides \\"On My Own,\\" the highlight of the film for me was unquestionably Colm Wilkinson's cameo.  And, as they said in one featurette, it was quite symbolic to see him handing the candlesticks over to Hugh Jackman--\\"passing on the torch,\\" almost literally.<br /><br />It's a solid film with a lot of good ideas that I hope to see developed and expanded on in the future, but not all of them worked here.  I don't feel the film deserves all the accolades it's been receiving, but it's opened up the world of Les Mis to a new audience, so I count it as a positive overall.  I recommend all fans of the musical see it at least once to form their own opinions, if only so they can chime in during conversations about it.  ;)  B+
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I love the Tudors..... I cant get enough of Henry!  One of the best series I have seen.  It is almost like being at court yourself!
B0040I09RM|5.0|We love this series. We have seen all seasons available and can't stop watching it.  We recommend to anyone.  Very well made.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Love the series,  while not its strongest year,  it advanced the story well, and as always the acting especially Anna Torv's was excellent.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Well acted and well done.  It deserves that Oscar for Best Picture!!!<br />Yes, it is not fully accurate but it is still great.
B0096HK4WW|3.0|Great horror film with classic special effects before the time of CGI. Of course the acting is pretty bad and forgettable, but the nudity of Barbra Crampton, more than makes up for it. Not to often when a severed head tries to preform cunnilingus. Enjoy with a Side Car Car cocktail along with some salted cashews.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The storyline, even though it jumps around a tad, is flawless. It takes a little getting used to with the many transitions but it is just great. Die hard Fringe fans shouldn't be disappointed. This is not a series to just jump in the middle of. Thankfully there are recaps offered for those who are starting late but to enjoy it completely you must watch this series from season 1 to the last.
B008GAXUYE|4.0|Overall a decent box set. I much prefer the Decca Symphonies Box Set or Decca piano music, Chamber works.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely amazing.  I cannot wait for the next set of books to come out and will not wait for the sale price.  Mr. Howey has an uncanny ability to develop a new world that has not been seen or done before.  I kept checking the page number, as I was in fear of the omnibus ending  and running out of story to read.  This one is going on the best books list in my Kindle!  You don't even need to like science fiction to love this book.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Beautifully represented, amazing costumes, historical content and amazing performances.  Ther best series ever!  Will recommend to any one interested in learning about the Tudors.
B002W5UVSM|4.0|Reminds me of the Fan Man which was better.  It is a far out book from any standpoint.<br />Took a while to get into this guy's head.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This cute and fun game had me playing for hours before I knew what happened. It is easy to learn and all I found myself wanting to do is lvl up more. The only draw back is the repetitive bosses but the creators tried to cram as much fun as possible in this light rpg.
B007P06DOK|5.0|What can one say. It's an amazing album, never tire of listening to it.  It's like the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over.
B007PVHANM|5.0|The most comprehensive review for the life of Bob Marley. A well researched document which got to the nitty gritty of issues other were afraid to put forward. His lifestyle may have hurt many people from politicians to friends and family… but all have fallen short. He paid his dues to the whole wide world. Well done Kevin McDonald
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Affleck is not only a nice guy in real life but one of the best filmakers of our time. This movie tells a very interesting story that we were no able to hear until lately.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|Old but good division of the classes in early 20th century Brittan. Well written and great cast. Jolly good show.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|4.0|The best: this album have amazing songs. Really catchy melody, epic compositions and incredible rhythms.<br /><br />The worst: Maybe one of the worst artwork of his carrear. The graphic concept does not match with this breathtaking album.<br /><br />Final consideration: If you are Helloween fan (or not), buy this album. Great epic metal work. At the end, the sound and music is the most important. Out of two or three songs, the tracklist is awesome.
B003L0HZ5O|4.0|i really like about 75% of the songs on this album.  the other 25% is not bad.  this is an outstanding and musically talented group.
B00902MCX2|5.0|If you are a melomaniac, buy it. One of the best album I ever hear. Awesome composition and incredible sound. For metal-lover, this a pleasure. For not, this album will expand your music knowledge. Just amazing!
0425263908|5.0|I finished this book in 1 Saturday, it is the type of book that draws you in and you really want to know what is going to happen next. When I was done with the first one I went early next morning to find the second one, because it is so addicting!!! The characters background it is so dark and creepy but the chemistry between them it's so amazing that is mind blowing. Yes there is some repetition that is annoying and the struggles are a little extreme, but the rest of the story is very passionate. I read 50 Shades after this book. 50 Shades is a horrible book weird and creepy and I skip like 3 chapters to the end......Not this book!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was absolute amazing. Words can not describe just how amazing it was. This is exactly why Colleen is my favorite author. Hopeless left me Speechless!!!!!
0345803485|1.0|This book is definitely a book written for a specific group of people, the weird ones.  It is NOT appealing at all! Not for a 34 year old women who knows exactly what she wants in bed and in life.  Anastasia is definitely a stupid ignorant girl and Grey is definitely more than 50 Shades nuts who takes advantage of her stupidity.  This book is boring, violent and not sexy, sensual or erotic.  I was expecting so much more from this book, since so many people were talking about it and is so popular, but it is such a disappointment.  I even skip the last couple of chapters because they were not interesting at all. By the contrary it was a little uncomfortable reading this.  This is definitely not for me, since I'm not into this type of creepy things.  Also, the language utilized is more for young adults in there early 20's, there is no passion, just kinky stuff.  It took me almost a week to try to finish it, because again it so ridiculous and boring and creepy. I know this is a book, but this will give the wrong idea for girls 18 to maybe 24 of what a relationship should be.  I'm not even interested in reading the other 2 books and I'm glad I did not buy the trilogy.  You want sensual, sexy and erotic for adults? Then do yourselves a favor and read \\"Bared to You\\" that is a book for real women.... and not for stupid girls. =D
0345529057|5.0|Great product<br />Interesting story, easy to read and confortable size (u can take the book in your handbag)<br />Thin pages but not too fragile
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was a great peek into history from all sides. You couldn't help but fall in love with the characters.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Large and easy to use. I love this app! It's wonderful if you do any type of in home parties or just your checkbook.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|angry birds is very very popular.many people play it in their freetime.many kids at school bring their phones to school to play angry birds and other popular games.even though they arent supposed to.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is an amazing game that is entertainment for all ages I would recconmemd this game to anyone who love to get lost in a game
B009NPM5Y2|5.0|Excellent music! Was a little skeptical at first, but my son recommened it and he was right on with his recommendation.  Very entertaining!
B008220C56|1.0|This is one of the worst movies of the year. Keira Knightly gives one of the most horrendous performances of the decade. This is an insult to Leo Tolstoy. The direction is laughable and the staging is boring and a disgrace to one of the great love stories. Stick to the 1935 MGM Garbo movie or even the 1948 Vivien Leigh film, but avoid this mess at all costs. Absolutely horrible.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app. No problems so far. Got for my kindle fire, it works really well so far. It has a large display that is easy to read.<br />This app was free so tat was good.
0399157565|5.0|Once again, a great book at an even better price.<br />I collect books--but I don't just collect, I read<br />them again and again!  Patricia Cornwell is a<br />author worth reading and has fantastic books.<br />Amazon sells them all for good rices in good condition.<br />I look and I find them again and again!<br />Why not repeat a good experience?  I do.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I saw this game several times and was not interested. I just didn't like the name nor the icon. But the ratings puzzled me. So, I decided to download it. It is too much fun!!! It is a wonderful game that challenges, frustrates, annoys and still keeps me addicted. Downlowad it today!!!!!!!
B004SDEP38|1.0|If all one needs is to look at files created with MS Office,  then this will work for you.  Their use of the discriptor \\"limited\\" functions is very, very misleading - it's actually extremely crippled!
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is the classical game. However, the touch screen component makes it even more interesting. Be careful of becoming addicted.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This is such an amazing story, and it is well portrayed in this movie. Kept me on the Edge of my seat, but also allowed for moments of getting the feel of what it must have been like over there, in that terrifying situation.<br /> And I love Ben.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|I find this movie to be relaxing, when I'm really stress or worried about something it seems to make me feel better.  Is just my cup of tea, it has great scenery, good humor, and life moments that are real.  I love it.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|The different sized tips on this stylus makes it a very handy tool. I use it on my Fire when my finger is just to large for some things. You can't go wrong with this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just love this show. There's been a bit of a lull mid-season, but I'm still very entertained. Zombies zombies zombies!
B0095P29EG|3.0|It is a movie based on a comic book, and done in a bland way. No great acting here, no sit on the edge of your seat thrills. Just a mindless romp through the history of Marvel's Thor character. There were attempts at playfulness, but they fell flat. The movie had some nice special effects, but even they were somewhat juvenile by today's standards. Although streaming it for free as a Prime Member was not a complete let down, had I paid money to see it I would have been disappointed. On the other hand, children around the ages of 7 to 10 years old might really like this movie.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I love the Matrix trilogy. I couldn't wait to get it on blue-ray. My joy turned into disappointed when I received the order and it was incomplete. One of the disc was missing its label. I called customer service and they were very helpful but the new item was also missing the label. I ended up keep the item because I don't want to not have it in my collection.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|My grand daughter wanted something to play so I downloaded this.  She gets bored with it pretty quickly, so do I.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Excellent response to broad frequency range.  Very comfortable for children and adults.  Excellent value for the cost.  Durable for frequent use.
B002UWH8P6|3.0|Slow story line circa Battlestar Galactica.  Seems you could miss a few weeks and still be up on the story line.  I believe this continued strategy led to the series demise.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|Absolutely love it!! Don't know why I waited so long to watch this show. One of the best shows. Great cast with a good variety of guest patients.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Good story.  Not exactly the good guy role that I like to see Denzel play, but he did an excellent job.  Would recommend this movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Although I found season two more intriguing because of the impact of war on the whole society, I enjoyed season three for its probing of issues: prostitution, homosexuality, economics, childbirth, etc.
B007SGM084|5.0|The best book series I've ever read! I was disappointed when I reached the end. I hope James continues this series for all of her 50 Shades fans!
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Three tight stories. I recommend this set of three as Connelly can weave tales.Also ,the price is right for an hour or more reading
B004R1164C|5.0|Good plot, lots of action, and fun to watch. I would recommend this movie to action fans or fans of Russel Crowe.
0307596885|5.0|I love the way she writes her short stories. Her characters come alive with each page so you get to really know them.
B000002KIQ|5.0|I should have bought this years ago.  Im loving Ry Cooder and his musical sensibilities.  Lovely arrangements and renditions of some good old time music.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I was looking for a cheap processor with decent enough graphics capability, and this fit the bill, being able to create a whole system featured around this chip for under $300. Reviews will abound about its middling CPU performance vs the latest Core i3 equivalent, and how it excels vs the built in graphics of any Intel chip, so I won't rehash that here.<br /><br />In practical terms, the processor (and the whole system) are snappy and let me do anything that might be required for even medium work. Desktop CPUs of any class have broadly been fine for 90% of the tasks one could throw at them for years now, and this is no exception. For those interested parties, it WILL run Server 2012 and Hyper-V / Virtualization just fine, and it will allow Remote FX. CPU parking works fine. Server Manager will pick it up as 2 cores / 4 threads, but this is how AMD presents it to the OS to maximize utilization with their architecture -- it is actually 4 cores.<br /><br />Temperatures are higher than the Intel equivalent using the stock cooler - the AMD stock coolers have been, and clearly continue to be, less versatile than their Intel equivalents. Temperatures under load hover around 55C for me, YMMV based on case and airflow.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Really great plot, well thought out.  You won't see the bad guy coming.  I can't wait to read another Jack Reacher story.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|For those who love dogs, this is a great video to add to your collection. This film shows the most wonderful aspects of dogs -- that they are so faithful and are able to show love and commitment for their people during their entire lifetime. Dogs have a great deal to teach people. Watch the film and see how a dog's love for his human is never extinguished from first meeting until after their deaths. A great movie!
B004U8VWLE|3.0|After hearing how great this movie was I was very disappointed!  Don't waste your money or time with this one.
B00AN0KBJC|1.0|Too bloody and violent. Found no redeeming value. Nothing else needs to be said.<br /><br />When a product is this bad, why do I have to take so long to pan it?
B001MSMUH0|5.0|The book shows a different perspective on how humans have been living their lives through a process of the typical industrial production chain. Sir Ken Robinson talks about the flaws of current education and how to get past them, proposing a new form of education focused on learning and not only on tests and results. The core of the book is about the stories of people who have been able to discover their 'Element', the thing they are good at, love to do, are willing to do and look forward to be involved with. Robinson describes how being in an environment in which people feel like themselves proves to be essential in living a full life. You must read this book if you feel like something is missing in your life, and I don't think this is a selfhelp book (although it might sound like one) because it is all about a vision we all should share.
1400067820|5.0|I have read Nassim Taleb's two other books:  Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan, both of which I enjoyed tremendously and from which I learned a great deal.  I just completed reading his latest, Antifragile, and here is my quick impression of it.<br /><br />As some here have noted, this book is not as impressive as the previous two, but I don't think that is because it is less insightful.  The book could've simply benefited from economy (heavy editing), but that, in my view,  does not in any way diminish its importance.<br /><br />Although I give this book five stars, I found it harder (more tedious) to read than the previous two because the insights in it are farther between--mostly due to its heft (400+ pages).  However, what he points out: the antifragility of nature, organisms, and of all of the human-related processes that evolved without preconceived, conscious planning, government intervention, or macroeconomic theories (such as language, culture, markets, etc.) is (to me) as insightful as anything he presented in his prior two books.  It is a message that should be shouted from the rooftops because it warns of the dangers of human hubris.<br /><br />That danger is that such hubris makes us more vulnerable to the inevitable black swans in our future.<br /><br />All in all, this is an important book that should not be missed.<br /><br />PS,<br />A quick couple of notes on (1) the meaning of antifragility and on (2) one of the insights in this book that I found particularly interesting.<br /><br />(1) Taleb convinced me that antifragility is real.  Briefly, the fragile is what brakes when submitted to stress, like a blow from a hammer.  The robust resists stress; that is, it doesn't break easily if hit with a hammer.  The antifragile, on the other hand, responds favorably to stress.  That is, it benefits from (or responds positively to) a certain amount of stress.  Unlike the fragile and the robust, the antifragile responds non-linearly to stress!  The many examples of antifragility that Taleb gives in this book are, in my opinion, excessive; going on and on many pages after the point was made abundantly clear.  Given that fact, what I find amazing is that there are people commenting here who (after presumably having read the book) still don't get it!<br /><br />(2)  A particular insight in this book that I found very interesting is where he comments on the apparent antifragility of certain ideas or beliefs.  The kind of ideas and beliefs that refuse to die, even after it has been shown that they are false.  His insight is that ideas survive to the extent that they help individuals (or civilizations) survive.  Popper's claim that ideas are in competition with each other and that the best (or more truthful) survive is, according to Taleb, mistaken.  Taleb points out that,<br /><br />\\"...it is not ideas that survive, but people who have the right ones, or societies that have the correct heuristics, or the ones, right or wrong, that lead them to do the good things.\\"  (Page 391).<br /><br />A very similar insight is offered in F. A. Hayek's \\"The Fatal Conceit,\\" a book in which Hayek (an atheist) pointed out the usefulness of religions in setting the climate, establishing the ethics, and fomenting the culture required for societies to thrive.<br /><br />So an idea (or belief) does not have to be true (or correct) in order to benefit society!  This is mind-blowing stuff!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This was a horrible movie. When I watched the trailer, I thought, hmm, here's a strong actor who plays a character with flaws, but probably overcomes them to do something good with his life.' I was SO wrong. This movie is all about booze and drugs, and while the character half-ass tries to overcome his addictions, he cant. So when he has to face the 'court' at the end, he has to snort coke so he can be serious enough to act like he's not drunk and high. It's ridiculous. I would not recommend wasting your money on this movie. And don't let teenagers watch it. Two thumbs down from me.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Really liked two of their songs (Ho Hey and Stubborn Love), so I bought the whole album and totally love it!

030758836X|5.0|A well-written \\"who done it\\". Great style and being a thirty-something, it's easy to relate to. I listened to the audiobook and it's wonderful.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the way the author wove the language of flowers into her gripping storyline.  I am now hooked on finding out more about the way we can communicate with each other through flowers.  Read it for our book group and finished it early. I was sad it ended.
B001HN697M|5.0|One more episode of the Underworld legacy and a way for the unexplained details to be put in place. I recommend this DVD to all who like me, wants all the versions of UnderWorld...

1475143389|5.0|I was looking for some good workout ideas and I came across this book. I'm so glad I did. I start to work out again an month ago. I had a few years brake. I love the 45min workout plans. Never get bored at the gym again. For last month I only gained 2 lbs, but I lost few inches in my waist, my strength increased a lot. I feel like most of my fat is gone, now I'm starting to gain muscle weight. I combine it with Mike's other book &#34;The Shredded chef&#34;. Great results.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  It was my first movie to download from Kindle and I thought it was great.  I give it five stars.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I loved this book as a child and I loved re-reading it now. I don't really like the heavy emphasis on the &#34;power of Magic&#34;, but the lovely descriptions of the garden are wonderful. This particular copy has a few typos and some areas where they forgot to start a new paragraph when someone new began speaking, which had me re-reading a couple of times, to try to figure out who was talking. I loved the practical child-rearing advice that is incorporated into the story.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A really lovely story about a man and his dog. It had me crying at the end, and I'm a cat person! I highly recommend this movie, for all animal lovers.
B000022TSY|5.0|This is a classic that I cant live without. I like going back in time and getting back in touch with the older simpler days.
0385535147|5.0|I'm a fan of Grisham's writings, and was not dissapointed with this latest novel.<br />Look forward to  more of his works.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The book starts out like Grisham of old, then deteriorates in the the Grisham of now.<br />Probably the last of his books I will ever read.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I love this show, suspense, romance and humor, what more can you ask for!  It is gory in parts though.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I chose this because I have abobe reader on my desk computer, and for what I need it for, it works just great for me.<br />I'm sure there are other products or upgreaded readers out there that do more, but my needs are slim.<br />If your job calls for something more indept, then by all means go for it, but if your need are simple and basic, then this works just fine.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I gave this a five because I love time management games, and cooking games. There is enough levels to keep you interested, and the characters are great, each having their own personalities.<br />Yes each level is about cooking at a restaurant, but each restaurant is a different theme, and you don't know what the food is untill you open the first day. plus there is enough upgrades to help you improve your skills.<br />The game starts out at a moderate pace, but picks up speed as you go throught the levels.
B004OR199G|5.0|This book changed my life. So much information to make informed decisions. Kris has a great sense of humour. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to better themselves
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Somewhat educational at same time as highly entertaining.  Ben Affleck was very good as was Brian Cranston and the entire cast actually.  Highly recommend this... not for kids as there are numerous expletives in first 20 minutes of movie especially.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun game! Great price!..FREE!... It's very addictive and once you start playing, it's hard to put down! It's challenging not to get the bombs!

B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I have always liked Ang Lee's stylistic and artistic work.  His cinematography is always captivating so when I went into this film my expectations were high.  There are no words for how far this movie surpassed my expectations.  Not only the best Ang Lee film I have ever seen but possibly the best film I have ever seen period.  Certainly in my top 5 of all time.  This is one I will watch many more times.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|This app does do what is intended of it. It does find all surrounded Wi-Fi connections so you know how strong they are but it is not intended to connect you or hack locked connections. It only tells you the strength.
B00ATU5JRA|2.0|It was not what I was looking for but may be the right thing for someone else. Did not work with my equipment.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I did not want to get into AMC's The Walking Dead, because it is what a like to call, addictive television. I try to avoid shows like this, but I was at a friend house the other week and there were a group of people watching it, so I really didn't have a choice and I got sucked into it's grip. The reason I don't like to watch shows like this is because it's based on a book, which usually means, the show is amazing and very well written until they reach the end of the book and have to come up with new stuff on their own. At that point, the quality of the story quickly diminishes and the show either gets boring or goes way over the top. As I watched the first two seasons of The Walking Dead over the course of a couple weeks, I found that the same was true for it. The first season was an absolute delight and I hated the fact that it was only six episodes. The second season started out pretty good also, but that's when the book must have ended and things changed. This powerful, exciting show became extremely predictable, with every episode featuring about forty minutes of talking and five minutes of action. So, if I was so turned off by it at that point, why am I watching the new episodes right now? Addictive television! Now that I know the characters and their stories I want answers to the same four questions as everyone else. Who is fighting with who, who is having sex with who, how will the story end, and the big one, who lives and who dies. Similar to soap operas, shows like the Walking Dead, for the most part, aren't well written, are extremely predictable, and don't really develop much after the initial impact. I didn't see a single episode in the second or third season that I enjoyed as much as I did every episode from season 1. I am nevertheless invested in the show and what happens now, and to be honest it's not that it's a bad show. I really like Sarah Wayne Callies from Prison Break and Norman Reedus's character is the one guy who really evolved into someonewho fascinates me. The action scenes, as well as the effects are terrific, and they do have a pretty talented cast. It's my hope that as it continues to gain popularity, that the writers turn to other sources, perhaps the author of the book or even some fan fiction for alternative ideas on how to keep things fresh and interesting, because right now, aside from the question of who lives and who dies, there isn't much there to attract new viewers to the show. If you like dark stories, horror, and end of the world type fiction, I'd give the show a try, but if you're a newbie whose thinking about getting into the Walking Dead, I warn you, the first season is amazing and will suck you in, but after that, as of yet, it hasn't gotten any better.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I love shania twin and this disc is perfect,no expensive and romantic,thanks for make my dream come true ..... thanks
0765325950|5.0|Masterful job of tieing everything together, and keeping up with all the major players.  Sad that some had to die, but the last book was basically a war.  Some parts of it were kind of draggy, but that's typical in this series.  I was glad that it came to a decent end.
0743201140|5.0|My work offered this book and topic as a training class.  I really enjoyed the class and then bought a book for a friend as a gift. My son told me his one employer also sent him to training and we shared our strengths with each other.  It is helpful to understand how not only yourself but others around you are what I call &#34;wired&#34;.

B004T32SOK|5.0|I use both Dropbox and Box.  The box offers 5gb free and is really easy to set up and use. Dropbox offers 2 gb free.  The box is definitely worth getting and using. The syncing of files between devices is the best.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book will hold you from the start.  Sparis always has that unknown element at the end.  Would read this on again.
0446580848|4.0|DeMille's way with words continues to be fun!  This novel takes a long time to get into the action but the narrative keeps the reader interested.  A good read but probably not &#34;up there&#34; compared to his previous novels.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I can't believe how well this product works especially for the money. Every artist should own it. A GREAT Toolbox for artists

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Gave an honest view of Chris Kyle's life.He was truly an American hero. His killing was truly tragic especially when he was trying to help fellow veterans.
B005SEXPMS|4.0|Loved the series. Came highly recommended by several family members.  Enjoyed Season 1 the best, then season 2, then season 4.  Wasn't too happy with season 3.  Season 4 was great - losts of twist and why did it have to end that way
B00102F5WK|5.0|you won't forget this one..............early Jake and Reese......Meryl is the ultimate strong woman...a true B****..might have been a pre-Devil wears Prada characterization....not for faint of heart....there IS violence....not gratuitous but leaves no questioning about getting information........scarey idea of governments
B00AH8U3UC|5.0|Enjoyable watching. You feel sympathy for the characters as they go through there self inflicted lows. Money doesn't buy happiness.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Excellent imagination, you wonder what's next . Science or human feelings , ?......... Like the way the family is in focus.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Action packed adventure by your favorite characters from past action movies with a decent story line. A good group of guys who can laugh at them selves.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|I have been listening to reggae since the '80s,and while the Marley' s haven't been the top choice, this documentary was great. It puts his life in review, starting in the trench town slums, through his success as an adult. Of particular interest was how he got the cancer.<br /><br />Great movie
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Not a great fan even though I'm still watching all the episodes. I like the actors, like the detail of how the house works, don't like the story all that much.
B007UXT6T6|3.0|The plots works at capturing your interest, mostly with technical effects. and generally succeeds.  It pleasantly fills some spare time and tries to hook you into the next such movie.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Love playing bingo, but this one lacks instructions (what are the coins and power ups and how do they work) and once you use \\"free\\" tokens you have to buy more???  How free is this app really?<br /><br />Or maybe I am missing something?
B0063IH60K|5.0|It downloaded fast and easy to use. Had it on Kindle for over a year. I enjoy it.Color choices are fun to change the look keep it fresh
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|This novel continues to series involving Pendergast, his brother, and his ward.  The plot contains little that is new and relies too heavily on violent scenes.  Still, this is Preston, and it's worth the money to see him continue the series.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This is a great read and an eye-opener. So many divergent facts pulled together to create a book of generosity and grace. Fascinating to almost anyone!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Probably the best read I've had in years.I could picture many of the episodes in my mind' eye.they should make a movie of this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The anticipation for Downton Abby, Season 3 was almost too great to wait for this ongoing drama.  It was too much to think about the finale which arrived much too soon.
B008PHN6F6|5.0|I always wanted to watch this and now  i finally have.  Well worth the wait!  It could have still been great without all the nudity though...
B003YL4LYI|4.0|We have a few too many characters to keep track of and I want the next book to come out already.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|An excellent cast, an intriguing plot and excellent script.  I love this movie!  However, if one is not into psychological aberrations and/or nudity, this movie is not for you.<br /><br />Everyone in the cast does a phenomenal job!
B0015442YU|2.0|Someone else put it well:  \\"everything is forced and nothing is believable.\\"<br />I loved Silence of the Lambs.  This one has a horrible storyline, worse than most science fiction, terrible acting, & as other reviews have noted, grossness beyond meaning or necessity.<br />The new Starling (Moore) was horrible;  she's colder, less sensitive, less emotional, less of everything that made the 1st Starling great.  To be fair, she has some merit, but, in the scope of a good movie, relatively little.<br />To quote another reviewer: \\"Julianne Moore didn't hold a candle to Jodie Foster in the role of Agent Starling.\\"<br />The only saving grace in this movie, is Hannibal himself (the original Anthony Hopkins) & for his part, I give it 2 stars instead of only 1.<br />See other reviews (1-3*) for more on what makes this worse than the 1st one.<br />A better edited version of this film, with the original Starling would deserve a 4*.<br /> [keeping in such good parts, as H saving her life--a nice touch.]<br />I haven't read the book, but, from those that have, likely it would have been a better ending too.
B005LAII08|5.0|The computer graphics are just amazing.  I love the story too.  Another hit for the team!  I even bought a copy for my niece!
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|This watch arrived very nicely packaged in genuine presentation box.<br />It was running when I opened it.  I set the date and time (very simple) and well explained in the instruction book.<br />  I needed a watch with a luminesant second hand and I wanted an automatic.  The Lum. is easy to see and glows all night even with limited exposure proir to dark.  The watch looks simple and professional.  I've had it about a week, and checked it against a atomic clock so far, it has gained only a few seconds.<br />  For $192.00 you can't go wrong with this timepeice.  It looks great, and if it gets lost or broken (Always a concern when you work in EMS)  your not out a huge sum of money.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I am really enjoying this book.  There are a lot of things to consider.  Change is hard but worth doing it.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|This game is very whack and cheap looking I like flo and I LOVE diner dash. I'm a dash addict but this game didn't do it for me not 1 bit' but hey it was only $0.99.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series has what most series lack these days...character building.  I like that they focus on the characters and not on the instant gratification of sexual acts.  The acting is superb!  I can't wait for season 4.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book is well written and is easy to read. The story is a realistic look at mental illness, with humor and wit mixed in.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I love apps that are easy to use. This is one of them. Nice to be able to have text, drawings, and attachments. Too bad it does not show them all on the same page like on a paper notebook, where I can write, draw, and tape a piece of paper on the same page. Would like to see such a feature in future.
B006ZPJWBM|3.0|this was good but not great. If you are a Tony Bennett fan it is certainly enjoyable but I have the CD and I prefer it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love it. Its a fun game plus you are feeding candy to an adorable little monster named Om Nom.Om Nom is the most adorable little thing in the world.Did I mention he LOVES candy. This game is fun challenging and adorable. I totally recommend this game. P.S.if you read this check out Om Nom stories on youtube and on the OmNom website
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think subway suffers was a fun game and all unroll it erased all my progress. I am not a huge fan of the Rio theme or whatever either
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Thought it was interesting and informative but at the end it went a liitle flat. I will still will recommend the book to friends.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|horrible app it brings you to the starting page and then just goes to the home screen again and again
0811879542|5.0|This book is great! I love how interactive it is and it gets lots of giggles out of many kids. I will be buying this for gifts in the future.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|best app ever!! this game is so fun to play this is a must get app. this app is. so fun and easy. to use have fun
0307352153|4.0|As an introvert, I felt pretty validated by this book. Nothing's wrong with me, hooray! Now I just need to get everyone I know who's an extrovert to read it, too...
B0039PPW60|5.0|This is a perfect mixer for the &#34;small act&#34; live musician. I play/sing guitar with vocals with up to two accompanying musicians. This mixer allows me to play an acoustic guitar with pickup to go directly through the mixer with wonderful effects - or - I can mic my amp for my Tele. I can run multiple mics for drums, bass or vocals. I also have the ability to record live. This works wonderfully with my Alto 15&#34; 2 way powered speakers for either indoor or outdoor events. It is really easy to program and set up. If one has questions concerning its operation - and we all do - a call to Behringer's customer service takes care of the unknowns in a flash! Their technicians are friendly, knowledgeable and &#34;spot on&#34; for solving/answering any concerns you may have. I couldn't be more pleased!
B0072OFOM6|4.0|While I found season 1 to be the best so far, Liam does a fine job of taking the helm. The fight is still urgent and survival is never guaranteed. The characters are developing wonderfully and you find yourself invested in each one no matter how fleeting their time on screen. Everytime Asher appeared I found myself yelling, \\"Someone kill this @#$/^&* already.\\" Like I said, I was invested in the character it just so happened to mean this one's death.
0345803507|5.0|I am still reading this book, I read the first and second one.  I am not as interested in this one as I was the others. Although still good, and it is the last one to end the story so it is also a must read.
B0087240Z4|2.0|It's pretty bad.  My theory - Billy started Smashing Pumpkins with James Iha and D'arcy and they make three of the greatest albums of rock - Gish, Siamese Dream, and Mellon Collie.  For this reason, I will always love Smashing Pumpkins.  These three albums alone make the Smashing Pumpkins deserving of all their greatness and glory.<br /><br />However, it seems that Billy Corgan became delusional at some point in the late 90s and believed that the success of these 3 albums were all due to his effort.  True, the band was due mostly to his effort, but I believe James' more sensitive and soft style definitely contributed to their sound.  The result? The band becomes all about Billy Corgan and less about James and D'arcy.  Billy suddenly changes from collaborator to megalomaniac.  They break up and Billy reforms Smashing Pumpkins some years later.<br /><br />The catch, however, is that Billy only brings along band members that will never doubt him or his songwriting direction.  Honestly, they'd probably be too afraid to given Billy's reputation.  So, any new members, I imagine, are looking to go along for the Smashing Pumpkins ride while Billy does whatever he wants.  Promoters and music labels cash in on the Smashing Pumpkins brand, and band members shut up and let master Billy take the reigns.<br /><br />Then comes Zeitgeist and this new album Oceania.  Guitars are way over-processed.  They sound like they go through a bunch of pedals and then a digital processor.  Guitars sound way too compressed while Billy's voice never has the same soft and vulnerable tone it did in the old days.  Now, it's all a rough screech.  Solos are not as well thought-out, as if the effects could make up for the lack of consideration.  Honestly, this album makes me sad considering what SP once were back in the day.
0345803485|5.0|I would tell everyone to read this book, you will love.  I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A great book for those who enjoy fictional books about adventure, warfare, magic, and (medieval) politics.<br /><br />Compared to the first book (Game of Thrones), this book stood out to me in that EVERYTHING that could have possible gone wrong, did go wrong. In the first book, there are two main forces (Starks and Lannisters), but in the second book there are 4+ main forces, and traitors within each of those forces that further break up those forces. It makes me feel like there's no hope for anyone. Can't wait to read the third book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The gold shoe,magnetic,the coins are so cool the app is the most coolest app I got I hope u guys love it too. Subway surfers should be the best-selling app in stores my cousin got me hooked to it . People ,Pepsi,Love!!!!!!!!!
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, Helen Hunt was really good. It is a very interesting story that you definitely don't see every day. It is so hard to imagine how he could live his life in an iron lung and never really have love until he was well into adulthood. I'm glad I saw it and I would recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book now is the time to be reading this but I am . Why am<br /><br />I HAVING TROUBLE EXITING THIS REVIEW.<br /><br />Would like to get back to reading this book NOW.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Don't be put off from reading this novel because it has been chosen by many book clubs. Sometimes there is a good reason for this.<br />Gone Girl is a surprise: it's a well written book that introduces you to characters and sets up a framework and then proceeds to slice and dice that framework so that you are forced to decide what is real and what is true. Think of it as a psychological mystery that will keep you turning the page. This is not &#34;chick-lit&#34; at all.  It is well written, insightful, suspenseful and entertaining.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|My kid loves this movie, and it's something that adults can enjoy, too. The visuals are gorgeous, and then there's Maggie Smith (the British Gene Hackman, who's fun to watch in anything).
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Manayunk (PA) Book Club Selection for February 2013:  The author attempted to craft a magical tale of love and sacrifice but failed to create characters that the reader really came to understand and care about.  The book began with promise but left me with more questions than answers and I really didn't care to know what the answers were when it was all said and done.  *Kanye Shrug*
B009C7JS14|5.0|Because I can get my local weather in Astoria, Oregon.I use lots now  and I like the design too. Thank you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THEY GAME IS Amazing, you can build what ever you want or fight to survive against the hostile mobs of the night.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I like it when I saw my friend use it .I like use for my bank statement or for bowling .
B0050DIWFC|4.0|enjoyed the authors development of characters and it all came together at the end of the novel.<br />I would recommend this book to other readers.
B009G8GRX6|2.0|Muse has been making a habit of disappointing albums and this one is no different. Gone are most of the glamour and pomp of their last release, 2009's The Resistance, and instead what is left behind is a stale and lifeless exersice. The few tracks that stand out, Supremacy and Madness, can do little to save the remaining 11 tracks.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|growing up with the series, has be a plus . but watching the newer episode has bee just as much fun and can't wait for the next episode on March 30th.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I fell in love with Sky and Holder. This book was a real page turner that I couldn't put down. There were many great twists throughout the book. The romance aspect was fun. I felt like maybe it was for a slightly younger audience than myself (I'm 35). It was worth the money.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Just buy it....you'll be glad you did.  Good strategy the elements change every game.  I recommend the 5-6 player expansion.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I thought this movie was good but I thought the timing of it was way to long for the story line.
B005ELZKWS|2.0|I admit I am not a fan of Sammy's voice or song writing, but I did enjoy the debut.  In comparison, the songs on III are bland and forgettable.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I've seen this album all over the place and decided to pull the trigger.  I was really surprised at how great an album this was, from start to finish.<br /><br />To me this sounded like an album of songs that would have been great in any era.  I can easily picture Michael Jackson putting out this album after 'Thriller' and people eating it up.<br /><br />For me the big selling point is the consistency of the songs.  All of them are high quality, catchy and flow throughout the album.  To paraphrase Michael Stipe: &#34;there are no turds in the bowl.&#34;
B006UG909U|5.0|I first heard Van Halen when Women and Children First came out.  After all these years, I didn't think they could pull it off...I was wrong.<br />I am admittedly biased in that I prefer Roth over Hagar.  With Roth, VH was a fun party band.  Hagar turned them political, serious and commercial.  Roth brings the band back to party status.  Some of the songs remind me of their early years, while others are more mature but keep the original VH sound.<br />I had many of the songs stuck in my head by the second time I played the CD.  Not many bands can do that anymore.<br />Welcome back, Van Halen.  I missed you guys.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Streaming has hung up a few times but I think it is my DSL line speed.<br />Would love it if I could get a faster speed.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I read this on a long plane ride cross-country one day. I was literally laughing out loud! I love Ellen and her witty and sometimes deadpan, sarcastic humor. I think the people on the plane thought I was nuts, but I didn't care. I was enjoying the book too much!
B008VBYN80|3.0|To maintain enjoyable gameplay a constant supply of game diamonds are needed. These diamonds price the game beyond that of a full graphic online rpg or alike. Bring the price down and I believe you would gain more subscribers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|No matter how sophisticated games become, it does not beat the entertainment value of solitary. Cool game. It never gets old.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I first saw this film on a friends large screen in Blueray. The images, colour and music are stunning.  I would also recommend POWAQQATSI and KOYAANISQATSI.
B00821OX98|5.0|Although some of the story lines get to be a bit redundant (what series doesn't suffer from these?!), overall the acting, stories, and special effects combine to make this a compelling TV experience. Interesting plot twists help keep the story alive. There's even a different take on the &#34;Stockholm Syndrome.&#34; Racism has gone away but xenophobia is certainly rampant. Who can you trust? When is a hero not a hero and a villain less than a villain? I was definitely interested in seeing Season 2.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Amazon does a great job of helping their customers. My original cord crumbled and they gave me a GC for the amount of a new cord! Thanks Amazon!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Having used some iOS weather apps (granted, on a iPhone or iPod Touch, you have a much smaller screen!), I really like this app. I get an instant overview of the weather, I can look ahead at the forecast, and I can look at maps, etc. Like all weather apps and forecasts, you have to take the information with a grain of salt, because it's amazing how often they're wrong.
1615239502|4.0|This was a book club selection. I am the only man in our Church book club group and I m curious what women find interesting to read about.It is not a subject I find interesting otherwise. I do appreciate the large print, and the chance to buy the book as used. I thought the book was in good condition for being &#34;used&#34;.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|can't. stop playing my son is addicted ! really enjoy wish there were more obstacles to go thru. looking forward to next levels
B0049VZ222|3.0|Falling Skies is much better.  It's just walking dead people.  Over and over and over.  'Sorry I paid for it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love all these games. This is hours of entertainment and I like being able to go back and earn points on levels I've already beaten
B0040I09RM|3.0|When 1st season was on TV, I was watching another series at that time slot.  Glad I got to catch up on the back story to the episodes I've watched.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was my first read by Nicholas Sparks, I've seen a handful of movies, and I can already say this book was so amazing! I loved the characters and I didn't want it to end. There were so many beautiful details and towards the end, so much suspense. I loved it! Can't wait to read another by Sparks.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I read this short story in one night. I could not put it down. Will Smith does no justice to the Robert Neville in this book. Anyone who enjoys a good horror/vampire/apocalyptic story should read this. Wonderfully written.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The only thing I wish this would have is an easier interface. Still I don't think it's too big of a deal, I just perfer simplicity.
B0034G4P80|3.0|With K. Branagh as director and co-starring Anthony Hopkins, I really believed this was worth the effort. Alas, it is 2 hours you'll never get back again. Natalie is pretty as always, but this is no Black Swan. The SFX are fine (a bit over the top), but unless you're a Marvel Comics fan, don't expect to hear an Academy Award screenplay or see top notch acting. Branagh should stick to Shakespeare...
B0091REZMW|4.0|I do like the game but the gremlin type things have thrown me for a loop.  Not sure how to get rid of them without using all my loot and I run out of health too quick.  I think there should be better instruction.  I also realize that even free games come with a price, but let's not be so greedy.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Although this book is fiction, with the recent spate of hacking going on, it seems almost prophetic.  Scary, to say the least.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Easy to install and use, it like having a pc format.  Easy to setup to add book marks. It was free
B003L7DK6U|5.0|Perfect, came brand new.  It had lots of extras and is FULL of interviews and behind the scenes!  Bruce Lee is Awesome!!!
B000TS99I2|5.0|Best movie by Robert DeNiro! Phenomenal performance by everyone such a touching story i cried and laughed i felt every moment within the movie. i loved it !
B009YVBZO6|1.0|Tried many stations and did not work. Have app on iPhone and works alright so what is the problem with this ver on the kindleHD ???  Maybe Amazon should get updates or contact app developer to fix problem!!
B004HA29K8|5.0|This book is a must-have if you enjoy craft beer.  Even though you've learned and enjoyed tasting all the different styles, you need to understand the brewing process.<br /><br />Even though I elected standard shipping, the book also arrived in less than 48 hours after I ordered it and in excellent condition.  The seller packaged it well to prevent shipping damage.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Loved it since i was a child, now im reading it to mine.<br />I will say that Jack London will always be a favorite of mine.
B005ARYEY6|5.0|This recording was terrific and, in my opinion, represents Miles at his best. No need to say more. The DVD just added one more bonus to this fantastic package.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My son found this game. I end up playing it more than him. I like using strategies and making many coins fall at once.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm surprised that Gale was there and saved prim and katniss mother and said there isn't a district 12 I'm like what the fudge and their plan was to save peeta that's all they can do to owe him?I'm like save yourself if I was katniss she is so sensitive so she gives her life up for a guy wow............well if he's dead they never owed him so they do make a point! I'm such a obsessed hunger gamer plz read this
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I haven't read a book in a long time. I tried the sample of this book and then bought it and read it within a few days. I loved hearing the thoughts that were going on Pat People's (the main character) mind. So honest and real, especially if you understand anxiety and depression. Very funny and heartwarming. Don't miss it.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|The Dark Shadows soap opera was before my time, but I've been a Burton fan since Pee Wee's Big Adventure.<br />Dark Shadows is Tim Burton in the now: tongue in cheek, highly stylish but without much substance. There are<br />chuckles throughout but in the end, it left me wanting something more. Depp is great, per usual. Michelle Pfeiffer<br />is good. I just didn't really care about what happened to any of the characters.<br /><br />Dark Shadows is worth a watch, but come to it with low expectations.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|.....it,s. very easy to learn to play and score coins and also to operate very easy hand movements you will love playing it
B004GJ1XU2|4.0|The Big Chill is a great film. I've always known about it for its sound track (which is a great collection of classic<br />R&B and Rock & Roll). Some how I have missed seeing it and am really glad I finally watched.<br />The story revolves around a group of college friends who reunite for a weekend after one of the people<br />in their circle passes away. The themes are timeless, and the acting was authentic. At no point did I feel<br />that these characters are out of place. Each character deals with the loss in their own way, but they don't<br />have to do it alone.<br /><br />This film also reflects its time period. If this film were made today, I'm afraid it would be filled with cynical people,<br />bickering amongst each other and passing blame. The Big Chill never devolves to that. This film presents a<br />genuine group of friends, caring for each other in a time of need.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I felt Argo was a great movie in that it tells the true story of the difference one man can make in the lives of others.  Stories like this should inspire us, usually not in the grand way of this situation, but in our own small ways, to think beyond ourselves and impact the lives of others.  I was also impressed with the acting, and that such closely resembling actors were chosen to portray the six hostages.  I lived through this whole ordeal while in college and being friends with foreign exchange students from Iran, whose fathers worked in the embassy of the Shah.  While they were on our campus, the Shah was overturned, and their lives were dramatically changed.  It was very eye-opening to see what was happening on the other side at this time.  Great movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|loved it. It was very well written and was a nice simple read. Looking forward to eventually seeing the movie. Although I doubt it will live up to the book.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|The team really comes into it's own in season 6. All the pieces are now in place for the final showdown with Anubis.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A bizarre story filled with animal insights. I love the way the author writes and the depth of the<br /> character Pi.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|I love this show, I will be sad when its over :-( Always entertaining. Keeps me laughing and I love their brotherly bond.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Keith has already lived a 500 year lifetime. His love of music and of people has enriched not only his life but those fortunate people who had the opportunity to know him. I wish I had the good fortune to sit with guitars and spend an afternoon getting to know this musician of the world.  After reading this book I feel I know Keith Richards and I respect the man, HIS music, and life. I hope Keith remains with us for another 500 years. Never stop living, Keith.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I had high hopes after hearing how well it did in the theater. I was expecting another James Bond movie.....but this one fell woefully and surprisingly short. To the point if it came on TV I wouldn't even bother watching it again. Seemed lacking in plot. They tried to make it deep with the concept of Bond aging and the relationship between him and M, yet with the tackiness of the bad guy, and the bad guy's bad dye job....his hair oh my goodness! Why dye a guys hair that blonde when you can see his facial hair is practically black?? Looked horrific. And then the hilariousness of when Bond gets shot on the train in the beginning, like anyone's upper torso wouldn't be blown to bits with a bullet from that range, or at least have a good chunk missing....and they never did explain how he didn't bleed out or have a major artery or blood vessel severed. You'd have to have someone pull you out of the water immediately, and try to stop the bleeding then medevac them to a hospital by helicopter.....then the holes with the IT technology side of it. Like Q wouldn't know by hooking up the bad guys computer to their network they wouldn't expose themselves to a virus when they are dealing with a guy who hacked their network earlier?? Seriously? Please what is this kindergarten? A far better more realistic movie Id watch over and over again is the new Bourne movie. The Bourne Legacy.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I liked this game. It was hard enough to stay interesting but not to get frustrating. The story line had quite the twist at the end
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This is a nice guide for forgetful me.  I always have a set of exercises<br />when I am just hanging out.  No wasted time thinking abut what to do<br />or for how long or how many.<br />Would reccommend to anyone.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Addictive and enthralling, my husband and I cannot get enough!  The twists and turns keep wanting more, best show ever.
B00866H7SS|5.0|I read the fifty shades of grey trilogy then everyone was saying read bared to you its better.....<br />I now believe Bared to You is better, I love the secrets and the love they share and the stuff they go through to stay together. I could read it over and over.
B0041KVZ1I|3.0|I absolutely love this album. It's probably my favorite Beatles album of the moment. The only problem is, I had to buy the same album 3 times. The first two times I bought it at Urban Outfitters in the store. The first one skipped in one spot on Come Together, which could have been my fault, but it was also skipping horribly on Because on side two which I am 100% positive I did not cause. The second one was fine on side one but side two skipped multiple times on every song. The guy at UO said they probably just got a bad batch and suggested that I buy one somewhere else. I have bought two other records on Amazon that were perfect so I thought I would try buying this one here too. I have listened to the record one time and it already skips a few times on Here Comes the Sun. I have decided to keep the album instead of buying a fourth one since it only skips on one song. I would give the album itself 10 stars if I could, I love it so much. Unfortunately since I had to buy it three times just to get one that was acceptable, I gave it 3 stars. It is so disappointing that such an amazing album would have such bad manufacturing.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Such a good Nicholas Sparks book. It has elements of love and romance he is so well known for as well as an air of mystery and gripping suspense. Definitely a few unexpected twists and interesting viewpoint changes that really completed the novel. Katie is a fantastic character as well. She has a strong air to her and the unveiling of her inner self adds to the story wonderfully. This is a great book for anyone looking for a love story with dark and suspenseful elements. This is one that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B002ZBJ6SY|5.0|I'm a big Seether fan so it's a given that I love this CD. If you like early 90's alt rock grunge, you'll love this CD by Seether.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|For those of you who are addicted to autobiographies like me should definitely get this book!! Look inside the mind of one of the worlds greatest bassist. Nikki Sixx is a genius in his own words. GET THIS BOOK,...NOW!!
B00138KKP8|4.0|Great CD to listen all the way from start to finish. Went to a Dave Matthews show and Ray opened up for them. They were great live and the CD is great too. I recommend it to people who like Dave.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 5 year old plays this game on his kindle and on my phone he loves playing this game when we go out on long trips....
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I feel like this series just has very likable charecters and there is a women captain who is likable. And using real historical figures like Amelia airport is fun.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|When I rented this movie it stated that it was for 30 day rental and it was only good for one day My son wanted to see it again the next day and it did not work it asked for another payment to rent again...  NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT!!!
B00526ZKYS|4.0|A \\"can't put it down\\" kind of book.  Great love story for those hopeless romantics out there.  A must read!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|If you liked the X Files you'll like Fringe. Quirky characters and bizarre plots makes Fringe a lot of fun. Not for the squeamish though, it can get pretty gory and times. No episode is complete without an autopsy.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I own all of his recordings, saw him in Anahiem and he was thrilling!  Lovely sexy voice and such a sweet man.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Despite the quality of the acting, the special effects were over used and relied on too much.  They were  the same old &#34;jerky scary kid&#34; tired &#34;The Ring&#34; effects that have been used to death.  The writing was pretty good, but the demon was much more frightening than the creepy kids and should have been explored more and figured more prominently.  &#34; Insidious&#34; was much better.  Some other movies I can recommend that are much better attempts at this sort of horror film are of course &#34;The Ring&#34;, &#34;Pulse&#34; (The U.S. Version), &#34;Drag Me to Hell&#34;, &#34;The Unborn&#34;, &#34;The Shrine&#34;, and a wonderful new Hammer Film production; &#34;Wake Wood&#34;.
1451695187|4.0|I can't personally remark on this book because I gave it as a present. However, my bother is hard to buy for and showed 'almost' excitement having received it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is fantastic.  It's an &#34;intelligent & modest&#34; soap opera.  You don't need the sex glaring at you like it does in &#34;American&#34; soap operas.  There is substance and a a historical look at the elite of British society.
0316067938|3.0|She enjoys this series.  The book was a Christmas present, she was delighted, with this gift.  No problems with the book.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I have bought a lot of LED puck lights in the past as I am a sucker for these lights.  The technology have gone more advanced and now you can purchase them with more technology for the buck.  This puck light houses 8 LED lights.  It is one of the brightest I have seen.  It uses 4 AA batteries (I would advice to get rechargeable batteries becuase even LEDs that consume much less energy would still need batteries to be replaced from time to time).<br /><br />It includes a pair of screws (and gypsum board attachment) for mounting.  The sensors are very responsive.  It works by sensing light, heat and motion.  I thought it was not working at first when I realized that there was enough light in the room.  When I placed it in a dark spot, then it start working as it should.  Also remember that it will not turn off if placed close to a furnace or  a supply vent that blows hot air.  The light will not turn off because of the heat thinking it is sensing a human being.<br /><br />This puck light is very capable.  I like it and would easily recommend it.<br /><br />Sample item was provided by the distributor for an evaluation review.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game and have several friends that we ply it frequently,  It is much fun and entertaining. Good,
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is one of my favorite books so far in 2013.  I will not tell the whole story here but I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed Cheryl's journey.  I originally resisted reading this book \\"about hiking;\\" however, I am so glad I gave it a chance.  Yes, there are a lot of times in the book you think \\"wow...she didn't plan or investigate very well...\\" but that's what made it more real.  More fun.  As I read this book I thought \\"wow, she just took off on this journey.\\"  She was a free bird....how liberating and crazy and fun!  I would HIGHLY recommend this book.  Loved it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Ok but not too my satisfaction.  It's the same as if I played with a deck of cards,  I don't use it much.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is the second book I have read by this author! Really enjoyed the surprise in the end!!! Hope she keeps writing!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider.  I play this a lot.  I try to complete it but don't always succeed. Nice game to play
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was a great return to his old style of keeping the reader very involved in what was going on in the book. I enjoyed the book very much!
0880796863|5.0|Love this tarot pack. I am a new to tarot, so this is a great combination. The only complaint I have is that the book is kind of small, I wish it was bigger.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|I grew up with the Transformers. I know how they look, sound, and act.  The first Transformers REALLY disappointed me. So on this one I took a more objective view at it. Instead of finding faults and comparing to the Cartoons I loved. I looked at it as a total new thing. It helped out some. The story line was good and it had plenty of action.  I'm still disappointed about some features and looks.. If it wasn't for that I would have given it 4 stars.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|Liked it a lot!  I enjoy all the Jack Ryan novels.  I also like all the \\"Six\\" characters.<br /><br />More to come I hope!
B0098460O4|5.0|I loved watching these two on Brittan's Got Talent. I followed them all the way and now own the CD. I love the CD and love hearing them sing. Of course like all music. You have to like this style of music.. so not everyone will enjoy it like  I do. So yeah.. my 5 star could be considered a little bias.
B008476HBM|5.0|I read the Jane Austen books about once every 5 years.  I never fail to love them.  Excellent writting, great character development and a wonderful story.
B001W2D6N8|5.0|What's not to like? Neils' second album with Crazy Horse. A classic with one on his best songs ever Cortez the killer.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I choose a 10 out of 5. I choose this because the book is full of adventure and excitement, it has some emotional moments too. I love the story ethic. It is not like the movie so if you've seen the movie you can still read the book. I would recommend this book for maybe 3-5 or people with lots of imagination. I say this because you have to know how to read and you can kinda make up pictures in your head.<br /><br />  Happy readings:):):):)!!!!<3<3<3<3
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a good game to play u should play it what i like about it is that u  can feed it and keep feeding i love to feed him and i love to clean up like the poop and the flowers
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is the first book I've read that wasn't written by Stephen king. I was pleasantly surprised that it was easy to read and I was hooked fairly quick. I will be looking for more books by this author.
B00683JK9K|5.0|Very easy to use and a fun way to spend some time when the weather is nasty outside.  I like how you can change the level of difficulty even though I mostly stuck with the easiest level.  Love the beautiful scenes.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Sinks very good with all my devices, the only problem is at times the pages hang  up and won't advance to the next page, but it has only happened a couple of times in one book only.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|I liked this movie because it helps us to remember our past so we can learn from our mistakes and not make the same ones again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The over all picture ie great.My little sister loves to play this game on my phone. My daughter also likes to watch my little sister play the game.
B0026BD2GK|4.0|This is how it all started for SANTANA. You get to compare their first album to their live WOODSTOCK performance--song for song.You get a great studio album + a fabulous live performance at the biggest concert ever. It's hard to find whole sets from that concert. But here it is and the great album that started it...If you like SANTANA---THIS is a must .
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Strategy, humor, probably lots of real fragments.  Held my interest.  Not something that most fiction accomplishes.  Will read more DeMille books.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This Is like the most addicting game EVER!!!!!  The spike balls look hard but it really is easy. Don't mess up in the mine!!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Child's Reacher books run the gamut from mediocre to great.  This one is in the middle, maybe leaning to the positive side.  The situation is somewhat confined, which takes away from the usual Reacher stories.  That may be what kept me from giving this one four stars.<br /><br />Good read, but one you can put down and pick up again later.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|one of the best on tv it never fails to be suspenseful.would recommend you watch this show if you've never seen it you will love it
B0000041DF|5.0|A review I read recently by Santa Fe Listener referenced this recording, and since I didn't have Argerich playing any Rachmaninov (and since I had just been impressed by her Prokofiev/Ravel disc from 1966), I went out and bought it.  Well, I wasn't disappointed in the playing -- two live performances of two warhorse concertos, two years apart in the early 1980's, with good conductors at the helm.  The Rachmaninoff Third is marvelously played -- Argerich is totally engaged, and both the lyrical and the virtuoso stuff are hers to command.  A few weeks ago I had been impressed by Thibaudet and Ashkenazy in this concerto, so I hauled it out for comparison.  Thibaudet plays marvelously, but no better than Argerich.  What WAS better in Thibaudet's recording was the recorded sound and the balance between piano and orchestra.  For Argerich, Chailly and the Berlin RSO were too far back in the picture, with the result that the textures of the orchestra and its sense of interacting with the soloist were muted -- a great pity when Argerich was on her game, as she was here.  I admit that live performances might be tricky to record, but Hyperion did a better job for Stephen Hough and Andrew Litton for their live Rachmaninov series from Dallas (another good one).  The same limitation was true of the Tchaikovsky -- and here my comparison was Argerich's later live recording from Berlin with Abbado.  It was night and day -- the Argerich/Abbado Tchaikovsky First is one of the great concerto recordings of all time for me.
B0081336FO|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from a British tv show but this has surprised me! I am upset they only do 3 episodes for a season, maybe that's their plan for the viewers to want more and more. This show reminds me of the American show Lie to Me. But give it a try
B000001GS4|5.0|Forget Argerich for the moment.  I have never heard Abbado so totally involved in Tchaikovsky's music as he seems to be in this recording.  I say that partly out of disappointment with the sound of Abbado's 6-disc Sony box of the symphonies, released quite recently -- and the problem there might just be the sound, because in other respects the performances seem fine.  Here, though, from a live concert in the Philharmonie in Berlin, DG has given both soloist and orchestra as good sound as I've ever heard for a live recording of a big piece -- and better than some studio recordings!  The result is that you hear the relation between the piano and orchestra as interaction and not just foreground/background, AND, even better, in the long first movement, you hear the interaction, the dramatic give-and-take, WITHIN the orchestra -- and that makes a huge difference to one's perception of the interestingness of that first movement.  Also you can hear and appreciate the different textures of the different orchestral groupings, and you can hear the breadth of the soloist's tonal palette.  All of that is what's missing in Argerich's other live recording of the Tchaikovsky First, with Kondrashin in 1982.  It's a fine performance but the orchestra is back in the aural picture and you just don't hear all there is to hear.  And Argerich's fine playing in that recording is made more monochrome by the engineers' failure to do justice to her tonal resources.  But the superiority of this version with Abbado isn't just a matter of sound -- Abbado is phrasing and transitioning and connecting in much more interesting ways than Kondrashin, with, as one result, some real wit and humor coming across in the second and third movements.  Now -- back to Argerich: she was 51 when she recorded this and I don't see any diminution of her powers -- she can thunder, she can sing, she can do the limpid stuff, and the fast passagework and the cadenzas are just marvelously dispatched.  One of the great recordings of any concerto, I would say.ecordings of any concerto, I would say.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Bought the full game awhile ago - forums suggest the Hoth update came out last November? I have played through all of Tatoinne and Death Star - but still no option for Hoth (free or to buy)? Any help/unlock codes?
B002DZX94Y|5.0|I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense to worry about whether Martha Argerich is the greatest living pianist or the sixth-greatest.  The point is simply that she's almost always worth hearing, whether in a concerto, solo, or a chamber piece.  The records of hers that I don't care as much for are usually in less-than-good sound quality and balance, and my reservations are not really about the playing at all.  In this box, the sound is never less than acceptable and usually much more than that -- the digital stuff is actually pretty stellar, and the Tchaikovsky live performance with Abbado is as great a performance and recording as you'll hear anywhere.  But even the 1966-67 stuff sounds good -- at least on my equipment.  The Ravel from 1966 is magical, and Abbado's accompaniments in those early days to Prokofiev, Ravel, Chopin, and Liszt are attentive and engaging in its own right.  The early Tchaikovsky recording with Dutoit is fine too, and Rostropovich and Sinopoli contribute to performances of Beethoven and Schumann that sound good.  The comparisons between the Sinopoli-accompanied Beethoven and the Abbado-accompanied Beethoven are really interesting, for both are distinguished  recordings.  My point isn't that these are the only recordings of these concertos worth having -- though if they're all you can afford, they're good choices -- but simply that they are really good and really worth hearing -- AND at about only $4.00 a disc!  Just go for it.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I love love love this CD. I wasn't aware that it had already been 10 years Kelly Clarkson had been singing.  WOW<br /><br />I loved the music.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This is my second reading, more than 20 years after the first, and I find the book this time even more fascinating. I was first attracted to it because of the archetypical physical appearance of the Overlords and the device of waiting more than 50 years before showing themselves to humans. Though written in 1950, I was struck by the sheer volume of the intriguing ideas presented and its speculations about the future. Some aspects of the picture of 21st Century earth it paints are accurate (hundreds of TV channels, for instance) but many are not. In the book, they have flying cars but no personal computers or internet. Computers are huge. Every home or office has a fax machine that pumps out news reports throughout the day, so no idea of a paperless office. There is no synergy between computers and television. No e-books (except the one I'm reading it on). The miniaturization of so many machines and components doesn't happen here. People still smoke with no apparent concerns about or even knowledge of health risks. No female Overlord characters. This is another sci-fi novel predicting a 20-hour work week in the 21st Century (ha-ha). These are just a few of the thought-provoking notions explored. I think this novel is a Book Club's dream. There are so many points that could lead to great discussions, a club could spend a year of meetings getting through every thing worth discussing in this book. This book provides a rare abundance of brain stimulation. I recommend it to everyone.
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|Season one was great but this one is terrible. I wish I would have saved my money. Dont waste your time.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I'm so impressed...<br /><br />Justin Hayward and his MOODY BLUES sound are brought to this album even more so than with his last album (View From A Hill).  There's a MESSAGE being sent in this album and I'm still trying to understand it but I would suspect it is the final album/CD from Mr. Hayward.<br /><br />It's a tribute in a sense; somewhat GHOSTLY at times but SPIRITS OF THE WESTERN SKY is excellent listening for all of us MOODIES fans and for those of us who have waited for VIEW FROM A HILL-Part 2.<br /><br />Thank you Justin for continuous smiles of pride and choice over the decades of your stunning music, talent and for never giving up your unique sound.

B009HEN9DU|4.0|I likd the action and romance in this movie. Great actors throughout the moview made it worth watching! Liked it.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I am sorry I saw this movie because I was so disappointed.  The director and the writers took this classic love story and totally destroyed it. Everyone connected with this movie, including the star, should be ashamed of themselves.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|a friend recommended I see this and i'm glad she did. some of it was painful to watch, but very heart opening.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I always enjoy Andrea Bocellis's music but for some reason this latest effort seemed to have something extra going for it. I was pleasantly surprised to hear him singing with Edith Piaf.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Easy to use and quick to start.  Notifies me when mail is available.  Display is easy to use and has the necessary options.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|This is a movie I was skeptical about buying because I so enjoyed the Jason Bourne Trilogy with Matt Damon. What I liked is that it was not Jason Bourne, but was about another member of Treadstone . I also liked how it was tied in to the other movies. Not as gritty and intense as the other three movies, but it did offer plenty of action and a good story line. Jeremy Renner did a good job with his part and I can easily see this continuing forward into additional movies...
1616550414|5.0|My son loves this book!  I was very impressed with the quality of this book, its even nicer in person.
B00B2QA646|1.0|I bought this movie thinking it was going to be a qualiy epic based on the novel. I am a fan of both Keira Knightly and Jude Law. But this movie I turned it off after 20 minutes, probably 10 minutes longer than I should have gone, hoping it was going to get better. Not sure if it was supposed to be a movie, a comedy or a play. Whatever it was I will never watch it again...
B00005TQKQ|5.0|Works perfect.  I've used several times.  It has been very useful.  I have several camaras 8mm and really works. Thanks
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had heard of Downton Abbey and by watching season 1 and 2 on my Kindle I was able to catch up and now am hooked on this program.  Can't wait for season 4 to start.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|You can't do much on the Kindle Fire with it, you lose your coins after you reach 3,000 coins. This app should be debugged.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Life is too depressing to read sad books--in other words I, like Pat, try to read only the books and watch only the movies with endings that celebrate life's silver linings. And while this choice makes finding books and movies exceedingly difficult, the ones to be found, like this one, reward the effort.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Awesome series! Anybody that likes the percy jackson series will love this series! Full of action and drama... it really stole my heart
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I completed levels 1-5 & 8 but difficulty completing 6, 7 & 9. I don't understand that - so bizarre!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellant book!I coujldn't put it down and once finished when right to the next one in the series.I'm on the final book now.You just can't put. Them down once you start reading them
B009G78EE2|5.0|This album is just so incredibly amazing. So many great songs. The lyrics are so insane. Listening to the album has made me fall in love with Macklemore. If I could compare this album based on style and sound, it would be B.O.B. ” strange clouds”. But this album is way better.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Once I started playing I could barely put it down! lol... This a very fun and thought provoking game. Full of puzzles to make you think.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|We bought this for our 5 yr old daughter for Christmas who loves fashion.  There are plenty of pages and reusable stickers to choose from.  The price is GREAT for what you get! This gave her the opportunity to be her own fashion designer from head to toe.  The only thing she would've liked was to have jewelry stickers to complete her designer master pieces. Personally this would've been great if it were in a spiral form book because with all of the turning back and forth the pages began to fall out.  It's not so bad because now it makes it easier for her to just sort through the pages versus flipping back & forth to get to the sticker pages.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Really like this puzzle game. It is very entertaining and relaxing to play. I love to play it while watching tv
B008476HBM|5.0|After having seen the Colin Firth movie version so many times, I was excited to start reading the book. I was not disappointed in the least. Romance in a pure form - I hated to see it end!
B003LSTK8G|4.0|Interesting viewpoint on the financial crisis in the mortgage market.  Told from the perspective of several investors who anticipated the crisis.
B005CW5E3E|4.0|Really enjoyed this cd of Johnny's. Saw him live last year at the Memphis in May Beale st. Music Festival and he did not look so good. Had to walk him out and he sat on a chair, but he could still jam. Great to hear him again with some friends on the cd. Never sounded better.
1401235166|4.0|I've been reading Fables for about five years now, and that has given me some perspective. This volume is stronger than the low point of the Great Fables Crossover (which almost made me quit reading Fables all together) and volumes five and seven. It is not as good as number ten. It is squarely in the middle good but not great. I think the development of the cubs is interesting and I appreciate the return of certain old friends, I also like the development of Spratt. I just feel like this volume is designed to set-up further installments. That being said, I can't wait to see where it goes.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This is hands down my favorite Steven Spielberg movie! I received my order in wonderful condition and it plays beautifully. For anyone who is a big fan of the first Jurassic Park film and not too crazy about the sequels, I highly recommend the collector's edition because it has a lot of  extra content.
B001ENS0BI|5.0|I watched the Prison Break series from the start on tv, it has been the only show on tv that my husband and I watched together. I love that I can watch it again on amazon when I get into a Prison Break mood! Awesome series!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You got to buy this app!;Its easy/hard and fun.Whenever I get stuck on an level I can just skip it! I recomand you by it. great game that's what it is.
B00BESM14U|4.0|The title does not do the movie justice.  It is a great coming of age story with a Breakfast Club feel to it. There is a rebel and a geek and a jock and a wallflower.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it but I think it should have more animals like dogs and when I get to go to a compitetoun the background is the same its boring but the rest I love!!!
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|The animation is fantastic but the story line is maybe to scary for those under seven.  There are zombies in it after all!
B0012NVGHU|2.0|This wasn't a movie I would watch again.  I love the song they sing, but the rest of the movie is a chore to watch.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this app. Being able to play it on my Kindle Fire and synching it with your facebook account makes it one of the best.
B007EECSFA|3.0|The last 20% of the book was great (Kindle).  However, it was very wordy, with vocab that the normal person does not use - at least I got a lot of use out of the Kindle dictionary.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I downloaded this app on my Kindle Fire. It has up to the minute temperatures and forecasts for your hometown.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book is much better than the movie. Nicholas Sparks is a great author, I have read many of his books.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is very easy to use. It has a great design with big easy to read numbers. Would recommend this to everyone.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am DYING now waiting for more Gideon and Eva<br />HURRY Sylvia Day!!!<br />Great read and truly great Book!<br /><br />:)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A very powerful and well written story.  It's a book that is hard to read because you want to change the inevitable but impossible to put down.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great look into the career of a great American Hero, who survived the horrors of war only to be shot by a rotten coward he was trying to help God Bless Chris Kyles family!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downtin Abbey is one of the best series I have ever watched!  Love each of teh characters and can't wait until the next one is ready!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a must own for any Batman Fan. I could watch The Dark Knight Trilogy for days. I do feel like the special features are a little lacking but the history of the Batmobile was a must watch for me. The case it comes in is also great as well.
B0045XGRQE|4.0|Lots of neat graphics and non-stop action.  Many good stars in this, and the partnership between Cheedle and Downey is a good addition to the series.  Most sequels are trying too much to be like the first success, while this one continues the plot, it moves in a new direction, and I think it stands on its own.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|What a breath of fresh air!  No gratuitous sex and violence.  I love the story line and the characters.<br />Can't wait for season 4!!!!!
B007UUQJLM|5.0|Beyond the epic &#34;Sinnerman,&#34; which by itself makes this an album worth getting, this is one of Simone's most solid studio collections. I'm not a collector, so getting a used original release for an ungodly price wasn't an option. The remastered vinyl sounds great.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|One of the best book series I have ever read. It's so in depth and makes you appreciate each character on different levels. Everyone should read this beautiful series.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|This movie didn't make much sense. Slow moving. Still don't know why the guy killed all those girls. Two hours of my life I won't get back. Don't waste your time!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Interesting weave of events with a great ending.  This book is a clever story line which keeps you guessing all the way to the end of the book.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|I thought the picture was carried by Helen Merrin, and that the whole picture or story was rather flat. It was not the worst thing ever though.
B00B19F3PG|5.0|this movie was interesting throughout and kept me captivated the entire time. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror and thrillers
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love Bruno's unorthodox jukebox!!!! I just wish I could have paid this price!  Plus some of the customers mentioned the extended version with 2 extra tracks! So my advice is to order that version and get more bang for your buck.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I'm a huge Foo Fighters fan, saw them last year at JazzFest in New Orleans. Love Love the new album!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This is a great game - got up to Hammerhead and almost to the next level. Then the game froze for the second time and I lost everything.  So I uninstalled - will reinstall if it is ever updated. Sorry to loose a great game but with the freeze problem not worth the frustration on my Kindle Fire.
B0019I6WDG|5.0|Great Movie. I loved it. not quite the ending I expected, but it was still good. I live these actors
B0010OIN90|5.0|My son loves it and wears it all the time! It has helped him learn to tell time better. He also changes it around all the time. It's great.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Love Sandra Bullock. great movie, would recommend it to everyone to own or watch, based on a true story also
B004WMKXWM|5.0|I plan to purchase the entire series on bluRay. . My wife even loved it and she's not one to watch many movies
B001RIY4WE|4.0|This version inclued some extra scenes in the movie, those scenes arent relevant for the movie but they looks nice on.
B002RRWWQ4|5.0|Loved it. It was much more than my wife and I thought it would be.. Will probably purchase the entire series on blu ray
B006Z21ZJC|4.0|Well, it´s Iron Maiden, may be isn't one of the best conserts but is verry good, the DTS sonud is amasing
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|She has a lovely voice and is a great songwriter- I'm glad she's back. She's soul, she's guts, she's complicated.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Excluding Alien Resurection (I dont like it) the box-set it's very nice. Theres a lot of extras and new material.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So much better. It is like my eyes are glued to the screen. The new gems are boss and I love the power ups
B000NTPDSW|3.0|I was expecting a little bit more, but it's ok, the box it's simpe.<br />I didnt se the extras yet, as soon as I see it I will add a little bit more
B004XWLN20|5.0|This series is amazing I would recommend it to everyone. Even if your a superman fan smallville delivers for sure .
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It makes a great gift for the avid reader in your life! Chris Kyle is missed in the great state of TEXAS!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Was hooked on season 1 so naturally wanted to continue with this interesting family. The set design and costumes are amazing.  It's fun to take a peek into the past.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|Really deep movie with a very twisted plot. Would like to see a continuation of the story. MAtt Damon is really creepy in this one.

Disc one contains the concert which has been specially upgraded and extended from the existing 1989 longform VHS release and now includes three previously unreleased encores: Running Free, Run To The Hills and Sanctuary thereby completing the full concert with a total running time of 110 minutes .<br /><br />Maiden's own Film Producer and Director Andy Matthews went back to the 1988 edit and painstakingly remastered each shot digitally; colour correcting and grading to give the image the best possible look from that time. As well as the VHS stereo sound track by Martin Birch, the band's producer between 1981 and 1993, the DVD also includes a brand new 5.1 audio surround mix by Maiden's current producer Kevin Shirley.<br /><br />The concert was meticulously directed and edited by bass player and founder member Steve Harris, so as to capture the performance from a fans-eye view of the stage, focusing fully on the music, the elaborate stage production and the lighting. Add into the mix an electrifying set list and of course Eddie, and Maiden England now offers a snapshot of a bygone era in which the band, as they continue to do today, devote their all in delivering the ultimate live experience for their fans.<br /><br />Disc two is an extensive bonus disc featuring an exclusive documentary charting Part 3 in the History of Iron Maiden. This 40-minute film comprises recent interviews with the five band members and manager, Rod Smallwood. Picking up the story in the aftermath of the '84/85 World Slavery tour, this interesting and insightful documentary sees the band speak candidly about their memories of an exciting and occasionally turbulent period from which would emerge the albums Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. As the Eighties began to draw to a close, so did another chapter in Maiden's compelling history.<br /><br />Other special extras on the bonus disc include Twelve Wasted Years. First released as a longform VHS in 1987 and available for the first time on DVD, this documentary runs for 90 minutes and includes archive interviews and dynamic live footage from the band's beginnings in the now legendary Ruskin Arms pub, via London's Marquee club and three World Tours. Five promo videos for the singles from the aforementioned albums are also featured and have been carefully restored and improved upon from the original films using the very latest software with the audio remastered in digital stereo.<br /><br /> .
B008IYSMLY|1.0|What I've been able to see is good.  However, the streaming service crashes often no matter what type of device I try to watch it on.  Recovery often requires software reboot, and playing guessing games as to where I left off, since the resume feature rarely works.<br /><br />I highly recommend just ordering the DVD's and waiting a few days for them to show up in the mail.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|SPOILER THREAT: MINIMAL.  I've tried to stay general as much as possible.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath makes you feel vulnerable and exposed to a monster greater than all of us.  It doesn't take much, a couple seasons of drought (in this case), you miss those payments, and pretty soon the bank has your house.  What can you do?  You struggle to find a place to live or find a place to die.  The dustbowl isn't what makes us vulnerable, it's the system itself; tragedy like this can strike for many reasons, and therefore is, in essence, inevitable.<br /><br />Steinbeck was an incredible talent.  A lot of reviewers have said the book is slow, but I disagree.  The plot moves forward immediately, but I think reviewers are responding to a plot that sneaks up on the reader and Steinbeck's emphasis on voice.  He alternates his voice seemingly effortlessly between the Oklahoman drawl in chapters devoted specifically to the protagonist Joad family and the other chapters that magnify the tragedy to multitudes of families suffering a similar fate.<br /><br />Not only is Steinbeck brilliant with his use of voice, but his understanding of cool transcends time.  Tommy Joad is straight up cool, and he's as cool today as he ever was.  The world loves a man that does what needs to be done: supporting his family, being a strong leader and brother, but also when circumstances force him to action, Tom won't back down, up to and including killing a man (or two), going to prison, and possibly leading a communist revolution.  I'm not advocating these actions, but you can't argue what a great character Tommy makes.<br /><br />There is also a great deal of gender role development throughout.  When things are good, the family is structured one way, but as things go bad, the family structure must react, or adapt.  Characters are pushed to their limits and strength is shown as both a masculine trait, but also as a subtle and often deeper feminine trait.  Some writers seem capable of writing dialogue for only one sex, but Steinbeck proves himself to be a master of both.<br /><br />Another common complaint is that the ending disappoints.  I assume those that didn't complain, probably went out and hung themselves.  Yes, it's a depressing book!  That's the point.  When things get bad, you have to do unbearable things to survive.  The worse things get, the farther the Joad family is willing to go to help their family and others.  The events push the limit of human endurance.  You think this book would be worth reading if the Joad family found steady work and lived happily ever after?  But the ending is also beautiful in a way, exemplifying love and unity of man.  It's unpredictable through omission and inclusion.  It's worth it, so finish the book.<br /><br />The Grapes of Wrath is powerful, memorable, and remains relevant to modern society; it is truly a classic work of literature.ogue for only one sex, but Steinbeck proves himself to be a master of both.<br /><br />Another common complaint is that the ending disappoints.

B005GFPZYK|3.0|Despite the intense subject material, Kyle somehow manages to make the narrative not very exciting. The writing is understandably plain and linear.  More than anything the book kind of forces the authors views down your throat and at times was dripping with false modesty. Although I disagree with almost all Kyle's personal beliefs, I must admit that he has seen some s*** and has earned everyone's respect. It's just clear that hes not a natural writer.
B0058BI896|5.0|Also becoming a classic TV series. The humor is best in series one and two. Later years they seemed to get more formal, looked too<br />&#34;polished&#34; (face lifts?). Still, pretty funny!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I don't know I feel about it. But it has a lot going on and I like it. I will keep it!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Draw Something is a game where you can play against friends. You pick something to draw then draw it. The other person has to guess what you drew. Some people just write out the word to get points.<br /><br />I only rated it three stars because you have to wait until that person guesses what you drew until you can play with them. However you can play with more than one person.<br /><br />I usually just played this game when I was bored. It is a pretty good game. It does have multiple adds that pop up when playing.<br /><br />It is overall a decent game. If you like to draw and/or challenging games then this would be for you .  Thanks!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I wouldn't even watch this by myself. The house tells a different story every week, I loved the series on T.V.
B00009R6H2|5.0|Not much to say about the quick release plate.  I have two plates that I have used since 2000 and they are still working like a charm.  Easy on, Easy off.  Not much else to write; but if your head supports the 410PL, my all means waste no time and get some.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Just what my niece wanted. goes with her collection. The service was just as expected, great as always. Good job.
B003UYUP58|5.0|As a new oncology/chemo nurse I found this book to be incredibly easy to read & understand. I love the history & insight provided in such a way that, at times, it actually sucked me in as a page-turning novel would.
B007SUW24W|5.0|This CD is beautiful and everyone needs to purchase it, despite your interest in Ed Sheeran. Every single song is incredibly beautiful, and I have all of them on my iTunes account. All of these songs are also good songs to fall asleep to, since they have a relaxing mood. Overall, it's an incredibly good CD, and everyone needs to buy it.<br /><br />BUY IT NOW.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Fast paced, witty, fun, intelligent, nerd friendly, accurate science, who could want more?  I can't wait for the 7th season.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|The initial premise and the first 25% or so were quite good. After this point though, the book begins moving in circles. Reading about Harold camping and meeting 'new' people that all have suspiciously similar problems to Harold is only interesting for so long.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I love this series. I only recently discovered it. I am wondering what rock I have been living under. Sheldon makes me feel less neurotic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was absolutely intense and was  very well plotted<br />And was well worth reading couldn't put  it down once I picked it up
B0034G4P4O|5.0|The item Arrived on time and the quality was outstanding. It was very professionally wrapped and set up for mailing.
B00AP9RQE4|3.0|but the ending of Cryoburn was definitely a body blow so I didn't mind reading this one.  I did re-read Cordelia's Honor though (for the fifth time) to remind myself of the wonderful characters who drew me in way back when.
B004AKCME8|4.0|The item Arrived on time and the quality was outstanding. It was very professionally wrapped and set up for mailing.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I can't imagine why the female agent didn't take the second shot after hitting Bond on the train.  A disappointing movie and started fast forwarding about 1/3 of the way through.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is AWESOME! It may look completely different but it's Cool. There are only 4 different characters but that's okay. It's also a little easier because you can see farther in the game.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Having seen the movie, I'm not surprised it garnered a group of Oscars.  Definitely a suspenseful movie; Ben Affleck is great as both the star and the director.  We got expanded info on background and history of the real events in our download and that was fascinating.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I bought this item so I could keep up with the series.  It comes on too late at night for me to stay up and watch.  But I admit I still haven's been able to view my copy as I am still so busy.  I am sure it will keep me entertained once I find time to sit and watch it.  Thank you very much, Denise
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|I am not a surfer, but I have lived near the ocean, including Santa Cruz where this movie takes place, so it was interesting to me at least to see the locations featured in the movie, including Mavericks.  While surfing is the over-riding theme here,  this movie will appeal to more than just surfers.  Cinematically this was a well made movie that really delivered in sight and sound quality.  The storyline did feel a little &#34;Disneyish&#34; at times, but not in a bad way.  It was a touching and inspiring movie that I highly recommend.  Gerard Butler does a fine job in the role as the sage surfer mentor.  And no, I am not going to try and ride a Mavericks wave now !  but I will for sure watch this fine movie more than once.  Do yourself a favor and watch this on as big a screen as you can to get the full effect of these monster waves !
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I saw the  movie in the theater and wanted it for my personal collection.  Kristen Stewart was a Joan of Arc affect.  I really enjoyed this movie.  Thank you so very much.  Demose
B009HNDCC4|5.0|The only comedies that even comes close to a rival for this are &#34;Louie&#34; and &#34;Curb Your Enthusiasm&#34; which have the advantage of being cable shows. This is the wittiest writing and a show that never fails to make me feel good by the end of every episode, as did this one.
B00932A3SK|4.0|This movie has plenty of twists and turns.  The story-line is suspenseful and keeps you engaged.  Very good directing.  Good character development and acting.  Solid movie.  I enjoyed it.
B008FPZQQU|5.0|manditory purchase with Steven Wilson 5.1 mix. Damn!<br />The surround mix is amazing. I've just heard Steven will not finished the cycle, very disappointing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|totally addicting!!!now i need to read the third book...it's worth the eyebags and all...suzanne collins did an awesome job!superb!!!love it...
B008FPZQRO|5.0|A new appreciation for ELP now. The surround mix is amazing. I've just heard Steven will not finished the cycle, very disappointing.
B00009RGBS|5.0|After seeing &#34;Geisha&#34; which Rob Marshall directed and which I enjoyed tremendously, I decided to view &#34;Chicago' for which he is better known.  I saw Chicago when it first came out but had forgotten how incredible Chicago's dancing routines are.  The fact that only one of the three stars ever trained as a dancer and the other two had learned their routines under Rob's tuition and performed them so amazingly well makes the film even more worth seeing.  It's fun and glamourous and a feel good movie.
B004SEUIWO|5.0|I love the actors and the music.  It is so worth the money and I would recommend it to a friend :)
1465001107|5.0|Love the calendar! Gotta have it! Maybe not as good as last year but it's very nice and I see Michael everyday.
1935597760|5.0|the end, which was a little too unrealistic and fairy tale ish for my taste. However, I still give it 5 stars because it was just that good (sans the ending). I would definitely read more books from this author.
B000A1SZ2Y|3.0|very good product, I wish it was easier to focus at close range, is a bit hard to focus range depending on the distance, is a bit better than the Opteka, but the improvement is not overwhelming
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is worth the money it is one of the best games I ever played. I love playing it with my nieghbor I have so much fun. minecraft is the best. get the app now. whet ya waiting for.
B005HEF8OC|4.0|I'm glad to see this on amazon. It was good to see the series without commercials and the picture quality was great.
B00B8ESX42|2.0|We rented this movie because of the Academy Award nominations for Joaquin. He did do great job in that aspect but otherwise the movie is very boring.
B000HF6XPY|2.0|This was cool when I was younger. I thought that there was more to the story, but disappointed. Good picture.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Pretty good ending, however, it could have been better.  I can't say how.  This book (series) reminded me of 1984 and how we cannot trust government.
B0087GZ8YW|2.0|This was the &#34;least&#34; of the Rebus novels. The solution seemed to be inserted late as if the entire schema had not been thought out.  The two gangster leads were too similar, whithout a real reason for their presence.  The entrapment of the young villain was not credible.  I had expected to see a further dimension, or deepening of the Rebus character. It was disppointing to see him seem less likable rather than a good man whose flaws might dominate to his adversaries, or adverserial colleagues, but be overshadowed by his skill and goodness to those who dare to come close.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|The voices from these Irish angels is just mesmerizing. The drummers are particularly good. We especially appreciate Ray Fean and his 'feeling' the music. This is a must buy for anyone who appreciates good music.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I was a teen of the 80's so being able sing along with EVERY song is fun (and this is a full blown musical). It's also a great way to spend a couple of hours with your Gen X/Y kid.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I surprised myself in choosing this novel, as I usually steer clear of courtroom drama. However, the \\"family\\" theme drew me in. And kept me wanting more. I was touched by the love & never ending faith Andrew had for his son, Jacob. A sharp contrast to the feelings of doubt from his mother, Laurie. One would expect to see these parental roles reversed. Mothers showing their unconditional love & fathers who disconnect, doubt & remove themselves.<br />We can all relate to the adolescence angst which Jacob experienced. I question the happiness of Andrew & Laurie' s marriage. Was it a desperate \\"wanting\\" on Andrew's part? If the marriage was as solid as described early on, I believe the ending would have been far different.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys courtroom drama, putting themselves in the role of attorney. However, if you are the parent of an adolescent, and a reader who throws themselves into a role, it will be an exhausting read for you. How can it not be, when your child is accused of first degree murder?
B003M70O5O|5.0|This show is awesome, you can't watch just one episode at a time. It's more addictive than caffeine. Love it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The intro caught my interest immediately.  Not my usual type of book but what a lovely story thoroughly enjoyed it, couldnt put it down.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|IMHO they never get old.  I'm laughing at all those Disco sucks freaks who burned all their collectors items.  I wish they were still going, but death robed Barry to.  One of the best bands around to this day.  And everyone knows it.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Poor editing made reading this book a little frustrating, I'd sack the proof reader!!  Writer repeats things too much and always seems to describe the characters as 'screaming' when in fact they would surely be 'yelling'.  Big Difference.<br /><br />Enjoyed the story though, also read 2 & 3, looking forward to the next one just to see what happens.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|A new one for me, but not too much of a stretch.  This cd is a feel good kind.  You did good boys.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|OMG this game is a great time killer!!!! It has amazing graphics especially for a kindle fire game. Although it doesn't always load for me:( but otherwise its a great game!!!
B002SEW5WW|4.0|I've heard only a few songs off this one.  I don't know what to make of it just yet.  I've heard To Late and All My Secrets thus far. Not bad.  Still listening though.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I though this movie was a refreshing departure from the common drama.  While the story is somewhat familiar, the intrigue of the story surrounding an airline pilot... compelling.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love that the story did not end in the first book. The excerpts that we're from Christians point of view were really great.<br />All I can say is it all leaves u wanting MORE...
B008OOYALE|5.0|Keep the kids entertained for hours!!!! Great for the car!!!! I would recommend this game to others!!!  A real must have!!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Easy to learn and fun to play. My son kicked my top score the first time he tried it!<br /><br />Reminds me of Mario kart
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love Angry birds & this version is just as good. This is a very addicting game.<br /><br />Swen Fam !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did not see the movie before reading this, so I was surprised by how quickly I got into the story. Can't wait to see what happens in the next book!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This is one movie I don't mind watching over and over again with the kids. Very cute and funny movie. Good buy.
B008WCP2KG|4.0|...as a Valentine's Day present, and she loved it. She's a pretty big Channing Tatum fan, so this made some sense for her. I personally wouldn't watch this movie, but that's why it was for her.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Its seems churlish to proffer a critique of Jane Austen when she is so widely regarded as the literary doyenne of her era.  However the book is so different (and superior) to the dramatisations of it that the read is like discovering yet another book. I admire her command of the English language and her ability to convey so many nuances in such beautifully written prose.  Unique and brilliant
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo was excellent and deserved all the awards it earned. All the actors did an excellent job on a very delicate subject
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I just needed to figure out something quick, and I decided to see if there were any calculator apps for Kindles.  On my Kindle Fire, it shows up nice and big, nice and clear, and it works perfectly.  I have absolutely no complaints.
0553386697|4.0|I purchased the book to compare with a similar, but shorter book, published in Sweden where my nephew, (Torgny Steen)  outlines a program of slow motions developed to facilitate and enhance activating  both sides of the brain. His book was published to spread the word about the therapeutic value of slow motion in helping school children focus and be calm.<br />I was asked to translate Torgny's book into English and purchased The Whole-Brain Child to familiarize myself with the  vocabulary used by professionals.<br /><br />The book was concise and very clearly illustrated the various movements and I was satisfied with my purchase.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Outstanding recount of what actually happened during the Iranian hostage crisis.  Accurate portrayal of life in Iran and the Middle East.  Highly recommended!!!  (smile)
0062127241|5.0|This book was purchased as a Christmas gift of my elder son who grew up listening to Pete Townsend live, in concerts.  He loved the well written autobiography of a Star he still listens to when the opportunity arises.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Beyond the excellent acting, the writing for the major characters is unusual, their character development far more sophisticated and complex than the usual offbeat guy + smart gal work together and then must have sexual tension, etc.  Each episode is better than the last for character development, although they do tend to gory (not my taste).  But worth it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|It seems that the popular opinion favors widescreen over fullscreen disc formats, but I've always loved fullscreen. I pre-ordered this dvd and it's slightly annoying to me that the only version of it was in widescreen. Oh well, I'll get over it. Other than that, I absolutely love Daniel Craig in Skyfall--of his three 007 movies (Casino, Quantum, Skyfall) I love Skyfall the most because you get to see a more vulnerable/emotional James Bond, which appeals to me as a female. But some people think he looks old/haggard, which I'd label as &#34;mature looking&#34;. I personally love men with more &#34;mature&#34; looks because to me it gives them more character.
B008I34YYY|3.0|I would give this a solid 3 stars out of 5... I liked the concept of the movie...perhaps in the right hands, it would have become a classic worth watching over and over...but once or twice is enough.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It was an entertaining movie (because it's action and I have a bias for action movies), but it wasn't the most exciting action movie I'd ever seen. I've seen many movies featuring Jeremy Renner, and though I'm personally not a big fan of him, I will say that I enjoyed his acting in The Bourne Legacy more than anything else I've seen in him. (Maybe it has to do with the fact that he seems more like a &#34;lead&#34; actor rather than a supporting one, because he actually is the lead actor in the film...). I'll have to say, the plot was really simple compared to the other Bourne movies (starring Matt Damon), but despite its simplicity, the story was still fairly well carried out. At the very least, it did keep me entertained for the whole duration of the movie (i.e. I didn't stop the movie halfway because it was boring). In conclusion, would I buy this movie? No (I only give movies I buy/absolutely love 5 stars). Would I watch it again with some friends should they want to see it? Perhaps (hence, the 3.75 out of 5 stars).
B004YCKK6Y|4.0|Weirdly made movie...something to watch more than once to grab some sense of the film...the premise seems fairly straightforward, but more to the movie than meets the eye...there is what I think is a pretty funny scene with Antonio Banderas...not for the kiddies, rated R.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a fun game. i'm really enjoying it. it has multiple layers and those are the best games. it is challenging too.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I would recommend this show to anyone. Excellent..saw it directly on HBO but just had to own it!<br />Service from vendor..very good and quick!
B001QWBM62|5.0|Love the way this works. I'm recording live to high quality audio with one device. Nice. I hope you start making external speakers to plug in. I would buy those too. - T
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I began watching DR. Who OFF and on in the 70's.  I hate to admit that  I love the concept, and although the scientist in me keeps saying \\"that doesn't make any sense\\". I get tied up with the characters and can't wait for the next fix. It's a great way to turn off the world for and hour or so.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Great family movie! Fun Funny and kept my attention throughout the entire show. I would recommend this movie for all ages.
B007THA4FI|4.0|It was a very interesting fast moving story.  It gave you a lot to think about when examining the characters.  It was a very different kind of story which made it a more enjoyable read although the story is intense.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids love this game and I was impressed with the creative builds my kids were able to come up with! Good clean fun for girls and boys.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Fringe Season 1 is a great show and would recommend it to anybody who enjoys watching sci-fi.  Although season one has a slow pick up, the following seasons just take off and are well worth the wait felt in season one.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie has become a standard for my family to watch anytime between after Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas morning, usually several times. If you don't like it, I hope you are enjoying life clinging to communism.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!!! Best Blu Ray DVD I have bought in a while! Satisfied fully with this purchase! Thanks a lot y'all!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Some of the best movies ever made. A great collection and great value I would recommend it to anyone that loves movies
B0042ETJU2|5.0|AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!!! Best Blu Ray DVD I have bought in a while! Satisfied fully with this purchase! Thanks a lot y'all!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Though the story is pure soap opera it is a beautiful production and wonderful to view!  Shows the entrenched class system.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!!! Best Blu Ray DVD I have bought in a while! Satisfied fully with this purchase! Thanks a lot y'all!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|lots of room and way less expensive than one i bought for 70 something a while back ..this one is constructed good also..
B000TGCR4C|5.0|Thrill bound and Paul Verhoeven is to be complimented.  A mix of 3 languages is well done and the actors are superb.
0061692034|2.0|Wasn't what I expected.  I saw book club reviews for Canada.  It was written by a female writer.  Are there two books with the same name.  I found the book drawn out and boring a lot of the time.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|watched it at least 3 times yesterday.......who doesn't love a trilogy......different from the first two but still keeping it real.......
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|It was more then what I expected. From what I was told it was a bad movie and let down. But tonight I finally watched it. I do not know why people thought it was bad, I think it was a very good movie.<br /><br />The ending shocked me though. I was NOT expecting that. And seeing the woman in black everywhere freaked me out too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie, because I did the worse thing imaginable I watched the movie in the dark and alone and now I am creeped out lol. But anyways good movie and the acting and actors were great also.<br /><br />A is the grade I give on this movie.
B00005N5S5|5.0|the movie that started it all.......cant help but give rave reviews about this movie.....its the beginning of many to come and no one should be disappointed in the origional

B005G4TJUC|5.0|loved the movie more than the television series from the 80's.......my boys loved it so much they were characters from the movie for Halloween....my 3 year old loves cars more than ever after seeing this
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Got this app for my little cousin. It keeps him busy and he loves angry birds all versions of the game.

B002ZG98UA|5.0|again different from the others but still very good movie.....certain parts remind me of other movies....the big guy with the anvil....silent hill.....and the action is some parts remind me of the matrix
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this app play this on Facebook all the time. Now that I have a tablet I don't have to sit at the computer all the time.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I watched this movie before the academey awards show,and was not the least bit surprised that it won awards for Ang Lee and for cinimatogrophy.  It is a beautiful story with a beautiful setting. Ang Lee is one of my favorite directors, so I'm glad he won that too.
B007N85POS|5.0|Got this app for my little cousin. It keeps him busy and he loves angry birds all versions of the game.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Sada sings very beautifl on this DVD.  The music is excellent.  I love it.  It is well worth the money.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Love being able to print my school work from my tablet or any other documents I need. Great at if you have a wireless printer.
B0086700CM|3.0|This is a fun game but not one of my favorite.  I'm more of a traditional Mahjong player so this game isn't what I was looking for.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|This has been one of the best series I have read. Blew through them read them all in three days wow loved the action and the characters. You won't be disappointed with this one!
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I think I'm too old for this game.  I could see kids enjoying playing & having fun trying to get the prize but it wasn't for me.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Fascinating book. Well written. Pete's a very interesting character, and the events in his life are worth reading about, and very interesting to me, an old Who fan.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Used this app last night when I went to sleep.  Just picked out what I wanted to listen to, set the timer on the app & I was off to sleep.  Very relaxing.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|We really enjoy Glee. The story line is very well written, and the cast is first class!!  We laugh and sing along with each episode!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is one of those games that once you start it's hard to put it down.  Trying to get higher points is addictive.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|It was quick to read. i enjoyed it.<br />i would recommend it. Good for a day at the beach read.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This was not one of the best games I've played.  Maybe someone else will like this but it's not for me.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This was a heartwarming and very well written series. Several characters took on a life of their own, like Queenie. I especially enjoyed the feeling of the time and place that the stories took place.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Ok, I took organ lessons about 45 years ago so this is fun for me to be able to play an instrument again.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Not really what I needed to be reading. I guess it gave some good ideas and reminders that sex is important part of a relationship, but not all of it.
B002SR2PKG|3.0|Could have been  shorter it was ok not really that scary I've always wanted to read this book since I watched the miniseries  as a kid  it's an alright read some of it doesn't make any sense though, the turtle puking up the universe for example amongst other things 11 year olds having sex as other reviewers have stated as a gang bang I didn't see it as that but still distastefull.I expected better from all the rave reviews I'm a Stephen King fan but this book just didn't do it for me.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I can guess the ending half way through even though I know some drama will take place prior to that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best even though after I bought an expensive guy from Ny and my game restarted I still love it. THIS GAME IS MY LIFE!!! I recommend that you get it you dont need to pay real money.
B00006J3WH|5.0|loved this episode and all the songs im very pleased to have this thank you !!!!! been looking foward to it
B0086700CM|4.0|at first the game is hard but then after you get the hang of it it gets easier but eventually it gets Boring if you like this game I recomened you get the 2nd one
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|My boys like playing it. They like to feel like they are taking care of something.<br />I let them rate it
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|its okay but it gets boring after a while. plus it doesn't have a lot of words and it is hard to draw a picture for it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good game the game gets you thinking. And it is a unique game to play. The game is a contrasting game in my opinion.
0345803485|1.0|I had high expectations for this book, having read that is was a bestseller. I do not read novels of this genre, but decided to give it a shot due to all the hype. It was terribly disappointing. The writing is repetitive, boring, and sometimes even childish.  The &#34;Jeez&#34;, &#34;oh my&#34;, gasping and flushing.... Could the writer find no other words? Do not buy this book. It is really not worth reading.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Well your playing the game a lot of ads pop up. If there where no ads I would give it 5 stars. The rest of the game is great!
B00785P2QC|5.0|If you like any G5 games (or even if you don't) I highly recommend this super addicting and strategic game!
B0016OOS16|5.0|Great for using on any Graphics program, I am a CATIA V5 programmer and this device just works fantastic, makes my programming in 3D much easier. It feels very comfortable in my left hand while I use the mouse in my right, I can get a lot more work accomplished with this device. Nice and heavy so it doesn't move around on the desk when applying pressure to manipulate your work on screen. Also you can adjust the sensitivity for your own feel. Price is very reasonable for what you can save in time working a project as you will save time in the long run. Also it looks great.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The book was fast paced and really kept you on the set of your pants.  Once I started I could not put it  down.  The more you learn about Lizabeth and her abilities and the tough life she had the more you found yourself wanting to learn more.  The final two books in the trilogy really do a great job filling in all the blanks.
1616550414|5.0|If you're even a moderate fan of the Zelda franchise, you owe it to yourself to check this book out.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I use this app on a regular basis and it is always accurate with picking up the songs I want to hear
B005LAII08|5.0|The five disk collectionwas nice because none of my devices were excluded from the minivan DVD the PlayStation Blu raythe phones in the iPad too.
B0094K1K42|3.0|It is nothing special really. I probably wouldn't watch it a second time, but it wasn't necessarily a bad movie.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Can't wait for the third book in the series. I found this one as interesting and fun as the first book.
B002U1F32M|4.0|This movie made me cry but it was good. I'm not big on rom coms but I really liked this one.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it for what it offers.Great to carry around on the Kindle Fire HD. Which is a wonderful buy. Better product than the Nook. I have the reader and Kindle Fire HD.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game lots of fun and free there is so much to do on it like feeding the animals... building houses and more

B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is great you should read it. When I read it it was just amazing! I think you should read it too.
B009K0P10K|5.0|THIS SHOW TELLS THE STORY SLOWLY.  IT HAS ALOT OF CHARACTER INSIGHTS.  THE CHARACTERS INNER ACT A LOT.  THERE ARE TWISTS AND TURNS YOU DON'T SEE COMING.  I HAVE WATCHED IT FROM DAY ONE AND I LOVE IT.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This was a very good documentary. I learned things I never knew about Bob Dylan. Lots of great song and mostly narrated by Dylan himself. Loved it !!
B00B2G4O2G|4.0|THIS SHOW IS FAST, SUSPENCEFUL AND AND FULL OF TWISTS AND TURNS.  IF YOU BLINK, YOU MISS SOMETHING.  GREAT ACTING TOO.
B005QKYIZ2|5.0|It's wonderful and powerful! Very moving, & makes you want to move yourself. A rare gem in the climate of popular music today.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 so far is GREAT (so far as of 2/27).  Tension is building!  Andrea is a bitch, but I think she will come around...
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|She just knows how to get to me. I sometimes wonder if just maybe she found my diary from my teen age/early 20s days. Raw, and quirky, makes you think.

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The franchise has truly returned to its roots and redeveloped a sense of humor.  Daniel Craig is a true heir to Sean Connery.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|For everyone that is getting the package install error, uninstall the app and then reinstall it. The error occurs if you purchased the app through amazon but updated it through the Google play store. When that happens the digital signature is altered and the Amazon store does not recognize the app as being purchased through Amazon, so it will not update.
B000JZ68GG|2.0|You remember &#34;Barbarella&#34; as a sexy little camp classic, don't you. A bygone relic, a knowingly funny gem featuring an adorable, scantily-clad Jane Fonda and ridiculous special effects.<br /><br />You're probably better off not watching it again.<br /><br />It starts well. Turns out you were right about Fonda. She's beautiful, sexy, and has a too-good-for-this-mess intelligence about her that, at times, carries the movie. And it feels like a naughty pleasure to watch this version, which features enough nudity (including Ms. Fonda's) to warrant a soft R rating. But after the first 20 minutes, you're treated to slow-moving scenes featuring mostly wooden, joyless actors. You get a villain who's both unpleasant and rather dull - even in his hysterical, over-the-top final scene. You notice an odd sense of ennui, as if the actors were stuck doing overtime again. And you get an ending that doesn't really resolve anything. When it's over, it's just sort of...over.<br /><br />There are nice touches, some hilariously bad songs (featuring some of the most out-of-tune singers ever recorded), and a few bits of psychedelia that will please the trippers among you. And there's Fonda, gamely making the best of it while showing off her lovely body. But if you want a TRUE guilty, dated campy pleasure, you're much better off tracking down Beyond the Valley of the Dolls or Flash Gordon (or, hell, the possibly superior Flesh Gordon). &#34;Barbarella&#34; may be camp, but I'm afraid it's no classic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing game for horse lovers. Fun and good quality. Never any glitches and its a good game to relax with.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|I haven't read many books that make me laugh out loud, but this one did. I frequently had to stop and giggle over the way that the author managed to captured something completely ridiculous and believable at the same time. The stories are relatable, but still remarkably funny and memorable.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|It was great to see it again without commercials.  Although it was in standard definition, the video quality and audio quality was very good.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Whenever John Lasseter works on a movie, I know it's going to be good. He helps make sure every movie Pixar makes is a masterpiece, and his stamp is on this movie also. In his movies, the story always comes first, and Wreck It Ralph has a good story, along with likable characters and plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun for me and the kids to play togather and on our own. Really feels like your takeing care of a horse
0316077046|2.0|I bought this book because I liked the first book, but was rather disappointed by it.  The first book had more charm to it and the characters were interesting.  In this book, Lena becomes unlikeable and flat...I can't see why Ethan would even risk his life going after her anymore.  There just isn't anything in the book that made me feel that he still cared for her--though I'm TOLD that he does--and nothing in the book that made me feel she still cared for him.  Telling is not the same as showing, which is one of the faults of this book.<br /><br />Lena is a Caster who ended up not making a choice over whether to go Light or Dark on her 16th birthday.  This is a break from the Order of Things.  In this book, she is mourning the death of her uncle and runs off with her cousin, a Dark Caster, and another new character...spurning Ethan, her Mortal boyfriend, in the process.  Ethan and Link (Ethan's best friend) and Liv (a Keeper in Training) end up going after her as she goes on a quest for the place where Light and Dark began, where Caster magic began.<br /><br />Besides the main characters not being as interesting in this, I think the main issue was the plot.  It involved a lot of wandering around and, just when things looked darkest, other characters would suddenly appear to save the day and, surprise surprise, it turned out they had known about the super secret Caster world all along.  The \\"secret romance\\" uncovered in this book could be seen a mile off.<br /><br />I can forgive a plot a lot when the characters are intriguing and I care about them...but I didn't care about any of them in this second book.  Its like the spark has gone out of it.  The only bits I liked a lot were as more aspects of the Caster world were revealed, small things mostly, but interesting all the same.  I think more of a focus on the differences of the two worldviews would be a good idea, thus highlighting the bridge created by the love between Lena and Ethan, a Caster and a Mortal.  But, if that's what the authors intended, it fell flat.  Just as most of this book fell flat.<br /><br />I already have the third book and so will read it.  If I hadn't already bought it, I might not have.  Here's hoping they get things right in that one.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|don't download game had lots of ponies on level 60 then logged on to play and everything was gone.  The game just started over. deleted!!
B0059XTTW8|4.0|The actual film is fantastic.  I'm a huge John le Carre fan, and while I love the book most, I definitely prefer this film to the BBC miniseries, which in my opinion explained a bit too much.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the extras are quite minimal.  I would have liked to see more behind the scenes discussion with the actors or production designers about why they made the decisions they did, perhaps something about the historical context of the book for us younger viewers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this app would recommend it to anyone. You don't have to spend real money on it Keith. love it
B005LAIGLE|5.0|This was one of my husband's Christmas gifts and he loved it. Mark Walberg really doesn't make a bad movie, in my opinion, except TED (the bear movie).  Not too bad on the eyes either !
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Please, if you might enjoy a smooth, almost liquid tenor voice, you should own this album.  I own all of Andrea's albums and this one measures up in spades.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|It's a rom-com and a chick flick, so you have to like those types of movies.  Betty White is pretty funny,
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Love a good James Bond movie :)<br /><br />The action, the music, and Dame Judy were all great in this movie.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This movie was well done in my opinion but the subject matter was upsetting.  The main character does redeem himself in the end of the movie.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was given to me as a birthday present and I really tried, but . . .<br />The rest of the one star reviews say it all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004I744AS|5.0|I loved the idea of having a dictionary on hand, I'm around a lot of people who don't know what they're saying but think they do on a regular basis. I'm glad it was free though, because I found out the next day that the kindle has two pre-installed dictionaries under &#34;books&#34;. I would recommend this to any &#34;smart device&#34; like a phone, etc. That doesn't already have a dictionary, but I'll always use Oxford' s dictionary as long as I have it!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This app is a lot of fun. I got it when it was the App of the Day (Free). I would pay for this app though. It's good. I play it on two devices.<br />Samsung Galaxy S3<br />Samsung Note Tab 10.1
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This obviously is not mario, but it's close enough! The only difference is a leprechaun and four leaf clovers and pine cones! Other than that, it's exactly mario, and the best mario game on the app market!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I loved this movie in theaters, and really enjoyed it at home.  I was able to sing a long and the extras were great!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story speaks to the heart of a subject  that most people only think about but never face.  Is a worthless life really worth  saving?  Who is to judge - he who feel worthless or others who can only imagine his worth. I found the characters in the book to be very believable and most, ,in his own way, quite admirable (although why  the father of our main character had to have a lover I couldn&#34;t understand).<br /><br />Suicide from the point of view of the commiter is not a topic often touched upon by fiction writers and this was done with sensitivity and penache.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter has all of these movies, and this is by far her favorite one.  It is a shame it is the last one in the series.
B000QUCNXG|3.0|wasn't sure where he was going in the end.  I wanted a bit more of a story about getting back to his homecountry.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I loved this movie in the theaters, and love it even more with the features on the DVD!  A definite must see and/or buy!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Of all the games I have downloaded for free, this one is the best. I have been addicted to it for the past week.
B0055S348W|3.0|The app works well on my kindel but the instructions/manual is somewhat lacking and could be expanded upon. However, it is great to have a way to print.
006117758X|5.0|Charles Bukowski isn't the type of author that snobby folks in literary circles are going to get all excited about. In fact, they'll probably turn up their noses and sneer when you even mention his name. This is because Bukowski wasn't some upper crust rich kid who got his whole literary career bankrolled by the fact that his dad or uncle controlled the biggest media conglomerate of the day. Nope, Bukowski lived on the street practicing his talent in anonymity for decades, and at the end of his life, the only thing he had to show for it was skill.<br /><br />To put it simply, you can actually read Bukowski. His style is light and effortless, but there is a profundity to his words that's very hard to capture. It'd be easy to think that Bukowski takes nothing seriously because his book is so entertaining, but I guarantee you'll recall flashes from his prose years later and only then realize how much wisdom the man managed to impart without you knowing it.<br /><br />I once asked a used bookseller which author's work was most frequently stolen from his shelves. &#34;Bukowski and Kerouac,&#34; was his instant reply. Any writer who provokes minor crimes just for the privilege of reading his work is not to be trifled with (when do you think such a thing happened with those stuffy old books the critics rave about but which end up gathering dust for centuries in the library of congress?).<br /><br />Oh...and it's funny, really funny. You'll burn through this manuscript in a couple of hours and find your cursor hovering over the &#34;buy&#34; button on &#34;Post Office,&#34; &#34;Factotum,&#34; &#34;Women&#34; and all the rest before you know it!
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|Just one of those books that I couldn't get into so I have never finished it.  Maybe one day I will try again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The initial reason for purchasing the series is because of all the positive chatter surrounding this product.<br />Since Season, we have been hooked. It meets everyone's criteria, funny, serious, family oriented (mostly), profoundly addictive.<br />I am waiting for Season 4, 5, 6,...........
1250004217|5.0|This book grabs you from the very beginning and you can't put it down.  I will look for other books from the writer.
B008TT7CXW|4.0|This is  a good way to keep all your SD Micro memory in one place, I found it a handy item to have and only experienced one problem with it. One of my Micro adaptor cards did not stay in the holder. It was a older one and well used which may or may not have anything to do with it.<br />I would recommend it and would purchase another should the need arise. Shipment was fast and packing was great.
B006BXTOFC|2.0|I have never been too impressed by the Black Keys, especially after seeing them live at Rock en Seine 2012. They're a solid band with good guitar riffs, but their performance was possibly the only one at that festival that really lacked any passion. I mean, I saw that they were really into what they were doing, but that passion wasn't communicated to the audience.<br />The other day, I thought that I was probably being too hard on them, so I decided to listen to several of their song samples after getting Lonely Boy stuck in my head.I thought, hey, these are some good guitar riffs, so why not?<br />After several good listens, I have to say this...<br />They're good and shiny in the beginning, but if you like to look for meaning in lyrics and instrumentals that show good progression, this is not the band for you. For a band who claims they aren't blues rock, they sure write way too much about love, broken hearts, and other love-related blues themes. Guitar riffs don't last long enough, and the musical progression within each song just isn't there. They seem so mathematically processed, like oh this is how long I should hold this note so that listeners will enjoy it, but I'm not really gonna let it all out. They're holding out. I mean, they're solid and they may be passionate about what they do, but that passion isn't communicated to their listeners.<br />Solid band, but they're definitely holding something from us.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|This movie is a very good action packed movie. Keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering happens next.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This show is one of my favorites. It is always worth watching for a good laugh. I would buy it again.
B00AJER3SE|4.0|The 1984 sci-fi/action classic \\"The Terminator\\" is one of the greatest and most influential films of all time. It's one of my top ten favorite films ever made and seems to only get better with age. So with that being said, the main purpose of my review is to talk about the new remastered blu-ray that was released on February 19th, 2013 and how it compares to the original blu-ray release from 2006.<br /><br />To be quick and to the point, this new blu-ray release blows the old disc out of the water. (This appears to be the same transfer that has been out for a little wile in Europe). Detail is greatly improved in addition to far superior contrast and black levels which is very important due to how much of the movie takes place at night. It was apparent with the 2006 blu-ray that the old ancient HD master used for the special edition DVD was dumped onto blu-ray which is what a ton of companies were doing at the beginning of the blu-ray era. There is a nice layer of film grain present that gives everything a nice feel with no evidence of digital noise reduction being applied. The old blu-ray barely looked better than an upconverted DVD and this new blu-ray FINALLY presents the film in the best quality that it's ever been for the home market. It's also on a dual layer disc this time with a very high bit rate in the mid to upper 30's throughout.<br /><br />There has been some grumbling on the internet of some fans questioning the transfer's more teal/bluish color scheme in comparison to past releases. Anybody who is fan of writer & director James Cameron knows that he really likes bathing his nighttime scenes in blue hues. I did a direct comparison with the old blu-ray and the new one appears much more natural in terms of skin tones and the overall color textures. The picture quality on then new blu-ray is just so beautiful and a massive improvement over the old disc, I really don't see how anybody who loves the film as much as I do would have any complaints.<br /><br />On the audio side, we get a lossless DTS surround mix that originally appeared on the old special edition DVD. This particular mix has been a point of contention with a lot of fans over the years. This is due to that the original audio for the film was in mono and for the surround remix, certain sound effects like gunshots were replaced. The old DVD featured both the original mono track and the 5.1 remix. The first blu-ray onl contained the surround remix. For this new blu-ray, I've always felt that the original audio track should be presented if a remix was done. With that being said, I don't mind the new gun shot sounds in the surround remix but would like to have had the mono track in lossless audio too.<br /><br />Extras are the same as the first blu-ray in which we get a 13 minute featurette on the visual effects & music, a fun 20 minute sit down conversation with James Cameron & Arnold Schwarzenegger reminiscing about the film and some deleted scenes. Still missing in action from the special edition DVD are the optional James Cameron commentary on the deleted scenes explaining why they were cut out as welll as the remained of the hour long making of doumentary that the visual effects piece was pulled from. Since this new blu-ray is on a dual layered 50 gigabyte disc, it's not an issue of space since those extras are all in standard definition to begin with. No trailers for the film are present either which is disappointing from a completist point of view.<br /><br />So, sadly we still have yet to get the true definitive blu-ray of The Terminator with those mentioned extras not being included along with the original mono audio track. But all fans owe it to themselves to get this new blu-ray due to the massive upgrade in picture quality. Do like I did hold onto your old special edition flipper DVD to have all of the extras and make your own 2 disc set. The movie looks gorgeous now compared to the old ancient blu-ray and this appears to be the best that we're going to get!ng to get!
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. Everything from the cast to the editing is flawless. It's full of meaning and sends a message. Absolutely brilliant piece of art.
1616550414|5.0|While the main target of this wonderful book are fans of the long-running series of Zelda games, it will also generally appeal to fans of Nintendo, Miyamoto, games, and concept art.<br /><br />This is a high-quality volume, wonderfully bound and full of crisp, colorful images covering the entire span of the Zelda games. While the focus of the book is clearly on later games such as Skyward Sword, Twilight Princess, Ocarina of Time, etc., the earliest titles are still discussed, giving this book a truly all-encompassing feel.<br /><br />If you have the money to spare and love Zelda, Nintendo and video game art, then look no further than this book for the ultimate addition to your personal library!
1439196834|5.0|I ordered this product as a gift and it worked out wonderfully! The recipient was thoroughly thrilled! Thanks so much!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I learned a lesson from her, not to give up hopes, she is right about keeping her girls private, kuddos.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|I would be lost without this app.  It makes the Kindle a more useful gadget.  Something the Kindle should have had by default.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app works great and I love the Color changing battery. I use it for my kindle fire. :) I will definitely. get it when I get a smartphone! :)
B0080BFVPU|5.0|Viewing Equipment: Epson 3010 3D PJ on a 92\\" DaLite Screen. Given the wide variety of reviews related to the PQ I was a little nervous about picking this one up. Grosse Point Blank is an all-time favorite film of mine and holds up extremely well on repeat viewings.<br /><br />I actually saw this in theatres when it first came out. Since I also view films on a very large format screen, nothing gets by me very easy. I had an opportunity to view this over the holidays on a family members 106\\" DaLite screen opposed to my usual 92\\". I must say the PQ was very good! I felt like I was watching a print; not video. I couldn't disagree more with any negative reviews of the PQ. I respect the opinions, but it certainly wasn't the experience I had thankfully. I sat about 15 feet back from the 106\\" screen. I noticed a few specks and scratches here and there, but nothing too egregious. I did notice some light ringing in scene or two. The only reason I caught that was because I was scrutinizing it very closely given some of the very harsh reviews I have read related to the PQ. The other thing that I find amusing is the fact that the DVD release of this film is non-anamorphic! You can't even seriously compare the DVD to the BD release of this film! LOL! The BD blows it away! I threw in the DVD first and watched it for awhile to see if I would notice a difference and when I put the BD in there was no comparison. I have seen some crappy BD's, but this isn't one of them. Batman Begins comes to mind. The PQ on that BD was very disappointing in many scenes. I think people tend to unfairly compare stuff shot recently on HD digital cameras and forget what film looks like.<br /><br />Fans of this film can purchase with confidence. The PQ is a solid 4 out of 5 stars.
B009IF82SK|3.0|This season's ok. It has some funny moments, but on a whole it's not as funny or well written as seasons 1-5. The dialogue isn't as smart.  Since some of the characters have paired off, the writers seem to have had problems finding something to drive the plot. Penny was a psycho, overly sensitive jerk for apparently no reason for the first few episodes (you may find this funny; I didn't). Lines seen more forced this season and more calculated for laughs. I found myself rolling my eyes and wincing instead of laughing. After the Valentine's Day episode with Penny and Leonard (I won't spoil anything for you), I think the Penny and Leonard thing has officially run its course and had now become annoying. You can only play on a fear of commitment for so long before it starts to become ridiculous. Sheldon is more neurotic and less logical. His assistant (whatever her name is) is funny but a little out of place in the plot. I think Howard and Bernadette now have the best dynamic as a couple and have had some of the best scenes this season (like when she hid his Xbox in the washer).  Raj could be used to further the plot, but he's been mostly showcased as a dating pariah- this may be changing based on the latest episode.  I like to see characters develop through shows.  While this season has had some good moments, I think overall the characters have been stagnant and devolving, especially when compared to previous seasons, so I've been disappointed with this season.
B0083IU84Y|5.0|I received the cd in the mail yesterday. I had heard two of the songs already, and was hoping this wasnt going to be one of those cds where you only like the song you have already heard. Well, no worries there, because all are good. My only complaint about this cd is that one of my favorites 'Country Song' is too short! I am sure there is some artsy explanation for that, which I wont understand! Country Song, to me, has a very 'Simon and Garfunkle' tone to it. I am old enough to remember them when they were new, so I am an oldster who really likes Jake Bugg! Buy this, with no regrets! Good job, Jake,I hope you have continued success! Btw, found you on Purevolume, in case you are tracking that sort of stuff.
B00007GZQI|4.0|Truly a product of its time, it is wacky but poignant, a little cliche', a little bit naughty, but certainly fun.
030758836X|4.0|This book has a bit of a slow start but stick with it... takes some real twists and turns that are unexpected
B000L9EKL0|5.0|Lots of action, good actors, interesting story line (based on a true story), and positive view of American Military personnel.
B0084670FU|3.0|It was a long drawn out movie, but in the long run it left with thought.  I was left with anger for the Americans 1st and the others in round about ways.  This movie shows how the actions of one can cause a butterfly effect around the world.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was an amazing series that made me want to never stop reading. I was actually close to tears at the end. I recommend this to everyone! You will fall in love with all the characters.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I just started watching Fringe and I love it. I got really tired of The X-files by its end, but Fringe brings this genre to a new level.
B00ARAO720|1.0|Totally unrealistic. Predictable and boring plot. This movie is truly terrible and would not recommend it to anyone who has a brain.
B009VB9VKY|5.0|The movie was great for adults and Not for children.  I know it asks you if you are 18 but under age kids will lie to see it if they really want to see it that bad and that really concerns me as a parent.  It really has suggestive sceens in it.  I rented it first to see if I would want it in the house with my Granddaughters in and out and I come to the decision it would not be a movie I would want in my collection that they could get a hold of.  For adults it is a great movie........but not for kids!
B00B4T0ZEC|3.0|I wanted to read this to make up my own mind about it. Darwin makes an unshakeable case for evolution, natural selection and the origin of species. He was an amazing observer of nature. However, it is a \\"dense\\" book; there are no wasted words. It's somewhat difficult to read, and it's LONG, but I can see why it had the impact it did. I can only give it three stars because of level of difficulty. When debating evolution, my first question is now, \\"Have you read it? I have.\\"
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I enjoyed this book but it was extremely dark. It took me about halfway through to really get into it and then I couldn't put it down! If you liked Gone Girl, you will enjoy this book as well. I can't wait to read her third novel.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|What an amazing movie. Beautiful story line. This movie makes you want to believe in magic again if you have forgotten. The actors were fantastic. Please rent it, buy it (buy it) and remember the absolute joy of being a child. Please give this movie a chance. I am not sure how much this movie was for children or to remind adults of their childhood innocence and wonder. Enjoy.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The book moves along with great twists and turns and keeps you interested all the way to the end. The end leaves a little to be desired and there are moments when credulity is required but who cares?
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Complex blast from the past. My generation will remember this crisis again as it is so very well depicted. Very edgy!
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Gripping for the first hour.  Good watch.  Don't watch on a plane though. If you Love Denzel you will want to see it.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|What I want to know is why is the kindle version $7.99 when he wrote this as richard bachman-the paperback is what 3.80? Doesn't make any sense
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids love this game.  It keep them entertained forever and I feel like they are being creative and using their brains.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Factual, exciting. Direction takes you back to relive events as they happened. The movie was suspenseful, gripping and held your attention to the very end.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Language is an elegant tool of communication, for touching the hearts and minds of others. So when I saw the title of this book was &#34;The Martian&#34; and the entire blurb consisted solely of &#34;The adventures of an astronaut stranded on Mars&#34;, I had to have it.<br /><br />Wonderfully, Mr Weir's unshakable confidence that his story should stand alone (without anything so mundane as marketing) is entirely justified. The Martian was a joy to read.<br /><br />Stranded in a terrible situation, astronaut Mars Watney is brave, upbeat and heartwarmingly funny, although at times he comes across a bit like a male Bridget Jones. As a pocket survivalist I was with him every step of the way as he struggled to turn a fatal disaster into a triumph.<br /><br />Not short on science, The Martian is definitely a book for those who like their laugh-out-loud spiced with intelligence and fraught with tension.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I have not read the whole book yet, but to me Chris is just an average guy with a God given talent who uses that talent to the best of his ability. You may look at a sniper as a cold blooded killer, as a disabled veteran I look up to snipers as men who kills the enemy before they can kill you.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|Interesting movie with a twist. Easy to follow and the characters were complex yet normal in this time period piece.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really enjoy this show for the outlandish premises around which the program evolves.  Don't know if this will be the case in future seasons, but a big plus for us is that one does not need to see every single episode to understand what the heck is going on.  It does help and does make the show more enjoyable, but if watching with a guest or someone who missed a show, each episode can stand on its own.
B006S08RLU|5.0|the movie was great. my connection was not. but it is the story that shines through regardless of the quality.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and absolutely loved it. It was the perfect blend of sweet, funny, interesting, charming, touching...I can't say enough good things about this movie. The performances from the entire cast are wonderful. I haven't been this impressed with a movie that touches all aspects of what good movie should be in a very long time.<br /><br />That being said, I don't know that this movie is for everyone. There are some parts of it that may be shocking or distasteful to more conservative-minded folks and its odd humor may not sit well with everyone. Unfortunately, there's nothing I can compare this movie to in order to give you an idea if you might like it...it's just that unique of a movie.
0316001821|3.0|I've heard such rave reviews about this book, it might have set me up for failure. I really never got into it, and struggled to finish it.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I adore Josh Groban not just for his vocal talents, but also because of his sense of humor and tongue-in-cheek self deprecation. So I will admit to a heavy bias where Mr. Groban is concerned. I loved the songs on this album (admittedly some more than others), but I think the songs are very catchy and easy to listen to without sounding like all the pop dreck (MY opinion) out there today.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not as interesting as the first two books. Our heroine is more subdued and less agressive than usual.The story line was not as interesting and the ending was anti climatic!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I'm highly addicted to this show. I just started watching it and needed the newest season ASAP so this has been great to be able to purchase episodes. The buffering at times is inconvenient and annoying but overall it's great
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The story just keeps getting better and better. The characters and those playing them are perfect.  And I absolutely adore Maggie Smith as Violet!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find myself playing this game for hours at a time. It is addictive and fun. The game has outstanding graphics, great hints and just a lot of fun.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Loved the Harry Potter series, but this one just could not grab my interest.  Maybe I'll try reading it at another time, though.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|This was one amazing tale!  The author gave us a true image of life in parts of India; for that I applaud this story.  But, the way she kept us &#34;wondering&#34; and breathless for the next clue made it hard to put the story aside.  With my love for &#34;happy ever afters&#34;, I felt some sadness that she never actually got to see her grownup daughter, but the ending was realistic and satisfying. (Oops; hope I did not give too much away!) Character development was totally gratifying; I could relate to them on so many levels.  Well done.....
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Beautifully executed, an evening of adventure, laughter, a doggie's antics, and just plain fun. We enjoyed it and hope share it with our grandson. Great movie!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game and its probably the best temple run ever<br />and it's not a regular game you won't see every day
B001992NW4|5.0|First things first:  This 3rd party seller was fantastic.  Not only did this collector's edition of \\"The Exorcist\\" ship fast, but it was unopened.  There was a some tearing in the cellophane of the packaging but, holy smokes, did the seller beat my expectations.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version of this film is beautiful.  Watch the extras-- it was a painstaking process.  Another quick word on the extras-- there are many, and such an excellent compliment to \\"The Exorcist.\\"  I refuse to spoil anything-- watch them.  For new and previous fans, these extras are fantastic.<br /><br />I wish all of our classic films received this level of attention and care when transferred to Blu-ray.  The quality of the original is not altered, but rather, I think, more closely resembles the writer's and director's vision.  Watching this on a widescreen plasma television, lights down low, is an incredible experience.  More technical details of the process by which the film was converted to Blu-ray is at this url:  http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Exorcist-Blu-ray/2250/<br /><br />In my teens, I bought the film on VHS.  Later on, I saw the re-released version in the theaters.  When the simple DVD was available, I happily purchased it.  And now, after all of these years, this is the version that, without hyperbole, brings \\"The Exorcist\\" to life.<br /><br />Extras are important, and if they are worth it, as a consumer, I will happily add the product to my collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It is so fun and I love to play it.I don't really see any problems with the game.In my opinion the game is really cool!
0345525558|5.0|The Language of Flowers is written in short chapters that alternate between the past and present. And what a lovely touch this adds! I started off feeling a little distanced from the narrator - frankly, she's kind of awful to everyone she comes in contact with. But as the book progresses, you learn more about her past, thus understanding her present. This is made all the better when she finally begins to let her concrete walls down and accept people into her life.<br /><br />Though the key relationships that develop are beautiful to see (in both past and present), there are some sad undertones that follow Victoria throughout her story. Even when Victoria begins to turn things around for herself, I felt this looming sense of doubt over how long the positive would last. Her past is just awful, and you get the feeling that she will never be completely comfortable with any kind of happiness. This touch brings the book from love and flowers and girly things to a deeper and darker novel - much more enjoyable if you ask me!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Amazing game. Lots of awesome hybrids, planting food for your dragons and best of all, DIAMOND DRAGONS.<br />Totally recommend this app!
B008XNZMOU|3.0|girlfriend loves a couple of songs on this album so I got it for her. After I ordered the Cd i got an e mail that allowed cloud play, so I played her a few songs to tease her, before the disc arrived for valentines day. The cloud play is a great way to enjoy the music of the disc and is a nice add thank you amazon!<br /><br />After listening to the entire CD its very much like modern albums, there is two songs that are good,(I knew you were trouble when you walked in, and we are never ever getting back together) and one that okay (red), the rest of the CD really isn't.  I could have saved my money and downloaded the two good songs and my girlfriend would have been just as happy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Yes, it's PBS and full of English people and based on life 100 years ago, but WOW!  It's just plain awesome!
B005LAIH2C|1.0|this movie was just as bad as i was expecting why would you make a movie about two fairy tale that kill witches this is more stupid than abraham lincoln vampire hunter
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Danial Craig is a poor James Bond. There was not much of a story. Looks like they just wanted to kill off Judy Dench.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|The paperback version of this book on Amazon is $8.27 currently.  Kindle rip-off versions of books get one star from me.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you can remember where you were and what you were doing upon receiving the news about JFK being shot, then this book will have extra meaning for you. I am one of those people - 6th grade home room.<br /><br />After a long absence from reading King, and being fascinated with the premise of this book, I was waiting for Kindle price to come down. Finally...<br /><br />Reading this reminds me of \\"The Stand\\" or \\"IT\\", because it totally grabbed me and would not let go. I took every possible opportunity to read, and grew hungrier as I got closer to the end. When I could not read it, I thought about it. Pondering the possibilities and absolutely not having any idea where King was going next cost me sleep and participation in other activities - including work!<br /><br />Having finished the book last night, I am still pondering it. Wondering what I would have done given the situations that were presented to the main character, Jake. Also hoping that King picks this up again and runs with a sequel, or another time-travel \\"adventure\\" for Jake.<br /><br />Total entertainment.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Unfortunately I read Gone Girl first, which was amazing. Of course I wanted to read Ms. Flynn's other work, so Dark Places was next. The premise of the story is gripping. I enjoy a clever murder mystery read. The characters are compelling but my biggest disappointment with this book was how little empathy I felt for them. Any of them. I realized early on that I was not going to connect with Libby. I was searching for some other character, any of them, to want to root for in a way. All of them were extremely unlikable, even the young sisters. I was probably more bothered by this than I should have been. Some aspects of the book were a bit gratuitous (animal cruelty) and I had to skip over some of those pages. I grew up on a dairy farm so it was upsetting for me. The last 10% of the book was very fast paced, but when the mystery was revealed, although shocking, I was left scratching my head. SPOILER ALERT = Why was this character introduced in such a strange, almost dream-like way? It was odd.<br />I gave a 3 star rating because it was suspenseful and well written.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games series is something that I thought I would never have an interest in at all, but after reading the first one, I couldn't wait to get this one.  That one last sentence in each of the first and second books ((I'm still reading the third) is the &#34;gotcha&#34; line The story is captivating and but light enough to enjoy.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Great fun, as always. I really enjoy the way they perform their music; it's wonderful to relax or dance to.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really liked this book very well written. Super super super. I bought it for my nephew since he wants to go in the military, I'm sure he will like it.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|George Martin is favorite author. Tug Voyaging only makes that more clear to me. The stories presented all have intricate moral backdrops, but Haviland Tuf, SPOILER, alw<br />ays comes out on top. I only wish the series was continued or revived. Tuf truly wields his power in interesting ways and<br /> is one of the quirkiest and most weirdly lovable fiction characters out there.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is one of the best movies That I have seen in a long time! Even though you may know the outcome, it is still exciting and ver well done!
B00991TCOG|5.0|exactly what i wanted. Timely received. Brand new. No complaint and would recommend for anyone to buy. All good. Thanks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app os cleverly made, and easy to use in any situation. Because you don't have to tilt it to move, you can play it on the go without worrying about bumping around. It's easier and much more fun than temple run. I give this five stars, and wish it could be more! (Play this game!)
B000AY74OG|4.0|The show has some very funny parts to it.  Although the lion biting the zebra would normally have a real falling out of friendship.  Worst thing is just how hungry did the lion get when it never had food that it could eat.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Son downloaded this program on the Kindle to see how easy the process was.  No problem encountered.  The game is known by the grandson.
B007CDGAQQ|3.0|This was for my son.  He has enjoyed the game.  He was a little disappointed in the ability to play with others.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The price is simply amazing for what you are getting here.  Excellent Movies and packaging.  The Bu-Ray quality is quite good.
B000Q79HS8|3.0|This movie is all right. The action and intrigue are entertaining. The character himself is not really that relatable, though.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I was skeptical at first since the second season doesn't continue the story from the first, but once I watched the first season I was hooked.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|I thought this was a very enjoyable movie. The ties to the Marvel/Avengers universe were a lot of fun. Also, those who complained about Banner's seemingly new ability to control his hulk-outs in The Avengers should do their freaking homework and watch this movie first.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Both the book and film were satisfying and made one feel optimistic about what old age could possibly be like.  However, the characters and plot have been changed a lot.  What remains are the rich concept and the nuanced interactions of the characters.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. gives another outstanding performance. And Sam Rockwell is a delight. This movie ties in well to the Avengers mythology. It does crowd a bit too much into the movie though, making this better as a chapter in the Marvel/Avengers saga than as a stand-alone movie.
1439152802|5.0|As with all other Kate Morton books, I pre-ordered this on my Kindle to be downloaded as soon as it was released, and read the entire thing practically without stopping. An entirely enjoyable read that kept me guessing until the end!
B003QTUQGU|4.0|Tim Burton was a natural pick to direct something like Alice in Wonderland. The movie doesn't really follow the plot of the books or the animated Disney film, but it has plenty of nods to them, and a fun story.
0307341550|5.0|I was unable to put it down. The descriptions were precise, visual and without gore. the story of all three women, so carefully intertwined by mental illness, is very telling of our times. a wonderful book.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|The casting was wonderful. The action is great. There is humor, excitement, emotion. Nothing is bogged down too much. It's like a Star Wars movie with Star Trek characters.<br /><br />And they managed to reboot the series without erasing anything that came before.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play this game every chance I get!!! Truly addictive!!!!! I am so happy that I found this game!!!!!Love It!!!
B00130UFY2|3.0|This movie continues the franchise. It has great action and suspense, but it is hard to relate to the main character (Jason Bourne) who essentially has no personality.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Super great cd. Catchy tunes and great to just sing along with in the car. Remindes me of summer rides down the country roads
B000Q76K1A|4.0|This was such a cool concept for a movie. It was fun sharing in Bourne's surprise as he realized what he was capable of. Amazing action sequences and a gripping story.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Let me put it this way, if you have evere been bullied in your life, this movie is for you! (and for everyone else too) if youve been bullied this movie shows you that things get better! and that life is full of surprises, besides that, its beautiful and enjoyable! id say that this had to be in the oscars!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This soundtrack makes me appreciate the movie even more. I wasn't terribly impressed with Russell Crowe's performance when I first saw the movie, but he's starting to grow on me. This musical has great music, and I really like the new song added for the movie (&#34;Suddenly&#34;).
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was a very interesting book.  I really like it because it was a love story with a twist. Great Book.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|This book offers a fascinating look into the twisted society where R.A. Salvatore's most beloved character was raised. You get to see how he was raised, how he was destined for more than that, and how he overcame the odds stacked up against him to become a morally good hero.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie for James Bond's 3rd outing in the reboot.  Classic Bond meets the new era.  Awesome movie!!!  Can not wait to watch it again!!!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love it, there were so many shows I had missed and I love that I can watch it when ever I want and re-watch.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The very first thing this app does when I click on it is open a web page for the Land Rover.  This is the most obtrusive ad EVER.  AND  it takes a while to load.  UNINSTALLED.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It is alot of fun to play with my friends and keeps me on my toes and be creative (fun).
B00A80SHFM|5.0|If you love the movie you will love the CD. My family can't stop listening to it all day long.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I joined farmville on facebook, in the last several months it is no longer fun to play.  With all the pop-up and multiple task that stop you from doing what your doing it has taken all the fun out of it.  I know several people who no longer play these games or have given up on facebook all together.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Great reading. Couldn't put it down.  Another great one by Mitch. Loved the characters in the story and a great ending
B005PK56TA|5.0|Hands down favorite series I'm into right now.  I'm going to keep it short and sweet, but I typically HATE all things horror and I could not stop watching this show.  There is so much suspense, romance, gore and of course, sex.  It is perfectly described as a psychosexual thriller.  You will not regret watching it.
0307744434|3.0|as has been said by most reviewers, this book is 80% description. plot is straightforward and very predictable. the main characters are very flat and the supporting characters were more fleshed out. i liked the Clockmaker more than any of the 2 protagonists.<br /><br />it is a terrible insult to JK Rowling and Susanna Clarke that this book has been compared to theirs, though I understand it is just a marketing ploy. all too often, marketers would try to dub something the next \\"Harry Potter\\" or the next \\"Twilight.\\" This book doesn't really do justice to either HP or JS&MN. it is even worse that the publishers have thought to release the book in a poorly edited form much like Twilight has been. i think this is an intentional ploy to capture the Twilight readers. would also explain why the hype went before the actual merit. the marketers were hoping the sappy romance in the book would be enough to stimulate the same phenomenon Twilight had.<br /><br />read it if you are a visual reader. but if you are a plot-guy, like me, you will be left hanging especially after that ridiculous resolution the author called an ending. an entire chapter was devoted to moralizing and tying up loose ends through exposition. i kind of agreed with one reviewer when they said the twins' story would've been more interesting.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It's a fun game and all. But it lags way to much. And it makes it hard to play the game.
B008476HBM|5.0|Enjoyed the book very much. The characters were well described .<br />This was a book club selection and I will probably read more of her books in the future, time permitting.
B00B780TAK|5.0|This show got me at season 1.  After hearing so much great reviews i started season 1 and continued on with such anxiety.  I cried at some episodes, laughed at some episodes and grew more and more anxious to see where these brilliant characters evolve.  i love the time set it is in from season 1 to season 3.  The costumes to the cars and the homes are breath taking.  I can not wait for more.  This show is Truly an must see and MAGGIE SMITH is amazing as always.  She fits the role as violet so well.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|i love time management games but found this one to be very boring.  Removed it from device almost immediately.  Sorry
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a great game to play with your kid's, or with friends to see how fast they are.. Fun
B007REV4YI|5.0|We love Daniel Craig as Bond, and this is our favorite of his movies!  We love all the throwbacks to old school Bond, and watching it on Blu-ray is almost as good as seeing it in the theater.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|First book is by far the best but collins keeps you guessing until the very end! Would recommend but just not right before bedtime!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Great notepad app that lets you have reminders to go along with the notes.  Nice for grocery lists and the like.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book blew me away. I was expecting a typical love story, but this book went way beyond that. It has so much depth to it that I immediately fell in love with Sky and her struggles. The book was suggested by my sister whom I highly value her opinion, but honestly, I didn't think I'd be into it much. Boy, was I surprised. I \\"live\\" it..  if you're looking for a good, suspenseful read, this is your book.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Wonderful restoration.  I especially loved the fourth disc that had the interviews with the stars and information about the making of the movies.  Wonderful.
B008WK30XO|4.0|First time I heard the Bootleggers was when I saw Lawless. Stayed for the credits to find out who did the songs. I haven't been disappointed. Though, as others have stated, there are repeats done a little differently, but all in all some really good tunes if you like mountain music which I do.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|I was really hoping to find a movie player for my Kindle Fire, and all description of the app said it would.<br />Waste. Disappointed.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I'm a long time fan of Captain America in the comic books, so I was almost certainly going to be a fan. This is way better than a comic book. I loved the main storyline.<br /><br />It was a little weird that all but 5 or 10 minutes of the movie was one long flashback. I don't want to give away anything - but they could of skipped all the present-day stuff - and ended the film with the first scene - and I'd have been happier. The very last scene left me with a sad feeling, though most of the movie was very uplifting.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I have to give it up to HBO for providing the second season of Game of Thrones on pretty much every format with this product.<br />You get:<br />Blu-Ray disc version<br />DVD disc version<br />Digital download code for iTunes, Amazon Video, or Ultra Violet.  The iTunes code I redeemed was an HD download too, so that was nice.<br /><br />I really appreciate that HBO has included all of the formats one would care about in the same box.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is way better than the first one and has so much adventure and suspense. You'll love this book instantly
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I am really enjoying this show set in a small English town which is more or less run by the postmistress.  Without any new episodes of Downton Abbey to come for another year, this show will give you another side to Mr Bates.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love thee game if you like Temple run you will like thes game. by: Karlee Jane Wright age Eight
B004QX07G4|2.0|I rushed through this book because it was off the wall.  I love Ellen but didn't like the book.  However, the very last chapter was good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is fun, but sometimes it doesn't load properly, unless you shut down and restart your kindle. prices for horse tack and other near necessities also seem unbalanced.
B004ZJZPXO|4.0|Good story line, great for those with imagination and keen science fiction fans and as a fan just love this,thanks
B008476HBM|5.0|Once I got back into Jan Austen's narrative style, I enjoyed the book as much as I had when I read it many years ago.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo definitely earned the Oscar for the best movie of the year because it is one of the best movies that I have seen and it is an accurate account of what really happened in the Iran hostage crisis. Everyone knows that the ending is a happy ending. Everyone knows that in the end, they will be safe, but it is such a good movie, that, even though I know what is going to happen, it still makes me nervous and tense. The movie is very intense and will have you holding your breath all of the way through, even though you know the ending. It is that good of a movie. It will become a classic and I predict that teachers will use this movie to help teach history.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really liked the book.  The ultimate innocent literally falls into the ultimate dom.  Ana meets Christian by accident, interviewing him for a friend.  He stalks her, and turns up where she is throughout the whole series.  When he shows interest, Ana is so excited, until he introduces the contract.  Ana is so innocent, she has no idea what to do or even think about it.  She ultimately decides she can't live without him and accepts what he has to offer but she still has reservations and ultimately wants more.  The classic story of opposites attract and the consequences.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book I liked a lot. I was taken through more twists and turns than a mountain road. Amazing ride. Best book of his that has grabbed me in quite a while.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|My least favorite in the series.  This book begins with Ana and Christian coming back together.  Christian contines to try to control everything and Ana continues to resist.  She ultimately makes him so angry, he walks out of her into the arms of Ms. Robinson.  Ana ultimately feels betrayed over his reaction and thinks this might be in end!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Makes your smartphone into a kindle e-reader.  Works just as promised.<br />Great for those times you get caught waiting without your e-reader.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Ultimately, this book has more action than the others, Ana risks her life to save what will be her family.  This book is a heartwarming ending for the ultimate tortured child.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter loves this app I think it's great it keeps her attention and I recommend it for other young kids who love horses
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was about a girl running away from her past unto the arms of the ultimate bad boy.  They have a lot of problems and hers definitely aren't relatable but in the end, it's a good read.  Can't wait for his prespective out in April 2013.
B007MDK4XQ|5.0|Hitchens delivers as always, with personal honesty, intelligence and deep insight.  He handles his own dying process with courage.  An immensely useful book.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Liked this drama from the first episode and it just keeps getting better and better.  Can't wait for the following seasons and more edge-of-the-seat viewing.
B004IOVGW0|5.0|This film really took me back to the 50's... the picnic scenes were wonderful!  Great acting from the biggest stars of the day.  A must-see classic.
B0086DBE62|3.0|With the stars in the movie it should have been really good but alas it wasn't.  I'm glad I didn't pay money to go see it at the movie theatre.
B005JE7XW0|5.0|Wash from Firefly playing a redneck, in a horror movie that turns everything upside down? I wish I could give it more stars.
0671646788|5.0|What I really enjoyed about this one is how much it has stood the test of time. I'm not sure exactly the year it was written--mid 1950's, I think. This BIG thinking may not be in vogue so much today, but there is nonetheless, a lot to learn from it. Making allowance for the intervening 50-60 years, anyone who is building a business today will appreciate the content of this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Con: N/A<br /><br />Pro: Easy read.  I went through the entire book within a less than a week.  I enjoyed it.
B000004166|5.0|Of course these compositions exit in zillions of recordings and there's a lot of taste involved. This recording is very &#34;real&#34; and at some points more &#34;naked&#34; &#34;than polished beautiful&#34;. Recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Good ending. Now I just have to wait until November to quench my thirst again when the next movie comes out.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show has been a seemingly accurate travel through history and I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a historical drama.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this is such a fun way to play. I really like all of the interactions with the horses.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show has been a seemingly accurate travel through history and I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a historical drama.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Learning curve was there on how to shift the cube, then off and running.  Interesting depth for a game to play.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book makes so much sense and has really made me reevaluate the 'roll' that wheat plays in my menu planning. Have taken their recommendations and hope to see positive results.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing. I absolutely loved it, and I think this was the best ending I have come upon in a book. There is some tough content in this book, but I loved it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this series! Simple stories, but very well written.,A great series to look forward to watching after a stressful day!
B008B11R1Q|3.0|Unfortunately this album was not as good as the XX's first album-- this one was so consistent in tone that I got rather bored. It worked as gentle background music, but couldn't really hold my attention so well if I tried specifically to just listen to it. The songwriting isn't as good either-- they've used repetition in ways that jar rather than emphasise (which they were amazing at in their first album-- repeating a line and giving it a different feeling every time they did so) and their lyrics are much simpler and more generic. Don't get me wrong; there are some good songs on here, but an album's greatest challenge is to keep the listener enthralled with one artist for the entire duration, and for more than one listen. This album just didn't really achieve that for me.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a great game with awesome graphics! I love how I can transition between realms. I'm at the point in the game where I now need to pay to move forward, but considering I really like the first half, I'm sure I'll love the second half. Hope you enjoy the game as much as I have...now I'm off to start the second half of my jouney!
B002N1AEN2|5.0|The XX has an original, beautiful sound and this album manages to keep a consistent sound but have enough variation to keep the listener interested. This is for people who enjoy chilled-out, poetic music. Pretty much every track sounds like it would make a great soundtrack as well. The songs have this great way of evoking a story in your head.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Great twists. God book has more depth than the movie. I would recommend this book over the movie. Great read
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game for kids.  My son loves playing it and I am so glad we ran into it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! It is harder and a lot more fun. My brother got this game so I did also.I believe that we can both agree that this is one of the best game ever!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Definately worth watching - keeps you at the edge of your seat.  I highly recommend this movie and it won best picture for a reason
B003KK65KG|2.0|The first 200-ish pages of this book were good. After that, it got worse and worse. The chapters were slower and slower. Some of the parts seemed unneccessary. By the end of the book, I was so ready to be done, I skipped 40 pages. I just wanted to find out how the book ended. Honestly, in those 40 pages I skipped, I don't think I missed anything. I also didn't like the twist at the end.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Way of Kings opened strong and kept me hooked until the end. Sanderson's world is a strange and fascinating place. There are shell creatures and grass that hides to avoid being stepping on, people with features such as marble colored skin and powerful magic swords and armor that can turn ordinary people into nearly unstoppable warriors, the list goes on.<br /><br />I should mention that the book is long, around 1,000 pages. However, the book is a epic journey; one that you won't regret making. I highly recommend it.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This movie is okay, but it's slow and I wasn't overly impressed. I wouldn't rush out to rent it. Maybe save it for a lazy Sunday afternoon.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|needed for class  received on time and in great condition.  if you need it and they have it buy it. You will get what you pay for no doubt.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|This is like Goldfinger/Shirley Bassey s*** here, too good!  Even my 8 year old can't get enough hahaha.  How do people WRITE this stuff?!?
B008MEM24S|5.0|My grandson enjoys playing this game on my Kindle when he visits :) He played the free app first and then I decided to get this one<br />for him and he is enjoying this too!
B0053O89Z6|5.0|They are starting to run out of their freshness but still a quality show. This was a pretty funny season though.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I downloaded this for my grandson so he can play on my kindle when he stays overnight, etc. at my home
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wonderful series, would highly recommend it to everyone I know!  Can't wait for the next book to come out this summer!
0439023483|5.0|If you liked the movie, you'll love the book. The book is always more detailed and you can envision scenes in the movie as you read the book or the other way around. The movie will be a treat after you read the book. Either way works for this one.
B00BESLT6G|1.0|I loved the first movie. I could not wait for this one to come out. I should have waited. I need to watch the first one about 20 times to get this one out of my head.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Amazing series...I was hooked from the beginning.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.  I was skeptical at first but now can't wait for 3rd season
B001TH16DI|4.0|it may be my player, but the lips don't always line up in the dialogue. the picture and sound quality is great. watching the original trailers is cool - it reminds me of the movies before they were all re-done.
B007M45PMU|4.0|This is a nice cd. I think it's got something for everyone to enjoy. I was happy with my choice.
B00006CXSS|5.0|i loved this movie, it was a great war movie and had an awesome story to go with it. you really get into the series- thats the downside is you'll blow a whole day watching it.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Very cute story... the main character was very likable...even though I pretty much knew early on how it would end, it was still an enjoyable journey...I would recommend this for a fun, relaxing read.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Each version is better than the last. This is a great free game. Gameplay is great on the Kindle Fire
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abby is one of the best series I've seen in a long time.  I recommend it a must see for all.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is hard to believe this is a free game.  Looks and plays great on the Kindle Fire.  A real winner.
0060751967|4.0|This book promises that the series will be worth reading. So far the story has left me intrigued by their world and purpose.
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie not only has comedy but also tries to add suspence.  The characters are well formed and have excellent personality for animation.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|I can't tell you. I see no difference. I loaded it, but I can't get it to work. I can't load flash either. This could be a problem with Kindle...can't tell.
0345525558|5.0|This book was chosen by my Book Club.  I ordered it from Amazon and upon arrival, I read the first page to see what it was like.  I never put it down!
B000P0J09C|5.0|Thumbs up. Recommend this movie for adult viewing only. This is not a kid friendly movie. Need to watch it more than once
0151003084|2.0|I thought this book would be a bit bigger than it actually is. It's about the size of a CD case. That's not my issue with this book however.<br /><br />I love the drawings and black humor, but I'm severely unimpressed by the quality of the printing. The paper is thin and cheap feeling, like standard copier paper. The pages are single sided (because the paper is so thin).<br /><br />I was hoping to give as a gift, but the cheapness of the paper stock and production quality is making me have second thoughts. I would pay more for the book printed on heavy paper stock that doesn't show through.
0446563048|3.0|Haven't read the book yet so I don't have any real comments to share regarding the content of the book
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was the first of any of these type of games I've ever played &amp; have been playing it for 2 hours straight! Love the story line and the mystery of it. Will definitely be getting more like it.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|After playing both Lep's world one and Lep's world two, I decided that the first one was better.<br /><br />First off, it doesn't glitch as much as the second world. This isn't to say that it doesn't glitch at all, it just doesn't glitch as much.<br />Second, it doesn't move back or forward when you stop. It stays in one spot which makes it a lot easier to see what you're doing.<br />Third, I like how the first world doesn't let you skip to the next level. It makes it more challenging and if you're playing for the first time it makes it harder to put down because you want to know what comes next.<br /><br />There are some good qualities and bad qualities in the second world too.<br />First, I like the fact that you can wall jump. It added a very nice touch to the game. It also made it easier to get to places.<br />Second, I liked the fact that I could swim in the water. It made it fun and exciting, but it was also a little frustrating because I wasn't able to hit the enemies that were floating around because of the button problem (I'll get to that next).<br />Third, the buttons were harder to use. I would push jump and I would throw a pine cone! And if I attacked someone, I wouldn't be able to continue walking afterward.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend the first world. It was easier to use and didn't have as many glitches as the second world did. I gave it four stars because of the problems that need to be fixed.<br /><br />Note: I liked both of the world's, but I prefer the first one more. Enjoy playing! I know I did :)
B003MC5N28|5.0|It had me in shock<br />The details were amazing I couldn't put  it down the author did a great job
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is a free game and my 5 year old grandson loves playing it. It is fun and challenging for him.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|Gorgeous scenery and breathtaking heartland landscapes in H D along with a great cast and sound track...a super tramp adventure
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Played this on my laptop and got the Kindle version when it was offered. Fun way to pass the time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love anything Nicholas Sparks and Safe Haven was another book that i loved from the begining to the end. I know that a lot of people can relate to this book in away, from running from an abusive husband to finding someone that cares enough not to care about your past and to make you feel SAFE when your around that person. This book was just as AMAZING as all the other Nicholas Sparks books. He caputres the reader from the begining and tells the story of how this women broke out of a abusive marriage where she didnt have anything to being able to find this guy who would show her just how much she can be loved with out being abused.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|My daughter and I started a winter bookclub...northern winters are a tad looooon, and this was the choice for the second month.  It is a great choice for a group as there are many issues to draw out and discuss, sorting truth from the fantasy.  Enjoyed the characters, book seemed too short!  I think a sequel might reveal other issues.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is seriously great television. No show on right now beats it. So convenient via Amazon Prime, too. Highly recommended.
044024367X|1.0|I hated this book.<br /><br />There is definitely a formula to Lee Child's books, and I enjoy them.  But this time it was awful.  Reacher spends the duration of the book bouncing back and forth from one uninteresting small town to another, and the climax was pretty anticlimactic.  There was only one other fleshed out character in his sidekick for this book, everyone else was cardboard.<br /><br />If you are into the series, I'd recommend skipping this one, you won't miss much.  All respect to Mr. Childs, but it was pretty dull :(
B0073CCYAM|4.0|This is not what I expected.  I was expecting a normal diecast vehicle.  This is actually 1:64 scale, not 1:48 or even 1:55.  It is tiny!  They don't really tell you what size it is, I suspect for a reason.  It is a bit misleading.. but.. hey, they didn't say it was bigger and it's a well-made diecast so the fault actually was all mine.<br /><br />Fool me once, though, Amazon sellers!  I won't make the same mistake again.  I will equate a lack of information with something bad in the future and let someone else write this type of review.<br /><br />There isn't actually anything wrong with this car, though!  It's a cute little diecast.  It just doesn't go with the rest of our son's collection of cars.
