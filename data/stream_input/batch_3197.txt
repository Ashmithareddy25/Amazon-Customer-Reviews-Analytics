B004FRX0MY|5.0|Perfect app for phone.. Makes it so easy to download songs and store on my galaxy note 3 and also transfer and download to computer and put on cd or mp3 player.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Long time Jamily member here...this album has really grown on me.  I would now consider it the best since Yield...(not that any in between were bad!)  Getaway, Pendulum, Yellow Moon, Lightning Bolt, Swallowed Hole are stand outs!!  Sleeping by myself should have been left on EV solo album (small beef).  Saw them live in OKC play several new cuts and was just great.  Highly recommend.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|This item was as describe and it has infinite possibilities to combine your skiil and colors to create what your mind desires.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It goes without saying that the book is a lot better than the movie. The fact that it's entirely from the pov of the main character really allows you to get to know her and understand how she feels after being thrown into such a situation. Overall, it's a highly recommended read.

0385523912|4.0|Ms. Demick has written a bitter account of struggle, survival - and finally escape from - Peoples' Democratic Korea.  The hunger, tyrannies great and petty, and squalor her protagonists suffered are sad and seemingly pointless, graced only by the victory of new lives elsewhere.  It got me contemplating the context of the DPRK; and while not detracting from her book, her account to my mind doesn't go far enough.<br /><br />The tyranny and poverty of these defectors' lives does not differ in substance from that lived by millions of other Third World residents in Asia, Africa, the Middle and Far East.  Why is North Korea &#34;special?&#34;  Because, of course, it's one of the last unfallen dominos of the Cold War.  Labeling these cruelties as products of &#34;Communism&#34; marches in tandem with nuclear proliferation and barbed wire on the DMZ.  Recounting the entrenched, grinding poverty and hunger in India draws no book awards; describing the refugees from the uncivil wars of Central America as similar defectors draws only outraged frowns.  Contrasting the grim existence of North Korea with the neon sufficiency of Seoul supposedly underscores the difference between the Kim family's slave state and the Free World of the RoK.<br /><br />Of course, the American taxpayer subsidized the South's postwar recovery and &#34;economic miracle,&#34; while the North is a victim of the rustbelt deindustrialization that has struck the former Soviet Bloc, Europe, and North America.  Even had Korea remained united the North would still emerge as a depressed region by the 1990s.  Aside from the devastation of the war - when the US literally bombed the North into the stone age, a holocaust still glibly ignored by the majority of Western opinion - the DPRK is an anachronism in another way.  We've forgotten the feudal lives of our ancestors, when existence for most was indeed nasty, brutish and short.  The tradition of Korea as a &#34;Hermit Kingdom&#34; ruled by a godlike emporer survives in the DPRK.  We can see the past for what it was, beyond the stereotypes of the Cold War and the romantic fantasies of medieval Samurai.<br /><br />This leads to speculation on the North's future, when its people are &#34;finally free.&#34;  Will their lives substantially improve, even if the North goes the way of East Germany?  Those millions can't all flee to Seoul or China.  Is the South (and the US as its protector) able or willing to deal with them?  Turning the former DPRK into a free-trade zone for exported widgits will still leave millions behind in hopeless decay, as in &#34;reformed&#34; China.  If the North Korean present is bleak, its future might well be an abyss.  Besides focusing on the evils of the &#34;Kim regime&#34;, how to make the real lives of its people something to indeed live for?  Let's hope this is more than the unregulated steroid of &#34;free market democracy&#34; the West has injected into other charity patients, then leaving them to stew in the aftermath.ves in the DPRK.

B009NH6AOQ|5.0|It arrived a day after it was estimated to ship!The package was in excellent shape,no dents,marks or scratches.Paid %80 off the store price for this whole season.I love the walking dead,the show is VERY addicting,haha.Glad I got to add this to my collection.
B00CNGA1PS|2.0|I just bought a Samsung phone, so I'm used to an iPhone and the iTunes Pod cruncher app. This app plays the podcasts fine, but it's maddening to do simple things like delete episodes. It automatically downloads the last 100 episodes when you subscribe to the podcast. Getting rid of those episodes so that your play list is manageable is a chore. In fact, after messing with it at least 3 different times for 30 minutes at a time - I still can't get them deleted. I've tried marking them and pushing the trash icon and even changing the settings to delete episodes older than a week. Nothing has worked. They're still there. I also think it's clunky to get around in. Too many screens to get to the play list. I think I'll try to find another podcast app.
B00C5XBAOA|4.0|this item was as advertised with all the characters included. it came brand new in a sealed box. this product is good
B00EI4V3X2|4.0|Light, somewhat, uh, how do I say it delicately?, lets say 'inexpensive construction' feeling headset that at least for now still doesn't work completely wirelessly with the PlayStation 4 that it seems to want to be paired with (and which I want to use it with).<br /><br />Realistically, the completely wireless (or lack thereof) issue is more Sony's than anyone else's.  At release, the PS4 doesn't support any Bluetooth devices except the DualShock 4 controllers.  No Blu-ray remote controls.  No DualShock 3 controllers.  No other PlayStation 3 peripherals.  No Bluetooth headsets.  None.  Zilch.  Na-da.  That will hopefully be fixed over time, but for now any thought of being able to use any of the Turtle Beach headsets wirelessly with the PS4 are out the window.<br /><br />When used with a PS4, at least at the time I'm writing this review, this headset has to be connected by a small cable that is connected to the DualShock 4 controller *if you wish to use the microphone for chatting* while using this headset.  You can use the headset to listen to game audio, movie or video audio, etc., without the need to connect the cable, but if you wish to chat through the microphone on the headset you'll have to be wired to the controller.  The cable is included with this headset (along with other accessories, including a charging cable that is used to recharge the pre-installed rechargeable batteries that are in the headset), so there is no need to buy an additional cable, but given the price point for this product it seems pretty silly to even have to note that.  Really, at the price this device sells for, it shouldn't require any additional accessories, or at least none that would involve the need to spend any more money.<br /><br />The Quick Start guide that came with this headset was fairly sparce and didn't actually provide instructions on how to configure this device for use with my PS4.  I was able to easily find the full User Guide at Turtle Beach's website.  I wish that it was included in the package, but I don't really mind being directed to the website to get a soft copy of it.  The user guide does provide instructions on how to adjust the chat volume (which is done through the menus on the PS4, not on the buttons on the device which only work when the device is used in Bluetooth mode).  That is something that I would very much have liked to have included in the quick start guide, but again, the information is available in the downloadable user guide.<br /><br />As best I can confirm, the microphone mute function, at least when using this device wired rather than in Bluetooth mode, simply doesn't work.  I don't know if Turtle Beach simply blew that, or if it is a limitation of the way they've had to engineer a temporary solution for using this device with a PS4, but it is disappointing as I like being able to mute the microphone when I don't want to be forced to use it.  There are buttons to control the microphone/chat volume, but they don't work when using the headset connected in a wired mode.<br />-- edited to add:  visiting the manufacturer's support forums shows the mute and chat volume function problem is being experienced by other PS4 gamers as well, with (thus far) no response received from the manufacturer.  Attempting to connect to the manufacturer's live support chat via the internet proves itself to also be a somewhat frustrating and time consuming experience (I had hoped to check with the manufacturer's support team to see what their stance was on the button functionality, or lack thereof, but seem to be meeting a dead-end there).<br />** Updated again (12/5/2013) : confirmed, the chat mute buttons and chat volume buttons only work when using the headset via Bluetooth, not when using the direct cable connection that is currently required with Playstation 4 systems :-(  If/when this headset can be paired with the Playstation 4 over Bluetooth then users would be able to mute the microphone, but until then, muting themicrophone is not possible when using the chat cable connection.  The manufacturer might be able to (and hopefully would) correct that with a firmware update, but as things currently stand the mute button for the microphone is basically useless when using this headset with a PS4 system.<br /><br />Also added later:  I had meant to be a bit more clear in my review noting that this headset is not just a PS4 headset, rather it can be used with PlayStation 3 (PS3) consoles as well as Xbox consoles, or even used mobile with an iPod, iPhone, or other smartphone for music playback and such.  While it might be assumed that this headset is meant only to be used with PS4 consoles, that is certainly not the case.  Perhaps the problem in that area comes from the thought that Turtle Beach uses so many different names and numbers for their products with so many of them having somewhat overlapping features and compatibilities that it is nearly impossible to know which headset would work with which consoles. :-(<br /><br />Over time, I expect Turtle Beach will improve the product and the feature set will be fully fleshed out.  Once it does, then I would say these are nice headsets.  Not quite as nice as some other headsets that they offer, but not bad.  Four stars for now.microphone is not possible when using the chat cable connection.

B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|The extended version was excellent.  Story line closely follows the original book.  The movie is very well done.  A must see to remind you of where the characters are before the next movie comes out.
B0012GMUIG|5.0|This is not just one of my favorite Billy Joel albums, it's one of my favorite albums - period.  Truth be told, I recently repurchased this item even though I still had an older CD in my CD rack -- mostly because I wanted to have the AutoRip-ped tunes added to my Amazon MP3 library without me having to exert any additional effort ;-)  (Laziness wins for me, and rang up another sale for Amazon and Billy Joel)<br /><br />Songs in the Attic is classic Billy Joel.  The style and sound from Songs in the Attic is close to the same as early Bill Joel fans would hear when listening to the definitive Bill Joel album The Stranger.  Taken together, those two albums leave me hours of listening pleasure with songs that I know by heart.<br /><br />Personal favorites on this album are Summer Highland Falls, and the Ballad of Billy the Kid.  You're My Home and I've Loved These Days also easily take me to my own happy place (as would She's Got A Way).
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Great story; great interweaving of real people in history with fictional characters. Really enjoyed the science I learned. Alma, Ambrose and her father were memorable characters. Highly recommended.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|He was a SEAL alway the way thru.  Doesn't seem necessary to elaborate.  Anyone who loves our SEALs and also reads about them will love this book.  It will bring tears to the eyes of anyone believes they are a patriot.  God bless our SEALs.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|I don't know why I love Rock of Ages so much.  It's the kind of movie that's enjoyed best late at night and two drinks in.<br /><br />But I do; I really, really do.  I can't get enough.<br /><br />Julianne Hough is mousy and a little lost in her role, Diego Boneta tries so hard to make this his breakout movie, and Catherine Zeta-Jones and Tom Cruise overpower the rest of the cast.  It's the kind of movie that the stars in it will make fun of on a late night show 10 years from now, and not entirely out of shame because it's also the kind of cheesy, over-the-top, unstoppable flick that is destined to make it a cult favorite.<br /><br />It's full of 80's hair-band mash-ups like \\"[[ASIN:B0087650UO Juke Box Hero / I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B008765770 We Built This City / We're Not Gonna Take It]]\\", which are the catnip of GenX.  Fortunately these manage to be worked into the movie without seeming too Glee-ish, so kudos to the director.<br /><br />Rock of Ages won't win any fans of film critics, who will be aghast at the directing, acting, and overall cheese.  It will addict those of us who thrive its quirks and flaws.  It's my new [[ASIN:B0000524E5 Coyote Ugly]].
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The best SEAL related book I have read.  The book Fearless is #2.  Chris Kyle was 2 things.  A Texan and a SEAL. He truly<br />believed in what he was doing.  His sniper ability was unbelievable.  A true countryman.
B007REV4YI|2.0|I'd tell you this has spoilers, but by giving it two stars I hope you'll spare yourself watching it anyway.<br /><br />In Skyfall we find the world's greatest special agent relegated to the role of a fool, as in truly imbecilic.  For example, when being chased, Bond takes M to a home in Scotland where they can see the enemy coming for miles.  After an 80's-style [[ASIN:B000SQFC2M MacGyver]] montage in which Bond and company booby trap the house a la [[ASIN:B00008N6NQ Home Alone]], they then hang out and wait for the baddies to come.  Now there's an escape tunnel which they eventually use, and you'd think the world's smartest secret agent would use to set himself up a nice sniper nest BEFORE-hand, but you'd be wrong.  Fortunately the bad guys are every bit as stupid, pulling right up to the house then walking through it setting off trap after trap, even though they could've surveilled to their heart's content because, as mentioned, the house is on a flat and you can see for miles.  Combine that with the RAF's twice-too-late timing, some unacceptably bad firearm play, and a director addicted to crane shots and that gives you a taste of how poor this movie is.<br /><br />Now there are some classically-clever Bond lines in the film; and the scene in which Bond lands on the torn-in-half train, straightens his tie, and keeps walking is iconic.  And I get that's it's Bond, not Bourne, so it can't be taken seriously.  It's just unfortunate to me that the build-up is the promising premise of two masterminds playing chess but the bulk of the movie is of two Hollywood actors making the least tactical decisions possible.

B001NLL93W|4.0|City of Glass is the third book in the Mortal Instruments series, featuring shadowhunters, demons, vampires and more supernatural creatures. Clary is still looking for a cure to wake up her mother and seems to believe that the cure can be found in Idris, at the hands of a warlock called Ragnor Fell. Despite Jace's urging her not to go, she creates a portal into Idris, which is where the shadowhunters mostly resides and enters. She finds danger as Valentine tries to pull down the demon towers and enter in search of the final Mortal Instrument, the mirror. As the final battle with Valentine goes down, Clary and her shadowhunter friends, must fight for their lives.<br /><br />I read the first two books in this series some time ago and really enjoyed them. It was only for other book series that I haven't continued on. As part of my &#34;listen to more audios&#34;, I listened to City of Glass on audio, and fell back into the world of shadowhunters and downworlders. Downworlders are the supernatural world of vampires, fae, werewolves and warlocks and are looked down upon by shadowhunters. Valentine Morganstein is our resident bad guy and is determined to try and rid the world of downworlders.<br /><br />Of the three books, I definitely liked this one the best. I liked being pulled back into the supernatural world and I love the name of the cities, like &#34;Alicante&#34;, the City of Glass, and Idris. I like how Cassandra Clare has created a world of shadowhunters, who hunt demons, and the downworlders. All the magic and mythology is very fun.<br /><br />I've had a bit of a love-hate relationship with Clary and Jace. They are supposedly brother and sister and sure don't behave like it at times. In City of Glass the question of whether they are brother and sister is finally resolved, and I was happy to see that this book doesn't end in a cliffhanger. There is a definite ending, even if some things are still left up in the air. One of those things is the extent of Clary's power. We see a bit of it in this book but I'm sure there will be much more to her power in the next series.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to YA supernatural fans. Some of it's concepts are unique, and I am looking forward to moving onto the next trilogy that follows.ower.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|As many other readers have stated, this book falls short of doing any justice to the conclusion of this trilogy. I don't want to beat a dead horse so for more explicit reasons of just why that is read any of the other 1 star ratings and it is laid out more clearly. In fact, some of these reviews were more thought provoking and In depth than the plot of Allegiant. I 100% agree this book has ruined the trilogy for me. It does not explain the storyline of the factions or &#34;what lies outside the fringe&#34; adequately and feels more like a forced explanation. It does not at all feel authentic to the first books. I would have preferred there not even have been a third book and have had the series end without ever having explored the outside world. It did not sufficiently add to the storyline or give meaning to the theme of the series. I also agree that the dual perspective of this book was confusing to read as both Tobias and Tris were narrated in the same voice.<br /><br />It is also a shame to say this but after reading this book I am not looking forward to the movies. Overall a disappointment. I had such high expectations for this book after reading the first two.... Sadly I was left feeling unimpressed and without closure. I was once a huge fan of this series, recommending it to all &#34;looking for a good book to get into&#34;. After reading this book I don't feel that I can whole heartedly say this anymore.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very good return to the book which introduced Grisham to his readers.  None of the books after &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; was as good as that one; but every one is worth reading.
B000FC146C|4.0|BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN saga by a wonderful storyteller who amazingly covered the lives of interesting characters and the Australian outback, grabs the reader's attention throughout
0547258305|5.0|Graceling, a fantasy by Kristin Cashore, is an excellently crafted novel that manages to incorporate action, romance, survival, and powerful underlying themes in one attractive package. Katsa is a girl born with a Grace, or an extreme skill which separates her from all others. Her Grace is killing, and she is forced to work as a pawn for her ruthless uncle, King Randa. Katsa meets Po, an exotic prince, who helps her break free of the chains of control she had been held captive in. They embark on a journey across the land. This elegant and provocative odyssey creates a deep and mesmerizing world that places it among the best romantic novels out there.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I was happy to learn that there is a positive and caring book about Michael Jackson and that is &#34;Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy.&#34; Thanks to the author!
B005USZYDU|5.0|My daughter bought this book for her Ipod, she is currently in 6th grade.  She loves the John Grishman books for kids.
0786838655|5.0|This book is a fast adventurous read that your tween won't be able to put down. If you have a reluctant reader this book may be the one that turns their reluctance to read around. The nice part is once they get interested in this book and it's characters, there is a whole series of Percy Jackson and the Olympians to read and then other series by the same author. So there will be lots of reading ahead!<br />It's also nice to know that the author Rick Riordan is a former school teacher and is bringing those old dusty myths back to life for kids!

B00992CF6W|4.0|Hello I'<br /><br />m Jayden  I think this game is ok for me because it needs more things added to it.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Great Series for all us Zombie lovers.  Way better than most of the dumb Zombie movies that come out.  Thank god for the Walking dead.  My favorite show.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This is the most well put-together collector's edition packaging I've ever seen--the barrel feels hefty and well constructed, the disk trays are great, and the show is pretty good, too. I wish some of my other favorite shows would put together a set like this.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|Another favorite of mine.  Great and unusual twist to this film.  I really enjoyed it.  Anthony Hopkins is always awesome.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I am always excited to be transported to another time in history. Great writing. On to book two. Thank you
B004RJMUJO|5.0|What a perfect time waster.  Totally easy to play, good for short spells where you need to kill a few minutes, and the challenge of beating your high score keeps you coming back for more fruit slicing.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Paints a vivid picture.  Nice detail in descriptions, both locale and character.  It's true, there's nothing to envy in this situation for so many good, hard working people.  You get a bit angry at the selfish government, totally lacking concern for the people's welfare, while continuing to brainwash.  The country has been taken over by selfish, power hungry thugs lacking any strategic vision for their country or the people.  Really sad.  The book gives good insight, is very fast paced, and you just wish there was something you could do to help but so many others have tried and the change will have to come from within the country itself.  Just a matter of time...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive and fun to play, can be frustrating and challenging, wish life was unlimited tho :) then it would be perfect.

I don't know what type of router other use, but this didn't work for streaming from my iPad to the Chrome device. If you use your wireless router for everything in the house, and you try to stream with an iPad to this thing, good luck. You better have an excellent wireless router for this use. I stream from my PC which is physically plugged to my switch and then use the wireless to stream to the Chrome device, that's the only way this will work on my network. Oh, and I've been in IT for 25 Years, K.
1623650003|2.0|This tale was way too over the edge for me. What could have been a good detective story soon turned out to be, in my opinion, too over the top weird.
0345803507|2.0|I did not finish the first book and haven't touched the other two altho I bought all three. The first one, &#34;Fifty Shades of Gray&#34; was so poorly written and repetitive it got annoying. It had a few moments of true wonderful humor but not enough to keep my interest. I may eventually try to finish reading the first one then (at a friend's prompting who read all three) read the other two. I understand the hype surrounding the books considering the content but I am surprised at how poorly at least the first one is written.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The idea of reading a romantic, pre-teen, twilight-esq book made me hesitant to start but my enjoyment of the movie gave me hope. I'm glad I did, it was easy to read and the suspense was well integrated even though I know the story based on the movie. The book was better than the movie and I look forward to the rest of the series.
B00H2UFHBI|5.0|Three great books all in one place. A thrilling collection.<br /><br />OUTVIEW:<br /><br />I don’t usually read YA but something about OUTVIEW drew my attention. It has an original plot that has been expertly woven. Strewn with spiritual and fantasy elements, entwined into a contemporary setting and populated with well drawn characters. OUTVIEW is an engrossing read which I would recommend to anyone, whether a YA fan or not.<br /><br />OUTIN:<br /><br />After thoroughly enjoying Outview (The Inner Movement) Book 1I could't not read 'Outlin'. This is a great continuation of what's building up to be a classic fantasy series. 'Outlin' starts directly where 'Outview' left off and hurtles you along the story. Again filled with wonderful characters and great spiritual and fantasy concepts 'Outlin' leaves you gasping for air and eagerly awaiting the next thrilling installment.<br /><br />OUTMOVE:<br /><br />The third instalment of Brandt Legg's thrilling Inner Movement trilogy doesn't disappoint. Filled with adventure and well rounded characters, &#34;Outmove&#34; takes us on a spiritual journey through time. A wonderful climax to a gripping trilogy as we follow the members of The Inner Movement as they battle against the evil organisation &#34;Omnia&#34;. Beautifully written and packed with unique concepts and riveting action &#34;Outmove&#34; should not be missed.
B00FR0GT9Y|3.0|I really didn't have high expectations for this release.  After listening to it a few times, I must say that I do like it better than &#34;Corporate America&#34; but nowhere near as good as &#34;Walk On&#34;.  And you can't even compare this to the first three releases at this point!<br /><br />I am a bit surprised that Tom Scholz would even allow these songs to be released in the way they were recorded, being the &#34;perfectionist&#34; he seems to be.  It's not that the songs are bad because some will catch on after a few listens.  What really irks me is the cheesy drum machines that are used and the overall processed sound/production.  The instruments sound synthetic and fake .  Yes, there are some decent vocal performances and guitar work.  But most will be left &#34;Feelin' Unsatisfied&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;Heaven and Earth&#34; and &#34;Last Day of School&#34; are probably the best tracks on the CD.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is awesome!!!  It looks so simple, yet it's not.  You have to think about the moves - how to open gates, find jewels, how to get the pearls in the less moves as possible.  I love this game!!  The background music is very soothing.  I highly recommend this game!!
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Came exactly as advertised. No scratches on any of the DVDs. The quality is okay but nothing is ever perfect. I love this series and have watched is multiple times. I recommend buying this set versus individual seasons. Makes it much easier for storage and accessibility.

B00DCRE83S|5.0|If you love Metal, the roots of metal, alternative metal, old school metal, this Album delivers... if you like Bands like Alice in Chains, Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, you will get into this... I love putting this mother*&^%^&* down on my turntable and letting it rip...
B00BETX5PS|5.0|The whole Bond series starring Daniel Craig has been great.  I prefer the direction much more than previous Bond portrayals like Pierce Brosnan.  Casino Royale WAS my favorite recent Bond movie.  Quantum of Solace was okay, but a little slow after the nearly out of control Casino Royale.  Skyfall ups the ante and cranks the action to eleven.  The villain is great, the action is great, there's typical humorous quips throughout the movie, and you really get a little deeper glimpse into what makes Bond tick.  I don't buy movies very often.  In fact, I rented this one after seeing it in the theatres.  However, this one is definitely on my buy list, and if you have a Blu-Ray player, make sure and pick it up on Blu-Ray.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Great game for the price, and easy to play. I really like the collecting aspect as well. If you enjoy DC characters then this game is for you
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Ok, not bad. I expected better. The beginning was a little bit confused. I guess I need to read the book first.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game for kids. Downloaded this game for my daughter to play. She loves it. Easy to play &amp; lots of fun.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Baldacci - Patterson - Sandford...!!!!!!!!!!!  only books for me!  all three authors are Great ! they develop the characters..and have series.. of book!  the innocent is Great!

B00H2UFHBI|5.0|OutView:<br />This book was incredible! Action packed and full of energy, you'll quickly like Nate and his friends, and follow him on his journey into SO much more than you ever imagined.<br /><br />This was such a refreshing change from other paranormal/sci-fi reads. The concept is a new, original take on reincarnation. The book moved along at a nice pace, keeping the reader's interest held throughout.<br /><br />I can't wait to follow Nate and Dustin on the next part of their journey! 5-Stars and highly recommended for anyone looking for an awesome paranormal adventure!<br /><br />Outin:<br />A spectacular, vivid journey<br /><br />Following Nate Ryder on the next part of his journey, Outin leads the reader on an adventure into a world not too far off from our own. While Outin itself is a spiritual oasis, the rest of the world has fallen to commercialized wasteland, and it’s up to Nate and his friends to save us all.<br />Reaching deep down, Author Brandt Legg captures a world that could easily be seen, and at once entices and scares the reader. The few rich controllers of society don’t want Nate and his friends to unveil the powers that lie within all of us.<br />Outin shows us not only the possibilities of what could be, but also the possibilities of what each of us, as people, are capable of. It’s a refreshing read, with a heartwarming message that you won’t be able to put down. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a well written adventure. Don’t forget to start with OutView to get the best experience possible.<br /><br />Outmove:<br />Currently the final installment of the series, OutMove is the culmination of Nate Ryder’s spectacular journey into spiritual enlightenment. Author Brandt Legg takes you through this series and leaves the reader with a sense of tumbling down the rabbit hole, or choosing the red pill in lieu of the blue. (Really, who wants to wake up in their bed, full of blissful ignorance?)<br />Not only will this series entice the reader and refuse to be put down, it opens a part of you that will have you questioning everything that you thought you once knew. It’s not only a refreshingly new, well written story, it’s a tale that parallels so closely with so many of today’s issues, it can almost be considered a wakeup call.<br />You will fall in love with these characters. You will laugh, cry, find love and heartbreak in this series. Start with OutView, then Outin, and finish up with this book. You will not be disappointed. I very much look forward to seeing more from Brandt Legg in the future. 5-Stars!

006202406X|5.0|I know there has been a lot of controversy over the ending, but even though it was terribly devastating; it was real, and beautiful. I know that if a book can make me cry that much, it truly was amazing. Thank you Veronica Roth for giving me amazing books to read and look forward to reading. I can't wait till you write more of them.
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|I have been a loyal Scarpetta fan from the beginning.  The last 4 or 5 books have been disappointing to say the least, and I was hoping this one would be different.  I had to force myself to read this book.  It was awkward...too wordy, scatterbrained...just didn't flow well.  Scarpetta comes across as whiny, depressed and weak...so unlike the character we fell in love with.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Movie did very well to follow the story line. I didn't like how it was shot &#34;with an animated&#34; filter as I loved the book. For those who don't want to push through the book it is a good alternative.

B004JN1CW4|5.0|this was an awesome book. It had a great ending, even though it was kind of tragic. I loved the characters. I really enjoyed kinda sorta love triangle between Brenda and Thomas and Teresa. This book is well written, and very thought through. I would recommend this book to people who like action, adventure and a little bit romance. Although, I wouldn't recommend it to people under the age of 10. One of my all-time favorites!

B004ZG5EYC|5.0|I loved it. I identified in some ways with the title character so I understood immediately what this movie is about. Some don't get it...oh well. Delightful and soothing and funny at times. Some quirky stuff was a little weird (collecting discarded photo machine photos?) but I didn't let that stop me from enjoying the entirety and refreshing originality of this film. Life should be so simple again.
B0090SI582|1.0|I ordered this DVD through Amazon and I received a counterfeited copy of the movie. I contacted the MPIAA who confirmed all the movies I received form Amazon were counterfeited as well. Check your DVDs that you get to make sure you have not been scammed like I was.
B00G3HSF7O|2.0|Elysium is a deeply flawed movie. It reminds me of the Star Trek (original series) episode, \\"The Cloud Minders\\" in which the cloud city is beautiful, cultured and peaceful and all of that is paid for by the dirty workers on the planet below. Elysium has a substantially similar plot and some fine actors, Matt Damon and Jody Foster do their jobs well. But Elysium wasn't written by Star Trek writers.<br /><br />The movie does not seem to be well-thought out. The costumes are weirdly anachronistic, Jody Foster is wearing what corporate big wigs would wear today, Matt Damon wears old torn tee-shirts. The violence is predictable and so over-the-top that it becomes boring.<br /><br />There is a large mistake in the movie titles which tell us that this movie is set in the far future 2154 -- more than one hundred years from now, but at the same time, it takes place in the 21st Century -- hey dude, that's our century! 2154 is in the 22nd Century, that should be obvious to the movie makers.<br /><br />The main characters don't show any development that leads them to their final denouement. Matt Damon's starts out selfish, is selfish throughout the violence and decides at the end to be a hero. Jody Foster's spends her time keeping the bad elements out of Elysium in an entirely selfish manner and doesn't change at all until suddenly at her character's end. This leads to the plot feeling disjointed. The movie goes where you expect it to go, but it doesn't really allow character development to get there. I got the feeling that Matt Damon knew he could have been a part of a better movie, but he's a professional, so he kept plugging along.<br /><br />If you liked him as Jason Bourne, you will probably be disappointed in this movie.
B00005LOUP|2.0|I'm sure I will get flack for this review but I did not think some things were appropriate for children in the movie. There is one part in the movie where two older women are explaining where the Grinch came from. He comes down in his umbrella and is hanging from a tree outside the window. Meanwhile it shows through the window a Christmas party going on and people are walking by playfully spanking eachother while others are dropping their keys into a fishbowl. (We stopped the movie after that.) Seriously with the spanking and the keys it makes it look like a swingers party. And what is with the skanky looking neighbor with the lights? Anyways, I can guarentee our daughter wouldn't pick up on any of it but I didn't think it was appropriate which is why I gave it a lower rating;

B007C4ZJ3K|2.0|Hey Ted Fry!This movie has more 1 star reviews than 5 star reviews for a reason.As much as I like Gina Carano, she is terribly wooden in this film.(a film with a stellar cast and director to say the least.)And while I would like to see Gina Carano as say Wonder Woman in the future, it does not dismiss the fact that this movie fell flat primarily because of her lack of nuance in the acting department.P.S. men are &#34;really&#34; sick of seeing women kick their arse in movies, in real life that doesn't happen!(except say &#34;WonderWoman&#34; or another movie where there is a reason they can!)
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I loved the fact that this book takes a wide view of a short period, covering events and people we all know about<br />but really haven't put in perspective.  It gives a better view of the period. I always appreciate<br />Bill Bryson's humorous view of things.  This book kept me going with no dry points. A great read even if your not<br />a history buff.

B002G1YPH0|4.0|A very large heatsink and can combo, so make sure you have room inside your PC's case to accommodate it. Very quite. The only downside I can find is that I needed to remove the motherboard from the case to attach this device's mounting bracket. Depending on your PC's case you may or may not need to do so, too. If you're a modder you already have the skills necessary to install this fan/heatsink.

B00AOEA22I|4.0|W.E.T. - Rise Up<br />Written by The Rock Man<br /><br />In 2009 one of the albums of the year came from a band called W.E.T. This was a collaboration between legendary vocalist Jeff Scott Soto (Solo/Yngwie Malmsteen/Talisman), lead guitarist Robert Sall (Work of Art) and bassist/keyboardist Erik Martensson (Eclipse). The band name itself is an acronym for the three bands they play in, Work of Art/Eclipse/Talisman – W.E.T. At one point Soto described the project as a glimpse at what a Journey album would have sounded like if he recorded with the band, and indeed it did. Any time you put a group of talented musicians from various bands together to form a super group expectations are naturally high, when W.E.T. delivered their debut album in November 09 it didn’t disappoint.<br /><br />Since then each of the boys have been busy with their respective careers, but 2013 see the band come together to release their second album titled Rise Up. This time around the band has expanded its ranks to include Robban Back on drums and Magnus Henriksson (Eclipse) on guitar, and the result is simply A-Class. I have been a fan of Jeff Scott Soto forever, in my opinion he is one of the premier hard rock vocalists in the business and this album does nothing to change my mind, his delivery is silky smooth, passionate and powerful.<br /><br />Rise Up is a twelve track album that kicks off with the very radio friendly Walk Away, again, we can reference Journey of recent years here, the difference is the guitars are slightly heavier in tone. The next track is Learn To Live Again, which is the first single from the album and you can see why, great keyboard melodies, solid grooves and a very catchy chorus. From here we move to the title track, Rise Up, now I think the title track of any album should come out swinging and knock you on your butt, and this track does exactly that. Love Heals is your standard garden variety power ballad as is Still Believe In Us, however the albums strength lays in tracks such as What You Want, The Moment, On The Run and Shot which are all solid, punchy rockers.<br /><br />What W.E.T. do very well is remind us what good music is about, it’s simple escapism. They are not trying to redefine the genre, but simply play to their strengths which include good song writing, solid musicianship and a simplistic approach. The signs are clear that with each album this outfit is growing in strength and I certainly cannot wait to see what future releases this classy band has in store for us.lays in tracks such as What You Want, The Moment, On The Run and Shot which are all solid, punchy rockers.<br /><br />What W.E.T. do very well is remind us what good music is about, it’s simple escapism.

B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Stryper - No More Hell To Pay<br />Written by The Rock Man<br /><br />Heavy Metal isn't for everyone ... and that's fine, some sub-genres like Christian Metal, for example, are for even less. I love metal music and I am a Christian, so for me it makes sense to combine the two. When I tell people I listen to heavy metal music, this uneasy look of disgust/horror comes over peoples faces without fail, it's as though people think I'm going to eat their children or something, of course this comes from decades of stigma about metal being \\"The Devils\\" music, seriously have you heard a Pink record, then you can talk to me about \\"Devils\\" music.<br /><br />Whilst it is true that there are those who like to sing an ode to the horned one, for the most part metal bands are too busy gloating in song about there sexual conquests, and then on the other hand there are those that like to pay tribute and praise to a higher power. One such band that has been unapologetic about their faith is Californian metallers Stryper.<br /><br />While bands such as Motley Crue, Ratt, Van Halen, Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P and others were trying to make a name for themselves on the L.A. circuit in the early 1980s selling their message of sex, drugs and rock n' roll, Stryper were out there also, but they were selling a different message, one of faith and praise to God. For three decades now that message has stayed the same and along the way the band has developed a strong loyal following inspired by gospel masterpieces such as Soldiers Under Command, To Hell With The Devil, In God We Trust and Murder By Pride. Their latest offering, No More Hell To Pay could possibly be the best of the lot.<br /><br />In terms of sound, No More Hell To Pay takes the band back to its early days recreating the vibe of classics like The Yellow And Black Attack (1984) and Soldiers Under Command (1985). Guitarist Oz Fox is on fire, his playing on this record is simply amazing, bassist Timothy Gains also puts in a top class performance. Then there are the brothers Sweet, Michael on vocals and lead/rhythm guitar and Robert on drums. Robert has been among my favourite drummers since I first heard him in the early 1980s, his style is like a battering ram, solid, commanding and a perfect execution of time keeping. At the risk of sounding corny, Michael's vocals can only be described as `Angelic', but unlike some in the industry that rely on pro-tools in the studio to make themselves sound better than they are and then fall flat live, Michael can deliver in the studio and then back it up on stage, I know I've witnessed it for myself, in addition his lead guitar playing and soloing is out of this world.<br /><br />No More Hell To Pay is a heavy piece of work. The band have resisted the temptation to put on the record a couple of commercial or radio friendly style tracks in the vein of Calling On You or Always There For You, instead opting for a much more harder, edgy approach. Pound for pound, Stryper are every decibel as heavy as their more commercially successful counterparts. The opening track is Revelation which features a catchy guitar hook, thunderous drum groove and a strong melodic vocal arrangement, this sets the pace for the rest of the album. The title track continues down this route and is very reminiscent of their early beginnings, while Saved By Love is a full on pedal to the floor rocker. Jesus Is Just Alright, originally recorded in 1966 by The Art Reynolds Singers, gets a Stryper-ized make over and is a seriously fan track, the only track on the record that comes close to being labelled a ballad is The One, and this is a nice addition. However it isn't too long before the full on headbanging recommences with Legacy and Marching Into Battle, the latter seriously could've been a throw away from the Soldiers Under Command recording sessions. Further down the track listing we come to Sticks And Stones and Water Into Wine which are two definite highlights, the album rounds out with Renewed and I couldn't wait to press play again.<br /><br /> I'm not going to try and convince everyone that No More Hell To Pay is a must have album because like a said before, this sort of thing isn't for everyone. However, if you've been a long time supporter of Stryper then you'll know the quality of this band and the quality of their work and it goes without saying that you'll want to add this gem of an album to your collection.ewed and I couldn't wait to press play again.<br /><br /> I'm not going to try and convince everyone that No More Hell To Pay is a must have album because like a said before, this sort of thing isn't for everyone.

B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|Volbeat - Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies<br />Written by The Rock Man<br /><br />So the other day I am talking to a colleague and she says \\"Have you checked out Volbeat\\", to which my response was \\"What on God's green Earth is a Volbeat?\\" It kind of sounds like a Danish kitchen aid and as it turned out I have one part of that correct, the Danish part. Volbeat are a Danish metal band that formed in Copenhagen and released their first studio album The Strength/The Sound/The Songs in late 2005. The band would have success on the Danish music charts with their debut album reaching No. 18, however this was just the start as the band's second album Rock The Rebel/Metal The Devil (2007) would debut at No. 1. In 2008 the band would go straight to No.1 on the Finnish music charts with the release of their third album Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood and in 2010 the band would release their next album Beyond Hell/Above Heaven before headlining the Download Festival in June of that year. They would also join Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer on the \\"Big Four Tour\\" as the opening act at a show in Switzerland.<br /><br />So this brings us to 2013 and the newest addition to their catalogue Outlaw Gentleman & Shady Ladies. Not having heard a Volbeat record before I really didn't know what they were about and honestly after listening to the album, I am still not sure. I'll explain, Volbeat simply cannot be labelled as a metal band and left at that, because what Volbeat do is incorporate a variety of other styles of music into their brand of metal. Anything from rockabilly to country, from rock to thrash metal and even schlager music, which is prevalent in Central and Northern Europe. The only other band I can relate to along these lines is Faith No More, with their fusion of rock/jazz/funk/metal.<br /><br />The record begins with Let's Shake Some Dust which is an instrumental of wild, wild west proportions, if you close your eyes and listen you can imagine Clint Eastwood or John Wayne in a good old fashion shoot `em up scene. From there the album launches into Pearl Hart, the first of many odes to gunslingers, this is a pretty catchy hard rock track and you might find yourself singing this one all day. The Nameless One features a really cool spaghetti western flavoured guitar solo, while it tell the tale of a couple who have passed into the afterlife and try to escape the from the Outlaw Ghoul. Dead But Rising is a heavier track, as is Room 24 which features guest vocals from King Diamond, personally I found this to be the weak link of the album. The Hangman's Body Count could have easily been a Metallica song, and speaking of Metallica, have you ever wondered what Metallica would sound like if they added a banjo? Well neither have I, however if I did I would imagine it would sound a lot like Doc Holliday, which by the title is pretty self explanatory if you are up to speed on your Wyatt Earp/American wild west history.<br /><br />All in all what Volbeat have created here is a really enjoyable 14 track album, that isn't quite a concept album, but does pay tribute on a regular basis to heroes and outlaws of the wild west. I cannot tell you about any of their previous work or compare this album to past efforts as I am arriving a little late to the Volbeat party, but in terms of this record I was quite pleasantly surprised at what I heard and I believe I would like to hear some more.John Wayne in a good old fashion shoot `em up scene.

B00GP0G0IK|4.0|This was a fun and challenging game, a bit costly, but finished it in an afternoon. Love to have a walk through for the more challenging mini games.
B00DERIV8Y|5.0|I love the size and the details are amazing. It is well worth the money. If you are a Daryl fan you will love it!!
B001JNNDGA|3.0|With all the hype about this film, it doesn't measure up to the standard spoken of and had no good dialog
B001EIOOV8|5.0|This is a very good movie for those that like a good gangster movie. Joe Pesci steals the show and DeNiro shadows.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|sad the songs are not all included, but if you haven't seen daria since 2000, its a great way to relive the past
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|A great product for those who are collectors and fans of Dr Hannibal Lecter, is a Blu-ray inevitable that all must purchase
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is how real Americans are . My heart hurt and I cried for the things these seals endured.i<br />Rules of engagement is insanity. If we send our guys in they should be able to do what they have to do.Awesome men in every sense of being. Thank God these villagers stepped up to the plate. God's hand is the only reason he survived . This should be read by every American so they understand freedom is not free. All the pride in the world is not enough for what these guys did.Awesome story. The most emotionally draining nail biting book I have ever read . May God be with all our guys.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|I don't know why such a good story and a supremely talented cast were wasted by the director and production staff. For 48 minutes the movie was B grade tripe and eventually got interesting. Even with Cheap props and an Orwellian, oppressed society theme (which is tired in today's cinema)... this was a potential winner.  My problem was the desperate attempt to channel The Matrix with knock off action and music which was corny and distracting. This movie should have been made to it's own theme and would have been another Matrix &#34;caliber&#34; movie. Unfortunately, the desperate &#34;cloning&#34; of the Matrix just made it cheap. The movie is worth watching but not owning IMHO.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Not bad. Would be better if it didn't nickle and dime you. But a pretty good sandbox game if you like building games.
B00BQ1D7BQ|4.0|This is an excellent CD!  Consider Stephen Stills is the only musician to ever get Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton to both play on the same album.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Great little game to play and pass the time away.  Enjoyable for all ages and pretty easy to score from.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I just got it to listen to KS/RP do the commmentary and it was a long time ago. 2 days later it was in the grocery story to rent for 1.00 so I learned my lesson. Oh I am going to need eight more words or so to post this so Here they are.
0321213351|5.0|This book paired with the GOF book is a deadly combination. I think this book is fantastic and has lots of very useful data. I don't believe it will go out of date anytime soon :). If you are interested in design patterns then this would be a good read to pick up. Examples are in Java, it is well written and references patterns in the GOF book, which is a great neighbor to this one.
0399213015|1.0|This was to be a bigger book.  It is so tiny that I am embarrassed to give it as a present.  The child is<br />to feel the book, but the holes are so tiny.  I would like to return it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The final book in the series really wraps the story up and still leaves a few surprises for you to discover!
B00GTZN0X4|4.0|Kids liked it, however I was kind of bored. To me it was just &#34;Cars&#34; with wings. It was a good thing we were watching it at home - I was able to stand up and leave the room.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Killer app. Keeps the spirit of the movie while adding to the experience. If you like the movie give it a try.
1573225517|5.0|A great read! An amazing insight into the male mind, his ego and the difficulty in letting go of the need to be &#34;in the game&#34;.<br />Translated well into the US film version, the book shop employees Dick and Barry steal the show.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I absolutely loved how Maggie easily switched from Grace to Sam from chapter to chapter. It flowed so well, especially at the end, it was breath taking. This book is beautiful, that's the only word that I could possibly think of to describe the whole book it's self. I never thought I was a crier but this masterpiece changed that. This book deserves more then five stars.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It works great for the very few apps it supports. I wish I could broadcast my phone screen instead.  I want to share my screen, not just watch movies and videos from my phone.
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|This book was a disappointment to Pendergast fans. It is a good read, but not one of the really powerful Preston & Child offers. Usually, they keep the reader guessing, but this time the action seemed forced and slow. Corrie is hardly the kind of character that grabs the reader, although she is certainly gutsy and pleasant. It was worth reading simply because our real leading man always comes through, and of course, did it again.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love this game. It is very calming and beautiful colors and interesting facts about the under water world. I recommend it highly.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Worthless. I never was able to download one video.NOT ONE! Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time with this junk.
B004MNVKVO|5.0|Don't listen to me, listen to this album.  Rush got better with each album leading to this one, which represents their peak, like in the Himalayas!!
B0081SRJSY|4.0|It's a great game overall, but the anti-aliasing on the tile graphics looked a bit rough. The zooming isn't very smooth, and I really wish there was online multiplayer.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this game is one of the best games I have ever played. it is a really fun game and the difficulties are a little bit difficult but there are lots of fun. GET THIS GAME AND PLAY IT RIGHT AWAY!
B00B5HQL50|5.0|A great movie! Not campy like some of the bond films, no magical equipment, just a good story, great action, good acting! Besides it's a bond film! I was a bond fan for a long time. Like others I have been disappointed with some of the bond offerings... But not this film. I think this is my favorite bond film now. I'm hoping there will be more with Daniel Craig, I am saddened by Judi Dench leaving.. I thought she was great as M...
0393307050|5.0|I have read the entire cycle of Aubrey-Maturin novels six or seven times--and I rarely re-read books. The characters are fascinating--flawed, driven, hopeful, evolving. The story line, and all the sub-arcs within it, are exciting, The writing is sly, engaging, by turns somber and light...Jane Austin Goes to War.<br /><br />Start here, with the concert in the Governor's music room in Port Mahon, and embark on a multi-year adventure that goes right round the world.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I can't say enough about Mr. Jackson!!<br />I didn't think I could ever get more excited about a performance until I saw this concert performance.<br />I'm trying to think how/where I was during 1988 when he was the King of the Stage....hmmmm can't really remember<br />I only wish I could have experienced this magic up close but I guess this DVD is the next best thing...<br />I will always remember Michael Jackson, and this is one of the many videos that keeps is memorary alive in my house<br />order your copy today and you will see what I mean!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|a powerful and poignant book.  the writing was poetic.<br />It was a unique and effective way of showing the horror s of the war.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Not bad seems a little easy hope more of a challenge as I continue. Kinda early in game to rate
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Goofy and funny - good performances by all actors. I put off seeing it, but it was worth it and I am glad I rented it.
0765334798|1.0|Simply awful.  Foolish and beyond plausible plot followed by almost 100 pages of ridiculous blogs.  Was only able to finish thanks to a 4 hour plane flight.  Most disappointing.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|The game is very fun and i enjoy playing it.kkd odododkdkodo fodkdkdkdkk ddododo download for free wifi and reached to be able and reaches of a story that the same way that power school and reached
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Really like this game slow at first to get you village built up . But a good game . The colors are vivid and pretty !
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|This is a solid tale that shows how life in the less-affluent South can be.  The title character is actually not the main focus of the film, but that's quickly forgiven as the character of Ellis has considerable depth and is very well-portrayed.  It does have moments where a little editing could have picked up the pace a bit, but overall it's a good movie for when you'd rather be told a good story than experience 2 hours of CGI effects.
B00DH7P6WU|5.0|Both dolls are amazing! They are very detailed, ecspecialy Hunter's boots. I love their clothes, Hunter's bag and Ashlynn's purse. A must have for Ever After High fans
B00CX7TOOG|4.0|It's rare that we see a movie like this.  Yes, there is graphic violence, including torture, which normally makes me say &#34;No Sale.&#34;  But the build-up between the two characters is so well done that I couldn't keep from watching to see how things turned out.  It's not gratuitous violence, but be aware that things get very rough.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent book - a real page turner  -  I read it in one afternoon - even though football was on - always a good sign for a bookl
B00A2H9P98|4.0|It's unfair to compare one movie to another, but when Hollywood gives us three movies about the government losing control of the White House, it's going to happen.  This is easily the best of the three.  If you are a fan of &#34;Die Hard&#34; type movies, it's nonstop action without being heavy-handed.  Check your brain at the door, of course, but it's a fun watch if you're in the mood a lighter action flick.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This book goes beyond a factual accounting of events in North Korea and helps us connect to the situation by telling personal stories of individuals who have lived through the oppression.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Did it again great book great series If you have not read this series do yourself a favor. Really have ejoyed all of them
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A decent game considering it is free. Perfect for those times you are stuck waiting for appointments or looking to kill several minutes.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading. The ending was bittersweet. I recommend this series. There was never a dull moment and really liked it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I wasn't sure about how the story was going but I would highly recommend this book.  The concept was interesting and the characters were believable.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I don't rememeber getting this app. so I suppose one of the kids must have done it thank you lol
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Just a great end to a very long story .  I will remember this for a long time.  Who will do a film?
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Too depressing.  I'm into happier movies these days, like Deliverance, or The Piano. Just kidding. The movie is well acted, well written and all that stuff, but I needs to laugh!
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I love these classic books!! They are timeless and never get old. Anyone can relate to the characters, and that's what makes them so amazing!!
1401917232|5.0|There are a few words in each of Gary's books that will change your life and relieve the crushing (but unconscious) burden of guilt that pervades our lives.  In his other books he provided a few really useful sayings (or prayers) to use when the world closes in on us.  I have found these short sayings to be life changing and invaluable for forgiving others (and, in reality, forgiving ourselves.)  In this book he has another great saying (or maybe a prayer).  This one is for forgiving yourself and it works great.  It goes sort of like this...I AM INNOCENT...NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED...THE HOLY SPIRIT KNOWS WHAT I AM...I AM AWAKENING IN GOD...<br /><br />The rest of the book is filled with all sorts of interesting gossip about the past and the future...but if you memorize that prayer and say it to yourself every time you feel bad about anything you have ever done...you will feel a lot happier...really...it works...whatever you may think of Gary...the core of his teaching is very practical and it works great...at least for me...he really is an inspired teacher...flawed as heck but, really, he can change your life for the better.  Read, laugh, forgive.
B002RKS81O|5.0|I love these classic books!! They are timeless and never get old. Anyone can relate to the characters, and that's what makes them so amazing!!
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Fun movie for the whole family...we all enjoyed it - great underdog story and has the humor of a typical Pixar movie.
0385341679|5.0|Ok so I'm totally hooked on ALL of her books!! I have to say Ms. Moning  is my favorite writer right now!! Her books will have you spell bound!! You will not want to put them down, trust me I know!! No joke her books are just that amazing!! No other series have come remotely close to beating this one!!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I just love angry birds! It entertains me all day long!!<br />Every level is lots of fun and characters are wonderful!

B003Y5H54W|5.0|Talk about Little Red Ridding Hood all grown up!! I think that's why I love this movie!! I was nothing like the kids book we grew up reading!!
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|Love the ease of downloading movies to her Ipad. Its great when she become obsessed with a movie.  This is a great kids and adult movie
B002RKSZKI|5.0|I love these classic books!! They are timeless and never get old. Anyone can relate to the characters, and that's what makes them so amazing!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a great sci-fi series.  I hate that they canceled the show.  It is truly original..a tribute to Joss Whedon's skill.  He's gone on to direct some fantastic movies.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Awesome!! My daughter and I absolutely LOVED the movie, I had to get the soundtrack for us!! We sing and dance around the house all the time!!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|After the back to back renaissance of &#34;Time Out of Mind&#34; and &#34;Love and Theft,&#34; Dylan spent five years on the road riding high on the reception to those two masterpieces. In Fall 2006, he released the long awaited follow-up, &#34;Modern Times,&#34; and once again, Dylan delivered.<br /><br />&#34;Modern Times&#34; builds on many of the same themes present on the previous two records, namely love, cynicism, and mortality. There is an even greater sense of doom than even on &#34;Time Out of Mind,&#34; with songs like &#34;The Levee's Gonna Break&#34; and &#34;Ain't Talkin'&#34; set against chilling apocalyptic backdrops that are among the darkest lyrics Dylan has ever written. Dylan doesn't shy away from his tender side either, as shown on the playful &#34;Spirit on the Water&#34; and the beautiful &#34;When the Deal Goes Down.&#34; &#34;Thunder on the Mountain&#34; and &#34;Rollin' and Tumblin'&#34; show Dylan can still pull of rockers, while &#34;Nettie Moore&#34; is one of his darkest and most haunting ballads.<br /><br />Special mention must be given to the astonishing &#34;Working Man's Blues # 2,&#34; one of Dylan's greatest songs and the best thing he's released since &#34;Mississippi.&#34; A beautiful tale of economic hardship, Dylan sings this one with great care and the backing is perfect.<br /><br />&#34;Modern Times&#34; is another essential entry in Dylan's catalog.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I really must be getting old. I was pushing myself to read the first book in this trilogy and as much as I hate to put a book down and usually give it a go this one just did not do it for me and I had to stop reading it. I think this was the first book I purchased for my Kindle and did not realize at the time that I did not need to download all three books. So two and a half books will sit on my virtual shelf and the only good news about that is it will not collect dust. I did not care for this and am sorry I made this purchase.
140053271X|3.0|Inside 9 months one button broke, another flips several pages when you pres it once, and, finally, it froze on me for good the other day. I'm getting it replaced under warranty, but I should've gone with another brand.

0425261360|2.0|SPOILER ALERT 1st & 2nd paragraph:<br /><br />The only thrill I got from this latest Cornwell/Scarpetta was finding out that the leatherback turtle was saved--a nice touch that Scarpetta cared so much about his welfare. It was about the only time I really cared about what was happening, and I appreciated that the book had some good information about this endangered species.<br />Other than that, thanks to everyone else for their thoughts & reviews--I thought I was alone in being so cranky about this book. I read it thru, but like many others, I wondered who the hell Al Galbraith was?? The text of the great reveal contained no reference to him--I was annoyed enough to flip back thru the book looking for the name--and finally found it. A minor character with no real part in the rest of the book. And we were supposed to recognize the name, without even a tiny hint? I'm surprised an editor didn't catch that.<br />Disjointed--a perfect word to describe this book. The bone bed--that subject disappeared for far too long after the introduction--never really seemed to be a part of the plot, even at the end.<br />Annoying--another good word--just what is it with constantly trashing Marino and Benton? Sheesh!<br />And that lovingly detailed, l-o-n-g workday gourmet breakfast scene, before Scarpetta & Benton leave for work?--did not that seem a tad unrealistic, to oh, I don't know, about 95% of her readers? Nothing wrong with a superwoman--just ground her in reality once in awhile.<br />All that aside, I'm been a HUGE Cornwell/Scarpetta fan since her 1st book--and this one was nowhere near being up to her previous standards. Cornwell's much too good for this. Maybe for her next book, it's time to bring back the editors with clout.

B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is fun when you're not exchanging 50 text bubbles with the other characters. After a while it just gets boring. Would be much more fun if the game makers had the ability to make the characters get to the point already!
B00632HWOG|2.0|I 've been using this for a while. Since the last upgrade I've had few problems. Then this morning, I have a new upgrade and the arrow to advance to the next message from within a message is gone. You have to open each one individually, exit, open the next, etc. The programmers must have assumed a swipe would work or something. The constant intrusion of IT 's random diddling has become the largest interference with day-to-day business, leaving power outages and bad weather far behind. Right now Yahoo is playing the village idiot, but any of them could be next.
B0007P0XNC|4.0|This is a magnificent film, and I found the quality normal for its vintage, despite what other reviewers said.  But there are no closed captions in the DVD I received from TeleSales, which I needed for showing to a class.
B00G3Q6VPS|4.0|Seriously...the first track &#34;Alien&#34; was pretty neat, then &#34;Work B**ch&#34; was a grower track that I dig now, then &#34;Perfume&#34; which is a sneaky song courtesy of a genius Sia-written melody...then nothing good...like uhhh, where are the catchy songs??  But after 2 listens (at least)...it starts to work it's sloooooowwwww insinuating magic...but you really have to work your brain with this one...I like that Brit co-wrote ALL the songs here, and the deluxe edition cuts are as good (or better) than the regular 10...BUT this is no &#34;A Million Lights&#34; by Cheryl Cole, clearly the album &#34;Britney Jean&#34; was modelled after...not even close...Will.I.Am's client and production and the EDM model...but I will get into this deeper coming up...<br /><br />To be continued...nice booklet though...
0316010669|3.0|The book started out really good, then it began to drag on and unravel a bit toward the end. &#34;Thin slicing&#34; is a useful power most of us already utilize, and you can hone your skills a bit more by reading this book.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game was almost perfectly balanced as far as difficulty in relation to the interactive game play. I heartily recommend this game for anyone who enjoys hidden object games.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I love the Back to the Future series. When I saw this, I had to have it. It is very nice and fun to build and comes with a &#34;personalized&#34; delorean.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I just got this...but on the first job I needed it on...WOW!!!<br />I had to record the sounds of Harley-Davidson motorcycles starting up.<br />Clear and vivid sounds over a large volume range...just what I needed.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is the best show on tv for sure!  Love it! Great price and shipping. The product came undamaged and I am very happy.  I would order again for sure.  Thank You Amazon!
B009NET0H8|1.0|The book and Vivian Maier photos are wonderful! But the kindle edition is unreadable. I want my money back to buy another copy of the paper edition!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The 2nd season was a little dramatic but I still love the show.  Great price and shipping. The product came undamaged and I am very happy.  I would order again for sure.  Thank You Amazon!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love the Fire and Ice stories.  I have a hard time putting them down. I've read all of the Games of Thrones books and am so looking forward to number six.  These books are very exciting and keep me on the edge of my seat.  The dialogue is superb.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|App won't run...asking Me to login , then says can't connect to sever...how do I contact customer service?. I don't want to uninstall because I will lose progress and I purchased pearls and will lose them and the progress I used them for
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|This is a great book for cat lovers. I enjoyed reading about the cat and his history.  A feel good book.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Intense and bizarre, this story held me to the end! Flynn is a mastermind, I loved every page. Can't wait to read her other books.
B00FB6FOEU|5.0|I was a little nervous on buying this one but after listening to it the first time I was amazed. It sounds like she has another great album of true rock on her hands here
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Enjoyed seeing the reunion of these characters again.  The characters are likable and don't take themselves too seriously.  It was fun to watch - especially if you enjoyed the first one.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|Unclear what people mean by, &#34;does Linda know about ____?&#34; It could say brain surgery and someone would say yes, but you don't know if I watched it on TV or actually perform the surgery. Also, I believe it invades email address books, and sends a request of my behalf, to join linkedin. My mother-in-law had no clue why she was suppose to join.
B00FN811SY|5.0|An excellent research tool. Easy to use, and with the addition of various Bible translations one is under no illusion as to the accuracy of the New World Translation which is now easier to read without losing the integrity of the original scriptures.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Got the package on time, and it is awesome! They were the cheapest option when I was looking to buy this Lego set.
B00BU1DH1M|4.0|Rankin's characters are always engaging and the plots well-developed.  As always, reading the earlier books is a help in unraveling the plots.  Saints is an interesting transition involving Rebus' slow exit and the rise of the others, particularly Malcolm Fox who was his nemesis.  A good read with enough unanswered questions to make me eager to read the next in the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Caution beware this is a highly addictive game!  I was so stoked when I was able to play this on my kindle!!  To keep things short sweet and to the point, this is a must have game if you love puzzles or any kind of a challenge!  The only downside is waiting for your life to restore, but you can have your friends send you lives.  All in all this is a great game.  A+++++++
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|YouTube is one of the best educational tools KNOWN TO MAN :-)...I can't tell you how much I've learned watching various tutorials. I use the Chromecast to watch these videos on my TV
B007549YM4|4.0|A very weird movie especially the way you have to survive to fight for your life but the movie is interesting also there's alway's 1 person that survive last and the rest you no from there
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Did you know that this is the same cord for kindle as well as late model lg and samsung smartphones? It's got a thick durable coating and I don't feel like I have to worry about it shorting out for a long time.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|A truly underdog movie which shows on how everything might seem different or what it may not seem until you give it a try, this movie truly is the best to watch.  Even with sad beginnings and tough parts to it, it never once loses its momentum throughout the movie and is truly a movie worth watching over and over again.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Great concept and characters, suburb use of language and writing technique, beginning and middle are 5 stars....the wrap up wasn't in keeping ...almost like her editor told the author to hurry up and finish it. Too tidy...she could have left the reader with more to conclude for themselves. But giving it 4 stars says I still liked it.
B00ECLU346|1.0|One of the worst movies in the series!  I mean since the series came out I actually enjoyed the first two movies looking forward to the third movie until I got to see it.  I will say that the first 30 minutes the movie fell completely out of line with the rest of the movies, there wasn't anything funny in it really nothing more than disgusting scenes that made me want to send the movie back to get the money back for it.<br /><br />For once this is a Movie series that I can say that I am happy to see stop because if this movie was any indication on where the series would go to after everything then its not worth making any more movies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THANK YOU C&asymp;C&asymp;S HAS FINALLY ARRIVED FOR KINDLE FIRE PLAYERS. I'M LOVIN' IT! AND IT'S SWEET. COULD ADD LIVES A LITTLE FASTER. GREAT GAME
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Good books. Couldn't put them down. Loved the characters and the relationships. Loved the details and the small twists.  Just couldn't handle the ending.....
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a game that is a must for hidden picture lovers. The levels are ever changing and challenging. Love it!
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Hillarious!!! May not be for everyone but my wife and I enjoyed it.  Probably not a movie to watch with the kids.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I love this show! And we have a smart tv so amazon has made it so easy to be able to order it on the tv and watch instantly. No waiting for it to get in.
B006O6F932|3.0|My girls like this school and it did come with a lot of parts and detail but, the stairs do not stay in place and we have had to tape them down otherwise the whole thing doesn't stay upright. I also felt for the price it should have come with at least one doll. Very over priced for what it was.
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|This was probably my LEAST fav of all their books.  It just did NOT live up the usually high standards of a &#34;Pendergast&#34; novel.
B001DPDVE8|5.0|Well made. Really enjoyed have watched several times. Stargate series are all good. Makes you wonder.....? Well defined character's great special effects.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love being able to get onto my facebook on my kindle by one touch!  I use it daily. I stay logged in all the time.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Beautiful film and a classic.  I watch this film every year around Christmas.  I think it is a great reminder that life IS beautiful.  Easy? No. Hard and challenging at times? Yes.  But each of us has the ability to effect the lives of others in small or big ways, and for the greater good. In a &#34;my glass is half empty&#34; society this film is a badly needed viewing.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|My son loves it! It seems to keep him busy, happy, and in tune with the game.  Another free game that I'm thankful for!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Ii think I'm gonna upgrade to a paperwhite soon enough as i do need a device with its own lightning.<br />Navigation is a little difficult and organizing my book collection was pretty tedious.
159463176X|3.0|The emotion found in previous books was really missing from this book. The story had so much potential but in the end just was lacking. I will say I still I had to keep reading to see what happened but took me longer to read then most books. This is a book I could forget unlike the previous.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is awesome I can't put it down . My kids love it, my only problem is getting them off of it so I can play it
1476729085|5.0|Very fun and fast read. There was a lot of humor in this romance book. It was very worth reading and passing on to friends. I am not typically into romance books but this is would highly recommend. I would also recommend if you like this to read The Silver Linings Playbook.
B004NSURT4|2.0|On old story well written but I found the style slow and at times boring.  I have read le Carre books before and liked his style but they were more recent books, so obviously his writing style has changed over the years.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I'm a FreeCell fan, so it was great to add this to my cell phone.  It has great graphics and lots of options.  So far, I've had no problems with it.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|The Rosie project was an excellent read.  How the author portrayed the main character who suffered from Aspergers or a spectrum disorder was very good.  There is a place for everyone in this world and the author showed that no matter what your problem there is someone out there for you.
0385512058|5.0|Definite must read for new business owners or college grads.  I've re-read it twice and it reminds me about going the extra few steps to secure a permanent contact as well as going out on a limb to meet new ones.  Easy read, entertaining and motivating.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|I have trouble relating to Sherlock Holmes.  I don't like the character who I believe is obsessive compulsive and annoying.  For this reason I did not finish the book and am completely over anything to do with Sherlock Holmes.  We are over fed Sherlock Holmes movies, serials etc and I'd like it all to go away.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James, I met your writing and ideas just two days ago, some post on facebook looked appealing enough and I clicked, I was at the office, during office hours with nothing better to do. I loved what I read, but this has happened before, I get excited with some novel idea, some charismatic arrangement of words and like the oxytocin you talk about, it gives me a momentary boost (a mushroom in Mario Kart) and after a few moments I am again on my own, perhaps the same perhaps a little worse...Worse I say because another appealing text has gone by an you have not changed your life (or accepted it, depends on the text you read). Anyway I saw your book in the page i just browsed, an found it on Amazon less than 2 dlls... Less than 2 dollars doesn't trigger (yet) my  stingy cheap neurons and I bought it. But you were right, I would have downloaded it but maybe not read it in the 2 days I did if it were for free.<br /><br />Keep reinventing yourself... I think that is the strongest message I received from your book along with Be true to yourself. I was getting tired of getting nowhere, at least nowhere i wanted to be. I have some say a very good job, but i should be married by now, I should have a house and I should be thinking in having children... But i choose myself and realize good or bad my decisions are mine, and i should keep learning and falling and getting up and being thankful of breathing, of thinking, of this wonderful world.<br /><br />Lastly, i found a perplexing paradox... By choosing yourself, always choosing yourself... You are more capable and more eager to help, to save the day, to be the hero you were born to be... Like choosing yourself is choosing to be free of everything to simply blossom, the no action, the no thought through which everything is done.<br /><br />Thank you man, keep on rocking.<br /><br />Luis
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|this was a great book.  I found the story very relatable and interesting.  It was good to read about different cultures, although at times I thought the author delved into personalities that weren't so directly related to the story line and I found myself wondering what the purpose of this distraction was.
B006TVQTHW|4.0|Great case. Excellent door style side panels. Quiet fans. Only complaint is the weird cover for the tops of the expansion card slots. Everything else about the case is hassle free except this one aspect.
B00005N6KG|2.0|I love how lightweight these headphones are but they don't last long.  After a few months of running with them, one side goes out and the other side flickers.  I have bought several of these headphones since they were only $8 and I would have to throw them away after awhile.  I just went to buy another pair for $8 and now they are $65???  They are totally NOT worth $65!!  I would pay $10 at the most since they are considered &#34;disposable&#34; since they don't last.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|Quite possibly the WORST headset I have ever purchased.<br /><br />Popping is continuous. The sound cuts out constantly. I've owned this for a year now and I can definitively say: It's a piece of s***.<br /><br />If I could get my money back, I would. Do not buy this under any circumstances.
B00FGFVMGA|3.0|Great fun  game,  but makes you really think a little...easy to play and is very suitable for the kindle fire.
B00DERIV8Y|3.0|This figure looks amazing, but I had serious trouble getting the Crossbow into his hands. I still haven't figured out how to remove the head to put the poncho on, so Daryl is currently sporting the angel wing biker vest instead of the Poncho...not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />To get the Crossbow in hand I had to spend a good bit of time flexing the fingers and thumb away from each other slowly, much further than you would think you'd need to. Be very careful with this. I feel like these could tear pretty easily.<br /><br />I do recommend the figure. As I said, it's looks great. I just wish I didn't feel like I was going to ruin it during every minute of assembly.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This is one of those movies that is fun everytime you watch it. The kind you want to watch over and over.
B00138J2MA|5.0|Great being able to buy old music via MP3, and the price was excellent.  Love the cloud player options for downloading purchased music to phone or computer.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I never knew that Elizabeth Gilbert was capable of such brilliant work. I couldn't put this book down. The research she did and the story she wove was amazing.  This is the best book I have read this year. If you enjoy historical fiction you will love it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved it. A wonderful story. I really expected a different ending but it was a great read. I recommend this book. I would like to read others by this author.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I purchased it and found it user friendly.You can give it a shot.No glitches whatsoever.plus there is a option of converting it to pdf which i think is pretty handy
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good story.  John Grisham's books are always a good reads. Some of the same characters as in A Time to Kill but the story is different.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I love this app, it is easy to use, the different translations are awesome in getting different meaning of the Scriptures
B00GX59QO2|5.0|This movie was plain and simple fun and exciting.  Great action! Funny!  The cast is fantastic!  I'll buy this one!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is awesome and has kept me stimulated, yet chillaxed for months. If you want a new spin on the Flow concept and hundreds of challenging levels - check out Parking Puzzle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series is a must read!!  Excellent books that are well written and you do not want to put them down. The movies are good but the books are even better.
0224087444|5.0|This book is so fascinating that I finished it in two days.  Before reading the book, being a Chinese brought up in Hong Kong soon after the Japanese surrender, I am already familiar with the history of that period, and the many &#34;unfair&#34; treaties China suffered from Japan and the western nations during the end of the 19th century.  I have learnt to feel disgusted at the lootings during the invasion of Beijing by the armis of eight different countries.  All past history books have incriminated Cixi for the shame of the tragedies.  This book provides a brief review of the history of that period, and a more personal description of Cixi and the people who headed the tragedies.  By first setting up Cixi as a heroine, the books appears to be biased.  At the end, it is up to the readers to do their own research to decide their own feelings.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series is a must read!!  Excellent books that are well written and you do not want to put them down. The movies are good but the books are even better.
B00GQ7OZR0|4.0|I realize the &#34;Dexter&#34; seasons have been uneven, but the last season is good enough.  The ensemble cast still delivers strong performances, and the writing is uniformly good.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|saw the movie at the theaters in imax. got here quick. wasent as good as the big screen but still love the movie.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|I really enjoyed this book & it was hard for me to put down at night!<br />I definitely recommend it.
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|Would give it a higher rating but for all the crap you have to buy with cash other than that it is a good game
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The construction of how this ends must have been difficult to write. I really didn't like the children deaths.  I understand that it fit with the rest of the story.  But I would have preferred another basis for completion.  All in all this series was a great read
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome and all, but Mojang really needs to stop focusing on the computer version of minecraft and focus more on Xbox One Edition and Pocket Edition! I mean seriously, Xbox 360 edition has been updating for years and it just reached 1.3, wow Mojang, just wow. They haven't even started PS4 edition yet!!! Minecraft is an awesome game but Mojang has to stay on top of their work to keep the #1 Indie game going.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This series was incredibly well done. Great characters, excellent plot development, and scenery that adds to the overall feel of the movie. You feel as though you really get to know the characters, but not in a way that betrays the plot!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's an interesting game a little addictive but short, I hope they make more levels, isn't that hard but it make you think
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|Great resource for anyone starting to work from home, or considering to hire a remote employee.  With such a boom in remote workers, this resource has very broad applications. It's an easy read with tremendous real-life examples.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I got the album in great form and all the benefits of purchasing it ahead of most people, like the Plant A Prism thing. Also, the album itself is very good. I love all of the songs on here and I like how different it is from Katy's previous album, yet it has just enough spunk to still seem like her.
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|I love this CD...it is beautiful.  I was pleasantly surprised. The original is before my time,  I have heard many Everly Brothers songs, but not these, til now....
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is very fun to pass time why u wait in a doc office or what have you. It always normal has new cars or what they think would be cool to drive I think they should make a airplane version of this game
B00992CF6W|5.0|Cool it's has cool stuff but I always die free wood I will do it so cool this time<br /><br />$
B003I87O2I|5.0|This is the first cd with new singer Kelly Hansen. My favorite songs are 1 Can,t Slow Down 2 In Pieces 3 When It Comes To Love 4 Living In A Dream 5 Give me a Sign 6 Too Late 7 Lonely 8 Angel Tonight . This is strong cd for new singer Kelly Hansen. Crank this one up it rocks.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|A roaring good time of entertainment.  The chemistry between all the actors was fantastic. Action scenes unbelievable and hysterical.  Great viewing
B0090RSYVG|5.0|Almost too adorable for words.  He looks exactly like the Lego Minifigure except his helmet is fixed to his head so you can't lose him.  I love taking Loki everywhere.  He's a great conversation starter and is just so, so cute.  His little frowny face is priceless.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This is one of those CDs that just makes me feel good. There is a subtle beauty to the music that sweeps me up and carries me along. The vocals are captivating and blend perfectly. I love every song and can play this CD over and over without tiring of it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book provides an interesting and reasonably convincing theory of what sort of person the historical Jesus might have been, given the political and religious trends of his time.  Those with an interest in recent Biblical scholarship are not likely to be astonished by any of Aslan's hypotheses, but he does bring together various strands into a believable case.  Those who are offended by discussion of Jesus as a man will be offended, and those who are offended by anything that a Muslim says will be even more offended.  Too bad for them: it is an interesting read, particularly if you consider what happened to the idea of Jesus in the centuries that followed.
B000GOU4M4|5.0|Classic Chevy brings his best in the prime of his career. We can all relate to several parts of this film.
B00A8FXT8M|5.0|Beautiful, quiet, lovingly written.  It is so real that it brings tears to my eyes, a &#34;small life&#34; of a good man.
B0043UB0EI|2.0|The CGI is poorly executed and the dialogue is tiresome and predictable.  The backdrops look like they were constructed by a bunch of high school kids and the characters are simply flat.  Not recommended.
B003ZDO90G|1.0|If you want to experience how a middle class person sees poverty, this is your book, but it is not mine.  She carries her values, her perceptions, her judgements to the writing table and into the narrative.  Give me An author who enters the souls of the poor.
1451695195|5.0|This is a super book.  I have recommended it to numerous friends and my children.  His presentation could have been a little better in places, but overall a wonderful and inspirational read.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Excellent movie. It keep me very interested from beginning to end. I loved the story telling, so I would not get lost.
B008JFUNYG|2.0|If you're a fan of the earlier version of this movie, my advise is to not waste your time in buying this remake. Beyond the gore and blood spilling, the storyline pales in comparison to the original movie. As many have mentioned in their reviews, you'll be disappointed if you're expecting the same level of excitement as when you first watch the original.
B008602KQI|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing young actress.  Whatever her role, her face<br />speaks volumes.  She carries this film beautifully, but other actors give strong<br />performances as well.  The cinematography is amazing.  Highly recommend.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This item is a Christmas present for my son, I receive the item in a timely manner but it has not been watched yet as explained
B00G4NUQYM|4.0|Using single letters as portions of the clues is pretty slick. This game is not for folks who think it will be a walk in the park!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I could not put the book down especially the last few chapters of the book.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It doesn't have much more than a basic 4-function calculator, but for a free product it looks and works great.  With the history feature, you can look back at previous calculations, which is helpful if you want to remember a number part way through your arithmetic without re-crunching the first half of the numbers.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|It's like Iron Man 2 plus Iron Man 1.  Both of those are awesome.  So I guess that makes this one doubly awesome.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Minion rush is fun but when it comes to earning things it frustrating like those gru coins. So I give it a four
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is awesome, especially now that it supports HBO Go.  Just be sure you have an extra outlet or a USB device to plug it in.  Google is hella shady in their marketing and doesn't show the GIANT CABLE sticking out of the back.  Thankfully the product works really well.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Diffuse plotline lacking any real human interest. It was large on destruction (wasn't Superman here to protect humanity, not recklessly tear down?), lacking any of the humanity and delightful innocence of Superman.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Works as advertised, arrived quickly and was well packaged.<br /><br />The only reason I mark it 4 stars is because the physical connection is too weak. I feel the magnets could be more powerful so it stays connected. It seems as though the slightest movement will knock the charger off of the Nexus 10. As long as you leave it and aren't trying to actually your Nexus at the same time it's charging, it's just fine.<br /><br />Overall, pretty happy with my purchase. Would buy again
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show really does live up to the accolades, I haven't read the books but the fact that the writer is closely involved with the series and script adaption is obviously part of the reason the show is so well structured and produced. I am not usually a fan of these type of fantasy shows but what sets Game of Thrones apart is the great characters who are created to be more real, dimensional and human even though the mystical and unexplained happens they are regular humans for the most part dealing with extreme situations.<br /><br />Also the production and set design is incredible shooting on location in regions that evoke the performance also adds another layer something I like to see in an age where green screen performance can be a little obvious regardless of how good the actor is, there is something to be said for making the set so authentic that it inspires the performance.<br /><br />There are plenty of great reviews in depth here on Amazon, so all I want to say is from someone who usually finds fantasy a bore, that this has kept me wanting more at every episode!
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|this author has a way of going behind the obvious, and rethinking our assumptions in a clear and provocative way.
B006GLLREU|5.0|The entire series is in my opinion the best series HBO has ever done. I saw the Sopranos was given this accolade recently but I totally disagree. Here are my reasons. Six Feet Under has deep rich and profound characters who you really care about and have everyday life crises to deal with that we can all relate to. How many people are mobsters??<br /><br />Second there are strong rich female characters in this series that drive the drama and they get a good amount of screen time, not the less than 17% that Geena Davis's research institute has proven for women and girls across the board for the majority of media including feature film, TV series and animation. Isn't a little over 50% of the world population women and girls -so why do we accept depictions of males as more interesting? Writers, directors and producers need to do better and be more creative with their characters, this show shows that it is possible to have great female characters as rich and entertaining as any of their male counterparts, and they do not have to kill or be murdered by a mobster to achieve that.<br /><br />Thirdly we are all going to die and this show profoundly explores that reality in every episode touching on all classes, situations, ages, race and gender. It is not just about knocking people off or gratuitous violence even though some of these deaths do occur violently. Six Feet Under explores death and grieving as well as the difficult aspects of burying a loved one again a complex and human way that we can all relate to.<br /><br />I enjoyed every season of this series and final episode is by far one of the best HBO written/produced episodes of any series they have ever done. Kudos to Alan Ball he knows how to write for all types of characters including great gay characters and real believable relationships too, David and Keith are one of the best male couples depicted in a main stream series, and Claire's dabble with sexuality was also completely believable and well written.  I amsure all the people involved in this series must feel honored to be part of such a great work, in my mind it goes down as the best!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I truly enjoyed this series.  It's fun, the best type of adventures--exploring the great unknown with a great cast. You can't go wrong!
B004GGQMTW|5.0|A break out film -and one where women are actually the main action heroes. Both actors are perfect in their roles it is entertaining and powerful cinema.
B00009AOBI|4.0|Wife really enjoyed the film. It is a good movie to add you your collection if you are a Cher fan.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|This processor Working Very faster, and have good performance on rendering with Sony Vegas, After Effects and Cinema 4D.<br /><br />I Recomended 100% For Everyone.<br />(More Core, More Speed, Less Money)
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Excellent show with good writing. The characters are complex. It is fun to watch and see where the story line is going.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Great movie for Superman finally.  If you are a Superman fan watch this.  Or just buy it for your collection.
030758836X|5.0|Amazing! That's all that needs to be said. Read it to see why. You won't regret it. Really, Truly. True.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Except one small thing, a believable story which make movies like this enjoyable.  I've been wanting to see it, but FIOS won't rent it and they want more than the DVD costs to buy it.  Watched using Amazon Prime on my laptop.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Lacks the intensity and suspense of the first two. Waited anxiously for this book...wish I had never read it. Horrible wrap up of what had been a great series. Was looking forward to the movie but will probably skip it now.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|The graphics are great and the hints get you through the game. If you really get stuck there's the solution right there so it's a good<br /> game for all levels of players.
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|Heard about it on some site picked it up and couldn't stop reading it, great art and story! This is a comic worth reading
B000URWYTS|3.0|It was a very interesting book about the love of Frank Loyd Wright and his mistress and the problems they encountered in days when living together was unheard of and the persecution they encountered.  It was a book you could put down and hold off getting back to it.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|The story is full of twists and turns you will never expect.  I love to see how the characters develop.  If this is your first Preston/Child book I doubt it will be your last.
1451683405|1.0|From a pragmatic point of view, this latest resurgence of the 'free will' debate is pointless. It's tabula rasa all over again. Old hat. It sounds rather like the argument against faith to me: Pretending to know things you cannot know.<br />There's irony in them there Harris hills.
B007X6SMD6|1.0|Hardly helpful for non IT types.  Apparently the services can be provided at nominal cost but getting to a functional setup requires knowledge and assistance that can only be obtained at significant cost and ongoing support fee commitment.  Nice revenue model...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this guy can read ,my entire family cant stop talking about how well this guy can read even the kids enjoy listening to the way he reads actually I am using the way he reads to encouraging my son to practice his reading .love it
0385537131|4.0|Good read about the lawyer from &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;, that deals with the remnants of racism in the south, the horrors of many egotistical,selfserving lawyers who like many companies think we are all stupid and easily munipulated. Not a very flattering view of many lawyers but the main character is honest and noble and the ending satisfying. Not the best book i ever read but i finished it!
B00C32U3VY|5.0|Outside of Star Wars, this has to be John Williams best work.  Everything he does is great, but this one in my opinion is the best.  Everytime I hear the main theme, it puts in the mood to watch the movie (which I have seen dozens of times).  The soundtrack never gets old.  I can't believe it has been 20 years since the movie/soundtrack was released.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love it! This book is back to the good old scare your pants of Stephen King! Those who loved the Shining won't be disappointed.
B001MSMULG|3.0|I didn't appreciate the rather coarse/bad language that seemed to run throughout the book.  I haven't found that in the other Silva books I have read (maybe an occasional bad word, but not consistent throughout the books).
B002LAM7PI|5.0|Bizarre. Wonderful. Gutsy story. There are so many parts of this that I'd love to show my five year old but it's pretty scary overall. Different scary true. Can't wait till my son is old enough to watch it!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Great graphics. I like the missions. But would love if you could get help from other players that aren't connected to Facebook. I don't like adding people to my Facebook just to get further in my games. Especially if I don't know the people I'm adding.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Beautifully researched, beautifully written. Gilbert combines deep knowledge of her subject . . with a complex, yet achingly real, emotional component. Most of us will recognize elements of Alma in ourselves.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love the game!The music is soothing and the game itself makes you think to get the answer .....the best kind of game !
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's latest book is as good as his others.  His insights into people, life and situations are  always illuminating.  As a retired teacher I can tell you that his insight into class size is right on!
B002PZ6XB8|5.0|Such a sweet  and captivating movie for any Anglophile.  Well done.  Once again showing us the restrictions put on grown women during the Edwardian era.  Miss Potter is Beatrix Potter the author of Peter Rabbit books.  Charming the way they come to life from her drawings.  Rene Zellweger was perfect.  .
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  I love this cast.  It's so hilarious and action packed.  I would recommend this movie to any lover of movies of this kind.  Great find.
B000FC10IO|5.0|I read this series a couple years ago. And read it now again . It written in a way that you can't stop reading it until you are done. It never gets boring and keeps you bound!
B005LAIHPE|1.0|Just pass on this one. Conversion of this game to a movie left anything good behind in the concept phase. Predictable, ridiculous. Effects are kind of cool but I prefer my special effects hung on a story of some kind. This is a stinker.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I felt that the book was way too drawn out. The way some conflicts were resolved were just too simple. A lot of the time I felt that events were being told instead of shown to me. Towards the end I started skimming just to get it over with. A disappointment :-/
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite novels.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys literature, and I found it to be one of the few pieces I've read that accurately captures nearly every aspect of a man's life.  Gregory David Roberts draws from a vast pool of experience, which translates so well to the story.  Go read this right now.
B00DSO9RMC|5.0|Another good story with colourful characters and lots of laughs from Terry. He just keeps rolling out the fun reads
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of the funniest family Christmas movies you will ever seen! This is one of those movies you will watch every year during the Holidays!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|enjoy playing to relax, good graphics, sound, etc. would refer game app to family and friends. Play on my desktop as well.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|It's entertaining, it doesn't glitch or bug out nearly as much as the other games I've tried, the energy charge thing gets a little annoying after a while, but hey...regardless, it's a fun game
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Another winner from Preston & Child.  Plot vaguely similar in places of one of the plots of an earlier Pendergast novel, though.  Once I got over the occasional sense of deja-vu, I enjoyed White Fire immensely.  Fine writing as always, and plenty of plot twists and surprises.  Eagerly looking forward to their next release!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The book was so compelling I had to force myself to put it down as I did not want the story to end. Grisham is a great story teller. This is an accurate depiction of the culture of the South during that period, I witnessed some of those inequities first hand. It was both sad and scary as these people were less than human. The author puts it in perspective, and shows the progress being made in the present culture through the cast of characters and the jury. He also shows the \\"hangover\\" we endure. Very engrossing.<br />As with other world events which have been hard to believe, these things did happen and take long periods of time to overcome. We must learn from them and move on. The victim must play a role in rising from the ashes, not wallowing in the memory. Education and hope are key. A weaning from the entitlements which have unintentionally bogged down the process must continue to evolve through the survivors on all sides of the issue.

B00FPGSPQU|5.0|Funny with a little twist.  I love the whole series of movies!  If you have seen the first two, then this one is a must.  VERY FUNNY!
B000K3M1VI|5.0|one of the most riveting performances by an actress I have ever seen. Streep was well deserving of the Academy award she won<br />Although the movie tended to drag the first 40 mins, (it is 2 and 1/2 hours long), it became very intense and emotionally riveting, with the revelations that Sophie (Streep) made. Your initial reaction towards her changed 180 degrees by the time the film ended - along with a box of Kleenex.<br />One hell of a story line, as opposed to todays films which tend to focus on special effects, glitch, and glamour, rather then anything of substance.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|Oh my goodness! The best movie ever! What an awesome love story that had me from the beginning! I loves Zach Efron! Oh my! You'll want to watch this movie over and over!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|It was slow to get started but once it got going it totally drew me into the story. I will definately read the rest of the series.
B0042UEU8M|5.0|Great movie! I wasn't sure I would like this movie, but I loved it! It kept you on your toes to see what would happen next to Charlie!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I could not put this book down!! I love that they brought the troubled teen back. This was classic Pendergast! The only bad part for me was that the book wasn't longer. But then again, if it had been, I don't think I could have taken the suspense. Super read. Can't wait for the next one.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Awesome movie - watched it like a dozen times.  It's one of those movies that should be bought as it's truly epic filmmaking in every sense of the word.
B00GTZJLAK|3.0|it's just like Cars, but it's planes.  Not as good as Cars, but the kids enjoyed it and ended up watching it twice over the weekend.
B00957T6X6|5.0|The series is real yet fantasy that keeps you reading page after page...I am on book four now and still loving it!  The characters are so round and believable and the story just as intricate as you would like.  A great read, especially since each book is so long, worth every penny!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|This should have been a short story.  It just went on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love all the Sookie Stackhouse novels, but definitely for mature readers as it usually contains explicit sexual content.  The reader comes to be vested in the main Character Sookie Stackhouse and her perilous life in Bon Temps Lousiana with vampires, werewolves and even fairies which she happens to be part!  Sad to see the series coming to a close.  so much better than the tv series.

B0031RSBU0|1.0|So over the course of two weeks I went from having never read a Mankell book, to having read four. This was purely because I needed something to read on an overseas trip, so I downloaded all four at once.<br /><br />To get straight to the point, I found the constant reiteration of the protagonist's racism towards refugees extremely alienating, at first I thought that it would prove to be a view that would be challenged in the course of the first book, and be a device to show character development. However to my dismay Wallander continued to spout racist views about the undesirability and criminality of refugees throughout all four books, as if it were some sort of unfortunate intentional theme.<br /><br />I admini

0823023494|5.0|This is a fantastic book. Tom Bancroft is truly a master of his craft and he presents the information in a friendly and un-intimidating way. What I truly love about Bancroft though, is his style. He captures the magic that made me fall in love with animation and cartooning in the first place.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Good game I liked it so much that I could not stop playing it for about 6 to 8 hours
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Anthony Bordain is one of my favorite all around interestin people.  He is an excellent writer, chef, humanitarian and has a wicked sense of humor.  I believe this might have been his very first book published and since the has come a very long way. I also enjoy his new travel program on CNN and would like to say he has done more for world understanding and U.S. relations than all the U.S. Ambassadors have curranty done.  Well done Mr. Bordain.  Also, did I mention he is a great chef - yum.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS game is much fun. I like you have think about your moves makes your brain think. I wouldget it if you can.

B00499NHLC|5.0|Sherlock is an amazing television series with a talented cast, intelligent writers, and superb direction. The first episode had me hooked before the opening song even started. Because of Sherlock, I have become an avid Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman fan. I am even thinking of starting Doctor Who because I so enjoy Steven Moffat's writing. If you want something smart, funny, and thrilling to watch, pick Sherlock!

B00BAXFCPO|2.0|Poorly written and researched. Apparently the author bases his hypotheses on his patients, not normal people. Surprising, there are many errors, more than I could put up with, so I stopped reading it half way through and don't intend to go back. Since I have dementia in my family, I looked for clues that might help me understand my situation. The book is mostly speculation, and as a true scientist, the author should have pointed out that his theories are just that, not facts as he implies. I would not recommend this book written by an arrogant author.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Enjoy this . I take alot of pictures now then before when I first got my kindle, makes it lot's of fun and easy to use.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|Very interesting and timely concept, just not well written. It felt heavy-handed and obvious. Read 1984 for a better dystopian story.

B00FVZJYK6|5.0|Usually the sequel isn't as good as the original.......definitely NOT in this case!  The Minions are fantastic! Steve Carell's Gru is a superhero!
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Very psychological read. I wasn't sure that there wasn't an opening chapter missing when I started reading. I normally love Cornwell's books but this one as similar to the last one, was too much detail in the beginning and a rush to the end.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|First, I want to say that this will be a hard movie to watch if you had a loved one that died on Alaska Airlines Flight 261.  My good friend's mom died on that flight so it was sad to watch. Except for the things going on with the pilot, the crash happened the same way.<br /><br />As for the movie, it was a little too long.  Denzel Washington's character was predictive and the movie got boring because of that.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Worth watching over and over.  There's just so much to like about this series.  Owning the DVD gets you through the long wait for the next season of new episodes.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|Disappointing. I'm a lifelong NIN fan and this album seems lazy. Like it was produced simply to put out a record. There is nothing of substance here. I'd prefer a band wait until they have the time and inspiration to produce new music before putting a record out. He's been focused on How To Destroy Angels and movie soundtrack composition. I'm hoping for a more engaging and biting record the next time around.

B004IALZUW|5.0|I must have missed it when this movie first came out. Very cute, cartoony take on the classic Dick Tracy. Warren does a great job, and the plot is one that will keep you guessing.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|A very nice background sound player - many choices including white, brown noises, nature sounds, several water noises. I like that you can combine noises. I work in a newborn nursery at night - trust me - THIS works to soothe crying babies!

B00B2V66VS|3.0|I really got it for my grandson to play & he is pretty good at it. The game was free so no lose there. Reminds me of an old game called dragon layer ( I think) one wrong move & you die. lol
B008CP6RWU|5.0|An amazing experience. Bought just for Journey and really that justifies the purchase. The only con was that it didn't last long enough.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Very fun & challenging. The higher up the boards the more of a challenge. Sometimes I go back just to make 3 stars on every board. Just hate it when I run out of lives. But what more do you want for a free game plus if you keep wining you keep playing. Addictive. Highly recommend.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|So fun to play, addictive.  I have waited until it was free for my Kindle and I am glad I waited.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I'm not happy with the way the book ended... I bawled like a baby! I want more with Tris and Four.. :(
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|The best waterproof MP3 player out there. Much better than any other similar product, as the technology they use is totally different, and the sound quality (under water) is phenomenal. Great job done by the designers!
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|Great movie. I love animated movies. The 3D is very well done. The story and humor were great. Great family movie, and follows up Monsters Inc. perfectly.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|I googled Christian romance and got this book.  The story line was good, but the graphic sex scenes had to be skipped throughout the book.  I would have just put it down, but I did like the story.  I can do without the &#34;porn&#34; in the details.  I would not read any more novels as I do not need to read those kinds of things to understand a good love story.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|love it and mom will be to when she unwraps hers under the tree. Thank you so much. Skye Jackson,
031623480X|5.0|This book is definitely an eye-opener because it explains in very simple language--and based on scientific studies-- why wheat, carbs and sugar are contributing to neurological diseases.  Thanks to Dr. Perlmutter's book, I now know what types of food I should be eating and those I should avoid.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book is verry well written. All the claims have research and studies to back them up. If you think this is all just a push for a new dietary trend, read and prepare to be shocked as the author breaks down the so called \\"science\\" on cholestlerol and fat. The medical establishment has proven itself to be nothing more than a peddler for pharmaceuticals that often times offer little to NO benefit while burdening patients with side effects that create worse problems than the one it was meant to treat!<br /> The so called studies that support cholesterol lowering statins have been cherry picked to look as if they are beneficial. And we all believed it. Enough is enough! This book puts big pharma and junk science on trial and breaks it all down so anyone can understand it. Those who continue to push statins and a low fat diet should be convicted. The evidence is damning, unbelievably abundant and shocking.<br />If you ever wondered why obesity and type 2 diabetes are so prevalent even as the government continues to recommend cutting fat and consuming whole grains- here is your answer. I tried to see if I could refute ANY of the information presented in this book and sadly, I couldn't. This is information we all need to know!<br />One additional interesting bit of information- Sweden just came out with new dietary guidelines for its entire country. Guess what it is? It is LOW CARB and fat is just fine! They don't seem to be beholden to the grain farmers like we are here and actually recommended something that puts the health of their entire nation before any special interest groups.

But as a long standing tradition, we went to see the holiday film of the year before Christmas...and we saw this when it came out.  Laughed hard the whole way through.  Now it's a yearly tradition to watch this before Christmas (maybe more than once).  The deluxe version is worth it too, I have both.  This movie is INCREDIBLY quotable, and I find myself quoting it all year long.  &#34;was anyone emotionally shattered?&#34;  &#34;BLEEDING HEARTS OF THE WORLD UNITE&#34; &#34;Look at that hack job&#34; &#34;RUNNNN BEFORE I...KKIILLLL AGAIN&#34; &#34;I want a pony so I can ride it twice get bored and sell it to make glue&#34; &#34;This is NOT pudding&#34; etc.<br /><br />It's bound to be a classic, as the original was.

I guess if you like entrails and mucus, this is the book for you.

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Sanderson introduces us to a fascinating array of characters beginning with David our protagonist. David has spent his youth gathering information on the Epics, taking careful notes and plotting his revenge against Steelheart. Steelheart is the epic who forever changed David’s life and who rules the city with fear and tyranny. David is bright, and fearless, but he is also a young and I found him endearing. His actions, conversations and metaphors, will have you giggling. He has feelings for a kick-ass Reckoner, and it was adorable, awkward and made my heart flip. I really connected with him, and loved the nickname the Reckoners gave him. The Reckoners themselves are a diverse group of individuals, and each brings a dynamic skill and mind-set to this motley team. The Epics while not fleshed out, were terrifying and unique. Their abilities sprang to life as Sanderson introduced each one. Each has a unique set of abilities from illusions to fire, but all have a weakness much like the Superheroes we all know and love. Sanderson brought the Epics and Reckoners to life keeping me completely captivated.<br /><br />Steelheart was action-packed, with twists and turns that even I didn’t see coming. Sanderson provided a panoramic view of the city, and its residences . The world building was wonderfully done, without a lot of info dumps, and while I still have oodles of questions I felt confident as I read. One of the things I enjoy when reading a book in this genre is when an author makes the impossible seem probable , and I so believed from the Epics to the kick-ass Reckoners. The super abilities to the amazing gadgets the Reckoners possessed made me drool. Sanderson has a wicked imagination, and I thoroughly enjoyed the benefits. It’s a simple tale of good verse evil, man overcoming oppression and adversity. How can one not fall in love with the underdogs and root them to victory? The twists and reveals blew me away, and made me freakishly giddy as subtle clues suddenly clicked into place, and I yelled, “OMG, of course!” This was hands down one of the most intense and fascinating reads I have read this year. It’s one of those books you cannot set down, where you travel so deeply into the tale and its characters that the outside world disappears. I imagined myself sitting at the window of a war torn and abandon high tower building high above the city as I watched this tale unfold. Copy was provided by publisher in exchange for unbiased review, full review originally published at caffeinated book reviewer.y clicked into place, and I yelled, “OMG, of course!” This was hands down one of the most intense and fascinating reads I have read this year.

B00004XQ8E|3.0|12-03-2013.  Bruno Walter met composer. Moeller 1901 this recording is of the symphonies numbers one in D major by Moeller and his second symphony see minor Resurrection written between 1888 and 1894 the Columbia Symphony Orchestra is conducted by Bruno Walter The total recording time for the first symphony is 51 minutes and 20 and 57 seconds the symphony number two last approximately 79 1/2 minutes The Columbia Symphony Orchestra was formed by Columbia records of New York specifically for Bruno vaulter to make LPs with the only other example of such an arrangement was with Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra for mostly RCA Victor recordings There are a few examples in classical music history where young conductor becomes a prodigy of a composer and then later records his music was such a authoritative ability we recall the famous recording bite we can Yoakem with the Berlin Philharmonic of Carl or scar me Tiburon up with the composer personally supervising the recording sessions for Dr. gramophone Such projects as these are vital to classical music understanding of exactly what the composer intended and we have precious few of them but here Columbia records has presented them both on compact disc in surprisingly good sound in a two disc set at a discount price Assisting maestro vulture in the performance of the second symphony is American soprano Emelia Cundari and the American control told Maureen Forrester along with the choir of Westminster College in New York and the Columbia Symphony Orchestra The Titans Symphony number one teenager by Mohler has four movements the first movement is Mark Longson and last 13 minutes and 19 seconds Though it is marked to be played slow it has several Tempe a quick rousing useful refreshing melody dominates this first movement with beautiful flute birdcalls around 5 to 6 minute marks there is a Big Horn climax which appears between 807 and 824 and then we go on to a suspenseful climax between 1123 and 1139 After this there is a triumphant clothes and it's very nice Bruno vaulters temples as he grew older also got a little slower but he was never a quickstep conductor and I recall always liking Bruno Walter because he had a long graceful treatment for music which allowed all little nuances and little touches in the notes to be fully exposed as if they were individual singing voices he allowed everyone to properly pronunciation all of their bowels and consonant Perhaps one of the most important things about this moment free symphony is this there are a few composers who created a first symphony of such exquisite magnitude as the mall or first perhaps Sibelius could be a competitor and one also thinks of Tchaikovsky's winter dreams a very beautiful symphony<br />  To be perfectly honest the best first symphony is out of Johannes Brahms which Brahms wrote and premiered when he was approximately 42 to 43 years of age it was preceded however by the greatest requiem ever written find Duchess Requiem in 1865 I don't know if Braums ever heard the Moller first but I'd be very interested in knowing what his impressions were he must've been impressed quite a bit it is a magnificent and glorious The second movement is Marcroft take the effect it lasts approximately five minutes and 32 seconds it is full of rich and lusty tunes in its opening with great little strings that are crisp and clean wonderful 19 sixtyish sound on this recording and the muted distant trumpet sounds have always been wonderful with Moeller and here they are it's crisp and clear as I've ever heard them Moeller go board in Bohemia which is now the Czech Republic had a truelove for the Austrian Lendler dance which is a lilting kind of flowing music sort of like a walls Austrian style but with a true peasant country flavor approximately at two minute mark Bruno Walter slows the orchestra down and quieted down for approximately a minute and a quarter and then brings it back up in perfectly natural pacing There is a wonderful Mollo Moller trio at the three-minute section that lasts about a minute and the rest of the music is sunny warm and joyous as this mood prevails throughout the rest of the short movement brilliant scoring by the composer returns this piece to the principal theme at about 532 Mark with a bit more gusto and then onto the finish of the movement<br /><br />symphony and it seems that Moller still in his late 20s pushing 30 had already worked out his fundamental symphonic language and was well on his way to a successful symphonic writing<br />  Movement number three of the symphony is the famous for Shaka movement where the idea of this French nursery rhyme is prevalent throughout the movement and one can hear the tapping of the timpani's skins with a good set of headphones which is what I used to vaulter is at his best or near best in these passages with the wonderful Klitchman music running at about 2 1/2 to 320 minute mark wonderful Jewish imprint of the music it ends quietly unplucked lower strings<br /><br />  By the time the fourth movement arrives we have been hearing music approximately for 31 minutes most of it rather came joyous and upbeat but now all heck breaks loose as we entered the movement called stir miss you the exact stormy and moving if you have ever been caught out in the open in the Dakotas for Montana Wyoming or possibly Utah and they summers windstorm and thunderstorm this music will be very familiar to you thunder lightning and torrential rains in a musical context give us almost a big sky movement Molly said of this movement that it was the sound of a dreadfully wounded heart the feelings are quite apparent here as he tells us exactly how he feels Throughout this movement and in Deep Throat the entire first symphony the clarity by vaulter and the orchestra are five star rating the playing is simply wonderful and Grunewald rises and falls with great drama for 1960 or earlier this is a splendid recording the sound and virtuosity are very very impressive Heartily recommended at a 4 1/2 star rating for the symphony number one and after tea break will look at number two<br /><br />  The Mahler symphony number two and see minor the Resurrection written between 1888 in 1894 was one of the very first LPs that I bought in my life I purchased it around 1970 from us from a department store in the south southeast side Chicago suburb in Indiana I remember that it was a recording by the Philadelphia Orchestra Eugene Normandy on RCA and the album cover spoke about the void of eternities the apocalypse of something or another that got my imagination As we know Moller struggled with the writing of the second symphony he tried to avoid the mistakes and shortcomings of his first symphony which as we know now now know is quite the masterpiece Howard Moller was very self-critical he could not figure out how to bring this monumental something to a close until he attended the funeral of a man whom he liked and admired greatly the greatest conductor in Europe at the time Hans von Bulow in 1893 As Bulow was being laid to rest in the cemetery there was a small choir singing Friedrich clop stocks owed of resurrection offer stating yeah I'll first game arise guess you shall arise again The composer work this into a work which was published separately called the total fear or the funeral rites sometimes it is substituted as the first movement of the symphony but it also exists as its own separate composition the similarities with this and the actual first movement of the symphony on which it is based are striking The first movement is 21 minutes and 35 seconds long it is Mark allegro mise Dossow bomb takes a very majestic temple to this music stressing the dynamic range only enough so that it is not exaggerated it is logical it is tragic it is sad and it is mournful but they're also very warm and beautiful glimpses of peace the memory of you It has become customary for conductors after the first movement is finished to standdown offof the podium for about five minutes just to take a breather perhaps at water as he Worcaster and the course remains onstage along with the soloists after which we return to the second third and fourth movements which are also see collectively as an intermezzo in three parts Once again Moeller in the second movement the andante moderato of 10 minutes and 35 seconds turns to his favorite Lendler temples Falter elicits a wonderful beautiful Stringtown from the Columbia Symphony Orchestra musicians and a gentle plucked accompaniment by this orchestra the attacks are not too harsh but there still dramatic with a good sense of overall feel and not metal mutes used in the trumpets that Mollerus so famous for in this recording are sharp and clear and clean There is a lack of a sense of urgency in this movement as it should be it is seen somewhat as a recovery from the stormy and taxing first movement is very leisurely paced and quite refreshing vaulters conducting is very precise<br /><br />  Once again we hear Kletzville music that we heard in the second movement to the symphony the clarinet perform exquisitely I give them five stars and the dynamic range is believable and very well-balanced it is not exaggerated the noisy finale goes right on target with the orchestra as a swell to a fortissimo and then and the movement<br />  The fourth moving to the symphony Mahler entitled Ehrlich which is primal like it is again another Vanderhorn song is to be some very slow with a sense of longing but it is to be sung simply my wife and I had the pleasure of hearing this wonderful symphony performed by Spokane Symphony orchestra here in northeast Washington I do not recall the name of the soloist but she sang the song is if she owned it Performing here is a Columbia records Stellers*voice control to Maureen Forrester her phrasing is exquisite and alone I would say I would give her a five star rating The most poignant line in the Bundoran text of Ehrlich is this I came from God and I will return to God up to eternal life once the Ehrlich song has been sung by Forrester there's a brief pause before the final movement and we know that there will be a great outburst by the orchestra this is the movement of the resurrection where the course will come in later at the end there is a great explosion in the orchestra that dies down to several trumpet Anhorn calls from backs After the initial fortissimo in the stage is set we hear from the backstage and English horn call with tremolo strings also a French horn and later I think the trombone these are calls of great distance as though they are angels calling the souls to judgment The soloist enter an alternate with the chorus sometimes the men by themselves and sometimes the lady voices only but as they swell to a climactic and with all of the brass both on stage and backstage with the pipe organ we come to a magnificent monumental climax to one of the great symphonies of this or any century.<br /><br />  And the final symphonies 78 and nine and the uncompleted  10th finished off in performing version by Derek Cook represent his closing of his life and his farewell perhaps to life tonality and possibly even to art Learning a Mahler symphony is more than just learning the notes the rhythms the presentations phrasing the styles and techniques is learning about the man of few composers the tickly mail composers are honest with themselves and Bertner sold to an unknown public is. Moller was I pray that his health will hold out so that he could complete this monumental project<br /><br />  It is to learn Moller as a man is sold his hopes and dreams and his fears Moller was a man of faith unlike Brueckner he never really found the face I don't think but he struggled and never gave up what is important to remember about Moeller is that for him the search continued as a perhaps still does to this dayressive Heartily recommended at a 4 1/2 star rating for the symphony number one and after tea break will look at number two<br /><br />  The Mahler symphony number two and see minor the Resurrection written between 1888 in 1894 was one of the very first LPs that I bought in my life I purchased it around 1970 from us from a department store in the south southeast

sometimes it is substituted as the first movement of the symphony but it also exists as its own separate composition the similarities with this and the actual first movement of the symphony on which it is based are striking The first movement is 21 minutes and 35 seconds long it is Mark allegro mise Dossow bomb takes a very majestic temple to this music stressing the dynamic range only enough so that it is not exaggerated it is logical it is tragic it is sad and it is mournful but they're also very warm and beautiful glimpses of peace the memory of you It has become customary for conductors after the first movement is finished to standdown offof the podium for about five minutes just to take a breather perhaps at water as he Worcaster and the course remains onstage along with the soloists after which we return to the second third and fourth movements which are also see collectively as an intermezzo in three parts Once again Moeller in the second movement the andante moderato of 10 minutes and 35 seconds turns to his favorite Lendler temples Falter elicits a wonderful beautiful Stringtown from the Columbia Symphony Orchestra musicians and a gentle plucked accompaniment by this orchestra the attacks are not too harsh but there still dramatic with a good sense of overall feel and not metal mutes used in the trumpets that Mollerus so famous for in this recording are sharp and clear and clean There is a lack of a sense of urgency in this movement as it should be it is seen somewhat as a recovery from the stormy and taxing first movement is very leisurely paced and quite refreshing vaulters conducting is very precise<br /><br />  Once again we hear Kletzville music that we heard in the second movement to the symphony the clarinet perform exquisitely I give them five stars and the dynamic range is believable and very well-balanced it is not exaggerated the noisy finale goes right on target with the orchestra as a swell to a fortissimo and then and the movement<br />  The fourth moving to the symphony Mahler entitled Ehrlich which is primal like it is again another Vanderhorn song is to be some very slow with a sense of longing but it is to be sung simply my wife and I had the pleasure of hearing this wonderful symphony performed by Spokane Symphony orchestra here in northeast Washington I do not recall the name of the soloist but she sang the song is if she owned it Performing here is a Columbia records Stellers*voice control to Maureen Forrester her phrasing is exquisite and alone I would say I would give her a five star rating The most poignant line in the Bundoran text of Ehrlich is this I came from God andI will return to God up to eternal life once the Ehrlich song has been sung by Forrester there's a brief pause before the final movement and we know that there will be a great outburst by the orchestra this is the movement of the resurrection where the course will come in later at the end there is a great explosion in the orchestra that dies down to several trumpet Anhorn calls from backs After the initial fortissimo in the stage is set we hear from the backstage and English horn call with tremolo strings also a French horn and later I think the trombone these are calls of great distance as though they are angels calling the souls to judgment The soloist enter an alternate with the chorus sometimes the men by themselves and sometimes the lady voices only but as they swell to a climactic and with all of the brass both on stage and backstage with the pipe organ we come to a magnificent monumental climax to one of the great symphonies of this or any century.<br /><br />  And the final symphonies 78 and nine and the uncompleted  10th finished off in performing version by Derek Cook represent his closing of his life and his farewell perhaps to life tonality and possibly even to art Learning a Mahler symphony is more than just learning the notes the rhythms the presentations phrasing the styles and techniques is learning about the man of few composers the tickly mail composers are honest with themselves and Bertner sold to an unknown public is. Moller was I pray that his health will hold out so that he could complete this monumental project<br /><br />  It is to learn Moller as a man is sold his hopes and dreams and his fears Moller was a man of faith unlike Brueckner he never really found the face I don't think but he struggled and never gave up what is important to remember about Moeller is that for him the search continued as a perhaps still does to this day
B00BAXFACO|2.0|I love Michael Connelly, but his over productivity is effecting quality. This book is ok, but it doesn't have the emotional grace that separate his previous books from the rest of the genre. He needs some time off to regroup and resume writing memorable crime novels. I would rather read one 1 keeper every 5 years, then 1or2 throwaways a year.  This one is forgettable.

Based  on a true story of the major robbery at JFK airport in NYC it is a gritty tale presented<br />strictly from the point of view of the criminals specifically the Ray Liotta character.

B00G15MDI0|4.0|It has been a busy 2013 for novel-to-film adaptations. Clearly, the biggest and most outstanding film in that club has been The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and World War Z also being noteworthy examples of prosperous films. But, one of the more underrated adaptions, taking place in the unimaginable setting of Nazi Germany, is Australian author Markus Zusak's story, The Book Thief.<br /><br />British director Brian Percival takes on Michael Petroni's screenplay in the film imagining of The Book Thief, a story taking place during World War II – a time that was full of discrimination, war, and the major purge of society. The main character is Liesel Meminger (Sophie N&eacute;lisse), a young girl that is adopted by two loving German's, Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush) and his wife, Rosa (Emily Watson). For sure, Liesel finds the transition period to be rough with getting to know her new parents, dealing with bullies at school, and attempting to find her place in a fascist nation. Fortunately, a young boy and also her next door neighbor, Rudy Steiner (Nico Liersch), quickly befriends her. After a short amount of time, the two are basically inseparable – but, a secret stands between them.<br /><br />One day, a young man knocks on the front door of the Hubermann household. His name is Max (Ben Schnetzer) and he is the son of a man that saved Hans' life during World War I. Hans vowed that if there was anything he or his family could do to repay the sacrifice, he would not hesitate. Unfortunately, Max is a Jewish man living in a country where he's surrounded by hatred and a government that is maliciously unrelenting towards the individuals of his ethnicity. With nowhere else to go, Max asks for a place to hide – thus putting the family in a difficult position, but a position they will not ignore.<br /><br />At the same time, Liesel has grown fond of learning to read, which her new adoptive father was more than happy to teach her. Even since she finished her first book, she has been willing to read anything and everything. One day, she takes a basket of laundry to the house of Ilsa Hermann, the wife of a well-off German official (Liesel's adoptive mother has been doing Ilsa's husband's laundry for years). The Hermann estate happens to house a vast library of which Liesel is instantly infatuated with and is allowed to visit often to read. Eventually, the business relationship comes to an end, which prompts Liesel to begin sneaking into the Hermann's house to borrow books to read (that she does return when she's finished).<br /><br />As you might expect, the complications arise from Max living in the household, along with the growing unrest from the events of World War II. Random bombings become a regular occurrence, throwing the entire area into panic and disarray. To make matters worse, basically any able-bodied male is called to defend their country, including those closest to Liesel. Emotions run high as she is forced to contend with more emotion in a short amount of time than most people experience in a lifetime.<br /><br />If you've read the novel prior to seeing the film, you'll obviously notice several different nuances – but nothing that's detrimental to the original plot. For the most part, the sentiment of this story is in the right spot, yet one of the factors that should have played a heavier role in the film is the impact Nazi Germany had on society. This was a place in time where the smallest indiscretion could easily lead to being shot in the street or put on a train to an interment camp. Still, the Nazi's are not depicted in the fearful manner that they could have been. However, keep in mind The Book Thief is a story written for young adults and with that in mind, this story may be a bit overwhelming for the same target audience in which the book was originally written. For someone who's unfamiliar with the novel, it might be hard to interpret the message of this story: a message that shows the importance of family, generosity, and survival.<br /><br />For me (someone that absolutely loves history), this film was everything I could have imagined and more. The story is certainly unique, but it's the cast that does a tremendous job of bringing these characters from the page to the screen. Sophie N&eacute;lisse is quite impressive in the lead as Liesel. It's a rarity for someone so young to provide such mastery in a role that has layers upon layers of depth. For such a young girl, her journey throughout this small German community is quite extraordinary. Initially, she's just a curious, vulnerable girl – but one act of bravery (or stupidity if she would have been caught) defines who she is: a thief. In fact, she might be the most honorable, noble thief in the history of storytelling.<br /><br />The supporting cast surrounding N&eacute;lisse couldn't have been any better, and that includes the performance given by her onscreen neighbor and cohort, portrayed by young Nico Liersch. He just seems to mesh with N&eacute;lisse perfectly, as he humorously courts her and values their friendship from the very beginning. Just as important as Liersch's performance is that of the Liesel's adoptive parents, portrayed flawlessly by both Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. Although Watson stands out a bit more (because of her strict nature) than Rush, they both prove to be the most loving parents a seemingly lost girl could ask for – and are absolutely vital to the development of Liesel into young womanhood.<br /><br />Surprisingly (especially for the non-readers), the revelation of the mysterious voice that narrates various portions of the film will have more of an impact than you'd expect. He pops in from time to time, but viewers would normally be safe to assume that it's someone that Liesel or perhaps the family will encounter somewhere along the line in the future. That statement couldn't be any further from the truth. Still, this unforgiving narrator leaves his mark in the final moments – which progress rather quickly after a lengthy war that's hardly described in much detail. To be honest, unless you're loosely familiar with certain dates or events in German history, a few events in this film will be lost on you (such as the reason the Nazi regime burns books in the first place or the seemingly random emphasis on the 1936 Olympic games). Have no fear, this small inconvenience doesn't weigh the film down in any manner.<br /><br />Overall, The Book Thief adaptation to film is an adequate rendition of Markus Zusak's young adult novel. It might not be everything you'd hope and dream of as a history buff, but the sentiment is there and it tells a moving story – not to mention John Williams composing (Star Wars, Jurassic Park). The ending turns out to be quite the handful and sadly, it won't send you home with a resounding smile on your face. On the other hand, the significant elements, like the cinematography, costuming, and poverty stricken settings all sell this as a film straight out of the early 1940s in Nazi occupied Germany. Even to this day, it's hard to believe how such a period in human history could even take place, and this movie serves as a brief, demoralizing glimmer of what innocent people were forced to endure. At the end of the day, all are encouraged to give this film a chance even though most will find the historical backdrop to be a bit of a bore.<br /><br />GRADE:  B<br />FNDNreview.comthat shows the importance of family, generosity, and survival.<br /><br />For me (someone that absolutely loves history), this film was everything I could have imagined and more.

B004TAAUAW|4.0|The Brain That Changes Itself is a book that highlights the growing importance of neuroplasticity and neuroscience through the personal experiences of numerous individuals with cognitive deficiencies. The author of the New York Times best seller is Norman Doidge M.D., FRCP(C). Doidge is a Canadian-born psychiatrist and psychoanalyst and aims to inform the reader about neuroplasticity throughout his work. Doidge effectively demonstrates his knowledge and understanding of the plastic nature of the brain by intricately weaving a work that is both a self-help book and an informative text. The Brain That Changes Itself is a fascinating examination of real world scenarios involving brain plasticity.<br />The publication begins by defining neuroplasticity. Neuro refers to “‘neuron,’ the nerve cells in our brains and nervous systems”.  Plastic indicates that the brain can be reshaped and rewired and is “‘changeable, malleable, modifiable’”.  Doidge continues, explaining that brain anatomy was once considered to be fixed, constant, and unchanging. However, slowly the school of thought began to change as more and more was learned about the brain in the 1960’s and 1970’s. Due to the information that was obtained over these years the brain was eventually accepted as “plastic” due to its dynamic nature. This revolutionary idea that “the brain changes its own structure and function through thought and activity” lies at the heart of The Brain That Changes Itself and is Doidge’s central focus.<br />Each subsequent chapter tells a personal account of the success of an individual who has overcome their disabilities through neuroplasticity. The range of case studies is expansive and varied. The publication dives into the cases of stroke victims, people born with cognitive deficiencies, patients with rare psychological disorders, individuals involved in accidents, etc. Each chapter discusses a unique neurological problem and approach involving neuroplasticity to remedy the problem. But Doidge does so much more than simply tell an almost anecdotal story about neuroplasticity each chapter. He provides an exhaustive discourse on each of the techniques, the research behind them, and its history that are utilized in that chapter. The clinical application of neuroplasticity is evident when considering each of the chapters, their personal accounts of success, the techniques, the research, and the history.<br />In one such chapter, Doidge details the story of a stroke patient and the revolutionary techniques that helped rehabilitated him. Michael Bernstein was an accomplished eye surgeon and avid tennis enthusiast. After a debilitating stroke, Michael became completely paralyzed on the left side of his body. The blood clot in Micheal’s brain cut off oxygen to his brain tissue causing cell damage and death. A MRI brain scan clearly indicated damage to his right motor cortex.  Although Michael may be the main individual in this story, the real star of the story is the constraint-induced (CI) movement therapy that he engaged in. Edward Taub, a renowned behavioral neuroscientist, developed constraint-induced therapy. CI therapy extensively rewires the brain and focuses on incremental training over an extended period of time that helps trigger plastic changes in the brain. It isn’t a perfect system though. The neurons that replace their dead counterparts are never quite as effective as the originals. Through CI training and some additional electrical stimulation Michael was able to rebuild a neural network for the left side of his body. He is once again a practicing physician and frequent tennis player. CI training has become more commonplace in stroke therapy. However Taub is still researching what time period and activity level is the most optimal for recovery.<br />In order to preserve the scientific merit of this review, I feel it is important to clarify the type of plasticity that this best seller concerns. Although theterm neuroplasticity is used almost habitually in the book, the type that The Brain That Changes Itself examines is long-term synaptic plasticity, rather than short-term plasticity. Permanent changes in brain function require cortical and synaptic reorganization such that altered circuit function induces altered behavioral. In each chapter of the book individuals use the inherent plasticity of the human brain to increase the strength of their weaker functions and permanently alter their behavioral capabilities.<br />As stated earlier, The Brain That Changes Itself ’s focus solely rests on neuroplasticity and how the patients in the book use it to their advantage to overcome their disorder or disease. While discussing the topic of neuroplasticity Doidge masterfully connects the genre of self-help books and informative textbooks with The Brain That Changes Itself. In a sense Doidge crafts a book that fills niche between the two. By presenting clinical cases and the science behind them the book is as informative as it is inspiring. Doidge’s ability to define and convey terms in a way that everyone can understand makes the book accessible even to those without a science background. By doing so, he is able to later delve into more complex topics such as specialization, brain structure, and more by building on previous concepts.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and Doidge’s work is as equally educating as it is entertaining. I would give it 4.5 out of 5 stars due to its unique and effective approach to explaining the concept of neuroplasticity. The extensive use of case studies to corroborate Doidge’s argument proves to be substantial and convincing. The case of Michael Bernstein, his stroke, and his recovery exemplify Doidge’s assertion of a plastic brain. This considered, the pattern quickly becomes evident and I found the chapters following a very similar sequence of events with varying details within each case.  I saw this pattern as repetitive. This is perhaps The Brain That Changes Itself ’s only failing. For this slight organizational shortcoming I felt the need to deduct ½ star and confer it a score just shy of perfect. In all other aspects Doidge excels in delivering a dialogue that intrigues the mind on the topic of neuroplasticity.

B00DJWV11I|1.0|It was ok. The comedy was entertaining, but  things got a bit cheesy.  There was just nothing different about this book. Bad boy meets  good girl. They have a  Love hate relationship. He screws up, reprints and gets the girl.<br />I liked the way he spoke to the reader. It was different and engaging.
B00B8R1NP0|3.0|I found the book to be just mediocre. Like the other reviewers have said previously, the story, even though it has a good basis, has a deep juvenile undercurrent to it. The way in which it was written seems to be targeted towards a teenage-based group of readers. Plus, the book had, in my opinion, inappropriate scenarios where Jesse Fairlane, Max Larkin's partner, seemed to welcome inappropriate advances from one of the case's witnesses. Overall, the book was o.k., even though a majority of the conversations in the book seemed awkward and unimaginative.
B00B9PIYZ8|4.0|The quality and aesthetics of these boots are very good. The leather felt relatively supple and the boot itself felt fairly sturdy. I did not note any defects in stitching or finish and the color was rich and warm. Following the recommendation of other reviewers, I purchased a size shorter than I typically do, and they ended up being perfect. However, I ordered wide/2E as is typical for me, and I ended up having to return the boots because they are too narrow.
B00DH7P6WU|5.0|Santa did good this year thanks to Amazon. Found everything I needed and I didnt have to fight the traffic or crowds, also the price of these dolls and the other Santa gift was actually cheaper than in the stores that I priced them at, even with the shipping added in. My daughter is going to love them.... And that makes Santa very happy.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Very entertaining and puzzling game. I usually play with my SO, so we have to play with 2 colors at a time, but even that is very enjoyable. The more and more you play, the more you will see playable routes in the game. Which makes it more fun.<br /><br />One note to add: A game usually takes about an hour, to an hour and a half, not 30 minutes like the box says.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|As always... leaves me wanting more! I love the Pendergast series !  Way to go Doug Preston and Lincoln Child !!<br />Karen Huber-Rowley
B00BEK6Z7M|1.0|I love Pendergast, but this is the worst to date.  Since Cabinet of Curiosities it has all been downhill.  Please bring back the thinking Pendergast and leave this shollow character of him behind.  My advice, don't bother.
0684857219|5.0|Wow this book is very comprehensive and full of great info! I recommend this book even if you are not wanting to to body building and just want to tone up or loose weight because building muscle is the KEY to losing weight and keeping it off and this book really gives a lot of awesome information on how to build muscle.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|A very enterteining, suspense, confusing, funny movie I watched on the big screen. This movie took me by surprise with all the twist and turns it took when I watched it since I wasn't impressed by the trailer. I recommend this movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book had a fantastic flow and I was drawn in so easily. It's a book that makes you feel and realize things about your own life as you.read along
0143119680|1.0|I love to read. This is the first book in memory that I intentionally stopped reading at page 49. Not only that I donated it to my local library. I do not get rid of my books. I absolutely despised Pure but I finished it and I still have it. This is also one of the few books in which my entire book club was in agreement: it was awful.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Since I got this game I have become very addicted. Which doesn't happen very often. Because it challenges me to solve each level as they get harder.
B00902AKK4|5.0|I'm enjoying this game very much.  There's a challenge to it and not simply quick fingers.  Add to that an adorable little bug that makes me smile.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|I will definitely be buying this blu ray when it comes out next week, especially since some of the proceeds will go to Paul Walker's charity Reach Out Worldwide. I have been a fan of these movies since the first movie came out 12 years ago and am still a huge fan. These movies just keep getting better. Paul Walker will be missed R.I.P.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|It's an interesting movie.  The photography/set is excellent.  However, characters don't seem like they are all in the same movie.  Kind of disjointed.
B00GK5WCV4|1.0|Was like the first movie, which was horrible. I understand it cannot be 100% like the book but I expect at least some effort to stay true to the book and yet again it failed miserably to do that.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Sentinel was by far the best of the series and the last in this amazing series. Jennifer L. Armentrout pulled me in with her beautiful writing, it was fast paced and action packed. It was great to be back in Alex's head because I just love what her character stands for as well as her snarkiness. This book made me cry which is very hard to do, but Jennifer knows how to make me cry. Half-Blood to Sentinel, I have fallen in love with this series and I was very happy with how this book ended. Aiden was even sexier and hotter in this book! The ending was amazing to this memorable and swoon-worthy series.  Greek mythology comes back to life with humor (mainly Apollo). Seeing the Gods made it more interesting and the characters in the book was great!<br /><br />The entire story from the beginning captivated me and was instantly hooked at the way the plot was progressing. Alex and Aiden are still a steamy couple and like in my past reviews I still love them. Alex is just as snarky and feisty in this book. This may be the last book but, Sentinel was by far my favorite with all the Alex and Aiden scenes. I just want to hug Aiden because of how she stands by Alex, sacrifices for her. He get jealous when Seth is around and I am proud of his character. (I wish there was a real Aiden!)  Apollo was hilarious whenever he come into the scene or make a joke. Deacon was also funny when he creates the name of the army.  The story really pieced together after Apollyon and it was 10x better.<br /><br />Seth is officially another character I have grown to love him in the past few books, but he really changed my mind in this book. He really changed in this book compared to Apollyon.  From the beginning of the series, I have had a love/hate relationship with him since the pool scene is when I started to become Team Seth but Aiden still has my heart. It was fun to read Seth and Aiden's bickering over who gets Alex. His true intentions come to life and they will surprise you.<br /><br />It was faced paced and I could not put this book down!! I am so sad that this series is over, but I am very happy with the why she ended it because it was perfect. This series is one that I will re-read over and over again. I feel like I have grown up with the characters since I first found the series. If you have not read this series I recommend you buy it now!! The Covenant Series is the best and you will not regret reading this book. Thank you Jennifer L. Armentrout for this amazing series!!s faced paced and I could not put this book down!! I am so sad that this series is over, but I am very happy with the why she ended it because it was perfect. This series is one that I will re-read over and over again. I feel like I have grown up with the characters since I first found the series. If you have not read this series I recommend you buy it now!! The Covenant Series is the best and you will not regret reading this book. Thank you Jennifer L. Armentrout for this amazing series!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a beautiful story. My recommendation: Read it.  You'll love it.  The words will come alive and fill you up.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I was surprised by this movie. I was traveling when the promotions were going on so I missed the hype for it and was not all that interested in the movie. But, it was on sale for .99cents one day and it was worth the price and I enjoyed the storyline.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|my daughter order this book because she loves history and this is one of he all time movies she loves to watch
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|disappointed.....very disjointed....plot was not consistent......this is not one of her best novels. I am a big Kay Scarpetta fan and was looking forward to this new installment.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|In my sixty three years of life I have seen quite a few makes and remakes of Superman.  This one conveys Superman more humanly realistic.  The way Louis Lane enters Clark's life is better connected.  Their love develops more naturally rather than the star struck portrayals of the past.  The technical work was exceptional!  This was a really great, fantastic molding together of an old story line; making it come alive in a refreshingly, exciting new approach!  I really loved it!  Keep it coming!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show is a close second to &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;.  The writing, the acting, the directing are the best! Don't miss it.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|It is the best role Robert Downey has ever done!  The technical creativity is fantastic.  The Iron Man series never ever disappoints the audiences, that's a for sure!!  Iron Man is a character bound in patriotism, underlined with a compassionate spirit.  He loves deeply and is very open as a person.  He is deeply devoted in defending our country.  There is a passion for him to succeed that is created between the audience and character which keeps you glued to the screen. As a military veteran it brings out my own desires of patriotism, drawing them out and refreshing my spirit!
0307744434|5.0|Erin Morgenstern is one of the rare authors that give literary legitimacy to a fantasy book. The magic of the Le Cirque des Reves is palpable through Morgenstern's use of imagery and appeal to the senses. The childhoods of Celia and Marcos, and their selflessness to save the circus that tied them together is heartbreaking. All of the characters of night circus are complex people that will enthrall you. The part I loved the most was the little &#34;Easter eggs&#34; throughout the book for literary lovers to delve deeper into the symbolism within. I won't spoil it for you, but a name is not just a name and a seemingly insignificant detail foreshadows a major plot development.
B003JIPJRE|4.0|Entertaining, but very graphic; not for young children. It is my teenage daughter's favorite who is an extreme Batman fan.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This whole series is wonderful. I have purchased Seasons 1-3 and am awaiting the release of Season 4 in January. Buy this! The actors and the writing are truly the best.
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|Excellent quality, looks just like them!. Fab gift for TWD fans. I wish Merle was still alive. He was changing!!
B00ESF285S|5.0|An amazing book for all to relate. A nightly read for me and my daughter for now and many more nights I suspect.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Wow, what an eye-opener! This book changed a former carb-lover into a carb avoider. In two weeks, I lost 10 pounds by cutting way back on them and my arthritic body has much less aches and pains! Amazing!!
B009LQKHIO|3.0|I would like to continue to know more about this primary family and how the future develops for them.  I will follow up soon!
B0081SRJSY|4.0|The tiles are well done, but it lacks the &#34;polish&#34; of something like Ticket to Ride.  Also, at endgame, it'd be really nice to get a final look at the board once final scores have been tabulated.<br /><br />If you enjoy the board game, this is a good mobile choice.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is more than a novel, it is a piece of Life itself. I have read and taught the great books of the English Language, and say with confidence that fifty or a hundred years from now, The Book Thief, will be in every High School Curriculum in the world.<br /><br />I wish that I were still teaching and could explore the width and breadth of the book with students who would at first resist, then read and 're-read Book Thief the way I once did Of Mice and Men, knowing that their lives are touched forever by WORDS!
0515149489|5.0|I loved this book ... It has suspense,mystery, dogs and their training, and, of course, romance. I also liked the friendships of that the characters had with each other. I had read it before, but I wanted it as part of my permanent library. I am reading it again!!
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Brings back childhood memories!  Loved this movie as a child, and I still love it now!  My daughter will love it!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|What I find most intriguing about \\"The Book Thief\\" is its narrator. Death suits perfectly the setting. Liesel's journaling style reminds me of mine. I would recommend this book to anyone 10 & up, especially if he or she finds WW II literature interesting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It tells a very good story about how your life can be influenced from birth but the right people can eventually make you happy!
B00G6MW68K|3.0|I have been to a few live concerts in Los Angeles.  Comparing to their previous recorded live, Mat's mid to high tones and high notes seem to be quite muted in this album.  The mixing emphasizes the rythm produced by the musical instruments and does not do Matthew Bellamy's vocal range any sense of justice at all. Their previous recorded lives gives the singer superior justice. The mixing cuts of the singers vocal range entirely in this album<br /><br />Muse could have done better to find a better mixer and sound engineer to find a better compositional balance compared to what this ended up mixed as.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game  is a good waste of time. Besides being pretty mindless, there's no such thing as 'progress'. The levels only end when you die, and  I don't think that is very good. It kind of seems like the game is  encouraging people to get nothing done. Also, if you aren't careful, you can buy gems  and coins with real money. The game  is  really fun, but not a good use of time.
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|Great movie and great cast! Found it very entertaining and worth the rental.  It's one of those movies you watch when you just want to be entertained and not have to think too much while watching it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty nice. I have researched horses and the breeds are realistic, except for the unicorns, of  course. ;) The reason that I did not rate this app five stars is because almost everything - outfits, horses, tack - is priced in gems, which take forever to earn. A few of the plainest accessories are priced in coins, which are much faster to earn. The game comes with a plain bay (light brown with dark main and tail) and the simplest tack  -  just a brown leather saddle, bridle, etc. It is possible to exchange the simple default paddock for a beautiful enchanted wood - for 300 gems!! The unicorns cost 325 gems!!! I have had this app for some time and I am nowhere close to getting that. However, I am really not much of an app person, so I don't play very often. I have always dreamed o having a horse, so this app caught my attention. What girl wouldn't love to gallop through an enchanted wood on a majestic unicorn?<br />  One thing I would like to change - earn more gems! Beware, you can buy more online for outrageous prices! For example, a pack of 450 gems is priced at 99.99 in real money.<br />  Horses are beautiful. Keep dreaming - But don't forget to spend some time in the great outdoors!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have now had this bag for over a year now and I love it. I used to own a much expensive bag but it was so annoying to get things in and out of. This is roomy and the compartments are designed well. I can be much more organized when using this bag. I love it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So theres already 12,009 reviews here! Everything i could say has been said - the books awsome! All these one star reviews - WHAT? I loved it, the whole series, beginning to end! It wasnt mind numbing to read, theres plenty to keep you entertained cover to cover. I couldnt put it down. The hunger games trilogy opened up a can of worms for me in this particular genre, lots of delightful worms!
B0000AK7AA|5.0|I loved this movie when I was younger and ordered it for my niece. She loved it. She's already watched it several times.
1451695195|2.0|Dr. Alexander's [[ASIN:1451695195 Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife]] makes the claim that, as a trained neurosurgeon, he is uniquely qualified to judge the truth of his near death experience.  Alas, there is nothing in this book that supports this claim.  Oddly enough, the \\"place\\" that he travels to while in a coma does not seem to be heaven nor does he meet the classical Christian God.  Nevertheless, he somehow believes that his experiences support both the idea of heaven and of god.<br /><br />This uncritical approach to his dramatic experience is prevalent throughout the book.  For example, his one paragraph \\"solution\\" to the problem of free will is embarrassingly sophomoric and reflects the level of insight that he brings to the other topics in this book.<br /><br />I give much credit to Ptolemy Tompkins, the \\"ghost author\\" of this book, who turned the doctor's notes and verbal descriptions into a very readable book.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This is a must have for aspiring authors.  This was not a boring how to manual on writing.  It was very entertaining and personal in certain sections of the book.  It is a good eye opener for those writers who want to be the next Stephen King (like me).  You get a good glimpse of the devotion and hard work it took for Stephen King to be Stephen King.  He also let's you know what he did and what he did with his writing to get where he is today.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|It has gigantic monsters and robots--even an unlikely love interest--and they ALL fight. What more can you ask for in a sci fi flick?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very good free app. The display is large as are the numbers. For someone like me who is blind without glasses I am able to read the displayed without assistance. This is a good 10-key style calculator. You need to get this app.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|I have to agree with most 1 star reviews. I have also been a big fan of Boston when I was growing up. I will only say one negative thing about this effort and that is, that there is nothing good about it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have a love hate relationship with this book because I don't really like all the scientific parts of the book even though it plays an important role with everything that occurs in each book. I love the relationship that has occurred with Tris and Tobias because it has evolved since book one. The opinion on this book depends on who reads it. It's not like the other two books in the series, but it is rated my favorite and most emotional out of all three books. I was crying from the middle to the very last word. Well if I think about it, I still get teary eyed. Read it and think about the message the author was trying to get across.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Everyone in my family plays this on a iOS device and am happy that it also plays well on my fire.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Best robot fighting game on the market. Definitely recommend this game . Great for wasting time and having fun. Need more combos
B001DJLCRC|5.0|the love of the father to provide for his family instead of thinking of himself  The acting is superb.  Yhe casting is a bulls eye.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|IT DOES NOT COMPARE TO THE WEATHER BUG IT IS MORE COMPLETE. THE RADAR DOES NOT SHOW MOVEMENT .BUT THIS ONE GETS THE JOB DONE
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Good implementation, but the AI can be a little weak at times. Happy to be able to play Carcassonne any time.
B00F9A903O|5.0|the game is easy to understand and so far i dont have to wait on neighbors to help me move up levels and i love that feature
B0081SRJSY|1.0|I really. Don't hate this but I can rate it as it did not download to my tablet Motorola Zoom
B000QFQE4U|5.0|should of won a Oscar one of the best performance ever given. great movie one of my all time favorite
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it . . . it infuriates me, but love it.  of course I recommend it.  But be very aware . . . it's addictive
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Only the best movie. Combination of Emily Blunt & Matt Damon was beyond genius. Definitely a must watch and buy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series of books and their movie adaptation to date are both 5 star worthy.  Dan Donahue/Author/A Glimpse from Christmas Past
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Let me start by saying I am a Withings fan going on 3 years now.  I have the 1st generation wi-fi scale that gives BMI measurements and uploads to the web automatically, I have the blood pressure meter that connects to my ipad and now I've had the Pulse for 2 months.<br /><br />There have been a few minor glitches out of the gate with this device not properly tracking or uploading sleep data, but software / bug fixes came out quickly and addressed these.  I love having the ability to track my daily step count as well as elevation gain and distance.  I rarely use the pulse feature as I don't run hard and my BP cuff gives me my resting heart rate measurement.<br /><br />All in all this is a great addition to the Withings family of products and I'm very pleased with it.  To those who've complained about losing it, I'm not quite sure how you are wearing it, but I clip mine to the waist band or pocket of my shorts with the clip towards the outside and have never had an issue with losing it.  I've done some pretty strenuous hikes through rough terrain and never once had to be concerned that I would lose my Pulse.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I love, love, loved this 14 book series and I am in a discussion group on how they might go about bringing this to either HBO as a mini-series similar to Game of Thrones;or if it would even be possible to the big screen.  Just because there are so many characters involved.  It would certainly put Hollywood to work in trying to cast enough actors to play this multifaceted list of characters.  This series of books and their movie adaptation to date are both 5 star worthy.<br /><br />Either way I can see Rand Al Thor being played by Chris Hemsworth (a.k.a. Thor)<br /><br />Dan Donahue/Author/A Glimpse from Christmas Past
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is some of the best writing and acting I've ever seen.  I bought the entire series and am now rewatching it with a friend.  It's just as good with the second viewing.

B0055OK2T0|5.0|Mary, my soul mate and beautiful wife passed away 5 weeks ago in my arms in our living room from a ruptured aneurysm. I am heartbroken and searching for guidance with death, life, love and the afterlife. We were together for 28 and a half years, almost 24 hours a day since we worked from home and I truly miss her every second. This movie was one that I would never have normally considered, but it is so moving a tale of true love, sacrifice, believing in free will and seeking your soul mate no matter the cost, that I was in tears at the end. I do believe in an afterlife and that there is only one true soul mate for each of us - we just have to find that person and then stay with them. I refuse to believe that death will separate us and if we find our soul mate then we must do everything to be with them. I'm originally from Scotland so not known for being a cry baby or soft person, but something about this movie hit me very hard and jarred a lot of emotional strings in my heart.  All I can say is watch it, then hug your soul mate if they are with you and hug/watch them every day that you can, and if you are not with your soul mate, but are trying to woo them, go for it and do everything that you can to snag them - and then make sure you keep them with you forever! Every second with a soul mate is worth a lifetime with anyone else............I found mine and this movie made me more determined than ever to find her again - Death shall not part us, Mary, nor keep us apart for more than a passing moment in the annuals of time . . so for this movie all i can say is - - - - Watch, enjoy .....and wonder!

0307949508|5.0|This series of books and their movie adaptation to date are both 5 star worthy.  They nailed it casting Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig etc...in playing their respective parts.<br /><br />Dan Donahue/Author/A Glimpse from Christmas Past
B0081SRJSY|2.0|I love the game, but it only gets 2 stars because it doesn't have the option to play others. I happened to get this app for free (thankfully, it was the free app of the day at Amazon) and with that in mind I'd probably give it 4 stars, but the usual price is $5, so with that in mind I docked it a few stars in it's rating. If I had paid $5 for this I would have been very disappointed.<br /><br />oh…also it'd been a while since I played last and was looking for how scoring was done, and let me say if you can review scoring in the middle of a game, I sure couldn't find it which was more than a little frustrating.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I am not giving it 5 stars as in tying in the many characters involved at this point it jumps around but the overall story is well depicted and amazing in content.  I just found the first 4 books were structured a little bit better and flowed a little more naturally.
B00BD6KPFU|4.0|One of the best shows on TV right now, witty dialog, compelling characters and above average stories make me amazed that this show can exist on a network as bad as USA. They claim &#34;Characters Welcome&#34; but in general I find that to mean &#34;Caricatures Welcome&#34;…but I digress...<br /><br />Season 2 is pretty great, and many of the problems with season 1 (for example EVERY single scene having to do with the miserable Trevor and Jenny and it being far too episodic) have been removed or tweaked at least somewhat in season 2 (though season 3 -which is basically 1 long case- is even better).<br /><br />If only they could figure out that Mike is one of the weakest characters on the show. &#34;Mike and Rachel&#34; has become tedious…it's Louis, Donna, Harvey and FANTASTIC guest stars (like David Costabile, Wendell Pierce, Adam Godley and Conleth Hill to name a few) that make this show go.<br /><br />My recommendation is to start with Season 1 if you're going to this show, there is a lot of great character building in Season 1 that bears fruit in Seasons 2 and 3, and if you did watch Season 1 and liked it, why are you even bothering with reviews?<br /><br />FOR THE RECORD: this review is merely for the show, I am not taking anything into consideration about the DVD's production or extras. They do seem at least passable (some commentaries and deleted scenes, etc) but I haven't had time to explore so far. I do wish this was available on Blu-ray.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Think you have demons in your life?  Think you just can't overcome your problems? Think you just can't take it anymore? Maybe you need a little inspiration.  This is one of the better books I've read, and I read a lot.  Adam Brown is serving as a Navy SEAL, an honest to God American Hero, when he is killed in action overseas.  His personal journey to get there, the things in his life that he had to overcome to get there...that's where the real story is.  This story is told mostly by the people that knew Adam. His family, his fellow SEALs, pastors, chaplains, high school buddies, all relate to the author their remembrances of the times they shared with Adam.  Please read this book....you won't regret it.
B00004TWZG|5.0|This is the version you want, don't get the theatrical version…the extra 20 minutes of the International edition transforms this film from mediocre to phenomenal. Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman are all fantastic in their roles.
B00G4I1CLS|4.0|a lot of information is given but it did get a little hard to follow since it jumps around a lot
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Language was explicitly vulgar, The language used should cause the movie to rated at least X or XX and does nothing to promote the story.

B0084B5TK8|4.0|Dracula is a great old fashioned tale, tame by today's standards but probably sinfully frightful back when it was written.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|What a great name for the latest book on agent Pendergast; if one seeks revenge, dig two graves. The book opens with with a chase from Central Park weaving through the city at breakneck speed to roaring down the Southern States and through Florida against time in a shiny red driving machine. This book reads like a ride at the carnival; first your careening around obstacles bumping into barriers when next you feel the speed pick up and start racing to read faster only to twirl and end upside down from a new twist. I found myself talking to myself, \\"that sounds like the brother, Diogenes!\\" And abruptly rereading a page to discern a new direction until you turn the page and Palm smack your forehead. What a thrill, what a ride. I thank you gentleman and await your next thrilling mind escape.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|MacGyver is good wholesome entertainment, my son loves his problem solving ideas.  Mac doesn't give up when it gets tough, good lesons for my son
0399157573|1.0|This newest mystery from Patricia Cornwell is so strangely written.  It is almost as if two people tag-teamed the writing.  Cornwell wrote one sentence of plot, then an intern wrote one sentence of &#34;context.&#34;  I have no idea if this is what actually happened, but the book is way to long, way too ADD, and way too dull.  I have enjoyed all of Cornwell's previous books (although some have been overly grisly), but this one was tough to get through.  In fact, I only finished it a week ago and actually cannot remember the identity of the serial killer.  Bummer.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Easy read.  Love the story line.  John Grisham does it again.  This book is as good as &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Love this game.  As soon as I reload my power I fight as much as I can.  easy to use and upgrade robots.
B00GX598FO|2.0|Love me some Bruce Willis.  If I could go back in time I would not have spent $5 on this.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love playing mahjong, it keeps me entertained and I can play it over and over all day long. To make it more entertaining I also try to set time goals, i.e., two minutes on each game for a certain Dragon color.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Funny game.....highly addictive....play all the time while waiting in the car at kids bus stop....makes time go by quickly...love it
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|Powerful, heart-breaking film that opened my eyes to the horrors of Sea World and inspired me to join the anti-captivity ranks.
B000T433CO|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! Got this for a Christmas gift for my sister. Couldn't pass it up for less than $5! What a deal! :)
B008PZZFHA|5.0|If you don't laugh at this outrageous attack on everything decent in the human condition, well...then don't. Not for the timid or graceful this show will make you smile. It's clever, thought provoking, well produced, and exists in a world of unbridled amusement completely unique unto itself.<br /><br />Either you like South Park 'B,L,U' or you don't. Either way as Carmen would say, &#34;I really don't give a c*#p!&#34;.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|This is going to be a stocking stuffer for my hubby for Christmas. Love the price (I think I paid $5) and love the movie! ;)
B00006J3WH|5.0|A great Buffy tie-in featuring all of the songs from the episode &#34;Once More, With Feeling&#34;. This soundtrack even features incredible artwork from Adam Hughes on the booklet. The booklet itself has some nice info on the episode and songs.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved this book, the story, the characters, and the look at life during the Occupation on Guernsey during WWII.  It was so different and so unique from everything else I have read.  You can't help but fall in love with so many of the quirky characters.  As soon as I was done I went back to the beginning and started to read it all over again -- I didn't want to say goodbye!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Finally Grisham goes back to his roots and proves that he can write another book as good as his first - well done.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Seriously some of the best television ever made.  I love TV that transports to another time and DA definitely does.
B002SF9YUM|1.0|I didn't even finish this movie.  It was terrible! I rarely dislike something so much but it was not worth watching.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Love having the map that lets you move easily and gives clues where to go.  Highly recommend to hidden games players.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is, hands down, my favorite adaptation of Jane Eyre. The entire spectrum of emotions between Jane and Mr. Rochester is captured brilliantly from the intense pain to the playful banter. A must-have for Jane fans!
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|I got this app and it works fine. But now I have a red box on my screen and I deleted the app. It minimises when I turn my kindle sideways. I don't know how to get rid of it! Heeeelp!
B0063GORYU|4.0|As far as &quot;Spider&quot; solitary its as good as any other that you can get. I have enjoyed playing this game when I've had a little to.e to kill.
B00GST8U4U|4.0|Great acting by Redford of course but a terrible abrupt ending!  The film seemed so real.  It held you to the end with hardly any words spoken.It moved along but all of a sudden it looked like redford was not going to survive even thou a ship was near and starting to rescue him but then it ended so sudden.  With the slow pace of this movie at least it could have brought out the end more.  That was disappointing about this flick.  Highly recommend this one anyway! An Oscar nomination for Redford for sure!!!
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Kenneth Branagh changed my view on Hamlet. Having read the play for my Humanities class I didn't like it at all. But, to give it another shot, at my professor's advice I decided to watch this particular interpretation of the play and fell in love with it. The movie highlighted for me moments and subtleties I had missed before and consequently broadened my understanding and appreciation for Hamlet's plight.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This ia the perfect free game like clash of clans and you aren't even required to pay anything! It has many units and strategies to choose from and if players are too hard for you, just play the campaign!
B005721W9O|5.0|Still funny after not seeing this movie for a while. Just hits home with the Star Trek crowd. Good for the family.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love SwiftKey. Have used it for a long time &amp; it is a real time-saver. Pay for full version... Well worth it.
B00EOARZ4G|5.0|Five stars or fifty, for one of the masters in the writing of military thrillers. A finely written novel, technologically sound and the characters are as solid as cement. They have been around for years and are part of the Americana of Tom Clancy writing, up there with Norman Rockwell. A fine read.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Most of the book was about the Swat Valley, life in Malala's family, the Taliban and how they treated the people in this 3rd world country.  Malala's injury and life afterwards only came at the end, so this really turned out to be a very good expose about the brutality of the Taliban fighters and the lives of those who only wanted peace and education for girls.  Malala's extraordinary survival and her activism for the rights of educating all young women is inspirational and speaks to the ageless ability to make major changes in our chaotic world.
B004LRZ2YC|4.0|I loved this movie mainly because it involved two kids, opposed to the usual adults, working through serious difficulties and sharing deep secrets. I feel it was well made, but it involved a lot of inferring. That's not always a bad thing, and overall I loved this story, but I completely missed out on one of the things you had to infer until my friend pointed it out to me.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I'd give this five stars except that it's not Great Literature.  That being said, I couldn't put it down, shed some tears over it and hope to hear from Bridget again.
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|It kept me very interested with its little twists, a great read you will not be disappointed first class brilliant
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|The series speaks for itself, if you have seen it.  But this collectors bin and how the disks are placed and relate to the movie are awesome!  Great !!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I'd like it to be easier to go back and forth between pins.  Sometimes I've seen a pin, but when I try to go back and find it again, I can't.  That's frustrating.  Also, I haven't been able to find out how to rename my boards yet, but that may just be a learning curve on my part.
B004QSQML8|5.0|Great Movie! This is a great classic movie that is always fun to watch year round and at Halloween!!!  Thank You!
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|I really enjoyed this game as it wasn't too hard nor too easy.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the &quot;escape games&quot;!!
B005H9B44A|5.0|I've been a fan of Thor since I was a teenager reading comics some 45 years ago.  This movie, I feel, does the character justice.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Easy read, and well written thriller. I'm looking forward to reading more of this author.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Didn't work properly right out of the box. Great concept would have loved to use it for my intended purposes. Also, the Chromecast has a long way to go as far as content goes.
B0095D4I8S|5.0|This is a screen classic. the only problem is that once you've seen it, it's hard to watch again. the ending is so brilliant that it ruins the movie for a second viewing. Nonetheless, I own the DVD and I own it in my cloud account and don't mind watching it for its nuances, timing and proformances.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This movie is amazingly well made.  Emma is not my favorite Austen novel, simply because I don't find Emma herself a very likable character.  I still love it, just not as much as some of her other work.  I thought this movie portrayed Emma faithfully while still giving the viewer some sympathy for her.  Also, the music is amazing.  I could listen to it all day.
B001O2QW9G|5.0|perfect for the photography project I had to do! fast shipping and price was in the range that I wanted to pay for
B005JABSB6|5.0|They came within a couple of days and looked great.  I can only rate them on the service by condition and speed of arrival for they are a Christmas gift so we haven't tried them yet.
B000SINT52|4.0|It's always interesting to watch Michael Moore. He always gives one something to think about. Movie was very interesting. ok
B0056BU3I2|5.0|I've always been a fan of the F&F series and this added to my blu-ray library. Great cast (Dwayne Johnson - Rocks) and fun entertainment.
B000641D2Y|5.0|We get the biggest laugh's from this movie. It was on our list to get on DVD means we have it on VHS. We decided to purchase it so We can enjoy watching this movie.
B000W1YYEK|5.0|This album signals when Rush rose in popularity with songs like &#34;Spirit of the Radio&#34; and &#34;Freewill&#34;, but the more obscure tracks such as &#34;Jacob's Ladder&#34; and &#34;Natural Science&#34; show Rush's genius.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Our Grandaughter Loves Taylor Swift. this Cd is on her Christmas list so We are purchasing it for Her. She will Love it..
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|An entertaining movie that really captures the excitement of a Big Year.  Non-birders may think this stuff is all make-believe, but birders know it happens.  And, in this case the movie gets most of its scenes right out of the non-fiction book.
B001OST0LW|5.0|This Batman movie was on Our Grandson's Christmas list. So We are getting it for them & they will Love the movie..
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My eight year old just loves this game, as she loves the undersea world its an informative game to create your own reef.
B000P0J06U|5.0|Our Grandson's have this Batman movie on their Christmas list so We are purchasing it for them. so they have it to watch..
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|Is true, this is not a Rock and Roll album like the first two; is more &#34;Deep&#34; and a less &#34;superficial&#34;. The early records were more raw; this one is more polish from the musical and arrangement aspects. The first records were meant to be listened when the people used to wash their cars, or go to a party. This record is more deep, and more &#34;Spiritual&#34;. You have to sit down without any distraction, and listen to it. &#34;Listen to the Music!&#34;. As an artist, you have to take risks, and get off your comford zone. That was the key of the Beatles, and this is what Tom Sholz has done. &#34;Listen to the Music!&#34;. I recommend this record to every Boston fan.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|I have this Movie on VHS so I wanted to get this on DVD. This was such a good movie so I decided to purchase it.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Malala, a child with an old soul with strength mentally, emotionally and intelligence at an extraordinary level.<br />Her story was heartfelt.  I would recommend this book for all to attain a glimpse of reality living in war conditions, in a mans world and fighting for education.<br /><br />Amazing  book.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Interesting movie with Michael Moore. So We decided to purchase it & add it to Our collection of movies that We have..

B0093ICOJ0|5.0|Our Grandson has this DVD on his Christmas list. So We decided to purchase it for Him.. He will Love watching Batman.
B00E8JTSVG|4.0|Oh how I wish I could give Beyond Oria Falls a five star rating. It deserves it on so many levels, It is unique, creative, exciting, it stretches your imagination, offers concepts and inspiration with salient advice, such as, &#34;You have to master the past or the past will master your future&#34; and &#34;Our greatest weakness lies in giving up.&#34; There is hope, idealized love, sweetness and all the things humankind in its most aspiring moments reaches for. But I found I was continually jolted from the story with typos and formatting issues. Without them, I wouldn't hesitate to give this read ten stars if they were available.
B00AALHW6Y|4.0|I Like Darius Rucker & Love Country Western music so I wanted to get his Cd with the song Wagon Wheel on it..
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Though usually not my genre, I find these books easy to slip into and follow along with the cases at hand. Being a Castle fan makes it easier as that I have faces to go with my characters. They are well laid out and will keep you guessing, with just the right amount of passion and heart pumping drama slipped in to heat the cold nights.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|I really liked this movie & I have it on VHS so it was on My list to get on DVD so Decided to buy this movie.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Here's a word of advice when it comes to Elizabeth Haynes' Into the Darkest Corner -- don't start reading it to get you settled into bed at night or to cure insomnia when you wake up in the middle of the night.<br /><br />If you do this, be prepare to not get any more sleep and to not care that you're missing it. Or that your eyes are becoming drowsy, but you just can't put the book down.<br /><br />Haynes' first novel, written during November's annual novel writing month, is a first-rate suspense thriller. When Catherine meets Lee as the bouncer of a local club, she's instantly attracted to him. Sparks ignite between the two and soon their flame is burning brightly. But is Lee too good to be true?<br /><br />Unfortunately for Catherine, the answer is yes. Lee is controlling, manipulative and doesn't want to let her go.<br /><br />Years later, now known as Cathy, she's struggling to start her life over and fight her OCD urges. These urges are having an impact on her professional and personal life. Cathy also knows that Lee will soon be released from prison and could come looking for her, despite her best efforts to vanish and get away from him.<br /><br />Into her life comes the new neighbor upstairs, a charming man who is willing to help Cathy with her insecurities and possibly learn to trust a man again. But as before, Cathy and we begin to wonder if he's not too good to be true.<br /><br />The story unfolds in both the present and the past as we slowly discover what happened to Catherine and what is happening to Cathy. Haynes' style carries the novel and she knows exactly how to drop hints and clues to keep not only the reader guessing but also make you want to read just one more chapter. Haynes also does a solid job of delivering twists and turns that feel earned and not like they're thrown in just to keep the novel's momentum going. She also avoids several cliches and had me second-guessing some of my assumptions about where events would take Catherine/Cathy in the novel.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good way to lose sleep, this is just the way to do it. I know that I'll be eagerly looking forward to the next offering from Haynes.the novel.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good way to lose sleep, this is just the way to do it. I know that I'll be eagerly looking forward to the next offering from Haynes.
B008WCP2KG|4.0|My Friends & I  enjoyed this movie. We liked alot of the Actors in it & it was just fun to watch.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Its a nice technological advancement by google. Replaces all the messy cables to the TV. You can watch videos on youtube as well as chrome. The only issues I have are that sometimes the connection is not very dependable and fails to recognize an active window. Also when using chrome browser, if you switch tabs you will have to relay the new tab again which is a pain. So far enjoying the comfort.
B00BPA7U34|5.0|Michael Buble is an Awesome singer. I had to get this CD for Me for Christmas. I Love listening to His Music.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A good story well told.  Good character development with a believable plot.  One of Grisham's best.  I highly recommend it.
B001E75QH0|5.0|We bought this for Our Grandson's for Christmas last year cause they really wanted the movie set of Indiana Jones.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have been hooked since the very first episode!  Season 3 has been just as wonderful! Can't wait to see what Season 4 has.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|&#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; is on Our Grandson's Christmas list of movies to purchase.  I am sure they will enjoy watching this Batman movie.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|It kept me on the edge of my seat.  I kept wondering what was going to happen.  Those are characteristics of a great movie.
B00008MZ0O|5.0|The Fast and Furious was a Great movie to watch. We bought it for Our Grandson for a gift. He loved this movie.
B004TACMZ8|4.0|Good device, hasn't led me wrong yet on wood stud locations within the house.  Has worked great in places where I know the interior wall finish is extra thick (old school plaster and lath).  The noise it makes can get on the nerves... haven't dove into trying to lower the volume as yet.
B00866JL96|5.0|I Love Nicholas Sparks as an Author & watching his movies on DVD.. His stories are so real to life.Got to watch this movie.
B003B02O0A|4.0|john grisham's books are always good reading and this one was certainly no exception.  well written, good characters and a plot that hangs together well. probably many people will be offended by the continuous use of the n-word and the blatant racism and some will probably  not like the ending but overall it is a good read
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This was such a cute movie. Our Grandaughters Loved this movie & still Love watching it. It was such a cute movie.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|everybody knows the story of how david slew goliath but probably no one knew until now how this was possible.  thank god for Malcolm gladwell  who is always ready to pop in and explain things like this in language that dummies like me can understand.  he kind of wanders a bit in parts of the book but on the whole it is very engaging.  I always learn something new from reading his books and usually buy them before they hit the remainder rack.
B00005LC1H|5.0|A great comic romp from back when funny actually WAS funny.  No bad after-taste.  Family friendly and delightfully, frightfully Un-PC.
B001BZRUR4|4.0|this  was billed as a young adult book, and while it  definitely had appeal to older readers it felt more young adult than zusak's masterpiece &#34;the book thief&#34; which appealed to all generations.  that being said, it is a beautifully written coming of age story with believable characters and a nicely resolved plot.  I would recommend it to anyone (and have)
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Such a relief NOT to have a drug-centric theme.  The actors play their characters well and the old cars are very interesting.  A great escape.
B00CR1DX9A|3.0|this book billed itself as the funniest thing you would ever read....it wasn't quite that but it did have its moments,
B00E4W40C4|5.0|This movie really makes you forget the mess X-Men Origins was. Hugh Jackman is back as the mysterious loner with a tortured past, in his coolest turn as Logan yet. Not quite the classic comic book mini that inspired, but this film has the right amount of Logan in Japan action to thrill this long time X-Men fan. A lot of this film has an indie feel that may turn a lot of people off, but it allows you to really see the comic book hero in an unconventional way. Of course there is plenty of action as well, including a nail biting fight on top of a speeding bullet train. The adorable Rila Fukushima also shines as Logan's &#34;bodyguard&#34; Yukio.
B0091X4EYK|5.0|Great movie. If you're a fan of the HP series - movies or books, you'll love it. It grabs your attention from beginning to end.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|This book encapsulates a lifetime's research into human biases and behavioural patterns. Kahneman always expresses himself clearly and provides fascinating insights into our irrational minds.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I found this story to be strange and depressing.  I did not finish it but, I am planning to give it another chance
B00GX598FO|4.0|It was good. I don't think it was as good as the first Red, however. It seemed less funny to me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I hate to admit how much I enjoyed this book. All the young people in my office were reading it and talking about it, so I did too.
1476747016|5.0|I'm a new Pusheen fan and I have no regrets buying this book!! This book is hilarious even if you haven't heard of Pusheen, if you have a cat this book will make you giggle! Sometimes I can even relate to this adorable kitty.<br /><br />I also think it would be a great book for kids. So I will probably be sending a copy to my little host sister who is learning English in Japan!
B002PQ7JQK|3.0|I dunno if this is a issue with all of them and a poor transfer or if i just got some bad discs but i am noticing audio cut outs on different discs in certain spots when using the enhanced version ( where audio drops out for a few secs then comes back ) which i find annoying as well as a few video glitches as well where it stops for a second or so then skips ahead and resumes playing. I can't remember every single episode it happens but for example as i'm writing this review it is doing it on season 1 disc 3 episode 2 &#34;The Managerie Part 1 &#34; at 22 minutes 17 seconds where Spock tells Mccoy he had no orders to take control of the ship on mine you just see his mouth moving with no sound from 22:17 to 22:22 then it comes back. This is what i have noticed happening all over the series on various discs. Now when i stop the disc and switch to Original mode and skip ahead to same time stamp and play it the audio plays there fine. Does anyone elses do this?<br /><br />Now these aren't long glitches or anything, Only a breif few seconds here and there on different discs i play but to me a &#34;remastered&#34; and enhanced audio and video should be perfect throughout and not cut out at all. Now maybe my discs are defective i dunno but i have read through alot of these reviews for this same set and found others had mentioned discs glitching and skipping as well even after getting replacements like it is just a bad transfer quality they did on the blu rays with the enhancements to the audio and video. So do i try and exchange them and try another set? Or am i just going to have same issues as others no matter how many replacements i have? If it wasn't for the glitches i experience i would give this a 5 star because i really like it. But right now i am debating on just getting a refund on it and just keeping my original unremastered sd dvd set ( the old yellow blu and red cases ) because they play just fine. I'd really appreciate if some one else with the &#34;Blu Ray&#34; set can vouche if they have this issue or not as well so i can decide on my next move. But as it stands right now i am not excited about this set with the current set i have.4; set can vouche if they have this issue or not as well so i can decide on my next move. But as it stands right now i am not excited about this set with the current set i have.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|Good acting. Interesting plots. I love the new characters and how they combine the crew of the Enterprise in with the stories.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it on kindle!  Have no time for WASH dishes or t v. Facebook's is even taking a back seat! Awesome challenge anytime!
B00DHQ208Y|4.0|I'm not sure if I, or anyone for that matter would lump Tame Impala in with the chill wave genre, but they certainly have a similar effect on me that chill wave normally would. I don't know if this is just how the album works best or of it's just me, but I only seem to listen to this album while I'm working, either at my job or different personal side projects, I seem to really enjoy the sound of this record when trying to get stuff done. The sound is great for kicking back and just being honest with yourself on what needs to get done while making you feel creative enough to do it your way.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|Loved how it played on the true ups and downs that life can take. A must read for those embarking on a new journey or those who have lost their way.
0307120007|4.0|Pat the Bunny is a classic. Toddlers love the interaction between themselves and the characters. It was my children and now is my grandchildren favorite. Only wished it were constructed better.
B004AQR29C|5.0|Great, Awesome movie, full of great stars and action all through the movie, loved it so much rented Expendables 3
B0086449YA|2.0|Not so great. gRISHAM USUALLY HOLDS ME WITH HIS BOOKS. NOT SO WITH THIS ONE! I CAN'T IMAGINE A SERIS WITH THIS ONE.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I have a Kindle fire HD. the game works fine but now that im done with it. I cant delete it.WTF!!!!!!<br />now its eating up space for nothing.
B00GX598FO|4.0|Really entertaining, has some action and funny as well , keep you inteteresting and surprise you in times when least expect it
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Twice I have paid for crowns and not received them..this game is a rip off do not spend money for crowns you won't get them every time .
B008602KQI|5.0|Very close to the book. An exciting and finely crafted movie. It keeps your attention from the opening scene to the last.
B000FCKL6G|5.0|Any one looking at transformation of there business should read this book, Mr. Gerstner provides insights to one of the biggest and most successful Corporate transformation ever.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved divergent and insurgent. So maybeeeee my expectations were too high. As mentioned before, the plot comes from two perspectives (Tris and Four), but I found myself going back to the first page of the chapter to understand who was talking.<br />we get to see a lot of Four... although is nice to read what he is feeling, and his fears and everything else... He need a little more of the strength that he had before.<br /><br />A lot of unnecessary, convoluted, irrelevant plots... The Bureu... Really??? there was no better explanation that a &#34;purity war&#34; and nobody had any ideas about the world before that.  I just think it was poorly played.<br /><br />The end. Well... life is not fair, there are no happy endings. I kept waiting for something to give some closure to the relationship, but as Christina said: life sucks!.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great love story ! Very dark in many ways ,but very sexy! I could not stop reading it! I must get the next book now!!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|You are totally caught up in the horror of day to day life during the world war II.  Very unusual perspective..
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a great app. Easy to use and very user friendly. The only problem is that I wish there were a few more advanced options such as fractions. Over all, really great other than that though.
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|this is a fantastic movie, older ones are better after all. I recon that none of the new movies are even close to this epic piece.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm obsessed with this game!  As soon as the baby goes to sleep I'm on it, trying to beat the next level. It does get frustrating when it makes you take a break, but it's nice to come back with fresh eyes.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Excellent song writing & mix of styles of music. Every song is interesting and carefully crafted. Great listen from start to finish.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it but I wish I could do at least one combination and I can never connect it to my face book I really wish I could do that but besides that I really like it :)v
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It is so good I just want to tell everyone what happens! U have to read it !!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|definitely would recommend it ,great book. Loved the ending. not much more I can say. It's a great book. the end.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Really detailed, the guns are realistic, and the upgrades are awesome. It's also not a boring grind if you want to be rich and have many good guns. You also don't have to pay to get good stuff, it's just there if you want to buy it. Really good for car trips and stuff like that. I don't just recommend getting it, I DEMAND IT!
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Haven't read it. Need a sample. The sample is a note from the author NOT a sample of the book. This is a high priced book by someone I have never read. There are many other choices for me besides someone who is so stingy with a preview.
B00E9A656K|3.0|If you don't want to spend a lot of money, then you have to race and race and race and race just to buy things like a Mini Cooper. Also, you get 1000 spam messages telling to upgrade your car. It's fun to play for a few minutes but it gets boring because you only have to control the gas and shifts. It's just repetitively boring
B00BKBCF38|4.0|Ghost B.C.’s sophomore album has been lauded by just about everyone from Phil Anselmo to Opeth. But this might actually give you the wrong impression about “Infestissumam” because it in no way, shape or form is a brutal record, or even very heavy one, at that. And despite its prevalent use of Black Sabbath riffing, his reviewer thinks it would even be a bit of a stretch to call it a sludge or doom metal release. It is more along the lines of stoner metal-influenced hard rock.<br /><br />Deep Purple is the most obvious influence on “Infestissumam,” but there most certainly are other sources of inspiration present, here, as well. Rainbow comes to mind, as do Ozzy Osbourne and Led Zeppelin. And, of course, as with any stoner rock/metal release, it should almost be implied that there is a very strong Sabbath breeze coursing throughout these ten songs, as well. Heavy traces of Pentagram can be heard, too.<br /><br />The darkly chanting vocals in the title track make it serve as a terrifically ominous intro song, and one that flows perfectly into “Per Aspera Ad Inferi,” which is the record’s heaviest cut, hands down. It has dreary melodic vocals and looming, haunting keyboard flourishes, sure, but these two attributes are outweighed by the track’s abundance of big, fat, Sabbath-y guitar licks, chugging bass lines, and dramatic-sounding drum rolls. Up next is “Secular Haze,” which finds memorable vocal patterns and ominously steady, humming bass notes providing the soundtrack for big, meaty, Tony Iommi-esque guitar grind. And also on the heavier front, the rhythmically staccato crunch of “Jigolo Har Megiddo” is threaded by slapped, grumbling bass lines.<br /><br />But it is after that that melody comes to the forefront of the mix, with “Ghuleh/Zombie Queen” primarily being a trippy, piano-based ballad with bluesy backing guitar leads. It makes for one really ethereal number, even if it is one that does eventually adopt a few momentously big power chords and bottom-heavy bass grumbles. And then comes “Year Zero,” a dark and again ominous mood-enhancer of a track -- and, contrary to what its title may lead you to believe, NOT a Nine Inch Nails cover.<br /><br />“Body And Blood” is a surprisingly lively and up-tempo (if still not exactly fast) stoner metal rocker; and the bass-driven “Idolatrine” continues this aggressive notion, with the bass sounding especially fat and meaty. But this tune is also home to a hooky, bobbing beat, barbed guitars, and the Ghost B.C. frontman’s usual Beatles-meets-Led Zeppelin-influenced vocal stylings. “Depth Of Satan’s Eyes” is also quite heavy and crunchy, as it drops in plenty of big and memorable, chugging, doom metal-derived riffs to provide the musical backdrop to distorted bass grumbles and noteworthy lyricism. (Here, the lyrics concern almost Wolfmother-worthy nether-worldly, fantastical matters like Hell and vortexes.)<br /><br />Speaking of Wolfmother, Ghost B.C. are sure to impress all fans of that band, as well as admirers of Bigelf, Priestess, Early Man, Graveyard, and the like, too. And while “Infestissumam” could definitely stand to be a touch or two heavier, it is, nonetheless, a very rewarding and solid album from a promising new hard rock/heavy metal prospect. The musicianship on display all throughout these ten tracks is good, the vocals are exceptional, and the songwriting isn’t too shabby, either.wer chords and bottom-heavy bass grumbles.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|I watched Les Miserables show in Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco and really enjoyed the show. I have been wanting to read the book and I have to say that this book was little complicated to read and since I watched the show I think I was able to get it. But, all in all its a great story and its a classic and I would recommend this book any one.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I'm excited to find a great new (to me) author! I can't wait to read everything she's written. Great character development and a real page turner.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game! My children really enjoy very much and the keys are very similar to Temple run and subway, the animation is awesome.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I didn't expect to enjoy the book very much.  Although I had always admired Lincoln, I was raised in a southern household still in a depression that began with the Civil War.  My ancestors were the poor, uneducated, hard-scrabble immigrants from the British Isles, just trying to escape English rule and the feudal system (see Brave Hearts).  They settled in the hill country and slaves were the last thing on their minds.  So, for them, the Civil War was not a grand attempt to save the old south and it's wonderful way of life; it was just a disaster.<br />  I have always believed that had Lincoln lived, Reconstruction might have actually involved some reconstruction.  I learned so much from the book!  I have no doubt now that Lincoln's death was one of the worst disasters that ever befell the South.  He wasn't out for revenge or to plunder.  And he could lead men like no one else I know of.<br />  Before I praise the man too highly, I must acknowledge that he doesn't seem to have been a very good husband.  I know many men of his generation were the same way (marry the woman, begat the children and let her get on with raising them).  But Mary could have used just a little consideration from her husband.  She never got it from anyone else.<br />  I learned so much about that time in history.  I loved the back story of all four men who ran for President that year.  I imagine that Doris Kearns Goodwin tried and tried to write a biograpy of Lincoln.  Then said, to heck with the usual biography.  Lincoln's story cannot be told in isolation.  She probably found herself having to include this little bit about Bates and that little bit about Chase and some background on Seward, until she gave up the idea of a straight biography.<br />  I applaud her for finding a way to tell the story with all the main political players included.<br />  Lincoln put his rivals in his cabinet, got them to work together, and made most of them love him. He was a genius at leading men.<br />  I alsolearned that Lincoln really tried to avoid war.  I had not known that.  If the large land owners of the south had not been looking forward to a nice little fight, it could have been avoided.  Of course, in that case, the poor slaves of the South would have then suffered under slavery for another 30 years.<br />  Learning about Lincoln's evolving understanding of slavery and the necesity of abolition was very interesting.<br />  I do fault Lincoln for bending over to his enemies so far as to allow Southerners to pursue the former slaves or purported former slaves into the free states.  That was a travesty and a tragedy.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game nice graphics good story line and my 3 year old loved playing it . With the hint button he was able to beat the game and he loved that I'd get the sequel if that make one
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|The actors, the actresses, and the beauty of Spain. Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz are wonderful. The music was great too.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Clean fast app That works well on android and on Kindle Fire.  I love it and would recommend it to others
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|This movie is a Christmas staple. Its beautiful piece of American movie history for the family with a terrific Christmas message.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|The Birds is my kind of movie. I love it. Thanks to Amazon.com my library of dvd's is growing. With all my favorite movies. Good shipping as always . And a great product. A+++++++
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Classic movie! I loved it as a kid and my kids love it! This is a great movie to add to your collection!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent historical novel. Ken Follett did a great job of weaving the lives and experiences of the characters through complicated events of the time -- WWII. The characters seemed real to me and were well developed experiencing what I imagine to be genuine feelings of pain, suffering and occasional joys. Lives intersecting with actual world events and leaders made the novel come to life for me. Life is messy and complicated and often painful. People deal with situations as best they can often rising above grim realities and carry on. Follett captured it all. Good read.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Great movie and perfect follow on to the series. Can't wait for the next one. This is the greatest series of all the comicbook heros.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|.  Always insights on the problems of the south. Have read all of his books except the young ones.  Always clean language.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|My family plays this board game often and loves it.  This app is a very good representation of the actual game.  The only small complaint I have is that the bar on the bottom of the Kindle screen overlaps the game's play bar just a bit.  ENJOY!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This is a must see movie if you have any romance in your body at all.  The best movie I've seen in a long time.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I finally got to watch this movie from start to finish as I had seen only parts of it on my cable service. The length of the film made it impossible to fit it into my available time and I do not have DVR. It was worth the price.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Having never seen Downton Abbey, but hearing from others how great it was, I watched my first episode a few weeks ago while sick in bed with the flu. I got hooked on this show and became a binge watcher starting with season one episode one and continuing through season 3. I have not only enjoyed the show, but I have loved the streaming as an Amazon prime member. Can't wait for the new season to start in January 2014.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Good movement throughout the movie.  No dull moments, thrills around each corner!!  Great movie, cool costumes, great group of characters!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This classic by Dickens is probably one of the best. The beginning is a little slow, but it all makes sense why it was slow later on in the story. The rest of the book is a great read! (Reviewed by Ryan: age 13)
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Everyone should use this app. Don't forget to set up the folders to archive and share between a of your computers and mobile devices!<br /><br />Great service and APP
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Interesting perspective of the narrator. Historical information well intertwined with characters.<br />Should be required reading for all teens so they understand the reality of war.
B004QSYSZ0|5.0|Solidly built. It does everything advertised and my 4-year-old loves it.<br /><br />One warning for those with mostly Thomas or off-brand tracks - the height of the track that runs atop the Roundhouse does not match up well with most bridge tracks. Some clever engineering can make the track work though.
1451666179|5.0|This is the funniest, most insightful book ever written.  I bought six copies,  one for me and fibe to give as gifts.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This product is exactly what Google claims it to be. An inexpensive HDMI streaming media player. There is a notable drawback in that the device is mostly limited to playing the apps that have been approved/integrate by Google. This isn't something to take a star away for though, just something to note for people that want to buy this over devices that are 2-3x as expensive but offer more variety.<br /><br />The ChromeCast -does- come with the option to cast from a computer's Chrome browser tab, but in my experience casting from a tab is usually very laggy unless I bring the resolution down to the point where it is obviously pixelated and low-quality.<br /><br />The reason I took away a single star is because the Chromecast Netflix app does not automatically play next episodes as it does on my phone or computer (this may be Netflix developers at fault more than anything) and because Google has pointedly halted third-party developers from being able to develop chromecast apps for lesser known sites. One notable instance is a third-party developer that made an app to allow one to cast videos/pictures stored on mobile devices. Google update Chrome software, that app and any like it stopped working, and the development kit is limited to just a few vendors now (though Google promises to open it up to all developers shortly).<br /><br />In short it is as my subject line indicates. The Chromecast is worth the $35 for Netflix, Youtube and Pandora (Hulu and HBOGo if you have it), but it isn't perfect.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kids 6 to 10 LOVE this app!!!! I love that it makes them think in a bright & challenging way.
B000B5OD4I|5.0|I can't say enough nice things about this watch.  It's a rugged watch that can take some real abuse, but it still looks great.  This is a fully mechanical watch (no battery) which winds itself as you move.  I prefer these watches because the second hand does not &#34;tick&#34; each second, but rather many times a second, which makes it move much more smoothly.  This particular watch is a true dive watch, in that it's actually meant to go underwater.  I've had this one tested by a reputable watch repairman, and it lived up to its 200 meter rating.  I don't dive, but it's nice not to have to give a thought to protecting it from the elements, since I'm often out in inclement weather.<br />As for the watch itself, it's fairly heavy for a watch of its size, which I like.  It feels very durable.  The hands are large and easy to read, and the lume is fantastic.  You'd swear this watch had tritium paint it's so bright.  The stainless steel case has a nice finish, with some areas polished and others brushed.  The crown screws securely into the case, and it moves easily and smoothly into it's various positions.  The bezel clicks nicely when rotating, and it has a nice luminescent dot at the zero position.  The Hardlex crystal is flat, and has a nice beveled edge.  These crystals are less scratch-resistant than sapphire, but somewhat less likely to shatter.  I do not baby this watch at all, and mine has only developed the slightest of scratches.  They might even polish out.  I've managed to scratch the crystals worse on other Seikos I've owned, but that isn't a problem for me.  I bought this watch to use it, not to show it off.<br />I wear this watch on the included jubilee bracelet, although I've also worn it on a NATO strap in the past.  The jubilee bracelet isn't my personal favorite for style, but I find it very comfortable.  Seiko has improved the quality of these bracelets since their earlier models, but it certainly isn't high end.  The deployment is stamped stainless steel and has a safety catch, and it works fine.  If you're after a snazzy, milled-stainless deployment, you'll have to upgrade later.<br />All in all, this is a great mechanical watch for the money.  I wear this thing nearly every day, and I do all sort of physical work with it on.  It's nearly as accurate as an expensive Swiss automatic, and it costs a fraction of what they do.  This is a sports watch, a watch you buy and use, and yes, it will get scratched, and that's ok.  If you're looking for a museum piece, get the Rolex Submariner.  If you're looking for a watch that will keep time and withstand most anything you throw at it, enjoy the Seiko SKX007.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|A great reinactment of a true story showing what a waste of  men, money and time  this  Vietnam  war  really was.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I was using a competing weather app up until this morning when it wouldn't let me add a new location.  I blew it away and added AccuWeather, which is smaller but yet provides more information.  Excellent job, development team -- Thank you for a great app, and keep up the great work!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|OMG! These are amazing. Wireless so I can leave and move my chair without rolling over the chord. They have excellent sound quality. The surround is pretty good. It's cheaper price wise than my old set which broke 2x within 5 months. And they're logitech so I know if I ever run into any problems which I likely will not I will be able to get in touch with customer support and get it sorted quickly. They are also really comfortable to wear even for long periods of time.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I feel yuck at the end of reading this book. There's no plot just a psyched wife framing her husband. I expected atleast a good ending  but disappointed there too
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|The Office Suite that was preinstalled on my Kindle does not work (it will not open any type of file). So I needed to purchase OSP 7. It works fine, but it did not include a better font package, which costs extra. I am also not able to delete the Kindle preinstalled version.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game as it was entirely different from my norm -- alas, the game is to short (finished in two days) -- would have like the game to be longer.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I could not stop reading this book.  I can't wait till the next book is for sale. So detailed you can picture everything happening.  Loved it
B00GUJP9PG|5.0|I have only been using this Farming Simulator 14 for the past week in the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and find it is really addictive.  I got this version shortly after it was available for the Kindle Fire.  This version has the Multiplayer option which I was surprised does work on the original Kindle Fire, without bluetooth using Wi-Fi.  One weak point of this android version is that I haven't found a way to download one of the three saved versions.  It appears that this is not possible like in the Windows version but the price of the android version is much cheaper so I guess this is a small price.<br /><br />With this just released version, there is little information compared to the Farming Simulator 2013 which has lots of internet support.  It would be great to have a printed map of the area rather than learning to use the very small map built into the program.  Navigating seems a little confusing at first because the layout is different compared to the older FS 2013 version.<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with how much program this is for $3 or 300 &#34; Amazon coins&#34; which I used for my first &#34;coins&#34; purchase.  I couldn't find the program after I purchased, even in my cloud but when checking the next morning, it was there.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon Sanderson never fails to draw me into each story immediately.<br />I couldn't stop reading this book or any of his other books the moment I started it
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|Wish I'd read the reviews first.  Have liked all of Cornwell's books until now.  I will not finish this monstrosity.<br />1) I decline the invitation to watch a fictional character wallow in the Sandy Hook tragedy.  Really don't want to see where that is going, if anywhere.  If this story's timeframe lasts until April, will we be &#34;treated&#34; to a little Boston Marathon triage, too?  Maybe she does M.E. duty on the Cambridge policeman?  Really tasteless stuff and I'm not sticking around to find out.<br />2) How many opening chapters involve Scarpetta in a passive-aggressive little verbal dance with the never-appealing Marino?  Why, Scarpetta, why?  Will this ever end?  Is it all a bad (and boring) dream?  Just Yuck.<br />3) Kay's completely disjointed and bizarrely narcissistic stream-of-conscience alternating with whatever she is doing with Marino is completely off putting.  The only interesting character is the dog, and all the dog does is eat and poop so far.<br />Just stop, already.  Total garbage.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait until the next book. So much is happening and converging together in this world and so many unanswered questions.
B00F0N7JUG|4.0|A very cool movie,  glad I did preorder as I have not seen the price lower anywhere.  my one problem is the packaging design.  I know other people have mentioned it,  but I think they could have made a better protective case.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Awesome Series!  The actors are wonderful, set is great and filming is superb.  I am looking forward to the next part.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Let's me read and work all at the same time that is cool and helpful I hope when you get this you love it just as much as I do. I know you will;:) lol
6303168507|5.0|Compelling true story about one part of the Holocaust.  You will need tissues for the surprise ending.  Liam Neeson emerges as a profound actor in this movie.  A story that every person on the planet should know!
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|It was funny but there were a few moments that were 100% predictable. Still it was off the record funny.
B00GK5WCV4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I have read all the current Percy Jackson & the Olympians novels and the Heros of Olympus novels. And while there are some differences between this movie and the novel. It has to be said that any adaptation of a novel to a screenplay is going to see some changes, as there are things in the novel that might not flow to well on the big screen when they remove key elements from the story line when adapting it to a screenplay to bring it down to movie length.<br />That being said. Yes. I greatly enjoy both the books and the two current movies that have been released. And I really hope they release The Titans Curse in the theater soon.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Since the first book I fell in love with Eva and Gideon and how there love has so many obstacles in front of them to get to where they need to be but they are getting there because they love each other and yes they both are broken but they seem to fit perfect together but I think they will make it in time. Can't wait to see what happend next.
B0002HZSE4|4.0|Arrived very quick, packaging was as expected. I gave it 4 stars only because the paint job in the picture is misleading compared to what you are shipped.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Reminiscent of &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;. in this book Grisham weaves another really good tale. Just the right amount of suspense, family involvement and lawyer-bashing and good old fashioned story telling. I loved it!
B00632HWOG|1.0|Don't like it!!! Should of have left well enough alone. We should be given the option to choose to change or keep what's working!!
B0053FANS6|5.0|I already had all 3 Mummy movies with Brendan Fraser on regular DVD. I bought them on Blu-ray for the extra detail and high def picture and crystal clear improved sound quality you only get with Blu-ray DVD's. I was not disappointed and if you are a fan of the Mummy movies I recommend you try them on Blu-ray if you own a Blu-ray player.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome, love the simple setup and use. Can use from any device, phone, tablet, laptop. Can't wait for more apps.
B002HML6Y8|5.0|I owned this movie on DVD and since buying a Blu-ray player this is another one of those movies I decided a must have in Blu-ray for the added detail you see with Blu-ray and true high def picture and the improved sound quality is awesome.
B004XIZK5K|5.0|Simple and indepth detail of using Kettlebell by Pavel and your interest develops further as you read it.  A must for fitness enthusiasit.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just a fun game...Lots of challenges and the antics make me laugh :) For all ages .Just wish you could continue without having to spend $$$$.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I think that this was agood season of SOA. I like Jax character. I thought the character, Gemma played by the great Katey Segal did an amazing job in this season with everything that her character went through. The last episode was very suspenseful with the baby being taken.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Based on the comic book series of the same name, Red has an all star cast playing retired spies and assassins. The plot is witty and it's great fun to see Helen Miren, Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich as well as Bruce Willis acting as retired killers brought back into action.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|OMG she is such a great talent, and this album is such an artsy wave of music. There are few words to describe Lady Gaga, you have to just experience her.
B00FXMGI0G|3.0|Red was a lot of fun. It was an original story (based off a comic book series), the script was witty and had some terrific actors. Of course, when a movie does well, the studios want to do a sequel. Unfortunately, sequels with rare exception (e.g., The Godfather II, Empire Strikes Back) are as good as the original. Such is the case with Red 2. Although witty in parts, it falls flat when compared to the original. If you've got nothing better to watch, and you just want something mind numbing to watch, I suppose this will do.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is the best game I have played period.  I can't put it down except when I am out of energy in game. If you want a different game than your normal games you see on Google or kindle this is the one to get!
B000YHE4AG|5.0|Elf is the perfect movie vehicle to display Will Farrell's hilarious comedic genius. It's a witty movie that's as much fun for kids as it is for adults. A great family holiday treat!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book with my daughter.  We both loved it, exciting, suspenseful, excellent.  We watched the movie together after reading the book
B008JFURII|2.0|Boring movie for a 60 year old audience. Everything in it is predictable, with the exception of John Malkovich's lines and his delivery of them which make the movie worth seeing. Malkovich gets an A for his performance. He should win a best supporting actor in a comedy award for this. He took a handful of blah and made it into a great role with great lines.<br /><br />I should mention that I'm not a big fan of action comedies. I never really liked the Lethal Weapon franchise. I do find Downey Jr amusing in the Iron man franchise.
B00942G4UA|3.0|The movie is very informative in sharing how our food has been genetically modified and how they are using chemicals and hormones to produce good much quicker.  I did not appreciate the liberal agenda in the movie.  It could have been much better had they left it out.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love being able to use it on all my devices.  It is so handy to be able to access my kindle purchases from anywhere even without owning a Kindle machine.
159102594X|5.0|Great entry to an amazing world of characters and events.  All of Abercrombie's books are stellar, but you should start with this one to appreciate how his characters change over time.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I love this calendar app for Android! The seamless integration with google calendar is just awesome.  My husband and I both use it. I love it!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Kind of boring cause its speed based rather than board clearing strategy. You just have to mindless hit connected tiles.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is wonderful. While I agree with the other viewers that it's devastating, it's done beautifully. Yes, it could have ended differently, and I'd be a heck of a lot more happy about it, but I don't always get my way. However, this is an awesome series and one that I'm happy to recommend to others.
B002RPLY2O|3.0|Childs play! Whats to say its a cult horror classic, i mean really if chucky didn't creep you out a bit your just dead inside!
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Jim Caviezel has some funny, unexpected lines in this movie.  The plot is good and was enjoyable to watch.  Not a silly sci-fi flick.
B000IZ3CZC|3.0|Childs play! Whats to say its a cult horror classic, i mean really if chucky didn't creep you out a bit your just dead inside!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Great movie, great quality! I really enjoyed the story line.  It was very funny to watch, and I'm glad I purchased this even without ever seeing the movie before!  It is a great addition to my collection.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent. Horrifying yet beautiful. I could not put it down. The human spirit is extraordinary. Recommended for teens and up.
B00G8P2B4E|5.0|The movie was great it teaches chore about bullies.  However when I received my cpu the blue ray was defective.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of my favorite books from years ago.  Reread before the movie (good decision to remember the book, bad decision because the movie doesn't develop Ender).  A good book for main character development (and realizing flaws in leaders).
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Preston and Child never fail to deliver!  White fire brings Pendergast to a locale reminiscent of the Shining, but with a logical explanation. . .
B001FVV2X2|5.0|It is cheesy enough to allow me to excuse the more ludicrous flaws. The characters are well developed and the story lines are engaging.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|cannot put my pictures on it it interferes with my e mail which is almost non existent since face book except for junk mail
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is lots of fun a good way to pass time. I would recommend it to friends and family
0345548981|5.0|Amazing Book, with a lot of great insight into the diets and how our bodies transform when we use the right foods and exercises. Love Novak Djokovic, excellent Book! Go NOLE, Go Serbia!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|This item was recommended to me by a friend. I thought it was very silly, now I don't know if we could live without it! I am ordering another one just in case this one gets lost. It helps keep the binky in my daughters mouth, but also she likes to stroke the arms and legs and seems to find it comforting. It also makes it much easier to find in the diaper bag without taking everything out of the bag in a mad search for a binky. I will buy one for every baby shower I go to from now on.
B004CURZFC|4.0|It was very well done , great graphics, good story line..The characters took on a life of their own! very cute movie!
B0036G8IQS|5.0|Great book for young readers! So engaging and easy to read. Such an enjoyable story for both young an old alike
0375869026|5.0|This is an extremely insightful and thought provoking read.  My son is special needs and looks unique like the boy in this story and it was a hard book to read but very positive and honest.  Highly recommend to EVERYONE.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|This book is pure awesomeness. Jordan has a great since of humor that I can relate to. Can't wait for the movie. I recommend this book to everyone.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Too many pauses, need to purchase too many extras. Graphics are great and the sound is awesome. Just too many pauses to purchase more extras power, etc.
B00003CX8N|5.0|For those of us who love to read and admire paper and pen correspondence, it is extremely entertaining. I also truly enjoy movies with a British bent and this movie is one of those. Saw this a long time ago and bought a copy, then loaned it and lost it, so bought another copy.  I watch this at least twice a year and every time it feels fresh and new.
1451695195|3.0|the book was ok, I thought it would tell more about his experience in the afterlife..not so much about him as a person.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Love item was a very good movie and was a nice gift to give my grandmorther was very happy that it shipped and hope it comes soon.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Missing Christmas update the Apple products have the Christmas update y not the kindle fire version?<br />Need the Christmas update now please
B002XD8KEU|3.0|It was not as &#34;wholesome&#34; as I thought it would be.  There was nudity in the form of art and while I find some of the nude art to be beautiful I do not think it is appropriate for my young son to watch so I would not have children watch it.  (I watched it alone on my lap top so my son was not subjected to the nude art)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Make my chosen books readily accessible using my tablet. I can read them anytime, anywhere. No kindle gadget needed. Very convenient!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I wanted to read this book after I saw an interview on FoxNews with the author in which he was berated by the interviewer who seemed to believe that a Muslim had no right to write about Jesus.  (I don't know for a fact what his religious beliefs are, not even after reading the book, which I think is to his credit.)  I found his writing to be very objective; a good historical analysis of the social and political milleu which Jesus was born into.  The readers can draw their own conclusions about the implications for their religious beliefs.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I believe. This movie is my very favorite and I Truely Believe !!! The 1947 version is much a part of every Christmas AT my home.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|really interesting movie!<br />Jennifer is so cool!<br />i really like her.<br />but for the story it looks not done yet, i hope second movie will release soon.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Still enjoying this show. Never watched on TV. Can't wait to watch the next season. Love all the main characters.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have been waiting for so long for a game to come out like this I follow the Dc<br /> universe and this is the best mobile game of all time
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Some parts are hard for beginners but once the kids got the hang of it enjoyed it very much.Definitely recommend
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints, and this one was a page turner until the very end.  Finished it wanting to learn more about these characters; especially Jake, Carla and Hannah.  Trilogy, perhaps?
B0087EVHTE|4.0|I bought this processor for one simple reason: The price to performance ratio was at the time unmatched. And I will argue it still is. This is everything you need from a CPU, surfer, gamer or illustrator.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It is a pretty good game. I think it is original and pretty fun. 5 out of 5 from me.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It's not letting me log in my account and its not letting me make a new account someone needs to fix it
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|This is the FIRST Grisham book I am not completely engaged with.  Not enough character development and it is hard to stay with it!
0765325950|3.0|As feared, it had way too much to wrap up in way too short a space. He always said he didn't plan to wrap up every plot line but this was too much left unresolved, and the ending seemed smaller than one would have expected a planetary apocalypse of all time to be. Still, it was a good effort by Sanderson and a merciful gesture by the publisher to not leave us hanging. I'm very glad I was able to get closure on a series I read from the very beginning so many years ago.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Builds slowly. Very engaging in unfolding of story and characters. Started watching on a Virgin Atlantic flight and got sucked in. Had to finish the season when I got home!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|It's not that much different from the version aired in the United States. If you're a D.A. fan, you'll enjoy it.
B005544TRQ|3.0|The beginning was really good and interesting, but eventually the plot just kept being the same.  It's just like any other lawyer TV series.  So if you like those, great.  If you're looking for something a little different, this may not be the series for you.
B007HOD2WA|5.0|The 2005 film \\"Hostel\\" was without doubt the most petrifying...the most bloodcurdling -- THE MOST EXTRAVAGANTLY SADISTIC! -- shocker I ever had the self-imposed misfortune to (just barely) survive. Nonetheless, \\"Hostel\\" is done in such a \\"classy\\" way -- with a stand-up-and-cheer conclusion that is so euphoric (at least in comparison to what preceded it) -- you just can't keep from singing the film's unstinted praises.<br /><br />Be prepared, sensitive souls, to suffer the tortures of the damned, without respite, throughout the second half of this nightmarish descent into the macabre.<br /><br />If you're lucky enough to have them, the bonus features will aid in serving to take the indelible sting out of the film's otherwise enduring terror, by demonstrating its all-too-realistic special effects, and by interviewing the pain-inflicting villains and strapped-down, tortured victims laughing it up and enjoying a sportingly good time with one another.<br /><br />Shame on me, I realize! -- but this sado-masochistic trash, with all its grueling excesses, is taken to the directorial borders of the \\"sublime.\\"
B00594XOZU|5.0|kik messenger let me login good i love it nd since i dont have a phone any more to use kik i use the one on my kindle love it so much!!!!!!!!&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun and very addictive! I avoided it for a while when everyone else started playing, but was finally convinced to play. Not sure if that was good or not....LOL. Awesome game!
B005KDWUFA|5.0|This CD is terrific.  The songs are either sung in Italian or Spanish, by you don't need to know either language to appreciate the music.  However, if you're into words, there is a translation program on line.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|This was a great read.  Up to Preston § Child's standards. The setting and story line were quite compelling. Recommended
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|The is one of the best movies ever made.  It keeps you engaged throughout as you try to figure out what's going to happen next and how do the many characters fit in.
B00FQMVCEA|5.0|i am a kid at heart. after seeing the movie Cars (not all that thrilled with Cars 2 btw) i knew this was going to be a keeper too given the fact i have a &#34;thing&#34; for airplanes anyway. there are several parts that are Very Funny and i know i'll be watching this over and over.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Five stars .... Because I can dance to it ! *****<br />I always enjoy reading any Preston & Child collaboration and even their solo efforts respectively . Another great and entertaining read on the road ! I think Pendergast might have surpassed Repairman Jack and Sandman Slim as my favorite continued series character.<br />Thanks guys for keeping me entertained in many a long flight , tour bus ride from hell and Overlook Hotel stay.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Good game but wish it could do more well playing expansions are really good .on the right track to are really cool game
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I enjoyed the mystery and romantic twist of this book. Kept me reading. Looking forward to the next one. :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A wonderful series with caring characters and bold twists of fate.  One cannot predict who will return the following season!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book destroyed me emotionally. I was screaming when I finished it. It tore my Heart and ripped it to pieces.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I use it every day. Practically perfect in every way. It's simple but powerful, very configurable, and works on every device I own.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel always does a good job.  The plot is compelling even though I doubt an airliner can fly upside down.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Good movie with excellent special effects. The acting is well done. The script is Hollywood formula. I enjoyed it and the pace is good to keep you interested as you watch.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Great CD.  I had heard of her before the Oscars but, after that song I decided to get the CD.  The girl has pipes.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My grandson and I love playing this game..we have this game downloaded on my phone and kindle. even my 2 yr old granddaughter tries to beat her brothers score.
B000083E79|5.0|She sound good.  Old and new songs.  I think it's taken years for me to become a Cher fan again but, after DWS ya she is back
006202406X|1.0|It was like a different author wrote this book!  I LOVED the first book, liked the 2nd and HATED the final book. I have never written a book review ever and I love to read (I easily read 4-6 large books a month) but I was so disappointed with the conclusion to this series. It was painstakingly drawn out, poorly written, anti-climatic and depressing as all hell.<br /><br />I love to read series because I get attached to characters and enjoy the character development. This book had none of that… character growth was nonexistent! I kept pushing through the last book because I had to know what happened (reading the first books, I could not put them down! I HAD to keep reading, they were that good) but what a let down. This is coming from someone who loves the Game of Thrones Series, trust me I can handle characters dying… but not like this! Pointless, depressing, unrealistic and like other readers I wish I could wipe this conclusion from my memory! I feel terrible I was raving about this series and kept telling friends and coworkers to read this series. Wow, I'm eating crow now I was so wrong. The conclusion to the series ruins the whole story.<br /><br />This is the first time in my life, I have wished the movie will be drastically different than the last book, otherwise I'm not bothering with that either. I honestly never thought the day would come when I would say, the book sucked... maybe the movie will be better?<br /><br />As for Tris... what the heck.. I keep rereading that part like &#34;Where's the catch? This can't be right?!&#34; Seriously, DAVID was the one to take her down? Are you kidding me?!
B008602KQI|5.0|I do not think there are many people who do not know something about The Hunger Games. The books are fantastic and the DVD is very entertaining. This is the first of three movies as well as three books and it is very imaginitive and well thought out. The acting is top notch and one can't help but love and root for Katniss Everdine our heroine. You will mostly be on the edge of your seat seing the different sides of Katniss as she is forced to deal with one deadly obstacle after another while she strives to stay alive in The Hunger Games arena. If you havn't yet seen this movie it's worth the price and time if you seen it in the theatres then you will want it for your collection.
B003VWU2WA|3.0|The button came off when i took it out of the box. It's held on with glue that apparently broke free. It works well other than that. I could throw a drop of superglue on it.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Grisham is one of my all-time favorite authors.  That being said I almost crossed him off my list after reading this book.  It is definitely his worst and I found nothing redeeming about it.  My best advice would be to skip this one and go on to Sycamore Row which is back on track.  I felt completely let down by The Racketeer - nothing positive to say about characters, plot, or anything.  It felt like a quickly thrown together book to satisfy some contractual obligation.  I love the flow of Grisham's usual prose, his characters are invested with humanity, humor, some sort of interest.  Not in this one.  I speeded through this one, not to satisfy an urge to see the outcome, but more a &#34;let's get it over with&#34; mentality.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Wonderful movie for All ages to view together.  Good music, lots of humor but it has many important messages for everyone in the family.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|One of the best games. I really like And very happy with this game. If the games also interesting and fun. Love the graphics.
B00FGFVMGA|3.0|good puzzles not too challenging. i liked the game because of the hints as well. pretty colors and the ability to reset the game is appealing.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|A truly amazing group with superb talent!  And, I usually do not buy Christmas music but could not pass them up.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|The show is good even without angels and demons being the main threat. It was interesting to see the impala gone for awhile; that changed things up a bit. This season the boys face a new (or very old) threat that's immune to holy water, salt, iron, silver etc.
0316227706|5.0|I got this for a gift, but it looks so unique, I know they are going to love it.  This is a great gift for dog lovers....
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|This show never gets old or overdone. Even after 8 seasons (3 post-apocalypse seasons) the writers don't run out of ideas.
B001APM46W|5.0|Ultimate George Michael - Fabulous music, couple of<br />oldies that I never tire of hearing, beautiful new music<br />and lyrics.  Can never get enough of him!
B002JVWRAY|5.0|This season beautifully wraps up a story that's been unfolding for 5 years. Almost every episode has something related to the apocalypse.
B00168OINK|5.0|Blu/ray say's it all, loved this movie and the Blu/ray is fantastic. I do not need my glasses to enjoy it at home.
0920236251|3.0|I was really surprised how SMALL the book is... like tiny!  I was expecting a larger book than was delivered
0439882826|5.0|This book is incredible! The pop-ups are beautiful and true to the original Star Wars films. I bought this as a gift for my dad, who loves Star Wars. I was hesitant to purchase, because I feared it would be cheesy or childish, but its not! This is a great collectible item for avid Star Wars fans.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Left out too much from the book...could have concentrated on the struggle of everyday life a bit more for me..?
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This was a very cute movie. I had heard so much about. I enjoyed it and so did my grandchildren
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Is a good game. You play as master chief fighting hordes of reapers as you try to find the triforce and save your princess from the evil bowser
B002M9WW30|5.0|Classics!<br />Inspiring!<br />Motivating!<br />Good entertainment package!<br /><br />Not all the time Rocky wins! But all the time each episode is inspiring and motivating.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|perfect.  watched the whole season in one weekend.  just kept watching one more episode instead of going to bed, lol
0345525558|5.0|I really have not read much since college.  After reading thousands of pages a week, then schooling three sons....reading was not appealing.  A friend was given this book and suggested I read it.<br />I read it in a few days and enjoyed it very much.  Passed it on to my sister and she did the same.  When you start reading you will not want to put it down.  Nothing common about the story, and ends well.  I like a good ending.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I am sure i would have loved it more but it was a little over my head so i had too look up too many words, lol.  but what i understood i did love i would recommend it to anyone interested in us history
0545425115|5.0|Terrific!  Have read it and passed it to several friends.  Once you start it you can't put it down.  At least don't want to.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Watch it, you'll like this movie. It's not really all about fighting thats just a sideline. It's more about the frailty of the human mind.  And be sure to pay attention at the surprising end.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I have seen this movie many times.  I bought this one for my grand children.  They received it one afternoon and watched it two times right away.<br />It has a good story, lots of action, and an excellent moral.  Just a great movie any time.
1416955070|1.0|Take Supernatural, Star Wars, typical myths, and every other fantasy book you can think of, and you have City of Bones. And what's more? Characterization is very negligible. Clary never changes and never really does anything significant. Valentine is the lamest, most generic villain you could come up with. In addition, the side characters are crap. They are very two dimensional, shallow, and hardly have any depth to them.  Setting is also very vague and is clearly written from memory of a couple of short, tourist visits and generic description of New York City. The plot is totally typical with betrayals, &#34;I am your father&#34; moments, and a few action scenes. It is simply a bad result of reheating fantasy leftovers
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|My kids owned it and loved it.  Bought for my grandbabies and they love it too.  Just a very cute story for the babies.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Nice graphics, smooth gameplay, very engaging.  Two minor complaints: the tutorial is very short and is only helpful for learning how to use the controls, not for really learning how to play the game.  Also, on my Nexus 4, I seem to have to tap the &#34;OK&#34; check box two times, every time.  I'll have to do some learning online to get better at the game, but it's fun even when I lose.
B00A2IUHM6|1.0|My friend choose it , I did not like it. The story is  too far fetch ,Ted character was crude. Not my taste
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Donna Tartt starts out with a breath-taking beginning and develops her story meticulously.  The book becomes a deep study of the internal and external crises its protagonist, a boy who survives not only a horrific bomb explosion and its aftermath, but also endures a chaotic life that both precedes and follows it.  Tartt takes us readers to the extreme poles of ugliness and beauty as the novel wends it way toward its conclusion.  It is a little too long for my taste and so it took longer for me to read than I anticipated.  The beauty of her language, the intensity of her descriptions, and the unusual venues to which she takes us is worth the effort, however.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Excellent plot and storyline. Everyone should read this book so they can experience a true master of the written word.
B000T433CO|5.0|LOVED IT!!  One of the few movies I will watch more than once!  My daughters and I look forward to watching it whenever we catch it on Television.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been a premium member for 3 years now. I have found many ways to use Evernote that simply required some creative thinking. Rather than search for a new application to achieve some task requiring planning, organizing or keeping information at beckoning call, I have found that applying some creative thinking can often solve my problem. Sometimes I've done this on my own. Sometimes a forum comment sparks the idea. And sometimes I've looked at other applications and realized I can do that in Evernote. So the logjam of productivity is not so much the limitations of the program as the challenge to think creatively. 5 stars to Evernote. Still only 3 and a half to my creativity but getting better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|a lot of fun. very challenging. I can't stop playing when I get started,so make sure you have time to play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is great.  I wish some of the levels weren't quite so hard, tho.  But all in all, I love the game.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It's a good story weaving many plots together along with the history, although a bit like Forrest Gump - people just happening to be at Pearl Harbor on December 7th.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|Best movie ever love the 3 of them its really epic a bit redundant but in the end these movies are all for fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game . Very addicted.  Grandkids love to play this game every time they come over. Can't get them off.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|good plot, good action, it tells a story of human problems and how we show the true nature of man. and how we must pay for our mistakes.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works well on the Nexus 7 and is used daily. I just wish it was smaller in size to minimize the space it takes up.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This is a great calculator. The only thing that is aggravating is that when you need to use the sine, cosine, or tangent you have to tilt the kindle to get to the advanced numbers.
B009GEYX5E|3.0|Poor photo quality. We have many polaroid pictures from back in the day that still have better coloring at 40 years old than these did after 4 hours. It's a fun novelty thing if you want to get out the old camera, but not fantastic color. Bottom line is a great idea in theory, but not so great in real life.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the entire series!!!  All of these books are fantastic read...You must have an open mind and can't be a prude!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was a very touching story! Makes you remember how precious life really is and that every decision has a consequence
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I love the ease of this app. You can do a lot using it. Your set for the work you want to do. I love how your work can look so professional. Give it a try.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've ever seen!! Gerard Butler and Johnny Weston are great! I must say too that I've bought at least 50 movies from gohastings and ALL have been in brand new condition!
B002O3Z50G|5.0|I love the action of people really into tracking twisters. The human interaction of friends chasing and learning about one of the dangerous things that hits every years and countless times. Causing so much damage. The under deliable love. That's why I bought it for my collection.
B0092MKFIY|2.0|Was a bit disappointed that not all the songs are as good as Radioactive.  Was not worth the money for the entire cd.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|Just as I remember. I got Logan's Run today. I put it in my dvr right always enjoyed this movies. It's so entertaining to watch.
B007ONQ42O|4.0|I enjoy some great metal music and sure did love this cd.  It helps they are from my are too.  :)
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This a great and fun camera app. I have been using it a lot. Your pictures will turn out great. Made my art look so much better than other camera apps. I have tried using
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It sharpens knives, whether they're in pretty good shape or not. A rod for serrated edges, too. It fits perfectly into my knife's sheath, too.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I just love this series.  The only problem is that when I first started to read it, I didn't realize the series is unfinished.  I'm really hoping that the author is able to finish all the books.  So you will be good and hooked by the time you finish the last one out (book 5), but then you'll have to hang out waiting, with the rest of us!
B002MG2ATY|5.0|Oliver Stone definitely did a lot of research before making this controversial movie. It was keeps me entertained and thinking.  Acting was amazing as well.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|As a Newtown, CT resident, the first chapter of DUST made me so angry, I put the book down (or, in reality, turned the Kindle off) for a week or so.  That any writer of fiction would be so self-absorbed and insensitive to trivialize the horror of Sandy Hook Elementary by inserting a fictional character into such unspeakable loss is repugnant.  Worse, that the author would presume to know how people felt - especially those that came from outside of Newtown to help families bury there children, sisters, brothers, and mothers - is presumptive and exceedingly disrespectful.<br /><br />As a long-time Cornwell fan, I will admit that I picked Dust back up some weeks later when I was past my initial reaction and thought that &#34;she wouldn't just throw Newtown into the book, she must have done it for a reason&#34;.  Unfortunately, by the time I finished reading, the only reason I could think of for the inclusion of the murders on December 14, 2012 was that Ms. Cornwell had written a novel that was so boring and poorly written, her editors probably insisted that she go back and insert the tragedy into the plot just to sell the book.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, this is, sadly, the last Patricia Cornwell novel that I will buy.
B003B5M0PO|3.0|I hate having to give only three stars for this pleasant but rather adolescent read.  It would be a lovely read for a younger reader than I but I was expecting more.  I understand Michael Morpurgo is better known for writing chnildren's books so perhaps that influence comes through clearly in this new approach.  Having said that I must say I did enjoy the book, I liked the simplicity, the emotion, the sensitivity and the insight into the awfullness of war as depicted in this lovely story of a horse and his many owners.  It takes us from his early days, and beguilingly it is told in his own words - it is the horse who is telling his own story - on a farm, the relationship he enjoyed with his young owner and moves on from there to his rather abrupt removal from his idyllic life to his training to become a war horse.  Then it moves on to the reality of life in a war zone.  It gives a fine insight into the realities of that ordeal as well as exploring the humanity or man in dreadful conditions and sadly, the inhumanity of man too.  I would recommend it for younger readers - just a tad too Disneyland for me particularly the accidental meet of a dear friend.  I will not say any more in case I spoil it.  Enjoy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great application. Keep in mind that Kindle, is not just for Kindle! There is Kindle for Apple, Ipad, Ipod, Windows, (XP, 7, and 8), as well as Android devices like phones, and tablets! Download that application, install it, sign in, and start reading. You can have all of your books with you where ever you go, thus avoiding those long, awkward moments of sitting, and staring off into space while eating out, or waiting in line.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I do not know why my tablet wont let it open,but if it did I think it would be a great game,I love styling hair,playing with hair for fun,all that stuff!
B004FOA84A|1.0|It had a lot of hiccups and was not responding well so I just stopped playing it.  Also, the activation of some of the hiding places was glitchy!
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|Seemed like it was written to be made into a movie. Interesting, but commercial.  I kept trying to figure out who would play the lead.  Too bad.
B00E9ZATTY|5.0|Got this movie within 2 days (thank you Prime!).<br /><br />This movie was FANTASTIC! As good as the first if not better! Definitely recommend it for people of ALL ages.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham is a master at storytelling but I probably will not read any more of his books because he has greatly increased the amount of profanity in his work.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is so much easier to play than Facebook because I don't always have access to internet, yet I can still play offline without losing my place until I get to a place with wi-fi
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was a great book lots of action and humor fun crazy nuts a overall great book for every age
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|The game is fine but it is really frustrating when you can't move sequences over to a new cell. In the tutorial it shows that you can up to 3 (which is annoying that it only allows a sequence of 3 to be moved at a time )but it sometimes won't even allow that making it impossible to do anything. If they fix the sequence moves this would be a really good game.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|Was exactly as described.  Haven't tried the BluRay or Digital copies, however the DVDs have worked flawlessly.  The grandchildren loved it!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Easily my favorite Christmas album. These guys are so creative and talented. I am always excited when they come out with new stuff because I know it will be awesome!
0399171541|2.0|The book don't have any plastic protection, was open, like if it was used, and the dust cover is wrinkled and printing is a little worn out. The pastedown have a big big scratch like if it had pulled with tape. I can send a picture. I'm sad, because this is a gift, and i need to give it friday. I have no time to return it, and i gonna need to give it that way or spend again in a local book store. I've already bought other books on amazon and never had this problem, it's sad happen to me the first time I buy a book to give away.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Every time a new Jack Reacher book comes out, I buy it and devour it. This does not disappoint. There are twists and turns, fights and chases. Prepare to stay up late, because you won't be able to stop, once you start.
B00F9040HU|3.0|This is a really good game. I used to enjoy playing this on my computer so I was happy to get it on my kindle. It wasn't free. I paid for it and in the middle of a level it just closes and I have go back and start the level over again. This happens sometimes two and three times while I'm playing. Fix this and I'll give it five stars.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Awesome<br />..this is the best.. game I have ever played on my phone or tablets. Just played the first couple of rounds
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|This set is wonderful since it has the online copy as well as the discs! The bonus content is also great!
0385474547|2.0|Was too old and misused. Some pages were torn although I needed the book for my library. Though price said it.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Its a very well made game, runs flawlessly on my S4. I Picked it up when Amazon had it on as their free app of the week.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Powerful thriller. An excellent movie.  Excellent Cast. Beautiful to see. I just see this movie a couple of times. Is just perfect for any moment.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins depicts a very effective way of how good to great companies reach their goals based on the methods that certain companies do in order to become from good to great by seeing what level of leadership is to how to put the right people on the bus to also how confronting the brutal facts to overcome the difficulties that were set before and creating a hedgehog concept to realizing how technology doesn't necessarily create companies to become great over time.  The overall concept is to create something for company to be built to last in order to successfully create a good to great company.  Overall this book creates ideals that can potentially make any company become from good to great as long as one has the vision as well as looking at the brutal facts and bring the right people on the bus.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|There is nothing I didn't like! Isn't the point of reading a novel to be entertained but also be your own entertainer? Stephen King is the master imagination provoker. He takes my mind by the hand and leads it to places it could never find on its own. The story of Danny Torrence the adult needed to be told. I didn't even know I had been waiting to hear it!
B002BVQU5A|5.0|How can you not love a Johnny Depp movie? It's a simple story with a good feel mood! So cute!! Great characters, great love story and great music!! It's just a good no brainer romantic movie.....how can you go wrong with that?!
B00D7JGL36|4.0|We have liked Vince Gill for several years. His singing and guitar playing combines well with great steel playing and some classic songs from the big Bake.
B004KB8P3E|5.0|I'm obsessed with Evita - her story, the music, the whole movie!! I know the critics bashed it, but I loved it!! Yet another movie I've watched over & over!! I LOVE the music....it's so much fun to sing to and then I end up singing for days after watching!!  Evita was a very interesting woman who had a good MO, it just got out of hand!!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|If you like a good hack and slash game then give it a try I'm still a low level guy so it's cool so far.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a great app that continues to get better.  I refer to it almost daily particularly when the weather is changing.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game , good music and graphics. Tutorial was quick and clear. I like that items are found in shadow and name styles.good work as always.
0553582011|4.0|The quality is fine. I was expecting the larger size paperback because I thought I had a handle on the &#34;name&#34;, which apparently is &#34;trade paperback&#34;, not mass market -? They should just call it 6 X 9 paperback.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|This is a nifty retelling of Cinderella. I liked the gritty science fiction tale, which was clever and entertaining. And, while it is sort of true to the classic tale, there is enough variation to create a measure of suspense.
B00A6L78YE|4.0|\\"Talent borrows, genius steals,\\" Oscar Wilde once said. If that's the case, then Jonathan Rado and Sam France, who make up the core of the retro-pop outfit Foxygen, must be savants: their 2013 full-length debut, We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic, as its goofy title implies, begs, borrows, and steals from just about every major act between 1964 and 1971. It stretches the applicability of Wilde's dictum to call this album a work of genius, but it remains a nostalgic if derivative joyride nevertheless.<br /><br />The comparisons to classic sounds begin as soon as France starts singing, evoking by Lou Reed's Sprechstimme, Blonde on Blonde era Bob Dylan, and (most frequently) Mick Jagger. Indeed, the Rolling Stones are the band's most obvious touchstone, evidenced clearly by the opener \\"In the Darkness\\" and the title track. But any of the Stones' contemporaries are up for grabs here, resulting in a patchwork sound ranging from Motown to Merseybeat to the Monterey Pop Festival. The production drives the point home, marrying retro fidelity to rich arrangements full of jangling guitars, celeste, and the occasional orchestral flourish.<br /><br />Highlights include \\"No Destruction,\\" which could've been a B-side to \\"Positively 4th Street,\\" and the wistful, Mellotron-inflected \\"Shuggie.\\" The album's centerpiece for me though is \\"San Francisco,\\" which recalls in many ways Scott MacKenzie's 1967 classic of the same title and evoking the Tony Bennett standard \\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco.\\" Foxygen takes their primary cue from The Village Green Preservation Society here, with gentle flute and a delightful Ray Davies-ish male/female call and response on the chorus:<br /><br />I left my love in San Francisco<br />(that's okay, I was bored anyway)<br />I left my love in a field<br />(that's okay, I was born in L.A.)<br /><br />This was the song that initially drew me in. As is so often the case, nothing else on the album quite scales its heights; but it's a gem nevertheless.<br /><br />My only significant complaint with the album is the lyrics. The highlights mentioned above also happen to be the songs make the strongest impression lyrically; but somewhat embarrassing lines like the following from \\"Oh No 2\\" are unfortunately too common:<br /><br />I was standing on the bed<br />Birds were landing on my head<br />Even though it's just a dream<br />I still don't know what it means.<br /><br />I don't really know what it means either, unfortunately. And when the music is this good, it's a pity the words don't measure up.<br /><br />I have long subscribed to the doctrine that originality is overrated. Wilde is right: we are all deeply indebted to our influences; better to say something important than to worry overmuch about being \\"original\\" (whatever that means). Foxygen clearly don't. And while this means they never quite stake out a unique sound of their own, it also means they get to write the kind of music they like to listen to. Which just so happens to be the kind of music I like to listen to as well, so it all works out.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Just a cute little story that follows the movie - and gives you a few more tidbits of information than the movie.  Really liked it.

1616550414|5.0|If you are even the slightest bit a fan of The Legend of Zelda series then you will REALLY enjoy this book. My girlfriend is a huge fan of the Zelda series and she absolutely loved this book. For the first time it gives fans a timeline in which the games take place and is filled with details about the series. The book itself is beyond high quality and if you're interested in video games in general its a pretty fun read, but definitely a must have for any Zelda fan.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Outstanding tie together of all the story lines. Now I see why my children are hooked on this series. Easy purchase process too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a fun puzzle game. I think it is entertaining and good for cognitive development also. I am happy we have this app.
B00B2166BS|3.0|This charger does the job of charging faster than the USB cable.  My issue is that it comes off so easily.  Sometimes I will set it to charge, then come back later only to find that it fell off and my tablet didn't charge.
B00FRMDH7Y|5.0|My family loved it! We watched it many times and laughed just as hard as the first time. A movie the whole family can enjoy.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The book was great and amazing but you really have to keep up and I totally recommend it. The last chapter was beautiful!

B00GNK18X4|5.0|I love this album.  I'm sure that other directioners do too and some will make you cry over it !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing! Loved every minute!<br />You feel so many different emotions as you read;  you grow attached to the character :)
B00FATEJYE|4.0|It's a great game and i have few problems with it. The energy requirements keep me from no lifeing and  the characters graphics and all are pretty top notch. I wish the prices would be a little less drastic or adding in rewadds,daily quest or something to get some good extra cash to get chars such as batman or doomsday.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I purchased Season 3 because I couldn't wait for the TV episodes!  What can you say about Downton Abbey?  Sublime!

1609611543|5.0|My doctor gave me a &#34;prescription&#34; to read this book.  He lost 30 pounds after reading it. I'm trying to beat him.  As an R.N., I really appreciated the clear and concise, well-researched  information.  This is not the same-old, same-old diet advice.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Killing animals without actually killing animals. Real fun. ActuAl movement is good. Graphics are very high quality. I'm very impressed all together. Great job.
B00CWVGS10|2.0|Loved all the books so much that I cried at the end the series! Like full on cry fest. So I expected the movie to be at best decent but I fell asleep during it! I thought \\" gee maybe I was just sleepy, I'll try it again when it comes out on video\\"...nope not just sleepy...it sucked. What happened? Well for one thing some of the characters in the movie (Lena & Amma) didn't visually fit the book (a big no no for film makers). Another thing was zero chemistry between the lead actors. That chemistry that made the first Twilight movie so good was lacking here. Then you have the actual story which is complex for a YA sci-fi but is also what makes it so great. Well they took the great story from the book picked the central character that everyone loves and said \\"let's leave her out of the movie, no one will ever notice\\"....what!?!? Whoever s idea this was should be shot. It makes the story harder to understand NOT simpler.<br />I'm so glad I read this book series first. The books are wonderfully fantastic! I devoured them like a hungry pit bull. However I have yet to make it through this whole movie (awake anyway) and I have sat through some stinkers. Twilight is just like the books...Game of Thrones is similar to the books...Beautiful Creatures does not stay true to the books and thus fails. I feel insulted that this producer took out a main character because he thought it would be simpler for the masses this way. What a waste of good material.
006202406X|2.0|I can't go over ALL the reasons I was disappointed by this book. It wasn't just Tris's death; it was SO MUCH MORE than that. I tried to make a list of all the things that were not good about this book, and it just kept getting longer and longer. Read it, just because it's the last one - but beware - so many holes in the story, the progression and pacing are weird, and a million other things make it so much worse than the first two. So disappointing. I think Roth's a good writer, but this just sucked. What happened??
8866135887|5.0|This planner is great because of the format. I use it as a very busy college student, and it's very nice to see everything for the week laid out on a spread.

B000VLE3GA|5.0|This song is great sounds a lot better on an ipod than any car I owned back when released. They don’t make music like this anymore.
B00003CXRM|5.0|One of the funniest movies ever. The character development is amazing. Top notch plot and every actor delivers an outstanding performance.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was a little inappropriate in some places and there were some bad words but the story line was great.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I started out giving it 4 stars but as I thought through the game and my learning I changed to 5 stars.<br />I'm new to these games and this is a good one.<br />I had one of their more difficult ones to start and was quickly stymied.<br />So, tried The Secret of Grisly Manor and was able to make progress and figure out how these things worked.<br />The artwork is first class as is the game itself.<br />You won't go wrong on The Secret of Grisly Manor... Good stuff.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|I love this movie. This is my second copy. I sent my first on to my daughter and I really wanted to watch it again, so I ordered another one. The story is typical Nicholas Sparks sad ending, but a wonderful story.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Other reviews say that it won't let them log in. It wouldn't let me either at first but after i reset my kindle fire (HD) to factory defaults, it worked. But not everyone wants to reset their device.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I have read the entire Pendergast series all the way back to Relic which was the first. None of the books have disappointed. The only bad feature is they are too short. You begin reading and don't want to put them down and way too soon you are at the end.  I can't wait until the next one.  I would highly recommend all to anyone who enjoys thrillers.
B000I9VZKW|5.0|A truly science fiction who done it.  It also provides food for thought regarding the &#34;humanity&#34; of robots.  One of the best robot movies made.  It is on my top 10 movies of all times.  I recommend it without reservation

B00E9A656K|1.0|It's nothing but a &#34;money&#34; trap. You get the app for free but being able to compete equitably in the game requires money, money and money. Also, I don't belong to any social media cite so accessing &#34;percs&#34; is not an option...
B00CRMX53S|5.0|My favorite song by Daft Punk along with Around The World.  Pharrell and Nile Rodgers from Chic was the icing on the cake.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use Facebook on my Kindle to check in.  I have a 17&#34; laptop and I keep my Kindle next to my recliner and check in instead of using my smart phone or picking up the heavy laptop.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Had to reinstall it after the latest up date, but after that it worked great.  I like being able to watch the weather vids without having to sit through 30 minutes of commercials like on tv.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Excellent movie all around. Amazing performance by Denzel Washington as well as all the other actors. Like others, I didn't know what to expect from this movie (didn't read the reviews). I came away from the movie feeling and thinking differently, and I quite like that.<br /><br />As a recovering alcoholic, I was truly amazed that a movie could capture the feeling of the absolute trap that alcohol is. There are other movies that straddle the same storyline, but this was deeply moving and in the end inspiring in the way that religion, love, and forgiveness can make all the difference in the world.<br /><br />The scene in the hotel room near the end is priceless... and every alcoholic knows that quiet knock, that barely perceptible call that  alerts us that there is alcohol somewhere close. This scene may seem hard to believe for others, but believe me it is very real.<br /><br />Everything wrapped up nicely when Denzel's character was in the courtroom at the end. I was truly surprised by the choice he made.<br /><br />Very powerful movie!
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|The game is so fun and addictive!  This game is fun for all ages and I can never put my kindle down.

B00GGEVKYO|4.0|Great movie for the Lord of the Rings buff.  It was a bit slow in parts, but overall it was a great movie leading up to the next Hobbit move in December '13.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|a fun book,, I think you will enjoy it. Just take the time to stop and smell the roses or coffee
B005LAII4E|1.0|Words can't describe this movie. It is so bad from every perspective. Bad fights scenes. Bad plot. Bad effects. Bad acting. Ridiculous.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Although it was predictable, it was a fun easy read. I recommend this for quick airline trips. Good romantic novel
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Just not for me. Too time consuming. I have other games I prefer over this one. I deleted it off of my Kindle.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Visually gorgeous movie combined with a wonderful story containing many lessons.  This one has got to be in your collection if you own a 3D TV.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Great prequel to the originals.  Full of action and suspense. Special effects some of the best I've seen. Great Movie.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|This is way much better than I expected! I think it would make a very nice present for someone that likes the show. I was expecting the DVDs in a regular box, instead, this is like a mini book with pictures from the show. It's super!
031623480X|1.0|The claims made in this book are complete nonsense. If you want to look at food as an epigenetic modulator look at Dr Dean Ornish's research on a vegan diet to reverse cancer and heart disease. He found approximately 500 genes that were altered from disease promoting states to health promoting by increasing the intake of complex carbohydrates and severely reducing the intake of animal products.<br /><br />Forcing the body into a state of acidic ketosis to break down protein into glucose which is the main fuel for every cell in the body and the brain, is not good medicine. It just means the body has to function in a acidic state which leaches out calcium and is very hard on the kidneys.<br /><br />The citing of \\"The Paleo Diet\\" should be a red flag because that book has no good science anywhere to back it up either.<br /><br />And while it may be true that modern wheat has been so altered that it is now dangerous to some people, that can hardly stand as an indictment of all carbohydrates. High carbohydrate diets have been repeatedly shown to promote the best health. You can read \\"The China Study\\" as a starting point.
B00DXPC1U6|1.0|Surely the actors involved were let down by the poor writing handed to them in the fnal 6 episodes. The set does very well for the first 6 episodes then just goes to hell with so much filler, cooking meals, and non plot related accidents etc etc and then just drifts off into the unknown, Deb's stroke and burial at sea !!!!!!!!! Ridiculous at best. The writer even made an apolegetic explanation the morning after the episode aired. The ending ranks right up there with the Soprano ending  .
0385351399|1.0|In the world introduced in ‘The Circle’, individuals become completely transparent and are stripped of their anonymity even when performing menial tasks. Mae Holland has just secured a position with The Circle thanks to her friend Annie, a high-ranking employee at The Circle. Mae’s involvement in the company slowly begins overtaking everything and without stopping to consider, her entire life ends up being put on display for anyone willing to see.<br /><br />‘TruYou changed the internet, in toto, within a year. Though some sites were resistant at first, and free-internet advocates shouted about the right to be anonymous online, the TruYou wave was tidal and crushed all meaninful opposition. It started with the commerce sites. Why would any non-porn site want anonymous users when they could know exactly who had come through the door? Overnight, all comment boards became civil, all posters held accountable. The trolls, who had more or less overtaken the internet, were driven back into the darkness.’<br />So essentially the only people that truly care about privacy in this world are trolls and people who view porn online. Everybody else is fully willing to give up their privacy. Right. Because that’s totally legit. And comment boards became civil overnight all because people’s real names were disclosed thus insinuating that the only thing encouraging people to state their opinions on the Internet was their anonymity? And I loved how the creation of the Unified Operating System, also known as TruYou, which basically took all user accounts and passwords and made them into one all encompassing login, revolutionized the Internet and prevented identity theft. You’d think if you only had one single password it’d be easier rather than more difficult to hack someones information but maybe we’re not supposed to think too hard on these technological creations of Eggers, especially considering his supposed lack of research on the subject. (“There were a handful of times when I looked something up, or asked the opinion of someone more tech-savvy than I am, but for the most part this was just a process of pure speculative fiction.” -Source) His lack of research is abundantly clear with the naming of his main invention, Unified Operating System, which isn’t even an Operating System at all. Windows? OS X? Linux? Android? Those are Operating Systems. Computer software that manages the computers hardware.  For someone that decided to write a 504 page book dedicated to technology I would have expected him to know that at the very least.<br /><br />It’s obvious that Eggers himself harbors a deep dislike of technology and the way the Internet is growing and expanding in society as that’s the way it was written, in a smug and dismissive manner. Each time Mae’s ex-boyfriend Mercer makes an appearance the opportunity is taken to preach his opinions about her job and what companies like ‘The Circle’ are doing to this world. It’s clear Eggers is the embodiment of Mercer and he used that character to push his agenda which is completely fine by me, but the opinions of technological advances were written as black and white where people are either completely for or completely against those advances. Personally, I found myself in a grey area and I’m doubtfully the only like-minded individual.<br /><br />Setting all that aside I really have to mention the worst thing about this book: the sex scenes. Not only was there a completely unnecessary romance, but the embarrassingly graphic sex scenes told from the point of view of a female were awful (not to mention the scene where Mae walked in on her parents? Served absolutely no purpose to the advancement of the storyline.) Maybe it would’ve been better if the main character was a male and Eggers could have made it sound like he has a modicum of sense in regards to what goes on in the bedroom. The bothersome descriptive words makes me hope someone will steal that man’s thesaurus. Here a few cringe-worthy examples:<br /><br />‘Then his eyes closed, and he went into paroxysms, emitting a brief squeal before grunting his arrival.’<br />Squeal? Grunting? ARRIVAL? No, no, no.<br /><br />“Sometimes,” he said, and breathed fire into her ear.<br />My. That sounds painful.<br /><br />‘She could think only of a campfire, one small log, all of it doused in milk.’<br />Okay, maybe this is a little out of context and hard to understand but there had just been an embarrassing sexual situation where the man was a bit too… quick with it. And Eggers uses a ‘small log’ and ‘milk’ as the descriptive terms. Good grief, NO.<br /><br />The Circle is at times a bit of a satiric story on the technological advances in this day and age but does manage to bring up some points that would be worth discussing. If it was a non-biased written interpretation on the future possibilities of technology it could have been well received (by me) but as it stands it was written too much like The Circle was ‘Big Brother’ and everything associated with technology is inherently bad. The laughable ending which involves robot drones directed by social media hordes that essentially cause a murder only solidified my displeasure.esaurus.

B0009IOR6Q|5.0|This was bought as a gift for a person who loves anything about Johnny Depp.  I have not seen the movie but I'm sure I will when I visit her.
B0010T75W6|5.0|Great and interestingly funny movie.  Loved the drama, drag queens and the music. Watched this movie as a homework assignment.
0307987647|5.0|I have never been a fantasy fan, but have always enjoyed Martin's science fiction because he always had compelling people in his work, something lacking in most sf.  So when he began this epic work, I bought volume one, hoping he would bring his same love of characters to the fantasy genre.  He did and I was hooked. Yes, these  books are fantasy: there are dragons and creatures and magic.  But far more compelling are the terrific and nuanced characters and the gritty, realistic war they wage for power in their world.  These are books  for people who want to read about real characters in real situations who just happen to inhabit a world more magical than our own.  But even they don't always realize it.  A wonderful, complex world to emerge yourself into on a long, reading afternoon.
B0089LOG02|5.0|As a history buff I always want to know personal stories of how events happened not just statistical jargon.This book tells the history of the orphan train riders from their historical perspective.It's one you won't forget.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I found the each character  well written and all the stories so interesting. I almost hated for it to end
B0081SRJSY|2.0|Very poor port of this great board game.  No multiplayer. Subpar graphics and ui  elements. I would give it a pass.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing book - great end to the trilogy! Must read! Would recommend to anyone! Wish there were more books from the hunger games
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Wow, the best in awhile. Glad all the main characters are together again. What a case, and Benton's problems with his boss. I loved every page of it and will definitely give it a second read after the holidays. I hope there's more to come.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Anything Michael Connelly writes is amazing!  I feel like I know Harry Bosch personally and I highly recommend this and his other books to the readers!
B005TPCQ5I|5.0|It was fantastic!  I experienced every emotion!  Bravo!  I thought both Jim and Anne did an excellent job being their characters.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|Good affordable CPU. I chose this CPU/APU because I was looking for an affordable CPU that could run a home server and a webcam surveillance system. I also didn't want to by a separate graphics card so this was a great choice. I haven't done any graphics benchmarks but I wouldn't depend on this APU alone to play graphically intensive games.
0547258305|5.0|Graceling was a rather enjoyable read, filled with enough action to keep you hooked, and enough romance to cater to a broad spectrum of readers. Graceling tells the story of Katsa, a young woman gifted with the ability to kill others, and her various adventures in this medieval-style time.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the book, the action and romance tends to switch off for large periods of time. For example, six chapters might be spent on some daring quest, then another five on a trip through a mountain, filled with kindling love and awkward passion. There is a good enough balance to please most, but die-hard violence fans or puritan romantics may be left wanting a bit more. Regardless of your taste, it is a well-written novel, with enough character development to get to really know those in the story. I would definitely recommend this to any young-adult or teenager who enjoys and smooth and easy read.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The actor choices for the characters were perfect. The Photography was great.  This movie follows book storyline pretty closely.  Loved it
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I am a big Harry Potter fan, and so is my wife. I have read all the books, and I have watched all the movies several times. I still enjoy watching them from time to time. The disks were all healthy. The quality is awesome. There's quite a lot of &#34;bonus features&#34; although some people think it's not enough (there are of course those who don't care about the bonus features at all.)<br /><br />The only thing that I wish was better regarding this item was the packaging. Not that there's anything particularly wrong with it, but it looks a bit cheap compared to some other collections that I have previously purchased from WB.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Pretty cute movie. My kids loved it (when my kids love something and it keeps them distracted then mom and dad love it). I liked it, silly movie with a good &#34;family values&#34; storyline in there. Not normally a huge fan of the Cage, but I think I was able to get onboard with him in this movie. I would definitely recommend this movie if you're looking for a good family night flick. Heck, I would watch it without the kids to be honest.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|HD Pro version provides much more useful information about battery condition than the free version and accurate info on current charge.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Great movie for the family. We all love this movie and we watch it all the time. We get a kick out of the minions but the story is great and heart-warming.
B00BRUPICM|4.0|Riveting book. By the end though, it seems like a soap opera that has gone too far. Will keep you on the edge of your seat, and leave you saying \\"really?\\"
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't think this really deserves much of an explanation. Facebook - it is cool to stay connected with friends and family, but this thing eats up real social interaction and real life in general.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Really is a fun game. It presents numerous puzzles that are neither too easy or too hard, providing an excellent casual gaming adventure experience.<br /><br />Pro: Great music, intriguing story, excellent graphics, fun puzzles, intuitive interface, good flow.<br /><br />Con: Too short! I spent a few hours playing it over the course of a few days, had a great time, but I want more!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A wonderful insight into the life of an american hero.  Always wondered what it would be like to be in the shoes of a true military hero and this book did just that.  You got the good with the bad - a great eye opener.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|An endearing story with likeable characters, a good far fetched yarn with a nice outcome. I think it would appeal to a great many keen readers wanting something new.
0307454568|5.0|Love this series!!  I couldn't put it down and had to keep reading!!  You must read this series!!!  I was sad to learn that author had passed away and there will be no more books!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing.<br />The 'exercises' really work and I learned a lot.<br />It's also written with a great dose of humor.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great app  and so easy to use on the Kindle Fire HD. I highly recommend for users of the Kindle.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|WOW. that's all I can say when an almost 800 page book holds my interest for that long!<br />It kept sucking me back in and I couldn't wait to pick up where I left off the day before.<br />So many really neat insights but the writer. Really moving and interesting.
1451666179|4.0|I kind of feel like a d-bag using the term \\"laugh out loud funny\\" in a review - or any kind of everyday conversation, for that matter - but HYPERBOLE AND A HALF is just that. Several times I got to laughing so hard that one or more of my dogs fled the room in fear and confusion. Whether reliving especially bizarre and embarrassing childhood memories (my mother will be relieved to know that I was not the only ten-year-old to run around on all fours, lapping water from bowls, pretending to be a leopard or a horse or a slobbering German Shepherd), or trying to reassure her neurotic rescue dog (see: the previous sentence), Brosh's stories are consistently hilarious, not a little heartbreaking, and totally relatable. In an interview I caught online, Brosh said that she draws herself as a lumpy, weird-looking little creature because that's how she sees herself. I know the feels.<br /><br />Fans of the web comic may wonder whether they really need to buy this book. Rest assured: YOU NEED THIS BOOK. If you don't buy it, at least borrow it from the library (have fun waiting out the queue!). With a mix of previously published (\\"The Party,\\" \\"The God of Cake,\\" \\"Depression\\" Parts One and Two) and new material (\\"The Hot Sauce Debacle,\\" \\"Lost in the Woods,\\" \\"Identity\\" Parts One and Two), you don't want to miss out. Plus, you kind of have to love a book whose dedication page reads \\"For Scott. What now, f%$#^r?\\" And the chapters are even color-coded, yo! This is easily one of the soundest buying decisions I made in 2013.<br /><br />Not sure what to get your potty-mouthed introvert of a cousin this holiday season? Unlike the writhing mass of anxiety and self-loathing that forms the heart of this book, HYPERBOLE AND A HALF will easily fit inside an x-mas stocking. Bonus points if it's paw-shaped.<br /><br />As much as I adore it, I'm giving HYPERBOLE AND A HALF four stars instead of the full five because the author uses the r-word to refer to \\"the simple dog.\\" Not cool.
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|I purchased this for my Granddaughters to learn, they quickly learned all the states and now is onto the capitals and countries.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I never fail to be entertained by the King. I loved the shining reference.  and to see how Danny grew up.
B002QUWYWE|5.0|One of my favorites!  Had to rent it so my kids could see it now that they are old enough. Great acting and good story!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I'm enjoying this game very much. I love the fun scenery and levels. Haven't stopped playing yet. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|I watched this with my adult son (who I had to guilt into watching with me). Well, he ended up laughing and enjoying the movie and periodically kept saying – Oh my god, that’s you! Which is what makes this movie work. I am sure many mothers and sons will see themselves in the characters of Joyce and Andy. Streisand and Rogen had that chemistry on screen that was believable and simply magical. It followed a romantic comedy plotline which was tailored for a mother-son relationship. A very sweet, funny, and touching movie.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I've loved this story since reading it in Jr. High. It was one of the first books I bought when I got a Kindle & I've read it & it's sequels numerous times :)
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It's all about Benedict Cumberbatch in this latest Star Trek installment. His fascinating portrayal of Khan stole the show, even from the bromance between Kirk and Spock. Every character got their chance in the spotlight in this one. There is something to please diehards (tribbles!) and new fans. Except for the utterly gratuitous underwear scene.  Really?  Really?
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Crashes every time I open to play it! And then I lose that life.  Guess I have to keep playing on my phone :(
B0063GORYU|4.0|Play with caution!  So much fast paced fun can be addictive. You can spend hours playing before you know it.
B000JML7EC|4.0|This book is definitely a classic that every on should read. Although it is confusing at points there is a lot of symbolism
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Great fun.  Good graphics and easy to play.  Would recommend this game to anyone .  Extremely easy to use and understand.
B008XCM18Q|4.0|INITIAL REVIEW<br />Had already read the story in &#34;dead tree&#34; format. I am continuing to replace stories I have read before by the ebook copy whenever I have the cash and the opportunity to do so.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|When the scoring numbers pop up they are so small and hard to notice it makes it hard to judge some of the plays.  Just something the game needs to update.  Great game otherwise as I have played it many times on a table for years.  This digital version plays well and is hard to stop once you start.
B00BC254I8|5.0|This was one AMAZING book! Mike Tyson is a tragic figure that you cannot help but feel for. He has been through such a journey in this life and I wish him all the best.
B00FLML7HW|4.0|i have bought this item and it is a great buy, the images and the clarity make this collection a must have for any film collector
B008JDAC7G|1.0|As others have stated, there are very suspicious permissions required for this app. I would rather be safe than sorry.
B00KR6332Y|4.0|I had not heard of the new A Cappella group, 'Pentatonix' until I saw and heard their new youtube version of 'Carol Of The Bells'. It was such a terrific sound that I purchased their new digital Christmas songs, 'PTXmas'. Their sounds are glorious and so vibrant.<br /><br />The group won a recording contract in a contest on a television show. They are from Texas, and have now hit the big time. The group members are, Scott Hoying , Mitch Grassi , Kirstie Maldonado , vocal bass Avi Kaplan and beat boxer Kevin “K.O.” Olusola. This new Christmas sound has quickly become a holiday favorite. The tunes are:<br /><br />Angels We Have Heard on High<br />O Come, O Come Emmanuel<br />Carol of the Bells<br />The Christmas Song<br />O Holy Night<br />This Christmas<br /><br />Each song brings the feeling and the group's version of Christmas. It is uplifting and inspiring, and the true meaning of Christmas comes through.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 12-05-13
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Typical Grisham book!  Very entertaining and suspenseful. Highly recommend. One of those books you can't put down. Ending always in doubt.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I enjoyed the book overall, but not as much as Hosseini's previous novels. I found it a little tedious & confusing, hard to keep track which character was narrating each chapter.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Setup was not completely straightforward for me. Happily, Google answered its customer service line quickly, although I only batted .500 on getting a rep that was actually useful. (Tip: your wireless network can't be hidden.)<br /><br />As far as the device itself goes, streaming with one of the &#34;apps&#34; (Netflix, HBO, Youtube, Google Play) works pretty well, but the &#34;tab casting&#34; is so laggy as to be worthless. If you are interested in streaming things besides the supported apps, you will still need to keep your HDMI cable around.
0891419063|5.0|The author, E B Sledge, went through the most unimaginable war experiences and was able to capture it in words from his personal diary and form it into a book which is very hard to put down, and to do all this without using any explicit words.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Enjoyed this book and it has changed the way I eat (most of the time). I have encouraged lots of people to read this book, I see a lot of conditions that I think could be helped by avoiding wheat products.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Loved the UI! The status bar disappears giving you a full screen. The graphics are simple yet good. I dont think this game could be any better! Loved it!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is totally worth reading. The middle is a little dry but it's still an overall a great book. I definitely did not see the ending coming!!!!!!!! Must read Divergent and Insurgent before this or else you will be a little lost.
B000URWYTS|5.0|This was a well written novel.  I found it hard to believe that I did not know any of this history of Frank Lloyd Wright.  Everyone has heard of the St. Valentines Day Massacre, the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, Bonnie and Clyde, etc.  These were horrific events, but so was this part of Frank Lloyd Wright's history.  It is a story of consequences and the ultimate price to pay for loving someone.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to use, adds new life to my old LCD 40''TV and the price is amazing. For some reason Youtube looks better than in my PC and videos load faster
B007IXWL2C|5.0|hope el hurrys up and writes some more. when you pick it up you can't put it down so beware
B00594XOZU|5.0|It was worth the wait!!! Kik messenger is back and its even better!! Now let's you log in and make a new account. Highly recommended . Sends things fast and you get replay right after there sent. Get get get!!!!!
B0043X1FOK|5.0|My mother loves this film and I can see why, it really is funny and charming! A little sad as well, but with a happy ending.
B00969PR18|5.0|Great online map app. I spent the extra $ to buy the US offline map set and chose to download only two states, CA and OR, to save space on my kindle; this makes the entire app worth while. I love the &quot;favorites&quot; feature - it allows me to save locations and easily create routes for trips that I take. I've tried other top map apps, maybe the smoothness and simplicity is what I favor most with ForeverMap!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This was different from the original Judge Dredd, but held its own.  The story line differred but was setup properly.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is ok I love the game candy crush but when I want to update candy crush it can't update when I want it to
B00A81MV3U|3.0|I came to this with misgivings - on the whole I think Americans do not do movies or TV shows about mental illness at all well.<br /><br />This film in particular was really not that original - remember AS GOOD AS IT GETS with Nicholson, Hunt, Kinnear, Gooding Jr.?<br /><br />I thought the actual standout performance was from Bradley Cooper rather than Jennifer Lawrence, although I admit Ms Lawrence was for me nearly as good, I thought Cooper was the outstanding actor.<br /><br />De Niro does some of his best work in many years and really nails his character, as does Australian actress (Yes!) Jackie Weaver.<br /><br />At its heart, the film is, surprise surprise, a bit of a fable, a bit of candy floss, with a fairy-tale ending.<br /><br />It was a bit weird to see Lucky Thompson's brother from Boardwalk Empire turn up as Cooper's brother - that was a bit of a clanger for me. Great actor - wrong role to cast him in.<br /><br />I thought the film was a mite simplistic and really didn't go into any great detail about anything.<br /><br />After watching it, I do not entirely understand why Lawrence got her Oscar for her role in the film. I cannot now remember any of the other contenders, but I didn't think she got as much under the skin of her character the way Cooper was able to.<br /><br />Obviously, that is just my personal opinion. The Oscars were handed out and Lawrence is riding a well-deserved wave to super-stardom - I don't wish to detract from that one iota.<br /><br />I guess I would have liked to see these same two leads tackle the story with a denser script when they are perhaps 10-15 years older.<br /><br />It has some beautifully achieved moments and has a lot of serious things to say without slapping you between the eyes with a dead fish to get the message across.<br /><br />It is also tragic in parts and at its heart the film is about the fracture lines that may evolve in human lives but also what might come along.<br /><br />For me the main message was to persevere, and that where one may be falling it takes another, and usually more than one, usually family, to help.<br /><br />In a nutshell, unconditional love.<br /><br />I didn't give it 4 stars (just missed out) as I didn't think it entirely warranted such a rating, but it still has much to say and the performances are all solid.<br /><br />Maybe for me it was the storyline/screenplay that underwhelmed me a little - I felt I'd seen it all before. But don't let me stop you.<br /><br />Well worth a viewing (box of tissues on hand, ladies - and some of us guys too!)
B004PGO25O|5.0|Steven pulls himself through his failures and drags us, kicking and screaming towards that which we most dread...the success of our innermost selves.
B006T3RM08|1.0|TrackPad gets stuck in the down (clicked) position. Should have read the reviews instead of watching a single YouTube review. Company clearly doesn't care because 1. Who the hell ships a product with this glaring issue. 2. If they didn't know about it with the first production, they sure know about it now and have still made no change. This is the result when companies don't care.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Great drama/mystery. Characters were rich as well as you felt like one of the community watching the tragic event.  Many times I had tears streaming because you felt the pain and love.
157421327X|5.0|Super book for teachers who want to give students think time.  Or down time.. Let your brain float time.. Well put together and illustrated.
B00F880BWG|5.0|OMG The mid-season finale once again proved no one is sacred! Just when you thought Rick and his &#34;family&#34; were safe, all hell breaks loose and everyone is running scared for their survival. I like the uncertainty coupled with the explosive upheavals, the producers keep the viewers never knowing what will happen next. Just when you thought television was unimaginative, along comes this show. Fantastic!
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Too much substance abuse, nudity, and bad language.  Main character kept going from bad to worse in his use of illegal drugs and alcohol and the movie wanted us to sympathize with him.
B006SAR6P8|1.0|The movie is fine but amazon wants me to rate it even before they even shipped the movie. The movie is 5 stars but I'm subtracting 4 for failure to ship the movie.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|When I open any app and the first thing they want is my email address or &#34;login with facebook&#34;, I don't need it. I canned it from my tablet & got the free Bingo for the Kindle instead.
B000002KZ6|5.0|Everyone has their favorite Talking Heads album, and for me it is \\"Speaking In Tongues\\". I happened to listen to it again start to finish just yesterday evening, and then realized that this year marks the 30th anniversary of that album's release.<br /><br />\\"Speaking In Tongues\\" (9 tracks; 47 min.) is bookended by its best-known songs, which also happened to be the singles from the album and, while we're at it., for me also the weakest, or perhaps more correctly the least interesting tracks on the album: the album opener is \\"Burning Down the House\\", the band's only US Top 10 single ever, and the song that really propelled this album. The album closer is \\"This Must be The Place (Naïve Melody)\\", which I loved when it first came out, but now I just don't care about anymore. In between those two, though, there are 7 mammoth songs that are all just stellar, one better than the other. Starting with \\"Making Flippy Floppy\\", David Byrne and his band mates brings heavily grooved and even funky sounds that I found impossible to resist then, and still do now, 30 years later. Check out the instrumental outro! Then marvel at \\"Girlfriend Is Better\\", in which Byrne pleads \\"stop making sense!\\" time and again, with another delicious instrumental outro. Yessir! The other things that was striking when this album first was released, is that it seemed the band was actually having fun! Imagine that, after the oh-so serious albums that were \\"Remain In Light\\" and \\"Fear of Music\\". Rather than fear, Talking Heads EMBRACE the music on \\"Speaking In Tongues\\". \\"Moon Rocks\\" and \\"Pull Up The Roots\\" are the two often forgotten/overlooked songs on this album, and I encourage you to play them again, I think you will be amazed how good they sound.<br /><br />I had the great fortune of seeing Talking Heads in concert on the \\"Stop Making Sense\\" tour in the Fall of 1983, at the Smith Center on the GW campus in Washington DC. To this day it remains one of the most memorable concerts I have seen in my life time, and I've seen hundreds of them. That aside, it just blows the mind that it's been 30 years since \\"Speaking In Tongues\\" was released. It sounds as fresh today as it did then, and it truly stands the test of time. \\"Speaking In Tongues\\" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!time, and I've seen hundreds of them. That aside, it just blows the mind that it's been 30 years since \\"Speaking In Tongues\\" was released.

0385474547|5.0|It was the book I wanted and it was in perfect condition.<br />Oh, and if you're not reading this for an English assignment, you should like it. It was actually a decent read.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|So one day I'm listening to &#34;Fade Into You&#34; on the radio and I was thinking to myself, damn, Mazzy Star really seemed to disappear after that.  Looked them up and found that Seasons Of Your Day was released, so I picked it up right away.<br /><br />There are those who will complain that this is &#34;more of the same&#34; from them, but in my mind that is the reason I still listen to &#34;So Tonight...&#34; after all these years, and it's great to have a new release from them.<br /><br />Loved the new release from the first listen through, and like the last album, sounds even better in headphones.  Definitely a &#34;must buy&#34; for fans of &#34;Fade Into You&#34;.
0670026557|5.0|Amazing read and so many concepts to utilize throughout life! LOVED IT! Truly inspirational and motivational.  I recommend for anyone trying to improve their life.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE ME And My Wife Like That movie We Watch It Everyday We Never Get Tire Of It.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I started watching the ABC Family version of Pretty Little Liar. I had no idea it was a book until my 11 year old cousin said so. I bought this book because I believe that the books are always more informative than the shows. It's only so much drama you can put into 60 minutes of network tv. In reading the book, I have one word: Scandalous.
B009CPGZFS|5.0|Suspense and drama are definitely the way to describe this episode.  The interactions between characters plus the plot made for an excellent episode of this series.
B00GMONG90|4.0|PTX, Vol. 2 far surpasses its predecessor (PTX, Vol. 1) in terms of song choice, arrangements, and sound quality.<br /><br />1) The album starts off with a bang, leading with their insanely popular and catchy cover of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis's &#34;Can't Hold Us&#34;. Driving beats, convincing raps with attitude, and a ridiculous amount of energy launches you into the next track.<br /><br />2) &#34;Natural Disaster&#34; is an original, which flies on the strength of lead singer Scott Hoying's rifftastic solo and a clean, strong supporting background.  It's a foot-stomper, almost literally, with the percussion driving the song and reflecting the unavoidable, destructive nature of the subject matter.<br /><br />3) &#34;Love Again&#34; is, I believe, another original track, with Mitch Grassi at the helm.  Mitch has one of the most beautiful voices in existence, soaring effortlessly into the higher registers with a delicacy and confidence that underlines the chorus brilliantly.<br /><br />4) &#34;Valentine&#34; is one of my favorite tracks on the album. A cover of Jessie Ware's original, the introduction is absolutely fascinating and haunting.  All three members of the trio show a remarkable amount of restraint in this delicate cover, backed by Kevin Olusola's understated vocal percussion and Avi Kaplan's steady bass. The song dances along almost flirtatiously, with the solo seguing beautifully between Mitch and Scott.<br /><br />5) &#34;Hey Momma/Hit the Road Jack&#34; is cheeky, upbeat, and apparently a mix of an original song and a classic. The &#34;Hey Momma&#34; portion reminds me of their tracks from Vol. 1, particularly &#34;The Baddest Girl&#34; and &#34;Show You How to Love&#34;, with the &#34;Hit the Road Jack&#34; parts throwing the listener into the past.  Make sure your bass is up - Avi's bassline in the choruses is delightful.  Kirstie Maldonado lends a bit of insouciant, sexy flair here and there, interplaying with Scott's solo perfectly.<br /><br />6) &#34;I Need Your Love&#34; is a cover of Calvin Harris feat. Ellie Goulding's top 40 hit.  I much prefer the cover to the original, but that generally happens with every PTX cover. :) I love the choruses, but my favorite part is the stunningly simple ending, with Avi taking over the solo with his beautifully cultured and sensitive voice.<br /><br />7) &#34;Run To You&#34; is, in my opinion, the absolute highlight of the entire album. A choral ballad, all five members of the group sing, without the energy-driving beats or percussive hits of their pop hits.  The song leaves you feeling emptied and full of something ephemeral.  This song ripples through you and settles deep into your bones, with the bridge launching you into a yearning hope, before the denouement gently brings you back down. A masterpiece, and quite possibly the best original PTX has penned to date.  If you're part of a musical group and interested in singing it, they're offering the sheet music for free on their website, PTXOfficial.com.<br /><br />8) &#34;Daft Punk&#34; is their famous medley of the electronic duo's most popular hits. All of the members of the group get their moment in the spotlight in a brilliant arrangement that plays between and overlays the songs just...brilliantly. I'm running out of descriptive words. This cover is fantastic.<br /><br />9) Swedish House Mafia mash-up &#34;Don't You Worry Child/Save the World&#34;. The only reason I'm giving this album 4 stars instead of 5 - the Amazon MP3 album version of PTX, Vol. 2 does NOT actually include this 9th track!  Reviews that mention this song must have the iTunes version of the track, as I believe it's an iTunes exclusive. The song is available for listening on YouTube but is NOT included in your digital copy of the album. I did not realize that there was this secret 9th album-only track for iTunes users prior to purchase, so I figured I should warn any other listeners who might be disappointed by this incredible cover's absence.  Definitely give it a listen - their cover of these two EDM hits has rendered me unable to listen to the originals without expecting them to go together. Love this cover, but must resort to listening to it on YouTube for now.<br /><br />Highlights: Run To You, Valentine, Daft Punk. A must get. Album rating: 5/5!
B0014VQGX4|5.0|We have TEN Bruder construction toys so this review is going to show up in all ten places. These are all very well made with extreme attention to detail. They are made of plastic and of course could be broken but they have a smart design and are reasonably durable. The mirrors on the Mack dump truck are probably the weakest item, but if they were to break off the truck would be otherwise functional. Toys break.<br /><br />We have the cement truck, skid steer loader, log truck, mack truck, tractor trailer with bulldozer, backhoe, two different types of excavators, an articulating front end loader, fire engine, and something called a tele-extender.<br /><br />These all have so much intriguing detail that the kids are immediately drawn to them.  They all have moving parts that allow them to perform their real world functions. There are detents built in to hold position, so for example with the bulldozer, backhoe and front loader, the blades can be fixed and held in several different positions.<br /><br />As far as toys go, these are expensive but even a three year old understands from the detail that these are different that the coarser, simpler $20 equivalents. These clearly look like the &#34;real&#34; things.<br /><br />We've all had a lot of fun with these.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is an entertaining game and challenging to play without making you want to pull your hair out. They must have removed the annoying feature that begs for reviews because I have been playing it on Kindle Fire and it hasn't asked me for that yet. I would have to recommend this game for its nice interface and design. It's not timed so it's relaxing to play.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|I had no problems with loading or playing this game on my first gen kindle. It is a fun game that can get addicting as you try to best yourself. it took me a bit to get the hang of flicking the ball - especially without hurting my finger!!! when I left the game there was no problem with it running in the background (it closed properly unlike reviewer that said it did not) I can see my hubby spending many hours playing this one :) try this one out while it's the faotd - you might find you like it like I did!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|The emotions of the characters affected me. I can visualize many scenes even now. The title makes sense afterwards. It 's a quick read.
B00G32OER4|4.0|I don't scare easily but this one made me jump a few times. I would recommend it to folks who like scary not gross movies.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A well written book. Fast paced, well written characters. Look forward to reading the rest of the three books in this series.
B00B5HQL50|4.0|Skyfall Review<br />Disappointed in the performances. The villain was unbelievable  to take a for instance that they do not show Bond discovering how the villain got away.  The new Q didn't come off as believable--but in general the storyline was very good and I can't wait to see the next picture with the new M.  I still think this is worth watching.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This is the best science fiction film in decades.  It is a thinking persons film, it is deeply philosophical, it has great special effects used for a  great purpose. There is nearly no violence and it is about profound ideas, not dumb shows and noise as Shakespeare would call what the commoners require for entertainment.
159413586X|5.0|A new subject matter, of couse!  A novel idea in a novel!  The trilogy is much better than the first movie, we'll see how well the second movie works.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|An excellent series! In today's TV program choices (many have the substance of 3rd grade potty humor, near nudity, or worse), Downton is refreshingly interesting and well presented. Thank you PBS for bringing quality to the viewers.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT APP THAT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES. It is easy to use frees up space and even if you are not a tech savvy person it allows you to free space without the fear of deleting something you may regret. So if you are looking for a way to clean up some junk files and speed up your device I suggest this app.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is so awesome . It works so well on my kindle fire HD :) I love the new update !!! :D it's worth downloading it people !!!:D
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Just a great movie. Put together very well. Not to long. Just right. The ending is kind of sad. Eastwood is a great actor.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a great time killer. You won't even realize  hours have gone by until you look up and you see no daylight left..sooo addictive!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a excellent basic calculation. Actually much easier than using a physical calculator. Have seen no down side to it ultility.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Like any middle book of a trilogy, Catching Fire was somewhat slower than the first volume.  I loved the plot twists and the continued love story confusion which Katniss exhibits in regard to Peeta and Gale. This book certainly drives you quickly toward The Mocking Jay.
