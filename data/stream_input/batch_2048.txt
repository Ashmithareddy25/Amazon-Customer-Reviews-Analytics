B0098VYCCE|1.0|The movie was bland and predictable, below average at best, but that's not why I gave it only one star. This movie must have been interrupted about 15 or 20 times to buffer, usually lasting from 5 to 30 seconds. I cannot believe that I paid good money to be constantly interrupted and annoyed. My wife and I were so exhausted of watching it that by the end we were laughing about the whole thing. I was actually considering purchasing Amazon Prime since I use Amazon for other purchases, but, after this, I wonder who actually pays for this garbage. It might work for someone out there, but I've heard a lot of problems with Amazon's Instant Video streaming service due to buffering issues. I'll just stick to Netflix. I have had zero problems streaming HD from them. My internet speed is 15 mbps and every other service I use works fine.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it was really fun until it stoped working and wouldn't open, but other wise I would recomend it. its really cool!
B000HZM4FW|5.0|Chinatown, Godfather 1 & 2, and Network are not only the best movies of the 1970s...I think they're the best of all time.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I sleep so much better since I began using it. I think it's wonderful that it has an alarm feature.
1616284382|5.0|The book was exquisitely beautiful, and rather large. It would serve well as a coffee table book, as it is about that size and is also rather thick. The artwork is stunningly reproduced in high quality printings. The story of how the film came to be is also riveting, though you get easily distracted by the art. Bought this as a gift and almost considered keeping it for myself.
B00422LESO|4.0|It's been awhile since I've lost myself in the pages of a romantic tale, but Austenland gripped me tight and didn't let go until I reached the last page. It was a wonderful jaunt into a fantasy I've entertained on more than one occasion. For any fan of Jane Austen or a fan of Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy, this is a must read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 5 year old Grandson plays the first Temple Run and when I told him there is a Temple Run 2 his eyes lit up and he waited patiently while it downloaded!  He loves this game and the hand eye coordination is wonderful for him!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Continues in the tradition of his previous novels (Pillars of the Earth, World Without End, A Dangerous Fortune).  Interesting and colorful characters who bring the relevant historical periods to life.  The length of each of these books is sufficient to really delve into the background as well as fully develop the characters. I love the historical perspective to his novels and look forward to reading Books Two and Three.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|It brought back so many memories of my first love, however, the male teen character had the maturity of a 50 year old which made the story, to me, so unrealistic.  Teenage boys just are never that mature.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I really like this series. It is light yet it keeps your interest. I would recommend it to anyone. Great!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Excellent.  Kept our family on the edge of our seats!  The acting by our long time favorites as well as some newcomers to us, was brilliant.  We live in Charlotte NC which made it fun picking out the surrounds filmed here!
1930485182|5.0|This is one of the best yoga books out there and the best book I have found on asana (physical practice).  I love this book even though I have no issues with my cycle.  The descriptions are excellent but the clear, beautiful illustrations really set this book apart.  They are somehow easier to digest than photographs.  I am a yoga teacher and this book has helped me into poses that were previously unavailable to me.  I also appreciate its emphasis on safety.  I would recommend this book to anyone, even those who don't menstruate (incl. men).
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Not much to it. It works. It's cheap. Done. If you need an extra cable to charge your kindle fire, this is the one to get.
1906735875|4.0|I collect comics and don't like reading them in fear of loosing the value, especially when it comes to an older series like the Judge Dredd Series. A little goofy at first then it starts to get really at some point, when reading you don't realize it. The story lines are short and sweet. It is a good pick up!
B005XN0SGU|5.0|I have a collection of CBR files that I'd been trying to view on my kindle fire... this app works beautifully. If I had only found it sooner.
0988262592|5.0|This is the most amazing IT book I have ever read. It was crowd sourced and influenced by hundreds of IT professionals, so it is not one person's opinion which is all too common. There is a clearly fictitious company, Parts Unlimited, but the \\"goings on\\" are so real life that anyone in the industry is going to relate to the plot and story. The idea of using fiction to teach IT/IT Security is a good one, though still rarely used. This way there is the potential for the ideas in the book to appeal to business unit managers outside of IT.  And the authors are to be commended for keeping the message approachable through \\"The Three Ways\\". Buy this book, read this book and then hand it to a senior manager in your organization. They may or may not read it, but the book makes a compelling case why they should.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Arrived as expected in good shape.  It has come in handy for several occasions.  A handy book to have on hand
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Great
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a really good, heartfelt book.  It's not just for teenagers.  I'm 37 and enjoyed it immensely.  I highly recommend it.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I'm always looking for time passing DVDs to fill in on snowy winter days. This set was a pleasing surprise. Fairy tales set in todays world. How would that come about you say? It's good story line with good vs evil without getting preachy. Every fairy tale you can think of has a great spin for the modern day viewer. Even my big he-man son liked the stories. We are looking forward to season two.
1401324649|4.0|This was my first time to hear of the author Jonas Jonasson.  The 100-year-old man who climbed out the window and disappeared is a quirky book which  tells the life story of the main character Alan Karlsson who comes from a remote area of Sweden. The book starts on the day of his 100th birthday just before his party is about to begin. The story weaves back to his early boyhood throughout his adults years and up to the present day. Alan has a knack for meeting a range of interesting characters in quite mundane situations. Alan's approach to life is about taking it easy and availing of opportunities as they arise. These opportunities take him around the world meeting criminals, communists, capitalists, hot dog stand owners. I loved his 'don't worry worry, 'till worry, worries you' approach to awkward situations. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I'll be meeting my book club friends soon and am sure we will have plenty to say about his various  adventures.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This an amazing game. It is very addictive and has really cool new features. I would say everyone should buy this game. This is a great new sequel to one of the best games.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|I loved this video when it was on VHS. so I needed to buy a new one for Blu Ray. Even better! There is an &#34;Intermission&#34; in the blu Ray version that is Hysterical! I watch this every year and really enjoy this version :)
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|The beginning set up of the movie was a bit long but the ending of this movie packs a punch.
B008A1NKTO|5.0|Great movie! It was part of a gift exchange during the Christmas season. There are parts of the movie that may be hard to view for some people.
B007549W62|1.0|This movie is a complete waste of time. Humans can be dark, but a real life scenario wouldn't play out like this. Everyone that didn't give this film one star is misguided or maybe follows Tom Cruise's religion. Idiotas.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|my two yr old loves this app great to entertain why I run errands.  keeps us both sane when I have to take her to the bank or license bureau<br />easy to use<br /><br />worth the money.  great app
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A very enjoyable app and a great brain teaser that gets harder as you play it. I love every minute of it!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I can`t believe how many times thus app has locked up and restarted on me.  Temple Run 1 had no problems like this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all 3 books. 50 Shades definitely keeps you interested, I found myself being pulled into this love story. I recommend this book to readers who love twists, turns, romance and whips.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|i love ebay sewing, shoes, books etc. i go into it lots of times during the day and just look at stuff
B0031Q0XCA|3.0|While unique is sometimes interesting and even enjoyable, I found this movie to be interesting but not particularly enjoyable or entertaining. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a very good actor and his subsequent movies bear that out he seems to me to be alomost disengaged in this role. If you want to see a quirky odd piece then you might like it, if quirky and odd is not what you are looking for, pass this one by.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is so graphic and amazingly epicly fun for all ages. a must get of all apps and games for devices
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I thought the book had a great start but wasn't quite what i hoped for as i continued to read on.  It definitely wasn't the worst book i've ever read but it was a great one either.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I am obsessed with SOA and when the 4th season came out I had to watch it! Unfortunately, this show can be pretty expensive to buy at the store. I bought this on instant upload for really cheap! Highly recommend, and the instant upload is a piece of cake!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is difference between waiting miserably in line and enjoying yourself immensely while you wait.  Even though it can be exhausting at times it is exciting when you win
B009EELBIS|5.0|Best movie of all time!  We enjoy it over and over.  Perfect for the holidays or any time you get a break and need inspiration!
B00A757EFW|5.0|It is fun and has me on my toes.  I go from screaming to being disappointed when the ghosts eat pacman.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this sequel!! Better than the original game and it is definitely addicting!! Totally giving it 5 stars (:
0810994739|5.0|Little brother loved it, and before I wrapped it I could tell it was a solid book. The printing quality is nice, and the hard cover means this book will last.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this book was fantastic. just as soon as I thought I had it all figured out she'd throw another curveball in and keep me guessing all over again.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I love Linkin Park, and this is a refreshing new album.<br /><br />The disc was brand new in the shrink wrap, untouched.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I have a massive crush on Colleen Hoover, her books are fantastic, her characters are so real, and the love they share is so sweet.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Brand new, un-opened, great condition, was a very good movie! if your a fan of batman you will like this movie
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really loved it. Another book I had to finish in one setting just because I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.
B009DKCBM8|5.0|what a recording neil and crazy horse came up with,the cd is good. but in blu-ray it will knock your socks off. there is a video for each song and the sound quality is tremendous. you must buy blu-ray because sound matters.
0316024597|1.0|After 12 pages in, I had to stop.  You'll hate this, unless you love stream of consciousness books like James Joyce.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|dowton abbey my wife and i loved it.excellent storylines and actors,plus many bonus features you will love.great purchase for this wonderful program
B003Y2XI8W|4.0|pretty good cd, and pretty good songs, like it something different to listen to and relax or work out to
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest.  A bunch.  I got this app for my new Kindle fire.  I already have it bookmarked on my computer, and I have the app on my iPhone.  Now I'm covered.  What more can I say.....;-)
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|she has a very unique voice, it just captures you and you can't help but be engrossed in her songs
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really enjoyed both Season 1 and 2.  I like English history and it was fun watching this. It's addicting.
B0018QQQK8|2.0|This book was a snooze. I had a hard time connecting with the characters and the writing was not compelling. I found it to be stiff and lackluster.
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|This movie is supposed to an action movie with lots of big guns causing ultra-violence. However, it doesn't take that much effort to write a plot and choreographic action scenes that make sense.  It was like watching a mock up on the history channel show Top Guns.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The books start off slow for a few chapters but then it pulls you right in, it has a lot going on.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|awesome game!!!<br /><br />much better than the first one.. good update..<br />and happy that its free!!!.. and I think that's it
B005D0RDKW|1.0|I only have a 2-channel system (a really, really good 2-channel system though)so I can only comment on the Dolby 2.0 sound; the worst sounding blu-ray I have ever heard. The sound was distant, almost like it had a muted quality to it. I'll probably never watch/listen to this DVD again; I cannot recommend it's purchase to anyone with a decent system that cares about sound quality.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was such a detail story, I absolutely loved the story from it being sad, intense, heart breaking and so surreal in many ways of real life!
B00285K1KE|5.0|much better than that stupid 2008 the incredible hulk iron man and the dark knight rises those three films are god awful the hulk and daredevil > incredible hulk and iron man
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a great book, I couldn't put it down, read it in 3 hours!!! I'd like to have more like it!
B004I744AS|5.0|It has almost every word. and for Doctor Who fans the definition from the shows!!! that way if you don't have a clue what its talking about you can look it up!
0525953728|5.0|after reading this book,inow have a better idea of what really happened to OBL! the news just makes stuff up to try and get any story out first.i lent this book to my bro.in law,and he really liked it too.
B00006ADGP|1.0|So not worth it. A very poor quality. Not to mention its dubbed over in English. Looks like it was copied from VHS.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid kids made me download it it is going going going going going going going
B005I6EU7U|4.0|At first glance, this appears to be an elegant folio cover for tablets; it has an authentic-looking antique book design with embossing on the faux leather, some \\"gold\\" leafing, and real top-stitching, and it fits nicely on a book shelf (great disguise if you think you need to hide your device for whatever reason). While the design is lovely and the black microfiber supposedly prevents your screen from getting scratched, the way the tablet is held in is by four elastic straps that do an ok job, but I feel in time will wear out. Because of that concern, the design gets 4/5 stars<br /><br />The function of this folio is to give the tablet a different look and ease of portability without fear of it breaking. It also helps serve as a dust cover for those who have tablets that don't always use them. This is not made for all terrain, though it's good and light weight enough for public transport. Parks and other minor recreational places are ok. I wouldn't take this folio camping or to the beach do to fear of destroying both the folio and tablet.  Even though there is a cover there is a minor opening that doesn't really stay closed with the tablet in it. This folio doesn't really appear to protect a tablet from accidental drops. For every day use, this gets a 3.5/5, and for not-so every day use (rougher environments), it's closer to 1/5, so bear that in mind when deciding what case to buy.<br /><br />The positive thing about this folio is that it fits most 7.1 inch tablets  It did fit the Galaxy Tab 7.1 and the original kindle with keyboard. I would recommend an accessories pack to go along with the folio, since screen protector is a must!  Over all for a folio I would give it 3.5/5 rounded up to 4. While is is beautiful, it only keeps to the basics of what a tablet user needs.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|hate it don't know what all the fuss is about this stupid game no rhyme or reason to it just something for kids to occupy themselves with
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's frustrating and annoying at times, but just like Temple Run you can't play this game enough! Love Love Love it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the most fun ever. we put a board together for the baby shower and everyone added items. This site will be around a long time.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is an awesome addition to my Kindle Fire HD. I can D/L all my music and listen to it on my Kindle from this one app! Love it!<br /><br /> Jenn ;)
B005I6EU7U|4.0|Overall a nice cover with a great book-feel appeal. Looks great on a shelf or anywhere else. Happy with this purchase.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Who doesn't love pinterest! This is a perfect Kindle App! Love that I can look up cute hairstyles on my kindle and then set it up to view while I'm doing my girls' hair!<br /><br />Jenn ;)
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I love the cd, only drawback is that it doesn't include &#34;Fade into You&#34; as advertised. I would love having a CD with the other songs from the show, full versions, not just snippets.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|If you like to play Bingo and need something to waste your time this is it. When you run out of B's or whatever though you have to wait to play and that just annoys me because I'm not PAYING to play a free game.<br /><br />Jenn ;)
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I looked at other cases for the kindle fire hd 7in  and this one by far looked the best to me, i got it and installed the kindle in just fine, it will not fall out of case it is nice
B003YUWLQE|3.0|It can get sweaty in the summer but overall comfortable!<br />I enjoyed the shoes for the first week. But that is all it took with normal wear for half of the black line to fall off.<br />It only happened to the right side shoe so it could be just a defective unit.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Worst Link Park album I've ever heard, ever.  Do not buy this CD if yo uare a fan of 'old school' Linkin Park.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|I would give this zero stars if the format allowed it.  Absolutely the WORST thing I've read in a long time--I'm sorry I wasted my time finishing it, but I kept thinking it MUST get better. It didn't, and for the following reasons:  NO character development except that I'm pretty sure that the lead female character is an absolute idiot,  NO insight into relationships, a &#34;plot&#34;, such as it was,  that made no sense whatsoever.  Avoid this book and any further books in this series like the plague.  You'll not get your money's worth even if you get if for free.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Live being able to shop based on the wish list.  She was excited to get this one!  She says it's great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Play minecraft hunger games constantly. Built huge fortress awesome app if you ask me. All the complainers play it on phones. So don't get it on a phone
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Beautiful movie and storyline! Our granddaughter loved it and we did too!<br />It has become one of her favorite movies!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works great. Nice to know how much battery life you have left for different  functions. Who tell others to get app.
1433210428|5.0|Concentration camps are heavy material, but through his experiences, certain undeniable truths about man's nature emerge.<br />Many lessons can be learned by reading this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app Is so cool all my friends have it and they love it and I love it too this app Is the best app ever so I rate it five stars
B000006RHR|5.0|One of Iron Maiden's best, in my opinion.  Powerful, melodic, and epic.  A definite must-have for any Iron Maiden Fan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It is a great follow up of the first book. If you like suspense this is the book to read
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is a really good book. The best one I have ever read.<br />You should read this book it is really good.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I've hade this game for about a month,and u could chat and ask  questions to people.and all of a sudden it said you have to be a member of Facebook to chat! I'm not in pressed!<br /> But I would recommend this game to people who have a Facebook page!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I used to love this game, and I always thought that it was addicting. Until now. whenever I try to open this game, it always shuts down. Even when I delete it and install it again, it does the same problem. Fix this and get 4 more stars.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I enjoyed the book but I was terribly disappointed that at the end Pi and the tiger nevermore to see each other. Just as Pi was beginning to gain headway with the tiger they are separated.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I enjoyed the initial story line and how it developed. The hidden story kept me intrigued. The ending was less than inspiring. A big build up for bit of a let down. The final destination was a open end to the movie. The alien sequence at the end wasn't needed and confused other parts of the movie. I enjoyed the \\"who created us, where did we come from, what's the purpose of life. The wanting to live forever thought, was also a attention grabber. The intellectual aspects of storyline kept me engaged. The look of the movie and special affects were great too.  Overall in enjoyed the experience.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Nice but  kind of too much drama .Don't judge me,The movie was different ,but the book is way better that's what I think
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|Just started using this app for a quick morning workout. Good exercises to get going. Quick 5 minute option to warm up or combine 2 small workouts(arm/abs-etc.)
1449410243|4.0|It was OK but not aas funny as I would have liked. I guess it is a matter of taste
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am 100% addicted to Pinterest!!!! Love the random pics....have tried tons of the recipes and crafts!! Every day I laugh at all the funny ECards!!! Great entertainment!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I remember watching this series on PBS years and years ago.  There were scenes that I remembered years later and laughed about.  When I ordered it, it was like going back all those years.  It is the English dry humor and they are all funny.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Reading this book was a struggle.  I was alternately impatient and bored, yet paradoxically also compelled to keep reading.  I thought the real depth of the story was padded with a lot of British Cold War lessons and scene setting in MI5 bureaucratic incompetence. It was, however, the perfect setting for this story.<br /><br />The deeper threads of love & betrayal, loss of innocence, issues of trust, deception, and loss were the more compelling part for me.<br /><br />Thus it was alternately dull & intriguing, but ultimately worth the struggle for the deep and powerful ending.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I like these type of games. Keeps you engaged and tells a decent story. They suck you in by offerring the first few pieces for free and then charge 2.99 if you want to continue. Nice sales approach.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This may be one of the best animated movies we have seen in along time. The plot was good, characters well rounded, and the conclusion was somewhat unexpected.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Every time I read him, I find some original thoughts, which makes every reading worthwhile - originality is very scarce these days. Resilience is a great virtue, but Antifragile is better = original thought.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its fun and cute. kids and adults would love this game. it teaches them how to really care for a horse or any other animal
B005COO1X6|3.0|King is my favorite author.  This short is not his best. Left too much to the imagination and the reader just hanging,  Typical of his style.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|Gave this as a gift, because Pink Martini is our favorite group and we wanted to share this wonderful CD.  No one does Auld Lang Syne like Pink Martini.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book helped answer many many questions. Better still, it answered questions I never thought even ask LOL. I think it would be required reading for anyone looking to creating and submitting a book to Amazon.
B005M5OSBK|5.0|Pink Martini is one of our favorite groups, and we wanted this for a Christmas gift.  Receiver has become a big fan!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This is a fabulous series - I am not a huge fan of romance - but this series is so much more than that. Historical fiction, suspense , drama - laughter! and yes love - I cannot wait to read the next one-
1936891026|5.0|I am in a very similar situation as the author. Reading this book gives me courage to move on. Thanks for authoring this book!
B004EFYZ1C|2.0|Kinda cool - but if you have seen it once that is enough - but not that exciting.......rather a waste of space
B0086700CM|5.0|I have Temple Run installed on most, if not all of my portable electronic devices. The kids love it and entertains them on our many road trips.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|We all love these little angry birds - this is fun and different than the others - great little time waster.
B007H1HQW0|3.0|I have been too busy the last month or so with all the holidays and birthdays here that....Actually, i haven`t used it yet.........
B009MCRHH6|3.0|I loved the first 5 or so levels but now I am terribly stuck and can't progress - fun if you like really hard games.
B004TPXVKS|5.0|Absolutely a prog rock masterpiece. Fantastic extra content, including the DVD and the extra tracks. Recommended for all fans of Canterbury Scene.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is d bomb. It all sorts of stuff combined in one awesome app. Oh, and I cant believe it was free!<br />But I wish it had a game like dis where u go against someone or something like that. For now though its fine with me. Keep up the gooood work!!! I really mean that.
B004W4N55C|5.0|This app is amazing and very useful for any guitar player, casual or hardcore.  I very highly recommend it.  5 and a half stars!
0312380852|5.0|This book makes it very easy to understand the concept of macrame jewelry.<br />I love making jewelry, and after seeing it on pinterest, I knew I had to have a good<br />Book to illustrate the techniques of macrame.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Probably one of the best farmville-esk games I have ever played. Although it doesn't come close to Dead Trigger (another great game) it is still fun.
1594203334|4.0|I enjoyed reading it.  Bought it for my daughter.  Not sure what her feelings were.  Not sure if she had time to read it.
0062206281|5.0|This is the third book I've read by Zafon, the first being 'Shadow of the Wind,' and the second, 'The Angel's Game.' For me, I loved the former, but I just couldn't get into the latter.<br /><br />Anyhow, this book continues with the themes that were in 'Shadow of the Wind,' and though it has intrigue and mystery, it is by no means as complicated as 'Shadow of the Wind' is. Maybe this is why some of the reviewers here are referring to this as more of a short story.<br /><br />While it is possible to get through and enjoy this book without first reading the others, it might make for a richer experience to know the back-story on some of the people and places Zafon references in this one. This is especially true with character development and when our lead characters make a visit to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.<br /><br />This book flows well, and for the most part, Zafon stays on-task, without delving into obscure stories or circumstances. There are numerous twists and turns in the storyline, but how it all progresses and turns out is not predictable.<br /><br />The chapters are brief and so it makes for an easy read. Anyone familiar with Barcelona will have a mental map for some of the areas referenced, and the frequent trips to restaurants and cafes by our characters will have you pining for tapas and wine.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is definitely the best free horse game I've ever played...I wish there were more horses that didn't cost gems tho
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Prosaic plot, I know it. But the wolf scene was worth the cost of admission. If you love action, this one will not disappoint.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I am a big fan of the original broadway musical and was impressed my the thought and time that went into changing the music for film.  I don't think I ever fully understood the lyrics before I heard the film soundtrack.  True it is not to the caliber of the classically trained sound of the play, but I found the dialog through song all the more haunting.  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway were brilliant.  I love the way Samantha Barks adapted her sound for the film.  there are so many great musical moments...<br /><br />The reason I can only give 4 out of 5 stars is Russell Crowe.  He is just a little to nasally and I never feel like he lends anything extra to the songs he performs.  I am a big fan typically of his films, but I never felt he really understood and lived the life and music of Javert.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|The author still tells a good yarn and is able to find a new theme despite the large number of novels he has written.  I have read almost all of them and this rates with the rest.
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|Cast and crew is awesome but I was a bit whelmed by the story line. Ending was a bit disappointing.
B008Q09K2U|2.0|I have enjoyed the author's other books but this was long winded, and the attempts at humour left a great deal to be desired.  The action in the final chapters was very acceptable but the journey to get there was scarcely worth the reading time.  Compared with his earlier works this was a great disappointment.  Perhaps it is just me, but the the characters did not come alive and the humour seemed to be based on cheap shots and smart remarks which did not rate with this reader.

0316224588|5.0|Or at least that's how he seems to me.  I was so happy to return to his devilish and inspired company I am reading slowly to prolong the delight.  Rankin's prose is so masterful that even the excellent crime novels I have read recently (Talking to the Dead, Dark Winter) fade and I want to stay in Rebus-world forever.  Thanks Ian Rankin - more, please.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Typical romance with a twist this time.  Didn't require to much thought to realize that they would end up together.  The only question was what would split them up for the boy meets girl, boy loses girl formula.
0425252868|5.0|Once you have finished reading this book, you will know that there was. This expertly written book by Adam Makos tells the story of a combat encounter over Germany on 20 December 1943, by the crew of B-17F \\"Ye Olde Pub\\", piloted by Lt. Charlie Brown, and a Bf-109G being flown by Lt. Franz Stigler. The B-17F was a wreck after having been severely mauled by repeated attacks while on a bombing mission to attack an aircraft factory in Bremen - the rear gunner was killed and another gunner was severely wounded. Only one machine gun was serviceable, the plane had lost its left rear stabilizer and was flying on 3 engines, one sputtering. Then Stigler closed in on the bomber to finish it off, but no fire was coming from the bomber. I will not tell all the story here but Stigler saw how badly wounded were the crew and he let the bomber escape, flying for a while on her wingtip. Forty-six years later, Stigler and Brown finally met once again.<br /><br />The book tells the story of how Stigler became a pilot and his fighter pilot career with Jagdgeschwader 27 over North Africa and Sicily; then Brown's (and his crew's) story is told and that encounter on 20th December; then Stigler's story is resumed until the end of World War II, and his later life in Canada and, of course, of their emotional meeting almost 5 decades after Stigler decided not to shoot down Brown's bomber. It is a must and highly recommended.
034580404X|5.0|I know that everyone is calling these books &#34;porn&#34;, but if those people would actually READ them, maybe they would find out that it is based on a great storyline.  The characters are compelling.  The plot keeps you guessing, and of course, wanting more... of everything.

B00447L4KA|5.0|I had this when it originally came out on VHS, and it was one of those great movies that I had to go looking for on DVD.  Heath Ledger was just a great actor - this shows his comedic side, especially the scene in the bleachers when he sings to Julia Styles' character, Kat.  A must-buy for Ledger fans.
1451620829|2.0|I deeply regret reading this book.  I know that this is what biographies do, expose unknown sides of a person, but this one made me lose all the respect I ever had for Peter.  I had been a fan of \\"KISS\\" (their live music) since I was a kid, and although I knew Gene and Paul are not the greatest human beings I kinda liked Peter and Ace for that reason; and for not getting the credit deserved in the band; in the KISS empire.  But in restrospect we all know that Peter is the greatest drummer, but only in KISS.  As a musician Peter could never do anything good or decent out of KISS, as ACE did for example.  This book is full of complaints about the band, the management, about his wive's, about his teachers-everyone, about \\"only\\" making 10k and 25k per show on the reunion tours, about \\"wanting\\" to quit the band so many times, but staying just for the money.  After reading this book, I learned that he is not different than Gene and Paul.  Peter's biography reminded me of that of Vince Neil's from Motley Crue, not much brains, just another lucky egotist after the easy money and all material things you can obtain with it.  In his tales you can sense that losing something hurts him more than losing someone.  Peter thinks that the world needs to revolve around him and no one else.  I would not be surprised that the publishing of this book was a sad attempt to make a last quick buck. If you like Peter, don't read this book.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love to play video games and this one has me hooked.  I have learned that the faster you go, the more points you accrue which made me start all over again when I got to the end.  The go to game waiting for appointments, watching dinner not boil over, or any time you have a couple spare minutes to hours to waste.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Very readable and enjoyable, a culmination of Taleb's prior works, draws on history yet still very relevant to current events.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I can't say I laughed once while watching this movie, and I generally enjoy semi-crass popular comedies (for example: Get Him to the Greek, Team America, Tropic Thunder). The storyline was fairly predictable, but okay. As a twentysomething, non-Family Guy-fan, female, I am definitely not who this movie was trying to reach. My husband and brother-in-law got a kick out of it. Basically, if you are a male from the late 70s/early 80s, who likes Family Guy and LOVED Flash Gordon...this one is for you.
B005HSL626|5.0|My 3 year old Grandson LOVED this game. He plays it on my Kindle Fire. I would recommend this game for any young child learning all about technology!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have enjoyed the Dark Tower series, It, Salem's Lot, and The Stand to name a few of Mr. King's works, but this one outdoes them all. It is definitely a departure from the types of suspense books he has written before (I would hardly call any of his books horror, but they are definitely suspenseful). This is not to say there is not a good deal of suspense in this book. It has everything and even pays some nods to the Dark Tower series (e.g. the universe on the back of a turtle and the portals to other times/dimensions are reminiscent of some imagery in It and the Dark Tower series...although the Dark Tower series pays homage to all his other works anyway). I highly recommend this book. I just don't think anyone who enjoys fiction would dislike it. I don't want to say too much because it was very enjoyable discovering every twist and turn along the way without knowing what to expect next.
1609611543|5.0|This is a book that takes a look at the development of our present day diet - especially wheat - and discusses the massive changes in the DNA of our food and how it may be affecting us.

B000SEJHRA|5.0|While Mr. Sedaris' humor may not be for all...I enjoyed it because I am a sucker for self- deprecation.  I applaud the author for his honesty and candor no matter how strange it gets!  Highly recommend all of his books thus far...started with Naked, Holidays on Ice saved me through the holidays...Me Talk Pretty was just the icing on the cake and yes...I am now almost done with Dress Your Family...Hoping to see him live in Boston in the Spring!!  Keep up the good work Sedaris...I admire your ability to tell it like you see it no matter how foolish it may make you look!  A quality lacking in most in this sad world's constant quest for acceptance and perfection...
B003O86FMW|4.0|All I can say is I've got to get the third book!!  This series has me totally hooked! Catniss rocks!
B0083DJWGO|5.0|The author showcases how many prefer not to assume risks and are quite good at this and doing that they fragilize more and more the weak. So overall the system looks stronger not because is stronger but for that the weak were eliminated. I haven't finished the book yet but is a good value for money and for me is easy to read as I read the previous book of the author ( Black Swan ).
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|First of all, I loved the book!  With The Phoenix Project, Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford has written one of the most thought-provoking IT books I've read in recent years.<br /><br />The Phoenix Project is actually a novelization of DevOps principles rather than a strict how-to book on transforming IT Operations.  It is written in the tradition of IT Novels such as the Stealing The Network series, which I read voraciously when I was learning about Information Security.  I find the idea of using the genre of fiction to teach IT theory to be extremely effective, especially the concepts of DevOps, which are foreign to so many who are in the \\"traditional\\" IT space.  The Phoenix Project provides a vivid use case that describes the dysfunctional relationship which exists, not only between traditional IT and the Lines of Business, but between different groups within IT itself.  But not only does the book describe the problem, it offer a path to follow in order to transform IT into a true partner to the Business.<br /><br />The protagonist in The Phoenix Project is Bill Palmer, newly promoted to VP of IT Operations for Parts Unlimited, a leading automotive parts manufacturer and retailer.  The problem is that Palmer has been promoted because his managers were fired due to the failures of the IT department, particularly in completing a software initiative, called The Phoenix Project.  This Phoenix Project is a software suite, developed in-house, designed to integrate manufacturing and retail while allowing Parts Unlimited to be more agile and nimble in accommodating to changes in market conditions.  The project is intended to save the company, which has missed earning consistently and has fallen behind its main competitor; unfortunately, the project is millions of dollars over-budget and years late in delivery.  Palmer is thrown on to the proverbial sinking ship and quickly caught up in one emergency after another and soon realizes that unless something quickly changes, The Phoenix Project is doomed to failure and along with it, Parts Unlimited.  However, Palmer finds himself ill-equipped to understand and to implement the necessary changes to right the ship, especially when there is so much distrust and infighting within the IT organization and with the Lines of Business.<br /><br />Then Palmer meets the enigmatic Erik Reid, a potential board member with some very unusual ideas for how to run IT Operations.  Palmer is understandably skeptical but is soon drawn in as Reid takes him down the rabbit hole; through a series of encounters and events, Reid enlightens Palmer as to what is the true mission of IT and what must be done to make IT work as a partner to the Business.  The truths that are discovered not only change Palmer but the entire culture of IT at Parts Unlimited.<br /><br />I had two different reactions as I was reading The Phoenix Project.  The first half of the book often made me reflexively reach for the Maalox as I found myself standing in Palmer's shoes, reliving outages caused by buggy code and miscommunication between IT departments.  The second half of the book reads like the script from The Karate Kid, as we see Erik Reid, Aka. Mr. Miyagi, guide Bill Palmer, Aka. young Daniel, down the path to enlightenment about not only the methodology of DevOps but the cultural shift that is required for change.  Sometimes the lessons involve seeing tasks that seem to have little value to sound IT Operations, but Reid is able to masterfully walk Palmer through the process until he sees the proper connections between Manufacturing Plant operations and IT Operations.<br /><br />That relationship between Manufacturing Plants and IT was, for me, the key insight provided by the book.  As Erik Reid succinctly states to Bill Palmer, \\"If you think IT Operations has nothing to learn from Plant Operations, you're wrong. Dead wrong.  Your job as VP of IT Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure IT service.\\"  This is one of the best definition of IT Operations and also one of the most insightful statements on resource management that I've read to date.  After all, what can be more basic to resource management, rather it be a data center, software development team, Cloud, or people, than ensuring they deliver value through the completion of planned work?  Yet I would argue that because this is not the ultimate goal of many IT shops, they are easily sidetracked by the urgent and prevented from doing what is important.<br /><br />The rest of the book shows how Palmer, with help from Reid, is able to inculcate a new culture in the IT department at Parts Unlimited so they can focus on the mission of saving the company by enabling the business of the company.  Along the way, they learn about the four categories of work (business projects, internal IT projects, changes, and unplanned work), the Three ways, and the importance of Kanban.  Each new discovery by Palmer and team is a call to action for IT departments that know they cannot maintain the status quo and must transform themselves to meet the demands of the current business environment.<br /><br />I  look forward to learning more and applying the principles from books such as the Phoenix Project.  Now if only I could find a portable version of a Kanban Board!

B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I chose this cover because there isn't an Otter Box made for a 7&#34; Kindle Fire. It is just an ok product. There is no screen cover so that had to be purchased separately and the cover simply gets in the way. It is suppose to fold on to itself and allow the KF to sit at an angle but the channel barely holds it, which means don't put too much pressure or force on the touch screen. That being said it is lightweight and substantial enough to protect the KF, I just would not have purchased it if I had seen it before I bought it.

If there is any negative critic out there, I'd likely read it, but already I am a skeptic about his or her literacy.<br /><br />I've laughed, and nearly cried at his stories but he is able to convey the tragedies, the horrific, the mundane in an unsentimental way that is the hallmark of every great writer.<br /><br />Don't miss it, if you haven't read it and the others, you shouldn't consider yourself well-read.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|Is a great game. Really fun with new features. You can even revive yourself if need be. Over all is a great game. They took cool stuff that should have been in the first one and added it in this one. :)
0671015206|4.0|this book is okay.  I thought it would be more of a story.  It discusses & compares peoples different ways of saving and thinking of how to handle/manage money.  Actually, if a person really stops and thinks a little about, anything they say in the book is not rocket science.  But then, I am a conservative person who lives within my means and managing money is not a problem in our household.

0375869026|5.0|This is an honest and comfortable treatment of an uncomfortable subject. August is a 5th grader born with an extreme facial deformity. This story is told by him and also from several other viewpoints-- some of the kids in his school, his teenage sister, and some of his sister's friends, all of whom have to find their own paths for \\"dealing\\" with August and appreciating all that is a WONDER about him. The voices are all very realistically written, and the story is moving, with themes of kindness, courage, and coping with the challenges that life hands you. Highly recommend!

B00AMBK0X4|1.0|You know that episode of southpark that is a parody of The Shining? Randy loses it after watching this movie. I get it now. This was just awful. It was just like watching a bad episode of family guy, one of the later seasons when whichever writer made the show funny left and Macfarlane began writing his own stuff.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I'm really disappointed with this book because it has so many more description or rehash of Pride and Prejudice..It is so boring that I still have not finished this book. I can't stand reading more than half a chapter in one sitting.

B009TSA6YE|5.0|Great Dvd from this guitar legend which show cases Doogie White on vocalist singing his heart out. It actually sounds great with Schenkers old music. Doogie is a great fit in his band but I'm sure hes only temporary being that hes involved in other projects.This is one great Dvd,professionally made,sounds great,has two former Scorpions players on it which is always great. Cant beat this Dvd for the performance they do,one of the best out there.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|So, I must admit - this is my FIRST book about Zombies. Yes, I know - you may ask, &#34;Where have you been?&#34; I'm the kind of individual that tends to shy away &#34;what's popular&#34; and couldn't really get on board with &#34;the current zombie universe&#34; as it is and as it has become a huge part of our culture. But, on a whim, after seeing the amazing trailer for the movie, I was enticed to pick up the author's book. Well, after reading about 3 pages on my Kindle, I was hooked! Not that I don't think &#34;zombie literature&#34; and stories about this phenomena will be recognized as literary hallmarks of our culture (what if....?), but certainly, in terms of entertainment, the subject will keep you engaged, suspends disbelief, and transports you to the center of the story - isn't that what a good book or story is supposed to do? Get this book, read it, enjoy it, and use it's power of story telling to keep you engaged in your own mental exercise daily. You'll see &#34;the walking dead&#34; in way like never before and in another light for sure!<br /><br />AEG in Seattle

If I could throw out the (push the envelope scenes) and keep the guys funny, sweet, odd, without the the garbage, it would be perfect.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I purchased this book I thought I was about to read a light young adult romance that I could leisurely read over a week or two (I have two young kids and don't have much time to read). Boy, was I wrong! This was an emotion filled romance with an intense and intriguing story line that kept me reading until 4 in the morning. Very well written with relatable characters that you're rooting for. I laughed and cried and am so happy I found this author. I can't wait to read her other books!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a must have game. you need to get it. I highly recommend it. it is very fast and is the perfect amount of sensitivity. get this game now!

0061726834|5.0|I loved this book.  Delirium tells the story of a girl growing up in a parallel USA where love is viewed as a disease and every attempt is made to avoid and eliminate it.  They've even developed a cure.  This is a first person novel, written from the perspective of a 17-year-old girl named Lena.  The imagery, voice and details are clear and makes this novel real.  You jump right into her head, understand her fears and insecurities.  I was really impressed by the way the author showed when Lena was overwhelmed or stressed.  Lena never has to say it because you feel it along with her: reality coming at you in scattered moments, focusing on certain images or noises, everything is spinning.  When she is confused, you're confused.  And when Lena is scared, the author amps up with the tension until your heart is beating quickly too.  It's been a long time since I've done a lot of reading and this was an amazing way to welcome me back to work of books.  And something to aspire to as an writer.  Fast-paced.  Couldn't put it down.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I am in the minority with these films. I thought the Dark Knight was a step back from Batman Begins... It was just too much overall. The Dark Knight Rises is the most somber and emotionally compelling of the three. \\"Rises\\" was less about action and more about character development. However, the ending would have been stronger had there been no revelation that the autopilot was repaired. Such details could have be disclosed in a possible sequel, if ever produced.

B004CLYKLI|2.0|I understand pushing your children because you want to see them achieve everything.  I have two kids of my own but how she does it is sad and demeaning.  She thinks just because her children make it to Ivy League that makes her a successful mom. I would rather happy healthy, both mentally and physically then an Ivy League kid any day.  My sons will be successful and happy.  That is all I can ask for as a mom.  There is a part in the beginning where she says she actually locked here baby outside in the freezing winter cold because she wouldn't apologize for playing with the piano keys.  My three year old would have done the same thing out of defiance. She even said she realized she made a poor decision.  Really. Shouldn't that be common sense.  You don't lock a three year old baby outside in the snow and cold half naked to make a point.  Horrible.  My baby when he was two accidentally ordered this book.  It disgusted and appealed me.  I am glad my parents took my sister from china at 3 years old and have given her a happy successful childhood.  She is fluent in English and Chinese and she has gone to private school since she stated.  My parents expected a lot but then rewarded us for how much they pushed.  They realized that you need both.  What this lady obviously doesn't understand.  Don't buy this book if you love children.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|Is love really blind and why and how do we chose whom we will love forever?  This book delivers a new twist on these age old questions.  If you thought you knew a lot about music and it's effects on the mind, body, and soul this  book may open a new way of thinking.  Think you're well versed in the bible?  This book will most definitely surprise...possibly even shock you.  Jodi Picoult broached a topic many people are uncomfortable with and wove it into a beautifully written lyrical story.  Sing You Home is a must read.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Even though it was a little difficult to get into at first my aunt told me to keep reading and I am glad she did.  This was an amazing book.  Even with the crazy story matter the who done it was amazingly written out.  The details completely engaging.  Read this way before I even became aware of a movie coming out.  Glad I did.  The book, like usual completely out did the movie.  Amazing book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is a challenging game as you get to the higher levels. You have to think, think, think.It is a fun game.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love to play this game it helps relax me when I'm stressed out. it helps calm me down when I'm upset its a good game to play
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|I really enjoy watching old movies and this is one of my favorites and Cary Grant provided an exellent performance!
B00493E1GI|5.0|Thumbs up.  For those of you who struggle with life's mysteries and how to go after what you desire in life.  Courage is required.
0345803485|1.0|Horrible!! I can't believe people think this book is an awesome read! Not only is the writing sophmoric it is also morally corrupt. It glorifies child abuse and its perpetuation. It revels in the corruption of an innocent girl by a severely damaged man. I got about half way through hoping for redemption. It became clear that it wasn't coming. I stopped reading the book. Maybe something great happens by the end and the characters profess the child abuse to be evil. I will never know because I will never finish the book. It was a waste of time and money. Do not let it corrupt your psyche or your soul! This book portays the epitome of what is wrong with our society. I only wish that was its perspective. It is not. Consider this a WARNING!
B004NOCCEG|5.0|This amazing film documents how Wall Street bankers committed the largest financial fraud in the history of the world. They knew exactly what they were doing and systematically removed all the consumer protections that would prevent it. Not only did the financial industry analysts ignore the warning signs, they lobbied to remove them.
B00005JKGK|4.0|It's a movie about different cultures and how they react when old and young do not agree on how to handle problems.
B00002R0MC|5.0|In the 90's I owned this CD set and loved it until it was stolen from my vehicle. I was very excited to own this again when I saw it on Amazon. Unfortunately it is not the same 4 disc set that I owned in the 90's. Perhaps due to copyright litigation? Unsure about why but I was very disappointed to discover that the &#34;Acoustic Medley&#34; that was on the original album is no longer part of this set. It appears that the acoustic medley of songs Bob originally recorded as one song have been split up into separate songs and are sold individually elsewhere? I still give the album 5 stars but am very disappointed as I purchased the album specifically ti hear them again....Bummer
0800141660|5.0|I love anything by Jane Austen.  This story is about sisters who are not wealthy and thus are hindered in marriage choices.
B005LAIIRQ|3.0|This movie was not at all like the previews they ran on TV, the graphic's were terrible. It was almost like a kid make this movie, the wolves in it were so terribly portrayed it was awful..If you want to see it Rent it not worth the money I spent to buy it. Sorry..<br />Thanks Ronda
B005S9EJ14|5.0|One of the best movies for everyone.  It can be watched over and over and never be boring.  It will  be a favorite for years.
B005LAIGLE|4.0|This movie had a lot of hype, but it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I love Mark Wahlberg but this wasn't his best movie..<br />Thanks Ronda
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching Downton Abbey after my Mother-in-law requested it.  Well, DirectTv doesn't offer this specific PBS Channel so I got the first Season from Netflix and the second season and now 3 on Amazon Prime.  I love this show.  I look forward to each week's episode.  The wardrobe is magnificent and the actors are superb.  Not quite sure yet how I feel about Shirley Mclaine's character or part in Series 3 (although she is one of my favorite actors) but in general it's just an awesome show.
0307272702|4.0|Simply a must-read. Gary writes entertainingly about a complex matter. I feel like the scales have lifted from my eyes. I'm much more knowledgable as a result and less likely to buy into the fad diets out there. His blog is really worth subscribing to - lots of up-to-date news.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love Rick Riordan's books and this was a great continuation<br />of the heroes of Olympus series and I can't wait until the next book
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Just what we needed to help our 9 year old sleep soundly. Soothing sounds and easy volume control. This is the perfect app for when you need to eliminate distractions and relax.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I was so glad to have finally read the actual words behind all of the film versions of this story. Since I was a child, I've been intrigued by every film adaptation of 'A Christmas Carol' and wondered how much of each was true to the original text. I enjoyed reading it much more than any interpretation I've seen, and will make it a tradition to read it every Christmas from now on.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I got glued to the game only recently and since then its been addictive and my wife hares it if I play. When I saw the new release of temple run,I was thrilled and decided to try it immediately. The change in graphics, the scenaries, are all very refreshing. I felt the new version to be tougher than the old one - I was frequently tripping, missing the turns and jewels as it became more sudden than the first version. Now am totally on to this version. However there are some annoying bugs in the version I have installed in my first generation kindle fire. If I tilt during sudden turns, it decides to jump instead. And at times when I try to use the save me 2nd or 3rd time in the same run, it crashes the app and the home screen shows up. please fix these and send us an upgrade. on the positive side, the first version of the game would stall at times and the graphics would be jerky. That seems to have reduced in this version and mostly it is smooth. Great job! Looking forward to stealing the idol again!
B009PMB3CI|1.0|No instructions, very few interactions, no returns, no returns and it's two bucks? No. All positive reviews must be from very young children.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is good but short.it is really easy too or u r looking 4 a easy book then here it is.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I love this game and play it daily!!  I like to challenge myself to get a<br /><br />faster score with each time I play.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|At first I was bored with the plain old temple run so I switched to subway suffer then I thought to my self if they can create a new version of subway suffer they can create a new temple run so I waited for days then it came I was so happy now I can't stop playing temple run 2 it's is fun loving and addicting
B003D83DPA|4.0|Very enjoyable concert with great musicians !  Video was a bit &#34;grainy&#34; but not intrusive to the eye.  Voice audio was not very discreet on most selections in performance, but Knopfler was never the most distinct enunciator of lyrics ( although most of the bands CD recordings were much more clear).  The result came from the record levels at the board, most likely.  The instrumentals were much better in record quality , the base was a bit low, but otherwise a very good rendering of the original master with todays technology.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like this game it requires a little skill adn knowledge of what the birds are capable of doing. It is a great game that holds your attention span for long periods.
B003O86FMW|1.0|This book was not the best book I've read it was the worst book I've ever read I will not read The others
B005HSL626|4.0|I really like the game I previously played it on my mother I-pad. It is action packed and fun to plasy for all ages.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Works well with my acer tablet.  I like the doc. process!  Great price for the doc. 3.0 app. Thanks again.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|It's a good app for soothing reasons but the alarm doesn't work well at all....  I have set it even while I'm up during the day to see why I didn't wake up but still didn't work! Not to happy about this app good thing I didn't pay for it..
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Great additive doc. to go full version key.  It works well with my acer tablet for a good price.  Thanks
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was a great start and a great book! I am going to read the rest!!!! Loved it! You should too!!
0062101897|5.0|I am probably one of the biggest Harry Potter fans around.  I needed this book to complete my collection.  I was just expecting it to be similiar to the Film Wizardry book.  But it is a lot more in depth.  If you are curious about the behind-the-scenes aspects of the movies, this book is definately for you
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game is amazing! The only problem is sometimes there is a lag, and its not sensitive enough! Overall it's great.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's a great instant messenger and it sends messages fast ... kik me at paxiepoo I'm 15 f and from the US (:
B0031RS4UM|4.0|This was a riveting story. It is a roller coaster ride from start to finish and one gets to know more about Reacher's sense of morality.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I loved RED ... but then I like action movies with a smattering of humor.  Bruce Willis and the cast are great!
B0031RS2HC|3.0|Killing Floor<br />A good start to the series. Nice to see where the person came from and why he is how he is.
0062200909|5.0|This is a terrific art book--very, very detailed and rich artwork.  My only problem is that the DVD of this movie is not available yet, so to do any comparisons with the movie takes yet another trip to the theater!  The book is so full of richly colored and detailed drawings, paintings, photographs and movie stills that it is slow reading--which is fine with me.  I think it even surpasses the books published on LOTR artwork.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|If you love the show, you'll love the music by itself.  A must have for Connie Britton fans and anyone who likes good music.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille needs to find a new protagonist persona.  However, I liked the fast pace and the history of the region.
B00181JGI2|2.0|So if you like the Coen brothers, you've been told you MUST see this movie.  People talk about it in almost reverent tones, but I found it more like The Three Stooges:  You either love 'em or hate 'em, and I'm neither a fan of the Stooges or of this movie.  Don't misconstrue me to saying this is like a Stooges movie; rather that both are a \\"you do or you don't taste.\\"<br /><br />An obviously great cast, with a few wry laughs, but seemingly weird for weirdness' sake.  Plus, it has all the swearing of a Tarantino film without the truly great dialogue (that some of his movies have).  If I'm going to be beaten over the head with the language of the docks/high-school, at least give me some substance to go with it.<br /><br />All in all, I felt more in the camp of, \\"I wish I had those two hours of my life back\\" than I did, \\"Glad I finally saw that.\\"
B005IQZB14|3.0|Not all characters are ones you love and identify with.  People may not like this book because Cheryl doesn't always make the popular or knowledgable choices.  Sometimes you want to shout at her...sometimes a good book is one that makes you mad or angry or disappointed in humanity.  An interesting but not great story. I feel like I got my money's worth reading it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great fun.  This is what a game sequel should be:  as good or better than the original.  Cudos to Imangi Studios.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wasn't expecting that at all. I was enthralled from the beginning but had know idea where this story was going. I was shocked....pleasantly !!!!!
B009A87ZKG|4.0|An excellent performance by George C. Scott (who has an uncanny resemblence to the real Patton) and a film that hits all the right marks in all departments.  Also a terrific job of transferring the film to Blue-Ray disc.
B00138KKP8|5.0|Soulful debut album from Ray LaMontagne. Understated production allows the singer's voice to be at the forefront.  &#34;Trouble&#34; i worth thte price of admission, but be sure to keep listening because the other songs are equally great.  What a voice!
B004L0NGEC|4.0|Not all of my pictures transferred.  I think I need to read the &#34;manual&#34; for my Kindle Fire to see what I did wrong.
B00A757EFW|4.0|it is a great game. it is very similar to an arcade game I played years ago called ladybugs. that would be a good one to offer us players.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I'm a &#34;huge&#34; fan of John Grisham.  I think I've read everything he's written.  So, whenever he has a new book out, I devour it.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I think it is a good game because it is very challenging. once you start you do not want to put it down.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|ENJOY ALL JOHNNY DEPP MOVIES. I WATCHED THE ORIGINAL SERIES ON TV BACK WHEN WITH JONATHIN FRID AS BARNABAS COLLINS.  THE SHOW BROUGHT OUT THE COMPASSION AND SADNESS OF BARNABAS.  THE MOVIE WITH JOHNNY DEPP BROUGHT BACK FUN MEMORIES OF THE SHOW.  DEPP SEEMS TO GET ANY CHARACTER HE PLAYS JUST RIGHT. IN THIS MOVIE PORTRAYING THE NASTY VAMPIRE BUT STILL SHOWING HIS LOVE FOR JOSETTE AND HIS FAMILY.  THE MOVIE HAD COMEDY IN JUST THE RIGHT SPOTS WITH A JUST AWAKENED VAMPIRE COMING BACK TO A NEW ERA.  WOULD WATCH IT AGAIN
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It gets the job done. Sometimes it wont load messages and you have to either bring up the side bar and choose it again, hoping it works, or you have to quit the app entirely and then start it again. Chat functions ok. Posting to your timeline is easy enough too.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Hiding Place,gave one a mental picture of life ,before the war of a very devoted and loveing family.Then the changes that they and their friends and neighbors had to endure,when Germany occupied their community.The struggle to hide and help,neighbors ,as well as strangers, to escape the Natiz's teririonity.Seperation and life endured by those in a concentration camp.Their faith in God,which they shared with all is what helped them to survey.<br />This a time in History,we should never forget.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Gets the job done and comes from a trusted source. Adding different places is easy, but plotting them on the in app map is a bit difficult. That's the only real gripe.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is the bomb fizzle I got the first one and this one was even better. this game is mint
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I think I may have missed the boat on this one, as I cant find many people who play anymore. It's easy to connect to random games  but you never know if those people will come back the next day. Only a few of my facebook friends play which may be limiting my enjoyment as well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My children play this constantly! They enjoy it! Keeps them very busy! Have to take it away occasionally and make them take a break!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|But in a good way! This match three game is highly addictive and I've had to have sunk at least 10 hours into it over the course of a few weeks. Once you grasp the little differences between this and other match three you'll enjoy it too. The addition of 'end stage' semi-hidden picture puzzles is nice too.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|While the underlining story is great I didn't think this book was well written. BUt then again maybe that was the point
0812993357|3.0|This could be seen as the book a sophisticated Welsh woman would write for the American market.  There is a hint of laughter as she describes the peccadilloes of her rather extraordinary family and the summer hotel they maintained on the Welsh Atlantic coast.  This idyll lasted until Grace was about three and World War II caused the hotel to be closed and British and North American soldiers were billeted there.<br />She developed a taste for fashion as a child in Wales; she read her big sister's copies of Vogue and developed a taste for making her own clothes using Vogue patterns.  This interest foretold her future in fashion at first British Vogue and then American Vogue. When the time came for her transformation to becoming a young working woman she found a coupon in Vogue for a London modeling school and she was away.  The rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />A memoir must be egocentric, and this one is no exception.  I found it rather tediously so.  That said, the adventures of Grace in London, Paris, and New York are an interesting look at the post-war and later years of fashion, now relegated to the picture books.  There is an excellent series of photos of those days, and a wonderful selection of drawings of herself, her friends and her cats.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an amazing story of a husband and wife that centers around the disappearance of the wife on the couple's five year wedding anniversary.  The suspense and the twists and turns this story takes are more than enough to keep you enthralled.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if you love horses than this is the game for u because you get to care for horse and compeate with your horse you can even renamed your horse any time you want.  mine is named Chocolate but if like the origanal name witch is Beauty.  I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run2 awesome .I play it everyday it is so cool.If you have this game or not you will love it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Cant drag myself away til I get stumped. lol Love this game! It kinds challenges your mind. I like to go back and try to beat a level again but do it a different way. j<br />Just wish I could get hints for free.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|When I was downloading it it drained half of my battery! Besides that it was  great game<br />I recommend it to all
0765325950|3.0|Finally, this epic 20+ year series comes to a close, but was this long-delayed conclusion worth the waiting?<br /><br />The answer, in short, yes.<br /><br />Mostly because everyone wants to know if and how Rand will defeat the Dark One.<br /><br />Subjectively, I can't say this was a satisfying ending. It seemed like Sanderson (or Jordan with Sanderson?) assumed that at this point, the readers would already be sympathetic with all the protagonists, so there was no point in further developing the characters.<br /><br />I would liken reading this novel to how I felt watching all the Frodo/Samwise scenes of The Return of the King movie. There was just this pervasive and lingering sense of \\"uncomfortable-ness\\" throughout, with the constant sense of danger and seemingly unsolvable problems throughout, like an itch in the back of your mind.<br /><br />The deaths of several characters were epic, in theory, but anti-climactic in feeling, as this book just had too much going on and in reading this, a year or more after the last one, empathy wasn't re-established.<br /><br />Another issue was the (most times, brief) inclusion of so many secondary and tertiary characters from throughout the novels that I had to constantly go to the Wheel of Time wikia to look up who was who and when they were introduced and what they were last doing. I believe the authors could have dedicated one or two lines when each of these characters were introduced in this novel just to give the readers something to work off of while continuing to read.<br /><br />The actual ending of this particular novel is left somewhat open-ended, and I personally wanted a bit more wrap-up, with perhaps a glimpse into the future, because after 14 books, you're a bit attached to this world and its populace and want to know things will be okay.<br /><br />The absolute highlight for me was the exchange between Egwene, the Amyrlin Seat, and Tuon, the Empress of Seanchan. So deliciously catty and vicious that I had to read it three times to fully savor the genius in its writing.ad it three times to fully savor the genius in its writing.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I played this EVERYDAY because it was the only puzzle app that had pieces option w/ actual challenges of 200+ pieces &amp; most apps aren't even traditional JIGSAW puzzles.  But, as of today the most pieces the puzzle can be in is 54! So, I guess the target age group is children????
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I did not like it because I did not understand it.  .I will not recommend it to anyone..it should come with instructions so deleted it from my kindle.
B009GE9Y44|4.0|I liked this version of this movie and I would recommend it to my friends. There is plenty of action to see.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I am using Asus infinity and the game not run smooth  update is needed for asus tablets android 4.1 thanks
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|coin dozer is the bomb ...its very fun and additive to play.my daughter is trying to compete with me and she can't. because I am on level 30 and she's on level 13 lol.so for those who get this app have fun.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is really good and I thought that this was a new way to spend my time on. You should let your kid play it
B00ARN0YDS|1.0|The ending was terrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. The 4th one has definitely gone down hill big time from the other ones.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is really good and fun for every kid to play instead of one game it is 132 games. You should let your kid play it
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I don't need to say much about this. Leonard Cohen is your gracious, warm-hearted host for the evening. He will sing you some of the best written poems/songs we have in our singer/songwriter/poet tradition. I am a huge Bob Dylan fan and I know the term poet gets used freely in the context of these two musicians. But there are poets, and there are poets. Some, like Dylan, have a huge body of work full of misses with some amazingly powerful hits. Leonard Cohen is the much more careful crafstman. His body of work is much smaller than Dylan's, but strikingly more consistent in it's quality. And he really is the most gracious of hosts. He will charm you with between song talk and recitation. He is wonderfully generous with his excellent band. I could wish that the music wasn't quite as finely polished as what we hear, but this does show a tremendous amount of respect for his audience. Leonard Cohen wants to deliver the highest quality show in the business, and start to finish, he gives us just that, two full CDs worth of memorable music.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I bought this book for my kindle, and wherever and whenever I sit and read it, I laugh and cry out loud - it doesn't matter where I am, the library, work, wherever.  It is so funny!  She has also put into words things I had felt about growing up but hadn't really been able to express.  Highly recommended.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game on my home computer, now I love it just as much on my kindle fire. CAUTION: VERY ADDICTIVE!!!!!!!!
B000002H5I|5.0|I have followed Tracy Chapman since she debuted and as great as she's become you can't beat her first CD!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This new version  of temple run  is amazing. I thought I was addicted to the original and then I tried  out this  new one and I waste my whole battery playing this. It's amazing. I could literally spend all day on this.
B00APUQH0W|1.0|This movie was very enjoyable, with classic Clint Eastwood (it helps if you are a baseball fan).  This was the first (and most likely the last) movie I will stream using Amazon.  We have Verizon FIOS at a fairly high download speed.  We ordered and paid for the HD version, but this movie was streamed in SD, plus at times it just froze up.  The HD cost was $1.00 less than ordering it from Verizon On Demand, but at least when you order an HD movie from them, you get an HD movie.  I would have happily paid the extra $1.00 to watch in HD.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|The only negative thing about this game is that it is so darn addictive (which really isn't all that negative after all), I downloaded as the Free App of the Day and haven't put it down since. Gameplay is great, its just hard enough to be fun, not aggrevating; graphics and soundtrack are awesome. My favorite part; the OCD Challenge on every level, I have driven myself bonkers trying to get that little white flag, but I have gotten them all so far. The little phrases that run at startup are great as well.<br />This is the best game I have played in a very long time. Even though I got my version free, I have paid the 5 bucks for each one of my nieces and nephews (there are 17 of them so you do the math) to have as much fun as I am having. I haven't beat it all yet and hope I don't for a while.<br />I haven't had any technical problems on my Alcatel Authority, a bit of lagging here and there and thats all. Its great that the game is on my phone not off the internet, I get to play it anywhere I like. Hats off to the developers.<br />WOULD GIVE IT TEN STARS IF I COULD!!
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|This app is okay.  I do like jet fighters but there are definitly other games I would play over this one.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am a long time reader of Stephen King and love his work.  I stopped reading for a time and picked up this book.  If you are looking for the 'monsters' then this book does not have them.  The 'monsters' here are all too human.  Great story which like most fantasy requires a 'leap of faith' and a proper suspension of belief at times.  The premise of time travel has been done and done.  One of the best time travel books in my humble opinion was a little science fiction book by Robert Silverberg call Up the Line that really delved into the paradoxes and problems of people being able to travel back in time.  Overall, this was a great book with a somewhat surprisingly warm ending.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a fabulous book.  It opened me up to what a great world of reading is out there.  I have never been a big reader but this series has got me flipping the pages with enthusiasm.
0817439390|5.0|This is a user friendly and read friendly book.  The author takes great time and patience in explaining in the basics of the 'triangle'.  Where he uses technical terms, he breaks them down into easy to understand ideas and how they are used.  As a point of reference, I am a beginning photographer and although I was familiar with aperature, shutter speed, etc., I found this book and its many examples to the be very enlightening and instructive.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Hours of fun!  I play this often.  I love playing cards but hate shuffling and dealing.  It is great just to play the game with the computer doing all the work
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent reading and never boring. I enjoyed this book from start to finish. I wish it had more pictures though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game.  I love to build!  It is almost a virtual LEGO game.  I build things and then tear them down and start all over again.
0060936223|3.0|There is a Cinderella quality to the story. Patti Smith wasn't one of the beautiful people. She wasn't a well-educated trust fund baby living the bohemian life. She was a working class kid from the suburbs who wanted to be something more. Robert Mapplethorpe is her Prince Charming in this story, a rebel who came from money despite having none and was equal parts loyal friend and self-absorbed social-climbing prick.<br /><br />Smith provides a window on a lost world of New York arts and music, the magic of the Chelsea Hotel, and, more than anything, the fancy and folly of youth.<br /><br />Some have criticized the adolescent quality of Smith and Mapplethorpe in this book, but hey, it's a memoir of their lives together in their early 20s, so I'll let it pass. I was pretty insufferable at 21 too.<br /><br />Smith's relentless name-dropping, obtuse prose, sometimes repetitious writing and general lack of self awareness threaten to drag this little memoir down, but I still found it quite enjoyable.
B009JBZH54|4.0|This is a great set. The only two minor drawbacks are the non-holographic packaging and parts of the third movie jump between IMAX and widescreen formats.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game. it can duck u Kb tho and I wish u didn't have to pay money for more gems
B00AYB1CDO|5.0|Beautiful work. Samsara is the follow up, and even better. Go to the Baraka website to find out where all these amazing locations are.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The domino effect of a death on a small British village was interesting enough to finish.... but not very inspired.  Very few of the characters were even a little likable... maybe just more tolerable than others.  The secrets harbored \\"behind closed doors\\" were many and varied.  Perhaps because of reading this book,  I may be more aware of unusual situations that one may encounter on any given day, but one just puts aside due to self-absorption or \\"sticking ones nose\\" where it doesn't (but maybe should) belong.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This app is fun for many different ages. You can still play it without spending any money it just takes more time.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Loved this book so much could not put it down. The characters and story plot was so different and refreshing. Although some of the events that took place had me cringing.I would recommend for anyone that loves books that deal with slavery but which gives the characters so much depth and dimension that its hard to believe its a work of fiction.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Great songs on here! Love them all. It's the Beatles, so need I say more? great, great, great, great, great...
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|this game would rock if u didn't have to wait so long to get things done. I am ready to quit this game. I do not recommend this game. it really sucks
B009MF56GC|5.0|This movie has just about everything in it that most men want in a movie. It has action, comedy, blood and guts, need I say more??? Also some really greats lines in as well. (Just think of who all is in the movie.)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is really an addictive game, you can play for hours without stopping.  Once again, my husband loves this one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, graphics are awesome. I dont normally rate games, but this one needed to be rated. Would definitely recommend for horse lovers!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love how real the fruit looks when it is being sliced!  The graphics are really great!  I could play for hours without stopping!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I always rate a book by how long it take me to read it? This book was so good that I had a hard time putting it down. So I read it in two days, I had to go to work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on my blackberry and I absolutely love it.  It is important to always be able to have the Word of God with me and this makes it easy to not have to pack my actual Bible.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Loved this season. You can't miss it.  Just wish season 2 was out already.  Everyone must see season one. Great.
B000ZELISO|4.0|I got a Blu-Ray player for Christmas and only got the last 2 movies, so I bought this one to complete the set.  Came as shown in the pictures and worked right out of the packaging.
B004WR125O|5.0|Works great. Just plugged it in, it found my network in a jiffy and works perfectly.  . . . .
B005LW5J9O|5.0|The compelling true story of the Renaissance humanists who rescued Greek and Roman philosophy from oblivion is written in a way that had me engaged, and eagerly reading.
B00846REIS|4.0|Followed a bit of the Shades of Grey...but, it was a good read. I have not purchased the second one...maybe waiting to borrow it for free.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Amazing acting. Simple yet powerful plot. Fun to see so many familiar actors. Gives some insight to the pressures and idiosyncrachies of monarchy.
B00330UFQS|3.0|They are ok, I like them, but not one of my favorites. I would rather just hear a random song on the radio, but that is just me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book jumps right into the story from the very beginning.  It was hard to put it down.  The book had an interesting plot that was not easily predictable except when the author gave you clues. It was a great weekend read.
B001KQKC0Q|5.0|Just wish all my music did not get lost from Amazon. This was an album I did listen to alot.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I was looking for more focus on the hike but over all it was a good read.  The ending is kinda weak and at times it seems more like fiction.
B004U52VPS|5.0|How can you go wrong with Angry Birds, Other than you will want to upgrade to Ice or as we are looking into Star Wars.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|It took me the first series to get hooked, but now after watching all of the 2nd season, I'm hooked. These two are great together. I love the story line versus the out-of-order feel of the first season. The first half of the first season was all over the place. I almost didn't finish it.  But I kept watching just because I had nothing better to do. By the end, the story line finally settled in, ending the season admirably, stringing me along to the 2nd season.
B0018CENUC|5.0|I can not find any of the music I purchased for Amazon. I loved every album, but not willing to risk buying and it getting lost and not having it anymore.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|It took me the first series to get hooked, but now after watching all of the 2nd season, I'm hooked. These two are great together. I love the story line versus the out-of-order feel of the first season. This one has a story line that moves along at a good pace. Keep up the great work!
B00802JMPO|5.0|The books are great and exactly what I expected. I couldn't put them down and ended up reading the entire series in less than a week. I would highly recommend this set!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The DVD set came quickly and was in great order. I was unsure of buying a series I had never seen or even heard of before. This was the first and still only such series I've bought with no prior intel. I trusted the ratings from amazon, and they were spot on. Wonderful series!
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|The main character, the first lady detective in Botswana, is introduced in this book.  I normally hate mysteries but I loved this book as it was so fresh and unique. I can't wait to read the next volume in this series!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|From the first game you are sucked in and before you know it an hour has gone by and you do not want to stop. Love this game!
B002V6RB1C|5.0|Classic movie. Definitely one in my list of Top 100 movies of all time. Paul Newman's best (and coolest) role ever!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is probably my 5th Sparks book, &#34;Dear John&#34; being my favourite. This book is unlike any other Sparks book I've read. Once again, Sparks brings together imperfect persons serendipitously, while giving insight into the psychological aspect of love (and what happens when that is warped). Worth the read, and of course, you cheer for the love of the main characters as it unfolds.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The sarcasm in John's first person narrative is extremely entertaining as always. The ending seemed abrupt. It left me hanging. How did they return to the U.S.?
B00338QENI|5.0|As someone who did tertiary level biochemistry, HeLa cells were familiar but I thoroughly enjoyed Skloot's journey into the woman behind this amazing cells. It never gets too scientific, and best of all, the humanness of the Lacks (and Ms. Skloot) shines through.
B005COO1X6|4.0|This is classic Stephen King. It is well described and the world is really put before you, however this really is just the beginning to a really amazing story. Too short for me.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|better than going to the movies if you have a big screen HD TV.  It has  great sound. great visual quality.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Read Pillars and World back-to-back. Sad that I'm now going to leave Kingsbridge forever. Wish this could be a trilogy as well.
B001TH16DI|5.0|better than going to the movies if you have a big screen HD TV.  It has  great sound. great visual quality.
B0037NVM2C|5.0|Sitting around bored so I decided to stream T2. I've watched the original many times so I thought I was losing my mind when I noticed something new. Surprise, surprise there was a lot added to the instant version. I didn't realize I was watching the director's cut. The new footage added some depth in some areas and certainly made the event much more interesting. Time to start rewatching some of my old favorites. Thanks!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|better than going to the movies if you have a big screen HD TV.  It has  great sound. great visual quality.
B000I0XLYO|5.0|Great, great, great!  We love this movie!  An absolute classic.  &#34;What is this?  A center for ANTS!!!&#34;  A must see!
B009RI4FRU|2.0|When I rented Moonrise Kingdom I thought that it was going to be funny but it turned out to be more a drama than anything else.  I wish they could refund my money :(
B00A03WBVI|4.0|They have some good songs and some alright songs but the album didn't blow my mind. I don't usually listen to music like this but they harmonize so well that I just had to buy this cd.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Helps me to sleep faster and longer. And i suffer from mild insomnia. With the many choices of sounds you never get bored or too use to any sounds. Any time i try something repetitive it helps for only a little while then stops. But with the ability to download more sounds ill never run out of options.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I have had the paper version of this book for years and consider it profound. I love having it on my kindle.  This is a timeless story.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I work with some old tape cameras and I needed this adapter in order to use my cameras and digitize my videos, IT JUST WORKS
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Reading this memoir is like passing through a window into another time. Two young talented dreamers take on the art world and with all that they face their care and commitment toward each other stands up. It touched my heart deeply.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I use this as my primary calculator on my iPhone and Kindle Fire.  Both work equally as well.  Didn't like many of the other offerings.  Love the function where it converts to an advanced calculator when you hold the Kindle Fire in landscape position
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great graphics. My daughter loves this app, very easy to use! Love the horse care and competitions, very realistic!<br />Would highly recommend this app for any horse lover no matter what age
B000AGTPUU|5.0|My kids have watched this movie about a zillion times. Put this on and I have time to do other stuff while they watch it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The best book that I have read in a while. Just when you think there cannot be another plot twist, Hoover puts in another surprise. What a great story.
B001P5JSJI|5.0|on blu-ray.  duh.<br /><br />buy this movie - it's worth the price of admission.  it's the matrix, after all. on blu-ray
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book takes me right back to high school, I feel every emotion Charlie feels throughout this story.  Honest and raw I loved every word.
1466401885|5.0|I loved this book. I just could not put it down. I bought it because I needed something to get free shipping and I thought this sounded interesting. Abby and Travis are easy to relate to and keep the story interesting. I can't wait to read Walking Disaster!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom continues his easy reading thought provoking style. Cleverally crafted leaves you realizing that &#34;clock watching&#34; is wasteful use of lifes precious amount of time that we all have.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|THIS SHOW IS AMERICAS NEW DARK SHADOWS. WHILE THE STORY CHANGES FROM SEASON TO SEASON, JESSICA LANGE IS IN BOTH AND SHE IS EXCELLENT.THE FANTASY AND SURREALISM OF THIS SHOW OFFERS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY  TO SHOWCASE HER RANGE AS ONE OF AMERICAS FINEST ACTRESSES. I HOPE THERE IS A SEASON THREE.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|So far so good I am loving these Nevosoft app games.All have been fun,the interactions with the charecter's are neat,the graphics are great & the challenge isn't too challenging.
1577314808|1.0|This book was created by a down on his luck nobody preying on the insecurities and fears of the masses in order to gain a following and all the cash that goes with it. His ideas are complex, disjointed, confusing and misleading. Rather than encouraging people to face reality and stand up to bullies and abusers, he advises people who have been bullied and abused to \\"surrender\\" to them. That is the worst counsel you can give to someone who has been traumatized.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I love this game,it was alot of fun & not challenging to the point that you CAN'T have fun.The graphics are great & the charecter's are fun too:)
B009ESIGHI|3.0|I'm afraid I made a mistake in buying the Muppets for four Xmas gifts, and it turns out none of them were as dediicated I am to all muppets.
B001TH16DI|5.0|A great TV series and now this fantastic collection of the the greatest space movies of all time.  The real pioneer series of space.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I love the game but I won't open and when it does it crashes. I deleted it and tried to re download, it but nothing.
B004IG8WPM|5.0|I watched this movie many years ago and decided to watch it with my little one. She loved it as much as I did. A great classic to share with the little ones.
0714864803|5.0|This book is sensational and is the ONLY Lebanese cookbook you'll ever need.  This book contains &#34;mild to wild&#34; recipes for Lebanese cuisine - including the spice mixtures necessary to create the complex flavors.  The 'deckle' edge appears to have been cut with a 'pinking shear' so the pages 'stick' together until the book has been used and the pages are fanned.  This is not a drawback, merely an observation that makes this cookbook unique from the 500+ other cookbooks I own.
B0090EJ99A|1.0|I didn't like it at all. Was hard to get through. Stopped watching about 40 minutes in. Not his best work
034580404X|5.0|This series is amazing and makes it difficult to put down. I find myself looking for more just like it!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a fresh breath of air comparing it to Temple Run. I highly recommend it. I was very impressed.
1401232590|5.0|Great read i couldn't put it down. read it in one day in like 4 hours. don't want to give to much away but its awesome
B009VLX8FS|5.0|We love this cd and all of the songs on it. You can't go wrong with Taylor Swift. Real talent that is not found very often!
B000SEI230|5.0|This book was phenomenal!I am so glad it was recommended to me me and it is definitely one of my favorite books!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book and can not wait to see how the movie holds up against it. Really surprised at the end of this book! Loved it!
B003JTHXOK|2.0|This book will make you grin from ear to ear and cry your eyes out! It's amazing how an author can bring such emotions to a human only through words!! Great choice to read, Nicholas sparks has done it yet again!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This app requires additional purchases do not bother with it. Very disappointed as it is a fake app to bring the kids in and then spend real money haha yeah right.
1419705849|4.0|This installment was on par with the previous.  The Boy loved the book and once again read it (almost) non stop. If you want your kids to read, these books are an excellent way to get them away from the tv and games.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun game east to pick up the rules. Everyone form Grandma to the kids can play and the competion is great!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Child 44 provides a very good feel for the ever-present fear of Stalinist Russia.  The book is well written and fast paced, with a gripping plot.
B008476HBM|5.0|I have been reading Pride and Prejudice every few years for the past thirty years at least. It is always a pleasure. The Kindle version gives me one more access to a book that I love. The characters in this novel have endured the test of time for a reason. They were well thought out and developed by a master of her craft. Every time that I read it I feel as though I am visiting old friends.<br />William E Sherrill,
B008MF3OEY|3.0|I've had my share of Verso covers for my Kindle Fire but this one is probably my least favorite. It is designed to look like an old book cover with a dimensional spine made of faux leather and a fabric print of endpapers. When closed up, it gives the appearance of being an old novel with the title Verso II.<br /><br />But the problem is that it feels more flimsy than other Verso covers and it has no way to keep it closed.<br /><br />The four rubberized elastic corners are good to keep your Kindle in place on the inside without hindering the view of your screen.<br /><br />The inside has a hand hold pocket if you want to flip the cover back and hold it that way. Or you can use the pocket for notes or whatever.<br /><br />Not my favorite. I actually prefer: [[ASIN:B0064RY5PO Verso Versailles Case Cover for Kindle Fire - Black/White]] which is the same price.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I book is exactly what I needed to help me format my book for Kindle. Prior to reading this, I had absolutely no idea how to go about it, but after reading this I was able to format the book. It stiil took a lot of work, but this book provided the guidance I needed to do the right work so that the finished product could be read on Kindle as I had hoped that it could.<br />William E Sherrill
1451695195|5.0|After reading some of the reviews of this book on Amazon, I hesitated to buy it.  But, I'm very glad that I DID buy the book.  The author was not egotistical as some of the reviewers had written.  He wrote about his background as a neurosurgeon to demonstrate how much he knew about what was happening to him during his illness and, then, after his return from death. He described his NDE in much detail thoughout the book.  At the end of the book, he examined his experience to determine if it could possibly have resulted from a brain symptom that occurred during his coma. What he found dismisses all his critics.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I haven't even seen all of season 3 yet, and I can't wait for season 4.  Seriously, it's<br />that good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is fun for a while. I don't like all the time it takes for your horse to rest enough. you run around doing things and they have only rested for one time. its a little annoying to how all the training is all the sameness.
B009EE4T8C|5.0|Buy it now, own it forever and watch it once a year at least. More than a movie and a history lesson.... THIS is ART, a standard by which movies are weighed.<br /><br />That is what to do... Read other reviews to better understand why...
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Has lots of unusual sounds, like fan and dryer, those would be good for a colicy baby. The water and colored sound noises are excellent. I havent noticed a loop at all. My only compl ain't would be that the timer doesnt work.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|i love facebook bettter on my labtop because its alot bigger page and better format but for the size of my tablet it aint shabby.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Enjoyed this game. Easy even for a beginner BUT challenging enough to hold my interest. The puzzles were challenging enough as well
B004XDYJRU|5.0|i enjoy this program and its free what a value i know if it wasnt free its very cheap and affordable good job great.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is a great game and has tons to do. I love the multiplayer!!!!! One of my favorite FPS for mobile devices.
B005K17RU0|5.0|its ry good for weather everywhere  just put in location and you got it very accurate and very fast good service love it.  ve
B0011UJMK2|5.0|The best crime/thriller title I've came across in this decade. Not even kidding. If you love fiction with a true/ make-believe historical and political background, Child 44 is definitely an instant buy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome!!!:) I love the zip lines twists and turns and 3d. You need to get this game it is so cool
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a very fun game that challenges your mind. my bf loves it too since he's great at puzzles. just wish you got more hints for free :)
0399160450|5.0|Classic Clancy without too much technical jargon.  I have come to  love these characters after all the Jack Ryan books I have read.  Without giving anything away, I would just like to say  I am glad there is still room for John Clark. He has been a favorite of mine since the first Clancy book I read, (Without Remorse), which made a Clancy fan of me in the first place.  A really great read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this a great game for anyone even if they are not horse lover's.<br />This game has great graphics, too. I love this game!!!
B000TGJ80S|5.0|I've enjoyed this telling of the classic tale for quite some time.  Some of Coppola's choices are most definitely artistic license and have nothing to do with the original manuscript.  Keanu Reeves will never convince me that he is not from Southern California.  Winona Ryder is sporadic as Mina.<br /><br />If you are looking for a &#34;Cliff-movie&#34; to help you with your report on Dracula, this is not it.  Some of the scenes are embellished at best and non-existent in the original text at worst.  To point: the strange scene with Harker and the &#34;Three Strange Women&#34; feels like something Peter Fonda and Jack Nicholson could have written while they were working on &#34;Easy Rider&#34;.  The reverse cinematography and &#34;disappearing&#34; images are visually intriguing, but confusing to the story.<br /><br />A visually stunning masterpiece.  The acting and flow of the movie are assuredly lacking in places.  I still love to watch this film over and over merely for the stunning spectacle.  The trace history of Vlad the Impaler is nice too.  The costumes are stunning.  The scenery magnificent.  Gary Oldman was stellar.
B003YOZNBK|5.0|At 1st i looked at this & heard so many people hating how it was made like Green Lantern but unlike Green Lantern which was terrific despite the haters, i have to agree on this particular DC Comic movie. i got it before february on last friday of the 25 it was in great condition & it was short for a comicbook movie but i can see it had a lack of creativeness to it like Green Lantern & Watchmen but it was a good movie indeed don't get me wrong it just needs a further development in the plot of story telling it's story if you know what i mean like Daredevil but Daredevil was awesome compare to Johan Hex but i love it no matter what & i hope it gets a 2nd chance just like Ghost Rider did
B000GBEWHA|4.0|For something that was mediocre on Broadway, the film version revitalized the interest in this musical.  Star talent as well as raw talent on the screen recreated an interest in this reminiscent creation of Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey.<br /><br />Fun dance numbers, memorable songs, and Stockard Channing make this film one to watch again and again.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This was a great, and quirky movie.  I enjoyed it tremendously.  The scenery was awesome also.  It is a little offbeat.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks so this was a good starting point for me to start reading on my new Kindle.<br /><br />Loved it and cant wait to see the movie.
B000002J03|5.0|Saw the band in 1970, and this CD is what I expected. Used to have LZ 2 in vinyl, so this is good
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|This was kind of hard to get into but hooks you after the first couple chapters. I enjoy the simplicity of this love story it a feel good novel.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have no idea why this book was so popular.  The writing was on the 8th grade level and the story was not compulsive.  All I can think is many women in America lead boring lives and needed it to spice up their existence.
B007ZSBQYE|5.0|the first few levles are easy,  but after those levles it gets hard.But at the end it is worth it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|don't like as much as original... but its certainly addictive. touch/tilt settings are a little different from original ( not as sensitive) took our family several tries after reaching the mine cart to stay in the game.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Why do u hlguys take soooo long to update the game that has brought u the most sales? cmon u guys r &quot;smart&quot; so get these updates out quicker because this is just rediculous
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is finally here. I love the graphics and the 1big demon monkey.  Imangi Studios did a phenomenal job. More addicting than the first one.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Well done!  A real delight to watch.  I am a sci-fi fan and this one kept my interest all the way through.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|It seems Dr. Alexander has fallen prey to the same hallucinations as those people he previously disbelieved.  His own brain, in near death conditions, experienced illusions that he believes were somehow proof of after-life.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|When I ordered Safe Haven for my kindle I thaought it mostly geared for women.  It is but I thouroghly enjoyed it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! You can spend quite a bit of time on it trying to figure out how to get from point A to B without any crossovers for other colors.  Quite challenging as you get higher up.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The only real complaint is that you never have a chance to really get behind any main character.  Two more words were needed at the end of my 1 sentence review, so this particular sentence can be ignored.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book!  It's even better than the first one (although I found some typographical errors that the editor did not catch.)  Looking forward to the 3rd one with great anticipation.  I recommend this book for teens and adults.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I personally think this one is better than the first temple run. Although it may be a little harder than the first one, the sequel is a lot more intresting. Its one of those games that is very addicting. I recommend to download this game!
0345529057|5.0|The books were in perfect condition when they arrived (no pages missing or anything). With regards to the series itself, it's one of the best you'll ever read!
B000089RV6|5.0|Back In Black is a landmark in rock music and one of the best albums of the '80s. After the death of Bon Scott in early 1980, they decided to go on and got a new lead singer. Brian Johnson was the new vocalist for the band and his first effort even surpasses the Bon Scott era. I prefer his voice over Bon Scott and the thing is, he sounds a lot similar also. Music was changing as the '80s just began, Back In Black was released in the summer of '80. Music style was changing after the late '70s, Back In Black changed rock music. It includes their classic track \\"You Shook Me All Not Long\\" and the follow up, smash hit \\"Back In Black\\" title track. There's many other hits also like \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"Have A Drink On Me\\", \\"Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\". Why would you need a greatest hits album while Back In Black already their best hits. If you were going to buy only one AC/DC album, this would be the right one (although I consider \\"Highway To Hell\\" essential too).
B004AYCWY4|5.0|The book was in perfect condition when it arrived, and its content is both beautiful and informative. Absolutely a must-read!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Very engaging read, can't put it down would recommend to anyone who loves fantasy. Full of interesting plot twists and entertaining, interesting characters, be warned it's very easy to get lost in its pages.
0618680004|5.0|The book was in perfect condition when it arrived. It's a brilliant piece written by one of the most brilliant minds in today's society.
B0018CMJSU|4.0|was looking for the directors cut version of these movies and this is not it - well done anyway and we enjoyed but not what I was actually looking for.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|This is a 99 cent novel.  It can be tedious, but overall it is funny with techno explanations of his attempts to survive on Mars with without communication or enough oxygen and food to survive.  It takes him through many \\"MacGyver\\"moments (a late 80's TV show) where he must use technology's most unusual, often broken and just plain silly schemes to survive.  This could have been a very boring book, but the character's attitude made the read enjoyable.  As with may inexpensive novels, the ending is a throwaway and disappointing.  It is amazing that many authors write over 300+ pages and then dash out a closing that adds nothing to the story.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A fun book, has enough twists &  turns to hold your interest from beginning to end, a quick one day read.
B008P9M614|5.0|House is a great show.  I watched it all along, but missed a few crucial episodes that were shifted due to football.  Now I can catch up with the shows I missed and fill in the over-arching story line.  I think this show could have gone for several more years.
B00846REIS|3.0|Though I believe the writing is better but the story moves slower for me... Fun read none the less... I will read the next book though
B00004T9UF|5.0|Very good product, quality and finish.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
B005LAIIQC|4.0|I thought this was a very good movie in line with the other Bourne titles.. For some reason I had nothing but trouble with this Blu-ray.. It took forever to load(several minutes), when it finally did it runs you through 10 minutes of bs screens and finally during the movie I paused it briefly and after 45 seconds it cut to a universal screensaver which I was unable to back out of by re-hitting pause or play.  I was forced to hit stop and reload the movie for  another 15 minutes.. Needless to say my friends and I were frustrated.. I have a new and updated Samsung player and have never had trouble in the past.. This is just a friendly warning to allot more time than you think you'll need to watch this and hurry up in the bathroom.. Good luck!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this app, however, the ads are very irritating. I was very surprised to encounter ' commercials ' on my kindle. I don't feel these ads will prompt me to purchase the target products.  Other than the ads its a great little app.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book is more for a younger reader, and doesn't really get interesting until the end.  The ending was as it should be.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|great game but PLEASE fix the crash bug on kindle fire. I cant play the game anymore because it just crashes before it gets to the menu.
B005J7K964|4.0|Great movie, one of the best sci-fi history. But the Blu-Ray disc doesn't have spanish subtitles, announced on Product Details.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a whole lot of fun!!! This is app is awesome for anyone and it is free! I rated this app 5 stars! I love it get it
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is the best game!! Much better than Temple run 1!!! I luv the new green gems!!OMG!!!! Epic! one problem, I try 2 turn and it makes me jump off the edge!!  :( but I luv the rest of the game! U should totally get this app! Ah-amazing!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|There is a lot more action and stuff in temple run 2. Mine cars,hills,zip lines,and more!!! I love this game that's why I rated it 5 stars!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I watch and eventually buy alot of movies.  This one isn't worth buying, rent it from somewhere cheap, so you can return it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Way better than the first one,I like the mines and all the different twists and turns, way better than just running straight paths and turning
B000IZA9PI|5.0|I'm a diehard Trekkie. I had seen this movie since it came out, so I got to enjoy it all over again as if it were the first time. this was the end of  Star Trek Marathon for me.I watched the complete original series, Deep Space 9, Voyager, The Next Generation, and all the NG movies over a two or three month period. I'm taking a break before I start on the movies with the original cast. I haven't decided aobut watching the prequel. I always found it boring.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Though I was born long after the 50's and could not feel the nostalgia that my parents did on their reading, I still felt that I could taste that root beer and cough through the haze of smoke that permeated from every building.  If you love Stephen King, time travel paradoxes or just want a vivid and detailed look at America from olden times this is a must read.<br /><br />This man has so much going on his imagination that I am sure that even once he dies his old typewriter will continue to click away on his next epic.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|As a doctor, I appreciate his scientific background and explanations to solidify the reality of his near-death experience. Maybe those who believe like he did before this event can open their minds to the amazing world that awaits after our spirits leave our bodies. It's too bad it took such a drastic illness for him to realize what he should have seen in others' NDEs. I don't quite agree with a couple of points he made about the afterlife; hence, the four stars. Otherwise, I loved how he wove everything together to tell his story.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This is my first meeting with David Mitchell.  I was sold on the idea after seeing the trailer for the movie and wanted to know what I was getting into.  The nested doll technique used to tell the story had me racing through it as quickly as possible.  This is a mistake since the varying writing styles (going along with the time period) makes it easy to skip over key details.<br /><br />A tale of reincarnation... not of people, but of concepts and ideas.  This didn't really come into focus until I reached the end, which made me go back and piece together everything I had missed.  Take your time, use your highlighting feature and take notes.  It is worth it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing and so convenient to enjoy in my PJs or anytime that's convenient for me. Most cost effective, too. Thanks!
0062082353|5.0|i could not put the book down. The flow of the book is a little rough because they sniper is not an author but it will hold your attention
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So much more fun than the old game.  And u have to  be quick! Have no trouble with the game at all.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is soooooo much fun!  Its one great app that never gets old, and the challenge is still there!
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|I'm pretty much always going to love Bad Religion's stuff, no matter what.  But my initial reaction upon first listening to the entire \\"True North\\" album was disappointment.  Not much sophistication, a lot of tired old licks (the \\"running the pick up the string\\" gag for starting a song is now making its at least third appearance), drumming frenetic and accomplished but lacking in variety.  Seemed too old-school, didn't incorporate enough of the more main-stream vibes present in the past four or so albums.<br /><br />But now, after about five listens.  Worst. Ear-worms. Ever.  By which I mean, the best.  \\"Dharma and the Bomb,\\" \\"F You,\\" \\"Hello Cruel World,\\" even the blistering punk jingle \\"Vanity,\\" are stuck in my head as firmly as a campfire song or kindergarten anthem.  The very lack of sophistication I initially reacted negatively to has proved to be among \\"True North's\\" strongest selling points, because it gives the songs a welcomed tribal accessibility that ushers them into the reptile brain and bids them keep house.  That's crazy fast from \\"meh\\" to \\"oh, I get it\\" for me, and I bet other fans have a similar response.<br /><br />Lyrically, Graffin keeps me off balance and engaged with witty plays on words (it's hard for me not to imagine that the word \\"bikini\\" in \\"Dharma and the Bomb\\" doesn't refer to the Bikini Islands, where the atomic bomb was tested), straightforward expressions (there's not much mistaking what \\"F You\\" is saying), impressionistic stream-of-consciousness, and helpful vocabulary builders like \\"revenant\\" and \\"precariat.\\"<br /><br />If, as was largely true for me, you find that your first reaction to \\"True North\\" is to think, \\"I'm pretty sure this is a reissue of songs first recorded in the 80s,\\" don't give up.  The magic is not instantaneous, but it is fast.  I haven't been in a mosh pit for quite some time now, being pretty close the age of the guys in BR.  But by now, I'm thinking I might have to start preparing for one, because there's no waythese songs don't make you want to swim those primeval tidewaters.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't normally write reviews but this was excellent. Original with many surprises. I can't wait for more in this series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My granddaughter and I love this new version of temple run.  We like the zip lines and the graphics are cool and I find them a little easier to see clearly.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I've read a number of his books and they never fail to keep me on the edge of my seat and turning pages as quickly as possible to see what comes next.<br /><br />This book was not like that.  It was a completely different format and story line.  It took a long time to get to the meat of the story so I could figure out what was really going on .  In the end, there were a lot of holes in the story line.  Normally I give his books a 5-star rating, but not this one.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It crashes sometimes and sometimes laggy but over all its a really cool app. Great graphics too. I say get it!!!!!!!!
B000FVE3A2|5.0|I just love this Grand Diver, it's not HEAVY to me but for some smaller folks it's maybe to heavy for them.  It fit my wrist just fine.  Great price point for a automatic watch this big.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great application but it keeps bringing me to my home screen when I click the Save Me button. Please fix this problem so I can save myself when I die. :-/
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|This is my second invicta lefty watch.  I get more complements than the first on this watch.  The watch is my awesome, the canvas band it not the best choice but that can be changed.  I need more invicta's.  Great watch for a even better price.
0143038095|4.0|This book has many different stories that weave together throughtout it, connecting several families. The first story is about Suyuan and Jing-Mei. After Suyuan died, her daughter Jing-Mei traveled to China to find her long-lost half sisters to tell them about their birth mother. Her main conflict is internal because she feels as if she barely knows her mother herself and struggles with it. Her story builds as people discourage her to go because they think people will know she is American and not Chinese. Another story focuses on Lindo, Taitai, and Waverly. When Lindo got engaged to her boyfriend, she felt as if her mother, Taitai, did not approve. Lindo gave birth to a child of her own, Waverly, and forced her to compete in chess matches and practice non-stop. The conflict in this part of the story is man vs. man because Lindo forces Waverly to be a part of something she does not like and it causes problems in their relationship. Waverly decides to purposely miss her chess match and temporarily quit playing chess to teach her mother a lesson. Ying-Ying, Clifford, and Lena are the focus of another story. Ying-Ying met Clifford, a man of English-Irish desent, and gave brith to Lena. Once she was older Lena had to translate for her mother, considiring she only knew Mandarin. The main conflict in this part of the story is internal because Ying-Ying cannot communicate with others well, and fights herself because of it. The last story is about An-Mei, Rose, and Ted. An-Mei's daughter, Rose, was married to Ted. When he asked for a divorce, she thought it was fate for them to be together but eventually realized it was not. The conflict in this story is man vs. man because their parents do not approve of their marriage, and because later they are getting a divorce. Rose refused to sign the divorce papers because Ted wanted to keep the house since he found himself another woman.<br /> Overall I liked this book. I enjoyed how the author went into background history for each of the families before going into detail about their story. I also liked that it was based many years ago but I can still relate to it now. Another thing I really about this story was the strength that some of the characters showed. I would definitely recommend this book. This book taught me lessons about life and fate. It was understandable and relatable which made it really fun to read.
B003INBOE2|5.0|This is the guy that taught Bruce Lee, so you. know he had to be one of the  best in the world.

B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is by far a really great movie with a great actor by the name of Tom Hanks.  The story is pretty basic and no matter how many times I have seen this movie I have yet to get tired of watching it, because I enjoy the acting job Hanks preformes in it plus all the great music from they used to make the movie come alive during the whole 70's.  I watched the bonus features long time ago but anyone intrested in how the movie come about made the specials very intresting main thing being how they did the special effects inculding how the legless man scenes were filmed.  I personally enjoy the movie for the history lessons within the movie helps me remeber what happened in the past and being a history major in college I enjoy mutiple history lessons and topics.  But every actor did a great job in the movie and made the movie so much more believable.  I think most people already own this movie if not then defently buy this movie not just for the amazing acting job Hanks does for the storyline and character but also the great soundtrack it has from the 70's.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun and I love horses. if you love horses you have to buy this app! this game is awesome!

B003WUYRGI|5.0|The ratings was good. I don't really care about  dictionary but it has the meaning of words so it must be a good dictionary. (If it has the right meanings of the words it is good) I guess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008FSCNTK|5.0|This latest release from Diana Krall is a departure from her other music but it is exceptionally good.  Diana Krall is a fascinating singer and piano player.  I hope she continues to produce beautiful music.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Puzzle game with increasing difficulty.  Love solving and then going back and matching the minimum steps.  Not wild about the mellow muzak but not irritated enough to turn it off.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I finished this in casual mode pretty fast. Gonna try to bump it up for more of a challenge. It was worth paying for. Warning, don't play this alone in the dark. I had the ish scared out of me a few times lol

B009ZM76J2|4.0|From time to time one wants to watch a movie that tells a historic narrative. We become better citizens of the Universe as we attempt to learn from past injustices.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome. I started to get board of the first one so I started playing games like subway surf. when my brother told me about temple run 2. I was thrilled. this game is awesome. I love that you van come back to life if you have gems.  I especially love the mind carts there fun. I wonder if they can make a 3rd I cant even imagine that would be awesome.
B002CIY8EM|2.0|Only 10% of content is interesting, the rest is author’s logical reasoning and thinking. Not worth reading. Interesting that author sound much more interesting on history channel. His book is not interesting to read.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|After having seen \\"Americas Band\\" in person on their 50th Anniversary Tour, I bought this DVD to keep reminding me of that special evening. While it was edited down a great deal, it served that purpose
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a great collection of soothing sounds to help you relax or drift off to sleep. I especially like the range of water sounds. Used it as background mood when my wife and I gave each other massages. Felt like we were at the spa!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is way better than the regular one you should totally get it . I hope this was helpful!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game but I had one upset it crashed and I cant play it. but the graphics are beautiful after you go to settings and set it for best quality. I would suggest it to you but I warned you about the crashing.
0439023513|5.0|When I wanted this my daughter was on the first book &#34;Hunger Games&#34;.  I wanted to give her this for Christmas.  Although I ordered well in advance.  You guys delivered as promised and even though my daughter was cranking through these books... I was able to give her an early Christmas present since you delivered as expected.  Thanks and take care.
B00316DDUE|5.0|This Blu-ray  concert is awesome.  The picture and sound quality is beyond excellent.  After renting concert from library, I had to order my own copy.  This was the first Yanni concert I have ever watched, and now I'm hooked.  The music and the talent of these musicians are unbelievable.  One of the most exhilarating  concert I have ever watched on DVD.
B004VDSWQ6|5.0|La calidad de imagen es increíble, el sonido también. Altamente recomendable para los seguidores de DIO y los que recién se están haciendo seguidores.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|like the large numbers to make it easy read,and it is simple to use suggest anyone should download it injoy
B0079M8R6Q|5.0|This guy grew up in a truly appalling environment that belongs in a Conan movie or something rather than in the 21st century.<br /><br />If he didn't escape it would be too depressing but as it is, it is a great unputdownable yarn.<br /><br />If you like prison stories, survival against the odds and escape stories there will be something here for you.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I bought this game and have tried to download it several times.I wish I had read the reviews better. it said that the download took a long time but it would quit even trying after about 10minutes. I really wanted to play this game.but I lost my money..maybe this review will save some one else from losing theirs.
B0099Y2YL6|3.0|When this series started it quickly earned a well deserved reputation for a new style of period drama. It's success however has been it's undoing as the urge to keep it going long past its sell-by-date is leading it headlong down the slippery slope of ever more boring soap! This is most evident in the final \\"Trip to the Highlands\\" and for me it is rapidly losing its appeal despite looking better on Blu. Even the cast are fed up with it and are having to be eliminated in improbable story line twists as they say enough is enough! It is time to bring it to an end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is very fun the best part about this game is when you get to compete. the worst thing is when the horse gets tired.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was great. I absolutely loved it. I think everyone should read it. This is a book that you simply can't put down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game ever I don't think I have ever played a game like it you make up your own name and horses name
B005DOL0R0|5.0|felt this was suitable for my needs. has enough cushioning to protect it if it is dropped. grandchildren will be using it.
B005LAII80|5.0|I saw this in the theater and own this on blu ray a shame I don't own a 3D Tv cause the special effects were awesome. For those comparing it to Raid I hate to be the one to tell you this Dredd was written in 2006 filmed in 2010 and has been in post production hell and shopped around  to get a distributor but non the less it's a kick ass movie from start to finish.<br /><br />Buy this movie so they can make the sequels!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it's great. I like it but is more challenging than temple run 1 in some ways. I really recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its str8...it str8 ^ p go in fasum.. it betta den da first. !! ya feel mee foo but ya #cartel
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is one of those ones that even before you take it out of the box you can feel it's going to please.  This knife is one that can take anything you deal out to it and still be hungry for more.  Buy it if you love the outdoors or if you really need a knife for the jobs you will be preforming because trust me it is well worth the buy.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|George Harrison and Martin Scorsese?  Fabulous combination!  I really miss him.  Have a nice day.  I thought this was MY review!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The continuation of the Hunger Games does not disappoint. Just as in the first book the story makes you keep turning pages to find out what is coming next. And the surprises keep coming! So looking forward to the third & final chapter!!!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I've been looking for real science fiction for a while.  This is it. Read this book. The writing is fantastic. The plot is great. The story is completely believable.
0143039504|5.0|The books is in excellent condition and I am very happy with it. Price was awesome and you could not find a better deal. Shipping was also very fast.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|looooove this game!!!! BEST HORSE LOVER APP EVERRR!!! if you love horses... you WILL ADORE this game!!! PROMISE!!! &lt;3 I haven't stopped playing since I downloaded it- and it's FREEEE :)
B009GIPDQS|4.0|I loved the story and didn't want to put it down. I really liked the twists and turns and never lost interest in the characters. I would highly recommended it to other readers
B008IJT0CE|4.0|its not bad, if u have disposable income and can afford th $3 for this item cost, which equates to 7,000 chinese man hours which allows me to enjoy the rain while chinese enjoy whips!
B006LSZECO|5.0|An excellent psychological thriller, plenty of twists and turns.  Hard to put down, had to find out what happened next.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Nice update from the first version. Love the new landscapes. I do find jumping to get the medallions &amp; jewels harder in this one, though.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A very touching teenage love story.  The characters were multidimensional as they dealt with the very difficult subject of childhood cancer and life changing experiences.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it very good better than the first one more thing to do than just running you can even swing from a rope .
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I love this book! It is awesomely awesome. One of the best books ever. I am so reading the second book.
B002C949KE|3.0|I enjoy these types of books but they are getting a bit redundant. There are some worthwhile observations here but not enough to make an entire book from. Many topics have been covered through other writers in this genre.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As awesome as the first . Can't wait to devour the 3rd . Happy reading to all who are lucky enough to buy these books
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I watched this because it's about music and how it touches many people.  But this movie is about more than the music, it's about some remarkable human beings, leading ordinary lives and doing extraordinary things.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this film.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is a fun free-mium game, but I would never spend any real money for the extras. Pretty standard hidden item game.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is a book that made me feel awake and gave me seasons to stay awake. If you are looking for simple things that will increase your awareness and presence this is the most appropriate book.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Very slow start...I'm talking about an hour to get going, the last half an hour kind of made it worth the wait.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I highly recommend it to others. Its a heavy subject but written in a compassionate, approachable manner. It would be a great read for a book club or just reading on your own, as I did. There's a lot to think about. But what I appreciated most was while you felt sorry for Alice and her family living with her diagnosis, you did not feel Alice was a defeated character or came away from the book thoroughly depressed. I felt I had a better idea of what people and their family's diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer's are confronted with. It definitely reminds you what is important in life and to enjoy every moment!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Just finished reading The Last Man, the latest Mitch Rapp book.  It was great as usual.  All of the books in this series have been great reads.  I am looking forward to the next book in the series.  I don't feel I need to write paragraphs and go into what the book is about, that's why you read it.  Flynn is a great author.  The one thing he doesn't do thankfully, like some authors, is go into painful descriptions of everything down to the type of granite countertops in the kitchen or the weave pattern in the curtains!!!  He tells you just what you need to know.
B0093QHW7G|5.0|Okay. I love the Beatles and I especially love George Harrison. From my perspective, as a guitarist Harrison has always been underrated.<br /><br />The movie for me was as if you were watching the evolution of Harrison from being caught up in being part of the Beatles where they all seemed to be just taken along for the ride. They just seemed to follow things where those things took them.<br /><br />He then goes into his next phase where he was trying to find himself as an individual and as a musician. What comes across is Harrison's love of music and wanting to play music. What comes across is his desire to simply get together with others to CREATE.<br /><br />About this same time, it goes into Harrison's search for life. I thought that this was all handled very well. To me, it seemed more as if they were simply reporting it as part of him as opposed to getting preachy about the effect all of this was having on him and his life. About the same way they would have reported that he had decided to get a tattoo.<br /><br />I don't know if it's true, or simply my interpretation, but some of the parts discussing the break up of the Beatles seemed to focus on Harrison simply getting to the point where he felt that he was no longer developing as a musician. He was being dragged along by primarily Paul McCartney and simply asking Paul, &#34;What do you want me to do musically here?&#34;<br /><br />There's not a lot of focus on that part of his life.<br /><br />If you appreciate movies about musicians and their real lives. I think you'll find this interesting.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|My favorite book by my favorite author.  I've lost track of how many times I've read &#34;Emma,&#34; but Kindle is cetainly a great way to have it with me, always.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Very addicting game, trying to beat it on OCD very hard.  love it very unique.  Amazon was offering for free when I got it for my tablet already owned it for the PC.
B00A4TKDKY|3.0|I love Buddy Guy,&  have been waiting for a live cd. First of all there is way too much talking, too<br />much cussing & not enough playing.<br />Poor song selection & should have been a 2cd set, still love him but dispointed in this cd.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very similar to movie, Zero Dark Thirty, which was a very interesting portrayal of the events surrounding Bin Laden's murder.  Captivating. Well written.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Much better watching the saga this way without commercials and constraints of weekly time slots.  Since the current season 3 is already available via DVD, we will get it and plan out our marathons of watching this great series from beginning to end with the ability to review past segments when questions pop up.  Cost is only a little more than Spiderman DVD but the quality movie/TV viewing is a tremendous value in comparison.
030746363X|4.0|This is one thick book and it's packed with information.  Data geeks rejoice-- if you are the type of person who tracks their weight on a spreadsheet or makes a Pareto chart of their meals, Tim Ferriss is a kindred spirit.<br /><br />For me, even from the sections I was interested in, I only needed 50% of the information presented.<br /><br />But the information I did use (fat loss and sleep) is WELL worth the price of the book.  The slow carb diet is not only very effective, but sustainable.  If you know how to cook and can add variety to the food plan, you will be well happy with the fat loss and lack of hunger.  I have to remind myself to eat.  8 pounds down in two weeks with no exercise.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Way too long with far too many meaningless battle scenes at the expense of the timeless story.  Great photography and sound design!  Still, worth the HD rental.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|a good read becuse E.L. James is a great writer.. Didn't really like the story line but was very well written. It was my first read of the 50 shades books.. i'll pass on the rest.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's fun but has too many ads. They pop up any time I go somewhere. I don't want to buy those things. I wish they didn't pop up at all. I was in the middle of a tournament and an ad popped up. GRR....
006056251X|5.0|After reading book 2, It happened one autumn, I thought Sebastian St. Vincent was just scum. I didn't think it was possible to redeem him after what he did to Lillian Bowman-Westcliffe. But obviously I forgot I was dealing with a master storyteller and Lisa Kleypas didn't disappoint. I know now not to doubt her because all I can say is Bravo, Ms. Kleypas, Bravo!<br /><br />This one picked up right after book 2 ended. Sebastian St. Vincent was home nursing his bruises after his old friend Westcliffe gave him a beatdown. Evangeline \\"Evie\\" Jenner shows up and offers him a deal he can't refuse. Marry her and her fortune will be his. Evie basically exchanged her fortune for her freedom from her cousins. The journey to Gretna Green beings stripping off a layer from both Sebastian and Evie, exposing the \\"lazy, aimless rake\\" as much more than he pretends to be, AND showing the \\"quiet, stuttering mouse\\" has much more fortitude than anyone realized.<br /><br />What amazes me about Lisa Kleypas and this series is that no one H/h journey is quite the same. She may bring characters from prior books, but the individual story and road to HEA is unique to that couple. While I had hoped for a more drawn out fight with Evie's cousin, I had to admit that would been a predictable villain and storyline. Another great story and great installment to the Wallflower series<br /><br />***Evangeline Jenner is Ivo Jenner's daughter from book \\"Dreaming of You\\". He owned the rival club to Craven's club (Derek Craven's club). Nice way to connect the series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temmple run 2 is way better than the first one! I love it so much!!!!! I'm so addicted to this game!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These are more than likely my favorite set of books. I couldn't have thought of a happier ending. Love it!
B000TCEU4Q|4.0|If you use X-Plane (9 or 10), there is little  choice as to Flight Controls, but to purchase this item unless you go for the $$,$$$.$$ home simulators. That said, the Saitek Quadrant being the only choice, does prove to be a winner. I removed one star solely for the cheaper, less expensive materials used as compared to the Hotas Warthog which is a total different animal.<br /><br />Pros<br />stylish, better asthetics (in my opinion only) than the competing brand<br />turns your flying experiance into a more realistic feeling, not using keyboard for those functions<br />easy to set up, configurable colored knobs, programmable button array and lever functions within either software or flight sim<br />not expensive<br /><br />IT WORKS!  Cons<br />construction could be better<br /><br />Also, be carefull not to allow liquids (coffee ect. such as me) into the slots. I have been using the original Saitek Flight Pro for years and only had to replace the quadrant due to my mishap of spilt coffee. The replacement was even more accurate than the original but the detents on all three levers were hardly there. I do not think this would pertain to all of these devices, could RMA for another but am happy as it is. Yes, I am very picky about my purchases and am willing to pay for what<br />I get, but it better be good. This is good. Amazon is terrific, in customer support (of which I rarely had to use throughout the years), their newest or older merchandise selection (if its sold, they have it), and their pricing. I must mention the shipping is awesome. Even with the free shipping option, the item arrives  (in my own experiance) in express time. Not to mention the Amazon Prime which is also somthing for all to consider. No, I do not work for them, I am just a 100% satisfied hi-tech person.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|the app is cool. not as sensitive as temple run 1. on my kindle fire I played it for a few times but then it wouldn't work. I keep having to install and re-install it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|fun upgraded app bit different frm the original one. very entertaining &amp; alil more difficult but very addictive  has u playing for more:)
B005I4JG80|5.0|If you only read one pregnant/parenting book, this is a pretty good choice. Easy read. Interesting perspective. A nice contrast to the usual child-rearing hysteria.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Everyone should have this in his/her Christmas movie collection! One of the few movies that is truly timeless. Get it before they ban it!
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|A Wonderful Holiday Movie for all Ages ... Great Animation..HeartWarming Story. Will Be a Classic for Years to Come !!

B008F5YDRI|4.0|Very cute movie.  I thought it was very entertaining and fun to watch.I would recommend it to anyone.  Nice, but rather slow.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would have never thought I would enjoy a TV series about snooty Old England, but I must say, my Wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed this one. I found myself telling the Characters what they should do, and laughing out loud at something Mr. Carson, or perhaps something Lady Mary would say. I openly cried when (warning spoiler!).....<br /><br />Lady Sybil died....(Jessica Brown Findley, the actress who played Lady Sybil is a classic Beauty. Don't you think?).<br />  Anyway, I don't think I could praise a series any higher. Well written, with wonderful Characters, it really draws you into the story, and makes you think about how the old system worked there in England. I think it also helps me realize why my ancestors left. I doubt they ever 'were in service', but the class divisions were strongly defined, with little or no chance for the 'common man' to elevate himself. I don't know details, other than the left Ireland some five generations ago...but there must have been compelling reasons, and that may have been one of them.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am completely addicted to this series, and love to be able to watch it at my leisure.  Looking forward to Season 3!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|similar to myst, this is a fun little adventure game. took less than a day to beat it, hoping for more games like it. also recommend lost city, grisly manor, and crimson manor.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Really enjoy keeping an eye on the weather for different family and travel locations!  Wish the forecasted daily hi/low appeared on the locations page though.  Only find it under the 36 hour forecast tab?
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Cassandra Clare's second book in the Mortal Instruments series continues where book 1 stopped. It hooked me in from the first page. I couldn't wait to find out what Clary, Jace, and Simon would get into next!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Fun game to stay connected with friends and family away from home.  Reminds me of Pictionary around the kitchen table!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Starts slow but then hooks the reader. Once I was hooked I couldn't put it down! Highly recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am loveing this game and it is really fun. I would recamend this game to anyone that loves animals
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This edition is a lovely colorized verion of the original 1947 movie with heartwarming performances by Natalie Wood, Edmund Gwenn (as Santa Claus), Maureen O'Hara, and John Payne. There are fine character performances by the supporting cast, which includes William Frawley from &#34;I Love Lucy.&#34; The trial of Santa Claus has touches of humor and &#34;flawless&#34; legal logic which brings the movie to a fun and uplifting ending. No other version of this film has quite the same charm as the original. A great film for children and adults alike to get everyone into the Christmas spirit!
B000VSAEYI|5.0|My little one loved this during Summer!!! The palm tree offered just enough shade for her little self, and she had so much fun learning how to use the slide. Its very large for us to sit in with her, and great quality.
B00APUQH0W|1.0|This is the second HD movie I have downloaded from Amazon that had inferior video quality. The video was grainy and blurred. Not even as good as SD.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was filled with drama from beginning to end. I loved the suspense of not knowing if Abby and Travis were going to get back together. Can't wait for the second book to come out.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Except for a few funny lines this movie was terrible. Save your money and time and see something another movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|When I got to the end of the first book I just could not wait to get started on this one! It did not let me down. Such a great series. Really keeps your interest from the first page to the last!
B00433TO52|1.0|I am entering my disgust with the kindle version just to add another 1 star review.  I was misled by reviews of the paper version and did not realize that the kindle version is unusable until I bought it.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I love Mahjong on the computer so I figured I would get it on my Kindle.  I find the tiles are too small for me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A very well written story. Something for everyone and keeps the readers interest from beginning to end. You won't go wrong buying and reading this one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a game that I both love and hate!  It is fun to play.  I like to play the hardest level and am frequently stumped.  I have to start over again many times on some of the puzzles. Some I have been unable to solve.  The beginner levels are enjoyed by my 7 year old grandson.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The reviews are so right! Its a must see that I can't get enough of! Wonderfully acted and great writing!!

B007VGXS8M|2.0|I tried several times to play and did not enjoy it.  The first few levels were fine, then they threw in all sorts of crazy things like sand blowing across the scene and it became less enjoyable.  Never play it anymore
B007A6XLDU|5.0|I like the features this program offers.  I have been using it for 6 months now.  I especially like being able to convert jpeg to pdf .
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|It was so boring.  Just use a flip to arch a bird into a pile of blocks. So 70' s.
B009DT424Y|3.0|I give it a three, because it actually did send my voice to the speakers, but I found it confusing to decide what level of sound it was set at. I got an echo, which I decided that was because I was too close to the speakers or the sound level was turned up too high.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|spicy but also profound .You really don,t know how far you will go to be in the life of another and to get to know yourself.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Love this game. This puts me at ease and its good for down time, puzzles gradually get difficult and it has a choice of settings
B008XX6J4C|5.0|All five of The Piano Guys are immensely talented and this CD shows off their musical creativity and sensitivity. You miss out on the beautiful music videos but listening to their classical-ized arrangements of pop music is great too. Peponi (Paradise) and Over the Rainbow/Simple Gifts are two of my favorite tracks because of how they transformed the well known pop songs into something new and beautiful.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|An amazing concert from start to finish and normally would not be something I thought I would like. John Mayer is an amazing muscian, electrifying and captivating. Have it in my  BluRay player and have been watching several tracks daily for several weeks since it arrived, gives me a small dose of enjoyment everyday everyday.  The best concert recording I have ever watched.  Buy the BluRay version if you have surround, but DVD is wonderful.  Get a copy.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Best show on tv since Mad Men.  Perhaps a little better than MM.  Once I started watching, I could not stop.  Extremely well written and directed.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this game a lot but I hate that you need to have a Facebook account to be able to complete any of the levels.  There are many aspects to this game that you need to be logged into Facebook to be able to do.  Not everyone wants to be on Facebook!!

B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel grabs you by the throat and doesn't let you go.  No spoilers here, but I can't say I liked the ending.  I always think novelists have a deadline to meet and they can't quite bring it around.......
B00ABXA1HI|3.0|I used this app on a Nexus7 and my home PC which has two monitors. The app works fine until you switch between monitors. Switching will cause the app to sometime crash and sometimes re-arrange all the icons on your desktop. So beware. This app still needs some work.

B008H6GH8I|4.0|Resident Evil: Degeneration and Damnation both average 4 stars on Amazon and Degeneration is cheaper so you might as well get Degeneration, correct? Wrong. Regardless of the Amazon ratings Damnation is a significant improvement over Capcom's previous effort and one of the best movie translations of a video game ever. It's certainly better than the live action movies which have almost nothing to do with the video games they claim to be based off of<br /><br />Damnation feels more like the natural successor to RE 4 than Degeneration with the viral infection being Plagas rather than the G/T-Virus. Leon Kennedy finds himself embroiled in an uprising in an eastern European country. In a desperate move the insurgents have resorted to using BOW's in their fight having managed to gain technology that allows them to control the usually uncontrollable horrors. After nearly being killed by a Licker, Leon is captured by a trio of insurgents who believe him to be a CIA agent. At the same time the Plagas is starting to spread and things are quickly going to Hell.<br /><br />The CGI is much better in Damnation, in particular the facial modeling. Degeneration had this weird plastic look to the faces but here they are much more expressive. Leon still has a perpetual glare, unlike in the video games, but at least he's shown to be capable of other expressions. The backgrounds are gorgeous bordering on photorealistic. The CGI still lags behind the top American studios particularly in character movement. There is a fight between Ada Wong and one of the main antagonists that is very stiff and robotic. American studios have done an amazing job of making movements feel natural and organic and there is definitely room for improvement here but for a movie that didn't even get a theatrical release in the U.S. this is very good stuff and a huge improvement over Degeneration.<br /><br />One of my big issues with Degeneration was the lack of variety in BOW's (bio-organic weapons). I counted two including zombies and the inevitable G-Virus final boss. Damnation ups the count with a whopping three BOW types including the Licker, Plagas zombies and Tyrant. Seriously Capcom, there are dozens and dozens of BOW's and all you include are three? Another thing is that although the tyrants look visually stunning they don't really look like Tyrants or even organisms from Resident Evil. They look more like giant blue aliens. Another problem I have is with Leon Kennedy's bizarre lack of inner monologue. At one point he comes across a CIA contact named Scarecrow who's been beaten near death. Initially Scarecrow can only utter a gurgle prompting Leon to turn his head and mutter, `I guess scarecrows aren't known for their rousing conversation'. Seriously? You say that to a man near death who's seconds away from being ripped to shreds? In another instance Leon is flung by a Tyrant 30 feet into a marble pillar (a move that should have killed or permanently incapacitated Leon). Leon drags himself up saying, `You really shouldn't have done that' Leon had nothing to back up his boast and looks silly with his empty hubris. These goofy lines are all though the movie and I'm not sure if this is an accurate translation or just some weak dubbing.<br /><br />Lastly the ending here is pretty cheap but in the end Damnation has better characterization, a better storyline and better CGI than Degeneration. Let me also add that many of the scene backgrounds look like they were ripped right from the games so it really feels like the movie is in the same universe as the games. I have seen so many game translations that felt like the creators wanted to make anything other than a video game movie. I'm not sure why it's so hard to set a movie in the same universe as the game but Capcom pulls it off. Hopefully this is just the next installment in a long line of movies that continue to improve.including zombies and the inevitable G-Virus final boss.

B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is a classic written by a great author.  In the past I have given this book as a gift to friends.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoy temple run2 anyone can learn how to play my brother likes it too that is why I enjoy temple run2.
1451695187|5.0|A very good book, and found the Author's ,experience very uplifiting, and very spiritual. I recommend it for everyone to read..
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Story undeveloped, violence senseless, no direction. I was waiting till the end of the movie for it to improve. It didn't. Most unfortunately, you had to wait till the end to find out one small piece of the puzzle, the rest was mishmash.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it.  Shipment was fast and I would def rec this movie for all ages.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I had forgotten that Steve Martin was in it. (Ditto Belushi, Candy, & Murray). Moranis was good, but Ellen Green as Audrey (especially singing &#34;Suddenly Seymour&#34;) makes the show.
B001N44BVQ|4.0|DiCaprio, Crowe, and director Ridley Scott are in top form with this story of espionage, suicide bombers, and the intricate webs woven by all involved. The casualties of war in various forms are shown throughout the story.  Be aware that some scenes are hard to watch due to human suffering, but that is one of the costs of these wars.
1416583432|5.0|As a therapist for humans, I worried that this book might do the thing to my beloved pets that so many humans worry will happen to them. None one wants their personal mythologies, their idiosyncrasies, their emotions to be reduced to bare science. Some people balk to think their irresistible need to cuddle their loved ones a product of oxytocin or to imagine their hearts to pitter pat when seeing their partner only because of a norepinephrine spurt. I worried learning more about the science of dogs would diminish the richly imagined myths of my furry kids. While reading this book, I've found myself loving them more, watching them more carefully to imagine what they might be seeing or smelling, and trying harder to play the games they like best. And for added benefit, a single sentence in this book has finally stopped all \\"accidents\\" indoors.<br />Several reviews have complained the science may be shoddy. But, in reality, isn't all science only what we've learned to the best of our ability? Much of what we know could be disproven tomorrow by a simple lack of knowledge today. I think this book is pretty thorough, considering how little we know of each other. Even after hours of listening.<br />Now if Ms. Horowitz would only become a cat person....
030758836X|5.0|My name finally came up on the wait list for Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. It has been incredibly popular since it came out in June 2012, and now I know why. I had a very hard time putting it down. The plot is full of suspense and the writing is terrific. Even though I guessed the first \\"big reveal\\" about three chapters in, there were plenty of twists and turns I did not expect. I didn't like either of the main characters, and yet I could not resist reading more about them. I wanted to know what was going to happen next.<br /><br />The day of their fifth wedding anniversary finds Nick at the bar he owns with his sister and his wife Amy at home. He gets a call from a neighbor - his front door is open and the cat is out. Amy never lets the cat out. When Nick races home, he discovers signs of a struggle. The book takes it from there, as chapters alternate between Amy's dated diary entries and Nick's account of his life as he comes increasingly under suspicion.<br /><br />That short description barely scratches the surface of this book. I like character development, and there is plenty of that in Gone Girl, but there's plenty of action too. If you are looking for an engrossing read, I highly recommend this book - just make sure you have plenty of time to read once you start it!
B003ODIZL6|2.0|It gives you a lot of information. Also it doesn't give you paper cuts. And you have to think about what's in the book.

If, as an adult, you continue to prefer Dick and Jane basal readers, then this one is for you. Very disappointing for readers who have enjoyed the Bosch series. Did Connelly write this? If so, was it in 2012? Prose -- couldn't find any, plot -- thin, dialogue -- ugh!, characters -- one maybe interesting one, and ending -- they all fall down.  We've been duped. Here is a once favored author's name to be added to the Beware of Purchase Based on Past Experience pile. All of which, I am sorry to say and sorrier still to have paid for it.

B001ANYDAO|5.0|Challenges foundational ideas about aspects of society many take for granted. Has given me hindsight about my own life, and is encouraging foresight about parenting choices for my kids. Hopefully it will encourage wider social change as well.<br />As always, a fascinating, entertaining, and thought provoking book from Mr.Gladwell.
B000022TSY|5.0|Came fast and was as advertised.  It was for my wife for her birthday and she loves it.  I would def recommend this classic.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|As a fifth grade teacher, I often talk with our kids about time  . . .and how to use what we are given.  Mr. Albom does a marvelous job of making us stop and think about what we have, what we want, and how those two intertwine with the time we have here on earth.  Although I think this book is a bit too young for most fifth grade readers, I could easily see this becoming a classroom novel in one of our upper elementary grades.  This book is a must-read for those who think that our time here is endless; it is not.  And Mitch Albom has written a book that helps us to understand that we are all important, we are all here for a reason, and that time truly waits for no one.
B004EPZ08O|1.0|Unfortunately I can't stop watching these terribly bad movies.  They keep finding new ways to kill people, so you gotta give 'em credit for that.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|have watched this movie several time and it is very enjoyable.  The old type of movie and enjoyable, fun and informative
0316223239|5.0|One of the best books I have every read.  I loved every minute of it.  Very believable; easy to see how any of this could have happened.  Very interesting coming from the viewpoint of a 5-year old.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Enjoyed the story tremendously and want to find more books by MIRA Kelly.  The development of the characters years made the book.
B003UESJHO|5.0|Fast service and just a great movie.  I watched this with my some and we really enjoyed it.  Thanks :)
B000BJ7C6K|5.0|George Harrison goes all out for Bangladesh. George Harrison sounds great doing some Beatle's songs as well as his first solo album, All Things Must pass. The sound quality is very good for a 1971 concert. George Harrison with an allstar lineup. Well worth the money.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game so much!! I cant put it down!!! and it gives me a bit of a HarrybPotter vibe, which makes it 80million times better!! :D
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Love the story, it was suprised by the story, didn't expect it.  I have watched it several times. and will more.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not as good as the first book of the series.  It was sometimes difficult to keep track of what was going on in the story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|But  has I thinnk  that we'll actually It is a super game and has so it rocks and still it rocks
B0042816YK|5.0|The movie came fast and it was great. Who doesn't love Julia?  I would rec this movie to everyone. Thanks
B000UD0ESA|5.0|A must have for Blade Runner Fans. Digitally remastered Directors cut in widescreen format. The Actors do a great job as well.
0425264351|5.0|I was turned onto this by my family who told me Reacher was an all around bad ass and a good simple read. If you like this formula, as I do, guy meets problem, guy kicks problem in the ass, repeat. You will like Reacher.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|watched this movie several time and it makes me laugh.  Well acted and fund to watch.  This is a very good movie
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best! It's my favorite game. It beats the first the first one by far. Temple Run 2 kicks a*s.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I would give it a 5 'cause I love the game but it only let me get on it once when I first got it but it worked perfectly when I did get on it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Each point is concise with visuals that make it easy to correlate to Word. I haven't built my book yet, but this book gave me the confidence that I can.
B004SBX112|5.0|you can spend many hours playing this fun game.  good for all ages . I would recommend it to others
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I did horseriding in my youth and was curious about this APP - high ratings and all. I played it for 45 minutes. Way longer as planned and it is still interesting. It works and is well made. I would love to see more interaction with horse besides stroking and competitions.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|It is a great gift for my daughter and friends.  I am sure it will be well listened to, thanks.
1455523550|5.0|I love Nicholas Spark's books and I think Safe Haven may be one of his best.  I wasn't sure at first, because I just finished the \\"Best of Me\\" and was not impressed at all.  But Safe Haven was just the opposite -- it was a wonderfully written love story with gripping and intense twists along the way.<br /><br />I've seen some of the reviews compare it to the movie, Sleeping with the Enemy.  First of all, I've always felt that movie was bad -- the acting and the storyline were below standard. While this book had some similiarities, that movie is not even in the same ballpark as this book.  Safe Haven blows that movie out of the water.  And, I'm sure once this book becomes a movie (soon) it will be much better than Sleeping with the Enemy.<br /><br />In conclusion, just loved this book.  It was hard to put down and the writing was brilliant.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game! My friend got it and we played it and now I'm totally addictied!!!!! Get it even if you don't like dragons it is one of the best games EVER!!!!!!!!
B007Y1AVV6|5.0|Strangland and Neon river are my favorite. Can not stop listening to this band. Nice background music too. Listening while developing code.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I had this game recommended to me and thought I'd give it a whirl.  It is pretty fun and mentally stimulating, but I found 99% of the puzzles to not be very challenging.  Pretty great for a free app, though.
B00AVTMCYW|1.0|This movie is for losers. The guy has never done anything useful and became hero. Go figure out. Only in Hollywood.
0765325950|4.0|I've read a number of reviews and I thought it was worth adding my 2 cents in case it made the difference in someone purchasing the book.<br /><br />Quite a number of people were dissatisfied mostly with how it felt incomplete.  I felt like it was appropriately ended in that as an epic series it really felt like an epic ending.  That said, there were some big problems with how some of what were seemingly shaping up to be major plot developments just fizzled out by the time the dust settled.  But after going over it in my head a number of times I really can't say that I have any belief that Jordan could have done a better job himself because he was the one that fragmented it this badly to begin with.  I disagree with those who felt Sanderson didn't do the battles as well as Jordan.  I felt Sanderson's writing felt more engaging than any of the battles earlier in the series by Jordan.<br /><br />All that being said, after I finished the book, overall I was quite satisfied with how it ended.  I think the series was done justice on the scale in which it was soaring.  I also believe this was probably the best results anyone could have hoped for based on what there was to work with.  If Sanderson had total free reign with fewer limitations (probably also by TOR) I would suspect the series would have lasted another book just to wrap up the ridiculous number of side stories.<br /><br />I would probably have been more happy if some of the major plot points had just been left out, even leaving readers wondering what happened, and released in single volumes to give it the right amount of attention.  Again, this all had to work within the framework of Jordan's notes, his widow and TOR deciding how long they want to string this along.
0425264351|1.0|I agree with everything the other one star reviewers said.  However, I decided to write a review because I have friends who are big Lee Child fans so I bought the second book in the series, and it is just as unrealistic/bad/etc. as this book so save your money if you didn't like this book.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|A quick read with a sweet ending. Killer Cupcakes is fast paced and well written. Add in some awesome grandma detectives and you'll definitely develop a sweet tooth for Dobbs` work.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|There were a lot of naysaying critics grousing that this is typical Lucas over-the-top and there was too much CGI.  OK, OK.  Maybe so.  But so what?  This is something that has been needing to be publicized for many years, and, if this kind of movie was needed to do it, fine.  Maybe one day there could be a more &#34;serious&#34;, &#34;down-to-earth&#34;, &#34;thought-provoking&#34; movie made of the services of The Tuskeegee Airmen, but this was a good start.  CGI is here to stay, and, today, this is the only way they're going to be able to make those historic-airplane movies.  They're just not around in significant numbers.  The story is a good one and at least shows The Tuskeegee Airmen in combat after their training.  I recommend it.
B005COO1X6|3.0|If you are a King fan, you will find yourself in familiar, comfortable territory.  If you are a critic, you will say that he's just churning out another formulaic tale from the backwoods of Maine.<br /><br />Both may be right.  I enjoyed it but I am a fan.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Keeps your interest all the way to the end and for a change,<br />its not convoluted or far-fetched as many books of this genre are<br />nowadays.
B001BDZHUI|4.0|If you love this band must have as part of your colloection. Iam a cd addict but easier and better to download as mp3.
B002RB7VMA|5.0|This album is a great mix of tunes, rhythms, etc.<br />Fun and easy listening - I always want to crank it up
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Excellent fun free app... addicted.  Would love to get more special items, but understand the need for monetary support, especially for us freeloaders.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|This is the first of all the Batman movies that followed, and still is the best.  As over-the-top as Batman is, the rest of them went way to far over the top.  There couldn't be anyone else except Jack Nicholson who could have done The Joker justice!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Very simple: If you like Temple Run, you will like Temple Run 2. It is essentially the exact same game with a few more power ups, slightly different track scenery, and updated graphics. Looks great on the kindle fire though.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|It's a really an awesome game. You shoot and blow up planes. Become the best ace. It's a realistic game. At first it's a little hard to play. But it gets easier to play and more fun the more you play.
B005PK1G76|5.0|we have a bob stroller, it fit great. great materials and nice cup holders, love the zipper and the little pocket!
B000006342|5.0|I Love this CD and truly happy I ordered it. I am a Tina Turner fan and I have lots of her music. I read reviews from someone on Amazon b4 ordering it, so their opinion was very helpful. A lot of the songs from this CD I didn't have and the price was on the money!
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|This app does exactly what I had hoped.<br /><br />The allshare play compatibility lets me stream media to my Samsung Blu-ray Player/Home Theater at good quality. The best part is how easy it is. As long as both are connected to the internet, I just open up allshare play on the bluray player, select what I want to play on my phone, and tell my phone to output through the bluray player. It does more than just videos, too! I can wirelessly play my entire music library on my phone over the home theater system, too. perfect for parties.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B006RXQ800|5.0|Amazing movie!  Very well directed and the cast was perfect.  It's a bit on the longer side, but it kept you well entertained throughout.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|dont get me wrong it is the most fun and addicting game ever, but sometimes when i push the Same Me button, it freezes up, closes, takes my gems I used, and then doesn't give me back the gems I received while running.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's really fun but not until you revive and the game crashes. Please fix this because it's hard to enjoy it and beat the objectives.
0786962984|3.0|I'm a pretty big board game fan, so when I saw this reprint, I wanted to give it a try.  It was really inexpensive when I bought it, so even if it was a dud, I didn't feel I would worry about it. The board is well-made, although with the irregular tile size, it is sometimes hard to count your movement out. It really doesn't make a huge difference, but it would have been nice to have clear squares to move around on.<br /><br />The cardstock playing pieces are of average quality.  The treasure and monster cards a little small. Again, adequate to play, but nothing you are going to be wowed over.<br /><br />The game mechanics are rather shallow, but I was expecting this ahead of time. It's a very straightforward dungeon delve, hack n slash game. The dice mechanics are 2d6 with each of the four classes having a single hit number to defeat the monster. If you hit the target number the monster is dead and you get its loot. If you miss, it has a chance to attack back with a handful of random effects. The only wrinkle to combat is the wizard, who gets a couple spells and the ability to teleport to different areas of the board.<br /><br />Once you collect your target GP Value of treasure (classes have different goals), it's a race to the exit and first one there wins. It plays in about 30-45 minutes.<br /><br />I had fun playing it the first time, basically for nostalgia. Having been used to playing more current board games (mostly euros) it was certainly flat from a strategic level. But, it does do a good job of mimicking a dungeon crawl in DnD, minus the roleplay. I think kids would have fun with it for a few play-throughs.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Awesome, Just a good as Where's My Water ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B000FGGE68|5.0|Great Sci-fi adventure, arrived on time and played well.  Choreographed action sequences and beautiful visual effects with an interesting plot.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Omg this book is amazing I could not stop and I like the fact that it is so interesting from page one.  It took me about 45pages deep in fifty shades of grey.  Oh you gotta keep going.  I can't wait for the next one
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and its like caring for your own horse. I would recommend this game for horse lover's.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|It's ok but a lot of in app purchases, if you want to actually have fun with the app you need to buy some in app purchases
B006O7XOOW|5.0|So after reading some reviews about it not being steady I opted out of getting this. After Christmas it went on sale and I took a chance! It is very sturdy on our carpet. Not once has it fallen over with her trying to pull herself up. This thing keeps her entertained for hours. She is 10 months and dances to the music and even places the balls back up top! We have agreed that it is one of the best investments in toys we have made!
B000JBWWRY|5.0|It's a good value for the price. This is a classic movie for young and old. For the young, it's a new experience, and for the old it brings back memories.
B0002G2B2M|5.0|This product came early which I love. Also the condition was great no scratches or anything. The movie it self is amazing. I love this movie. It is slow in the beginning but picks up as you watch and grabs your attention to where you don't want to do anything else but watch. Very happy with the seller and the product. I recommend both
031620157X|4.0|I found the Land of Stories an entertaining read. It was like connecting all the dots to find out what happened to the Fairy Tale characters after their happily ever after and how their lives were entwined.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing, first the opening chapter had me, it was so real and full of emotion. I had to know what caused that kind pain! The plot was original and the characters were well developed and true to themselves! Nothing they did or said was out of place. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have to add that it was so nice for it to be a stand alone! But I can't wait to read more from Colleen Hoover!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|This movie is AMAZING, great acting, great story, just all around amazing movie, this is a MUST SEE. I recommend this movie to everybody.
0307730697|5.0|This book is truly inspirational.  I have purchased  several copies of this book, and have sent them to various people that I know.  They have similar responses consistent with mine regarding this powerful story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I always enjoy John's books. They are full of detail but not bogged down with it. The story is believable and engaging. Another Grisham page turner.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is much better than the first the monkey is a lot better to and its a little hardre an  u can be a girl or a boy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So fun and realistic. I love horses, so this app is great for me. Only problem is it sometimes takes a little while to open the app. Other than that, it's awesome!
B000007VCM|5.0|I think I own every CD The Cult ever made.  This is a great album, and I would recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game but could use a little work... such as colecting gems and more options the kind of horse other then that its pretty cool
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I like it! Great sounds, even some I would not expect.  You can even downlosd more sounds as they become available.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|It doesn't find the sky location I point to, apparently my Kindle Fire HD doesn't have the GPS I thought it did.<br />All I hear is music and I have to move the screen manually to find the sky I am looking at, not what I wanted.<br />It costs extra for info on what you are looking at, when it should have been part of the price you pay, even if that was more<br />Colorful but disapponting
B00902MCVY|5.0|I got Wintersun's first album shortly after it came out, and I have waited 8 long years for their next release. Well it is out! After listening to Time I many times I must say that it is excellent. Worth the wait. The only downside to this album is that it is meant to be listened to all at once, one track after another. If you skip around you won't get the full effect and may not like the album. This is EPIC SYMPHONIC METAL. The tracks are long and meant to be so. Enjoy it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game! there are so many options for caring and spending time with your &quot;horse&quot;. it would be good for littler children who want a horse or who are preparing to GET a horse!
B000007WNN|5.0|I think I own every CD The Cult ever made, but I think this is my favorite of them all!
B002M9WW30|5.0|When I saw the price this was I couldn't pass it up. I could not recommend this compilation more. Price, quality an speed of service couldn't have been better. 5*****!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|O M 2 THE G umm yah so i have never played this game b4 but all my friends doand they love it and say its fun so im gonna go play it now,.... BYE EVERYONE
B002GY9F9K|5.0|oh man was this a great tv series, I couldn't stop watching till I finished the entire season. Great action, great values of learning, and most definitly great actors.
B00650SSDU|4.0|it was a great gift for my nephew and scored lots of good uncle points with this now i just have to watch it
B004TI5N38|4.0|While parts of the story, specifically the military details and jargon, are cheesy to a veteran, the story was extremely well thought out. The details were immaculate and well developed!
B000SFZ05C|3.0|I think I own every CD The Cult ever made.  This is a good album, and I would recommend it.  However, this is their newest album, and I do prefer their older stuff more.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Mildly reminiscent of 12 Monkeys if only because Bruce Willis is a time traveler.  It's an interesting take on the time-travel paradox.  Well written.  Good acting.  Explosive action.  Not an Oscar nominee but definitely worth watching with the sound way up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|All I have to say is that  you should get it!! Its so fun!! I am so glad that I got it!!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Great tv series! I hope all see this cus it was amazing and great to watch. showed many moments that were fantastic and funny and even I learned things from it good morals and love that is very strong!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|what more do you need to say about a game you kill zombies fun entertaining great simple mind distraction for a good price
B008764ZQ4|5.0|If you liked the movie, you'll love the soundtrack!!! Listening to the soundtrack lets me relive the movie over and over. It may help to have a fondness for the 80's. :)
B0000085N4|5.0|I think I own every CD The Cult ever made.  This is the album that made them more known to radio stations around the country.  This is a great album, and I would recommend it.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This review is for the Kindle edition ebook.<br /><br />This is the follow up to \\"Ender's Game\\". It is the story of how Ender Wiggin learned to cooperate with alien life, rather than destroy it. In the first book, Ender learns to play a computer game that eventually wipes out an entire alien race. In this book, Ender must deal with the guilt and pain of causing that race to disappear. He also has learned not to make that mistake again.<br /><br />I really got into this story. I do believe we will encounter alien life before the world ends. How we deal with that encounter is always a question. This book is a fictional account of one way to deal with that alien life encounter. I felt the Introduction was too long for this book. I am not one who wants all the background behind the story at the front of the book. I would rather the author explain this at at the end. I want to read the story, then will read the explanations.<br /><br />I find the idea of someone speaking about the dead in a manner that correctly emphasizes their life and goals as very inspiring. I have been to more funerals than I care to count, and most of the time, the dead are spoken of as almost perfect. They were not that way in life, and yet, we, the survivors, find it very difficult to express their lives in real terms. I do not intend any disrespect to the dead, but it would certainly be refreshing to have a speaker that could put their life into perspective sometimes.<br /><br />I would like to say \\"Thank you, Orson Scott Card\\", for actually being able to express these thoughts I have had for so many years. Your book should be an inspiration to the living world wide. We should never jump to conclusions about the unknown, nor should we revere the dead above their actual life.<br /><br />I find this book much more reality based than the first book, \\"Ender's Game\\". For me, it is much better, and I will definitely be reading more of this author's books. While Game is fast-paced and exciting, this book is more involved. It is not a computer simulator game story, instead, it is the story of someone's life and their struggles. While it is fiction, it is an excellent view into the future of mankind. I highly recommend this book to those readers of science fiction who allow themselves to believe in the possibility of alien life.ok is more involved.

B00A8ECU24|1.0|It was a cute game at first, but then after some time, I found that it needs real money... Like $100. For virtual gems? Really? Also, I had gotten pretty far in the game, like level 30 or so, and I had stopped playing for a few days. Well, when I had decided to start playing again, EVERYTHING had started over and was gone. I expected better out of this because I really like My Little Pony, but this is rediculous.<br />Another thing, I can't connect with friends on Facebook. The game was supposed to be able to play with friends on Facebook or find random friends, witch I can do neither. I really hope they fix the bugs and lower those insane prices. Or maybe add new mini games (there's only four. That gives you about 10-20 minutes of gameplay at a time), add other (cheaper) characters, and just give the game a better plot besides spending all of your money.<br />I suppose I would call this a scam.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Dig the twists this movie takes. I'm usually pretty good at predicting endings. This one had the only ending it could truly have even if it wasn't  the one I was hoping for.
B003M6FGTE|4.0|my wife missed a lot of the season so this surprise gift was perfect she was overwhelmed the quality was excellent
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Loved the movie, love the soundtrack. I enjoyed the movie so much. The soundtrack is a great pick-me-up during the workday and I love working out to it at the gym!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this stinking app so much!  Its realistic and educational as well!<br />Its my faboriye game of all time!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I loved this book.  It makes you realize we are all connected!!!  I would recommend this book to everyone!!!  A must read!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a story!  Full of twists and turns.  I couldn't put the book down. I'll be reading this one again,.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is one gorgeous game.  Very fun to play, getsharder as you go. I find it<br />relaxing and very fun to play. Well worth the money.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I think everyone at one point or another is looking for a place to fit in.  Some of us also try to figure out why we act the way we do.  It is normal behavior or is something preventing us from living an authentic life?  Even though Charlie was only a teenager, it takes some of us a lot longer....  I came away from this book with don't be afraid of who we are and what we went through to get there, good and bad.
B005LAII9O|1.0|I live in Australia and I bought this version of the movie because it was advertised as an All Regions DVD. It's not. It won't work in any of our players or computers.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|great graphics and fun to play but small glitches. sometimes freezes..... wont load main screen. worth downloading much better than the first:)
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|What a treat this production was!!!  I have watched The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall 15 times and I never tire of it.  If you are a Phantom lover then you must buy this!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an excellent sequel to temple run. The graphics are average but i love all the new things like zip lines. You really should buy this app.
0544045203|5.0|A well crafted work. Intriguing deep and extremely well written . The ending is simply profound.  I would recommend this book to anyone in need of a good read.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was really good.  It was easy to get sucked into the story and the characters.  I liked Travis and I liked Abby. There were some parts that came off a little juvenile, but you have to keep in mind that these are college kids.  I liked Travis' take me as I am attitude, but I was glad to see his character develop and grow during the story.  Abby was a creation of her upbringing, but even she did some growing up by the end. I really liked all the secondary characters and they played their own part to the story.  This was a good story.  I can't wait for Travis' point of view.  **Side note: The editing for the kindle book wasn't good.  It wasn't distracting enough to take away from the story, but distracting enough to mention it.**
B002BI6SMI|5.0|full of action, great acting, bought it two times, one copy for me and the other for my daughter, she loved it also.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|was great until it wont open and I try to install it back on my device and it wont allow me to really pissed off at
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|It's very easy to use, found my wi-fi and tv. All I had to do was choose what to watch!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|We started using this app to simulate the sound of the ocean.  We used to live next to water and miss it terribly.  This app allows me to mix several sounds at once, controlling the volume of each contribution and the overall volume of the compilation I choose.  There are many sound choices in the free version.  The app also provides a timer that shuts the sounds off at any interval you choose.  Well worth the download.
0345529057|5.0|I purchased this gift for my boyfriend, a NON-READER.<br />He mentioned that if he did start reading books then he'd DEFINITELY start with this set. BAM! Perfect gift.<br />Now I can't pry him away from the books! Wait, why am I complaining? :)
B005I6EU7U|3.0|Although the style is nice I thought that the cover would lay flat when in the closed position - it does not it sits open about 1&#34;. It seems like it isn't really for the Kindle Fire but maybe for one of the other Kindles. Although I will keep the case because I have wanted a cover that looks like a book but If I find something better I will buy it to replace this one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is alot of fun and easy to follow along with but i think the unicorns are kinda lame and the animations are good. i suggest this game.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I think the ending could have been better. It almost seems like she gave up at the end. An extra chapter or two would have really been better. Maybe I am just disappointed that it's over...overall a wonderful series and I am very excited to see how they put it on the big screen.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great if you love horses! I totally recommend it! The graphics are really good too. It's kind of like having your own horse except a lot less expensive.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Extremly addictive.  Great graphics.  Game plays smooth.  However the game will lock up and shut down if you try to use a third and sometimes second save me.
034580404X|5.0|I am relieved that I finally have my own copy of the Fifty Shades trilogy to myself. It's in good hands.
1559409010|2.0|Funny in parts and pretty sad in other parts, just boring.  I remember seeing it 30 years ago and thought it was funny, now not so much.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I wish it had more features but overall very good. The effects are good in the photos and I really like how the pictures look after editing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|worth every penny.all the spen of apps are so crappy so get the really apps ignore the 200 people who don't like it its problly because its not as real as the computer or the xbox but you can take it eny where you go and don't even need wiring. its a minecraft lover's most get.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love Christian GREY & Anastasia Steele!!!! This was my second time reading the trilogy & it just didn't get old for me! Looming forward to reading again!
B001GCUNYO|3.0|This is a typical Hollywood action formula, but it is really pushing it:<br />An aged good guy armed with hand guns vs a truck load of bad guys in their prime with machine guns. As always, bad guys' machine guns can't hit a thing, even at close range. And of course, the good guy never missed.<br /><br />I watched it based on the rave reviews here, but I just couldn't get into it. A barely armed guy in his 60s wipes out a truck load of young guys with machine guns. That's just too much, even for Hollywood. Unless, Liam was secretly using the Force.
0142001104|5.0|The  Zanders book is a continuing well of stories that remind me about ways to allow myself and others to be the best we all can be.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Very captivating and entertaining! I think you would enjoy watching this! ..... ..... ...... ...... ....... ...... ..... ... ..
B006LSZECO|4.0|It kept me engaged which is hard to do! I have to admit that the ending suprprised me. I highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a really fun game to pass the time with. It is just as fun as the original. I would recommend this game if asked.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie - The Hulk stole the show!  I've always been a fan of Joss Whedon!  I hope he makes an Avengers 2.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Keeps you wondering for sure what will happen, and then, what will happen after the movie is over.  Great thriller.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I purchased this game for my cell phone originally because it couldn't support any of the other Bejeweled games. To my surprise this game is great!! I ended up purchasing it for my Kindle Fire & I enjoy playing this game on the larger screen. The vibrant colors & the game modes are quite addictive!! I would recommend this game to anyone who has played Bejeweled!!!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I find this app very useful because it is so specific with its details. It tells you how much Internet browsing time is left on it, or how much time 's left to use the Video application. If you like knowing about different aspects of your battery, this app is for you!
B00475AYJQ|3.0|Loved the first book but in this one he seemed to get bored half way through. Bored and horny. Stick with the story you started with.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I saw the movie and figured I should read the books. The book is way better than the movie. I am hooked and will be reading the other ones shortly.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks continues to inspire and understand his readers.  There's always a twist that makes it even more interesting and this book definitely has that.  I would recommend this to my friends.
B008OW1S3O|4.0|Heard one of the songs on the local college radio station (WUTK) and liked the sound, album was less than ten bucks so I gave it a try.  Very impressed!  Unique vocal styling, good beats, piano, good vibe overall.  I like it a lot, especially the first 4-5 tracks.  Mercury Prize winner.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has every thing I wanted. And is perfect for your daughter or son. I recommend a friend or person to get it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great app. Can't wait for temple run 3!! If you don't have this yet you should download it today. I highly recommend it!!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I love the way this author sneaks in references/fairytale medefores into the story. Ref (obvious) Cinderella, snow white and repunzle just a few I caught probably more that I missed. The story as old as time was crafted in a new and fresh way oh yes I also caught some star wars imagery.<br />It was a fun fast read can't wait to start the next one.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|The Game of Thrones is a very good series. It is, however, pretty dark and, at least to me, has a negative lens on what the ultimate nature of Man is. I think that I can see this summed up by that every supposition, of god, devil, etc. otherwise is shown to be fruitless. The chivalry of knights, the honoring of one's word, that good deeds will birth good, everything is false. That this may be true, to some degree, GOT goes, in my opinion, to the bleeding extreme with its nihilistic lens.<br /><br />Despite this, or because of this, it is a fun jaunt for one that is in the mood for this darkness. I don't prescribe to such a brutal, Hobbesian view, but I can enjoy the characters as they trudge through this dreary world. Respect the one's that still, despite the world that shows that it is fruitless, honor their 'words', broil at those that don't, and have a sad, tragic, emoting for those that have to live there.<br /><br />So, a dark, fun, ride-I also would suggest getting it in this format. It is really nice to have all the books on the Kindle to move back and forth easily.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|its an ok game but lags way too much and after i play it wont let me play anymore and i have to delete it and reinstall again.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My oldest son was at a loss at what to get his sister in law for Christmas. She loves board games so this was a perfect pick for her.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Super fun! Love playing this  game. Good time waster. Works great on my kindle fire hd. Defiantly would  recommend downloading. Best part is it totally free.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very sweet love story.<br />Both characters are humanly flawed and yet are perfect for each other.  I enjoyed their conversations and their banter.  I enjoyed watching them fall in love.
0762434279|3.0|It was in good condition and all, but we accidentally ordered the miniature edition. Guess we need to double check the title next time...and the cheap price!
B0002F6BRE|2.0|Found the movie to be stupid humor, not very funny, an embarassment despite being recommended by several people I knew.<br />Wonder what I missed?
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Paul tells a story of how when he was a child at his aunts or uncles homes, the entire family would gather for a party and they would all sing songs that meant something to the adults from the 40's and early 50's. He went on to explain how for him the memories of these songs and the social events are some of the warmest and most heartfelt of all his memories.  His mastery of choosing the music, his choice of musicians and the joy of hearing his voice is absolutely wonderful!  I can't say that I was ever a Paul McCartney fan, but this collection has won me over from now on.  I found myself enjoying similar memories as I listened.  Thank you for such a wonderful presentation of music and memory.
B007SPPANM|5.0|I am a big titanic enthusiast and I absolutely love this movie. Leo and Kate did an awesome job. Definitely worth the money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app, I love doing competitions and caring for my horse I definitely give this a 5 star, I definitely recommend this app!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Thanks! Great Product and perfect timing i hace to keep on writing la la la la la la la la!
B004UC4HCG|5.0|Easy to setup.  Purchased a 180 GB SSD drive.  It boots like lightening and is super quiet. i5 processor 8 gb ram windows 7<br /><br />very much enjoying this computer.
B0000549B0|5.0|&#34;You have to be either oh so smart or oh so pleasant.<br />For years I was smart. I recommend pleasant.&#34; Elwood P. Dowd (perfect)
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest.... the site has tons of ideas and information on just about anything you are looking for. I spend hours on Pinterest and have tried many of their DIY ideas and love them.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I sent this item as a gift and the recipient was very pleased! She said everything in the package is amazing, she's enjoying the CDs and DVD very much.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a good time waster but I can't really get in to it. It's still pretty fun, and a good time waster.
B001GMH8SI|5.0|Thanks! Great Product and perfect timing i hace to keep on writing la la la la la la la la!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This CD is really good, all songs that I like.  Usually when you buy a CD it has only 2 -3 songs that you like, but every song is good on this CD.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Cheesy and corny.. but I loved it! The characters were very endearing, the music/soundtrack I loved, especially the mash ups. Loved fat Amy's random humour!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So much better than the first! If you don't have room, make room. I'm telling you, download it now. Great quality, great everything.
B001NSAJ3G|5.0|A real blast from the past from a group that continues to be amazing. A must have for any Moody Blues aficionado.
B005IQZB14|5.0|After reading [[ASIN:B00AXPRA8M Ten Thousand Miles by Freight Train: A Memoir of Beauty and Freedom on the Rails]], I was looking for more adventure travel stories with strong female characters, and I was gifted this memoir by a friend. Since the book is so wildly (cough) popular, I expected to be disappointed. But, then, I wasn't- the way the different story lines are woven together in this memoir is both hypnotic and beautiful, and it is nearly impossible to put the book down until you are finished.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I get shocked when a thing suddenly pops up i think it is awesome the only thing is that you have to buy it but worth it
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I think of myself as a constant reader, so I have read several books, just for a hobby so my opnion is based on recreational reading.<br /><br />This is a great book, one of those that catch your attention and you just have to keep reading. Of course I saw the movie and love it as well however the book is far beyond better.<br /><br />Puzzo managed to pull together a great story, with detailed description without been boring, you also get enough profile detail about the main characters.
B004HUE57S|3.0|This is a good looking one but it's not great to use.  I tried to get used to it but it is hard for me.
B004DNWPY4|3.0|I bought this book thinking it would ravel something interesting. But it seemed pretty normal and only outlined<br />the common norm. Nothing out of the ordinary. Basically this book is no magic bullet.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Not the Batman I read when I was young, but entertaining. Anne Hathaway was a perfect choice as Catwoman. She is hot in tights as well as in a dress. The action was excellent.The pace was steady. The writing was good. The movie leaves open for Robin in future movies.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|This book was gifted to me after I read [[ASIN:B00AXPRA8M Ten Thousand Miles by Freight Train: A Memoir of Beauty and Freedom on the Rails]] and was yearning for more adventure, more freedom. I enjoyed how this book lets the reader take what they'd like from the story- Chris' story is both inspiring and a cautionary tale, both beautiful and tragic. Like life itself!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked this book very much. It was not what I expected after seeing the movie. Not like the movie, since it is written first person from the character's viewpoint. I especially loved the honesty of this piece.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|A refreshing, intriguing series...........superior quality to any other series or sitcom on television.  I'm so tired of empty scripts and bland humor.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good graphics, never laggy. Game play is sometimes a little slow, but still fun. I still recommend to horse lovers.
B001FB55MG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Adam Sandler just makes the movie. I sure will recommend this movie to others to see.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I very much enjoy not only the characters but the historical context with the changes that took place from the sinking of the Titanic forward. The characters and plots are written in the spirit of Dickens.
B0026772N8|5.0|After reading [[ASIN:B00AXPRA8M Ten Thousand Miles by Freight Train: A Memoir of Beauty and Freedom on the Rails]], I was looking for more writing by poet-philosophers on wild adventures; this book fit the bill quite nicely. Vicarious adventure and deep thoughts, nature and zen; a wonderful combination of which I will never tire.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Battleship is an entertaining movie. They blow stuff up, they beat the enemy, the guy gets the girl and the world is saved. Typical, perhaps, but if you're like me and you have a fascination with all things nautical, you will enjoy being inside the Navy vessels as well as the added treat of seeing real veterans in action. The filmmaker featured some of the real men who served on the USS Missouri in WWII as well as a wounded solider playing a supporting part. Great flick. I'll buy it!
B009POCG2C|5.0|My hubby loved this at the theater, so I had to get this to complete his Clint Eastwood collection. Clint's still got it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My brother got this game on his iPod and I really wanted it.A week later it came out for kindle and I was so happy.BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I found this game to be fun.  I couldn't put it down until I finished it.<br />I have played other games similar to this by other companies, and I liked the variety and plot that this one has.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|LOVE the game I think it would be cool if they made a second one of it I love the new york city.version of it!!!!!!!!!!!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I'd just finished reading [[ASIN:B00AXPRA8M Ten Thousand Miles by Freight Train: A Memoir of Beauty and Freedom on the Rails]], and was looking for more books of wild adventure with strong female protagonists. Eat Pray Love was gifted to my by a friend, and while I was initially wary, due to its popularity, I was ultimately won over. And after reading a book about a harrowing journey by freight train across the continent, it was pleasurable and relaxing to be taken to Italy, Indonesia, and an ashram in India. Perfect!
B00008YZYM|3.0|I bought this for my grand kids and probably won't watch it, altho I'm sure it's a good movie. I know they love the movie. The one I remember is with Haley Mills that my kids watched.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this one. Several other games that I have purchased have had areas that don't respond properly and waste my money. This game was great and the help button and clue diary were invaluable.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this  book,this is the second time I read it and just like the fist time I couldn't put it down. Such a great story, I am immediately reading the next book. Can't even describe how much I love this book!!!!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Great vocals and instrumentation, with a greater variety of sound to the album.  I'm really enjoying listening to it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first album.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is amazing but you kind of go slow when you run I'm not saying that it's bad because it was a great deal I Loooooooovvvvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeeee it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The best series on any television network.<br />The period detail and storyline is wonderful.<br />The actors are brilliant.<br />Great entertainment.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Great compilation of their music. So glad I bought it. Lots of memories and a reminder of just how good they are.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11  Great to see the truth about this! Had a party and shared this with some of my unbelieving friends. Made for a lively discussion.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love the series.  Highly recommend.  If you are on the fence, check it out.  You won't be sorry.  That's all I have to say.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Fun to play, AI could use a bit of work and it freezes up sometimes and needs to be rebooted, but a good tablet version for people who like the game but have no one to play with.  Pretty fun game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game. deffinatly a huge improvement to an already great game. great graphics and great new twists and turns to the game
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Scanner was easy to use. However, the knob to insert did not work so had to insert by hand which meant possibly fingerprints on negatives. negatives were sometimes difficult to insert. Seller should include additional negative holders because of all the scratches that happen. Pictures scanned really well except for scratches that showed up. Otherwise am satisfied with machine.
B00APACSJG|4.0|Vorkosigan stories are always fun and a good read.  I read them up until gone. Bujold is an inventive writer.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|so i'm not going to review the movie, this is just for the bluray. here are the bonus features for this bluray :<br /><br />Included Bonus Features:<br />Commentary with Writer/Director Gareth Evans<br />6 behind-the-scenes video blogs with Gareth Evans<br />Behind the Music: Featurette with Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park and composer Joe Trapanese<br />Inside the Score: A trailer teaser for Mike Shinoda's first feature score<br />An Evening with Gareth Evans, Mike Shinoda and Joe Trapanese feaurette<br />Conversation with Gareth Evans and Mike Shinoda: Details on the hard shoot, score, stunts, and themes<br />An Anatomy of a Scene: Outlines hole drop sequence<br />THE RAID TV Show Ad (circa 1994): Spoof of an actual 1994 Japanese anime TV commercial<br />Claycat's The Raid: Lee Hardcastle's UK claymation short film with a Mike Shinoda music score<br /><br />audio comes in 5.1 english, 5.1 spanish(latin) 5.1 spanish(castilian), 5.1 Portuguese and 5.1 indonesian.<br />subtitles: english, english SDH, Portuguese, spanish (castilian) spanish(latin).<br /><br />with this being bluray, i expected HD, but there are some scenes in the movie that show up grainy oddly, other than that, the special features really do a great job at giving you a cool behind the scenes look at how certain things were done for this movie. the english dubbing can be a lil over done, but for the most part there were good voice actors.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Page turner. Kept me guessing and curious. Not sure how I feel about ending but would definitely recommend to others.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I watched it and still very good movie to watch over and over.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|A movie with ghosts, ghouls, bullies and intolerance.  ParaNorman is an eerily presented but heartfelt story with many of the elements experienced by kids growing up today. The story takes you through this special boys trials and tribulations to show his unique strengths. The brilliant graphics in ParaNorman have become the staple in LAIKA productions. Like Coraline, this story line may not be suitable for younger children or children with prone to nightmares.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Was not sure what direction the 4th season will be going in since I wasn't sure where they were trying to go this season. But I will keep on watching!
B009H442DG|5.0|Olivia is still a beautiful women and singer.  She was the legend of pop music in the 70's & 80's.  She had numerous hits and movies.  With this CD her voice still shines as ever.  It is an uplifting holiday treat.  Enjoy!
0547848412|5.0|Yann Martel's Life of Pi takes themes that can be seen in numerous novels across history, like a person's will to survive and the nature or religious beliefs, and puts them into a completely unique setting. With captivating imagery that never fades, this book is by far a necessary for readers of all ages. Martel incorporates real-life struggle into a world of fantasy and hallucination-worthy scenes in a way that all comes together into a heartening story about struggle, loss, and the tremendous effort that it takes to survive in creatures that refuse to give up.<br /> At a young age, Pi Patel forces us to examine our own religious views and the merit behind them in the candid yet unobtrusive way that only a child can provide. As Piscine struggles with the decision of which religion he wishes to follow, he realizes that there should not be a limitation to one's beliefs, despite the protestations of his family and the religious leaders within his community.<br /> After a series of unfortunate events leads to Pi's being stranded on a life boat with only a 450 pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker for company, Martel examines how the will to live is within all creatures, teenage boys and tigers alike, drives us to continue on in the face of extreme adversity. With insurmountable obstacles to face, Pi and Richard Parker form an unlikely bond. Not the unrealistic kind seen in many an animal movie, but the kind of kinship that can only be found when one of the party would be more than happy to eat the other.<br /> Overall, Martel's writing enthralls you in such a way that you cannot put the book down and although the circumstances within the novel are extreme, they are of a nature that anyone could connect with. A truly wonderful piece of writing, I would highly recommend this novel for anyone.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Whenever I just want to veg, this is one of the apps I go to.  Love using the &#34;winning hand&#34; deal because I won't stop until I get it right.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Even my three year old can play it. This is a very fun and highly addictive game that is great for all ages.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Seth MacFarlane always has a way of making me laugh even if I feel bad about it later.  As an adult with an irreverent sense of humor I find genius in Seth MacFarlane's talents. This story of a young boy turned &#34;adult&#34; and his come to life Teddy Bear who both resemble the perpetual college roommates with nary a stated major. The multi-talented Mark Wahlberg fits the part very well and is truly believable as this guy with a gorgeous and exceptionally tolerant girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who always falls to the peer pressures of his life-long support system who is TED.<br /> This movie is certainly not for kids as the language, adult situations, and pure absurdity could leave scars in tender young minds!  Have you not seen &#34;Family Guy&#34;?
B007XNAQL0|5.0|Love Peter Gabriel and Secret World is one of his best works.  What better way to watch it then on Blu-Ray.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book is easily as good as the first book.  Now, he needs to get that third out there so I can see what happens!
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|great flick. if your kid is easily scared by cartoon ghosts, well then, he or she has bigger problems than what this film will do to them. i've seen a lot of one star reviews on here because this film \\"horrified\\" their child. ugh. the hand stop animation is beautiful and should be respected.  the story is fun and the voice acting is solid. this and Frankenweenie were the best two animated films i saw this year. without a doubt. check them out!
B007I2BZIE|2.0|wow....really....I bought it because I have every Rush release ever, a life long fan....so I had to get it.  I am more of a 2112 type fan but I still dig Power Windows too.  There was nothing here that caught my ear as being something special.  Sorry guys.  You let me down.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun... I recommend this game to everyone. Love it great time passer and then its hard to put it down.
B002SZAU1Y|3.0|Not one of her best but still a good read especially if you have to stop and start reading a lot
0205313426|5.0|This is a classic.  I've read it.  Read it again.  And again.  It's currently in the WC where I read bits of it every day.  Everyone who writes ought to read this.
B006FE83U4|5.0|You can't go wrong with this movie!  This is my favorite book.  So insightful on many levels.  Every one needs to watch this movie.
B004ZNACA6|4.0|As almost every other review here seems to come from a previous Pink Floyd fan, I decided to weigh in as someone who hadn't listened to much Floyd beyond The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, and Pulse prior to purchasing this box set.  I had always heard great things about Pink Floyd, and being a dedicated fan of all things prog-related, I felt I was sinning by not getting in to them.  Absolutely nothing I had read or heard about them told me that I wouldn't like them.  So, rather than just buying an album at a time for the next several months, I figured I would just get them all at once and be done with it.  All in all, I'm glad I did, though there are a few problems I have with this set that relate more to the set itself than the actual music.<br /><br />Before getting to the music, I'll whine about the packaging.  The box itself is fine and sturdy (though mine came in torn, but that's fixable if you have a glue gun).  I know a lot of people are upset about the minimalist artwork of the outer box, but I'm actually fine with that.  I'd take that over mishmashing elements of each album's artwork with the others (Plus it looks good next to my Led Zeppelin and Yes boxsets).  The booklet is a fine introduction for me.  It has plenty of nice photographs and such (Honestly, though, I rarely buy boxsets for the booklets.  I just like having everything together in one place.).  The biggest problem lies in the individual album packaging.  I'm theorizing that I recieved a defective copy (that's what I get for getting it from eBay rather than Amazon), but still.  The cds are wrapped in thin plastic sheets housed inside flimsy cardboard digipack cases.  I understand not giving them a sturdier case since they're designed to only be in the box set, but it wound up being very problematic for me because the glue material used to keep the digipacks together was terrible.  The glue would come undone on certain digipacks (the double albums in particular would have the sleeves falling apart), and on others it bled through and stuck the cd or the booklets onto the pack.  The cds were saved by their plastic sleeves, but the booklets for The Division Bell and The Final Cut were ruined when I tried pulling them out.  Essentially, I'm fine with the design of the boxset, but the production of it was awful.<br /><br />I'm noticing quite a bit of controversy about the quality of this new remaster.  Personally, it sounds fine to me.  Everything sounds crisp and clear, which I feel is necessary for textured music like this.  Admittedly, I don't have any old remaster to compare it to, so I can't compare it to the previous boxset masters.  To a first-time listener, though, this is entirely acceptable.<br /><br />As far as the music itself, overall I'd say that PF deserves most of their accolades.  Not every album is great, and I'm not quite as wild about Piper at the Gates and Dark Side as others are, but throughout the discography, Floyd has a concise vision and sound that remains distinctively Floyd-ian.  Their sound might change in varying ways from album to album, but it still sounds like them, and for that consistency through change, I appreciate them.  I can't call everything here truly essential up until around Meddle, but there are far more ups than downs and I highly reccomend it to people thinking of, well, discovering Pink Floyd.<br /><br />My personal favorites are A Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall (which to me just does not sound like anything else released at the time.  Relentlessly bleak.).  Great stuff.  More and Obscured by Clouds feel underrated to me.  All in all, though, you can't go wrong with this set if you're wanting to start exploring some Floyd.
1250010403|1.0|As stated, this book is part of The Clifton Chronicles. If you write 3 books, you sell 3 times as much as if you write 1 book. While the book is not a bad read, the ending is a false ending and is poor. It is the end of act one (actually act two in this case as this is the second book in the series). You do not need to read book one to understand this but the non-ending is frustrating.<br /><br />Let's face it, Jeffrey Archer is a good story teller. But this is a pathetic attempt to squeeze money from readers.<br /><br />Same now for Ken Follett and the series that begins with Fall of Giants and ends nowhere.<br /><br />Sorry, there are better stand-alone books to read.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I liked this movie because it is a nice modern twist and very adult like. Which is becoming more popular and is very exciting to me.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I had the Eureka cordless vac, but every time I went to use it the battery was dead, also I could not keep it in the kitchen where I needed it.  This little sweeper does what I need and stays charged for a long time.  Keep in mind that it does not have suction, it is just a rotary brush sweeper, but it does a great job.  And I love how easy it swivels.
1439156816|5.0|Picked this up when I began my sojourn in the craft of writing (how pretentious does that sound?) last year.  I figured King might know a thing or two about being a successful writer.  The first half the book is a bit of his life story and is entertaining while the last half is about actually critiquing.  Great read. Probably my favorite book for writers after The Elements of Style.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it it is so much fun.  I recommend this game.  The little ones will love it especially little girls.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I am 7 and I thought this was a really good book. There are a lot of funny parts.<br />-Carter P.S. :-)
B000B589JI|3.0|I bought this because it was a Zippo product supposedly made in the USA.  It is not made in the US, but China. It functions as advertised, however.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Pretty much the best movie i own in 3D. Just the chance to see ScarJo that close makes it all worth it.
0525478817|5.0|I loved it, and it arrived quickly! I might be buying from here again some time in the near future!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|all the best songs from the movie are on here. not a bad price, either. worth the money i paid for it
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Helped me so much  much with home work I loved using it best dictionary ever even for a elementary student
B009YQJ322|5.0|Do You like movies like \\"Event Horizon\\", \\"Riddick\\", \\"Pandorum\\", \\"Sucker Punch\\" or \\"Doomsday\\"?<br />Then You like uncompromising features, that don't want to please the mediocrity of viewers, but want to stay true to some idea that carries the whole movie - and risk being a big financial failure.<br />And then You will surely love \\"Dredd\\" as an ultra - violent piece of movie, suspenseful and stylish.<br />I'm not surprised that it did poorly at the local cinemas, because this is rather some kind of fan movie, nothing for people that don't know \\"Judge Dredd\\", don't like violence or don't like one-line-sentences or a predictable story.<br />But I do like all of this. Let's see the sequels!!!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|You've signed up to see a Judge Dredd movie, you know what you're in for.  This is not a cerebral head scratcher, this is straight up action and grim, frowny faced frontal assault on all that stands outside the LAW.  Great: script, acting, editing, sound, composition, cast etc etc.  Again, not an arthouse flick so don't get all JUDGE-mental.
B008CJ0KI8|3.0|Interesting album, I look forward to listening to further releases by this artist.  Lost is a very catchy song. really enjoyed the album.
B009G5TWFO|5.0|one of my favorite movies of all time. loaded on my kindle fire HD. took alot of memory because of the HD but worth it. the picture quality is amazing.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Very cute movie, husband was a little bored but all in all worth seeing, great cast, I thought it was entertaining.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|A really thought proving book with a few important ideas.  The style is very personal and sometimes this gets in the way of the ideas - if you invite variability why would you have such a restricted diet?  But as a person who has had risk in their title for much of their career this is a really important book and expresses many of the thoughts I have had for years but have not been able to distill anywhere near as well. This book will linger and become part of the furniture
B00914JWSW|4.0|Great fun.  These are recordings made years ago, chosen by &#34;La Streisand&#34; from &#34;the vault&#34;;  i.e., whomever at the record company(ies) who was keeping these wonderful master tapes.  &#34;How are Things in Glocca Morra&#34; from Finian's Rainbow alone was worth the price of admission!<br /><br />Streisand fans will simply love this new collection of previously unreleased recordings by this iconic artist at her peak.  Sound quality is top notch throughout.  You'll love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun. I couldn't wait until it came<br />out.I would recomend it. it is so fun.thank you.
B003O6R3Z2|5.0|The value of this cd set is incredible.  Almost 500 songs of shubert lieder all in one package.  Dieskau has an amazing voice that will ever be associated with german lieder.  The recording quality is great.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|saw my grandson playing it and ask if i could try it. was totally hooked and put it on my kindle fire the next day. it's fast, fun and addictive. hard to put down. great for any age.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great kids movie, the kids can watch over and over again and not get bored, highly recommend for children and adults!
B00866JL96|5.0|This movie was a great and romantic love story. It kept me guessing to the end as to what was going to happen next.
B007HACDLK|5.0|any Mitch Rapp book is great for me .  in my mind he is wonderful.  don't want him to age any more!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Read it in one day, and loved every bit of it! Such a heart wrenching story line with such wonderful characters. Highly recommended!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|its great. it never makes me oversleep. plus it repeats itself if you don't push dismiss. GET THE APP SOON
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|this new game is a lot of fun. different challenges, espeacially the atmosphere, there is none, so it's a whole new game and different stratagies. lots of fun.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Great kids movie, the kids can watch over and over again and not get bored, highly recommend for children and adults!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Picks up directly from the first book. I love this trilogy.  Recommend for any readers who like romance and good love scenes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really liked this book. I could hardly put it down. I was a very emotional story and I loved the characters and how their relationships developed.
B00AECDDYY|4.0|maybe I`m expecting too much from a handheld device game, but I would have rated higher if there were more upgrades available. it's a fun little game, but would be better with more ship upgrades.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I love this CD. its a solid play and I think I bought for 5 bucks. I love amazon 5 bucks cds.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I haven't finished watching the entire collection yet, but I can't wait to either. So far, amazing!! A must own.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Very cute movie, husband was a little bored but all in all worth seeing, great cast, I thought it was entertaining.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent conclusion to the trilogy.  Was sad to finish it but excited to read the set again and again. Enjoy.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|reallh simply touched my heart. a sweet story about being more insightful and wiser that you think . those yoo assum know the least are far more in tune than you  cam imagine
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is unbelievably addictive. It's free and you can level up without having to buy anything. The dragons are really interesting too.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Love this app. I haven't stopped using it since I got it. would def recommend it to friends and family.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Claro y directo sobre la desgracia que representa el trigo ( el gluten) para nuestras dietas. De lectura obligada para todos aquellos con problemas de salud y los saludables. Una joya.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great kids movie, the kids can watch over and over again and not get bored, highly recommend for children and adults!
0783240236|5.0|This is a movie I watched when I was younger and I still love to this day.  Good for individuals who like classic suspense movies.
B000WOT406|5.0|great album. perfect for relaxing and listening quietly, or for getting your jam on. i enjoy this album often! i love it!
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|pretty good story - a little more intense than I thought it would be - probably good for 12 and over only in my humble opinion
0316017922|5.0|Excellent copy and shipped fast. This is one of the books that I have been waiting to read. clean book.
B000URWYTS|2.0|I kept waiting for something to happen and was continually disappointed.  I know it has received acclaim as a historical novel, but however accurate it is, I didn't get a feel for the times at all.  I can't believe a woman as interesting as the protagonist seems from accounts of her life, could actually be as boring as she appears here.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Great movie, both me and the husband enjoyed it,suspenseful and didn't see what was coming, highly recommend , good for a date night.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I decided to see what all the hype was about.  Instantly loved the book.  Romance books are my thing and this one is a keeper for me.  I like how this isn't your normal gooey romance and the love scenes are hot!  If you're into romance novels and like a little kinkiness, read this trilogy.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Kids love this game, and I bring it in when I volunteer during Math.  Great game of strategy. Everyone is engaged.
B008UWEFU6|4.0|I got this for my sister as a xmas gift. I do wish they had hardcover, couldn't find it here. Over all she's happy with it. I have not read it so I can't say whether I love the book or not, I just purchased it.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Being a Firefly junkie I was excited about this show and I was not disappointed!!! The blend of drama and comedy is perfect. I am sitting on the edge of my seat and laughing at the same time!
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|I still think about this book, but wish I didn't.  It was hard to read, in that you knew that absolutely nothing good was going to happen, and you just had to wait to see how bad it would be.
B001706I5I|5.0|Great kids movie, the kids can watch over and over again and not get bored, highly recommend for children and adults!
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Tthe ending was very unsatisfactory and was given away early in the telling of the legend near the middle of the story.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Where are the therapists, the guardian ad-litem contacts for this child? Majority of judges would never allow this to go on, and if they did, there are others that would file, and file and intervene.  Children in care receive reviews every 6 months, teams look at services and interventions.  Courts now employ Court Appointed Special Advocates to also follow children in alternative care.  I found it unrealistic also to present this young woman as not having substantial life skills.  Group homes, foster homes have available programs and curriculum as well as after care supports to avoid what was presented in this book.  I believe the depiction of the feelings and struggles..very true.
0765325950|5.0|I've read all the previous books, once over the years, and all of them again in the last two years anticipating the last novel.  I have to say, it wrapped up all the various plot lines, prophecies, and characters very well.  I typically judge a book by how little I put it down, and I never set this one down.  Sanderson has done a fantastic job here, finishing up one of the longest running, most complex fantasy story lines ever written.  Are there parts that may have been excessive, or characters that weren't quite written the way Jordan did them?  Sure, but Sanderson isn't Robert Jordan.  He did an excellent job of stepping into his brain though, and ending things with a bang, and that's all anyone should expect.  Honestly the number of characters and plot lines left flying when Jordan passed on was crazy.  I don't know that he himself could have wrapped it up any better.  As for the 1 star reviews, there are whole lot of angry people over the ebook delay, a large number more that appear to have not recognized the huge number of characters and references to earlier books, and a bunch more that I don't think would have been happy even if Jordan had lived to write the conclusion.  If you've read the previous books, pick this up, you won't regret it.<br /><br />And Mr. Sanderson, excellent job, that couldn't have been easy.
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|This is a typical Tim Burton movie, and it's a good one.<br />I should have thought through the premise (the dog had to die to come back to life).<br />My 10 year old daughter commented in the first 30 minutes, under her subtle tears, &#34;this is one of the saddest movies ever...&#34; but recovered as the dog came back, was funny, and ultimately prevailed.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I rated this as a five because I took his advice on eating healthier and running to campus for class instead of driving and I feel better than ever.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Great kids movie, the kids can watch over and over again and not get bored, highly recommend for children and adults!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I was not a fan of Renee Zellweger until I saw this movie. It is the emotional and beautiful story of Beatrix Potter, which I did not know until I watched this. A great family film and one of my favorite movies!
B00867GHS8|5.0|Excellent the 3d is spectacular - I can't beleive it wasn't designed for 3d from the outset. Adds a whole new dimention to an already excellent film.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was so entertaining and full of good science that I actually recommended it to some of my students to read, and they have also reported enjoying it.  I hope to read more by Mr. Weir as I found the main character's sense of humor so great that I couldn't put the book down.  Awesome book!
B000005GWH|5.0|Richard Elliot on his own after a stellar time with Tower of Power. Great mix of music from one of the premier sax men in the business. Check out &#34;Boys from the Bay&#34;.
B004LROMQG|5.0|Love the videos it was so exciting, magical I loved every episode can't wait for the forth season shared them and they liked them too.
B001TODCII|5.0|Great movie, both me and the husband enjoyed it,suspenseful and didn't see what was coming, highly recommend , good for a date night.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|When I got my Kindle I had a tough time figuring out how to navigate the files loaded on it. This little piece of FREE software makes it a Snap!
1568363931|5.0|This cookbook literally revolutionized the way I eat lunch. I always grabbed whatever I could to take to lunch IF I decided to eat lunch at all. I would have never thought I would have the time to prepare a healthy, delicious meal in the morning before work. With these recipes, you don’t spend more than 20 minutes preparing your lunch in the morning. Many of the meals can be prepared in around 10 minutes (with some prep the night before). The directions are so easy to follow, the flavors are amazing, and the meals are healthy! I am also so happy I found a way to add so many veggies to my diet in a really delicious way. I used to eat whatever was easiest which usually meant it was full of preservatives and generally unhealthy. Now that I am using this cookbook, I can’t believe I was not taking the time to treat my body with care by feeding myself fresh and healthy foods. Buying this book was the best decision ever!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the only thing I did not like about this app is that it came out on the I pad before the kindle and the powerups don't last as long and take u really far
0307712508|5.0|Amazing story about the Lacks family.  Listened twice.  This shipped and arrived more quickly than I had expected.  Would use this store again!
B001LF347E|5.0|I had to have them all they was so good with so much magic and excitement can't wait to own the forth season.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Great kids movie, the kids can watch over and over again and not get bored, highly recommend for children and adults!
B003L77GRO|5.0|Hi, I highly recommend Dexter. And if you are not willing to pay for Showtime then this is the next best way.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|This was delivered expediently and it has brought great satisfaction. My sister is a huge fan of Taylor Swift and this is exactly the kind of gift to give anyone who hasn't had the opportunity to go to Taylor Swift's concerts. It's the perfect combination of her show and getting to know her. The CD and it's bonus tracks were also sublime.
B008602KQI|3.0|For someone who read the books and thought and liked them alot, the movie was sorta a let down. k
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was a great love story with a great twist! I really enjoyed the book and couldn't put it down!
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Great first album for Phillip!  I don't think there's a bad song on here.  Very soulful.  Looking forward to more from him.
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|Having a relative who worked with Special Forces, we found this very interesting.  It is well done, but, ironically, one of the things that makes it interesting causes its one weakness.  Actual Special Forces soldiers are used to play the parts of the SF people in the movie.  They do an amazingly good job of acting, considering that, and they certainly leave nothing to be desired in the many action scenes, but this is the first movie I have ever seen where the bad guys did a better job of acting than the good guys.  :)  That said, the equipment used is the real stuff, and the shooting is done realistically, and the acts of bravery and heroism are not only believable, but true to what we know from our contacts.  The plot is great, and moves right along, and the filming is fantastic.  This is worth seeing just because it is real, and shows both the good and the bad guys for what they are.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I was looking for a way to simplify the task of saving files and photos on my Kindle Fire HD. This hits the spot-on. And it was free!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Not sure why I even bought this, but am so glad I did.  Not so much Sci-Fi, but very close to Sci-Now.  Although it is  technical, the author shows an astounding knowledge of space exploration, the planet of Mars, life support system theory, and storytelling in general.  The protagonist is clever, and funny throughout the entire book despite being in constant danger.  I would recomend this novel to any of my science loving friends.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My kid loves this movie and it was a great price. It also came quickly even though it was during the holidays.
B00AYL7OAY|4.0|&#34;Fade&#34; sounds as though YLT might have recorded it in 1997, or 2003. It's like a shoe that feels like you've always worn it from the first time you put it on, or a new dish at an old favorite eatery. Instantly familiar, but too brief to be tired, it's an easy, melancholy pleasure.
B009DKFSRI|4.0|Love Pitbull, but still could pick up some of the language in the other version, it was like they just bumped the CD and skipped over it.  I gave the other version to a friend who isn't as offended by it as I am. Still enjoy his music and I'm sure will buy his next one.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|The facts and fiction joining in an amazing novel. Can't wait for Edge of Eternity. Unfortunately will have to wait until next year...
0060001941|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very nice story. I think my Wife bought it for our Grand Daughter because she and our Daughter both loved it.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|We have been listening to this CD in our car non-stop since it was received at Christmas.  We all have different favorite songs.  Good job Taylor!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great book. Very easy to read. Loved it. A must read for any red blooded American .
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I LOVE IT U CAN GET PRIZES AND PUZZLE PEACES SOME TIMES I CASH MY PRIZES IN FOR COINS IT IS AS FUN AS  TEMPLE RUN 2,
B0063IH60K|5.0|Albeit this app was free, it is one of my favorite ways to pass the time and is also, obviously, one of my favorite apps.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is pretty good the real life quality is good and I cant wait to see where this game goes in the future and I would tell people to play this game and tell friends to play this game
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a real fun version of Mahjong that I truly enjoy. Quick.easy.and lots of fun. Try a round and enjoy! See Amazon for your app.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another wonderful book by Nicholas Sparks. Suspensful to the very end. extremely well written recommend to all. Looking forward to see how the movie turns out.
B006LSZECO|4.0|So many twists and turns, I kept changing my mind on what happened and couldn't wait to find out.  I didn't love the ending.
B00004X10B|5.0|Oue son makes his living by photography and needs a sturdy and dependable bag.  Arrived in time for Christmas.  Great buy.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I have always been a Star Trek fan so when I saw the chance to purchase the collection I did.  The only complaint I have is that one of the cases was cracked when I got it.  The DVD's seem to be in fine condition.  I haven't watched them yet as I haven't had time, but am anxious to be entertained.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Very simple navagation and browsing tools! I like that a list of your activity on ebay is easy to see and manage and it doesn't move from your main search list.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I sure wish this app was viewable in landscape mode. Other than that its a nice app that lets you know the forecast anywhere &amp; i especially like the extended forecast feature!
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book is so-so.  I loved the HP series but this book is not the same level of &#34;good&#34;.  It is rather boring and too long,  The premise is somewhat intriguing but there are so many characters.  I can't keep them all straight which means that the author is not letting me get to know them before just using their names.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read the book prior to seeing the Fifty Shades Parody and was slightly  disappointed on what lies ahead.  It's definitely a quick read!
0061478784|5.0|Love this book so much. Read in a just a few days because it was such a great book to read.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I thought that since this movie was a colaboration effort that it would be more action packed, but it was still a good movie.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|graphics are great, super fun to play and its a sequel to temple run! But i have a kindle fire and it wont let me open it even though i have like 5 times top!!!!
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I ENJOY WOODY ALLEN'S MOVIES.  THIS ONE IS IMAGINATIVE AND EVERYONE IS VERY GOOD IN THEIR PARTS. I ENJOY GOING BACK IN TIME FILMS.  THANK YOU AMAZON.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|It's pure Streisand; she's the greatest! I don't understand why she would have left these songs off earlier albums but she's the singer, I'm the listener,
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|i love playing this game! its super easy and very challenging. there are so many different levels to play, if you get tired of one kind of game, go to another.
0452289963|5.0|I started off reading the best seller Power of now and then went on to this book. All i can say is that i love the teachings and its a recommended book from me! Eckhart Tolle is an amazing earth being and he has helped me awaken.
B006IYFCIM|4.0|Good quick read, this could really make a difference in they way organizations are structured.  I liked the way the studies were set up.
B00005QCYD|5.0|I love all the 'classic' movies & I'm really happy to add this to my collection of Jurassic Park & The Lost World.
B004ZG5F28|5.0|I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE MANY TIMES.  I REALLY LIKE THE PEOPLE CHOSEN FOR THEIR PARTS.  THE PREMISE IS INTERESTING AND WELL WRITTEN.  I CAN RECOMMEND THIS FILM.  THANK YOU AMAZON
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is just as addictive as the first temple run. It's not what I had expected and the new challenges are great for keeping my attention. Adding in the tunnel is also really cool because it changes the whole game entirely for a few seconds which is really cool.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am addicted. I have a slight addiction to this game. 24 hours level 10 already... yeah tomorrow I go back to work we will see if there are any side effects.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game was a lot of fun.  Im glad it gives you a preview when it is downloaded so that you know exactly what you are buying.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My Grandson and I were very pleased with this purchase. He especially was very surprised and excited when he opened the package. I'm so very glad I purchased something that actually FEELS like it will last. It is also very nice to the touch and has a very nice look to it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game rocks the graphics are great and I love how they have unicorns!it is great for if u lobe horses or if u just want some entertainment
B004IFYN2E|5.0|I ENJOYED LOOKING AT JOLIE.  I PERSONALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE. THE LOCATIONS ARE LOVELY TO LOOK AT AND ALL OF THE ACTORS WERE GOOD IN THEIR PARTS.  I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE WAS INTERESTING AND IT HELD MY ATTENTION.  I HAVE WATCHED IT SEVERAL TIMES.  THANK YOU AMAZON.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|... of awesome story telling. I love the word play the writer takes one on. She knows how to keep it exciting without taking a timid reader over the edge.
B006C1DH92|5.0|This was the first game on my new kindle.  My grandson loved this game and played it game constantly.  He still plays from time to time.
B005LAII8K|3.0|It seems as if film making has hit a wall.  It was &#34;Okay&#34;  The movie lacked any real surprise.  Wish I would have rented first.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great. Now I must read more! Way better than first but prob. Because I haven't seen the movie.  Suspenseful as can be.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Is a must app to keep up with family, friends and associates. Excellent to keep up with family events and easy to use.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE WAS VERY GOOD FOR AN ACTION MOVIE. IT IS A BLOODY, VINDICTIVE MOVIE. THE ACTORS ARE ALL GOOD IN THEIR ROLLS AND IT HOLD YOUR ATTENTION.  THANK YOU AMAZON
B007IXWL2C|5.0|... story line. Too bad it is the last book. Now expectations are high and men better start learning fast. :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Currently using the reading plan program.  Not only does it give you numerous reading plans but gives you numerous versions to pick from.
B0031R5K7M|5.0|As part of the Inheritance cycle I wouldn't recommend reading as a stand alone novel but as part of the series it was a great read.
B0090OW7J4|5.0|If you like Hiatt, you will like this album<br />if you havent heard him, check it out.<br />Great album, and fun listen
B008J9EYFG|5.0|First, the vinyl version comes with a physical CD.  Thanks for that.  Free downloads are appreciated, but the actual CD is a convenient bonus.  If you still listen to music on loudspeakers and not just headphones, take the cloth grills off, put on your MindFold(r) and relish the beauty of the song \\"Mystery\\" (track 10).  Kudos to the engineer (and of course Mrs. Orton) for delivering an absolutely exquisite vocal sound.  For those of you that don't have the luxury of owning a proper sound system, visit the nearest boutique hi-fi dealer and demo \\"Mystery\\" on an outrageously priced stereo.  The entire album is gratifying, but the vocals on track 10 will elevate your soul.
B0049M7BDE|5.0|I HAVE ENJOYED THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  IT IS ROMANTIC AND I THINK IT IS ONE OF RUSSO'S BEST ROLLS.<br />I FELT INVOLVED WITH THE ACTORS IN THIS FILM.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT.  THANK YOU AMAZON.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|.... to more shades :) It was a good thing I waited until after I completed my class or it would have put me behind on all course work. I couldn't put it down once I got started. I like how the writer kept the emotional value of the relationship above the physical desires and dark &#34;shades&#34; of the character. Great read.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO SEE THIS AT THE MOVIES. I SEEN THE PREVIEWS BUT DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE. BOUGHT IT RIGHT AWAY. ALWAYS BUY FROM AMAZON FIRST. ITS ADORABLE. ONE OF THE DISNEY TREASURES. WONDERFUL CHARACTORS AND AND STORY. WILL BE A DISNEY CLASSIC FOR SURE!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is the illest game in the rapin' house!! All 'dem rappas be playin' dat app!! Go Barry Bones!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run two is so awesome I'm so glad that it finally came out.<br />If you enjoyed the first temple run you will love this one!!!
B0007MVXQG|5.0|This Priest album rocks hard.  I think it's one the best albums that JP has made.  This is only my opinion though.
B0037B6QSY|4.0|I liked Wherever You Go for its clarity. The book tries to make mindfulness practical, but it still remains largely philosophical. I bought it along with few more books on mindfulness. The most in-depth guide to meditation and how to use it in every-day life was Secret Techniques for Controlling Sadness, Anger, Fear, Anxiety, and Other Emotions, which says nothing about the meditation or its background. But Wherever You Go helps to understand where Secret Techniques come from. I highly recommend both these books.

B004SN8Z2U|5.0|I bought these to replace my worn out new balances as my every day shoes.  Having warn vibram fivefingers and loving the way they felt but wanting something a little more normal looking for everyday wear, I decided to try these out and was happily surprised.  They fit great and feel amazing.  Would definitely recommend for everyday wear especially in the colder months.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This story kept me awake reading, I didn't want to put it down.  If you liked Apollo 13, you will really like this story! Slightly raunchy language, but not over the top, and it was appropriate.  I hope to see more from this author!

B005NFW0U0|5.0|I always find it hard to do reviews on series and such because really it all boils down to personal taste. This is however a great series that I highly recommend and I purchased from my smart tv so I can access it anytime. I really can't complain about the quality since it is viewable right away.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun game and realistic too. You . Can clean the horse feed it and do competitions too.
B0000714BP|5.0|The acting is superb.  This film proves that Patrick Swayze was such a fantastic actor.  The three of them together was magic.

1881273873|5.0|Over the last 12 years four different people have referred me to this self-help book including my therapist.  I've since been telling others.  It is one of the very best self-help books I've ever read.  It has helped me immensely.
B004DM0UII|5.0|The program is amazing. It allows you to listen to all types of radio stations, and best of all, of all languages. Regardless of whether you are Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, etc. The music of your culture is there.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept me wanting more, not sure what would happen next. Cant wait to read the next two books, thrilling stuff

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is an amazing book that makes you wish your man was fifty shades. Don't recommend this book to your gramma.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was such a good book.  I remember reading it when I was young and reading it again was a great choice.  The story is so good and keeps you interested throughout the book.  Wonderful and would recommend to anyone as a good read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so fun and it would be fun to horse riders. Good graphics, you can play 100% free, visit other people's horses, you can compete in shows (show jumping), overall great game.
0399246665|5.0|This came on time and was what I expected.  I love Eric Carle's books and so did my son when he was little.  now I give them to my grandchildren.

B008M0NDOK|4.0|The Duo Controller is a nice sized controller that is easily synced to an iPad.  You just turn on the controller, then with a few screen clicks on the iPad, the controller is ready to go.  It has two thumb sticks, a directional pad, four buttons and two triggers which seems like more than enough for most apps.  I found that it seemed a little light and wished it had some feedback, but my daughter liked it just fine.  The response was very good and had no lag, although I did lower the sensitivity in the game because it felt too fast.  I could not use the stand because the iPad already had a cover on it and it wouldn't fit into the slot.<br /><br />To test it there was only one game available for free and one for $0.99.  The other three games though were $6.99.  The game we played was \\"Brother in Arms 2: Global Front\\", which is a fun FPS game.  With auto-aiming set on, it was easy to go through the first few levels and kept mine an my kids interest.  There was a good mix of controller and touch screen.  The only problem was even though the controller was synced through blue tooth, it doesn't automatically use it in the game.  You still have to go to the settings in the game to change it to the controller and it was not very intuitive to set it right.  And you have to wait for the game to load before you know, so it took a couple of minutes to set.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Easy to hook up and sync to an iPad<br />- Controls are responsive with no lag (I did have to lower the sensitivity on the game because it felt too fast)<br />- Brothers in Arms 2: Global Front Free<br />- fun game, I'm not good at FPS games, but with the auto aiming it was easier and I could get through some levels, back story was average<br />- good mix of controller, plus you can still use touch screen (to throw grenades and heal life)<br />- My daughter was better than me (maybe this is really a con)<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 1 game was available for free (so only one game was reviewed)<br />- 1 game was available for $0.99, and 3 others were $6.99 (I would have also grabbed the 99 cent game, but the iPad was not connected to my account, only Anna's so I didn't get it)<br />- I felt the controller was a little too light, but Natalya thought it was just right (she has an Xbox, so has something to compare with)<br />- The stand does not fit an iPad that has a cover on it.  Luckily their cover already came with a stand.<br />- No feedback in controller.<br />- Brothers in Arms 2: Global Front Free<br />- It took a couple of tries to get the game to use the controller (options screen wasn't intuitive and it doesn't automatically switch even though it's connected through bluetooth)game was available for $0.99, and 3 others were $6.99 (I would have also grabbed the 99 cent game, but the iPad was not connected to my account, only Anna's so I didn't get it)<br />- I felt the controller was a little too light, but Natalya thought it was just right (she has an Xbox, so has something to compare with)<br />- The stand does not fit an iPad that has a cover on it.

B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|My 3 year old grandson has watched this DVD many many times. My daughter requested it to get him ready for the polar express train ride they took him on before Xmas. It has been well used and has stood up to the test. Shipping time was awsome also.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this game. It is very fun and entertaining. I like how easy it is to figure out. The only thing is the competition part is hard. But isn't that how it's supposed to be?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm glad I purchased the trilogy as I was able to read all three before going to the movie to see the first one.  However as is the case most of the time the movie wasn't anywhere near as good as the book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I choose this game basically because its the second version of the TEMPLE RUN, which I love too.<br />TR 2 is great, has more details and more challenging than the first TR. By the way, my grandson (3) absolutely loves it too.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is a great brain teaser and is good for exercising one's deductive reasoning abilities. The background music track helps put one in a reflective frame of mind.
1781163243|5.0|This book is awesome, love the pictures, got it as a gift for a friend but after I gave it to him I was thinking about getting one for me too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is way better than the last temple run!! But I would say it get a little boring after a while I think that y'all should add more climates like snow and rain and stuff like that, now that would make it the best game ever!!!!
B002KYGLVQ|4.0|It starts slightly slow, but it is a really good story. Interesting plot and the ending is pretty wild. Worthwhile.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Entertaining, refreshing. Although it can get predictable, its still moving and keeps you on your toes. No I didn't read the comics so the divergence from the comic books is fine by me.
B000OLGCI4|3.0|The cover and package did not tell me which one had the best copy of the film on it and I made the mistake of assuming the film as well as the behind the scenes review would be on the commemorative version, it was note so the recipient of my gift was disappointed but it was very nice to see the background just not what she requested for Xmas.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have spent a great deal of time with his game. I have been enjoying it and not getting much done. It is a great game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Well written with outstanding actors is the best way to describe this series. There are some life lessons to be discussed about the characters and their decision making for sure, especially if you are watching it with a young adult. The end of each episode leaves me ready to see the next and what happens next.
B0059GVB5I|5.0|The Blu-Ray transfer is nothing short of amazing!<br /><br />I can't add anything, review wise, to the gritty film masterpiece called `Last Exit to Brooklyn', that hasn't already been said. But having bought (and suffered through) the VHS and DVD transfers of `Last Exit to Brooklyn', I can honestly say that the Blu-Ray transfer is nothing short of amazing. And being priced so low, you really should treat yourself, and see this powerful film as it should be seen...in glorious Hi-Def! There is also a vintage two-part documentary included that is worth the price of `admission' by itself.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|The one thing I never have been able to figure out about this album is the cover photo.<br /><br />That isn't an El Camino.<br /><br />So why isn't the record called \\"Plymouth Voyager\\"?<br /><br />;)
B0090EJR1K|2.0|Sacha may have jumped the shark with his latest movie.  The movie really felt off and many of the jokes just weren't funny.
