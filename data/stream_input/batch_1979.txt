B0094K1WZE|1.0|Since i can not play this in HD via the website, I am giving it a one star review. Don't start getting all greedy now amazon, its not like you!!!
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|I noticed that the critique of this movie has not been all that good.  I must be living in a different dimension from everyone else.  This is by far the best science fiction movie of the last 10 years.  The story is incredible and so socially relevant and revealing that, I believe, it should have been nominated for an academy award.  This movie is spellbinding with special effects that are incredible and a storyline as good as any you would want.  The only thing close to this is I, Robot.  Of course, its not outer space nonsense with no consideration of the weakness and frailty of the human body in the hostile non-gravity, frigid environment of everyplace but Earth.  But it is a glimse of the future on this planet.  If your a Sci-Fi enthusiast, you have seen all of the major movies with this theme.  So, for great outer space monsters, try Screamers, The Hidden, Alien Raiders, any version of The Thing, and the scariest classic of them all: the 1956 version of Quatermass Xperiment.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I really liked this book so got another one immediately by this author.  A good message and interesting characters that bring it into contemplating our own ways of seeing.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I think that this game is so super super fun it is hard at some levels.but other than that I think that it is the best most fun game in the world
B007UXSPK2|1.0|Hard to judge it on any other realm..  We all know our expectations for acting or even directing tend to pretty low for \\"action\\" films..  but if you're not going to even bother spending a little extra time on the effects even on a relatively high budget film like this then what the hell?!!?<br /><br />But judging from many of the other reviews ...  I guess all you need to do is spend the budget on good advertising to convince the public that they like what they see.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love Solitare and this version runs smoothly.  I love that you can customize the cards and the play surface.  It's also very easy to switch between 1 and 3 card deal.
0812550706|3.0|Basic premise of the story, humanity almost overwhelmed by a superior enemy, enemy only staved off by a brilliant military commander 'Mazer Rackham'. New military leader needs to be created/trained to save the human race from further attack, children bred/isolated/harshly trained to produce a new hero.<br /><br />Most of this book was brilliant, exploring the moral implications of physically & mentally torturing children in order to produce the desperately needed military hero. Needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few etc. The suffering of the children & their motivations were well written & quite enthralling.<br /><br />However, towards the end of the book the story seemed to fall to pieces. There are massive holes in the plot. I'm used to poor endings in sci-fi books, but this was extreme. The last few chapters really let this story down. I feel the author had a moral tale to tell, and created a poor sci-fi story around it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this second book. Can't wait to read the third!  Nice trilogy to keep a reader's interest for some reading awesomeness
B002MQYOFW|5.0|More hunger games I love the book go Suzanne cc Collins on her amazing book that she wrote I loved it.

B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great Picture and Great Scene and Very Good Action Pack Film. Very Exciting Film with a lots of Action Drama.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|All of their hits on three CD's and at a reasonable price.  What more could you ask for?  A must have for any Rolling Stones fan.
1933492279|3.0|Cover of the book came off the moment I opened it.  Besides that, I appreciated the designs, the back story and execution of art.
B000UDNBQW|5.0|This book was a wonderful display or how one person can make a huge impact on someone's life. I read this as part of my \\"Around the World in 52 days.\\" I was not disappointed. The climax was a abrupt and without warning just like life at times. Loved the book within a book. A must read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing!!! This trilogy was the best out of all the books I have read over the years. Just simply amazing!
B0049P1VHS|3.0|Here is a classic case of a show feeling its way along from a great premise, and some interesting moments, to its much better groove (the succeeding season, seasons). Which could be said for so many other television shows. It usually takes quite a while to get the real creative juices going, doesn't it? Just to offer a few examples: how terrible were the first seasons of Star Trek: TNG, and the X-Files, respectively?<br /><br />The Walking Dead, Season One, really only proves how there is usually a freshman jinx involved with classic television shows. The opening episode, for example, is hardly original: we saw it all before in 28 Days Later, didn't we? A guy wakes up in a hospital only to find the world has become a post-apocalyptic zombie hellscape while he's been away. Some neat twists on the theme do not take away from the fact that it is a stolen idea. From more than one place, it turns out: Stephen King wrote similar scenes as this in The Stand. Remember Stu Redman?<br /><br />The rest of the season is not very surprising; various and sundry encounters with the undead and the presentation of survivors, none of which is particularly interesting. A low budget also meant a reliance on computer-generated graphics, so that the zombie deaths usually resemble something you could catch in a Resident Evil videogame.<br /><br />We never see the most interesting part of the apocalpyse, which is the transition from one world to the next. It's just the next, and you have to imagine the rest. Disappointing. Or rather, it did not have to be disappointing, but it is, due to a lack of originality.<br /><br />Today's audience is also accustomed to zombie horror, so that many of the scenes here, pivotal sequences in the episodes, just aren't very striking -- such as Rick's (the protagonist's) encounter with a hoard of undead in Atlanta. We've seen all of this stuff before, and so it is hardly worth a glance.<br /><br />And the fact is, if this was all the show turned out to be about, it would be terrible. Instantly forgettable. Like a toned-down version of Night of the Living Dead. And there would certainly be no reason to keep turning it on week after week.<br /><br />But it isn't just about zombies, that's the thing. It's about fully-developed, dramatically real characters inhabiting a zombie-world -- and that is new. Basically, what we have is the zombie universe treated for the first time since Romero's original film in the 60's as a serious stage on which the human condition can be played out.<br /><br />We quickly realize that this is less about the scares and the killing, the dim lighting and the horror, than it is about the people involved in it. The interest arrives with the elucidation of character (which does not happen enough here to earn a higher rating from me, but which does happen).<br /><br />Few of the scenes I liked involved zombies, actually. My favorite was the abandoned Dixon brother on the rooftop in Atlanta, his psychological struggle with God/fate/himself as he was dying of exposure. Very well done, a great performance based on the bedrock of a wonderful script. Romero never directed anything so beautiful. Other good ones involved Shane and Rick's emotionally divided son.<br /><br />The stories show glimpses of what they will eventually become, once the writers become fully immersed in the characters. Not great, but very good in certain instances, especially the dialogue. Not a lot of trite lines here, no signs of inexperienced screenwriters ...<br /><br />It's a very intelligent experience, overall, especially in the last few episodes. The lines given to the group's conscience, Dale, are frequently wonderful. Worth the price of admission. The over-arching themes of the series are introduced fairly well, and in a convincing manner. So again, it is not the zombie stuff that intrigues, but the deeper layers. For example, if there is no hope, if this is mankind's \\"extinction event,\\" then what, exactly, are these people plodding on for? And of course the survival of the body/versus the survival of the human soul thing (again embodied in many of Dale's dialogues).<br /><br />I only give it three stars because the setting is given preference here, instead of the characters ... because it is still all being set up. The show gleams wonderfully when it is about the characters and the choices they face, the loves and hatreds they habor. But it sinks when focusing on the \\"walkers.\\" Because again, we've seen all that before.<br /><br />But the writers are clever. They understand that before the viewer can give a damn about who gets eaten or attacked by a zombie, he/she must first become involved in a character's plight ... and in a movie? You just don't have time to do that sort of thing. A few minutes backstory per character, and you better hope you succeed, or the whole movie fails.<br /><br />Here they have time, and they take it. They build these characters brick by brick, and as convincingly as anything you'll find in even Emmy-award winning shows.<br /><br />But again, all is set-up, a finding of the way, a searching through fog-enshrouded trees for a proper path. It's a good start, but I maintain that only in the next season do they really begin to get it right.<br /><br />The final two episodes are disappointing, though intellectually stimulating. A CDC scientist, at the end of his tether, tries to murder the group, or encourage their mass suicide, however you choose to look at it. Either way, it's contrived. And almost certainly factually inaccurate, as far as the real CDC in Atlanta is concerned. It involves the destruction of the entire facility, when only the destruction of the labs (including any stores) would do. And the final blow-up is computer-generated nonsense, almost laughable in its look.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Very thought provoking book! It was hard to put down. I would think about the characters even when I wasn't reading the book.
0765325950|1.0|5 Stars - for the Wheel of Time series. This is a wonderful story and has truly been a blessing in my life.<br /><br />5 Stars, thanks, and hugs - to Michael Kramer and Kate Reading for their magnificent narration of the entire series.<br /><br />4 Stars - for the story in this final book. I thought it was good but not great. The ending felt rushed.<br /><br />1 Star - to TOR. I think TOR owes us a \\"thank you\\" for every single one of these one star reviews. Hopefully TOR and other publishers will take our feedback and learn from it. Their \\"product\\" is more than just words on a page but is also how it is delivered to the people who want to read it.<br /><br />...and finally 1 Star - to whoever allowed Harriet to make the final decision on delaying the release of the eBook to help preserve Robert Jordan's \\"legacy\\". For me it only tarnishes his legacy. By manipulating the system to favor himself over other authors it creates an unfair and unlevel playing field. It's like the professional athlete who uses performance enhancing drugs.<br /><br />It saddens me to see how these marketing decisions have soured so many fans on such a wonderful story and storyteller.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I started watching season 1 on netflix but they don't have season 2 and I came into it late in the season! I love that I can watch this on here for the same price I would pay for ITunes but it seems to be better quality. This show is amazing and I love the storybook characters so much! Can't wait for the Little Mermaid to show up!!!!!
B00A757EFW|3.0|not the full version. doesn't let you advance levels. prompts you to buy full version. easy to play, but as soon as you get into it you're game stops.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone who loves an amazing book that keeps you on your toes and that is exactly what Colleen Hoover has done with this book. I will not give spoilers because I feel that is a total injustice to you the reader. Just trust me when I say this book is truly MAGNIFICENT!! <3
B00004RJ71|5.0|Saw this movie when it first came out in the 1990' s. There was a lot of controversy and they had to change the name or something like that. it's a good movie that depicts the lives of some &#34;vatos locos&#34;.  it's about real life Chicano's growing up in the ghetto and making choices about family; blood and honor. I fell in love with Benjamin bratt in this movie.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is really a hard core science fiction novel with a terrific plot and detailed descriptions of how a really marooned astronaut on Mars survives. Potato farming with human excreta making oxygen from hydrazine communicating to Earth somehow and survivng! The technical details are very difficult to absorb sometimes and the profanities and swearwords make this a little uneasy reading but on the whole it is a real plausible  Scifi novel and must be appreciated . Coming to plausibility you can argue that this is also fantasy and how can someone do all this alone?But when we science fantasy writers think of aliens and mysterious Force and future scientific advances like time travel or human colonies on Mars to create fiction this writer has written entirely believable and make believe fiction of survival on Mars and really there are no aliens no creatures no domed colonies. Good indeed very good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|simple basic game of solitary. entertaining basic game. nothing fancy. plays just fine on my kindle fire HD. easy to download and play.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|Enough of those who reviewed have given the synopsis of the story, so I will focus on my experience of the movie...<br />I picked it up on a whim, not having read the book or even having heard of it.  I looked it over briefly, concluding that it was a mild mystery story that invites you, the viewer, to participate in a manner that could be a more serious version of clue.  I cannot explain why that thought came to me, but it was enough to come home and purchase it on Amazon the next time I was online.<br />I watched it two days ago and it lingers in my consciousness even now... Haunting and well done, I think, and while not what I expected, it exceeded my anticipation of a moderately entertaining movie-evening.  I have placed it on my topmost shelf of collected movies... I do not feel qualified to judge what might be a best movie or award winning, but it is thought and emotion provoking, causing me to reflect upon people I've known in my life and what their own stories might be.  Being a research-historian, I am drawn to such things anyway... I can relate to Julia's interest/obsession.  This will explain why I feel, even in a small way, connected to the story.  But the filme makes it believable and I heartily encourage you to experience it even if only once.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|it was a lot of tiles to clear, first time I didn't get it. I tried it again now I'm hooked. love it. makes my eyes and brain work.

159562015X|3.0|This book comes with a code that can not be reused.  My book unfortunately said it was new, and it had been returned in new condition, but the code had been used.  Best to just go to Target and get it for about $12 and check it out to confirm code is secure, or if you just need the test you can pay $10 online and get a code with all the benefits you will need for writing a class paper about your strengths.  The book just is just a good assessment guide after you have taken the quiz.
B000HF6XNG|5.0|it was the best movie i seen i would say watch it to se for yourself<br />i would tell all to watch it
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I had never seen the play before I purchased the CD.  It definately follows the storyline.  I now have several favorite tunes and have grown to love the musical.  It enhanced my enjoyment when I did finally see the play last summer and it is now a favorite in the car as I can visualize the sceens and sing along.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use - love the 15 day extended forecast! Would recommend to everyone for the Amazon Fire. A great app to use for planning long road trips.

B002ZG976U|5.0|I'm not much of a musical movie fan; however this was quite good. Great inside look at what burlesque is like. Wonderful acting. xTina does a wonderful job in this underated movie. Her song 'Bound to you' is beautiful and Cher's performance of 'You haven't seen the last of me, ' has become my all time favorit song Cher has performed!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I know these are a little outdated and yet out of  the 3 pairs I bought, I only have one left.  my daughter and grandson took two.  they stay in the ear and are very comfortable even if you fall asleep with them.
B000BNX3AU|5.0|I am a huge Diane Lane fan and this movie is terrific. It is great for women, and men, who need to understand that there is life after divorce. Highly recommended.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my dad and he loves it! He's always interested in WWII documentaries or books so when I saw this, I knew it would be a great addition to his collection. It comes with tons of DVD extras and additional documentaries aside from the series. Definitely worth the money.
B00003CXFV|5.0|I enjoyed Julia Robert's portrayal of Erin Brockovich. She did an awesome job. More than that this is a story about finding one's true purpose in life and making a difference in other's lives. To this day, Erin Brockovich continues to champion causes that others do not chose to touch upon! Well done movie and highly recommended.
B007HGPBRC|3.0|Christopher Hichens is a wonderful writer even though sometimes I find it hard to get into some of his thinking.  I have to read some then go off to something lighter and then come back to him.  Like him or not, he made you think.  He was dying at the time of writing this and makes you remember your own mortality.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Great movie with a great story line! The cast of actors was well chosen. The topic is all too familiar and it shows after all that when you are not looking for love it has a way of finding you!
B009JBZH54|5.0|The best Bluray Batman collection to date!  I love this collection.  Pefect for any Batman fan, a definite must have!  Will cherish over time.
B0017ANAZO|5.0|I am a Meg Ryan fan and this movie has a great cast of supporting actors. It's cute, funny and provides an all too familiar life challenge and how Meg Ryan choses to get around it all!! Great, uplifting movie for a woman!
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a fascinating story that was both interesting and driven. It helps the laymen to understand some basics about biological research but ties it into the human story intricately. Beautiful interesting story!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|It was great. But far from the best. a a a a a a a a a a a a
0765325950|5.0|From cover to cover, this book was nearly impossible to put down. The pacing was absolutely incredible, and while it loses something of Robert Jordan's descriptive flavor in doing so (I'm sure very few will complain about that), it made for an incredibly engaging read.<br /><br />The emotional highs and lows left me shouting for joy and weeping by turns, and there are plenty of both. From a character standpoint, the insights we gain into characters such as Moridin, Lanfear, and Logain are fascinating. Mat's narration is superb; I can't tell if RJ or Sanderson wrote his scenes, but whoever did brought an AK47 to a knife fight.<br /><br />Seeing the grand reveals of so many prophecies we've studied and debated and theorized was incredibly satisfying, especially because so many of them were fulfilled in unexpected ways. The final flaw of Callandor is revealed as a casual one-line bombshell, and a certain truth we held as fact was upended in an amazing scene that should have been blatantly obvious over half the series ago.<br /><br />The turning tides of Tarmon Gai'don run an emotional roller coaster of hope and despair. The tension is broken only very intermittently by brief but fantastic humor (looking at you, page 761).<br /><br />If I had one complaint, it would be that perhaps too much of the book is devoted to combat and not enough to characters; it would have been nice to have seen a little more of Moiraine and Nynaeve, for instance, and oddly, Androl and Pevara received a very large amount of screentime.<br /><br />Overall, the ending left me very satisfied. I was worried that I would always hunger for more Wheel once it finally turned, but I feel very content after reading A Memory of Light. It has been a wonder and an honor, but I can finally move on and be at peace for doing so.
B00304RMFE|5.0|Another excellent game from Halo. Only bad thing is that I cannot play LIVE since I do not have enough hard drive memory on my XBOX. The only way I can do this is to either purchase the memory drive for ~$130 or use thumb drives. Overall great game.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|im trying to understand all the different chapters/modes of angry birds. this makes me feel young again.thank you angry birds
B004EPZ07K|1.0|This movie was horrible. I can't believe I watched it. I don't think Hollywood realizes no one wants to see a bunch of special effects, a \\"fluff\\" script with no real story-line, and mis-cast/ cocky actors giving weak, garbage performances. It didn't even flow right and the editing was terrible. It was all over the place, and really a bit obnoxious. Based on this version, I still don't understand how or why Hal Jordan was chosen to be the Green Lantern? With the budget they had, I can't believe they couldn't make a more intelligent and creative movie. The Green Lantern(s) character has been around for over 70 years!-- come on! Thank goodness I didn't spend any real money to watch it-- it was on a free preview weekend on TV.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game. My friends introduced me to it and was the first app I downloaded on my kindle fire. 5 stars!

B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Can you say \\"instant replay!!!\\" So so so so so happy I bought this and got a really good deal fir this....I LOVE AMAZON!!
B007G5K066|5.0|Now, its never going to replace the BBC TV Series because you got more information from the original of 6 hours than<br />you can possibly get from an hour and a half, but the acting is amazing in this one too.<br />The old BBC Production had the best English Actor they could get AT THAT TIME.<br />I feel that they did the same thing with this movie version.  They got the best English actors they could AT THIS TIME.<br />They are all fantastic in this version and Gary Oldman was beyond brilliant.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This has been a fun series to watch.  The story is starting to loose a little momentum in season 3.  We will see where the story goes from here.
B002B2ZIES|5.0|Noah Hunt.  Love his voice (and that radiant smile).<br />KWS.  Love his talent and stunning guitar.<br />One of those albums I cannot live without.  And, like Ledbetter Heights, it is one I truly love to share with people who haven't listened to KWS before.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|The story line and presentation (animalistic survival of the fittest) did not work for me.  Would have rather seen the original.
B001PJ3SLI|5.0|This entire album is beyond the best.  And Deja Voodoo is one of my very favorite songs in the entire world.  KWS's music and Noah Hunt's voice (does any singer have a more beautiful smile??) are right up there on top of my all-time favorites list, too.  This is my second purchase of this CD - I literally wore my first one (purchased when it came out originally) out.  I tell so many people about KWS and encourage them to listen -- he's such a talented musician.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is ok. some of the games are hard to play on kindle.some of the games are fun. it is worth a try to download.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|Great Movie. Kids love it but adults can enjoy it too. Watch the extras to see some cool NASCAR footage.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read Colleen's books, \\"Slammed\\" and \\"Point of Retreat\\" and her signature is obvious in Hopeless. I couldn't put this book down. It gripped me from the beginning. I couldn't make sense of some of the beginning, but it all wraps up through out the journey of the book. And despite the sensitive subject matter that some other reviewers were complaining about, the subject was written in a very respectful and tasteful manner, (well as much as you can write about such a sensitive subject). I laughed, I almost cried if I wasn't in public when I was reading parts of it and by the end my heart was full.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this book and I hope this review helps make the deciding factor for you. You won't regret purchasing this book.
055380684X|5.0|Everyone should read this book. I know there is some controversy with what He says, but you can't argue that hard work that involves serious practice time are the keys to success.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|This CD is lacking so much its insane.  It is missing \\"Can You Hear the People Singing\\" and \\"Lovely Ladies\\".  It also skips several stanza in the songs.  In the song \\"At The End Of The Day\\", this recording skips several stanzas where Fantine explains her situation.<br /><br />If you are wanting to actually hear the play correctly, this isn't it.  Even if you are wanting the movie soundtrack, this is lacking.<br /><br />If you just want to get the song you heard out of your head then this is okay I suppose.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an intellectual romantic comedy. It's a feel good, laugh-out-loud movie.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Aerosmith is never a disappointment!  This cd is filled with new sounds that many years of listening will satisfy the soul!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|i don't get the 5-star reviews.  i couldn't even finish it.  it's all about 2 kids making out and then around 60% into it, i figured out what was going on with the girl.  sorry, but i was thinking i downloaded a cheesy, entertaining, romance movel.  child abuse is not entertaining and i don't want to read about it.  it's terrible enough it really happens to so many people, i don't need it in my 'entertainment'.

B00866JL96|4.0|Enjoyed this movie. Something you can watch many times. Very good Price. Comes with the ability to download to a computer
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I have not yet been able to view this but saw it in theatre. I LOVED the movie so I am sure I will LOVE this cd!
B009738XXM|5.0|I thought I would get a review before they deduct my money from my card but I guess not. I loved it though.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of his best books. I could not put it down. It takes an idea that you think would be the right thing to do and makes you see it is not so simple.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|A lot of people should have gone to jail over this scheme.  That some of these people are still involved in the financial system today shows how corrupt it is.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|This was a gift. It was delivered intact and we were happy with the purchase.  The recipient was very happy as well.
B001M3LG84|4.0|I like Andre Rieu's fine playing, his enthusiasm, good singers, well dressed players and his natural charm.<br />The DVD was first class.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Wanted a better battery tracker to figure out why my battery was not lasting so long. This showed me what apps used and that just having wifi on drains abit of power.
B00846REIS|4.0|Great. Start for this series. It was hard to get into at first after reading fifty shades of grey but after the slow beginning I was able to see this was going to be a good read.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Easy to use and keeps me informed and updated.  The apps version is just as helpful to us as the pc version.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love this game.<br />I'm so glad  I found this game both worlds are fun can't wait to play the second half.
0765325950|2.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the WOT novels, but this one was a disappointment.  It seems like Sanderson ignored the stories of Jordan's main characters in favor of some minor characters.  It's almost like Sanderson spent his time and words developing his own characters, instead of really taking the time to properly finish the stories of those WOT fans have come to love.  Sanderson also made some pretty major leaps at the end of the book without bringing his readers to the point they could understand, if not believe what happened.  If you have read all the other books this can be appreciated for what it is, a poor attempt to end one of the greatest epic fantasy series of all times, but unlike the other books this one is not a masterpiece in and of itself.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I played this game before and it was awesome I love ag<br />I played this game before and it was awesome
B004R63MWQ|5.0|They said it was a sequel but it mirrored the original movie. Also they did a very good job with this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It didn't go where I thought it would go, at all, but it had a very interesting turn. It was so hard not to be completely drawn to the story! I cracked up laughing so many times I can't even count, I felt the love, heartache, and the author made it so easy to get caught up in it. I even cried at times.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|it,s an interesting concept and rates well in terms of gameplay. there appears to be more updates coming and I await them with baited breath.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Worthy of the Bourne series. You will love it. Actually, it's my favorite thus far. I like Jeremy Renner much better than what's his name.
B00973902K|5.0|This is like soda pop rock.  It is fun, happy music.  Makes me want to jump up and down.  It's good stuff!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool series provides the reader with a full crafted world that is surprisingly easy for us to relate too.  In this world, the author has created a series of characters that a reader can easily identify with, including the villain of the series.  But he does it all with a lack of sentimentality I find refreshing.  Like the Silo itself, the writing is spare and paired down, the lack of adjectives reflecting the nearly monochromatic world that everyone lives in.  I'm looking forward to more.
B005VPP4WS|5.0|we both enjoyed lade gaga's hbo special and watched it several times. amazon had this dvd at a resonable price and it was a christmas present for her to enjoy anytime.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It keeps you wondering through the first half and then adds suspense throughout the second. Highly recommended!
B000FCKGPC|2.0|To many characters ,  very drawn out.  I was bored for the most part of this book.  I invested this much  into the story let's see how it ends..
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I called Amazon to tell them that my Kindle would not charge.  They suggested my cable needed to be replaced.  My Kindle was about 1 yr. old.  They offered to replaced it at no cost to me.  Now, it charges and in a timely fashion.  Thank you!
140525355X|5.0|My sons absolutely love this book series. I read it every night and they never get bored. I ordered this with the expectation it'll come 1month later from Germany but it arrived just before Christmas! Perfect. Thank you very much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Once I started reading it I didn't want to put it down. I can't wait to read the next book.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Nice graphics, decent story, and a nice mix of puzzles and searches.<br /><br />A few complaints. First, some objects are very small and too close to the edge of my Fire screen making them difficult to pick up. Second, some objects are hidden underneath the top bar making them impossible to find without the hint button. Even then, as the object flashes on top of the bar, you have to tap it very quickly.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had was the dragon puzzle, until I read a review that said they turned off the timer. That puzzle is too complicated to be done in eight minutes. That might seem like a generous amount of time, but it wasn't for me. Once I turned the timer off, I was able to solve the puzzle and the rest of the game became more enjoyable as well.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll be playing it again. I like to see if I can remember where the hidden objects are and how to do the puzzles.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I can't think of anything bad to say about it. Lots of data. Easy to use. Would be nice if the app would sync with home weather station, but that's just nitpicking.
B008DL466C|1.0|Should've given these beats to Kendrick Lamar instead. The beats made the album wholeheartedly. Is there even an official instrumental album out for this?
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I cant get enough of this game.Ill play till my kindal battery is dead!!!charge it and right Back to playing!<br />I love this game!!!
B008FPOIT6|2.0|Closer to young adult fiction than serious writing. Thin characters, contrived plot, subpar prose. A plot that's not fully flushed out. Don't waste your time.
0790729644|5.0|A fine Western indeed with a pretty good cast, with Gene Hackman as the villain and Clint Eastwood as the anti-hero. Hackman plays the brutal sheriff &#34;Little Bill&#34; while Eastwood plays the retired gunman William Munny, I really don't want to spoil the movie so I'll let you guys watch it for yourselves.
0345529057|5.0|Dear George RR Martin, Stop distracting yourself with other stuff and GET ME THE NEXT 2 BOOKS PLZKTHXBUHBYE.<br /><br />Story is fantastic, world is incredibly detailed and the characters are deep. If you like books where the hero always wins and the bad guy is always the bad guy, don't buy this series. Reading this story has provided me with such visceral emotions. There were,  no less than 2, occasions I wanted to throw these books away.<br />Once during the first book and once during the third book. (Ned and RW for those in the know....)  I can't say I have ever felt so strongly in reading a book that I had to press on. I love....love love love this series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not usually the type of book I would read at all but I was gripped from the first chapter and couldn't put it down. I loved it and will look for more of her books.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Book number  2  was great.... some times I had a tough time following, reminds me of a mother tween series book number  2, looking forward to beautiful chaos
B0062OCNAI|4.0|Well written. I found myself looking forward to getting back to it. I enjoyed her first book too. Hoping for another :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so well written. I could not put it down. Finished in less than 2  days. I can usually see what's coming in books so I'm not surprised easily but there were a couple of big surprises in this book that I did not expect. I loved every page.
B005RJ6AIK|4.0|I love Hawaiian music but not too much singing..thus CD has just enough singing..hubby loves it, though &  we play it, along with Jeff Peterson & Ledward Kap... a lot.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Wonderful cast. Demonstrates to those who are not seniors that life does not stop just because you reach 65 plus. And to seniors, demonstrates that you don't have to curl up and let the world go by.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|Great series i read the book in two days and loved it. It is pretty suspenseful and at some times funny
B006Z7Z3S6|1.0|Borinnnnnnng. nothing happens until the last 25 minutes. Why. Ti. Why. This had potentinal. From the poster alone it looked awesome. But no. Its not. I really wish i would've chose to Sleep instead of watching this at 4 am. Please Ti, in your next film(s) stop with the dialog heavy, boring scenes and typical fake scares.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|The story line was pointless, slow, and a waste of time I could have spent staring at the wall. The over-the-top violence was unnecessary. The nudity and explicit sexuality of a girl who is supposed to be 12 was creepy and inappropriate.
B005JS7W4K|5.0|Buckley's first five albums are, in my opinion, his best. His first, which I believe he recorded at the age of 19, demonstrates the mellifluous voice and Hello and Good-bye continues in the folk-rock vein as Larry Becketts talents as a lyricist unfold. 'Morning Glory' became an instant classic. Then with Happy Sad Tim went from folk-rock to folk-jazz. His band with congas, vibes, stand-up bass and jazz guitar set the background for Tim's vocal acrobatics. This and the following two albums manifested Buckley's voice-as-an-instrument style and his tremendous vocal range. Blue Afternoon, a collector's item in and of itself, may be my favorite but that's a tough call. Happy Sad has the fabulous 'Gypsy Woman' and Lorca features cool stroll of 'Driftin'. The fact is these are five great albums at a nice price.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow.  What twist and turns. You don't know which one to cheer for.  Neither I guess. They deserve each other.
B000FC0ZAI|5.0|enjoyed book, love it that you have it with you on kindle and phone . Its just the best!<br />Book is good
B000000XBA|5.0|between 1968 and early 1972,CCR rolled out 13 top 40 songs, which still stand as the most impressive run of hits made by an American band.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I liked the movie but I was very dissatisfied with the service. Several times when I was watching the movie, it made requests for streaming data. It didn't matter where I was at in the movie it always reset to 2:34 (the very beginning). Amazon needs to do a better job in not having it lose your place in the movie as it is annoying to fast forward to the spot you were watching it at.
B000002U82|5.0|This album was a step forward for this English band who was learning all the time. The techniques of recording were better.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This application is one of the most helpful apps I have ever downloaded. It reminds me daily to read my Bible and It offers high quality reading plans.

B008F5YDRI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie!!! The story-line was different and unique.Love Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor.I will highly recommend this movie.
B000002UA9|5.0|The Beatles recorded 10 of these 14 songs on their debut album at EMI's Abbey Road studio in just over 12 hours.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|very, very enjoyable read.  wonderful imaginative story with a very identifiable main character, katniss.  very glad i read it before seeing the movie.  so much background for movie scenes would have been missed if hadn't read first.
B000003CMB|5.0|Rock's greatest live double LP is an unbeatable testimony to the Allman Brothers' imporvisational skills, as well as evidence of how they connected with audiences to make jamming feel communal.
B003O86FMW|5.0|harder to focus on but all 'middle' parts of great stories are.  took a while to get through since it seemed nothing different was happening - until the end
B00004W50T|5.0|&#34;Big Pink&#34; was a pink house in Woodstock, New York, where the Band -  Bob Dylan's backup band moved gto be near Dylan after his motorcycle accident.
B000Q79HS8|3.0|The bourne movies have you coming back for more.  But, this second one is another typical plot of everyone is innocent and the real bad guy is a retiring american spook who is really the bad guy because he does not want to retire poor.  I wish Hollywood could do something more realistic but just as entertaining in the \\"spy motif\\" without it always being a corrupt American official who is really behind all the human suffering and evilness that is happening.  But, the producer of this movie was good in that he kept you from knowing this was the typical plot line of bad corrupt american official and everyone else are innocent victims until much later when it already too late to stop.  You already have eaten half of your big bucket of popcorn.  Well one twist to this plot, a Russian is also a bad guy.  Wait, it is the evil corporation who is part of the corruption, but not an evil american corporation.  So this is a little bit of an improvement.  Do not rent this for more than $1.
B005EYP8PO|5.0|After fostering a solemn public image for years, U2 loosened up on Achtung Baby, a prescient mix of sleek rock and ulsing Euro grooves.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I love this game, but what the heck happened to the app icon?  It looks like someone took a picture of a PC game box!!!! Why?  Please change it back to the way it was.  This icon looks so stupid.  I'll be removing it from my favorites until it looks right, again.<br /><br />Update:  Thanks! The app icon is back to normal! :)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I bought this app because it was free and I liked the idea of being able to know how much battery life I had remaining. It does a great job with this function and also has other handy features such as detailing how you are using your kindle 's hard drive space.  It also has a very attractive interface. It's a great functional app.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Very well written Jacee Dugard. Wow, moving and powerful book. Very sad that a child of any age or a person of any age should have to experience such a thing. I thought about this book continually all day as I was reading it. Stayed with me long after the pages were read. I am so very sorry that anyone had to live like that. That guy is one sick monster.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|Great transition into getting back on track since Khan left. They haven't missed a beat and quite frankly, it shines rather brightly when compared to the other fantastic Kamelot offerings of old(er).
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This was one of those movies that I wanted to see but wasn't in a hurry to buy because I didn't honestly think I would like it that much.  Well I ended up red boxing it with my sister (9 years old also loved!) one night and then I just had to buy it the next day!  I son't know what I loved about it so much! It just had everything action, romance, and some laughs.  DEFINITELY worth buying!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My daughter, age 45, loves Angry Birds and has been playing it on her phone for a long time.  She got ahold of my Kindle Fire and downloaded Angry Birds.  Played it around 6 hours before putting it down.  I also like to play angry birds so this will be a great addition to the games on my Kindle Fire.  Also good for my 8 and 14 year old grandkids.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|Peter Sellers outdoes himself in this masterpiece of Kubricks. Takes an incredibly serious subject and by satire makes a take a hard look at how close we came.<br /><br />My only suggestion as a companion piece purchase &#34;Fail-Safe&#34;.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I hadn't played chess in years and was pretty sure that anything would beat me. But this app really is all levels and the beginner level worked great. In no time I was up to moderate. Game looks great too.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|It was lovely to reconnect with the characters, and the next generation of Fall of Giants. Such a richly woven tapestry of thier interactions and seperate developments throughout that tumultuous period of the 2nd World War. Follett brings the history of that time, with all its horrors, depravations, hopes, loves and shattered dreams, so sharply in focus you live it with them all. History comes alive and you emerge with less polarised opinions. A hugely satisfying book in every way.
B003G4W49C|4.0|What a game or is it a game? Worth the time to read and find out. I will have to read on to the next book to satisfy my curiosity.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I love this App.  I love music and this App is very User friendly.  I have recommend it to my family.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I Thought Was good and very well acted and a good storyline, still waiting for the 3rd season that I pre-ordered
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Great movie about the values of life - faith, honor , courage, and helping others achieve their dreams :). Loved every minute of it !
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is poor writing. The subject matter was a headliner. How many talented authors are passed up because they wrote a real a real story.
0345803485|4.0|Obviously I finished the first book of 50 shades of gray, WOW! it was soooo good, not just the obvious reasons. It was so well written and a lot of fun even with the subject matter that it contains. The porn parts where done in really good taste even, the characters so well written I couldn't be annoyed or dismissive of any of them. Very well done.<br /><br />P.S. I LOVE THE INNER GODDESS! don't change a thing
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I have to share how FRUSTRATING the bezel on the face of this Garmin.  I bought my son this watch for Christmas.  After waiting for two different shipping charges and locations, we were BEYOND DISAPPOINTED!  My son could not set it after an hour and we finally had to let it loose full charge in order to reach the menu again- my son finally asked, why didn't you just get me the forerunner like yours mom?&#34;  3 buttons that do it all- this is way too much of a waste of time and frustrating - send it back!  Have every intention on doing so!
B002NZK5TG|5.0|I got this for my girls so when we do road trips they have something new to them.  They really enjoyed it.  Kept them quite so I was very happy.
B00782O7IY|5.0|The Artist:  This was one of my all time favorite movies.  It's amazing what they did with a silent film.  No wonder it won so many awards.  I  purchased two copies for Christmas gifts and one for myself.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|It is great, and arrived in time for Christmas viewing. Will plan to watch every Christmas as a family tradition.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|This is my first Nicholas Sparks novel and I'm sorry to say I was extremely disappointed. I was looking for a light holiday read and this sounded perfect. Unfortunately, Sparks does not construct any chemistry between the main characters, thus I was left not really caring about the budding romance, and finished it not because I wanted to, but  simply for the sake of getting it out of the way. This is such a shame, as the main character 'Katie' was quite well drawn out, I felt sympathetic towards her and wanted her to succeed. I have read so many more better (and cheaper) 'light-read' romances, by less established writers, I would advise you to look elsewhere than 'Safe Haven'.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it is lots of fun i like all the leavels and how easy and yet how hard it can be
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator. Keys are big making it very easy to  on the kindle fire. It is also very pleasant looking
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|it is great i had a lot of fun useing this app it is really fun to see how far you can go
B00979CS50|5.0|I love it when Neil gets together with Crazy Horse.  I love to listen to the long jams.  Great to drive long distances to.  Wish I could hear it on one of Neil's systems.

B003WE9TU8|5.0|Just don't read it before bed!! haha It will give you epic dreams. But really its the best zombie book out there!

B0085A9J18|5.0|It was on his christmas wish list,so i ordered it. he was very happy with it therefor i am very happy with it.
B0026IUXME|5.0|A blend of art and reality which makes this movies one of its kind. I will recommend it. I have never seen one like this in a longtime
1401233066|5.0|It was on his christmas wish list,so i ordered it. he loved it therefor i am very happy with it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i'm not usually a huge fan of first-person narratives, but collins does a great job of keeping the story going and not becoming too introspective.  i read the next two novels too and, while they are also fantastic and highly recommendable, the main character unfortunately does become a bit too introspective for my taste.  that said, i appreciate the way collins writes the character, because she seems realistically obsessed given her age and situation.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I got the movie right after purchasing it and was able to watch it immediately. Super cute movie! Easiest way to watch movies.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I loved how quirky this book; such a pleasure to read.  It wasn't &#34;awesome&#34; like the best book ever, but I would definitely recommend to pick it up!
B0083F5ITW|5.0|The song &#34;one more night&#34; is on this and it is the reason I bought the Cd for my daughter. Great price too and fast shipping. We're very happy.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is a very well written show. The characters have depth and all of the main characters are played by very good actors consistently great in their roles.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry returns the same incorrigible detective... his stubborn nature and sense of justice governing his investigative style making enemies of those with political agendas.  Always fighting for the victim... love it!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun game that makes you use your brain.  i recommend it to anyone.  have fun and enjoy the awesome game.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Nicholas Sparks is undoubtedly a fantastic storyteller.  However, this one felt formulaic and all to predictable.  I won't quit reading him in the future... but I do hope he can come up with better.
0307591549|5.0|Loved it!  Full of amazing studies done on the mental and physical benefits of being happy.  Highly recommend it, is a fascinating book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I never read books like this.  My friend told me to read it.  I downloaded it into my kindle in April and never read it.  The house was sick with the stomach bug, so I decided to read it.  I couldn't put it down!!!  This book has done wonders for my marriage! LOL!
B000B8L6LI|5.0|This system is easy to use, anyone that can follow simple direction can put a very good edge on a knife. With little effort it will shave hair off your arm. I added an extra fine ceramic stone which takes it to a different level. Know I easily put a razor edge on my buck lock blade. It shaves with no effort. Left arm missing a lot of hair testing knives. I would suggest this system to anyone that wants to sharpen knife simple and consistent.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|So honestly, I think this book is more appropriate for teenage girls.  It was a really long book, with an unexpected twist that made the entire thing not romantic.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was wonderful! It had so many exiting adventures and different and creative ideas in it....it was absolutely the most wonderful adventures book I have ever read and really enjoyed it!!!
B00A757EFW|1.0|I LOVE playing pac-man ~ but this game is &#34;stuck&#34; on my Kindle, and I can't get rid of it, or make it work.  Definite problem.  I removed it from my account on Amazon, but it is still on my Kindle.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a great boom. I couldn't put it down!!<br />So many twists make it one if the best observer read.
1932100660|5.0|The bottom line is just because it is said does not make it so. Don't be so quick to take the medias word about what they report. Many times they don't follow thru to give you the whole story or how it was researched or by whom or who released the information.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it! Even though it took me forever to decide to finally read it, I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the others.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The twists and turns in the novel are wonderfully wrought.  The characters are alternately likable and despicable.<br />Gillian Flynn is a skilled author.  Gone Girl is worth the read.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This book was very sad yet moving and told a story without telling it at all. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in dramas.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This should be at least 10 stars!  I rate books based on how eager I am to get home from work and fire up my Kindle.  This book had me reading every spare second that I had - on my iPhone, on my computer, and in all kinds of strange places.  The topic seemed far-fetched, but after reading the sample, I was hooked.  Mr. Howey's writing is amazing, and I really enjoyed the lack of typos and other editing mistakes that take me out of the story.  His silos mirror society on a larger scale, but give one hope for change.  He does an amazing job of character development, and as the stories unfold, you care more and more about them.<br /><br />After reading the Omnibus, I am going to have to change my rating system.  If this is what five stars look like, I'm going to have to be a lot stingier in the future about what books get that many!<br />I WANT MORE!
B004I744AS|5.0|I am a college student, working on some homework &amp; the first time I used the app, I quickly found exactly what I was looking for...  thank you!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I just finished this story, and can't figure out why it's been on the best-seller list for so long.  To me, it was an OK read, but I absolutely loathed both of the main characters.  That isn't what make it just OK, though - I've read thousands of books, and haven't liked the main characters before, but enjoyed the read.  Maybe it was just that both of them were so totally self-involved, superficial, selfish, and mentally ill that it was difficult to care about the outcome for either one of them.  They certainly deserved what they got.  For me, they are an unflattering picture of what so many younger people (35 and under) have become in today's society, and except for wanting to know which one of them 'won,' I wouldn't have finished it.
B004H4XLJM|4.0|This book appears to be excellent.  However I realized as soon as I opened it that I made a serious mistake ordering the Kindle edition.  The book is quite dependent on the CD that comes with the paper edition, and there is no web site to separately download the CD files.  Thus you pay almost as much as the hard copy and lose much of the functionality.
B003QSOE0U|5.0|I have seen this movie several times. I liked it because of the love story part of it, not just what happened at Pearl Harbor.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is an addicting game...you can't put down.  Easy to advance levels .  Easy download.  I would easily recommend this game.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I couldn't find this particular LEGO Friends in the stores, and I really liked it! It was a gift for my niece who likes to build things but also likes little play animals and people. LEGO Friends is the best of both of these things!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Have Avast on my desktops and laptops....great program....updates automatically....and now I have it on my Kindle Fire. Working beautifully and gives me security I need. Recommend highly.

B00APUYWYA|4.0|I wanted a teen sports/competitive drama with some decent funny bits. That is exactly what I got if you consider acapella competitions a sport. Watch when you're missing your high school/college days. Don't watch if you have a migraine.

0316228532|2.0|I gave this a lower rating because it took me very long to read. I usually get through books pretty quickly. It is a good book, but it is NOT Harry Potter. It is very difficult to read a book by J.K. Rowling and not have Harry in it.

B003YGSLDA|4.0|Have also been disappointed by movies re-released on blu-ray before. Was expecting something mildly better than my memories of watching it on VHS. But this was a surprise no film grain, dust or scratches image quality was as good or better than any move released in the last 10 years.<br /><br />Also after 25 years reminded me of a similar TV movie &#34;The Night They Saved Christmas&#34;.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|First off, I'd like to say that I have never used a $60+ gaming mouse, so I don't know what the top end gaming mice are like. I do know, however, that this is the best mouse I have ever used.<br /><br />First off, the feel of the mouse is fantastic. With the high DPI (and a lower sensitivity so your mouse doesn't jump around like crazy), the mouse moves so incredibly smoothly and is incredibly precise. I have medium-sized hands, and it fits in my palm perfectly. I can see it working well for someone with large hands. Smaller hands might have a little trouble, but that just depends. The plastic that it is made of never sticks to my hands, and there is a nice rubbery grip where your thumb goes. Not only that, but the mouse comes with 8 weights that you can add or remove to adjust the weight of the mouse. At first I thought the three thumb buttons would be too easy to press because they stick out so far, but fortunately I was wrong. They are almost perfectly placed. The middle one is by far the easiest to press, but the other two aren't inconvenient or anything. Also, the scroll wheel feels great and doesn't click too easily, nor is it too hard to press.<br /><br />The four DPI settings on the mouse are awesome because you can set what each DPI level is, and you can also tell the software how many levels you want active. So if you only want two DPIs to switch back and forth between, then you can tell the software that.<br /><br />Speaking of the software, it is fantastic. You can alter all 9 buttons on the mouse to whatever you want, you can change the color of the anchor symbol to whatever you want (no changing the blue glow of the mouse wheel or DPI LEDs though), change DPI settings, sensitivity settings, polling rate, and a few other settings. And after all that, you can set up 2 different profiles which you can switch with a button on your mouse.<br /><br />Overall, if you're thinking of purchasing a gaming mouse, I would highly recommend getting this one. It is very well made. The cord is braided and the USB port is gold-plated so it will more than likely last quite a long time.

B0087EVHVW|5.0|I bought this for a budget gaming build. I had read a lot about the new Ivy Bridge Core i5 CPU's and really liked what I saw. I am an IT tech by profession, and know a good component when I see it. I work with all types of PC's and Mac's with all types of hardware configurations and I will say that the fastest and most reliable machines run the Core i5 and i7 CPU.<br /><br />This is the newest 3rd generation Core i5 CPU, LGA 1155 socket. It's a quad core with 4 threads at a speed of 3.2 GHz with Turbo Boost of 3.6 GHz, 6 MB of L3 cache, and runs on Intel's Ivy Bridge architecture, built on the latest 22nm process. It also features on-die Intel HD 2500 graphics which runs at 650 MHz and up to 1 GHz, so there's no need for a separate graphics card. You get all the features of the older Sandy Bridge CPU' s and more like lower power consumption of 77w TDP, vPro and VTx virtualization capability, and Turbo Boost 2.0. The bus speed is 5 GT/s, and you can run the latest storage technology and configurations with it like native PCI-e 3.0 x16, USB 3.0, 32 GB of 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM in dual channel, and RAID in SATA III 6 GB/s (with appropriate chipset of course). This isn't a \\"K\\" series CPU, so it's not fully unlocked so you can't tweak the voltage or multiplier or frequency easily like on the K series, and there is no hyper threading, only available on the i3 dual core and i7.<br /><br />My system has an ASRock H77 Pro4M motherboard, 8 GB (2x4 GB) Kingston HyperX 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM, Gigabyte 2 GB GT 650 Ti OC, Western Digital Black SATA 6 GB/s hard drive, and it runs like a champ. Very, very fast performance. Windows 7 Pro 64 bit installed in under 15 minutes and everything runs very fast. It runs basically as fast as the Ivy Bridge i7-3770 in most cases. Incredible power for under $200. It will outperform an 8-core 16 thread FX-8350 in nearly every task, aside from heavy duty 3D rendering, but if you're doing that, just get an i7 with hyper threading. Everything runs great, and even with the discreet card disconnected, it runs very good even in light gaming with the on-die graphics, although you won't get stellar performance even at low setting on modern games.  It also runs very cool even under load, so that means the fans stay quiet. It barely gets pushed under normal use. You'd need to run a game on max settings or benchmarks to make this break a sweat.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say it's as close to the perfect middle-of-the-road CPU out there. I'd choose it over the 2400, 2500's too. Extremely fast, uses a fraction of the voltage as an FX, and is very affordable. Leaves a FX-8150 in the dust, and for most applications, is faster than an FX-8350. It's also very future-proof as Intel is leaning heavily on the 22nm Ivy Bridge configurations for it's CPU's now, and I can't see that changing for quite some time. Pair this with a 7-series chipset motherboard, 8 GB RAM, and a competent graphics card and you have the makings of a fantastic gaming machine that won't cost you a boatload of money! On a side note, even though it's not fully unlocked, if you really wanted to, you can overclock this...I have heard of a 6 MHz bump in the base clock to 106, bumping the stock turbo boost max to 4.0. Not much, but could probably be more with added voltage, but It's already fast enough and I can't justify messing with it.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Very affordable<br />Ivy Bridge architecture<br />22nm process<br />Native support for 1600 MHz 25 GB/s dual channel RAM, 6 GB/s SATA RAID and PCI-e 3.0<br />Low 77 W TDP<br />5 GT/s bus<br />Beats the FX series<br />Support for Intel 7 series chipsets (H77, Z77)<br />Runs very cool<br />Will run with the i7's for some applications!<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />No hyper threading<br />HD 2500 GPU is only adequate<br />Not fully unlocked<br /><br />I can't really find anything wrong with this chip. It offers the best of speed and affordability. I would choose it over an i7 and save $130. It's not unlocked, but that doesn't really matter as it's ridiculously fast for a sub-$200 CPU. If you want unlocked, spend the extra $35 and get the i5-3570K or 2500K. The graphics are weak, but for most of us, they are perfectly adequate.<br /><br />Great CPU. Unbeatable for $185! Get one and you won't be disappointed.at doesn't really matter as it's ridiculously fast for a sub-$200 CPU. If you want unlocked, spend the extra $35 and get the i5-3570K or 2500K.

B003G4W49C|5.0|At first I did not want to read it because I did not think any book could live up to the expectations that I had for it. Few things do. I was proven so wrong. It was just as wonderful as everyone said it was. I read it in half the time I usually spend on books at its level.<br /><br />I will continue to suggest this book as it was suggested to me for a long time to come.

0765325950|5.0|Those who have finished the book will get the reference in my title. For those that haven't read it, these words describe the book well. Other good words include: triumphant, amazing, and inspiring.<br /><br />It's a really, really good book and the perfect conclusion to the Wheel of Time series.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't think it was possible for Sanderson to pull this off. Not because he's a bad writer (quite the opposite - he's a great author who can move plots along very fast), but because the world simply didn't seem ready for The Last Battle. In the middle of the previous book, Rand, Mat and Perrin were still tooling around the countryside, doing their things, and the trollocs had yet to even march out of the Blight.<br /><br />But it does happen - and it doesn't seem forced. Sanderson weaves together the story of every major named character in the finale (even Bela!), ties it up well, and makes it tremendously moving, to boot.<br /><br />Confession: I like Sanderson's portrayal of some of the characters (especially Nyneave) better than Jordan's. His versions are... more reasonable.

B000R4SMCW|5.0|This is a first-rate psychological thriller. The story concerns aeronautical engineer Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) who finds out that his wife, the beautiful Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz) is having an affair. We see her lover only briefly before Crawford shoots Jennifer in the head because of her infidelity. He call for Lt. Robert Nunally (Billy Burke) to investigate. Nunally is shocked to discover Jennifer's body for it is he who is her lover. But Jennifer is not actually dead but rushed to hospital in a coma. Arrogant but highly successful D.A. prosecutor Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) is assigned to prosecute the case which seems to be a forgone conviction. But then the difficulties arise.<br /><br />Crawford decides to handle his own defence. His confession it now emerges was obtained by Nunally and is therefore inadmissible. The gun that Nunally took away from the scene is not the gun that shot Jennifer. So there is no murder weapon and no shell casings. The charge against Crawford is eventually dismissed for lack of incriminating evidence. But then there are a couple of major twists to the tale. See the film to find out how it turns out!!

Nothing can happen, except in the Now, so the Now is all that really matters.<br /><br />Take a look!

B00AJRQLTI|5.0|As a big fan of the Les Mis musical, I wasn't sure how much I would like to hear stars sing the classic musical numbers instead of trained singers.<br />Happily, I found this version of the soundtrack to be both moving and enjoyable. The stars, while occasionally struggling with the more difficult numbers, more than make up for it with sheer emotion and energy. In particular, Hugh Jackman's &#34;Valjean's Soliloquy&#34; and Anne Hathaway's &#34;I Dreamed A Dream&#34; really deliver an amazing range of feelings.<br />I love Les Mis, I love the movie, and I love this soundtrack! (I only wish they had more of the great songs from the film in there, but still- amazing!)<br />Definitely worth getting if you are a fan of the movie or just want to hear some very emotional, if not technically perfect, renditions of the music.

B007G51UV0|5.0|In short, this motherboard is sweet. Buy it and you won't be disappointed. HOWEVER, heed my warning about RAM:<br /><br />I ordered this motherboard when I first started to build my desktop. I had 32 GB of RAM at my disposal (4 sticks of 8 GB each) and I believe that's the max this motherboard can support. So when I was assembling my computer, I loaded all 4 sticks of RAM onto the board. At the initial startup, the motherboard cycles through the different connections to make sure everything was hooked up properly -- and this cycle continued to fail at the RAM part of the sequence. I moved around my RAM sticks and tried every possible combination in all of the slots, but it would not start up. However, when I removed one stick of RAM (dropping my total memory to 24 GB), the startup launched and I was able to go ahead and install my operating system.<br /><br />So I exchanged it for a new unit because I already bought 32 GB of RAM and I actually wanted to use it. (Huge shout-out to the Amazon exchange policy! They had the new unit at my doorstep in 2 days and gave me a month to return the malfunctioning one!) I tried it out with the new motherboard (launching it with 32 GB from the beginning). Same problem. It would continue to give me a warning at the RAM part of the initial test cycle and wouldn't start up. At that point I was pretty much ready to admit defeat and just sacrifice the RAM I had. So I pulled out one stick of RAM, let the computer boot up for the first time, and it worked just fine with 24GB of RAM.<br /><br />But after the initial boot up, I made one last attempt at the 32 GB by turning off the computer, adding in the last stick of RAM, and booting it up again. And... IT WORKED! For some reason, I couldn't get past the INITIAL boot with 32 GB, but once the first boot was complete, the 32 GB was recognized and worked flawlessly. This leads me to believe that the first unit I had may have had the same problem and I could have made this fix work without returning it.<br /><br />So my advice to anyone who wants 32 GB of RAM: get past the first boot up with less than 32 GB. Then AFTER the first boot up, add in the rest of your RAM and it should work. :D

B005LAIGF0|5.0|As a child on a family trip in the 1970s, I saw a motorcycle speed past with a teenage couple. A car was making a u-turn and the motorcycle slammed into it, the teenagers taking flight onto the cement. I screamed and my parents stopped to assist the pair, who were sitting on the road, faces and jeans covered in blood. The kids were fine, but I have never forgotten the traumatic scene. I was reminded of this when watching \\"Margaret,\\" Kenneth Lonergan's epic 2011 film, as seemingly out of nowhere a similar incident takes place on the streets of New York City. One of life's mysteries is the unexpected emergence of tragedy, appearing as rapidly as the funnel of a tornado. Sometimes no one is to blame, a terrible truth difficult to grasp.<br /><br />When viewing \\"Margaret\\" for the first time, I was fortunate to have no preconceived notions. Its unique structure created a rare sensation of being unable to predict the outcome. This is a brilliant masterpiece, audacious and deeply inspired. Longeran, the writer and director, has dared to be great with the kind of project reminiscent of filmmakers of the 1970s. As I later learned, \\"Margaret\\" was filmed in 2004, but Lonergan became obsessed in the editing room, unable to achieve a final cut. Lonergan was trapped by a maddening vision in the great tradition of Sam Peckinpah ([[ASIN:B001JJ11VS Major Dundee]]), Francis Ford Coppola ([[ASIN:B008Y5FNL4 Apocalypse Now [HD]]]) and Werner Herzog ([[ASIN:B00001ODHV Fitzcarraldo]]). Such a quest produces the kind of art \\"Margaret\\" represents. Ahab goes after a whale. Herzog transports a boat. Lonergan, an unlikely existential madman, goes after life's meaning in post-911 New York.<br /><br />Okay, so this film remained in hiatus for years, finally reaching theaters in 2011. I knew none of this when viewing it, and was stunned by unexpected greatness. Lonergan's previous film was [[ASIN:B000I9W2M2 You Can Count On Me]], a wonderfully-acted independent drama perhaps a tad overrated. Andthen came \\"Margaret,\\" and Lonergan may well have destroyed his career. No matter, this film plays like Chekhov, a visionary work with many questions and few answers. I'm amazed by the negative reviews and realize critics were aware of the film's troubled background. Luckily, I was blissfully ignorant.<br /><br />In one of the great performances, Anna Pacquin plays Lisa Cohen, a budding high school teenager who fatefully witnesses urban tragedy. She represses the trauma and for the remainder of the 150-minute film (another version runs three hours) she attempts to come to terms with its deadly consequences. The trauma festers, bubbling to the surface in fits of anguish. Pacquin's character, tortured by guilt, wants to do the right thing even if there is no clear answer as to what is \\"right.\\" Lonergan is perhaps creating a parable for the New York terrorist attacks, followed by America's war with Iraq, or viewers can take it for something else -- a coddled though clever New York teen in serious need of therapy.<br /><br />But the film is so well made, I'm of the belief Lonergan was on to something. Perhaps one of the hard truths of life is our own insignificance within the universe, where unexpected tragedy can strike at any time. We have no power over such occurrences, and justice oftentimes does not exist. Once such a truth is realized, have we lost the innocence of childhood? If this sounds like a brooding novel, that's because \\"Margaret\\" plays like one.<br /><br />It's difficult to categorize this drama, but I was reminded of the works of Michael Haneke ([[ASIN:B000SIWHAK The Michael Haneke Collection (The Piano Teacher/Funny Games/Code Unknown/The Castle/Benny's Video/The Seventh Continent/71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance) (7pc)]], [[ASIN:B00386OWUC The White Ribbon [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B007R5JCNM Cache (Hidden)]]). One of our greatest living directors by way of Austria, his morose films never follow convenient paths, with shocking violence erupting at unexpected moments. His thought-provoking dramas are as unsettling as a Droog humming Beethoven. Lonergan has dared to tread similar turf.<br /><br />\\"Margaret\\" is supported by an extraordinary ensemble cast including Mark Ruffalo, Jean Reno, Matt Damon, Matthew Broderick, Kieran Culkin and Rosemarie DeWitt, each with crucial moments providing layers to this complicated film. An added note must be made about the performances of J. Smith Cameron, as Lisa's mother, and Jeannie Berlin, as an elder friend who becomes Lisa's uneasy confidante. These essentially unknown actresses give searing portrayals in difficult, unwieldy roles. Lonergan's film shocked me, not just because of its emotional truth, but because of its tenacious refusal to follow any kind of convention common in films today. \\"Margaret\\" is one of the great films of the 21st century.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|As usual a real page turner. This was my 13th Jack Reacher book. Starting the 14th tonight. I love a series.
0345803485|5.0|What are the other books like?  I just started this book and I can't put it down.  Makes you wonder about the author.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|I actually brought this as a gift, so I did not open it.  But I am sure it is an excellent performance as the performers are all first-rate. I also liked the fact that the parcel was delivered exactly as promised on Dec. 24th.
B009CPGHDI|4.0|I really enjoyed this look into Katy Perry's life.  So many touching moments and definitely worth the money to rent it on my Kindle Fire.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Floored by the amazing quality of the film. Felt like it was even better than seeing it on the screen in the mid-seventies
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great puzzle game. Like 'Where's My Water' for adults ;)  My husband has this on his Yoga laptop and I have it on my RAZR Maxx. Runs great on both...no issues.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|One can never go wrong with some James Taylor! His spin on some of the old classics thrown in with some newer alternatives kept Christmas music fresh and interesting this year.
630529142X|5.0|Funny movie. We have watched this movie many times and laugh everytime!  If you like Adam Sandler you will love this movie. Kathy Bates plays his mama. Laugh out loud movie.
1426308469|5.0|The presentation of the material was engaging, presented in a way that children enjoyed and relayed information in way that captured their attention.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|At first when I ran out of coins I'm like am I going to have to pay money for more coins nooo when I woke up I have 45 coins again while your not playing it regens coins  this game is awesome!! :-)
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game.  It's addictive and sometimes frustrating but very hard to put down.  Please expand it to additional levels.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This is a novel to read in one or two or three sittings - plenty of tissues needed. It is thoroughly engrossing.<br /><br />This sounds like 'chicklit'. but the characters develop and change, and are changed by what happens. The writing is intelligent, and sometimes inspired. So really it is anyone's lit.<br /><br />I am so glad I read this book!
B009S33I68|5.0|Having seen the movie with Mel Gibson when I saw this book I had to read the &#34;real&#34; story of that first battle betweeen American and the North Vietnamese Army. The movie only covers the &#34;heroic&#34; conflict at LZ X-Ray and in in true Hollywood style omits the &#34;real&#34;, little known, ambush of the column going to LZ Albany and the unnecessary slaughter of hundreds of US troops.<br /><br />This book is simply but brilliantly written and goes into extensive details which are quite profound and a sad reflection of the political arrogance of the powers that be at the time ( viz President Johnson and his staff ) and the folly of the military system.* The reports from the troops who survived the engagement are profound and are testimony not only of the brutality of the combat in November 1965 but to that which was to follow over the next ten years.<br /><br />The later interviews with the North Vietnamese offices involved makes fascinating reading of what their strategy was at the time. Hal Moore (and McNamara ?) from these first engagements realised that despite the NVA body count ( 12 NVA for each American ) there was no way that the American voting public was going to stand the stream of body bags and mutilated troops who would flood America in the years to come.<br /><br />In summary, an essential read for anyone who has more than a passing interest in the Vietnamese conflict in the 60's and 70's as it covers so many aspects of the battle; the battle itself, the men who lived and died, Lt Col Hal Moore himself, and the aftermath of the two encounters ( the battle ) with the NVA.<br /><br />* A companion to this  is &#34;Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, Mc Namara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff&#34; by H R Mc Master which delves in detail into the political background of the entrance of Amercia into the war. Not an easy read and so full of facts and details that one has to grind through it. But important reading I think to have insight of the politics and the thinking of LBJ.thinking of LBJ.
B00AXVZUCY|3.0|This could have been perfection if  resolved in one season. So 2nd season somewhat disappointing as it naturally begins to strain believability.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is a real life saver. I use it every day. Never fails. Super reliable. Nothing better. I highly suggest you get it.
0553801503|5.0|Our family are voracious readers and George RR Martin has all of us chomping at the bit for each new one.  Crazy, crazy over this series..Read it, Go inside of it.  MOST ENCHANTING
B000002TYX|5.0|Return to the Beatles . I say this only because it means it is not an alblum but  out takes in the studio . It show you haw talented John Lennon and Paul McCartney were as wing songs and if you like to revisit  history of Rock and Roll when the Beatles were<br />at  thier top . You have to buy all three to see how they grew up as young lads from the night clubs in Germany to American soil . Its fun to listen to john as he fiddle with the notes to  a song. I am note a good writer but I know quality when I see it. I grew up with the Beatles, my self and my cousin got an album every year for the holidays. I  do not know what happen to them ,But I used to to know by memory each alblum including the famous White the album I suggest the second one each is a two CD with a story booklet<br />If you a Beatles fan trust  me you will like these Therese addition to your collections<br />Bob Geco
0553106635|5.0|Want this entire series on hardbook..  Love this fantasy  All the readers of our house gobble up the new words from George<br />RR Martin.  A Wonderful world..
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent and disturbing. Once you start reading it, you can't put it down. A story that could happen anywhere. I will read more William Landay novels.
0553801473|5.0|Martin is now so busy with his HBO series, everyone I know that is reading this series are praying he has enough in him to finish it properly.  Incredible that there are so many people hanging on next word.<br />George RR Martin has a fabulous imagination.  His characters are in all of our lives.They may be smaller here in real life, yet there is absolutely nothing small in this books.  all very rich...All very worrisome,The Games are on!  We are hooked on this series, please finish it George :-)
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book was particularly interesting from the technical standpoint.  Most of the engineering and science were quite convincing and indicated that the author has a high knowledge level and/or does thorough research.  Writing in the first person can be challenging, but Mr. Weir did it very well.  The writing held my attention, for the most part, until the book was finished.  If you like science fiction this is a good read.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|The advantage of viewing this movie at home is I can holler and drool without disturbing anyone. Also the combo pack allowed me to watch with girlfriends on the Blu-ray in the living room then have my own private screeing on the little dvd player in the bedroom. I was never a Matthew McConaughey until I saw his solo performance.
B001BANK32|5.0|This is one instance where the movie is just as good as the book. The story is just as compelling and intricate as the movie, with just a different take on the ending.
B005FISBTO|5.0|He loves the Dexter series, so I am sure he will enjoy the sixth season.  I intend to borrow when he is done.
B009EELBIS|5.0|This is one of our family favorites  The HD quality to terrific!!!  We'll enjoy this one over and over again.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Have had no problems with this app.  Nice interface took a bit of getting used to but good, and quick to tune the stations.  Works well on 4g.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|An invigorating twist on events which horrified the world of my youth (I was 9...).  A nice, continuous flow of imagery, graciously human characters, and a refreshing lack of conspiracy theorists mucking up the real story.  True King, actual historical facts, no condescending.  Great...
B008RTJQDI|5.0|Saw these girls for the first time on \\"The Cool TV\\" channel playing the \\"Wolf\\" video. I got the artists name and album title, right away ordered the CD but come to find out it didn't have the song I heard.  Then I bought this boxed set to get \\"Wolf\\". I am disappointed the \\"Wolf\\" video I saw that night, which first turned me on to First Aid Kit, is not on the DVD that comes with this boxed set. YouTube just doesn't cut it.  Maybe a 3rd version release?
0425252868|5.0|I am an avid reader and a bit of a history buff. I followed Mr. Makos in his younger years when he had a magazine with classmates from high school. And a fine magazine it was. It was like he was scrambling to get the information, the history on paper before the ones that lived it were gone. Out of the blue I had seen HIGHER CALL advertised and I ordered it immediately. I had to take the book with me to a doctor's visit. I really could not put it down. I learned things about WWII. I learned things about the German military as well as our own. And I learned that Germany had their heroes. And as it turned out some of their heroes were ours. Neither side wanted to be there, but were honor bound to be there, and fight. Sadly in many cases die for their flag. Were they all honorable men? No. No more than everyone that goes to church is faithful. And this book only underlined for me the importance of having a strong, well trained military. And when I see a man or women in uniform I will take the time to stop them and say Thank You. What these people and their families go through everyday to keep us free cannot be put into words. I gave this book five stars only because I can't give it more.
B0011NVCSO|2.0|The record skipped and I was not happy with my purchase. I couldn't see any damage but when I gave it as a gift and we put it in the record player it did not play smoothly. I was disappointed and embarrassed.
B004U8VWIM|2.0|Just a dull movie. The only reason I watched the whole thing is because my wife wanted to.  Next time I'm just going to bed
B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly nails it again. Harry Bosch just keeps getting better.  The new &#34;unsolved&#34; crime unit is a refreshing read.  I had no idea where this novel was going with the book beginning with the LA riots of yesteryear.
0007466064|4.0|I have read all the books in series and they are all very good and keep ypur interest, would recommend them
B0015DROBO|5.0|Excellent story, gripping keeps you reading to find out what will happen. Wish the author had written more novels before his death.
B001LM1456|5.0|I liked the movie: action and romance. I think that it did well, incorporating previous concepts from the original T.V. version, movies, and the comics. I liked the story line; the fact that it was not a re-make, and appreciated the cameos of previous &#34;hulk&#34; actors. Those brought back memories.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|If you want to be entrapped in a world of literary mystery then this is the book fir you. It will completely throw you for a loop!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My son loves this movie, and I bought it for $3.99 as a Christmas gift for him. Great deal! Cute movie and keeps my 5-year-old entertained.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I watched season 1 and was permanently hooked.  Season 2 was even better.  Can hardly wait for season three now
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book represents my childhood. Anyone who grew up in the eighties will get nostalgic, even though the story is set in the year 2040. Ernest Cline has amazingly crafted a science fiction book that is so rooted in history that it may well represent a very tangible future. The characters are fresh. Ideas concerning identity are challenged. Gaming is a way of life. I don't want to give away too much plot, but I would seriously recommend this book. One reviewer compared it to Willy Wonka meets The Matrix. What more can I say? Read it!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Tried to watch it on tv but missed the beginning.  Now my husband and I are hooked.  We love it
B007VUA7VO|5.0|well implemented on my asus tablet 101 would recomend to any tablet user.<br />great look and interface. need more like this app keep up your good work
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Didn't use as much as I thought.  And would like reference books to be included with device  as I can't get it to delete
B00A80SHFM|4.0|The only reason I did not rate this five stars was because it didn't include one of my favorite songs, Do You Hear the People Sing. The only reason.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Can anyone say leave me alone??<br />Great game!!! Having too much fun .can't wait to unlock all games.<br />Hope to find more games by them.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|This book really should be more popular. I love fantasy books, but usually they  turn out cliché and silly. This book is neither. The fantasy elements are believable, the characters endearing, and nothing is swept up in stupid love triangles or senseless angst. I was entranced within the first chapter and felt incredibly invested in the main character's life, through every mistake and success. I look forward to reading the next one.  Well done Mr. Rothfuss.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|i love this game<br /> jgcjgxhtcvcgbbvc  h  h h ghh  g  h hgch  hgh  h  hg  hgh  h  h  h  h  free  h h h  hgchgcytcyfc  hfchfchfchfchfch
B007HACDLK|5.0|His latest book is not dissappointing and will keep you enthralled from the first chapter.  I could not put this one down.
B0086700CM|2.0|Runners can't tilts to avoid gaps or collect coins. My daughter is very upset. It's one of her favorite games. Normally, it's a great game.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|This show is great for the family.  I get one for our house and one for my daughter and granddaughter.  Season 4 was great.  Colin Morgan (Merlin) is a fantastic actor, moves us to tears often, and has great comedic timing.  And Bradley James (Arthur) has grown his character over these years so that we adore Arthur like his knights do.  The production values (costumes, sets, music, etc.) are first rate, too.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This app is very,very useful. Sometimes it closes automatically, but works very well. Also the fact that I can awake up to my own music and not be startled like a regular bedside alarm. Love it.
B005FNJL7K|1.0|This was a total waste of time and money.  Here was an opportunity to make a masterpiece of enjoyable listening, and it is full of the atonal, aggressive music, and seems like little of the beautiful themes.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|This was one of Brad Pitt's better movies with classic Tarantino style.  It does have some fairly graphic scenes, but again, classic Tarantino.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|I've watched this several times and thought it was about time I bought it for real.  Looking forward to watching it many more.
0062127241|4.0|This is about Pete's personal life & struggles of fame, drugs, alcohol, infidelity, spiritual, his struggle w/ sexuality to psychotherapy. He was going to write his biography when he turned 21. I tell you after reading this it makes it uneasy listening to \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\".<br />Pete is one of the most intellectual musicians around and very talented performer. He created many techniques and equipment used by other bands on stage and in the studios.<br /><br />Townshend doesn't go into detail on each Who album. On some he skims over. Even his solo recordings are not in detail but gives you a brief glimpse.<br /><br />Pete's time w/ The Who seems to be an outsider looking in. The only time they are in sync is on stage. Once off the stage Pete notes he's usually working on his own as John & Keith hang out together. As for Roger & himself they don't have much in common.<br /><br />Pete talks about the internet scandal that he had to explain and of course the on going rock opera LifeHouse. Some stories I wished he spend more time on but seemed to be cut short.<br />Townshend actually started this memior in '97 and I'm sure he must of wrote over 5,000 pages that had to be whittled down to 507 pages. I didn't count the 7 pages of acknowledgements.<br /><br />This story goes all the way to the latest Who \\"Endless Wire\\" release & tour. Pete talks about his appreciation of Roger's talents an friendship which is much stronger now. Near the end of this book Pete is talking about a new rock opera called \\"Floss\\".<br /><br />Would I recommend it? It depends how much you enjoy Pete Townshend.<br />He does come off as a really caring person. Even states he suffers from \\"White Knight Syndrome\\". Maybe in hindsight he has a chance to gather his thoughts.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|If you are a fan of the show, then you will love it!  While watching one of the shows we laughed until we cried.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Have been watching this movie for years. Now I watch it with my kids. They love it too.  Spielberg captures the excitement of being a kid on an adventure of discovery with plenty of kid type fears and fun.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Because it was very interesting and  I like to read books a lot especially this amazing book I'm looking forward to be reading the next book
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love these guys! Such good music. Up to date music. I would really love to have a Christmas CD from them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely an amazing book! I find it hard usually to get interested in a book but this one caught my attention from the very beginning! Ready to read the next book of the series!
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|All of the features I tired on IP Camera Full worked as expected or better. I started with the free version, but did not like the ads and some of the features were disabled.  Since it worked quite well I upgraded to full.  I am using the Viewer on a 7&#34; Kindle HD with an X10 Airsight camera.  IP Cam Viewer only runs when it is being used on the Kindle, unlike many other apps which actually run in the background when not in use. While the camera works somewhat on the Kindle browser, IP Cam Viewer works much better.<br /><br />As an experiment, I tried using the Viewer with Blue Stacks (Android simulator for PC) and it works great there also, looks better than the X10 supplied PC software and runs smoother.  But Blue Stacks takes a while to come up itself if you do not let it run all the time and at times adversely affects PC performance while collecting all kinds of information, so I went back to the X10 supplied PC software and continue to use IP Cam Viewer on the Kindle where comes up immediately.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was great. Every moment had me on the edge of my seat. My heart almost stopped when Percy jumped in the river Styx.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|we have followed Percy's adventures from the first book and the children and I love them. Now we are waiting (impatiently) on the 4th installment ....
B0012NVGHU|5.0|We enjoyed this movie greatly. It is a great story, low key, but with huge aspirations. The music is great, as you would expect from The Swell Season.
B00280LYIC|4.0|An unusual way to blend past and present! A great series which will help children to pass their tests on Greek mythology!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Cute movie with very good singing.  Not quite as good as Glee but if you like Glee you will like this.
B000FC1MCS|3.0|I found the book very well written - and felt it very realistic in many respects. He is a very gifted writer. However, I found the blatant swearing and blasphemies unnecessary and they (for me) detracted from the story and I would find it hard to recommend it to others for that reason.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The Indiana Jones movies have always been my favorites, so I really appreciate this terrific box set of all 4 movies.  The packaging could have been better, but it's the movies that really count.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I believe this is the best book I've ever read, never wanted to put it down. Can't wait to read more by this author!
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|It was unwatchable as the amazon service continuously paused to load the video data. I am on a trial premium membership for a month and have been extremely disappointed with the quality of the transmission. If it does not improve I will not continue my membership. I should not be billed for this movie as I was forced to watch cable TV instead.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Something to pass the time with.  Been doing these puzzles for years - free but pass the time away while waiting for someone.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Choose to read the book before going to see the movie, will be interesting to see how it is translated to film.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The best love story yet! If you want to read a great love story then SAFE HAVEN is the book for you!!! My favorite :)
B005KR6OBM|5.0|The dvd's I got were used but in excellent shape.<br />Packaging and securing of the dvd's inside box were done well.<br />Sheldon would approve.
B007SUW24W|5.0|I love it soo much, its the best album I've ever heard! I wish there were more albums like this!
B000001F9N|5.0|A great voice and performer for all time.  This follow up album showcases the diva's haunting voice full of desire and longing.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Draw Something is the game that I play all the time! Its super fun and addicting! Really good for Free!
0784010501|5.0|This the concert reel that gave an eyes wide open peek behind the crazy world that was the material girl's 1990 world concert.  So what keeps us coming back?  Was it the great concert footage....the controversial performances drawing disapproval from the Vatican or Canadian authorities..or those endless backstage and off stage moments of the material girl playing bored diva, stage mom to her errant back-up performers and handlers and not to be missed cameo moments with stars from film and stage?  Who cares!  This concert doc tour de force was a blast and may not be repeated or surpassed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book makes you keep reading, it will never let you down! Such a good page turner! I loved this book!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is one of those movies that's worth seeing again and again!  From the awesomely moody soundtrack featuring a Tears for Fear favorite of mine Head Over Heels.  This was my first intro to a young and talented Jake Gyllenhaal supported by a cast of familiar names and faces playing strange characters that leave you scratching your head.  This was a movie that was &#34;out there&#34; for its time.  It all comes together in the end as Jake as Donnie Darko takes us on his sleepwalking journey through the moody mystery this movie is.
B006ON41FC|2.0|This is self explanatory.  no way to change orientation in settings.  great game on my phone but unplayable on fire hd due to this issue.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|If you have ever heard her stratospheric career launching album &#34;Love to Love You Baby&#34; or were old enough to have bought or heard the album's title track you would recognize that as the birth of this disco diva!  The world lost a treasure with her untimely death in 2012.  This album takes me back to the beginning and the to the dance floors where she was worshipped.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was the best of everything. Funny, witty, sad. I loved it! I couldn't put it down till the end!
0140177396|5.0|It was an awesome book that never got me bored!! It is full of action and excitement!! Would definitely recommend this book!!
0143119680|3.0|I usually don't read bestsellers or books that are deemed  popular with some exceptions.This book is not unpleasant reading  but a lot of it is very slick and somewhat formulaic( (what I try to avoid in mainstream books) but that said it is readable.When I was a teenager there were always books for young girls that outlined little daily actions\\"I went to the sink and washed my favorite green mohair sweater\\"or I ate two pieces of toast with  raspberry tea and held the cup in my right hand.There is lots of this in \\"Discovery of Witches\\".This constant need to describe daily activities that really have no bearing on the story is annoying .It adds a personal touch but does little else we are not talking heavy symbolism hidden in a teaspoon here. I guess the author is trying for intimacy but it goes awry the  imagery need to be stronger to make those kinds of details work in creating ambience. The descriptions are fairly typical and stereotyped.It also reminded me of the TV show \\"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\\" which featured a witch raised my two aunts and a bewitched talking cat.I half expect a bewitched talking cat to appear in the library and start talking to the daemons, wizards etc..Not being a vampire fan this whole genre leaves me kind of cold - maybe that is one reason I am not more enamored .However I do like libraries and I recently saw the Bodleian collection so that made the book intriguing. I havent finished it but it is just not very scintillating despite being a fast reader - I  am laboring through this one.I do like the premise that all these vampires, daemons and wizards are walking around seems like they almost outnumber the humans and that has a germ of a story in it. I dont think I could ever make it through the trilogy. Though I enjoy  the mystical and magical connotations -  I prefer it in an Alice Hoffman novel  or a well crafted ghost story.
0792838912|4.0|I like the movie; however, the level of sound seems to go from quiet to very loud throughout the movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really like this app, its easy to use and it works beautifully. I like the fact that that I can upload my own mobi files and it treats them just like a downloaded book. I also have a kindle Fire HD, and it doesn't let me do that, or at least I haven't been able to make it work. This app on my smart phone displays the cover page and remembers the page, on the kindle my mobi files are not treated like books and it just displays a generic cover page, they are not even under &#34;Books.&#34;
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|After the amazing reviews I was excited to read this... SO boring.  I finally gave up 1/2 way through after muddling along hoping it would get better.  What really bothered me was that there was no indication in the book description that this was going to be about teenagers in high school.  (and written for them apparently, with the writing style, word choice etc - but, yet not recommended for under 17?)  I'm glad it was only $4.  i don't feel as ripped off.
B007FY9ZWI|4.0|The free Rocket Music Player, used in conjunction with iSyncr to sync my iTunes playlists to my Kindle, have enabled me to give up my ancient iPod and use my KFHD8.9 for the several hours of podcast listening I do each week through one of my stereo systems. Rocket Player is missing some convenience features, like an indicator showing you've played a podcast and how many times. I submitted some questions and suggestions to the company and quickly had a helpful e-mail exchange with them. I'm looking forward to seeing my requests implemented. I did not see that the paid version of Rocket Music Player added any features important to me.<br /><br />Added 1/15/2013: This morning I launched Rocket Player and after a few seconds it displayed a message saying it had stopped working. No reason or further analysis was given. I tried several more times, same problem. I tried rebooting my KFHD, same problem occurred. So I removed Rocket Player from my device and downloaded it again from my cloud. After that, all was well. What caused this problem? I have no idea. It's the first time I've had an app behave like this, but I don't know that Rocket Player itself caused the problem or whether something else caused a problem that affected Rocket Player. The nice thing is that simply removing it and downloading again from the cloud fixed the problem.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|By far one of the best books I've read in a while!  Great story and very likeable characters.  Very emotionally connected
B000I8G5B2|5.0|I bought this movie via instant stream because I had seen it before but enver own a copy. This movie is great for stimulating discussions about scientific dystopias, and the fallacies of cultural ideals in practice.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|...how can you go wrong? Great stories by a great author made into entertaining movies the whole family can watch.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is the first time reading and WOW...AMAZING. I will definitely be reading the entire series and watching the movies.
B00009RDGA|5.0|Great film but tatum was not a sup actress in this one she was the lead so how does she merit a sup actress award? If she would hve received a best actress nom she would have not won that oscar. It would have been either sylvia sidney or linda blair. Ryan should have received a nomination. Madaline kahn was the sup actress in this pic. Oscar ya got it wrong still a timeless classic
B009KKLQKO|5.0|Listened to it the day I got it with my seround sound & found it amazing, totally awsome!! Great video.
B00422LESO|1.0|I depend a fair amount on reviews to guide my purchase choices, whether it be a book or a toaster.  The reviews let me down on this one.  I found this book tedious and boring, and Jane to be an annoying whiner.  There were some moments of humor, but I couldn't wait to finish and skimmed through a lot of it.  Luckily I got it for $1.99 as a Daily Deal.  Even that was too much.
B00AE2I4B6|2.0|It was entertaining but nothing else. Same as the previous 3 parts, hot dancers, predictable ending, this time in South Miami Beach.
B005LAII12|1.0|My husband ordered this movie and I lost focus in it after about 15 minutes, which is saying something since I normally like more 'manly' movies than my husband. But this is just pure raunchiness and crude jokes/language every five seconds and we didn't even watch the unrated edition.
0765325950|5.0|The book was as great as expected. Most critics draw from the length of release dates for the books. I am not of fan of waiting, but I will not base a conclusion on how well a story was told because of the frustration in waiting as most 1 star's will whether they admit it or not. The book ended the series with a fitting conclusion fitting Tale of two cities.
B00005ASOC|4.0|This is a brilliant movie, I watch it about once a year. The casting is wonderful and just be sure to grab some tissues before watching.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a joy ... I LOVE IT!  We turn it on every night with the timer set to 1 hour. Today I clicked on favorites ..and am thrilled with the combinations I would not have thought before to have tried.
0694003611|1.0|I have tried to read this a dozen times to our toddler and he just has no interest. And to be fair he will bring several books over to me and have me read them to him but this one he won't even go near. I think there is just too much going on in the pictures and too many words for him to focus on.
B005VPRET4|5.0|My 7 yo daughter just got this set for Christmas. I wasn't a fan of 'girl' Lego, but figured we would give it a try b/c she hasn't wanted to play w many toys lately. It was a hit. She easily put it together and applied the stickers. She likes all the small utensils and accessories, although you have to be careful not to lose them and keep them away from younger siblings.
B003UYV08E|4.0|I fell in love with the Marvel series right after Iron Man came out and although this one isn't bad I still like the first one better. The graphics are brilliant though and you gotta love RDJ ;)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Kept me coming back for more!Can't wait for the next one!The last chapter was unexpected.Hope the next book stands up this one.
B009NH6AOQ|3.0|I have not yet recieved this set as they have not all been released yet, but sure looking forward to it!
030759565X|5.0|Everything I anticipated and more. Deb Perelman is a born story-teller. She puts you in charge of your kitchen by showing/telling how to pull off culinary magic. Everything I have tried so far has been spectacular, with the exception of the popcorn cookies. That was my fault. The popcorn I used wasn't great quality and it showed in the finished product.<br /><br />Nice photos, great explanations, fun anecdotes.<br /><br />This book is going to stay in my best-loved cookbook rack for a long time!
B005LAJ22Q|3.0|This is one of the best series I have ever gotten so involved in. My only complaint is that 3 of 4 discs came with scratches and I purchased new products.
B00961ZGQC|4.0|I like the song and had free mp3 downloads so I used them to get this song so I could here it not on the radio.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|I am so glad to have been able to order this series. Now I can watch anytime at all. However there was a scratch on one of the discs and that is the only reason I did not give this item 5 stars.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I've read a lot of romance novels but this is just lovely .... everything about makes u want to be living it .. Conner and Megan .. just wow!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Enjoyed start to end, couldn't put it down. You will be hooked in no time.  Well worth the time.  Enjoy!
B004SBQGHS|3.0|This game was not much fun to play on the Kindle because it freezes up all the time. I stopped playing it.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I think this is the best album they have made so far, but many of their earlier fans may disagree with me. This is due to the harder style that the band has implemented in to this album and also in the A Star Crossed Wasteland album (my second favorite album of theirs). I enjoy their music from their earlier albums as well just not enough to buy the albums. Their music is great for working out, it helps me stay focused and energized. I would love to see more albums like this one in the future, lots of great songs.
0060935464|5.0|I love this book! I had read it years ago and this time purchased it for a book club. We spent a year reading classics and this was my choice. I enjoyed it just as much the second time around, really amazing story of prejudice and doing what's right.
B0094LY88G|5.0|Moneyball was a good movie,insightful, Brad Pitt i thought was very good as well as all the other characters.Amazon on demand did not work correctly with my roku. Will not go yhat route again.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game. I used to play it all the time but lately haven't played at all. However, it's one of the more fun games available on the Kindle.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great story with a different perspective.  Very well written!  Research was great and the understanding of predicament many were in during the war is superb.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I didn't even play this game because the regular Angry Birds app always freezes on my Kindle. I deleted it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I was 17. This book became, for me, the best novel ever written.  It is still still my favorite. Within its pages, I find the beauty of love, growth of the human heart and spirit, and the belief that one can change and become better than they were. This novel touches my heart every time I read it. Truly, to love another person is to see the face of God.
B003YL4KS0|4.0|I really loved reading the tips in this book. While all did not work for me, as a &#34;curly girl&#34; it's always nice to have tips and tricks to keep my curly hair looking nice and not frizzy!
0525958002|5.0|Read this book in two days.  You have to really be a fan and have been around in those big days, though.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I couldn't get this app to work so it was useless to me. I was hoping for something similar to the Weather Bug app I have on my phone.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It was good but nothing compares to the Dark Knight. I can't believe people think this movie is comparable. Don't recommend.
B0058VW36U|3.0|I downloaded this game for my son. Tried to play it but never got very far. It's not really for me, but my kids like it.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Just like Family Guy, crass and stupid humor that only is good for a bunch of uneducated small town dummies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game to pass the time while waiting somewhere or winding down for the day. Becomes addicting! Good graphics - easy to play.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Give the show a shot. If you like Zombies you will be an instant fan. If you don't there are a lot of other sub plots that makes this show a must see. It's not like those hokey Zombie films, it's more like the original &#34;Night of the Living Dead.&#34; It realistically tackles the issue of what the world would be like if it was over run by Zombies and touches on themes of abortion and gun rights issues. It really is amazing.
B005HSL626|3.0|I downloaded this app for my kids, who like the game. I only played it once or twice - it's not really for me, but my kids like it!
B000J159N8|5.0|Title says it all.  I really enjoyed the various aspects of this story about the start of Vietnam.  Worth watching!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I am not sure what I was expecting but I had heard a lot of hype about this movie but was unimpressed.  It was ok, but glad I didn't pay to see it in the big theatre.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found this novel absolutely riveting with great character development.  I was disappointed by the ending and felt that the author just \\"gave up\\" on his story.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I enjoy reading this type of book and find most of them believeable.  I do believe this is real, but there was more medical information in there than I would have wanted to read.  Although I do understand why he put it in there to prove his medical condition of the brain.  I still wanted to hear more about the other side.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is interesting and leaves you on a lot of cliff hangers.I think a lot of people would like this book.
B009PEPML4|5.0|but if you love finding beauty in dark places this album is beautiful! Needless to say I do very much
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Keeps your heart aching for more the whole way through. You find yourself rooting for one side and then doubt it by the next page.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Lousy acting wasn't has dark as had hopped. just like all the other popular teen crap think Twilight and all that other boring stuff
B00899F0G8|5.0|This is the most addicting show!  I can't watch it on tv though because I have no patience for commercials.
B007MJSYF0|2.0|There is literally no content/ plot or anything that makes this movie worth watching save for some really lousy graphics in deaths. So I guess the Hunger Games really did copy this movie verbatim.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The acting and old world scenes are just great. Cannot wait for for Season 3.<br /><br />GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD
0307591549|5.0|Mr. Achor's book is packed with solid, fun studies that provide practical advice to becoming a happier and more productive person.  His dry wit and quick pacing keep any reader engaged.  Worth every penny.  Watch his lecture on TED and then use this book for notes.
1449410243|5.0|We gave this book to two different family members for Christmas. Both have evil cats, so we are hoping that besides being funny and entertaining, it may also save their lives. LOL!
B00628RVV0|5.0|Great movie!  A must see!  The main character's courage and integrity is inspiring.  This is a movie I would want to own.
1452110581|5.0|We gave this to my sister-in-law for Christmas - she loved it! And to add to the hilariaty she read poems to us each time before she opened a gift...we laughed a lot!!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie is very very very very very ... very funny. If you like adult humor, you will love this movie.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|Love this book. I have compatible views anyway that existed prior to this novel. I don't think this is extreme or frightening.  It makes sense that there must be something wonderful beyond the small and somewhat pointless way people live their lives, and the pain suffering and misery that others experience.  Or the goal oriented to money and material goods.  Happiness being the fuzzy idea that we can achieve somewhere out there waiting for us.  I feel in my deepest heart there is a wonderful pulsating place of love and wondrous awe waiting for us on the other side of death. This book just confirmed what I believe in my heart.
B0028AQLYE|5.0|This snorkel dry top works as advertised. It is great for flip turns because you don't have to push a large amount of water out of your snorkel before taking that first breath. Be advised, this will limit your flow of oxygen significantly. So, if you are not a strong swimmer, work up some cardio before purchasing this item.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i absolutely love this game but I need more friends. my user name is araincloud. thanks in advance fellow bronies!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have such a love for Katniss. Just when you think it can't get worse it does. You want to be happy at the end but it is so hard.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game, exciting and adventure all packed into a fun and creepy game. Reminds me of a creepy dream you get trapped
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Very fun game. One of the most immersive games on this app store. Graphics are good and gameplay is better
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Kind of hard to understand in the beginning but after I got the hang of it it was a lot of fun. Enjoyed the challenge.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I recommend it a lot it's am amazing ix pf Greek and roman gods and demigods and it' very entertaining
1559211407|5.0|This little book tells a big story of possibilities. A shared interest in rare books connects two people slowly, over time, but solidly to open their lives, and that of the reader.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful book! Best I've read so far! (: I recommend this book for anyone to read. Definitely not what I expected.
0765325950|5.0|There's not much to say about the ending that hasn't already been said. It was perfect. The series had its slow points (although I personally only was bored during Crossroads of Twilight and loved the rest) but they added to the grandeur. This series epitomizes fantasy.<br /><br />Now about the (current) three star overall rating. Many people are giving the book one star solely because Harriet (the late author's wife) decided to delay the release of the ebook. I'm sure if you're far enough in the series to be contemplating buying this book you will buy it regardless of the rating. For those newcomers, do not be fooled! Sanderson has done a spectacular job breathing new life into the series and bringing it to a satisfying conclusion. If other (long running) fantasy series end half as good I'd be thankful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Keeps you hanging on to every last word! Could not put it down, a must read,you will not be disappointed!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Seems like a pretty fun game. I like the graphics. Seems like it will give me something to do for tons of hours to come.
B0026772N8|4.0|I read this when I was in college and thought at the time that it was one of the wisest, most important books ever. It's not, of course, but it's still a very entertaining and pretty smartly-written narrative about figuring out one's life. I wonder if young people today would find it as influential, but I think the current generation of seekers should check it out.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This film was well- acted, poignant, and even though harsh at times, you leave with a sense of hope. Very clever plot.
B008M36EEI|5.0|I did not expect that I would like this picture and watched it because someone else wanted to see it. I was very surprised and thought it was a great movie. Ewan McGregor was oustanding.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Really good read,! I couldn't put the book down. This book was a good way to start the new year.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|My favorite movies of all time.  The bonus material is worth the watch as well.  The HD quality is also superb.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|It was a little over the top. From a NY cop to #1 tough guy in the battle against the enemy
B007IXWL2C|1.0|this is to S&M erotica what Twilight is to vampires.  don't waste your time.  for great S&M erotica go get the A. N. Roquelaure Sleeping Beauty trilogy.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I was disappointed in Grisham. I thought he wrote a better book? The book started out very interesting and then he faded. Just things that were done were shall we say almost impossible
B008FSCNTK|2.0|I'M A DIANA KRALL FAN, BUT I THINK HER GREAT LOOKS AND BODY IS MISLEADING. THIS CD IS NOT THAT GOOD I WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|Real stupid, this book is a real fairy tale. I finished it because I started it otherwise, If i had known what this book really contained I would have never purchased it. I don't believe in supermen.
B009H442DG|5.0|A CD WITH A VARIETY OF SINGERS, YOU DON'T SEE THAT MUCH ANYMORE. A GREAT SELECTION TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION.
B00428LIXO|5.0|Bought this for my 4 month old grandson! He can hold it in his hands just for a few seconds at a time.  It plays music and makes musical  sounds when you bang it!!  Happy with this purchase.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome Shows and Season ~ I can't wait for the next season! When is the next season coming back on AMC?
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoy Nicholas Sparks writing. It's a pretty good book so far, haven't gotten through the whole thing yet. Can't wait to see the movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I spend way too much time with this but love it! challenging and easy.  wish there were not so many ads but free means ads
B005MJFA2W|5.0|Incredibly logical but deeply insightful.  This book has made me more away of my own opinions and how they are formed and in turn how I can improve decision making.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is a must see for everyone.  It paint a picture of the real state of this nation beyond the bi-partisan picker and show us what is the causes of the problem in government today.  All this lobbyist and the corporate person hood will continue to ruined the way of life of farmers and consumers in the name of profit.  Watch it and you shall get another point of view other than what was fed to the mass.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicolas Sparks did well.  It was a good book and I couldn't put it down.  Quick easy read if that is what you are looking for.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I had this book sitting on my 'in free time read' area of my kindle, and with this wintertime weather, it was a great way to spend the day!  I LOVED IT!  THe characters are very identifiable and their reactions seem normal (I hate it when you're reading a book and you think &#34;why the heck would they do that?&#34; .... none of that going on here.) SO.... that being said, I loved this book, read it cover to cover in one day!  I highly recommend!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Good family DVD. I have nothing more to say. I can not say more about it. This is sufficient now
B004LROUNG|3.0|John Grisham usually keeps me reading but with this book I could put it down and wait a day or two to pick it up again.  It is good to see that sometimes the lawyers get burned.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I loved this book! It made me feel like a litttle kid again. I grew up with these stories and now i see them in a whole new light. Thank You Chris Colfer!!!!!
B006QLH7O4|2.0|I have to admit, I'm not the biggest Final Destination fan but I have watched the first and the second and I love them both. I heard it started going downhill after and I'm starting to believe it. If people are willing to give this movie a 5 star review then that can only mean the last two must have been extremely awful because this one is the easily and by far the worst Final Destination movie I've seen. Let me rephrase that: this is the only Final Destination movie I've seen that I didn't like. If you've seen the first and the second (or just the first is enough), then you won't be surprised, you won't be engaged, you won't even be interested in knowing what happens next as it's so obvious. Characters are uninteresting and straightforward. Movie does not even attempt to add anything extra to the series and seem to be more like a remake (or spiritual replacement) of the first movie. Put it this way, story and character wise is plain boring (unless this is your first entry into the series).<br /><br />With all that said, reason why I'm giving this a 2 star compared to a 1 star is the first action scene and the 3D effects. Both were pretty well. The first scene won't blow your mind away but it was definitively entertaining to watch. The use of 3D effects really added a lot to the scenes of interest and I think it had one of the best uses of it. Although out of the movie, maybe you get 15-20 minutes of good 3d action.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you watched the first or the second movie and you don't care about 3d, I highly recommend skipping this movie. Not worth your time. If you've never watched a Final Destination movie then this one could be interesting for you. If you only care about 3D, maybe wait till the price drops to $5-10 or something.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|I like this game.  I love building games.  They are one of my favorite types of games to play. I think anyone who likes building games and pirates would enjoy this game.
0765325950|5.0|In a word, frantic.  The pacing of the book, that is, in a good way.  After 10-11 books that were an ever expansion of the plot, book 14 brought it all together at breakneck speed.  The chapter titled, \\"The Last Battle\\" was EPIC.  Awesome idea of having *that chapter* being 190 pages.  We've been waiting for 23 years for the last battle, and its epicness did not disappoint.  Good job Sanderson.  Good job Jordan, RIP.  All the 1-star reviews are just haters, this book should be a 4.6 at least.  On a personal note this was the first book in the entire series that I finished in UNDER 1 week, so I suppose by pace was frantic too :)
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. I don't read much but this one grabbed my attention and I'm glad i read it. I did not want to put it down. I was hoping she would come back somewhere or appear. But this was absolutely amazing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to see with large charactors for old eyes :) and the price is right ... Free Free Free
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Completely hooked on this season- I've found it much scarier than the last. The whole cast is flawless and it's beautifully shot. I'm usually not into anything horror, but this has brought me around. Give it a try!
B008I34YYY|5.0|Simply love this film!! It reminded me of The Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow but 5 times better.<br /><br />  I got to say this too that some of the cast ( all absolutely wonderful and gorgeous ) have other Hollywood look-a-likes - the beautiful Julia Dietze as Renate Ricther = Julie Benz -- Stephanie Paul who plays the U.S. president = mature Amy Acker -- and Gotz Otto as Klaus Adler = Finnish Rally driver Marcus Gronholm.<br /><br />  Very well made story and plot, the costumes quite masterful and the most of CGI designed rocketships I think are very convincingly believable because there is a big possibility some of them can actually be built in the future.<br /><br />  Spoiler alert.. looks like Mars is the next target. I do hope if they make a sequel it would still be the same guys and most of the main casts'..
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome game best game ever never played a game better cool coolest game ever coolest game ive ever played sweet
1416575464|5.0|I bought this as a house warming gift - my friend loved it.  It inspires and offers new ideas to spruce up your home!
B006TTC57C|5.0|Came in really quick and movie was clear and brand new! Was not damaged at all. One ofbthe best cartoon films ever!
0345803485|2.0|After all the hype I had to buy it.  First half of he book was interesting but last several chapters were very similar.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|It's alright. I only play it when there's absolutely nothing to do. This game will kind of kill the boredom.
B00881VLCE|4.0|helps to pass the time while waiting on appointments and other things that take forever now doesn't seem so bad
B0085YNML2|4.0|My niece and I fought over playing this game. She loved it and so do I. The game is cute to attract my 4 years old niece.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The free content kept me going all night. Good puzzles and a versatile hint system. We'll see about buying the full version.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I like the game, though it only took me a few days to beat the game. Now I'm just to the part I got to defeat the dragon which I'm not sure how to. :p
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is great for keeping up with battery usage and more.  I would highly recommend it to others.  Fabulous!!
0979019710|4.0|There was something telling me to check out Hal's work...I saw an ad on Facebook encouraging me to sign up for a tele-class...then he promoted the book he was about to launch...and I ordered it...I didn't research ordering it. I just did it...intuitively knowing that the Miracle Morning would help and 2 weeks into living the Miracle Morning, I can honestly say this book works if you work the book...within 2 weeks...I have changed, my business rocks and I am just starting to date 2 women...in 2 weeks! Imagine what a life time of these mornings can bring? I suggest you don't pass go, or collect $200, that you go directly to the link to buy this book!!!
B00632HWOG|5.0|this is something I use everyday, whether at work or home or on my cell phone. It is a must have in my world.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's a solitary game.  Not a lot to say about it.  Simple to play yet makes you think about where to move the cards.  Another game to play during the commericals.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|Jackson has created an alternate-Hobbit, which yet remains enough like the book to engage fans.<br /><br />The movie does pretty much tell the story of the book. Yet it also adds or emphasizes things the book does not. Much of the stuff the movie adds beyond the books is there to tie the Hobbit into the overall story of the Lord of the Rings movies, to foreshadow what is to come. I liked this.<br /><br />Like probably all Tolkien fans, I have some quibbles with this movie. The dwarves' song by Bilbo's fire about the dragon's gold near the beginning was too short - it was a great scene, and it's important in the book, but it's too brief in the movie. Also, the dwarves weren't quite dwarf enough. Also, as usual these days in Hollywood, the action and violence was excessive. I would have preferred a story closer to the book's original children's fantasy.<br /><br />The character of Bilbo is also made a little more heroic, a little less timid than the book. I'm not sure if I like this, but it works in the movie.<br /><br />One quibble I do NOT have is the length of the movie. I didn't feel like the movie was too long. However, when I watch it again I will be fast-forwarding past the fighting scenes, which I find tedious and superficial in most movies. The beginning also did drag a little. But as a Tolkien fan I don't begrudge spending those extra minutes in the marvelous world of Middle Earth.<br /><br />Of course, this movie is just the first third of the story. I look forward to the remaining two sequels. Of course I hope they are as good as this first one. Based on Jackson's track record with four Tolkien movies so far, I'm optimistic.<br /><br />It's obvious to me now after seeing this first Hobbit movie that Jackson is taking Tolkien's Hobbit, a children's story, and re-imagining it as a full-blown epic in its own right, to stand alongside his Lord of the Rings trilogy. After thinking about it, I like this. If I want the original Hobbit I can (and will) read the book again.<br /><br />The thing I like about Jackson's Tolkien movies is that they portray characters and settings exactly as I pictured them from the books, yet the movies are different enough that they don't spoil my future re-reading of the books. I can enjoy both the books and the movies as parallel but not equivalent experiences.<br /><br />On the whole, this movie was a marvelously successful effort that fans should not miss.<br /><br />Note: This review is based on a theater viewing, since the DVD is currently not out yet. I intentionally saw the \\"regular\\" version - not 3D, not High Frame Rate. I was pretty sure I would enjoy the regular version best.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I liked they way it was written, It kept me interested to the very end...I was still guessing when it did end.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Greatly enjoying this series. Even my wife who isn't into fantasy movies is really enjoying the series.....but alas &#34;Winter is coming&#34; and we will have to wait for Season 2 to become available.

B0091574VI|5.0|What a great film. The younger viewers (kids) will really enjoy the antics and parents can use some of the lessons on caring and group dynamics. Be warned that there are some scenes that portray the darker aspects of life....but they are not presented in graphic detail like most modern documentaries. Just a great family movie.

B008578PRK|4.0|This movie was much better than we expected, but was a bit chilling for pre-Christmas viewing.  Daniel Radcliffe has definitely grown-up.
0765325950|5.0|I haven't read the book but felt compelled to give it 5 stars due to all the whining about the ebook release.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|A wonderful story with romance and humor. Love the actors and one of the best parts I have seen Jack Black perform. How could you not love these guys? There were a couple of chances we get to laugh at ourselves.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the book.  Easy reading, eye opening real life occurrences brought to light by this author.  I highly recommend.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|because it is a demo you only get 5 minutes of playing time and every time you go close to a animal it attacks
0425263908|1.0|I can't believe how much this book copied from \\"Shades of Grey\\"! Clumsy woman falls around a handsome man. Man is super rich. Come on Sylvia! Get your own story line!
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and myself to watch and have enjoyed it very much. Love Jane Eyre and love Micheal Fassenburger in it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The Life of Pi is a beautifully written story that keeps you engaged from page 1 right through to the final page.
1419705849|5.0|my daughter loves this series and is collecting all of them.  She read in just 2 days! Fun book for young readers
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Reading is learning but should be fun,too. This book has been fun and entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone seeking to escape even for a few pages at a time.
0805092919|5.0|My 15 month old brings me this book to read to him everyday.  I have always been a Bill Martin fan.  It's a must for wee ones.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is a seamless meld of the depths of pondering of mortality and young love. It actually makes you think. It is flawlessly written, had brilliant characters, and can make grown men weep their steely hearts out. I hadn't really read a book for fun in a long time and this book sparked my interest in reading again. It is a gorgeous story that transcends one particular audience; I recommend that all of humanity reads it.
B0091REZMW|2.0|It's hard to see the items on the KINDLE FIRE<br />But I like the game . And the fact that it is just like the Facebook app
B007WFTFG6|5.0|o far this has been my favorite of all the downloaded toddler apps. My 2 1/2 year old plays with it ALL of the time!!!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Author trusts reader (often children) to pick up on things without being told outright. I feels like discovering a wonderful secret as you read. Characters well drawn and all of the pieces fit together beautifully. Beautiful as the film is, the book is better by far.
0395389496|5.0|We were so excited to receive this book. I did NOT realize that it came with a disc to listen to the book OR that it came with a very nice polar express ornament. The packaging was very nice as well. All I had to do was wrap and stuff under the tree.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my eldest son.<br />He was very happy with them.<br />They arrived quickly and were well packaged.<br />I think this was an excellent value.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|A great read! Just as good as the series on TV. Good descriptive passages and even though I dont normally read fantasy type books, this one really gets you in.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my eldest son.<br />He was very happy with them.<br />They arrived quickly and were well packaged.<br />I think this was an excellent value.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The book, A Higher Call. An Incredible True Story of Combat And Chuvalry... This is a wonderful book so far. it shows much courage,understand and respect even between enemies. the kind of book i like.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|Beautifully conceived and artistically developed, UP delivers a story that brought tears to my eyes in the first 10 minutes. The movie is a love story, an adventure, a generational buddy story. I continue to quote from the movie with my dog: SQUIRREL!  Love this movie.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|This is one of those books you want to talk about as you read because you feel the Berglunds are indeed your neighbors. It is a wonderful exploration of the complexities of modern life and marriage, which isn't to say the Berglunds' experience in sum is necessarily typical. Yet we all have seen different aspects of the Berglund family in real-life messy divorces, estranged children, compromises between desire and security, affairs, and unsympathetic parents. Perhaps they don't always combine into one family, but other than the Lalitha subplot and the Berglunds' initial romance, I did find the novel believable.<br /><br />What I enjoyed (if that is the word) so much about \\"Freedom\\" is that I felt I understood what it was like to be in such an emotionally complicated family, how couples stay together against their better judgement, and how slights are forgiven or accumulate over the years.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The vulnerability of the characters was intense and defined then. They grew in themselves and claimed their future. It also should help all remember the impact our behaviors have on children - good, bad & indifferent
1452101248|5.0|I make at least 2 recipes from this cookbook every week. The food is so exciting! Although I have been vegetarian for many years I never ate or cooked as well as I do now. I tell everyone I know, vegetarian or not, to get ahold of it. I've impressed the in-laws and dinner parties and certainly am much healthier for it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Nice large buttons, make this App a winner, and great for someone who wears glasses. One of the better calculator Apps.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I had forgotten how well Conan Doyle conveys the style of the era. Holmes was such a unique character and Watson so gullible.
B006VREHRS|5.0|OK, so I'm a big fan, but I find this show to be so wonderful, with incredible production values, impeccable acting, wonderful directing, and attention to detail that always delights me.  So I'll buy every season and look forward to watching it again and again.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I needed to get caught up with the series before Season three started this month. I had never seen it before but it was suggested by a relative that I start following the series.  Am glad I listened to her.  The 1 and 2 editions did the job.  I loved it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Check out the \\"how it should have ended\\" videos for TDK and TDKR.  It's the best kind of review you can really give.
0064430227|5.0|This book inspired me from a very early age. It showed me that if you use your imagination and keep a positive attitude then there is nothing you can't achieve. Harold also inspired me to start drawing, when I was younger I drew on everything just like him, now that I'm older I draw on everything. This book is highly recommended to people of all ages.
B004WKH516|5.0|This is a film-noir from the 1940's.  Do not expect high-tech intrigue and lots of electronic snooping and violence.  The movie is not completely true to  Cain's novel, but I find it far better.<br /><br /> Mildred (Crawford) is a lower-class woman who dreams and schemes of attaining a higher status in life for her children.  Mildred separates from her unemployed husband.  Using hard work and some sexual perseverance, she opens a chain of restaurants and raises her financial status substantially.  Her spoiled teenaged daughter, Vida (Ann Blyth), wants even more, including Mildred's current playboy paramour/ future husband, Monte.  Mildred is so blinded by the sudden death of her youngest and sweetest child, that she continues to push harder and harder to please and win the ungrateful and spoiled Vida.  No amount of material wealth and hard work by Mildred seems to be respectable enough for Vida.<br /><br /> Vida's conniving scheme to wed an unsuspecting, naive, rich boy for his money pushes Mother and daughter even farther apart in a violent argument.  So with no income, Vida winds up singing (scantily clad) in a \\"dive\\" bar on the waterfront.  (This seems rather of out of place, considering Vida's snobbish attitudes).  But it still makes for great, sleazy, melodrama.<br /><br />Poor Mildred just cannot stop trying to regain the love of Vida. She buys Monte's (now in debt) mansion, marries him, and redecorates the joint just to please her daughter.  Then invites Vida back \\"home.\\"<br /><br />But the movie began with a murder and is told in flash-back. So, Who dunnit?  Vida? Mildred? Vida's father? Or Mildred's con-artist investor/advisor (Jack Carson)?  and where will Mildred end up after all of the drama?<br /><br />Crawford won an Academy Award for her aggressive, tough, and hard-edged \\"scenery chewing\\".  I also enjoyed the performance by Eve Arden, as Mildred's friend and partner in the restaurants.  As a \\"strong woman\\" in a small role, she coldly and sarcasticallytells the shocked, prissy tax auditor, \\"Come here and let me bite you, darling boy!\\"  A fantastic one-liner!
B009JBZH54|5.0|THE ENTIRE DARK KNIGHT SERIES IS EXCELLENT, GLAD SOMEONE FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT, CHRISTIAN BALE IS BY FAR THE BEST BATMAN EVER CAST, WOULD REALLY LOVE TO SEE THE SERIES CONTINUE AS LONG AS ITS DONE IN THE SAME MANNER..
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Shinedown has been my favorite band since Leave a Whisper. First song I ever heard was .45 and I was hooked. I actually had this album already but when Amazon offered it for .99 I had to get it. Shinedown has the potential to be the next Journey, and that's saying A LOT!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Yes, it's a little hypertext-y, jumping between topics, but that didn't bother me. What impressed me was her ability to point out gender inequities - in business, the arts and especially comedy - without using comedy as a way of caving but instead to sharpen the points she was making. Really well done. I knew she was smart before; now I think she's pretty much brilliant (and a very hard worker, which particularly resonates w/me).
B0076UXKDG|5.0|I was VERY hesitant to order an actual nikon brand grip due to the price compared to 3rd party.<br /><br />I Currently own a Grip from Meike for my D7000. While it does everything the nikon does, it often times stops giving power, or shows wrong battery info (pulling battery out and putting it back it fixes it for a while or until power off) This was ultimately the main reason I bought the nikon, because it ALWAYS has to work for me, I'm a combat Photographer for the army and dead batteries are not a easy fix for me.<br /><br />Eitherway.<br /><br />I knew that the Nikon would be better build quality however, I am still amazed at how much of a difference the quality is. Do I think the build quality was worth the 368$ I paid for a new one?<br /><br />YES I DO.<br /><br />Every single bit, every moving part, every still part feels and looks like it was built to outlast me. I have no doubts about putting this on my camera and hanging onto only it.<br /><br />The locking wheel has no wobble but feels like it has a good amount of tension, it does not free spin or come loose.<br /><br />The multi-select command Analog is stiff and clicks in each direction, it feels great. My Meike is super loose and does not feel good.<br /><br />The paint on the AF-ON button is the same quality and kind as the buttons on the camera, No rubbing off! my Meike has no paint on its button anymore.<br /><br />The shutter button feels the same as the camera, perfect.<br /><br />The front/rear dials are the same as on the body of the camera, they feel perfect.<br /><br />On my Meike the screw that the camera is mounted to the grip by is loose, I can grab it with my fingers and shake it around or free spin it. I CAN NOT do this on the Nikon, Its so rugged and well built.<br /><br />I was happy to see the battery tray holds 8 AA batteries rather than Six. 8 AA 2650 MAH batteries adds a ton of extra shoot time.<br /><br />The trays, while still plastic like the Meike, are of a much higher quality.<br /><br />The door for the trays on the Nikon are super well built, the latch turns with a bit of friction rather than free turning like the Meike. More security.<br /><br />Nikon Pros:<br /><br />Best build quality that can ever be put into a battery grip, no expense spared making these grips<br />8 AA batteries<br />Same paint on the buttons as on the camera, wont rub off<br />no wobble in lock dial or noise/creeks<br />metal construction<br /><br />Cons:<br />none, not even the price is a con to me, I got what I paid for!<br />included pouch only holds the spare battery tray, I could care less about that however I wish it would fit the actual grip since its such a nice pouch, super good quality for only holding a tray.<br /><br />Meike Pros:<br />Functions as a Grip<br />holds extra batteries<br />50$<br /><br />Meike Cons:<br />Poor construction quality.<br />Paint rubs off of buttons<br />Locking dial wobbles and free spins<br />different shutter button than camera<br />does NOT feel secure or safe on the camera<br />OFTEN TIMES BATTER IS NOT DETECTED OR STOPS WORKING, GRIP STILL FUNCTIONS BUT CAMERA SWITCHES TO INTERNAL BATTERY<br /><br />A word on price:<br />People complain about the price of this grip, and I agree, over 400$ or the first price of around 800$ is mad. I would never pay that and this is not worth that, I could pay a Great Nikon 50 F1.2 for that price and take great images rather than holding a camera sideways.<br /><br />However, Its under 400$ now and is sitting at a fair price point to me.<br /><br />The build quality makes up for the cost, I doubt it will ever break. Its as rugged as any Nikon pro camera and made with the same level of Quality. When holding it you feel secure, no worries. You don't have to wonder \\"is that little cheap screw really going to hold my 3,300$ camera to this grip?\\" It doesn't creek or make noises. and You can mount it to a tripod, sideways, and not wonder if the tripod mount is going to break the whole thing inhalf.<br /><br />You do not ever have to worry about this not working, or not showing battery information. It always works, every time.<br /><br />If you can afford a 3000$ camera, you should be able to afford a 380$ grip that will vastly improve the feel, ease of use, and battery life of your camera.<br /><br />5/5 stars. A truly happy customer from me.<br /><br />(Side note, my item shipped from the US to Afghanistan in 4 days.  amazing.)
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Very fun and creative. My 4 year old daughter loves it. Keeps her attention and she loves showing her creations.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I got off and the next day I had about 7 notifications saying all of your family's are ready to give you coins.Please fix this!!!
B005ZUR724|5.0|best game ive found. you dont have to buy a bunch of extra crap to have a fun time. Love it...
0425252868|5.0|I enjoyed this book very well and recommend it 100%.It would be great if it was made into a movie but it should stick to the human element that the writer has given us. I would love to tell you about my favorite parts of the book but do not want to spoil it for anyone. I also learned more about how some of the German military personnel felt about the war, their leaders, etc.<br />I will say it again, I do recommend this book 100%.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Suprisingly good shoot me up. Brought back the grittiness to Dredd. Can't wait for the sequels. My only complaint is the cheesy bikes. The Dredd bikes are supposed to be awesome with really big wheels I.e.Batman dark night so fix this!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's hard to imagine, but better than the 1st book. It kept me in suspense from the 1st page to the last
1439152799|5.0|I hated to see the book end! Great characters in a great setting.  Can't wait to read her other books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I wanted to read this book before the movie came out. Another great book by this author. It ws a fast read ..very well written. I hope the movie is just as good.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Love massive destruction? Check!<br />Love amazing visual? Check!<br />Love intriguing and complex story? Check!<br />Love fan service? Check!<br /><br />Just buy it!
0061743526|5.0|I am an avid reader.  I have read hundreds of books in my life-time.  However, this is by far, my favorite book!  I recommend this for every age.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|It doesn't happen often enough, but sometimes I come across a book where the author has that rare ability to describe the most ordinary, fleeting moment or feeling and you know exactly what it feels like... you just never were able to put into words.<br /><br />Wished I could have accompanied Harold on his journey.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good product for reading the news.  Then I heard about NewsHog so I installed it (on a Kindle Fire HD) and liked it better.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is good fun to help me unwind after a stressful day. Doesn't take much thinking - just aim and fire!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This product works just great on my Kindle Fire HD.  I previously used MSN weather on a pc, but I like AccuWeather on my Kindle better.  I have also started using AccuWeather on the pc.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is a great time waster and fun because almost everyone can be solved.<br />Play it all the time. lots of variety in the shuffle.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I was not sure that I wanted a case at all for my Kindle Fire HD.  I found that holding the Kindle Fire HD to watch a movie got pretty tiring after awhile, so I got this case because it can stand the Kindle up for viewing movies.  It works great.  I also like that it turns the Kindle Fire off when you close the case and turns it on when you open the case.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is great to have a calculator at your fingertips.  Ready to use at a moment's notice. Very cool.  If you don't have one get one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works very nice.  I am not into heavy duty calculating, but for simple math stuff, this works just fine.  Better than most cheap hand held calculators, and it goes more than 8 digits.
0061928356|4.0|This was a nice book for our book club discussion.  Easy to read and comparison of 2 different worlds we could be born into.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I always try to find a fun zoo game but I never can so now I found this one and I never stooped playing for 3 hours straight
B009O2XY12|5.0|Like it a lot!! Very entertainer and relax me so much. It's addictive!! Try it and you love it too. Thanks!!
B0031RS8UI|2.0|I found this book abit slow, and i got frastrated with it. The main charector seems abit silly. Not one of Kinsellas better stories.
0375507256|5.0|As technology advances and humans create more complex societies, there is still that constant effect of human nature shaping everyone's actions. In a remarkable effort to illustrate this idea in a work of fiction, David Mitchell had to create new plot devices and structures to not totally lose the reader. Whether he successfully answers the questions he posed is up for debate, and some of the plot devices were just beautiful fireworks void of meaning.<br /><br />But he did just attempt to map human nature into a Cloud Atlas, and that if anything makes this novel worthwhile.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really like reading John Grisham's attorney/law fiction, his other attempts, not so much.  I was a little slow to catch the drift of this story and thought it was a little coincidental to really happen.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'll agree, the ads are annoying, but it's a free app! For me, they only pop up before every game, and they're not hard to get rid of... and the game is fantastic! Lots of play options and very responsive for the most part. I'm glad there are advertisers that will pay the developers, so I can play this game for free! I'm a fan!
B0097JYVAU|5.0|This was the best book that I have read in years. Nate has shed a spotlight on the subject of forecasting and prediction, it cuts through the fluff and delivers the essense in simple to understand context. This is exactly what I deliver in my Anacapa Intelligence courses. Great book that I am recommending to everyone regardless of your industry. The book is a revelation.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham always surprises me in the way he can build you up to the conclusion - and this time he caught me by surprise. I just find his story telling terrific.
B0096YJDNQ|3.0|I don't have a GPS device on my device so it will not work properly. I wish I could use this it looks like a nice program.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Light easy movie.  Good escape that had some fun musicand provided some sincere laughs.  Still saying a couple choice lines to one another.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I have this on my kindle and love the fact I don't have to be online to play and can play anythime.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|It is just not the Christmas season without this movie.  Not sure who is going by reviews on this one.  Does anyone not know it?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was very good.  It is more of a tweener book but has great characters and story line.  I loved how everything came together.  Definately recommend.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I have enjoyed the two Angry Birds I already have.  Learning to play them was successfully intuitive.  I don't find this one to be so.
B00957T6X6|5.0|My husband and I are both reading the books, and he is ahead of me. These books rock!  The characters are so real u feel like you know them, and some u wish u didn't ;)
B004GHNIRK|5.0|My favorite stage musical is this one.  So---what can be wrong about the book?  I know it's long, but I can do that.  I'm looking forward to it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is one of the best reads/books that I have read and really enjoyed this book. Jamie McGuire really makes the characters come to life in the story. Can't wait for them to make a movie of this !!!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I had never even seen a Mahjong game and thought it might be interesting.  It's adictive.  Love the sounds and music.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read the book because I knew the movie was about to come out  - I would always rather read a book before seeing the movie.  Both were great but the book kept me reading into the night.  I thought it was beautifully descriptive and very suspenseful.  The only part I wasn't thrilled with was the end of Pi's experience, just before he gets saved.  I didn't understand the last new character at all.  I did love this book though.  I recommend reading the book and then seeing the movie.  Both great.
B009X01FJS|5.0|Everything works as described. I liked to have better protection and flexibility of settings either vertical or horizontal, this is perfect for me. Like others said if you want a compact cover this is not what you want.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Like a lot of this games the price is fair for the content. Only real complaint was the stop of game play trying to get me to rate it five stars.
0307740919|5.0|A new novel from Toni Morrison is an event to relish. With a literary career spanning into its fifth decade, she continues to produce work as powerful and unforgettable as any fiction published in this day and age. In her most slender work of fiction to date, Home lacks none of the storytelling ingenuity and character depth that are hallmarks of every one of her works. A veteran of the Korean War, Frank Money returns to the states fortunate enough to have escaped physical wounds. More distressingly, though, he suffers from flashback moments of nightmarish anguish over the atrocities he committed as a soldier. He is also distressed over any thought of returning to his god-forsaken hometown of Lotus, Georgia. When a letter arrives from a resident of his childhood town telling him that his younger sister, Ycidra (\\"Cee\\"), has fallen victim to a crime, Frank bolts back to the place he despises in order to save her. The central story of Frank and Cee is compelling and tender, a recounting of life's struggle to survive and find ways to forgive and move on. Morrison packs surprises and shocks, and the ending is tremendously arresting, sad, and beautiful in its power to explore how any transgression can be faced with dignity and how solace can be found in a redeeming act of grace. The main plot is supplemented with side stories, full of their own intrigue. Even in such a short novel like Home, Morrison's range of narrative is extraordinary, how everything feels so authentic and every character, no matter how minor, feels so real. Her novels are never one straightforward story; they are canvases of insight, interwoven tableaus of places and people. Every detail is fascinating, her prose vibrant and fresh, reminding us how incredibly brilliant Toni Morrison is. In its brevity, Home is another testament that with each work Toni Morrison breaks new ground as an artist and re-establishes the measure of what every writer should do: challenge their self and continue to produce workthat bristles with emotion, packs a punch, and evokes admiration.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this was going to be a light read.  In the beginning it reminded me of the movie The Wedding Date which was fine. I like the scene in the movie that he has her leaned against the car.  This book was much more than that. I won't get into details because I was surprised and liked it that way.  I truly enjoyed the story and the characters.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my father who is a huge action movie guy, and he loved it!
B004MYF4SS|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read this year. The author transports one to the Hebrides and wraps one in it's hostile atmosphere. I have ordered the second book in this Lewis trilogy. Can't wait to receive it!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|The product was in perfect condition and the movie was amazing!  If you love action movies, you will love this product!!
B005HSL626|3.0|I have found many more apps thet are more  fun and challenging than this game so I don't use this app anymore
B000002L7J|5.0|This has remained one of my favorite LPs since it's release. I was 36 then & now I'm....well... I recently purchased the CD with How Soon is Now so I wouldn't have to play that separately from their singles LP. To me this was cutting edge lyrics for its day -talking about sexual & physical abuse at school (The Headmaster Ritual), corporal punishment (Barbarism Begins at Home) & of course that vegan anthem, Meat is Murder. Morrissey's voice is amazing & unique & Johnny Marr's guitar blazes. Morrissey's lyrics nail angst & lonliness - What She Said describes my depressed bookworm teen years perfectly.  For me, the only song that sounds like filler is I Want the One I Can't Have -everything else is delicious.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Keep on having issues with the network error. My news feed does not update and it says I have a network error. It's happen several times the last couple of weeks. And yes all other apps on the Kindle Fire work fine.
B007F5S1B8|5.0|The only Smiths album I owned & loved was Meat is Murder - don't know why I'd never looked into their other stuff, but after reading some reviews, decided to buy Queen is Dead. I played it, then immediately played it again, then played several cuts, then played the whole thing again, and wondered why I'd deprived myself of this LP for over 20 yrs! The title cut just takes off...left me breathless. Frankly Mr. Shankly is hilarious. My personal favorite is Bigmouth Strikes Again. The ballads are stunning - can't think of one downside to this LP & the digital remastering is a plus. The Smiths excel in exposing our white underbelly - Morrissey's lyrics always nail that tender spot we don't always allow others to see, plus he has that dry wit. Like good literature, the music isn't defined by the decade in which it was written. It doesn't sound dated today & would also have been at home in the 60s or 70s. I Know It's Over could have been written in the 40s or 50s & those painful lyrics almost beg for a smoke filled bar & a bottle of scotch. This is an album I'll be returning to again & again.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|It's A great show, It's not what most are used to watching on TV<br />Which Makes it Oh so good to see.<br />Open your mind
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|When I started reading I could not put it down. I wish there had been a different ending.  It is worth your time.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|Perfect time and just the look I have wanted.  Easy to read except for the date window.  Could not ask for better.  Gave one to my grandson for Christmas -- he loves it too!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Good read - good story with interesting twists and good action.  If you like a good Rapp book this is one you'll like.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I always enjoy a good time travel story, and this movie brings a new perspective to this age old topic. The acting, action and directing was superb. Cutting between the two halves of the main character was well done, and maintained the pace of the movie. Even though the plot wasn't magnificent or particularly unexpected, this was a great movie worth seeing.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|My all time favorite! I must've read this book over 10 times and I've bought copies for a bunch of friends too, hehe
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's an older game but it's fun to play.  This game can consume lots of time.  Could be rated 5 stars.<br />\
075669812X|5.0|This book was a gift to our grandson, and something he wanted to add to his collection of Lego items. This provides him with additional information about the Lego Ninjago products.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|got this for my 9 year old daughter when her dad's not home to play. she loves it but doesn't like that it's harder to win. lol
0393343405|5.0|The book is incredibly well written, intriguing and hard to put down. His presentation on Lucretius is well documented & intriguing & brilliant.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|this game is so much fun. my whole family has a blast playing. it's like angry birds only better. the levels get more challenging but are still fun. great reward for my kids to play after the read a chapter of their book.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|it is very fun and addicting but it takes way to long to get the next car or even a.y of the upgrades
B007N5YIUS|5.0|ads are not a problem. the close by hitting pause. angry birds is always a fun way to spend free time!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I have read Gillian Flynns other novels and was less impressed with this one! It was well written and provocative, but the characters were boring and very predictable! I was hoping I was missing something and read each chapter waiting for the unpredictable plot twist that didn't come. It was especially disappointing after all the good press and reviews it received. If you haven't I suggest you read her others, particularly Dark Places.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great free tool. easy to use as it should be, i recommended this to anyone needing a basic adding tool
0399256385|5.0|We like Spot books, and this one has lift-flaps as well as the board-book style and strength.  I expect it to be a good baby gift.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I love this book.  Cheryl's story is truly inspiring and it was a very exciting and interesting read! I've recommended it to many of my friends.
B00785P2QC|4.0|game is addicting and fun but its hard to earn investments.  love the easy goals and tutorial combined.  it leave nothing to question.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This is a great series and I definitely enjoy.  I takes about one hundred pages to understand what is going on with all the characters, but definitely worth the read
B000XUBC5E|5.0|This book was really great to read. Did he do it? No? Mystery woman, girl, man.....who did it???? Why is &#34;The Ghost&#34; seeminly on our hero's side? or is he?<br />Excellent mystery!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I highly recommend these books.  I only read the first one but from what I understand it is the best of the series.
B001FB4W0C|3.0|Amazing season, but there are a lot of formulaic plots that harken back to S1/2s monster of the week format. Castiel and Chuck are pretty much the only things that save this season from being awful. The angel struggling to understand humanity and deal with his feelings for Dean and the \\"Prophet\\" wanting to help Sam and Dean but being unable to directly interfere and only watch and hope they make the right choices make this a very riveting season. Those guys are amazing actors. I think I am in love with Rob Benedict.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much!  The plot moved along nicely, and there was a surprise chapter, just when you think the story should be ending!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|There is no doubt that THIS season is the best season ever in Supernatural. It honestly should have ended with Swan Song and that certain scene. SN fans will know what I am talking about. It would have been a perfect ending to a perfect series. I still watch the new episodes, but I don't really consider them to be anything but schlock compared to Season 5. THIS is what a TV show should be. Angels, demons, Lucifer, and even, dare I spoil it, GOD. This season was superb and nothing I've seen since can compare. My favorite episodes were Changing Channels (it was funny, but also very serious in the end) and Swan Song (God is at last revealed, and the Winchesters' story honestly comes to an end). S6/7/8 seem to mostly rely on humor and snark, a la Crowley/Balthasar. I also REALLY hated the corruption of Castiel in the other seasons.<br /><br />If you watch or buy ANY Supernatural season, make it this one. It is best if you know the story, but you can watch and love this without even knowing what is going on. I convinced my boyfriend to watch this season and he knew nothing about SN. He finished this and became a huge SN fan just from watching this season.
0140274111|5.0|Bought for my stepdaughter when she was going thru an Audrey Hepburn phase.  She loved it.  I think we could all use a dose of the book before the movie...
B000X5SPBI|3.0|I bought this solely for one episode: Mystery Spot, in which Gabriel takes an even greater interest in the Winchesters than before. I love all of Supernatural, however, but would not have bought this if it weren't for the Mystery Spot episode. The last 3 episodes are very good, and the storyline is much more involved than the Monster-of-the-week format that was S1 and S2. I really liked how the episodes were FINALLY starting to connect to each other. S1/S2 had most episodes that didn't even deal with the main plot and I really hated that. I wanted Sam and Dean's story, not some random mishmash of \\"oh we need to vanquish this demon\\" stuff. S3 had plenty of that, but not enough for me to dislike the season.<br /><br />Overall, worth the price. I got it cheap.
0634060384|5.0|If you don't have it, you need it.  If you sing, you need it.  If you play any instrument you need it.  Make sure to get the right version.  A MUST HAVE.
B008I34YYY|5.0|Iron Sky is NOT a Sci-Fi movie by any stretch of the imagination and if you go into this movie thinking you're going to see something awesome in the vein of Sci-Fi brilliance, then wipe this thought from your head and think of this movie as one of those parodies you've seen, trust me, you'll be a lot better off.<br />I was expecting more when I turned this movie on but when I realized what I got myself into, I was perfectly satisfied with it and found myself laughing at it.<br />Nazi invasion from the moon after retreating to the dark side and colonizing there for 70 years sounded like a real barn burner of a movie and probably would've been if they took it seriously but that being said, it isn't and they didn't and all things being equal, it is what it is.<br />And with a parody of Sarah Palin as President?, kinda puts the topping on the whole thing.<br />It's great as a rental but not entirely sure of the purchase value. Funny as hell though.
B0016OM3TU|5.0|It's been a long time since I looked at this.  But I thoroughly enjoyed it.  And I think it is worth a review!
B008J05EL8|3.0|EITH EXCEPTION to having to buy at additional cost, the fonts to be able to change a font is a ridiculous thing they've got going here....Had I read the reviews FIRST, I would have moved on to find another product besides this one for the price that ALREADY INCLUDES the different fonts within the program!!!!! Would have given a 5 star if you would have included it instead you guys were light in the head for seperating it!!!!!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Look it isn't a bad book.  I just think it was a bit overly predictable as it raced to the end.  And It falls somewhere in between the soulful twisted triangle of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight Series and the uber chick lit lightweight HP Mallory Jolie Wilkins series.  The second novel in this group was actually better.  And one hopes that Harkness will continue to improve.  I kind of hope she puts this down after 3 and tries a different story.  Or a spinoff like Gabaldon did with her John Grey stories.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is a digital version of my favorite book. You can't go wrong with that. It was a great addition to my kindle.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is a great short movie to view around the holidays!  We watch it every Christmas Eve.  The story is simple, yet very enjoyable.  The animation tells the story, no words needed.  This is my second copy.  The first was damaged, but it DID contain the David Bowie intro.  I hope the used copy I just ordered does as well!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I was completely hooked from the beginning. I'm really not sure what made me obsessed about it, but I finished it in less than 24 hours! I loved the characters and the idea of a worldwide easter egg hunt. I don't think you need to be a major geek to love this book. I know very little about classic video games or the 80s and still loved it. I'm very impressed with the fact that this is the author's first book, I certainly look forward to reading other books by him in the future.
B008KE3960|1.0|I can't open this game on my Droid 2.  It freezes on startup.  1 star is all that's fair since it won't even load.
B004UPAIDK|5.0|This and the original Evil Dead are two of my favorite movies. They capture the essence of a horror movie that isn't just trying to scare you, but also make you laugh and enjoy the ride. It's downright silly, even slapstick at some points, but it still finishes as a fantastic film that I would recommend to anyone.
B005WMADYE|5.0|Racing, war, and gambling.. redline is an amazing anime film.. its worth looking at the extras to see what the team of artists did to make this true work of art.. I found myself wanting to see more of races.. maybe one day we will see a yellowline blueline or other race to compliment this story.
B002GTZSZU|5.0|Dramatic and funny. Saw it when I was much younger and thought my band high school band student would enjoy it. He did.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|I would order this for any gifts!<br />Any child would like it- soft, cute, well made, and the perfect size.<br />It is adorable!
B000I3W1XS|3.0|Say what you will of the movie itself, its plot, etc, but this 'review' is strictly about the cost. Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, and as far as I know several of the TNG movies are all free with amazon prime membership. However, this one costs money. I paid my dues, a while ago when I bought my kindle fire, and got the amazon prime. I have taken full use of the free prime movies, but I must say that to randomly charge for this one is almost insensible. If every other star trek episode and movie is free, except this one, then I'll gladly pay netflix to stream all of the films and episodes as well as the many other great t.v. episodes and movies that Amazon simply doesn't have. Thanks but no thanks amazon.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Call me old fashioned but I would like to have a final resolution on what happened to the killer. I also would rather Max showed more compassion toward Nathans circumstances in jail,  considering his own background. To me, it made it hard to sympathize with Malcolm's false imprisonment. The plot though was very good. I read this book in two days. It's the first book I've finished in a long time.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I bought this book to motivate my 9 year old to read since he likes being on the kindle so much so He reads 2-3 chapters a night for his reading log, the book is keeping him interested. He says it is funny and very good.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I love it!!!!<br />I will definitely recommend this book to lots of people!!!  Award winning book. Touched my heart all the way to the bottom right down to the core
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app really makes it easy to know how much charge is left in the battery and in the listing of how that converts into time is fantastic.<br /><br />Cvdmvega2@msn
0007350740|5.0|Bad Pharma is actually a fairly scary book to pick up when you’ve just collected a prescription from the chemist but I’d heard a lot about Bad Science (which I’ve since read) and thought Bad Pharma would be incredibly interesting. I certainly wasn’t wrong.<br /><br />This is pretty much a damaging expose of the pharmaceutical industry’s involvement in modern medicine. Not necessarily their manufacture and distribution of tablets that do improve people’s lives every day but more the unnecessary peddling of drugs that either do very little or are no more effective than drugs already on the market. We’ve all seen the washing powder ads for something ‘new and improved’, only to find out two months later that it’s got one slight miniscule change. How ludicrous would it be if the drug companies did something similar and then got it under patent for 10 years so they could charge incredibly high prices for it?  Well, they do.<br /><br />Delving into issues such as pricing, drug trials, suppression of research and trial reports, Goldacre uncovers how strong the hold over our medication is and calls for changes across the board, citing things that patients, doctors, governments, researchers and the drug companies can do.<br /><br />I’m sure Goldacre didn’t make any drug rep friends via this book – and I’m quite sure he doesn’t care. It’s refreshing to read something that is so focussed on what’s right, regardless of the waves it makes. That said, having now gone back and read Bad Science, it’s not really a surprise. This is an absolutely fascinating read for anyone who has had any involvement with our health system or ever taken any medication whatsoever. So, that’s pretty much everyone!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great sci-fi read! I would recommend it to anybody. Hopefully this will round out the requirement for seventeen words, or maybe not. Blah, Blah, and Blah. Still a great read.
B006HL9G10|5.0|Thia app has been wonderful to use after doing a yoga session with the Simply Yoga app. I again like being able to set my own parameters for my session. I also found it a wonderful concept to think of the number of people around the world meditating with this app at the same time. Community intention and realization is needed for the world to be a better place:)
B009S5IZJQ|5.0|I've love Zucchero's music for several years now. I almost got to see him when he came to Boston but there was a blizzard and I was unable to attend. I ordered the album from Germany so this is the European version of the album. It contains a few of his previous songs but others with Cuban and salsa flavors to most of them. Of course I love it because it's Zucchero ! Thank you Zucchero.
B000L53D4O|4.0|I guess as a walker toy I was kind of expecting a little resistance in the wheel.  Instead it slips out from under my baby niece who is just learning to walk.  We have bare floors.  Other than that she loves to play with it while sitting on the floor.
0345803493|4.0|I ordered this book for my wife and she loves the series. The first 130 pages looked like they had been soaked but dried out. No mold or other damage and they were still readable.

B005VPRDAY|5.0|I use this for therapy and the little girls love the LEGO Friends collection. LEGOs provide the opportunity to work on so many skills, I think they are an excellent toy
B005UDD1R6|4.0|I like it.<br />I use this app for videos, pictures and music.<br />I like the fact that it can access multimedia contect from other devices such as laptop or HDD in a wireless network.<br />Quality for video playback in this mode is not as good.
0812979656|5.0|With a five star rating on this product, it may seem strange to some that I am starting my review out with a warning that this novel isn't for everyone. It's my favorite book, but I know others who have found the novel to be too heavy, tedious, or slow. The first chapter, I will admit, is a difficult read, but I really loved the rest of the novel despite of (and because of) it's fragmentation, humanity, compassion, and plot. Every time i read this book, or even just a small part of it, I am wowed by the poetic prose and the care with which Ms. Roy constructs every scene and character. And the imagery is amazing, I truly can't get enough of this book, but I will say that it's not a typical page turner, and it may be a hard read for some.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This is ideal for developing kids creatiity and for adults is a good tool to spend a good and fun time.
B009Y6X65C|4.0|Very enjoyable, Bonamassa is my hero, and delivers as he always does, with searing solos, cool songs, and dead on vocals
B004Y1WCDE|3.0|It is fine, I have not yet being capable of playing multimedia content in my TV LED SHARP but in my kindle works ok.<br />I feel many of this application requires more work. They are ok but they do not look professional, many bugs and could be more  user frindly. Still learning.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I have to admit I was skeptical at first even with everyone talking about, so I gave in and I am so glad I did. I give 4 stars left me wanting more......and after reading this the last...I still want more... more about their life and their erotic sex....more of the hurdles they continue to overcome......this is a great series. Hands down to E L James...I look forward to more.....
B0095R64AO|4.0|Funny with depth and meaning. The movie is about life's knocks and how we handle them whether considered right or wrong.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Although THG is one of my favorite stories, I was a little disappointed with the end of the saga. It felt like Suzanne rushed to finish this book and I wasn't satisfied. If I try to be more specific, I'll end up talking too much and giving spoilers, so I'll leave it at that.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I don't think this is his best work...I think it could have been about 100 pages shorter really. I do like the character John Corey, but I can see other readers' comments about his character - some of the comments are a bit over the top and take away from the realistic feel off the novel. I also thought the grand finale left me a little underwhelmed when compared to a few of Corey's previous missions. That said, I still think DeMille blows away many of the other authors of this genre.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was a great experience for me it was completely funny and it really shows a middle schoolers life
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Great acting.  Loved how the younger character acted a lot like his older self and took on Bruce Willis' characteristic.
B008YI91HS|5.0|I purchased the Jurassic Park on Amazon Instant. Whereas they offered an HD version for $15, I got the cheaper $10 regular version. Luckily it still showed up widescreen on my HD tv, and the overall quality was great.<br /><br />The movie itself is awesome! It's a well written and developed action/dinosaur flick. I don't know what more you'd want! For a movie which came out 20 years ago, the special effects still look quite realistic, and I think I would rate the movie as high had it come out today then as I did when it came out two decades ago.<br /><br />So the five stars go toward both the streaming quality of the movie, as well the movie itself - truly one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never cried so much from a book. I fell in love with every single character. My life is forever changed.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|I couldn't figure out how to use this game so I deleted it.  Instructions were vague and it seemed to 'highjack' my reader.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept my attention beginning to end!!  I cried I laughed l smiled, I felt it all! Thank you Colleen Hoover
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Still trying to figure out how to use it.  Finding instructions on how to use app is a bit look looking for a needle in a haystack.

B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love it and I could play it all day! Good graphics, and cool quests! I love the animals and I love bringing them into the park!
B005LAII08|5.0|Definitely not what I was expecting from a Disney princess movie. I still liked it though. Funny with great music, and an even better story. Almost got a tear from me. Haha
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would say this book is just like the movie! I Think u will love this book just as much as ido!!!!!!!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Just as described, brand new never opened. The show is so cool to watch, especially on blue ray. Highly recommended.
B008X8P8A8|5.0|Hope they expand or make more of TW Battles! I never had to buy exp either, made it more challenging!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The chapters keep you intrigued to continue one by one...you cannot help but want to read cover to end  without putting it down.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love the book 11/22/63.  I just wish I could make the font larger.  I'm using my iPad instead of an actual Kindel, maybe that's the problem.  Other than that, it's great!
B005HZJ2XY|4.0|Of the three versions of this story frequently seen on movie channels, this is the best.  The beautiful New England scenery, the excellent background music which somehow conveys the Civil War period, the fine acting - all make this a very enjoyable rendition.<br /><br />I somewhat reluctantly have withheld the 5th star - possibly unfairly so.  I re-read Louisa May Alcott's book just recently.  My  conclusion was that because the book provides a much more comprehensive development of the lives of the four March daughters, no movie, within its modern time limitations, can really do justice to Alcott's plot.  While I liked the portrayal of Professor Bhaer very much in this latest version, I think the movie adaptation made him much more &#34;modern&#34; than the book would allow - more youthful in appearance, more advanced views of culture, a manufactured love scene, etc.<br /><br />But all in all - highly recommended!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was the bomb it was the best book ever I would read it a million times best book ever!!!!!!!!!
B008458O3S|3.0|Good concept but will become boring quickly.  The game is limited in depth.  I recommend this game only for individuals who want a quick game or those under age 12.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Well written even if a bit hard to understand do to the yorkshire accent that parts of it are written in but very inspiring and uplifting to see Colin and Mary not only growing physically but spiritually and emotionally as well definently a book that should be not only read but studied as well as there are many things to be taken from it
B00846REIS|1.0|If u want erotica without a good story, this is it. The basics were there but needed more details... needs to be sold. Seriously lacking depth.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|If you like irony and understatement, buy this book. Can be read with joy in spurts or a long weekend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What can you say about a basic calculator that works. It works fine for me and my phone and that's all.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I love movies that are history based and this is a great story. Parts of it are not for the faint of heart but the violence was worth watching to see this movie. You feel like you are living during prohibition in rural Virginia and the characters come alive as you find yourself pulling for the bootleggers. Definitely recommend and my husband loved it too.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|the title of my review pretty much sums it up. it is a lot to download, file size-wise. ppppttttt!!!! pppppttttt!!!!!
B000MD7OKY|5.0|One of my favorite Hitchcock movies!  Classic Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, both very elegant intelligence and it holds your interest until the very end.
B002WYH5N2|5.0|I have watched this movie 20 times or more.  it is one of my top favorite movies of all time.
B0086700CM|5.0|very addicting game. I love it. I moved from angry birds to this. I always have something to do when bored.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I loved this book! I read everything that Michael Connelly writes and truthfully  I love everything he writes so I may be biased. This case is different in that Harry works most of it alone and off duty.  He opens up a cold case from 20 years ago that leads him to a conspiracy and cover up.  Harry knows that he has to find the black box that will unlock the past and lead him in the right direction, much like a black box on a plane will tell what happened before the crash. This book races along with excellent writing and exciting investigation. You won't be disappointed!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|What a splendid group of artists!!! Amazing work!! Lovely music, could listen over and over!!<br />I would defiantly suggest this group to everyone!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Looks great and works as expected.  Don't know why it didn't come on my Kindle Fire in the first place.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read other books by Colleen Hoover and enjoyed them all.  Hopeless is my favorite.  I love a book that has many twists and keep me guessing.

0761163808|5.0|I bought this book as a gift to my friend who just had a new born baby. While some of my other peers questioned my decision to buy a book as a gift &#34;Uh you know that books are like the worst gift right?&#34; I was completely confident in my choice as I had thought about how this book may impact the rest of her life.<br /><br />First, as a small child/toddler whatever she will enjoy the pictures, moving pictures.<br /><br />Then her father and mother will read about the animals of the safari to her, strengthening the parent-child relationship.<br /><br />Then she can learn to read on her own, build reading skills that will be helpful the rest of her life. This is a real book, it will take time for the child to completely be able to read and understand, digest the material.<br /><br />Throughout this process she will also learn to appreciate wildlife, animals, and life.<br /><br />Now you think about this: fast forward to years later and the little newborn is now a young woman. One who has good relationship with her parents, who can read, and one who is kind and loving, because a person who likes animals, appreciates nature and understands the value of life is probably going to be kind and loving. Through this gift, I have prepared this little girl to be great girlfriend/wife material. Her dad is gonna be busy keeping the guys away.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good story and a good read.  Not a very steamy romance novel but overall a good read.  I might look at another book by this author
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This documentary starts as a documentary about something completely different than the direction it is intended to go. I started watching the MTV show \\"Catfish\\" and decided I needed to see where it all started. Amazing. I love it and I love Nev too, he's an awesome individual.
B0056TYT66|5.0|This card works well. Devices connected to it are bootable.<br />When I inserted the card in PCIe 1.0 x1 slot of my X58<br />chipset motherboard I got 180 Mb/s in Sata in USB3.

Instead of writing that the<br />card &#34;sucks&#34;, I scratched my head and connected the card to a PCIe 2.0 x8<br />slot. After that I got speed 336 Mb/s to my SSD drive, which is close<br />to that when I plugged it to a native SATA-III port at another computer<br />with X79 chipset. Yes, you can get SATA-III speed if you plug in a<br />correct PCIe 2.0 slot (x1 should be sufficient, I think).
B0091REZMW|4.0|If you didn't download this do it now. I'm having fun and just downloaded it, oh yeah kik me: thasswatshesaid
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I watched barely 1/4 of it. My husband watched a little more than that. It had more f bombs than any other movie you could possibly imagine. I was prepared for some nastiness but thought since it was the rated one it would have been a bit better.....wrong. Even IF I blurred out the vulgar in it, it wasn't too incredibly funny. It could have been a great movie if they didn't make it entirely for drunk young fools!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Realmente divertido y original. A mis hijos y a mi nos encanta, porque, además de divertido, los pone a pensar
B00785P2QC|3.0|To much Facebook interaction but other than that the game is fun. I would like the<br />Option to reset the game

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|While the other two Batman movies were excellent (and I do think that Christian Bale makes the best Batman ever!), this one is my favorite. We have plot twists, the usual love interest (also with a surprising twist), and a somewhat happy ending. And don't forget...Robin is introduced!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Everyone said this was a great book and i haven't read it until now. And it is a great book
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|The plot really drags in this film, but to develop the story line I suppose that was necessary. Imagine a couple who gave each other a cable tv package for their anniversary. They are sleeping in separate bedrooms and she is not happy about it. They are in a rut and she wants out. She books them into a couples therapy week, which he thinks is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of money. She leaves to go without him, but at the last minute he joins her on the plane. The rest is their counseling sessions and how they respond to their &#34;homework&#34; assignments. I'm glad I saw it, but probably won't see it again. Might recommend it if anyone asks, but can't imagine volunteering the recommendation.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|its so fun you get play with friend and you don't need Tobago an amazing artist also its fun from 3 and up
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this Game It is really good just like the Pc the only flaw is that not all the blocks are in creative mode there are no animals or night not even life you defiantly need to fix that but over all the game is Good.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it was one of those books that I couldn't put down.  It has a very interesting twist.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Its not as good as the first season, to much blood and gore and way to much sex. The story line keeps me watch the rest of the season.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was based when I first opened this book. Cancer books...ugh. but seriously, this is not a Nicholas sparks novel. It's raw and real and beautiful. And you will cry. For the living and the dead.

0765325950|5.0|My review will be very brief as you really have to read this book to experience the end.  I started reading this series when the first book was released in 1990.  23 years later, all I can say is the series ended wonderfully.  While at times, the series seemed to drag a little, the investment I made in continuing to read it was worth well worth it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Lots of fun to play!  keeps you busy for hours! I love how you can breed different dragons together to make completely new ones!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I bought this for my teenage granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it and will probably watch it over & over again!
B000FCKIFU|4.0|I always enjoy Baldacci novels and this was no exception. Lots of action and intrigue. Maybe not totally believable, but fun to read.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I bought it for my teenage granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it and will probably listen to it over & over again!
B007PF7MGS|4.0|Clearly written with many good examples by Dr. John McDougall, this book is a must for anyone looking for a clear explanation of how our diets determine our health outcome. Health is an asset much like money. We can either put it in the hands of professionals and accept the consequences, or we can determine our own outcome by taking responsibility for making decisions for ourselves.<br />This book provides invaluable information for anyone determined to change the course of their life and lifestyle in order to gain health and ultimately happiness.
0547848412|5.0|I bought this for my teenage granddaughter because she likes to read the book before watching it at the movie theater.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game. It is very addictive, but it challenges you a little more at each level. Good game to stretch your mind.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love Castle. Great complement of characters. Order was received in great time. No complaints on customer service. I do recommend.
0765325950|5.0|This book was awesome.  I don't care if you guys don't like paper books.  That's a horrible reason to give a book a bad rating.  Sanderson did an awesome job finishing off the series with this book.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love Castle. Great complement of characters. Order was received in great time. No complaints on customer service. I do recommend.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|I love this movie, I have watched it so many times.  Still love it.  Blu Ray is fantastic.  I saw it the first time in the movie theatre in 3D.  I don't have a 3D player at home, Blu ray is the next best thing.
B00AR5BYJY|5.0|This is a gentle story of community, fierce pride, strong spirit in the face of tragedy, loyalty and love.  Hugh Grant's low-key hesitant personality fits his character perfectly and I loved seeing Colm Meaney (of Star Trek fame) as the irascible Morgan the Goat who emerges as a hero in the end.  Enjoy!
B004EPZ070|5.0|I have watched this movie on HBO about a million times, had to buy my own copy, just in case they stop showing it.  Good story, good actors.
B006AN78XS|5.0|It is a perfect romantic flick. Good music, great Paris scenes. Owen Wilson kind of sounded just like Woody Allen when he mumbles awahy, ina positive way.<br />Wish they made the conclusion of the movie it a little more subtle  rather than spell it out, or if they made his fiance less irritating and more of a true conflict  rather than making him like an idiot to be with her.<br />Over all a great movie great story, acting, music, and all the paresian scenes  .
B004SIP7PS|5.0|This was awesome service.  I ordered this on Thursday afternoon, 12/19.  It was a late idea for a Christmas gift, so was just going to write a note and wrap it.  But within an hour or so I was notified the order was in process, within 3 hours it had shipped.  It was delivered on Christmas Eve (Monday).  The movie is fabulous--a family movie for older kids (though it implies an extramarital affair).  Younger kids might enjoy certain parts, but it isn't geared for young children.
B0057B8PT0|5.0|I was expecting this album to be more upbeat but I still love it. I've already ordered another one of his cd's
0316789798|5.0|Thismbook is so creative and uses simple shapes and lines to create lots of different animals.  My daughter loves to create and this book has been fun!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very well written and thought through. Not at all predictable or a copy of any other plot. Wish the series would go on....
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this game. It has great replay value. Time consuming yet you can walk away for days and nothing dies.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I originally got this for my 4 year old but she didn't like it. I tried it and I am hooked. My little one likes to look and feed the dragons but I think this would appeal to her more if it spoke so she didn't have to know how to read to play. Had a few problems with the app shutting down or losing connection. Fun easy and entertaining but wish it was not cash shop driven.
B0095R76EW|2.0|Typical chick flick. The acting was mediocre and the story line was average at best. Don't waste your money on this one. There are better movies out there.
B005FMZX9Q|1.0|The watch does not work, I'm in Colombia, is difficult and expensive to return it, I have to fix it on my own.

B001HN6922|3.0|I choose this rating not because of the movie. The movie is wonderful! Half way through the movie the disc started skipping. I wasn't pleased with that I doubt I'll buy used dvd's again.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|On my first listen I came away not grooving to it. It was no surprise because I usually have to listen to a cd two or more times before I get it. This one one came together on the third spin.This is a modern day gem. It has intelligent lyrics and the pecks of the guitar are very detailed with some nice beats. His voice is very good. I hope he finds success because he washes away most of what is heard on the radio. Highly recommended.
1593272774|5.0|My three boys absolutely love this book.  It's very basic reading, but gives you a fundamental understanding of the Lego.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Part 1 tells the story by alternating between the husband's real time narration of the investigation into his missing wife and the wife's diary of their five year courtship and marriage.  Just when you think you've figured out the dirty little secrets to this marital trainwreck Part 2 turns a lovely piece of reality fiction into a heart pounding mystery thriller.  Definitely worth the read!

B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is incredible. It has smooth graphics and fun and addicting gameplay. Don't be surprised if you find yourself spending hours on end playing this.

1439127700|5.0|Written for the average person, not the scholar, The Presidents Club refers to the group of men, former Presidents, who are still alive, who live in a rarefied atmosphere that only they, who have lived in the White House, can fully comprehend. They have been privy to the world's most dangerous information and secrets, made decisions on which the fate of the world depended, and only they can really understand and relate to each other. The premise of the Club is that these men can still contribute and perform an invaluable service to newly elected Presidents or previous Presidents in need of a helping hand or some advice on how to deal with certain issues.<br />The Club created strange bedfellows; enemies became friends, and sometimes, friends became enemies.<br />The beauty of the relationship is that it crosses party lines. Even when old grudges rear their ugly heads because of campaigns, which made one or another suffer the slings and arrows of their opponent, they rose above their own personal needs and did what they thought was best for the country, and they supported the President in power and took a backseat, when asked to help...almost always that is, there were those with egos that simply rose above the sitting President's requests and they pranced off as loose cannons to do their worst.<br />Written in an even-handed way, not showing bias toward a particular party or President, the book is easy to read but requires some patience. It covers the men who achieved the highest office, from Hoover to Obama. Often, there is so much information that the reader will have to put it down and return to it later, to reread it and try and remember what they either lived through or learned in school, to verify what they have read, to more fully appreciate the aid and succor offered by these men of great power, to each other, some leaving office in shame and disgrace and some entering or leaving office immortalized, larger than life, for either their contributions or theirpersonalities. The ability to relate to the people and to foreign powers is a gift not all had, and some often reached out for help to those that were still alive, that they could consider their brethren, while others resisted or had none to call upon.<br />The ability for each to sabotage another remained alive and well and often the case. The desire of some to remain powerful and involved was so all consuming that they forgot to put their country first and became more enamored of themselves and their \\"one right way\\", in defiance of the man currently in power in the White House. Some reached out to unite and others to divide, but generally, they did put the security of the country first, above themselves. It is nothing if it isn't \\"a good old boys club\\".<br />Many of the men were polar opposites, coming from different walks of life, different educational backgrounds, different philosophies. They were portrayed as human beings, as were their spouses, with their warts and foibles exposed so that some negative ideas I had were quashed and replaced by a more accepting view of the person. Above all, each suffered with the weight of their decisions and each entered the office with the desire to make the world a better place. This desire was often thwarted by politics and outside forces, coupled with the fact that their desires were not always universal.<br />Soon, it also becomes obvious that each will use the power of the office to bend the rules, often ignore or rewrite the law, in order to perform acts and enact laws, sometimes unethical and/or illegal, in order to protect the country or themselves and their legacy. Most times, they have noble aims, but their personal philosophies may alter the effort and the outcome.<br />One has to ask themselves the question, as they read, is it really necessary for the average citizen to know what goes on in secret meetings, in back rooms, in foreign countries, or is it more important that the perception remain one of calm and peace throughout the times of trouble and turmoil.<br />What distressed me most about the book was something I have always been a bit naïve about. I always resisted the knowledge that people will often sink to the lowest common denominator, but the book reveals that they sure do. Rather than rise to the occasion, many let petty differences rule their reign, for a period of time. They blame each other unjustly, pervert the truth to get ahead, regardless of whose head rolls, unfairly and unjustly, in the dust. Some, indeed, rose above the fray, but it seems those occasions are few and far between, and that, perhaps, is what is wrong with campaigns and politics in general, and each man, in particular. As I learned in the book, they are, after all, only human, human beings that are invested with the power and pomp of the White House, often for the most foolish of reasons, often without thinking, often by an illiterate electorate. Fortunately, we have gotten it right, most of the time, throughout our history.<br />Regardless of who is seeking power, each blames their predecessor for mistakes made, that they, making promises they cannot possibly keep, do promise to correct. During campaigns, rather than putting the national interest first, politics reigns supreme as does the politics of personal destruction which has become more and more a part of the game in recent years. Sometimes, the real person running is never known or understood until the race is over, so defined are they by others and not themselves. The game of politics is ugly and unfair, and many who play it are even uglier, uglier still because they justify what they do, believing that the ends justified the means.<br />\\"We the people\\" create the narcissists we place in power. If they lose their sense of humility and their arrogance rules as they become narcissists, we have no one but ourselves to blame. It is our blind eyes and deaf ears that allow the travesties to continue and our responsibility to change itby taking an educated interest in the vote, rather than voting only according to habit or party lines.<br />If a candidate can please an ignorant public, he may fail, but they will still love him. The people in power, Congress included, have been doing this for a long time, fooling the public, creating grandiose messages to spin and mislead, so that then, they can accomplish what they originally intended, regardless of whether or not it serves our needs. They create the need, then the play and the scenes. Then they people it with players who carry it out and act as required. They succeed, not based on their qualifications, but on their personalities and their rhetoric, and often on their ability to deceive the masses. We revere the myth, rather than the man, and after a while, who he is fades into the background and we forget who he really is, this man occupying the White House, and we only see the fantasy we, or they, have created.<br />Yes, mistakes have been made by our men of great power, but most, in the end, prove themselves willing and able to become the great men we hoped they would be, learning how to negotiate, compromise and respect their fellow countrymen and the office they occupy. Sometimes, however, the history is written by a media that is not always intent on spreading truth, but rather fiction, to promote their own goals and not the country's.<br />However, long live the Club, for it really does keep the country on a steadier course.<br />The authors did a masterful job of humanizing the former Presidents, while at the same time, elevating them to a status quite above the ordinary citizen by showing the magnitude of the responsibility and the burden of decision weighting every moment of their every day and night.
B00ANIEPE6|5.0|Finally I can make peace with CW after the awful Nikita remake (to my opinion). Oliver is soft spoken when need it, strong when he is supposed to be. Never to cheesy, neither a beggar for attention. Doesn't speak to much, he does what he does best without explaining himself. Almost like batman, but in a slightly a different way.  Casting was done very well, I like it. And he does look the part, (I am wondering how believable he will be if he were just as anorexic as Nikita is lol) even Helena have some anger and twist on her own. Anyway I am very glad and hope this show will keep going, for been a comic book character that may be similar to others the actor is doing a good job.
0374214913|3.0|Tongue in cheek humor pervades this book. The story centers around the eccentric owner of a strange and wonderful bookstore, where books are revered, and also the clerk he hires, Clay Jannon. Clay is out of work, driven into an aimless state of being by a failing economy. One day, while walking, he discovers a job opportunity as the night clerk for Ajax Penumbra's 24-hour bookstore. The shop seems to exist for a dual purpose. On the one hand, it is a bookstore, albeit not one that sells many popular books, or many books at all, for that matter, and on the other hand, it caters to a group of unusual people who are studying odd books in order to discover a very well-kept, hidden secret. The bookstore is reminiscent of a library or a museum. Shelves are filled with ancient manuscripts from floor to ceiling, a ceiling only reached with the aid of a ladder. It is  a temple for books.<br /><br />The secret, that this unusual group of people, seem to be searching for, is a missing code. They must decipher it when they find it. What is this mysterious code? It is the key to eternal life, the key to immortality. In this brief novel, the reader is led on an abstract journey to find the answer. It is often outside reality, and it is often very confusing.<br /><br />This creative little book combines the wisdom of the ages with the creativity of technology to search for the answer. The merry chase is sometimes convoluted and, truth be told, in several places I was completely lost, but soon, the thread is picked up again and the search goes on. In the end, for me, the message of the book was that eternal life, immortality, is the written word, it is what we leave behind as our accomplishments, as well. Time marches on for everyone and so does progress.<br /><br />As the book proudly proclaims: \\"There is no immortality that is not built on friendship and work done with care. ...all secrets worth knowing are hiding in plain sight.\\"
B0068PHS5Q|4.0|As was a bookclub choice, new nothing about the book or Author.  Found it an interesting read, however felt it dragged on a little. Guessed the relationship between brother and sister on estate, but found the twist in the tale quite a surprise.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The book is a little slower than i'd like.  My kids really loved it when they read it, so maybe it's more for kids.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|Should see the first three Bourne stories to enjoy as much as me.  I look forward to Aaron Cross' continuation.

B005FITIGO|2.0|\\"Margin Call\\" (2011) is a role model for making good money (for some, not all) from a low budget quickie movie<br /><br />I gave the movie a \\"2 out of 5\\" rating, which was charitable. Great or even good art, this was not.<br /><br />That stated, the financial venture part of the movie's history (reported in a Wikipedia article about the movie) is worth a close look.<br /><br />The project was cleverly executed, done quickly for a roughly $3 million dollar budget, and made 5 times that much (roughly $16 million dollars) by the time was finished being shown in movie houses.<br /><br />The movie is clever....tricky is also a good word to describe it.<br /><br />It features very famous and skilled actors and was shot in one location mostly in roughly one month (July 2010) in New York City, mostly.<br /><br />The famous actors part of the movie included Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons (both Best Actor Academy Award Winners), Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci.<br /><br />All heavyweights, all actors probably paid a lot of money up front from the $3 Million dollar budget, which otherwise was done on shoestring money remarked on repeatedly and continually by the director, Mr. J. C. Chandor, during the interesting and worth listening to \\"director's commentary\\" special feature part of the movie available in the DVD home version.<br /><br />The project was thrifty in ways movies can be and have been often in the past. This meant six figure figures (maybe large six figure figures) could be paid up front to Spacey, Irons, Moore, and Tucci.<br /><br />Everybody else probably got peanuts and glory, and maybe deferred payment agreements (which when honored were likely good.....those paid in deferred money had roughly $13 million dollars to divide at least part of).<br /><br />What was the result which turned a profit of roughly $13 million dollars for $3 million dollar up front investment?<br /><br />Well........the movie did the \\"Curse Of The Cat People\\" (1943) thing of being a film noir type movie with the \\"unknown monster in the closet\\" dangled through most of the movie ....and dangled skillfully by expert actor danglers (Spacey, Irons, Tucci, Moore).<br /><br />It took advantage of the fact most people don't understand Wall Street and big banker gobble-dee-gook terminology, and presented a corporate crisis meltdown scenario where the reason the corporation of \\"suits\\" faced bad times was never clearly explained....in spite of the (cynical) repeated phrase \\"explain that to me in plain English\\" (never really done) when the \\"what's the problem?\\" question is asked and answered.<br /><br />The audience never has the question answered of why there is \\"trouble in River City with a capital 'T'.\\" \\"MBS's\\" (mortgage based securities) are mentioned in passing, always as an initial-ism.<br /><br />\\"MBS's\\" are reported as the reason Lehman Bros. and Bear Sterns went under in 2008, and Goldman Sachs survived somehow.<br /><br />But not in this movie......the Wikipedia \\"Margin Call Movie\\" article mentions it briefly.<br /><br />People who don't check the Wikipedia description don't learn that.<br /><br />Viewers just learn the company is in trouble and people have to stay up several days and nights in a row facing terrible threats possibly disastrous.<br /><br />These people are all rich (big money incomes are mentioned repeatedly in the script), so they face losing a lot and that is, for dramatic purposes, more tragic than, say, an entire group in a MacDonald's hamburger stand location employees and managers facing loss of income and unemployment.<br /><br />The fact this is the message of the movie is part of the reason why I gave it low grades as a piece of art or valuable script writing.<br /><br />This movie is all about style and technique (delivered well by the big money actors well showcased in the simple film noir show presented), and piggybacking onto the headlines people don't understand about \\"Wall Street In Trouble\\" (esp. the 2008 crisis widely headlined and reported, never explained well anywhere.......every try to read the book titled \\"Too Big To Fail\\" (2010) by Andrew Sorkin about it all?

B00992CF6W|5.0|Fun app. Kids love it! Easy to play and very addictive. Bought it onlinear and took me a while how to figure out how to download it to my kindle :)
B003G4W49C|5.0|By far the best book in a long time that I've read. The biggest plot twist I've ever seen. Great
B004YM6JLO|5.0|So excited to finally be able to sit and watch the next season of Vampire Diaries without commercials.  They are such a nucence!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I thought this book was great, it was hard for me to put down. A heart breaking love story that made me cry, made me angry.  It was hard to pick sides as a mother I found I could relate to both women. I would highly recommend this book.
B00004TS0E|5.0|Saw this on ABC Family and it was the first Miracle on 34th Street, that I actually sat through.  Can't wait to watch it again!
B007MU85D0|4.0|Its a great set of music where all the band members seem to get a shot at their craft and its easy listening like a mini-concert that needs paired with 2 other albums for one of those mini-sets from KBCO that I get to listen to now and then.
B000IDGDPA|4.0|Everything I want in a movie...great characters, costumes, engaging storyline, etc...but--the conclusion was disappointing! I wanted Helen Hunt to reveal her secret of motherhood!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is the best game I have found on the kindle fire their  playstore don't come close to the googleplaystore  yet after continuously searching my daughter and I have finally found some cool games this one tops them all... This game is good for boys and girls of all ages including adults
B009T3AHDE|1.0|Oh my God. Are you kidding me? I'm a huge pattinson fan, bought this movie because of him. Wow! Watching this movie, 109 minutes I will NEVER get back. So dumb! My husband will never let me live this one down
B003L20IFQ|5.0|A man wakes up to find himself buried in a coffin with nothing but a cell phone, lighter and a flask of alcohol. This movie is very suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Recommended highly.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy gaming, and find this fun without requiring too much thought.  Good for end of the day, or just passing time while waiting an appointment, etc.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Sure, it's very reminiscent of Where's My Water, but who cares. It's a fun and challenging game in its own right. I'm halfway through Mission 1, and I've already had to do some serious puzzling over how to complete the levels and keep Agent Perry moving along.<br /><br />Perry has as much character as Swampy, the gator in Where's My Water, with his body language and his snide comments. He doesn't mind letting you know when you're holding him up either.<br /><br />It's a fun (and funny) game for just about all ages.
B0086700CM|4.0|Fun game, also good for mind & reflexes.Trying to beat your previous &#34;best&#34; is addictive!  Try it, you'll like it!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Good but a bit &#34;fluffy&#34; at times, I much preferred his previous effort with Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  Still worth the read and happy with the purchase, will also read part two of the trilogy.
1934030597|5.0|This book payed for itself on day 1; I bought it alongside a new mountain bike and the partially-assembled bike had come with the front disc brake assembly not providing enough clearance for the disc brake (it was rubbing, and no adjustments would prevent it). The book showed an exploded view of the type of disc brake mount that was on my bike, and even helpfully suggested where washers could be inserted for extra clearance. I rummaged some small washers and inserted them into the assembly and now the disc fits with perfect clearance.<br /><br />The book was also good for brake and shifter adjustments, though I am still having trouble getting the front derailleur properly calibrated. The book helped me prevent the bike from shifting the chain off the gears, but so far I still have a slow response to a down-shift.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I saw this in theater--where I NEVER go--and was blown away. Tense, thrilling, often funny but none of this went on and on. Nothing seemed at all overdone. And never overacted. I loved it. Cannot wait for it to come out on instant video to watch it with the rest of my family.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Typical Tim Burton. All my kids enjoyed it (ages 3, 7 & 9). As disturbing as the subject is, the worst part of the movie happened when the child picked up a downed power line. This is kind of irresponsible on the part of the director. Oh well, I guess it's just a movie.
B009346RSS|5.0|I'm new to computer audio, but I enjoy the convenience, flexibility, and potential for near-audiophile sound reproduction it promises.  I simply cannot afford to drop even $350, let alone $2,000, for an external DAC.<br /><br />I purchased the Fiio Taishan D03 and placed it into the following system: iMac running iTunes files through a mini-Toslink to Toslink optical cable to Fiio D03, then RCA cables first to a PAC LC-1 volume control (roughly $14 on Amazon) then from there to KRK Rokit 5's (self-powered, small bookshelf-sized studio monitors) set at half-volume.  Very basic, yet very capable.<br /><br />Result?  Very satisfying sound.  Period.  My iTunes files include much classical, jazz, and ambient electronica music ripped at anywhere from 192 to 256 kbps to Apple lossless, and my ears appreciate a neutral, uncolored presentation.  I haven't allowed for a 50-100 hour burn-in period yet, but after 25-hours or so of continuous playing the Fiio Taishan is producing beautiful music through the KRK's.  I am surprised, relieved, and gratified to have found a low-cost option that lets me hear my digital music files come alive again.<br /><br />Even if it doesn't improve with further burn-in, at this price the Fiio Taishan is a clear-cut no-brainer for anyone with a computer storing music digitally.  If the product lasts, an important void has been filled.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|This was one of the most beautiful, eloquent movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of movies.<br />It was the kind of movie that people could relate to, especially if they have loved another and lost that<br />person through a stupid life decision.  Bridges is the movie that reflects real life and the kind of movie<br />that makes one believe that love -- real honest love -- does really exist.  Like 'An Affair to Remember',<br />Bridges of Madison County is an unforgettable cinema experience --- and not because of the actors.<br />Because of the emotions.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|If you liked GONE GIRL and DARK PLACES, you'll enjoy this lovely demented quick read. Gillian Flynn never fails to surprise with an unexpected twist.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very calming &amp; addicting!  A ton of levels to keep you going.  Nice to have when you need a couple of quiet minutes to rejuvinate.  The art and music are very soothing.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|If you've read any of Neil Gaiman's other novels, you will certainly enjoy this one.  It has a great mix of fantasy and magic, storytelling and character.
B004XZR63M|5.0|It'll teach you and make you understand how the rich stay rich by thinking outside of the box.i highly recommend this book.
0765315246|5.0|You can keep your laser blasters and hyperdrive - With great characters, snappy dialogue, and a compulsively readable style, John Scalzi's 'Old Man's War' is a prime example of what well-written science fiction can do.<br /><br />Mind you, there's plenty of futuristic technology here to grab onto. From starships with instantaneous \\"skip\\" drives to weaponry that tailors itself to the needs of the battle to - well, to say more would be to give away entirely too much. The rest of it, like the story itself, is best found in the discovery of it. There's moments when the science is thin, but I didn't care because Scalzi kept me wanting to find out what happens next.<br /><br />This story of an old man, his wife passed on and he himself fast approaching the end of his useful life, had me hooked right from the first pages. The emotional core of it is entirely believable from the first pages, and the smart, sarcastic tone was immensely fun to read. As we learn of his plans to serve as a soldier, and find out just what that means for him and those who've volunteered with him, the pages just turn faster and faster, leading to a satisfying and well-crafted ending.<br /><br />I'll be honest - 'Old Man's War' sat on my shelf for many months, perhaps as much as a year, before I picked it up to read it. Once I did, I finished it in just over two days, completing the last half in a single sitting. And now that I've read it, I'm hungry for more!<br /><br />Good thing for me that there's several more books in the series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicolas Sparks captivates you in Safe Haven. Once you start reading it is extremely hard to put down. Definitely a must buy!
B008C40218|3.0|The music is good, but the life has been sucked out of it in the studio. The quality is not as good as it was back in the 90's and early 2000's.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this book it was so amazing!<br /> I liked it because it really gave good detail on how she was feeling and what she was going through.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|For my android 10.1 inch tablet.  The pages are so bright it hurts to read.  I can't adjust the font size.  I can't create or view highlights or bookmarks.  I hope they make an update that fixes the missing functionality.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One is a awesome book to read if you love video games, the 80's, and American pop culture. Over all a great book. Must have it on your must read list.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I didn't like how the author writes. Otherwise I wanted to read this book for a challenge. I am going to keep reading this a little at a time for a challenge.
B00A2BTCM4|4.0|I have bought two copies of this and so far, I can't get the DVD out without it<br />cracking from the center outward. With that said, the second copy will play and<br />I am giving a listen before it goes back for a THIRD attempt. Anyone else?<br />The surround mix is pretty awesome from my seat.<br />I'm still waiting for the exchange method to be announced for Thick As A Brick Surround, Amazon ?
B007EECSFA|4.0|Another good read.  Seemed slow at first,I didn't get into it as fast as other books by Kate Morton but by the half way point I was hooked.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love the Harry Bosch stories and so does my husband.  We've read them all and this one is another winner.  Connelly does his homework with all of his novels, so they are factual, but he doesn't overdo it with facts and figures.  It's an easy read, so I hate when I'm coming to the end because there isn't any more.  Maybe I'll go back to the beginning and read all the Harry Bosch stories over again!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Got this for my wife's Kindle Fire HD 7\\" and she loves it! It works wonderfully. And she loves the strap that holds it together, as well as the fact that as you open it, it wakes the Kindle, and puts it to sleep when you close it. Definitely a good case and would totally recommend it to anyone considering a case for their Kindle.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I just love the range of information that this app provides. It may take just bit of time to learn all the information that is available and get it set up the way you like it, but it is well worth it for this hands down best app, specially for a weather junkie like me!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Let me start off by saying I love diary of a wimpy kid because of it's LOL moments and good natured humor. To me this book did not measure up to the books before it, and lacked the  quality the other books possessed. The first 40 pages were pretty good even though they had almost nothing to do with the story line. Then the book went on to describe Greg's hard time finding a date to the school dance. Finally the book ended in an incomplete way .When arriving at the acknowledgments I thought I might have skipped several pages to the ending. All together the book felt incomplete and as if Kinney had written the book just to write another book and not to satisfy his readers.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is a wonderful app to provide BBC news and articles in an easy to use mobile format. The presentation of infomation allows easy selection of specific areas of interest, from world news to sports, from China to the USA, you will find the infomation you are looking for, including audio and video formats. Five star mobile app!
B0070QSP5O|5.0|I listen to Old Ideas when its dark and I am in the need of someone who is dealing with reality and finding it difficult. Cohen is older than me, writes better than me, and still on the road. He brings great poetry, surprisingly great backup sounds, that is now as good as his words, and his voice that rings of deep emotion. I can't ask for anything more. Well a ticket to the next concert would work.
B004DM0UII|2.0|Not a very bad app, but not the best. I recommend TuneIn app which has better function to find local stations, (the TuneIn app made this easy). This app did not have as comprehensive catagory functions. Display of radio stations did not always display the station's logo, which makes quick selection more of a chllenge. I did not pay for this app, I got it with the free app of the day from Amazon, I would not pay for it, there are better apps such as TuneIn to go with.
0979019710|5.0|Hal does nothing but add value to your life. As a previous coaching client of his, you will have to try hard to find someone who adds as much selfless value to your life. I love both of this books, and this Miracle Morning has changed my life.<br /><br />This book is worth every penny.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have now used this utility with my Kindle Fire 8.9 for about to weeks and can highly recommend its uefullnes. It provides a wide range of battery information including both estimates on the time it will need to recharge by the Kindle rapild charger or by USB and battery drain estimates depending on a wide variety of activities. Five star app!
B009LY72LQ|4.0|We love making the monsters but with only one wig and two bodies in the set, one of our girls is perpetually bald.  Cannot evel order hair anywhere.  Otherwise it is great fun.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love this app! Its feature to search for local stations made finding these stations easy, better app than the XiiaLive Pro I tried. Its seach engine found \\"Celtic\\" stations that were missed by the XiiaLive Pro app.  I found that the layout was very easy to learn and use. The listings of stations also displays the logos of the stations, making selection from a list easier. The information as to what music is playiing is boldly displayed. Five star rating!
B006O6F932|5.0|Monster high School continues with the creative detail that make this series of toys so popular.  The set is large yet folds up into a nice sized package for storage or travel.  It has lots of small accessories, books, a three eyed frog, laboratory glassware, desks, cafeteria tables, casketball court and lots more.  Our daughter dove into it on Christmas morning and hasn't stopped playing with it yet.
B005FITIGO|4.0|This movie shows you what goes on behind the scenes of your stock brokerage that tries to sell you junk securities. They get paid millions of dollars for you to buy junk from them. \\"Margin Call\\" gives a glimpse of one such firm that unloaded junk securities and contributed to the current global financial crisis. It's \\"just business\\" to them, but it's seeing red in our own financial portfolios that they handle.<br /><br />BTW, my securities with PIMCO fund house are still in the red after more than 3 years! WHY are they paying their fund managers millions of dollars while investors are being taken for the ride? Lesson to learn: I now know that the best way to handle our own financial future is self-education and trading our own self-directed accounts. To Hell with all those sleezy fund houses and fund managers! They all appear nice on brochures, but are no better than CORRUPT politicians!

B00000I3JO|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time.... especially of my early 20's. So many good and bittersweet memories come flooding over me when I listen to this beautiful CD. Timeless.
0143117009|1.0|This is a superb book, but there is no excuse for the Kindle version to cost more than the paperback edition.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is as good as the leading brand. My brother in law had a canon bag exactly like this and I compared them. The only difference is some side pockets he had that I didn't. I won't use them cause there is enough storage inside. I love this bag exactly what I want and less expensive.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I bought this mainly because i liked the minigame in World of Warcraft that mimics it.  It was fun and challenging, but once you get through the adventure (took me 2 nights) it basically becomes useless.  The other versions of the game have modes that let you keep playing, and the cash you make becomes worth while cause you can actually buy and use the store stuff against new and harder challenges.  Not so with this version.  The 'minigames' are just redos of the stuff from the adventure mode. Fun but not really worth 3 bucks, there are other free games with more longevity than this.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I love the whole album, it is lovely and fun at the  same time. florence and the machine  are a great group.
1400031524|5.0|For those true lovers of a great book, and those interested in murder mysteries, this book is for you.  A Swedish detective, with complicated relationships, and a World closing in on itself, he is able to see and solve problems others cannot.  The interplay between his great police work and his personal life falling part creates a wonderfully rich backstory.  Mostly set in Latvia, this book involves multiple murders , personal relationships, and intrigue.  I recommend this book highly.
B007F39498|5.0|I'm a Springsteen fan, but this cd is exceptional and not  the normal fare. It is a commentary on today's America and I think he hit the nail on the head
B005LAII80|5.0|Movie - 5.0<br /><br />I don't remember much about 1995's Judge Dredd. I did like it, but probably more for the dark and dreary futuristic sci-fi atmosphere it had and the fact that it starred Stallone rather than anything else. I remember Diane Lane, Armand Assante, Max Von Sydow, and even Rob Schneider (*bleh*). I remember those kick-ass Lawgivers, some really cool set pieces (a prison out in the middle of a desert, I think), and that's about it. Needless to say, I was just a kid back then and my cinematic sensibilities have grown a lot since that time, which brings us to this reboot. The world has irradiated itself from nuclear war. The earth is all but a barren wasteland, with its remaining inhabitants crowded into Mega-Cities. Mega-City One's population is 800 million, with its territory stretching from Boston to Washington D.C. Amongst the crowded chaos stands one force to bring order; a force that serves as jury, executioner, and Judge. On a day when Dredd (Karl Urban) is assigned rookie, Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), for assessment, they would get more than they bargained for on her first day. In response to an initial homicide call at the city block of Peach Trees, they also discover a drug ring run by a woman called Ma-Ma (Lena Heady). But she won't have the Judges taking one of her men into custody. And in an attempt to thwart them, she seals the block's blast doors, leaving the Judges to fend for themselves as they battle to survive.<br /><br />Since the old Dredd, I've discovered a lot of interesting titles that make this movie the bleak and desolate sci-fi actioner that it is. Not that I'm saying any of these films are directly responsible for what you see here, but I like to think they helped contribute. These movies are: Blade Runner, Training Day, V for Vendetta, and Punisher: War Zone. This new Dredd takes some of the dystopian elements of Blade Runner, not so much the sense of prowess and ingenuity for its time, but similarly in that the future is a dirty, grimy, and post-Apocalyptic one. The Training Day reference is seen in how Dredd teaches Anderson to make her own judgement calls, how those decisions can turn out (for better or worse), and ultimately ponders the morality of what can and can't be done within the legal system. The Punisher: War Zone similarity comes in the excessive style and mentality of the hyper-violence. Here, you have Dredd working on the side of the law. But the law, in fact, allows him to brandish his own (bloody) justice based on their rules and his own judgement, much like the Punisher does as a vigilante, only the Punisher worked outside of the law. Then, there's V for Vendetta which, for the most part, was about anarchy (or anarchy in the sense of \\"freedom,\\" if you go by the movie). Where V fought to break out of authority, I see Dredd as the exact opposite in that he fights to achieve it. As lawless and degenerate as the world of Dredd is, I'm fascinated by this contrasting view that manages to tell all of these things in 90 minutes of action-packed goodness. And because of that, I now regard this as one of my all-time favorite films.<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />- Codec: MPEG-4 MVC<br />- Resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Dredd was shot using 3 kinds of digital cameras: the Phantom Flex, which shoots at a rate of over 3,000 frames per second capturing every little detail for slow-moving, jaw-dropping clarity, as seen from all the obvious effects in the Slo-Mo sequences; the Red One MX, which captures images at 4.5K resolution and is currently the highest-quality camera of its class at the moment; and the Silicon Imaging SI-2K, a favorite of DP (director of photography), Anthony Dod Mantle, that shoots at a native resolution of 2K and was used in collaboration for both of Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours (of which the first won an Oscar for its cinematography). Case in point: they shot this movie using some pretty top-notch cameras, and it definitely makes a difference. Not to mention, with such a masterful and skilled DP like Mantle working on, frankly, the most popular comic book franchise to ever come out of England, a visual feast is to be expected. The result was an excellent 2D image. But the fact that this was shot in 3D is what makes the film even more of a unique experience.<br /><br />I saw Dredd in theaters twice, of which both viewings were in 3D. So seeing it at home on BD is actually my first time ever seeing it in 2D. That being said, the 2D presentation is near-perfect. The beauty of Dredd being shot with all these cameras means that the negative format is completely digital, so transferring it to BD was a cinch. Clarity is spectacular showing all the little lines and details in the sets, props, costumes, and texturing. Dredd's face (at least what's shown of it) and all the Judges uniforms look razor-sharp. In particular, I really like how you can see the stubble on Dredd's face and the lines above his lips with that signature scowl. The black levels give the film a very gritty feel and and balance perfectly with the contrast to show just enough detail within the frame, but also withholds enough to give the movie a kind of edginess. The color scheme is very monochromatic, though I'd say it helps create the bleak, desolate atmosphere that Dredd is supposed to be. It consists mostly of dark reds, blacks, dingy greys, and mustard greens, but I like the effect it gives the story. Alternatively, the colors become very exaggerated during the Slo-Mo sequences, where the crew wanted to create a surreal, almost artistic, sense of depth in conjunction to what the the drug is actually supposed to do to your brain. On the downside, since the movie was shot in Stereo (Stereoscopic 3D), it gives way for some video anomalies: the non-Red One MX-shots have a little bit of digital noise in them, colors and detail seem a bit off in some shots, and the obvious 3D effects simply don't register on a 2D viewing plane. So if you can, I highly recommend you watch this in 3D by default.<br /><br />3D - 5.0<br /><br />And now to the good stuff. Lately, I've been going through and sampling a lot of 3D movies to compare depth, pop, and overall effectiveness just to see how one 3D movie can differ from another. Most of the 3D movies I own were shot in native 3D, with I think, The Avengers being being the one lone converted-3D title I tried out with the rest. And after lots of sampling, I've come to the conclusion that for all the excuses I hear for 3D merely being a \\"gimmick,\\" it ultimately comes down to artistic creativity and how the director and production crew decide to present their movie. In the case of Dredd, after watching the special feature on the movie's visual effects, I have to say I commend the approach Mantle took with his first-ever attempt at filming in 3D. The world of Dredd is a confined one. The world was blown to hell, and what remaining 800 million people there are have to bundle into one Mega-City that only stretches so far along the Eastern Seaboard. Knowing this, Mantle purposely utilizes the effect of closeups to help accentuate the nature of this confinement and isolation. I feel this gives the film an extra sense of depth just by itself and that it does a great job creating separation between the fore-, middle-, and background.<br /><br />As for the more commonplace 3D elements (i.e. the \\"pop\\" effect). The film takes advantage of this mostly during the Slo-Mo sequences. Smoke floating, bullets flying, and blood, glass, and water splattering, shattering, or splashing look especially breath-taking when combining the frame rate of the Phantom Flex, the exaggerated color scheme, and the layering of 3D to create a true thing of beauty in an otherwise \\"ugly\\" world of a story. This particular visual aspect adds a whole new dimension to the storytelling, and provides a great counterpoint to the hyper-violence rampant throughout. Coincidentally, all the digital noise and off-color anomalies that are present in the 2D version are pretty much absent in 3D. And I have to say that in comparison to what I saw in theaters (which used a Sony 4K projector), seeing this on an LED flat-panel screen looks even better. The brightness of the LED lighting makes a huge difference in detail, which I'm willing to sacrifice a little size and blacks for, so definitely give this a chance in a home theater setup if you thought the video was a little too murky back in the cinemas.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1, Neo:X<br />- English: Dolby Digital 2.0<br />- Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />-  English, English SDH, Spanish<br /><br />Being an action movie on top of everything else, Dredd has a remarkably aggressive audio design that really puts the viewer in a bubble of sound throughout its entire duration. While guns firing, bullets ricocheting, and structures crumbling make up the forefront of this chaotic mix, it's Paul Leonard-Morgan's pulsating electronic score that really enhances the mood. Much like Hans Zimmer's work for the action sequences in The Dark Knight, the score acts as a sound effect in itself to help give the film a unique sound. In the case of Dredd, I feel the music gives it a sort of \\"driving force\\" that can double as either a representation of Dredd, the character, or the kind of world he's living in and trying to defend. The rhythm of these pieces, in turn, end up making a good portion of the movie fly by before you know it. But of course, as a fan of action movies I won't deny the bad-assery of all the shooting, explosions, and blood splattering all over the place either. In terms of pure immersive audio, you couldn't ask for anything better.<br /><br />As for the actual quality of sound from the speakers, it's perfect. Dialogue is at a very clear and discernible level that not only emanates from the center, but occasionally through the front, side, and rear channels as well. Dynamic range is stellar from the piercing sound of bullets to the low end of the music making for a sonic treat. Separation offers up some pretty intense moments when the Judges are having shootouts with stuff blowing up from this and that speaker and the music resonating through or along with it from the others. Side and rear channels have excellent directionality dividing proper placement of effects such as bullets flying from one side of the screen to the other, crowds of people scrambling to safety, or vehicles driving across the road. And last, but not least, are the LFEs (low frequency effects). Bass is pounding from the constant rhythm of the score and the frequent discharge of the Lawgivers, with an even more boisterous display of this when Ma-Ma and her gang are shooting up a floor with motorized .50-caliber Gatlings. This is definitely a reference track for showing off your home theater setups.<br /><br />Extras - 2.5<br /><br />- Mega-City Masters: 35 Years of Judge Dredd (HD; 14:27)<br />A brief, but very detailed overview of Judge Dredd since his first appearance in Britain's weekly comic book publication, 2000 A.D. The creators and various other writers/artists talk about Dredd's origins (much of the influence coming from Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry), the symbolism and representation of his character (a stranglehold on order, justice, and authority), and get into particular detail about his design and how they wanted it to be simple, yet macho enough to be the complete embodiment of the law (his helmet mimicking a medieval executioner's mask, with the eagle on his shoulder representing America, or in some cases, fascism). They also discuss Dredd's rise in popularity over the tenure of his existence and how the character itself became an icon amongst British comic book lore. In addition, they also discuss the general worldview of Dredd, the various characters and scenarios he faced, and the different types of stories written over the years (i.e. satires, metaphors, etc.). I honestly wish this segment were double the length, as I'm really interested in learning more about the franchise, now.<br /><br />- Day of Chaos: The Visual Effects of Dredd (HD; 15:21)<br />This segment talks mainly about the production design of the movie and the specific style of 3D they wanted to shoot. Initially, all the art and production crew had to work with was a storyboard script (that coincidentally looked like a comic book itself), but still managed to achieve the look and vision that was asked for by using a lot of practical shots throughout South Africa and incorporating sprinkles of CG to make it look like the dirty, grimy, yet massive set piece that is Mega-City One. The inside of Peach Trees was constructed to scale as a set, but only had 3 floors and a quarter of the actual coverage, which they later redressed for different shots and angles. Meanwhile, the 3D aspect was something the crew wanted to do a little differently than most other 3D films. Here, they had more so an intention of creating a surrealist perception of Dredd's world using lots of closeup shots, the occasional Slo-Mo sequence, and other effects to give the viewer a more \\"wondrous\\" feel, as opposed to the gimmicky \\"pop\\" most other films have become acclimated to producing. It's a damn shame this and the first segment were all they could afford to make in terms of extras, as I feel there's a lot more work that went into the actual movie that we'll never get to learn about.<br /><br />- Dredd Featurette (HD; 1:53)<br />A promotional piece that gives a very basic overview of the film's setting and plot. And it's not even as intriguing as the theatrical trailer. I would say it feels more like those promos they play in the theater like a commercial before the lights go out and the actual trailers even start.<br /><br />- Dredd's Gear (HD; 2:31)<br />Again, too brief of a segment that talks about Dredd's police gear, Lawgiver gun, and motor bike.<br /><br />- The 3rd Dimension (HD; 2:00)<br />Some quick tidbits about shooting in 3D. Most of it is rehash from the Visual Effects segment.<br /><br />- Welcome to Peachtrees (HD; 2:33)<br />Talks about how the production crew wanted use the entire city block set as a \\"character\\" in the movie.<br /><br />- Dredd Motion Comic Prequel (HD: 2:57)<br />Gives a little background info on Ma-Ma and the man that created Slo-Mo.<br /><br />- Theatrical Trailer (HD; 2:30)<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />I didn't even know they were doing this remake, let alone how awesome it would be. Dredd is a visually stunning and thoroughly engaging sci-fi actioner with a lot of subtle influences that I feel make it a perfect setup for the world of Judge Dredd. And as well-received as it was by fans and critics alike, it sadly has yet to break even of its production budget to show any kind of profitability. But if you've seen this movie based on a recommendation (mine or someone else's) and like it, do me the favor of spreading the word to anyone you think would like this and try to help the home video sales for a possible sequel. In fact, it's rumored that screenwriter Alex Garland wants to make this a trilogy which, given how great this first installment is, would be a sight to behold. The video specs are excellent in 2D. But the fact of the matter is that you should see this in 3D at least once in your life. Meanwhile, the audio will definitely rock your theater room, so be careful not to disturb anyone if you're watching this late at night. And it's a shame the special features couldn't include more content (like an audio commentary). But hopefully enough word will get out, people will buy this, and we'll see that trilogy yet!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Love, love, love Michael Buble.  Very glad that he did a holiday themed CD.  Hope more will come in the future.
B00AJV4G28|5.0|Buddy is the best blues player alive. He has been an inspiration to the Stones and Clapton and he is now getting inspiration from them. The album has fantastic guitar work!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rated high - I love Christmas music and Rod Stewart is an excellent addition to the season.  I always look forward to anything he does.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. it is a lot of fun. its not too easy and not super hard. I would definitely recc<br />recommend it to my friends.
B0049GYXGI|4.0|Bought this for my daughter after having 2.  The first one is always the best!  Yo Quiero Taco Bell!  I just hope they don't come out with part 4.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My older daughter was so excited and surprised to recieve this as a gift. She had no idea that I got that for her.
1419705849|5.0|i bought this as a christmas present for my son to add to his collection. it was the cheapest price among the stores and online!
B007XHWROK|5.0|Aww yes The Biebs. What more can I say.  I have to admit even as a 47yr. old grown woman and a grandmother of 5 I like his music.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great for organizing different categories especially if you're taking classes or if you just like being organized. It's like a notebook on the go with the added bonus of recording audio which is great for lectures.  I also like how you can access your notes from any device that has this app installed.
B003Y5H5B0|3.0|This movie is watchable, but not a must watch.  So much potential.  No character development or relationship development.  Story is good, but done before.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I think this game was very fun with great graphics.  I did get stuck towards the end but finally figuring out what to do made it that much more fun for me.  I played it without a glitch on my Acer Iconia A500.  I've also had it since the first time it was the faotd.  I don't know if an update that is causing everyone's issue with fc or if it's a compatibility issue w some devices.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|This is a great addition to the Twilight series.  Can't wait to see Part 2.  Amazing chemistry between the characters.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A superb follw-on to Fall of Giants.  It kept a great continuity throughout the book and I can't wait for the next one.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|My grandson has a lot of legos and will be able to use this to take some of them with him when he goes places.
B00005JKNC|5.0|You simply cannot go wrong with Jim Carrey. This is a more serious effort on Jim's part and he does an excellent job of playing a man in love in this movie. Its one of my favorite movies and my son and husband like it as well. It is a bit of a tear jerker however. The movie comes in a convenient snap case as well.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is totally a rip off of Twilight, the author used to write fanfics about Twilight in fact. But with that being said it's still pretty hot, especially if you are a Twilight fan, just read the names as Edward and Bella, lol!!! There are some pretty cheesy moments that at times ruined the moment and it could turn pretty childish, but all in all I enjoined the book, it even sparked a few fun times with my hubby, lol!!!
B005LAIIQC|2.0|I bought the movie for my husband and I did not watch it myself.  He said that if he hadn't previously read the book, he would not have understood the movie at all.
B002VWNICW|5.0|Love this movie. I've seen several versions of this book, but this is far and away my favorite. Great cast, can't help but to fall in love with then all!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|It's good but I didn't get the update anyone know y? So if anyone has any ideas just post here I use kindle fire so maybe that's it
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Read it in 3 days!  So many twists it keeps you wanting to read more.  The ending was the only thing I was mad at.... totally unexpected!  An awesome read!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This game was supposed to be free but it constantly runs out of coins and then requires you to wait 30 seconds before it gives you one lousy coin. Says it's free but if you want more coins you have to pay for them. FREE MEANS FREE. RIPOFF!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Super awesome book! Couldn't put it down, it was so engrossing. I read the whole series over Xmas break last year!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It was one of my wife's favorite Christmas presents. I am sure she will other sets when they become available.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book is a page turner from the very start...I love Vince Flynn and have read everything he has written.<br /><br />Great read
B005IQZB14|2.0|I didn't find the writing that good on a subject that should have been fairly riveting.  And unfortunately I grew to dislike the author by the end of the book.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|If you like these authors, Diana Gabaldon, Stephanie Meyer, and J.K. Rowling, you will love this book! I've read it twice and I can see it is one of those books I could read repeatedly.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|It was very slow in places; some of the material was trite.  I just don't think the characters had enough depth.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing... a must read!  Suspense was good and wasn't predictable.<br />I wanted to read more and more and more!!! You have to read this!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|fun but laggy<br />the game has such great graphics that the kindle fire has trouble keeping up with the game. but it is very fun.
1569242739|3.0|The recipes are very extensive. Products you can't just get at the regular store. Very time consuming. The pic's are pretty and it's written well and tons of tips. You need to read and follow all the tips or you might as well not make the recipe.<br /><br />It shipped quick. I recommend the seller.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|It is, what it is. It will never be on a reading list with the Gold Coast, and that's because it doesn't belong there. However, if you're looking for a \\"John McClane\\" character, intelligently written by the author of the Gold Coast, you're in for one hell of a ride.
1592332803|5.0|I absolutely love this book. So easy to make Delicious recipes. My Favorite Baklava. WOW! To die for. I accidentally bought the wrong pastry sheets and it still came out delicious. Was actually easier with the thicker sheets instead of the puff thin sheets. This was a big hit at Christmas.<br /><br />The chocolate chip cookie recipe is exactly the one I have used for years with Vegan products instead.<br /><br />This book is easy, nice pics. You can get the ingredients easy. I love this book! I highly recommend it!<br /><br />It shipped quick. I recommend the seller!
B001HZK8FY|5.0|I was looking forward to the movie. Had seen it before and really like it. Am glad it's in my library now.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|premise unbelievable, plot discombulated.  Bruce Willis must have owed the producers a favor.  Should have done my due diligence before ordering
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I personally  did not like it. I actually could not finish it. It was over the top with language and filth. I Dont consider myself a prude but sometimes movies are just more about filth then the point of the story. This movie was stupid!!! Now I will admit I laughed a few times but over all STUPID.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|At first I would see a handful of posts, and then another handful listed underneath in shaded boxes that you can't access.  Now I don't have the boxes anymore, but it only lets me scroll down so far and stops.  So if you want to access something beyond that, you can't.  Very limited.  Pretty useless unless you're only interested in the past few days.  I'm beginning to think the devs don't care about fixing it either.  Save yourself the trouble and just access Facebook through your browser.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|TRON is a great movie and the new story is great too. It moves fast so if you aren't paying attention you're probably going to miss something vital.
B000YIGNHC|5.0|Great movies and with both on one DVD - great movies both of them - highly recommended for all animal lovers
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book is number two of the kingkiller chronicles and if you read the first one then you need to read this one. Fantastic book and I can't wait for number three.
B008P76UKE|5.0|This is a very well recorded and filmed production of a very well arranged piece of music that includes prominent sections from Wagner's Ring Cycle.  The price was right as well.
B00356CO1E|5.0|After returning to work following the birth of my daughter, I had a couple of pretty sedentary weeks because it was really hard to find the time to exercise.  This video is a great solution.  I can do it after putting the baby to bed or sometimes even while she plays nearby.  I have been doing the first level.  I find the cardio and abs easy but the strength moves very challenging, probably because I did a lot of jogging during my first few months post-partum, but even with the not-too-tough cardio I do get a decent sweat going.  I'm interested to see if the cardio/ab circuits get much harder in levels 2 and 3, which would really make this an amazing workout.  Even level 1 is an awesome workout when combined with a short run first.  I like how straightforward the video is.  You hardly need any equipment (you could use 16 oz cans for weights in a pinch) and Jillian's technique cues are helpful.  There's no wondering if you're on the wrong foot or feeling like an idiot because the moves are too complex.  I'm so glad to have this option available for really busy days and I am looking forward to checking out some of Jillian's other videos.
0765325950|5.0|It's an intense and action packed read, a worthy ending to such an impressive and enjoyable series.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the negative reviews.  That a lack of an ebook is causing so many to act like spoiled children is a testament to Jordan's (and Sanderson) work, and how loved and important this book, and the series itself, is to its fans.
B00908DDZM|5.0|this was greatly  appreciated by my granddaughter . it was a christmas gift to her . i don't listen to her kind of music .
1452110581|5.0|naturally cat lovers will love this little book - however, I think those who are not captivated by the little darlings will also find humor and perhaps a change of heart?
1449410243|4.0|I think it is a really cute book for adult cat lovers and due to cost makes a great inexpensive gift.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|The Polar Express was a Great movie.  My grandchildren and I enjoyed it very much.  Wish there could be more movie like this one for the chrildren.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Better than the movie can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. Top 5 book I have ever read
B005HSL626|1.0|every segment brought up an ad for mastercard or a survey. couldn't play for all the pop-ups. not good for kids.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What can I say its everyone medium for staying in touch so glad Kindle has this feature or it wouln'd be useful to me...thanks!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this app is awesome. first time I used the app it turned out awesome.I love the app so will you.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|to keep in touch with old friends New friends and family. I love the pictures and info you can get on fb. it's also fun!
B00A31UXLW|3.0|An easy read and easy to pick up and put down.  I read it for the Xmas and New Year break and it 'filled the gap'.  Harry Bosch is an easy character to like and it is &#34;classic Bosch&#34;.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|it's fast, easy, cheaper, you save time, gas, money, and choices are much bigger on eBay no running around to the stores.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|If you have read the preceding two books, this one ties the story together and brings it closer to recent history.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|it's something to do while you are waiting for time to go by. it's also addicting. I do this cause it's winter.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is so fun when you have nothing to do some things are more challenging than others but if there was no challenge it wouldn't be fun. but it is.
B00884GR0W|4.0|There are a lot of random bad reviews but I like the game!! I bought minecraft pocket edition a while back, but all in all, this game was better.<br />Minecraft pocket edition has all of the ease and smoothness of original minecraft, but has a cruddy texture that makes it look like a really old beta version. The map is way small which limits creativity.<br />Block story has great graphics. The controls could be improved... (also notice of their four control schemes two are joystick) but there are lots more creatures, including other humans. Another problem I see is its hard to get certain resources and there is no creative mode.<br />I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder.. but I find that this game stands out more for its great graphics, endless map and price.
B007704HO6|3.0|I love cats, especially orange male cats as I have two so I enjoyed reading about Bob.  I wish we could have learned a little more about the author
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so good. The Games are so good. If you have not ever read it, I suggest you should.  It is so much better than the movie. The movie terrible compared to this book. This book is so good I had to invent a new word it is EPICNESS.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This game reminds me of the old days when pac man was a very popular game.  It has taken some time for me to get use to playing it again but it is still fun.
1451627297|5.0|I do not ordinarily feel the need to review Stephen King books, nor do I customarily get around to reading them until they hit the remaindered tables a couple of years after being published, but when 11/22/63 came out I knew I had to read it right away.  As with most Americans of a certain age I have vivid memories of November 22, 1963 (I was six, by the way)and the terrible days that followed President Kennedy's assassination.  Before, during and now after  my career as a high school history teacher I frequently fantasized about a time machine, a  way to return to the past to observe and perhaps change pivotal events.  I've read a number of wonderful books about time travel, and I have to rate King's newest effort among the best of them.<br /><br />Jake is a high school English teacher in Maine in 2011.  Essentially rootless and feeling adrift, he learns of and is deeply touched by stories of old tragedies affecting people he knows.  Then he meets Al, a man with a secret: access to 1958 through a wormhole or bubble.  He makes a few trips back into time, eventually making efforts to prevent some of the local tragedies with which he is familiar.  Then Al assigns him another task: return to 1958 and spend the next five years working to prevent JFK's assassination.  Jake accepts the challenge, but he finds unexpected twists and turns that complicate an already difficult job.<br /><br />King's depictions of the modern world and that of the late 50s and early 60s are fascinating and colorful.  The suspense is never ending and immeasurably enhanced by the vast amount of research he undertook to ensure historical accuracy.  I was riveted all the way through and intend to reread this many times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 10 year old and my 7 year old play this. Each on their own kindle. For the first time they play together online and don't argue!
B001NEXEEG|5.0|One of my favorite films with two of my favorite actors, Stewart and Wayne. Supporting cast is outstanding with Marvin, Devine, Miles, Carradine etc....
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Installed and played this game for a few days before realizing that even after exiting the game it continues to run in the background. Tried manually closing the game from the settings menu on my Kindle Fire, however, the game continued to run. Had to uninstall, as it drained my battery. It was a cute, fun game, but not for me.
B0078Q2HAA|1.0|Right out of the gate, I want to know:  what was the motivation for the making of this film?  Was it so that Meryl Streep could be up for another Oscar, or perhaps so that the Hollywood left could take a swipe -- OK, way more than one -- at somebody on the right?<br /><br />I have to admit, I'm not completely knowledgeable about the life of Margaret Thatcher, not even after watching this jumbled sorry mess of a film.  The narrative is told through a series of flashbacks, where those flashbacks involve the aged Ms. Thatcher reminiscing about her life, at least as well as she's able.  Evidently, she has Alzheimers -- I'm not sure of this and I won't even research it -- because that's at least how they portray her here.  But I have to ask the following:  if Ms. Thatcher was a liberal, wouldn't the filmmakers have been much more kind to her legacy?  Was it OK to treat her so poorly because she was a conservative?  And most importantly, what does her family think of this film?  (My guess:  they detest it.)<br /><br />But the bigger issue:  why didn't they just stick with a standard linear narrative here, perhaps modified by starting at the end of her life -- briefly -- then going back to the beginning when she was a child and working their way forward?  It would then surely have been easier to follow, as I became confused myself at points who was even real and who was imagined.  I feel that, in order to watch this film at all, one nearly needs to be a near-expert on the former prime minister's life.<br /><br />I am a big Meryl Streep fan, but she had no chance of saving this disaster.  And I'm actually a little perturbed that she even tried. In my opinion, she should have politely declined this slamfest and done another project.  A big pass on this one from me.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book is terrible. It is boring, it is not well written (from a reader's point of view. Not worth 2.99
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have read all the books. I have wanted to watch the series but I don't have cable or dish. I bought the first and second season. I've watched the complete first season so far. I really enjoyed I it follows the books pretty well. I can't wait to watch the second season.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love Lee Child's books, especially the Reacher books.  I liked this one too.  I don't know if it was because I was in the middle of moving, but this book read a bit slower than his others.  Still loved it though!  I would recommend this to my friends.
0670026603|5.0|throw away your shades of gray books and read about a real romance- one where individuals ultimately valued each others' wishes and allowed the other party to grow. I began reading with much trepidation, but quickly learned to love the quirky characters of Lou and Will. This is a life affirming book. You will feel better after reading it.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|i love collecting movies and thought i would add this one to my collection and this is one of my favorite jodi foster movies.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|started playing at 8pm, still playing at 2.  Not difficult to learn, just keep going forward at start (any number) till help comes up, scroll down.  so lifelike, I would gladly recommend this game to any one.  great for the brain.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I'll admit that I got this 2 season series strictly for James Purefoy, and he is superb in it, but it was other characters that caught my attention immediately and kept it. Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson were sublime in this. I've been a fan of Kevin McKidd for quite a bit now but Ray Stevenson was a revelation. I think the writing was brilliant and the acting was fantastic and it more than kept my attention throughout. I was very upset when I finished the series and plan on re-watching it very soon. Absolutely brilliant show. Plus the price here at Amazon.com is spot on, everywhere else in the stores that I've seen this at the price for this version is over 80 dollars! This isn't so much for the younger amongst us though, there's full frontal nudity of both male and female characters and vivid sex scenes and it's very violent but that's how things were back then I guess, violent. Still that shouldn't make you skip this series, it's absolutely magnificent.
B0063IH60K|4.0|enjoy it during idle time.  easy to navigate.  has a variety of ways to play.  would recommend it to others
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really great game! Finally downloaded it and can't wait for the second one to come out! Graphics were amazing and the plot had me jumping in my seat lol. Nicely done :)
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|1st key for cupboard is in the book on desk, 2nd page on level 2...... got stuck and almost quit, hint was not helping, daughter was smart enough to find it!  good graphics and stoty line, fun to play just a little to short for $3!!  and cant figure out how to get to bonus levels to take down the evil carnival??  would love help!!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Great special effects and nicely modernized. This movie can stand on its own but also complements the original very well.
B002E2QHBS|5.0|Greetings and Welcome Home to All<br />  I am a Vietnam Vet so missed the good times on the ground here in the States during this period but this is got to be the next best thing to being there<br />,<br />  The 6 CD's not only brought me songs I had never heard before but the narrative from the Producers was in this set.<br /> It was like being on the good Farmers land on those 3 days.....<br /><br />The first thing I can say is buy it..............Now............It will not be long and they will be gone and you will miss a great piece of of American History.......<br /><br />These recordings are just cool as hell. The Music was recorded clean and consise and bad to the bone.

B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Only problem that I have with game is that it is a bit hard to see some of the stuff.  I have to change screen size a lot and use hints more than I would like.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|I have every book Mr Levin has written. I Love all of them. He is a timeless favorite of a large fan base.  This mystery is not what happened but what will happen in the future. Cleverness and sophistication are a key part of his appeal to people who look for that extra bit of something in our books.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Just silly fun, had a good time watching it.  would recommend it for an evening of relaxation and disengaging your brain
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was well done for its purpose and genre.  Not the best written or the best book ever, but for its intended audience, it's a real winner.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|At first one can solve several problems but in the end it becomes too difficult and I gave up on it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I can't stop watching it.  This 2005 remake is totally wonderful and Kiera Knightly gives an amazing performance.  Will read the book next.
1449415881|5.0|This was a Christmas gift. The friend who received it loved it. I will buy more in the future. Thanks
0316044695|1.0|Marcus Luttrell may be a good soldier, but he's a terrible writer. His plodding, clumsy style betrays him as a complete imbecile, which explains why he celebrates George W. Bush as a great leader. If Luttrell had omitted his ultra-conservative opinions which he can't resist injecting into every page, perhaps the book would be semi-readable. As it stands, I've read essays by seventh graders which are more articulate.
B00APUYN0I|2.0|This is a good movie to watch if you are just wanting to stare at the screen and not do any deep thinking; or any thinking at all for that matter. I really was not expecting much, but sometimes movies like this surprises me. Not this one!
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|This book is awesome! It's funny too. The part about the cheese is sorta disgusting. That's why I gave it 4 stars. But besides that, it was great.
0525953728|5.0|excellent reading and i appreciate the first hand facts, not the news medias interpretation. i appreciate those guys and gals who sacrifice so much, especially their family life to protect us and really don't want recognition.<br />TRUE HEROES
B005M0PJ8Q|5.0|Arrived on time and in excellent shape.  For traveling so far, it was right on time.  Very pleased with the order.
B007C94QRK|5.0|Such a great movie. You can tell decal really is a fan of the show. It definitely brought something extra to this movie. But when you get down to it this is classic muppets. Don't hesitate watch this movie
B008TMA1LY|3.0|This app is very fun but can get very hard without characters(that cost real money).Very similiar to diner dash but I would recommended diner dash over this app.That is why I gave this app 3. stars instead of 5.;)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When you get this game you can`t exit of your kindle fire hd<br />When I tried to get the game off my kindle it won't com off
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I really liked these.  Even though the sex parts were vivid, they had to be told.  The 1st book the ending I felt sorry for her.  The 2nd book I felt that you got to know the girl.  The third book had a lot of twist and turns and the bad guys got theirs in the end. These were books that you couldn't wait to turn the page to see what was going to happen next.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This is actually a 4 and a half rating. This game is one of the best fps on any device.works great on my kindle fire. Absolutely no lag. Multiplayer is awesome and so is the campaign. Only one problem. When you move around the buttons are so close to where you swipe to turn so you press them when you don't need to the fire button is also hard to find while running. Overall best game Eva. Worth the six dollars.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I really like this version of Solitaire, however, it was a pain to click off the adversing before every hand. I do object to advertising about hooking up with men or women, I think that is very uncalled for Amazon to promote anything like that.
1582880956|5.0|Watership Down is one of those classic works that really needs to be read.  This particular edition is especially useful because of the notes and guides and reader's companion in the back of the book.  Though I've read this novel many times over the years, I actually gained new insights from the stuff in the back, which indicates their utility to any interested reader.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely love the hunger game books, best series I've ever read. I'll probably end up reading the books over again!
1601252463|5.0|The service and quality of the seller is unimpeachable.  As for the product itself, it makes an excellent game expansion.  While not essential to playing the game, it does open up more fun options, and that makes it worthwhile.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such an amazing story, I can not wait to finish this amazing series of books. A love story unlike any other.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|This is a film that you shouldn't ever take seriously.  If you do, you're missing the point.  This is an action-adventure blend of science-fiction and fantasy, and I think it's a great tribute to the original comics.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I love this movie. It is very close to the video game, more so than stupid final fantasy spirit within.
B001S86J0I|5.0|This hilarious comedy is somewhat a parody of Star Trek, but at the same time, it has powerful enough performances that it can stand on its own.  This was a Christmas gift, and it arrived in excellent speed and quality.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Please keep carrying this amazing holiday gift disc! adults and children alike have loved this over my years of giving it!
B000002LND|5.0|For a special someone, this was a perfect gift, and at such a reasonable price, and for such excellent quality.
0152023984|5.0|This is an inspiring book for little boys. I am very happy with the size and that is is available in hardcover.
B0001I55SS|5.0|This is a Disney movie.  Bear that in mind when you pop it into your player.  Okay, now you've seen it.  Bear in mind, that was a Disney movie you just watched.  Blows your mind, doesn't it?  They don't make science-fiction like this very often, and though some of the special effects are a bit dated, the acting is beyond compare, and the direction unsurpassed.  This is storytelling at its finest.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|The actor playing Thor is wow!  It was inventive, humerous and once again I have nothing more to say on

B003B5M0PO|5.0|Touching story, easy to read and hard to put down.<br />Enjoyed reading this as an adult and will now enjoying listening to my son read it too.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Martial arts comedies are hard to pull off.  This movie is one of the better ones, and its Warner Brothers cartoon-esque style of physical humor is astonishingly slapstick and fun.  It's more of a niche film, but if you think you're in that niche, then I must recommend it.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|So I am not a big fan of all the remakes of old 80's and 90's movies.  Example of that would be the new \\"Total Recall\\", which in my opinion was not as good as the original, just had better effects.  And that was my concern for this movie.  However, I think this modern day \\"Dredd\\", did a much better job telling a story and in presentation.  The original \\"Judge Dredd\\" from the 90's was very campy I thought.  \\"Dredd\\" does a better job of staying true to the original comic indention and has a much darker and gritter feel. The story line and character development are much better as well.<br /><br />Granted Dredd as a character, doesn't have much character development, but the rookie does, and the movie seems to be more about her than Dredd.  Which I thought was well done.  And the two kinda played off each other.  Dredd, being the 'by the book justice' and the rookie Anderson showing more compassion.  Which leads to the underlining them of the movie, should justice be dispensed coldly or compassionately.  Yeah its kinda a stretch for an action movie with a lot of violence. But I thought the underling question and theme was done well.<br /><br />So the guts of the most reviews is \\"should I spend the money to rent or buy this movie?\\"  Yes.  It is entertaining, better then the old one, and well presented, and worthy of you hard earned cash.
B002ZG994U|5.0|Honestly, either you like action movies or you don't.  And if you like them, you'll probably like this one lots.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Story reminds me of a bad Japanese Anime. Trying to be all epic and amazing but just a mess and tiresome.  The twists in this film are terrible. Christian bale seems constipated. More terrible character voices i.e. bane.  Ann hathaway has no sex appeal which is a must for cat woman.  Why so do people like this film?  I guess a lot of people are happy enough with big hollywood names and big hollywood budgets. Wish Bane just killed batman and destroyed gotham to put an end to the franchise. Thor was much better than this.
B004UPANAI|5.0|Just what I needed for a Christmas present.  Fine quality and fast service, too, which is a big plus all around.
145260830X|3.0|The audiobook is read by an American, yet the book is written with a number of English/euro expressions which the American narrator pronounces incorrectly. Examples: the derogatory word for gay \\"Poof\\" is pronounce Poo-f, rather than P-oof. Wunderkind is pronounced Wonder-kind rather than vonderkin-d.<br />Otherwise the story was fair but not amazing like the games.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|What more can I say than that it was free?  Really, there isn't anything else to be said, except that it was, and the contents of the classic are what I expected.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Played easily and very easy to read.  New layouts were fun, made some decisions harder. had a lot of fun.

B000MNP2K8|5.0|Daniel Craig is by far the best Bond ever.no gadgets,no mystery, just a genuine straight in your face bad ass..he's number one and Rodger Moore smells like number two
B004EPZ07K|4.0|The seller's work was fine indeed, and I have on complaints on that front.  The movie itself was pretty good - I'd say that it would be a fine movie for those who need a good-quality superhero fix while waiting for the next Batman or Spider-man movie.
B0000027RL|3.0|sound quality sucks...its a shame cause the album is essential Pearl Jam.. im gonna get the re-done double cd....and shoot this one

0062197266|5.0|Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. I am recommending this book to every woman I know!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Overall, this movie is almost a must-see for fans of vampire and monster movies or history.  It is also based on such an absurd concept that its awesome-factor is enhanced, thanks to its fine quality acting and cinematography, rather than reduced.  The only objection I have is the very brief nudity that appeared in the movie, which I feel was an unneccessary distraction, and detracted from the overall experience.
B000AU9UYC|4.0|It was a gift for someone who likes the batman movies . . . .. . . . . .
1601253788|5.0|Bestiaries are a necessity for any game intended to surprise its players on a regular basis.  This was in top-notch quality when it arrived, and shipped rapidly.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|it is good but I don't like how u have 2 buy peanuts and that you have to pay to get out. also they force you to pay peanuts at the beggining
B004LWZW42|4.0|The loss of one star in my review comes because the movie contained stronger language than was really needed.  Otherwise, however, I would recommend this to most anyone.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Bought this for my husband. Excellent quality he loved it.Would recommend to anyone who enjoys this kind of classical film.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|The movie was great, and the service from the seller almost as good.  Really, this is almost a must-see for any senior citizen who has a liking for action movies.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Bought this for my husband. Excellent quality he loved it.Would recommend to anyone who enjoys this kind of classical film.
B00005OCMR|5.0|This is *the* way to view the original classic.  At least, it would have been, if someone hadn't stolen my copy - no fault of the seller or the post office, mind, just my own carelessness.  Ah well, at least I got to enjoy it while I had it, and I recommend others do the same.<br /><br />Tron is a unique movie, as the later attempt to revitalize the series demonstrates.  This is an epic, as opposed to the more recent movie, which is a typical rebellious young person movie, focusing on a single fairly bland main character and his romantic interest to the exclusion of all the much more interesting characters that could have shared the spotlight, but weren't allowed to do so.
B009XWD02G|1.0|all this app does is fart when you type in an artist you cant download it but when you click on the music note it tarts!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a very good book, it kept my attention, I gave it a 4 instead of 5, because it wasn't as detailed and exciting as some other books I have read, but still very good
B00571F26Y|5.0|This author and book has changed my life.  I have been quite ill this past year but no doctor had been able to find what was wrong....lose a little weight, exercise....but I couldn't exercise and my diets weren't working.  I saw Dr. Davis on Dr. Oz and the bells went off and I ordered the book immediately and stopped eating bread.  Now I am wheat free, lost 10 pounds immediately and have so much energy my housework gets done and I am in Zumba class and Yoga....no problems.<br />This book is easy to read and understand and is inspirational in what this &#34;diet&#34; can do.<br /><br />D
B0084BMUFA|5.0|After years of watching countless versions of the movie I decided to read the book. Glad I did well worth it, very short if I'd had the time would've done it in one sitting. Might make it a new Christmas tradition.
B000IZA9PI|2.0|Weak story packed with hackneyed, cheap plot devices, shallow character development...but the biggest crime this movie commits is the tragic mismanagement of Tom Hardy. He's forced into the role of a flimsy villain with a shiny cape, horrendously misdirected and stifled. Watch any of his other movies, definitely check out his audition on youtube for this film, and compare. Tragic waste of talent.
0345803507|5.0|I ordered this book to complete the trilogy of the Fifty Shades books.  I loved it as it was the last book in the series and told the ending!  Would recommend this to most any book lover.
B0056031VY|4.0|This DVD is a good remake of an old classic. There have been truer to the book films made, but this one is entertaining and close enough to be enjoyable.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It's a must-see.  The acting is great, and it's not too inappropriate.  I hope the second is just as good.  However, a parent should probably watch it with anyone under the age of 12 or 13.  Mainly cause of the violence and such.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Great box set with all three movies at a low price. Great gift idea for those who love Batman and other superheroes
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this show can't wait till Wednesday nights to see it. Best horror series since Dark Shadows in the 70s. Not for young children but great for adults with a taste for the bizarre.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to d/l this, but I'm sure glad I did.  For the &#34;friend' character, try drawing something other than a stick person.  I drew our dog &#34;Benji&#34; and then it becomes &#34;The Search For Benji&#34;!  A lot of creativity went into this app and I personally haven't played anything else quite like it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really love this book.....this whole series actually ..... I cried more in this book than I did the other two. I loved and will always love it! <3
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I was about 6 years old when Atari 2600 came out, and Radiant HD takes me right back to that feeling of early gaming in a great way.  The graphics and sound effects are perfect for pulling you in.  The upgrades make the overall experience a challenging one.  I'd definitely recommend this.  Some people complained about getting this to run properly on their device, but it works perfectly every time on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I initially gave this app one star because I could not figure out from the little getting started document that the installer loads how you were supposed to open files on the (original) Kindle Fire outside of the \\"Recents\\" context.  This is the context that opens up by default when you first open the app after having viewed the installation \\"getting started\\" pdf.  There didn't appear to be a way to open other documents in the Documents or Download folders on the device, and the only file context I could get it to show was \\"Recents\\" with the little, vague, \\"getting started\\" pdf.  The getting started pdf does not actually show how to open pdf files outside of the web or email. There also didn't appear to be a way to cause the Kindle to use Adobe Reader instead of the built-in pdf reader when opening pdf files outside of the Adobe app.  I tried tapping and other gestures in a number of places on the screen and what menus I could get to come up did not show me any of the pdf documents already on the device, and I could not find any web information that showed how to do this on the original Fire.<br /><br />What I finally discovered completely by accident is that if you tap the little horizontal bars (similar to the \\"menu\\" icon you see at the bottom of some other apps' screens) in the upper left-hand corner of the \\"Recents\\" context, it will open a full \\"Documents\\" context that will show you all (I think) of the pdf files on the device, and then you can open other pdf files from there.  I could swear that I had already tried tapping this particular icon a couple of times with no reaction from the device, but whether that corner of my screen is getting a little insensitive, or whether there was some other reason it wouldn't switch to the \\"Documnets\\" context when I tried it earlier, I don't know.  What I do know is that I never saw anything anywhere that said this little icon in the upper left-hand corner of the Recents page is where you had to tap to open up any files other than the first \\"Getting Started\\" pdf.<br /><br />Except for the frustration of spending several hours crawling the web and trying to figure this out, I would probably give this app 4-5 stars.  I think it's a bit better than the built-in app, if only because you can do searches.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This is a fun app.  Very creative and interesting.  It's fun to see other peoples' reactions when they try it out the first time.  Not something you'll use over and over, but a cool app nonetheless.
B008OHV5QO|1.0|This video is all about taking a ride in a classic car (nice car!) around Neil Young's hometown.  In the beginning as he is talking about what it was like growing up, he makes a statement about blowing up a turtle by sticking a firecracker up its backside, adding a comment suggesting that this was normal for young boys to do.  Neil--this is NOT NORMAL!  It is horrendous and you should be ashamed!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Excellent radio app.  I either use this or Pandora for all of my music needs.  Each one has its own pluses and minuses, so it really rounds out your options.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love Taylor Swift. She is a great role model for girls. She has a very sweet modest style which I think is rare in an artist of her stature. I admire this very much in her and I hope she never looses her innocence like so many other artists have before her.<br /><br />Red is her fourth studio album. It was released on October 22, 2012 through Big Machine Records. The album features collaborations with new producers and guest artists such as Gary Lightbody and Ed Sheeran, and sees Swift experimenting with new musical genres. The Red Tour is scheduled to begin in March 2013. The insert to the album has all the words so you can sing along if you want to and each song has a different picture of Taylor.<br /><br />State of Grace, Treacherous and We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together are my favorites on the album. The songs Red, 22 and We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together are very pop, they remind me a little of Avril Lavigne. I love Avril too, so they work well for me. The Last Time features Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol and has a wonderful orchestra in the background and is a gorgeous duet. Holy Ground is upbeat and fast at first then slows and gets upbeat and fast again...great to dance to. Sad Beautiful Tragic is slow and melancholy. The Lucky One is about fame and fortune and where it actually gets you...kinda sad, but true, I guess. Everything Has Changed features Ed Sheeran. Most the songs in Red are about relationships, good and bad. Red is the color of intense emotions at both ends of the spectrum:  love and anger.  The whole album is apparently about her experiences with love...\\"Swift\\" and crazy at times. It is definitely one of her most dynamic albums to date, but I believe she pulls it off well.<br /><br />DISCLOSURE/DISCLAIMER: I received this product for free to facilitate my review.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|I've learned not to play this right before bed, because I can't shut it off.  Very addictive.  Similar to some other games out there, but still a lot of fun.  It looks great on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.
B0096I9UTE|4.0|Australian born, Kylie Minogue has been a global pop icon for 25 years. She has had 60 million global album sales, multiple hit singles, global tours, collaborations, countless industry accolades, acting roles and TV appearances. In 1987 her music career started when she released her first single; a remake of the 1962 Little Eva hit \\"Locomotion\\". She has been singing and acting ever since.<br /><br />Being released in the US on November 6th, this album, The Abbey Road Sessions was recorded in London's legendary Abbey Road Studios with Kylie's band and a full orchestra. As much as I love full orchestras usually, I miss her 80's flair on this album. The songs do not have the same flavor. Her songs don't pop in the same way and are not as upbeat. The sixteen tracks on this album have been radically re-imagined and rearranged. She had always wanted to record in this way and so it was one of those things I think that she needed to do and I applaud her in living out her dream.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love the album, but in a totally different way. This album has a more emotional tone to it. Her voice shines and resonates more in this album. The songs are more clear and defined. The orchestral arrangement of this album and sound of the studio gives it a special ambiance. I love the reworked \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\". It still works well with the orchestra. The previously unreleased \\"Flower\\" is one of my favorites on the album. I love the lyrics! She wrote this song years ago following her battle with breast cancer as an ode to the child she hopes to have some day.<br /><br />DISCLOSURE/DISCLAIMER: I received product for free to facilitate my review.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|I was probably 7 or 8 when Missile Command came out.  This game totally brings back all of those memories in a good way.  You can definitely get addicted to saving your buildings.  They've added some extras to the original experience, so it makes for a very fun experience.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|In my opinion, this a good video, it is loosely based on the original series.  It is what I would call a &#34;dark comedy&#34; type of video, for that reason it's not one that I would recommend to everyone.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a great game, but rather time consuming.  I prefer to play games on my tablet that aren't quite as involved, because I can use my PC, 360, or PS3 for a more deep gaming experience.  People without those devices will probably really appreciate this game.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|What a funny video!  Great viewing for the whole family.  I would highly recommend it.  Great family video to watch when it's cold/snowing/raining out.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Fun game with good graphics.  Similar feel to &#34;Marble Madness&#34; back in the 80's, that really caught people's attention at the time.  The cube doesn't always travel the path you'd like, which is where the challenge comes in.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am singed from reading the second book of the Hunger Games.....burning for more, on to the third volume......hear me sizzle?
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This story is so sad and tragic yet very uplifting. It is amazing that someone so young can endure so much and come out so grounded. She is someone that I will always look up to.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great game. It has everything you could want from a hog/adventure. I was very pleased with this game compared to the last few games G5 has put out. The graphics are great. The story line very interesting. The zoom feature works well. This game is worth the money. And don't forget about the bonus  chapter.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I am a fan of RPGs and hack and slashers to no end, and this game seems to fit the bill perfectly! ; Awesome graphics, quite balanced. Hard enough to keep you  entertained, but easy enough to get the hang of it easily. I can' get enough of this tantalizing game!

0765325950|1.0|I have been reading the series since WOT came out. I collect books and have preordered an autographed copy of this one. As is usual I had planned on buying the book to download to my kindle fire on day one since my autographed copy won't ship till February. I now have to wait a month to read the book or purchase 2 copies. There was absolutely no reason to not release the ebook except greed. Harriet wasn't' \\"uncomfortable\\" cashing in on the ebooks for all the other books. The book would make the top ten in any case. I will not purchase the ebook when it comes out. Harriet will never get another penny of my money. I wish the ebook providers would boycott the ebook edition and really hurt the sales. What a  crappy way to end the story.
B000L9EKL0|4.0|reality, genocide, politics, the information was amazing and the story done well.  Made me think of how fragile our freedom is.
B001R60ESE|4.0|A friend of mine had purchased it earlier and I had already seen it.  The shipment of the product was fast.  I would recommend this product.
B0098VXN2Y|5.0|Very funny movie - as a teen, didn't know if I would love it, but I really enjoyed it! Many laugh out loud moments! The video rental itself was also very good quality.
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|When I was searching for a VNC app on my Kindle Fire HD, this was one of the top-rated ones. Never having heard of it before, I checked out the web site to see if it was compatible with my Ubuntu systems. It said that they support Windows, Mac AND LINUX, so I downloaded the app. It was only later that I found out that the ONLY Ubuntu server version is for the old version 12.04 - no use to me nor the majority of Ubuntu users. It also uses a protocol that is NOT VNC. The description of this app should make these things a lot clearer. Now I have to uninstall it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was ok reading but not my kind of book.  Someone else may love it.  It was a book club requirement.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A m axing!! I absolutely loved this book can't wait for the movie to come out. THE CAPITOL IS GOING BANANAS!!!
