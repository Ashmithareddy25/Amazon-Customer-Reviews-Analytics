B00992CF6W|5.0|On my opinion this is a really good game. It's really worth the money. You should get it. I think that it is better than the free version I can tell you that.
B007SGM084|5.0|A remarkable read, that leaves you wanting more. I find myself laughing,breathing a little heavier at times biting my lip. Its every grown women's dream! You feel sexy reading this. I promise (;
B0088W4YTK|5.0|to bad they canceled it. talented cast. good story line. they don't make scifi like this any more. loved the whole series. stargate sg1 as well.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|read this book and was waiting for the big bang was very disapointed maybe these series have seen their day i loved bared to you but this was boring
B00BCK1A5G|3.0|Had very high hopes for this book and it didn't quite deliver. The fact that a large part of the story took place away from San Francisco made me miss the past characters that I loved in past books and didn't make it into this one. I enjoyed it but not as much as previous books in this world.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|what a great book well done anita you are an inspiration i really enjoyed every page she shared her journey so well i felt like i was there
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Great lyrics, beats, overall Cole came with it! My favorite is Let Nas Down, but there are no slouches on this album.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Like most of the other readers, I was so disappointed to discover that Sylvia Day turned this trilogy into a 5 part series. I feel like this whole book was alot of fluff! I will never pay for a crossfire novel again! I feel so betrayed!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Really  enjoyed Mahjong game. Would recommend to others.<br /><br />The game kept my interest and was able to share it with my kids.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|The  acting , clothing, such a wonderful sense of actually living iin the period. We are new to Amazon and love  it!
B000000OAC|4.0|I have the album but no turntable to play it on. So I bought the cd. Sound quality not perfect. I had to change the volume on a couple of songs,but it does sound like the album,not remixed. I think this was one of Queens best albums!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Incredible cast, great storyline and even has a message. This has been one of my all time favorites for many years.
159463176X|3.0|I'm a huge fan of the author but this book was a disappointment.  It starts out beautifully and draws you in from the beginning.  The problem is the story is so disjointed.  It spans many years and has a host of characters.  Some of them seem like they don't even belong in the story.  The ending was unsatisfying.  Some of the characters were just never mentioned again, their story lines unresolved.  It's as if he had several book ideas and decided to combine them rather than individually flesh them out.<br /><br />Still, his writing is captivating.  If I hadn't read his previous books I might have been less critical of this one.  When he writes another I'll still rush to read it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|set up was simple and also was able to gain access to my book purchases  previously made for my Kindle
B0091WNK8M|5.0|My wife and I watched this again simply because we had watched it many times before with our children growing up. And we were not disappointed! What a wonderfully well done movie that is entertaining for people of all ages! The beautiful Oregon coast doesn't hurt, either. Lots of now-dated 'eighties' references, hair-dos, cars, etc., but that is part of the fun!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|ok ... so how to ...? So lots of gross violence, ruthless, about slavery (again ruthless), of course remembering it is meant as somewhat of an exaggeration but... then again, maybe not? (not exaggerated I mean... because slavery was all that awful and heinous) Bit of an oddly syrupy and still violent, as well, ending that was expected in a way, but I think needed as a release, dialogue kept me interested, as did plot, use of racial slurs throughout but because it was in the context of the setting, was appropriate to make you feel the s***tiness of that kind of language and attitude. (beyond s***ty, but words can only go so far) I am writing this review after watching a lot of interesting commentary after the Paula Dean incident, and as a white person, I never say the n-word and will never, because of what past brought that word about and the hatred and vitriol even in its pronunciation, --- I can't stand that word, but I am glad that this movie has sparked a conversation about \\"our past\\" --- better to discuss it openly I believe than to brush it off....  even so, get ready to have your ears abused...  intense... whew....
B009DH2PP4|2.0|Contains outdated information on secondary fermentation which is clarified by author in a later version, unfortunately in hardcover only at this time.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It's great to be able to have all your favorite music in one place.  I love that I don't have to buy the whole album when I only like one or two songs.
B00940XIGU|5.0|Good samples in the preview; this album is longer and better than the first version, and brings more music to the table for a great deal.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Season 1 kept me coming back for more episodes.  It is the type of series that has action, love, suspense, and many more elements that kepts you wanting to see more.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|Overall this movie was ok... The effects were awesome and I thought pretty good acting... They did well being creative within the Aliens universe that had already been established (hard for prequels to do) and a reason I give it a lot of credit. Unfortunately a lot of the framework was the same and feels like just another Alien movie for a lot of it (I guess minus Sigourney). So overall was good to watch and enjoyable but besides a few creative (though unfinished) storyline turns, it won't knock your socks off.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's kind of like temple run. It's such a fun game if u like running and jumping and sliding while being chased then you should get this
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is just funny. As some of the reviewers said,I just wish it was longer.  A great insight into what her life has been like.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|I am an avid scifi buff, I love it. ID4 is a great movie, even though it is overplayed on TV. Now we have the full version on DVD. I can't wait for the sequel to come out.
B00DENXXZ4|1.0|Will not stream stream my movies. Every movie I try just stays in the processing stage. Tried doing it from kindle and on computer.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Great selection of new music by my favorite guys from Boston! Loved it as expected! Great mix of music as usual!
0345529057|5.0|Excellent! Great read - couldn't put it down.  Fills in where the tv show leaves holes in the story.  Great gift set too!
B00846REIS|2.0|I like sex scenes if they are in context. Gratuitous  sex is not for me. Sorry I did not like the book or the part that I endured.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Fun game. great way to kill time,  but also very challenging. I have experienced trouble with saving my game and that has kept me from beating it, that's the only bad thing. . . . kinda a big deal i guess.  . .
B000002C2E|5.0|What can I say, it's Dylan. Great music, was not dissapointed at all. One of the all time best cds for the year. If you're a fan this is a must have.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are amazing. I like the fact that unlike other pet games this is not in realtime so you can play in your own time without  worrying that your horse might die on you if you forgot to feed it.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|This game is Great for kids. Not to difficult  for adults. Will help pass time and keep kids busy without them being upset for losing
B007L3BMGA|1.0|It is simply badly written and contains egotistical spoiled brat inner dialogue drivel.  I agree with the other readers who gave this one star - it is not even worth that much. Very disappointing.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Clear and approachable, Sandberg comes across in her book in the way we wish all our managers and mentors would communicate with us.  She has something of value to share with anyone in any position in the workforce.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I love this version of match three, but don't love that just as you get into it your free version ends and you have to buy the full one to continue. Not cool.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|i have this game for a long time and it would not stop gliching after a wail and because it gliches it doesn't cach your touch
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great series of books.  Good story line.  Great characters.  Can't wait to read the next book. You'll love the story
B005COO1X6|5.0|I give it 5 stars because it is a modern day classic from the Master himself! The book is great! If you are a fan of his work you will enjoy Mile 81!
B00422LESO|4.0|good, fun and funny book. just what I needed for  a summer read. helpful to know some of Austen's main characters, but not necessary.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game!I would say that this is a great game for horse lovers:) and if you think it is not a fun game you are crazy!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|FirePenguin approved! Awesome when I can't play Magic online or in person. May get a little boring after time - we'll see, but for now a lot of fun!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is the John Grisham I know and love. The entire book kept me glued to the pages... I couldn't put it down. One of his best.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is fabulous. It's free so I don't mind the ads which are unobtrusive. I love the selection of waking sounds and the ability to set multiple alarms.
B00008G7UJ|4.0|This film remains a classic. The mix of modern imagery and the original (or close to original) text astound and delight.
0770437400|2.0|The first 100 pages were a fun and extraordinarily engaging read.<br /><br />The second 100 pages were an moderately adequate read.<br /><br />The third 100 pages were painful and desultory, and essentially a repeat of the prior 200 pages.<br /><br />I didn't make it through the last 100 pages.<br /><br />The stories become repetitive and flat after the first half of the book. More civilian accounts might have held my interest more, but too many of these stories revolve around military settings. Thus, for most of the book I cannot identify with the characters. The book is very well-researched, but the military jargon acts as a barrier to becoming involved with many of the stories.<br /><br />Probably the biggest flaw, though, is that every character sounds the same. Brooks has no capacity for creating any variety in the characters' voices. The whole book, you only hear Max Brooks.<br /><br />Great premise, lukewarm execution. My advice: get from the library or borrow from a friend. Once you start becoming weary with the stories, stop reading. The feeling only grows.
B00BSO2U1Y|4.0|This is my favorite opera and I was curious to hear how Bartoli would handle it. I was not disappointed. I would have prefer someone other than Sumi Jo as Adalgisa and John Osborn's voice was also a little light for the role (especially in the larger ensembles).
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun trying to find all the codes and secret compartments.  The codes you find go to things you have not even found yet.  Good challenges and problem solving skills work out.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book took me a lot longer to read than the other two, kind of had a slow beginning. Still necessary to know the ending for katniss though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so much fun and it really teaches u how to take care of this animal after having horses all my life it is good to know these games are out there to show kids how go take care of their pets
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book!! Couldn't stop reading it!!! I can't wait to read more about Gideon and Eva!!
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|I bought this for my dad, and he was surprised that were still more Hendrix songs out there.  As far as my father is concerned, you can't go wrong with Jimi.
B0091V6TF4|3.0|However the second CD in th set was a lot of obscure &#34;background type music.&#34;  I recognized one song on the entire disc.  Sound quality was great, but I'd go for a theme song set instead of this collection.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Love this app. You can see what the weather is at home and where friends and family live.  It allows for trip planning.  The radar maps are very useful. The only issue w radar map is future maps do not seem to line up with past or actual weather.
B001NKI60W|5.0|What can I say. Great cast, Abba music, fun dancing, cute story and frantisic senery. It is a favorite among my friends
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I would love to be able to play with my kids or have them play each other along with computer but it is a one player only game. :(
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Such a great read. Not at all a preditcable plot. Glad that my book club chose it. Will her work again.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Wanted Candy Crash, since I can't get it decided to try this.  It is dispointing can't replace the one I really want.  Can only give it an okay.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Was recomended by a friend. It turned out to be a great movie. Really enjoyed watching. Glad I own it
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow this app is amazing!in play this app every day.and it always keeps me busy.so if u r look for a game that u can do anything u Want to and build anything u want to you should get this game
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I LOVE Josh Groban's voice and have several cds that are practically worn out. However, this one is not particularly good. Perhaps others will like it, but it's jut not my cup of tea. I found the song selection and orchestration boring, frankly, and skipped ahead to see what else might be better. Sorry, Josh.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I really love this game but keep dying in level 3-1 right when the game starts for no reason.  Has this happened to anybody else if so can it be fixed?
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I have looked forward to reading this book for some time and I was in no way disappointed.  The quality of writing was extremely good, it made reading the story as if you were there during the road from the start to the finish, distinctive worst of it.  The story, the bravery, the unbending courage to continue the fight no matter what might come brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />As a Marine that had my time, this story both broke my heart and made my chest swell with pride both because if the courage and fight in these men and for the love of each other that only someone who's been in it would understand.  I couldn't possibly recommend a book higher than this one.  Semper Go.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Began watching the movie on TV and was unable to finish viewing.  Found the DVD and bought it .  Very touching movie about the bonds that form between a man and his dog.  His companion.  Wonderful movie - have the tissues ready.
B00AYB1RXE|5.0|I instantly fell in love with this movie.  Documentary style is well done, the music is wonderful and the story truly touching.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie is awesome! When I saw it in the theater, I wanted to go back and see it again. It's action from start to finish, one of the great parts about this film are the little bits of comic relief in the film. It doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't go over the top with the superhero bits.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|Nice to see how difficult it was for them to get the respect and opportunities.  Combat scenes were very exciting...
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is so fun! you check on your islands once ir twice a day and eventually you are a top notch dragon keeper! the breeding system is great and you never know what you will get! TONS OF FUN!!!!! (hint try breeding lava and sonic dragons! they give rare dragons such as Olympus, sun, seasonal, etc.)<br /><br />  Anyway, BUY THIS GAME!!!!! only annoying thing is it takes a lot of time to breed dragons.......<br /><br />  would give 7 stars if I could!!!!!!!!!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I loved this movie as I am a big fan of Lord of the rings series. This is one of its own class. Show is fully involved and keeps you on your toes. Great buy. If you would ask me I would rate this a 100%. Quality and sheer class. Simply remarkable.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|At 66 I get tired of violence and heavy social messages.  At times I just want a fun, well done, heartwarming adventure.  The GOONIES is a favorite that I watch at least twice a year.  When I drag home from work and want something light and positive - this is one of those movies I pop into the player and enjoy while making dinner, ironing, or just relaxing.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Overall, this IS a good film. But if you're expecting something that follows the original to the letter, you're gonna be disappointed, or pleasantly surprised, depending on your expectations. It's not the complete book adaptation that Return to Oz was. But it's not the happy musical either.<br /><br />First, I'd like to explain why I only gave it four stars.<br /><br />James Franco as the Wizard - In the beginning, he seems to be ok in the role. But much like Judy Garland's performance. It seemed that the script was perhaps written for someone else. In the original film, the script was written for Shirley Temple but her studio wouldn't allow her to do the movie. While Garland's performance is iconic to the original and she brought a kind of melancholy yearning to the role that the more 'cutesy' Temple never could have, it was clear that the role had been written for another actress, a younger one. In the case of Franco, he has a sort of Old Hollywood, pretty boy look, especially when made up for the Wizard. No doubt the reason that he was chosen. But some of his facial expressions seem forced, as if he had been told, 'look more like (insert name of actor really wanted)'. This is not so obvious in the black and white portion of the film, where I thought that maybe Disney did it intentionally, but there are times that it seems a little bit too 'forced'. But it's very obvious in the color portion. There are times when he tries to give that smile that is reminiscent of Johnny Depp in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or his kind of disgusted look from Sleepy Hollow. The projection of Franco's voice seems a bit forced as well, and he has a kind of 'modern' quality that I don't believe was intentional.<br /><br />Mila Kunis as the Wicked Witch - She has a kind of grotesque beauty, the same that Margret Hamilton had as the witch. While she doesn't have Hamilton's 'plain jane' type look. She has a more obvious, dark beauty. In the witch makeup, she does look believable. However...her hysterical shrieking, gets old. The first time, it's warranted. Then after that, it's like 'oh she's shrieking again...' I feel that a more quiet approach would have suited some of the instances better. Such as when the Wizard tells her that she may return to the Emerald City should she find goodness again, if she'd looked back and stoically said 'Never' perhaps with a little shake of her head and then laughed. It would have been more believable. But instead she shrieks it and flies off. It's also obvious that she's the voice of Meg in Family Guy. She has that same sarcasm in both Family Guy and That 70s Show, which detracts from her portrayal as the witch. Her costume doesn't fit her character. It's a more modern design, while her character suggests a more traditional or perhaps totally different design. Again, like with Franco's entire character. The witch's costume looks as though it were designed for someone else.<br /><br />The clash of accents - There's a lack of congruity with the accents. First, there's the English accent of Rachel Weisz, while her portrayal of Evanora was very good. She was one of the few completely believable characters that was consistent throughout the film and seemed to be comfortable in her role. The more 'california or modern' accent of her sister seems out of place. As does the lack of the ethereal voice of Glinda. She has a quietness about her, but not the more 'angelic' voice. James Franco has a kind of flat tone to his voice, so he doesn't sound as though he's from Kansas nor does he have the rolling r's or the grand quality that the actor in the original had. Had he put that 'grandness' in his voice during the black and white portion, I feel it would have at least added something.<br /><br />A childlike quality- This film is rated PG and some of it seems overly childish. No doubt because it is Disney and it was taken into consideration that a stronger rating would no doubt have hurt ticket sales since parents would have wanted to bring children. However, I feel that the overly brightness of the flowers and some of the sets in the initial arrival in OZ are a bit over the top. While the flying monkies of the witch have been turned into flying baboons that rip people to shreds. Then you have the cute little china doll running around, but she has a miniature knife in one part. It's an imbalance of the darkness and light. One thing seems overly childish while another seems overly dark.<br /><br />A very suspicious Tim Burton quality - This movie has a very Burtonesque quality. Which at first made me smile. But as the film progresses, it's more forced. As if it were done by a fan or someone that was trying to give it a Tim Burton look. I think that maybe that was the problem. Danny Elfman does the music which is very suspicious since he does the music for nearly all of Tim Burton's films. There are certain suspect set designs and the opening sequence made me expect to see Burton's name SOMEWHERE on this film. However, it's not. In watching the film a second time, the Oz character as well as Theodora almost seem as though they might have been written for Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. The wicked witch's costume looks as though it were designed with Carter in mind, not Kunis. Which to me is very suspect.<br /><br />Now that the cons are out of the way, here are the pros<br /><br />Welcome deviations from the original - Normally when a film like this one comes along, it's either a welcome new film or a sad knockoff. I feel this one is the former. Because instead of making blatant references to the original and having a bunch of knock off music or characters, this film does stand alone. In the fact that there are parallel characters in the black and white sequence that are in the color sequence as well. But these character's names and look is different. For example a reference is made to a 'John Gale' not Henry. And all of the main characters in Oz are not showcased in the black andwhite sequence. Noticeably missing from the black and white portion, are Evanora, Theodora, Knuk and the master Tinker. Which to me suggests that this is not a 'dream' as was the case with Dorothy's trip to Oz. The only characters that are from the black and white portion are Glinda who plays a woman named Annie that is obviously in love with Oz and he returns that love but is unwilling to admit it or settle down. His assistant Frank, who's Oz counterpart is a talking, flying monkey named Finlay. And the little china girl who is obviously the girl in the wheelchair at his show. He couldn't help the girl in the wheelchair walk. But he fixed the china girl's legs. Symbolic of something he couldn't do in the 'real world'. Glinda is Glinda the Good from the SOUTH, not north. At times, there are musical portions that almost sound like Somewhere Over the Rainbow, but not quite and almost sound like portions of the original score, but not quite.<br /><br />Absence of cheesy costumes - For 1939, the costumes were very appropriate in the original. But if they'd been referenced in this one it would have been a disaster. For example, having a kind of ball gown pink dress for Glinda or the large wand with a star at the end would have seemed childish. As would the over use of green in the costumes of the Emerald City Denizens. There is a use of deep green tones in the Emerald City clothing. But not the bright green over the top costumes. There's a kind of steampunk quality instead, that makes it very visually appealing.<br /><br />No song and dance numbers - There's really only one song sung in the entire film. And it's cut short. Another welcome deviation from the original.<br /><br />The absence of the original title characters - There is a lion, there are scarecrows and there are munchkins. But there's no Tin Man. No dancing scarecrow, no Lollipop Guild or Lullaby League. Which was very refreshing in my eyes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lovely this app!!! Had me hooked from the moment it got it!  A must-have free app!!<br />Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game gets your brain working trying to find the next tool so you can get the elevator door to open to get to the next room. I like it. kind of frustrating until you get what's going on then it gets fun!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love love this show! I can hardly wait for the new season! So much excitement. I love all of the characters!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is a good book. It looked like it was boring at first but whr i read it was very intresting
0553382179|5.0|Book about housekeeping seem boring and pointless but the philosophy here, just about getting starting,  is invaluable and really sticks out as truth for anyone who's ever had to keep house.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My g'daughter  really like s this game.  It is easy for her to play.  I like it also.<br />We play it together.
B008FVZHKO|5.0|porcupine tree is like strawberry alarm clock with compositional skills and musicianship skills. every song is like a short or a long symphony. they are criticized by musically obtuse critics, i have noticed by \\"being like\\" this or that band. there is no band that porcupine tree is like. other bands would do well to try and be like porcupine tree. cut 3, Anesthetize, is a minor masterpiece of writing._____jj solari
B0053ZOQMK|3.0|Didn't stand out as particularly funny or interesting. Quite predictable but left a lot of questions unanswered.<br />Wouldn't recommend it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend who has excellent taste in books.  I was totally absorbed by Lavinia's story and could not stop reading (so many times hoping for a different outcome).  The  author is a wonderful writer who made a story set in a horrible time for human rights in this country new and compelling.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I absolutely love it can't wait to get the next season. Is Oct here yet? LOL So excited for the new season
B00009RAJH|5.0|This almost plays like a greatest hits album.  One of the best albums of the 70's California pop/rock scene.  Thank you to Sound Factory for making this an instant classic...and thank you Mick for bringing on two new little rockers who would change the band forever.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Plenty of action and great actors. Sean Penn was surprisingly good as Mickey Cohen. Josh Brolin was the protagonist, and did do an excellent job in his portrayal of Sergeant O'Mara, even though the character had confusing traits. Ryan Gosling his usual decent self. Overall great movie for a weekend night. note; possibly too much violence for young children.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is my 3rd Anker product I have purchased. Each has done its job well. I can see purchasing another one of their items soon.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The trouble with such famous epics is that the ending will never please everyone. Thus, do not expect that you will love the ending. However - given the choices that Jordan/Sanderson had in terms of possible endings - I think they did a fabulous job and I loved every bit of it.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I love the crossfire series! So amazing! It keeps me turning the paging and going on this journey with Eva and Gideon. Thank you Sylvia day!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome and I love it you should add actual hunger<br />This game is really good and I look forward to updates
B00A44HRG2|3.0|I deleted this app it looked like more then I was looking for, I'd like some thing on the easier side.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great Game. Wow didn't know I was that smart lol. All 10 levels past can wait for more... it was a bit challenging but I guess it's the point of the game.
B002N57KG2|4.0|Loved it the first time...still do! Why can't they make movies like this any more? Worth over and over and over!
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Played the tutorial and it was enjoyable, but you need an offline mode were you can do survival and other modes
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I read the novel because I enjoyed the movie. I rarely say this, but the movie was much better than the book.
B009IJJ5B4|3.0|The writer's have done a good job with a 'Sherlock-like',  clue ferreting detective, and Lucy Lieu is compelling. I would have enjoyed this more if they had simply based the main character on Sherlock Holmes - he is definately NOT Sherlock Holmes, and being an Arthur Conan Doyle fan, I find myself having to work around this &#34;NOT SHERLOCK HOLMES&#34; character in order to enjoy the series.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|tommy lee manages to pick good movies to star in. he has a grasp of what will do well. this was entertaining.
0385737947|3.0|Good mystery. Could do without all the profanity disguised as new words (see my headline). Author has an afinity for gore obviously designed to appeal to younger audiences. Might ask a friend how it all ends, might not.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Sensational series. Hope they don't end this great drama like they ended another wonderful series Upstairs Downstairs, the new generation.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is great. I don't have  to wait for the buildings to be constructed. It's amazingly fun to see the animals play in there cage.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|This was a great series - could not wait for the last one but the ending was a shock and I want to know if there is another book in the works.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|And their staff. Good story line made even better by the character acting. Great job of picking the right actors for each part. Brilliant!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a great story of how an intelligent child, who just happens to have some extremely useful abilities for the society, has his life transformed for the good of his family, and species.  His one quality of boldness and recognizing his personal limitations, ends up helping him defeat a superior enemy.  This story can resonate with all gifted children who frequently end up losing a childhood, but gaining fame and fortune. A really interesting take on extreme talent.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|And their staff. Good story line made even better by the character acting. Great job of picking the right actors for each part. Brilliant!
B000FC12SM|5.0|If you're in a relationship this book is a must have.  It's amazing how different men and women are and this book shows you how to navigate threw that in order to improve your life.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|Great action! Almost believable. Forced me to lookup a number of things and loved to have been enlighten  On to the next Sigma!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this family both in the drawing room and in the servants' quarters.  Superb acting has made the characters come alive.  And real life situations make the story believable.  Can't wait to see the next season.
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|Does the job, but I prefer a case that doesn't expose a circle in the middle of the back for dust and debris to get in.
B00APYKXFS|3.0|I love side scroller shooters. This one is insane. I scoffed at a 60 second mode upon seeing the title menu for first time. Then I played and realized 60 seconds is a grand achievement.  If you reminesce for the days of SNES when Japan tittered about USA's weak platforming skills and released games that boggled the mind in sheer scope of difficulty and frustration for their shores only, then this game is for you. Requiring acute hyper reflexes and patience in spades this game is not for the casual android platform. Good luck.
B001FB55I0|5.0|Excellent terminator movie that adds more to the conflict and history in the series.  Sequel would surely please diehards like myself.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|It is a unique reality. I like seeing how the characters interact. Some good some bad,but entrataining all the same.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Such a great read, I couldn't put it down!  I have read several of the authors other books and they are all spectacular.
B00DIFARQ6|2.0|Okay,this game is fun but not so easy to control. If tilting your kindle is easy for you, this is the game for you. But for the people that are use to using a joystick or d-pad, this game might be hard. READ REVIEWS BEFORE PLAYING!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book took a couple hundred pages to really get interesting for me, but knowing the author I continued, hoping it would improve, and it did not disappoint. The slow start was more than made up for as the book really picked up speed and I was completely pulled in. The gradual reveal of each character's past and the history of the world that Sanderson has created is masterful, as well as the contemplation of philosophy displayed by the characters.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is mostly fun, but I think you need to spend real money to get the most out of it. Also needs further instructions.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|While it was on BBC I payed no mined. What? I have watched the whole series all seasons save the last on my computer. The New Pimeval isn't as good but the original is great.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Beautiful story & very inspiring! Written from the heart & soul. Good hope for us all especially anyone worrying about death!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I have always loved Hannibal Lector since he came on the scene. He is my favorite evil villian. This show makes you squirm in your seat. Love it.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I loved this book!  The tongue in cheek nature of this story was charming from beginning to end. All the characters were rich....a soul soothing read.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved this series but this book seemed like a layover book one that gets me to the next one but doesn't really have much umps!!!
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|I remember my dad taking me to see this when I was a kid. We were amazed by it. I was obsessed with this movie and never replaced my VHS copy until I decided my kids needed to watch it. Jurassic park on blu ray is amazing! It brought back all they good memories of my childhood. Well worth the upgrade.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|He is a great action guy in all 3 movies, and it is great that they show it can go into the next generation if the powers that be want it to.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great movie that's fun for everyone. You catch something funny each time you watch it. The acting/storyline is good too. Worth watching over and over again.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|It shows that he can carry the movie without a bunch of big Jane stars with him.  Also shoed that he is not as young as he used to be and that the next generation of McClane's aren't slouches either.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|This app distorts all my word documents. Doesn't work as expected. Wish I could get my money back. Don't buy.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|you can never go wrong with Bruce Willis. He always delivers. Great movie. I hope they make another Die Hard.
B009R659L8|5.0|Great book - from beginning to end - I haven't read a book written by Mary Higgins Clark I didn't like or love!
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Glad I didn't buy, sad that I did rent it, went to sleep in the middle and never bothered to try and see the end :(
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I just loved the (3) books - couldn't wait to see how book three would end - every time I had a moment I was found with my Kindle.<br />I wish when the movie is made they would let readers of the books vote - say out of a group of five men chosen for the part of Christian  - its amazing how different people vision a person for the part.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Glad I only rented, good and it past the time, but nothing to write home about, a teen movie at best.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The shock of book one is over - I couldn't put my Kindle down - I heard so much talk of the books while I was in LA - at the hospital - by the nurses -  when my daughter had my granddaughter - they even had a list of babies born - after reading Fifty Shades - how cool was that!
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|The reason I like this band so much is that they are always evolving musically.  There aren't very many artists out there like Hanson who continue to grow as a band.  This album really shows their vocal power as a band.  The three part harmonies are very strong on this album.  I love that this band doesn't over do it with the instrumental piece.  You can really hear the instruments and they aren't over producing and making a lot of noise.  I will continue to be a fan of this band for years to come and look forward to seeing them on tour.
B0053O89WY|5.0|&#34;The Big Bang&#34; is my favorite show, next to Jeopardy. My granddaughters told me, &#34;Grandma, you've GOT to watch this show&#34;.  Now I'm addicted and can hardly wait for year 6 to come out as a DVD.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Don't listen to the other guys. There are no adds. The game never asks for money. 99cents and then you have the full game. Also, Jetpack Joyride copied the gravity suit from this. Get it right. Seriously. This game rocks.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|i did find in the playback the music was considerably louder than the speaking parts-- which caused for some distraction. the story was good overall.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this &#34;prequel&#34; to one of my all time favorite movies. The photography and special effects were beautiful and the story was artfully told. Disney did a good job setting up the dream and giving us a look at how the familiar story came to be. I did miss the ruby slippers for Evanora, but overall, I liked it. Some of the effects might be a little intense for younger children, but, most will like it a lot. I recommend this movie for Oz fans. I can see a major Disney attraction evolving from this movie!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I think this game is super fun and very addicting, I really enjoy playing it and you should as well
B000000WFF|5.0|Love the Spice Girls and their music.  I had the cd before but lost it and could not find it in stores but I knew Amazon would have it. And Amazon does not have the cut and remake versions that people make for kids like stores like Wal Mart have, they have the original versions that I like. Plus, Amazon has different price ranges to choose from, starting from used cds at cheap prices to the newer, pricier ones. I bought  a new one and have had no problems with it technically and jammed out as soon as it was delivered.  Next I will buy Kid Rock from Amazon because his music has alot of language considered offensive to some so stores have the cut and remake cds of Kid Rocks while Amazon has the original.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Very easy to set. And to see. Even without directions. and I can wake to music.I can think about any other way to describe it
B004W1GCNC|5.0|We enjoyed every episode.Too bad that they ended it with season 2! The casting and acting and sets were superb.
B0094M0P4G|5.0|Very enjoyable. The music is great. I pretty much like anything Cher does and I really enjoyed Stanley Tucci's performance as well.
B0063M22QO|3.0|i play this all the time and like it, i also like that it gives you hints when you can't find any other moves.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|It is hard for me to even comprehend living in a time where we had people treated like this. Can't imagine another cast of characters doing any better.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Any lego block set is well made and fun. Duplo is a great introduction to the Lego world. Great little zoo set for a good price.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This is a great game but you got to my gems and the pets cost alot of money.<br /><br />HOW EVER IF YOU CAN SPENT MONEY ON THIS APP YOU ARE GONNA LOVE IT.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm a horse lover and this game is so perfect for one! Such a fun game! Keeps me entertained forever!! (:
B000WGWQG8|5.0|People can rewrite history, but God knows the truth and I believe, John Adams was a good christian, a strong leader and a fantastic example of what the leaders of our country should be.  The DVD's are all I wanted and more than than I expected.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This product is simple, but does exactly what it sets out to do: outputs up to 3.6A of simultaneous power through its two USB ports. The port labeled \\"Apple\\" outputs 2.1A, which is sufficient to charge my iPad 2, Nexus 7, and Samsung Galaxy Note 2 at full speed. Also, no problems charging my wife's iPhone. Note that even though it is labeled \\"Apple,\\" I've found that it works fine on all my devices. The other outputs 1.5A, which will still charge my Nexus 7 and Note 2, albeit slightly slower than intended. I've also tried plugging two devices in at once, and had no problems doing so. The charger itself fits snugly and has a nice, understated design, which I appreciate.<br /><br />My only gripe is that when I purchased it, it was only available in white. Had it been available in black, I would have definitely purchased the black version to better match my car interior and all my devices.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this product. I have also purchased the 3.6A dual port home charger, which I'm equally happy with.<br /><br />If you're looking for nice quality cables to use with this charger (or any charger, for that matter), be sure to check out the Monoprice Premium USB to Micro USB Charge & Sync Cable. It comes in either black or white, and in 3ft and 6ft options. Very inexpensive.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome and extremely fun I love the game it make me think really hard and when I beat it I was like that was fun
1936608898|5.0|If you suffer from Hashimotos (underfunctioning Thyroid), Eczema, IBS/Crones or Migraines...you NEED this book.  Who knew that food caused these diseases and that you could be cured by following a hunter/gather lifestyle?  Is the way of eating extreme?  Yes and no.  We all know that veggies, fruits, meats, and nuts/oils are good for us.  How is that extreme?  Go ahead and leave gluten, sugar, and dairy in your diet..........if you want to continue to use creams for eczema, take levothyroxine, miss work with a migraine, get stomach pain from IBS.  This way of eating will be life changing for you in some way, shape or form.  I FEEL GREAT!!!!
0307887448|5.0|This is truly one of the best books of the year. I LOVED all the 80s references. I rushed right out to my local arcade and dropped $5 on Joust!
B008KP6ENE|4.0|Really great graphics.  Fun to play.  Thanks Crescent Moon for a quality download I look forward to more of your stuff.
B005SJIP1E|5.0|As a younger and poorer man I painstakingly acquired these recordings on vinyl, and they are the mode by which I learned my Mahler.  Since then, I've acquired plenty of Mahler's symphonies on CD or otherwise digitally, but I've yet to find any performances that equal, let alone surpass, this Bernstein set.<br /><br />I'll acknowledge readily that at some point our judgement of particular performances is subjective and a product of our various musical influences.  That said, I'm so pleased to have and listen to these again.  Bernstein and the NY Phil really tap into (for me) the essential spirit and mystery of these scores.<br /><br />In a lot of renderings, that's a matter of tempo and attack -- but in these it's also a matter of tone.  There's something about how the brass, so important in Mahler, does its work in these performances (I attend to this first as a former trumpeter and horn player).  The trumpets, horns, and trombones can play sweetly, sternly, or gently as the occasion arises.  Part of the credit for that goes to Bernstein, but a larger part to the genius of the players, who had the skill to deliver what was asked.  The work of the woodwinds is absolutely breathtaking, especially in solo passages where the rest of the orchestra is subdued.  And the violins of the NY Phil -- well, what a great backbone about which to build a body!<br /><br />I have not so many years left to live, but as long as I have them, I will savor these recordings.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|This is the second of this CD that I have purchased; highly recommend for anyone that is ia beatle fan!
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|This CD just doesn't really have the same AIC sound or feel. They nailed it with they're previous offering (Black gives way to Blue). This one sounds like they're imitating themselves.  Of course the one song that does have their sound written all over it, is the one they played on the radio (Hollow).  A for effort but I hope this CD was more of a getting back into the swing of things.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I really enjoy Mr. Nylund's novels, and really hate how much the VIDEOGAME SLAUGHTERED the BOOK! 343, you screwed that one up big time!<br /><br />Anyways, this book goes more into the creation of the Spartans BEFORE the Covenant came into the picture, back when humanity was in a civil war... [CLASSIFIED]...
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Excelent, incredible, ultra fast, frienly and amazing aplication. Full recomended 200% Welcome to the new age of games my friend. Download,  instal, play and enjoy!
B007SGM084|5.0|Love the happily ever after.  I fell in love with the characters.  Would like to see more than just a chapter written from Christian's perspective.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As good as his previous novels.  He has the ability to make you feel like a member of the family and culture.
B003M70O5O|5.0|every time you think there wont be a new twist all of a sudden ~ you can't stop watching and need to see another episode
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I think this movie deserves more press! I watched it on an airplane home and really enjoyed it, so much so I wanted to see it again, so I rented it. I have recommended it to my friends and family, who also come back saying how much they enjoyed it. Alden Ehrenreich makes the story, his acting is superb and he has some of the best lines, I fell in love with his character. The story line can sometimes be a little silly but in the end, all and all it was a throughly enjoyable movie. I love when a movie makes you feel good and this one did.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not to difficult but makes you pay attention. I would like to see this game have more levels. Great for playing during break at work.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|A well written, compelling storyline comparable to any of the Author's previous works.  Haven't read this author for a few years, and was engrossed from the first chapter.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|remastered  perfectly, it sounds great. dynamic range off the charts. thanks so much. love over gold is a good album to relax to.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is better than the other 2 because Gideon and Eva spent more time together although I wish this was the last book of the series is still a great story line and there is a lot that was left unsaid!! Definitely a must read
B00BQI4AU6|3.0|The CD has all the right ingrediences, a dry rock voice, wild guitars, loud drums and steady bass playing, but it never gets going. I Love the old  Cindarella tunes, the music hangs together and floats from the vokal to the guitars. I think Tom and the Guys try to hard on this CD and then it wont come out right and sounds a bit under pressure
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|My wife and daughter read the book so they wanted to see the movie.  I knew nothing about it and wasn't too excited but I liked it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|well thought out. great graphics. was a lot of fun and easy to use on kindle fire. looking forward to more levels. will definity play more MobiGrow games.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I've been addicted to all things British recently, particularly history, and this show highlights one of the most famous British monarchs of all time.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I love this charger cable. It fits securely when oriented correctly but breaks away if it is pulled or tugged. I like the idea of not using the usb charger port constantly because I hear it can be damaged with extended plugging and unplugging. Charges faster, but my only concern is if the faster charging rate will wear out my Nexus 10 battery sooner. Time will tell.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I bought this as a gift and it appears to be exactly what I was looking for.  Who doesn't like the godfather?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an excellent game. There are a variety of levels. I especially like the rooms that keep you on toes because you have to think &quot;out side of the box.&quot;
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I have enjoyed many James Bond books and films over the years. I must admit that my decision to read this book was out of a sense of duty. As a big fan of James Bond, I felt it was somehow blasphemous not to read a story about Ian Fleming, James Bond’s creator. It felt like enjoying life and refusing to read something about the Creator of life. However, as I read the book the sense of duty was replaced by enjoyment.<br /><br />I don’t think that when Ian Fleming Created James Bond he ever imagined that someone would one day create a character called Ian Fleming to rival James Bond. This is a must read for all those who like espionage stories, war stories and historical fiction. The book takes us back to wartime Britain. Damian Stevenson doesn’t tell the story, he shows you the story; he makes you feel the wartime adrenaline. The author not only showed his skills as a writer but also as a researcher. As I read the book, I sometimes forgot that the main character wasn’t James Bond but rather James Bond’s creator, Fleming. If there is a sequel to this book, I will be one of the first to read it. So often authors rush to release sequels to successful books and I advise Damian Stevenson not to rush the next book in this series. He must maintain this high standard. He has spoiled us with this masterpiece and we won’t take anything of lesser quality in the Fleming series.<br /><br />Ian Fleming the novel character has rivaled James Bond in books. Will Ian Fleming the fictional character rival James Bond in movies? Time will tell.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|great book, although the ending was a little strange but all in all it was a very good read. Good  luck
0736083863|5.0|The best book I've seen that illustrates the musculature and active positions for classical Pilates.  Beautifully drawn and organized. Highly recommended.
B00BSW6F26|2.0|boring and not at all like Big Fish games. I got stuck and gave up. Would not buy this game. Get Big Fish games instead.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't decide between liking and disliking these characters, but I also couldn't put it down. I very smart and well written novel. I predict this will become a blockbuster movie deal.
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman is one of the most interesting storytellers of our time. From his award winning Sandman comic book series to his award winning novels like American Gods he has shown an amazing ability to look beneath the surface and give us a dream like experience of reality. His newest book The Ocean at the End of the Lane is no different. It is often hard to tell what is real and what is a dream. Or is it all a dream?<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane is, at one level, the story of the narrator as a seven year old boy. The novel begins as the narrator is taking a drive down memory lane after a funeral. He drives past his childhood home and then finds himself going to the home of a childhood friend. He goes around to the back and sits down. As he sits he begins to remember the events that took place when he was seven. The seven year old boy is very familiar to me. At one level he is a reconstruction of Neil Gaiman as a child. I see myself in the boy as well. I too found my friends in books and preferred their company to that of other children. Like the narrator and the author some of the first books I remember are the Narnia books by C. S. Lewis.<br /><br />The world of this seven year old is turned upside down when the man who is renting a room in their house commits suicide. This suicide wakes up something primordial. At the scene of the suicide the narrator meets Lettie Hempstock. At first Lettie seems to be nothing more than an eleven year old girl living with her mother and grandmother. These three women are far from normal. They are something larger and more powerful. By accident the narrator lets a great evil through into our world. Now, with the help of the Hempstock women he has to try and contain this evil and send it back where it came from.<br /><br />This is more than just a story of childhood fantasy. It is the story of good against evil. Of powers beyond our control invading our world and trying to turn it upside down. It is the outside world trying to rob the innocence of children. It is the story of losing something, of something being taken as we grow older. Actually it is a story of childhood fantasy. It's not the awakening to evil, it is the realization of good. Gaiman lists G. K. Chesterton as one of his childhood influences. Perhaps this quote from Chesterton's essay \\"Red Angel\\" would help illuminate this book:<br /><br />\\"Fairy tales, then, are not responsible for producing in children fear, or any of the shapes of fear; fairy tales do not give the child the idea of the evil or the ugly; that is in the child already, because it is in the world already. Fairy tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What fairy tales give the child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of bogey. The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the dragon.\\"<br /><br />This is an amazing book. I am not sure that it would be appropriate for small children. I say I am not sure, not because it is frightening. I think that this book is more than that. I think that this book is for those who need to find the belief in something bigger than themselves.rying to rob the innocence of children.

B0019IB0II|5.0|This is a remarkable book and an amazing story.  The personal reflections of a neuroscientist who has a stroke at a young age are not to be disregarded as important information about brain function even though it is not a study in controlled settings.  In fact, controlled studies could never have been able to sample and document such an occurrence.  And, in a way, the story of recovery from this injury also seems to hint at the possibility of greater psychological freedom for us all as the left brain with all its worries, time preoccupations and narrow confines of personal interest, seems to have usurped our sense of consciousness to block integrative efforts of the right brain that appears to have the ability see a far wider picture of our lives than the domineering efforts of the left brain.  I think Ms. Taylor has discovered something that needs more investigation.  Perhaps it is a source of sanity that has eluded human kind from the start.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the game combos. they are so fun and so many to choose from. great for when you're bored
0786891416|4.0|From a rather &#34;simple murder&#34; with the usual suspects...to a complex double murder and art heist.. Wow I was very glad that I stuck with it.. It had it all beautiful women, wealthy men, russians, wiseguys and &#34;romance&#34;... An enjoyable police drama.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Charger works as described. Both ports work on the iPhone. One port works with the iPad. I would recommend this product to my friends
B00BESFWBY|4.0|True stories are always a treat. Especially when the main character grows and succeeds..Gerard Butler was an engaging mentor for this young man and helped him to realize his dream...saving him on the way.<br /><br />The scenery is beautiful and the &#34;mavericks&#34; awesome.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is really fun but I wish they had the same things as the PC has. it doesn't have All the  animals or supplies :(
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Good plot.. lots of action ( thanks Tom Cruise) . Supporting actors were interesting, convincing and the dialogue was not stupid.<br />I liked the romantic tension in lieu of the jump in the sack..<br /><br />I did not get bored halfway through because it had a good plot... identifying the &#34;bad guys at the top&#34; was not that easy..
B00000J2PH|5.0|One of the best vintage folk albums ever recorded. There is a reason why Carole King's album was entered into the Library Of Congress; it is brilliant.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good game.  requires thought and putting actions together to finish levels.  not meant for someone who wants a quick and easy game
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Absolutely loving Magic 2014! A great game, and the first year I haven't purchased it on the Xbox. Why buy it there when I can play on my phone and tablet? Great job WotC, keep it up! Now we just need a MtGO app for android with the beauty of this game and it will be perfect!
B004HD61KE|5.0|Best book  yet.  Loved the history and geology lesson.  Rollins just  gets better. Recommend it to anyone that likes<br />To  combine fact with fiction.
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|Based on a book that was quite cutting edge for its time, which was 1955. We were spellbound by the acting.
B0000062Y2|3.0|I didn't care at all for this version, must preferring several London and Broadway stage versions that were filmed. I have also seen a couple of live performances. I did not like the distortions that the film producers introduced, and I never did get what was their point in the anachronisms and the poor singing voices. The technical quality was fine, though, and I believe my sister is happy with her disc.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game that makes you think and problem solve but it needs to have more levels. After finishing the 10th puzzle I was disappointed to find that there were no more additional levels! Bring more levels!
B000056NX5|5.0|This 30th annivarsary London production was performed on stage, but was staged for videorecording. It still has the minimalist sets, and time-shifting costuming of the original productions--and no fakey outdoor location shots. The voices are real singers, not hippies pretending . I had seen this on PBS, and had a VHS tape, and was very happy that I could get a DVD version.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|Accuracy is remarkable, and the real life Jim is in this movie. Great job, now I can't wait for my children to see those files as to what happened all those years ago
B00028HBKM|2.0|because of the violence, and I find Mel Gibson (the director and producer) an odious creature.  I bought it for a family member who found the film spiritual and inspiring instead; there's no accounting for taste. I hope she likes having her own copy to view anytime she wants, but I will pass on this movie now and forever.
B0063M22QO|2.0|no rhyme or reason to it. too simple, what is the goal??? seems like it is more for kindergarteners! ! !
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A series of sad, and often tragic events. Each character with their own secrets and inner demons. But I was left with too many unanswered questions about several of the characters. What happened to them? What secrets were uncovered? I felt frustrated and deflated at the end of the novel because of the uncertainty.
030789701X|5.0|This is not just a guide but a great stand alone presentation of the game. All DLCs included and a really detailed and enjoyable read.
B000LXQVA4|2.0|The title pretty sums it up. i was really excited tog et this since all the reviews are so great, but maybe we got a defective one. the bug that is clearly shown in the photo as standing up straight and being swatable, literally is flopped all the way over the edge and completely invisible to baby.<br /><br />The seat doesn't spin at all - we have to yank it super hard to get it to move a couple degrees.<br /><br />No where on their site or in product descriptions does it say what size your kid needs to be in order to reach the floor at the lowest level. It just says they need to be able to hold their head up. Our 4 m/o daughter is in the 90th percentile for height and weight (15lbs and 25&#34;) so I assumed at least one of the settings would fit her - nope! she doesn't even come close to touching the floor. We had to put 2 huge cookbooks under her in order for her to be able to bounce.<br /><br />additionally, the toys aren't that interactive. the music is either on or off, and not controlled by baby's actions, and without the other toy that just flops over, there's not much to do but bounce.... if they can reach the floor.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Smart enough for adults to enjoy and great characters for the kids.  Can't get enough of the minions! Steve Carrell is outstanding but so are all the voice characterizations. Can't wait to see the sequel.
B00CJ32S74|4.0|I was looking to purchase a single from this movie sound track album but in error purchased the entire album.  If you have a small ear toward the music from the era this music heralds I recommend you purchase.  I've listened to this album three or four times since I've purchased.  Hope you like it as much as I do.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Good game and great graphics!  Wish it was easier to upgrade troops but good game none the less would recommend.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|As a huge fan or the original Wizard of Oz, I was happy to see this prequel was so well done. The writing is great, excellent plot, fills in some info you didn't know in the previous movie, and has plenty of action, drama, etc. I highly recommend this film.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|No online multiplayer is a drag.  Single player is ok but not worth $10.  I wish I'd bought th  pc version which seems to have multiplayer.
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|The movie stopped approximately every 3 minutes for 10 seconds or so. When the computer battery died unexpectedly, we could never get it to resume playing or even to start over even though it says we rented the movie for 24hrs. VERY LAME!!!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|When you read this book it gets right into the action. You won't have to read to the middle of the book before you get to an interesting part it starts off on the first couple of pages!!!!!!
145210655X|5.0|This was a Father's day present to my husband who is a starwars geek. He loved them and it provided laughs within the house.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is one of the best games I have downloaded. my whole family plays this game and enjoys it. fun game
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is a Great story. Don't want to give any spoilers, so I am just saying this book is phenomenal.
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|This CD made me feel that i was there for the concert. Having Hugh Jackman sing on it was even more special. Richard Marx's vocals just keep getting better and better. Loved it.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|This show is light fun without being stupid, and lots of good eye candy.  This show is totally worth watching.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Its a great game but it requires too much storage. I had to delete every app on my kindle and there is still not enough space. Otherwise its a great game and I recommend it to people who like shooting games
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good movie with lots of twists and turns. I was also impressed with the acting of the kids.
B004PHE9F6|4.0|I liked this movie when I saw it as a teenager & liked it even better! If you have surround sound, turn it up for the race scenes & you feel as if you are in Europe at the Formula One races. The director did some different technical effects that were interesting. Loved the way that you feel as if you are actually in the race car with the driver. Interesting point is that James Garner did some of the driving himself. If you like car racing, you will like this movie!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I already have Sudoku 10,000 plus...and was happy to see this Sudoku App. It has several variations and skill level choices. I'm addicted to both of my Sudoku Apps & was extremely happy that it was Free App of the Day
B002R88G5E|5.0|Hosseini has an absolute genius for telling a story and I found A Thousand Splendid Suns even more riveting than The Kite Runner.  The background of the story, with its theme of treatment of women in Afghanistan set against the political situation there and in Pakistan, was eye-opening and thought-provoking.  A very moving story.
B00C7NKPPS|4.0|When getting the long anticipated Wings Over America (standard edition) I couldn't wait to put it in the CD player and cruise around listening to it in my car.  Cranking up songs like Venus and Mars (Rock Show), Medicine Jar, Band on the Run and the one hit produced by this record, Maybe I'm Amazed.  I was not disappointed.  What I was disappointed in was the packaging.  Just a cardboard folder.  And the fact that the digital information was not burned onto the cd.  I couldn't look up the info on my CD player about the song that was playing.  Other than that...I was blasted back to the 70's with a lot of memories.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|McCartney was recoiling over the loss of the Beatles, the break in friendship with John, the competition with Yoko's presence, and the teasing he always had over his love of wealthy and powerful folks and stardom.  Yet, he took all of that in stride and made up a band and went out and played his heart out.  The love of his life standing next to him on stage, this is Paul at his absolute happiest moments.  He is letting out his pure talent in his voice and bass playing and his experience and genius in the arrangements and leaving it on the stage for the audience to decide, a true musical performance.  I saw this show and it was remarkable for everyone from Beatles fan getting to see one of them on stage playing live to musical critics who were assessing whether or not the part was equal with the whole.  The answer from everyone was &#34;Yes, more please.&#34;  Watch the starkness of the band and the overwhelming quality of Paul's talent at it stitches together all of the elements and makes Wings Over America an experience not to miss.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The best part is not having instructions and having to figure it out yourself. That's actually the whole point because if there were instructions there would be no game. Love this game but took off one star because it definitely needs more than just 10 rounds because it's way too short!
020530902X|5.0|Nothing can make you a better writer in less time or with fewer lessons than this incredible book.  The additions to it are not needed and may even distract a bit but the essence is there.  You may always wonder why Englishmen choose exactly the right word while we club language like a heavy sack.  First, it is their language and second, they have teachers who know how to explain how to use the language for something other than simple labeling, they teach you how to speak and write.  The best next thing is having this perennial favorite in your writing and thinking tool set.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Thoughtful, engaging characters that you learn to love, plots twists at every turn- this is why I love John Grisham!!
B00A27X972|5.0|This book is so different, the story original . I loved it. Fast read, the characters , the advice.All good. I can not  wait to see what the author comes up with next. It think he could make a sequel. Also the whole time I was reading, I was thinking I could totally see this as a movie.
B003F3NDOO|5.0|When I first heard of this I thought that doesn't even sound good. Then one day a couple diff shows I watch talked about it and how great it was and later there really wasn't anything on tv so I flipped it over and watched an episode and absolutely loved it! It wasn't anything like I thought it would be and there was a marathon going on that day so I watched all day. It took a little while for me to figure out who everyone was because I started in the middle of the second season but even taking that into account it was still so good that I immediately ordered the first season unseen.
B0057VY45O|5.0|Hidden gem,,,good acting, well written when they stick to court cases it's overall good!,,,,,can't wait for season three!,,,again a hidden gem
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am in love with this book.  Although some parts drag on it eventually will end.  But the next story line leads into something new. Will be finishing the rest.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Way fun for the whole family! Some memorable moments like &#34;knocked over!&#34; , and &#34;it's SO FLUFFY!&#34;. The next one is even better!
0061122416|5.0|Speedy shipping! Brand new book! As stated in description. Thanks! We got it as a gift this year for Father's Day from one of our kids. It was in superb condition!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|La fa da this game is awesome u should try it out this is the 2nd. Pouplaur game out there to me
B0063IH60K|4.0|Is an entertaining way to kill time.  Easy to play.  An electronic version of an old favorite.  If you like to play Solitaire, give it a try.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like kindle for android because it makes an already convenient platform way more portable.  I would recommended it to my friends and family
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love that i get the full experience of my account just as if i was on a laptop or desk top
B00APYKXFS|4.0|This is an extremely high adrenalin rush type of shoot'em up game. It's similar to the 80s arcade games but much much much faster pace.  The trick is to watch the red blocks forming around you. They always leave you an opening to squeeze through.<br /><br />But, there seems to be a major bug in that after staying alive for about a minute or two, I then became invincible. I continued to play for 20 more minutes, which is impossible really, because living 3 minutes, when it's not buggy, is more of a miracle than skill.<br /><br />Then, just before I decided to quit, it crashed on me.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|i like that i get  the full experience as on my laptop or desk top ..unlike what i hear others complaining about how they are missing some functions when they use the other  version
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I thought this was a very good movie for its genre. Singing, college life, humor. It has good pacing. I've watched it 3 or 4 times without getting bored. The funny moments are very funny and the singing is great. I only did not rate it as 5 stars because it was not a very deep movie; maybe barely grazing serious moments, but not really. There were many entirely accurate depictions of college life writ upon in humorous ways (i.e., college roommates). Overall, a good comedy
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I loved this movie when I first saw it. Interesting storyline and action. And awesome action of beating some Nazi a**!!!
0316035904|5.0|to buy all of amy and david sedaris's books. they are both so funny. honoured to have them on my bookshelf.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Great book everyone who enjoyed the Percy Jackson and the Olympian series would really enjoy this book if you like adventure you would enjoy this book too.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|This CD is wonderful. The song selections are great, and the voice is just as good if not better than it was when she sang with ABBA. Adult contemporary, easy to listen to, just an overall very nice collection of songs. I only wish it was a little longer (only 10 songs). Any ABBA fan will love this, and even those who don't know her will enjoy the easy-feel, &#34;lost-love&#34; mood of the songs. I've been playing it in my car for the last few weeks and am still not tired of it!
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|Easy to set up, took about half an hour to master the moves for my tv/dvd and enjoy using it. My granddaughter now calls me a Fairy Grandmother! Just pure fun.
B001JYEMOQ|4.0|Loved this movie.  Although there were some predictable moments, which I dislike in movies, overall, I find this movie to have good re-watchable status.  I hadn't seen it in a long time, but when it came on TV, enjoyed it just the same again.  I love the character development and the secret yearning that drives his inner evil to be expressed when he cannot have what he wants.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|This is exactly what it says. The Matrix Collection on 4 discs. Each movie on it's own disc plus the Animatrix on it's own disc as well. This is just the movies inside a single case, the holder in the middle is deeper to accommodate all four discs at once, stacked on top of each other. I bought this to have all the movies combined and to save space on my shelf. This was perfect for the price and I'd recommend it if you're not looking for something flashy or with more features.
0143123173|3.0|Three years after his wife's death, Walt Longmire is look forward to possible retirement.  However, if you ask Vik, his transplant from Philly, he really hasn't been present the last three years.  Whether for good or ill, that all changes when the body of Cody Pritchard is found on BLM land by sheep herders.  After the body had been munched by the animals, s*** and pissed on by the sheep, and exposed to the elements, it seemed rather hard to rule it as anything but a hunting accident.  However, after close inspection, they discover Cody was shot with a Sharps Buffalo Rifle, which is a collectible antique.  In addition, an eagle feather was left on the body.  Since Cody was part of a group of boys that raped a Cheyenne girl, Walt wonders whether this murder traces back to the reservation and the girl's relatives.<br /><br />Walt is in a race against time to find the perp and save the remaining boys from the same fate.  However, even though he is a good sheriff, he struggles with the fact that the boys got off with hardly a slap on the wrist.  And there isn't a person in town, including his best friend, who wouldn't have wanted the boys dead.<br /><br />This was a very interesting start to the series.  I wasn't expecting it the tackle such a huge issue as the rape of a girl with fetal alcohol syndrome.  Further, the hatred of the boys in the town and on the Rez was another big issue to deal with.  Honestly, the author did a good job in handling it.<br /><br />Walt is a really good, down-to-earth character.  For me, he really seemed like an \\"every man\\" in a lot of ways.  He has been the sheriff of a small town for a long time, dealing with the death of his wife, and his daughter lives across the country.  Even though he went to school in California and served in Vietnam, he is still a small town man.  And, to be honest, that is what I like about him.  The author did a wonderful job of capturing the Wyoming native/cowboy.  It was obvious he knew his stuff and was very familiar with the lifestyle out here.<br /><br />Aside from Walt, Henry practically made the book.  Their relationship, friendly bantering, and Henry's diction had me continue reading.  He is marvelously hilarious!  Plus, it takes a saint to be able to put up with Walt the way he does.  I cannot wait to see more of this character.<br /><br />The storyline was definitely engaging, and it took me by surprise when we finally find out the identity of the perp.  That being said, I felt it was too loose a fit for who it turns out to be.  Without giving anything away, it is really hard to discuss.  Also, even though the spiritual elements were interesting in relation to the Sharps Buffalo Rifle, it seemed to come out of the blue and rather extraneous while Walt is trying to save George and Henry.  I found myself skipping large sections of text because it just drug on.  Plus, it felt as though Walt was tripping on some heavy narcotics.  And, because it's my biggest pet peeve, there were editing issues.  It didn't distract from the book, but another round of editing would have helped.<br /><br />After listening to Craig Johnson speak and watching Longmire, I am very curious to see how the series progresses.  It is wonderful to read a book about the state I grew up in and will always love as my home!  He is able to really capture the beauty, magic, and lifestyle of Wyo., and that is refreshing.le out here.    Aside from Walt, Henry practically made the book.

B003NS1JHY|1.0|This film tried to take what was a one hour, weekly TV show and try to stretch it into a full length film.  Boring and overdone.
B005IDXIL2|5.0|It is a lot of fun to play this game and you can play against someone else if you are waiting with another person.
B001EBV0NU|1.0|If this film was supposed to be funny... well, it missed that mark by a MILE!!!  A very tedious, boring film.  And I'm sad to see that such a great talent as Rod Steiger was associated with this film.  What a shame, considering his powerful performances in his past films (such as Pawnbroker!).
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Much better than Tate's attempt at a Queensryche record.  Continuity.  The deluxe pack is a bit bulky but you can fit Tate album in the box together.  This way you'll always have both on hand to compare side by side.  Tate should go in a different direction.  He way a great singer.  Now he's a really good singer who's range just isn't there anymore but still better than most guys his age.<br />I actually think its the best album since empire.  Can't wait for another to see if they can continue in this direction.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is an excellent quality game.  The idea is novel plus the game play is to notch.  This is an excellent version of the pyramid solitaire game. I love all of the extras like having to clear the water hazards.  Big Fish Games have a winner on their hands.  I used to have this on the iPad but am thrilled to finally have it available on my Kindle Fire HD.  Get this game!!
B008LVCKH6|4.0|History mixed with a good dose of humour, worth the effort! I enjoyed the way facts and fiction where mixed into a plausible story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just think of each level of this game like it's own Myst mini game.  You have to figure out how to get the door open on each level.  However, instead of this being frustratingly impossible like the 99 Doors game, this is fun.  It is challenging without being overly frustrating.  Very high quality graphics as well.  Very highly recommend!!
1608199096|4.0|This is a beautiful book, well illustrated and well put together.  The recipes are very simple but of course as I live in the Caribbean it is difficult to get the right ingredients so I have to improvise.  I like having this recipe book in my collection.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|First, a piece in the NYT magazine about author Max Brooks, son of Mel Brooks and Ann Bancroft (may have something to do with the publicity and favorable reviews).  Then, a movie coming out starring Brad Pitt.  Then, a Kindle special on the book. Ta da! From what I've read about the movie, it is only loosely based on this book, and all they have in common is zombies.  Plot and characters are different in the movie.  The book is boring, boring , boring, and most 15 year olds could easily beat Mr Brook's lame attempts at social commentary.  Awful.
B00633PFQC|4.0|Sandel does a good job in highlighting the areas where creeping commercialization feels wrong, or creepy, or crass. He relates the limits as first a lack of efficiency, but more so a corruption of the public and common areas of our lives.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the twists she made(Suzanne) made the book a whole lot better than expected. Definetly want to share this with others
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great game. Never had any problems with it. Just match the cubes and they &#34;pop&#34;. I like the popping sound they make. Great mind numbing, time killing game.
1781162646|5.0|This is a little different than his earlier stuff but still very good. Kept me on the edge of my seat, as usual.
B00992CF6W|1.0|So far, paying 6.99 was a waste of money. I am unable to download this ap to my devices after purchase. Kurio tablet and Android phone. Amazon assistance didn't work.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|3-D view of the Grand Canyon is totally fabulous. Seriously felt like we were right there. The story behind the DVD is sad, because of a BIG water dam, the river suffers, has become overgrown with trees, bushes, grasses. We didn't know this problem existed. The view of this national park is tremendously heart-warming.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I like it very much - can't wait to get season 2 when it becomes available.  Hope the series continues on tv.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|Wonderful seeing the inside/outside of space &#34;housing&#34;. Enjoyed the anti-gravity spectacular when shown what water does in space as well as how they must dress to go outside and perform repairs. Very informative!
B008OOYALE|2.0|This game was fun at first, but after you've breed a lot of dragons (I'm at 70 dragons), you start running out of possible new dragons to breed. It's so unfair that iOS users have all these special features and can breed all of these new dragons coming out while android users can't. I play Dragon Story every day and I've only bred one new dragon after many weeks of daily play. Without the special features iOS users have, this game gets too slow. It's a lot of work for very little satisfaction. Dragonvale is better because once you have enough gems for an epic breeding island, you can breed 2 pairs of dragons at once! I've been getting a new dragon every couple of days! Plus, it is easier to make money and there are more decorations to choose from. But sadly, the Dragonvale newest version is not compatible with Kindle Fire at the moment, leaving me a very sad dragon breeder.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|Excellent colors, dimensions, terrific artistry, funny characters, and story exposed bird smuggling. Grandchildren and grandparents enjoyed Rio! You won't be disappointed!
0525953728|5.0|I haven't read a book in years but this one made up for it. Was not able to put it down until I finished.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|We had seen this in the theater and promised we'd buy it as it will/is just as fabulous seeing it in the comforts of home.<br />Rough, tough, slam-bam antics, reserved humor, and detailed scenes. Some of the story is difficult to watch but is not gory. Bruce Willis shows his comical side in every &#34;Die Hard...&#34; series.
B008JTK9NW|5.0|What a great album and very powerful messages throughout. Glad that they went back to their roots and sing about God/Jesus!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Interesting to watch it on the 4th of July.  Daniel Day Lewis is, as usual, great in the lead.  I would like to read more about what in the screenplay is artistic liberty v. fact, but most of it, I believe, is correct.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Haven't finished the game yet, but have enjoyed it very much so far.  Great music and graphics.  Helpful hints should you get stuck.<br />Puzzles and HO's which challenge but don't throw you over the edge to figure out.  Should you have a hard time there is the hint button.  Using on my Kindle Fire HD with no problems or glitches thus far.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If anyone wanted the new update for the kindle fire, and you knew about it just don't play minecraft until the update is actually on you device. I did that and I got new spawn eggs and everything! Don't play minecraft when update 7 comes out soon. I heard they have mods that pc and Mac have. I hope Yahoo guys found this helpful. Also if want to download any maps any one uploads you can in update 7. I heard this from some people at game stop. I hope every one gets the updates!
B00CW665VI|5.0|First off this book is funny... laugh my ass off funny. This book is done in the POV of the main guy character Drew. His witty banter and inter dialogue had me laughing so hard. This was great romantic comedy and I loved it. Has some Great hot steamy love scenes. Great book!
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|This was a gift for my brother-in-law on his birthday. The quality of the books is great and it's the best quality online in comparison to the prices listed of the entire series of books. I highly recommend it.
B00APYKXFS|3.0|I think I'm being generous with 3 stars.  The game has great potential but the game play is somewhat confusing and would probably be much better with a tutorial.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite Jillian Michaels workout DVDs. I have used it and it certainly kicked my ass and I have also seen results!! Highly recommended!
B002ZG976U|5.0|I loved the music and dancing.  Christina's numbers were great, moves, makeup and costumes.  The story line is pretty standard but it had a very nice twist at the end.  Cher isn't what she used to be and her 2nd song could have been cut without any harm to the story line.  But overall, I think it is great.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it but if. You could go to the neather and the ended and all that good stud. So its alright.
B005WMADYE|5.0|I first heard about Redline from a video series called &#34;Reaction & Review.&#34; The person in the video described the animation as beautiful and that the action is almost nonstop, and it was. Redline is condensed awesome from start to finish. The only truly bad thing is that it had to end.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|it is awesome best shark game ever when I reach my goal I feel great getting new sharks. especially the great -white and the Meglodon. in other words its great.
B008602KQI|5.0|When I first heard about this story I thought it sounded weird, but I saw the movie and loved it.  Then I read the book and have since watched the movie a couple more times.  I think its a good adaptation of the book.  I didn't love the 2nd and third books as much.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This kid is sneaking game time on every device we own. If I allow the kindle on the throne her but falls asleep and I have to pry her off.
B002SR2PKG|4.0|Make no mistake, I loved It. I was enthralled from the second I picked it up, and couldn't put it down all day. I didn't think it was too long, but I am a quick reader and finished it in a day.  I liked the ending as well, and my only complaint is the love and desire part. If something I read in a book shocks me so much I am completely snapped out of it and looking at it in horror instead of experiencing it, then it has to be bad. I am not talking about the good kind of horror, that I like when I read Stephan King's book, but the &#34;Ew gross, why would someone even imagine this about 11 year children&#34; type horror. I would still advise you to get this book, it is an excellent one, and I am glad I read it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Especially good because the younger kids have a better chance of winning. Great for short trips when kids need to be quiet.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it!! My husband and I really enjoyed it! It was challenging and frustrating enough to keep us going. Pretty disappointed when the game was over. More levels please!!!!
B00B4804KS|5.0|I'm always a little skeptical about post 3d conversions, but this impressed in many ways. The family watched this with our Epson3010  3d projector and Sony 7.1 amplifier and was totally blown away. Yes there are age-related limitations of the material, but by far and wide its looks nearly brand new. The 3d depth effect is evident through most of the movie, and pop-out effects are used for some fun 'gotcha' moments with the critters. The soundscape is beautifully used and the 7.1 environment really immerses you into the sounds of the island. I won't go into 'banding', 'crosstalk', 'color reproduction' issues because I feel that many reviews on these topics often involve users of equipment most of us can't afford and there's no guarantee that its been properly configured either.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|This CD is  the most inspiration metal music put out within the last year, hands down. ABR has done it again.
B000SC245E|4.0|I have no complaints that I had to order this because of all the pages I print each and every month which is approximately 5,000 and sometimes 10,000 pages.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I always loved the movie Ice Age and the game is really cool by the Melt Down cuz you get to help the animals in the movie.
B000SE0OYA|4.0|I had to buy this for my Brother MFC-8480DN Printer because I print many, many, many pages every month because I do real estate closings all the time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The best game ever! Very challenging. Worth the time playing and waiting. This game will entertain you for hours. Play it.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This Is A Fun Game  But It Takes 10 Minutes To Load A Level And Often Locks Up While Loading A Level On Droid RAZR
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|This is a great album.  Not only is the music complex and interesting, but the lyrics really set it apart in the metalcore genre.  In my opinion, this is one of the best metal albums released in the past few years.  A lot of long-time fans are taking the &#34;I like their old-stuff better&#34; road.  We get it.  You've been listening to them for years.  Take it from someone who hasn't really been a super fan over the years... this one's good.
B004UPAIDK|1.0|Iit is really a bad movie. Ddont waste your money and time to watch this movie. It is really a stupid mivie
B009AMANH4|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much.  It was a little slow and I lost my concentration a few times but historically was wonderful.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can You Escape is very addictive! The puzzles are quite challenging and you definitely need to use your memory for this. I'll admit I had to cheat a few times and get some hints but then you still have to try to remember the entire order because when you leave the game the level resets. Overall a good game!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|How can an album so fantastic have been unknown to most Americans all these years? I wonder. This album has become on of my favorites very quickly. After watching Searching for Sugar Man, I was introduced to Rodriguez. This is an album you can listen to once and absolutely love it. You know how it is when you listen to a new album and it's OK but it's not immediately one of your favorites? And even after listening to it from start to finish many times over, it's still just OK. That's not this album. So nice to find a gem like this and even though it was released several decades ago, it's holds up very well. You will not be disappointed after buying this album. So happy for Rodriguez and his family that he found an audience for his music and so glad I found it. My favorite songs are I Wonder and Sugar Man.
1451695195|3.0|The book was boring--too much medical terminology.  Very repetitive.  The book could have been a short story instead of an entire book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome applicatoin. Graphics are so life like- fun for kids of all ages.  If you know anything about horses you will love the game - if as a kid you ever wanted a horse and your parents said no because it was to much responsibility this game will give you a whole different appreciation for horse owners.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|I went into this film with zero expectations and loved it. I am up for another viewing of this I think, and found myself having a lot of fun with this movie. Quite the surprise. I loved it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|We love playing this and racing to see who finishes first. We are a family of many game players. Thank you.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love the series. This is my fourth time reading the books. They are that good. Each time through I notice details I missed before. Can't wait for WoW to be released!
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|ON THE THIRD WORLD I KEEP ON FALLING IN A PIT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE LEVEL! MAN THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I was skeptical at first of this diet approach, but after reading it and trying it, it really works!  Easiest diet I have ever done and it has really helped me think about what I am eating on the off days.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Excellent story. It showcases the detective observing and analyzing every detail, as he should! Excellent purchase at the Kindle price!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|More intense than anticipated .... Love story between two ill-adjusted people.  Not a happy film at all and not what you would call entertaining. Not sure why it did cost 4.99 instead of usual 3.99.  Do not need to watch again.
0765348276|4.0|There's a great premise here: at 75, people living on Earth can optionally enlist in the Colonial Defence Force, get some advanced medical treatment, and hop on a one-way flight into space to defend far-flung human colonies. Sclazi writes a ripping military Sci-Fi space opera, with significant influence from Starship Troopers and The Forever War, but with less moral, political, and thematic depth and more fast-paced action. That may be good or bad depending on your point of view.<br /><br />That's not to say the characters are shallow, Perry is well-rounded, intelligent, and desperately misses his wife, who dies a number of years before he joins the CDF.<br /><br />\\"For as much as I hate the cemetary, I've been grateful it's here, too. I miss my wife. It's easier to miss her at a cemetary, where she's never been anything but dead, than to miss her in all the places where she was alive.\\"<br /><br />\\"The problem with aging is not that it's one damn thing after another - it's every damn thing, all at once, all the time.\\"<br /><br />The medical treatment, it's outcomes, and the old people's reactions to their new fitness was fascinating reading. The BrianPals felt a lot like Google Glass plus 20 years.<br /><br />I hated the section with Master Sergeant Ruiz as the cliched drill instructor. Scalzi acknowledged that he was writing a cliche drill instructor and tries to address it head on:<br /><br />\\"You're under the impression that I'm talking like this because this is just something drill instructors are supposed to do. You're under the impression that after a few weeks of training, my gruff but fair facade will begin to slip and I will show some inkling of being impressed with the lot of you, and that at the end of your training, you'll have earned my grudging respect...You're impression, ladies and gentlemen, is completely and irrevocably f***ed.\\"<br /><br />But the scenario described is exactly what happens.<br /><br />Battles are had, aliens and humans die in creative ways, and it's all very entertaining (the Consu reminded me of Dr. Who's Sontarans in their war-like temperament). However, the human-led massacre of Lilliputian aliens is ridiculous (stomping? really? even today's weapons could easily destroy a tiny city more efficiently) and a bizarre way to introduce Perry's moral conflict.<br /><br />All that aside, it is a great thriller which is impossible to put down. That's so rare I'm willing to forgive much.<br /><br />4.5 stars<br /><br />Read more of my reviews at g-readinglist.blogspot.com
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really fun. There are two modes creative and survival. THIS IS APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN 7+. It is like real life only in blocks. It is the portable version of minecraft PC edition. I strongly and highly recommend this game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent series!!!  I watched the first episode of Season 1 a few weeks ago and was hooked.  Within three weeks I have watched all of Seasons 1-3 and cannot wait until Season 4 comes on this fall.  Great value @ $14.99 for 9 episodes.
0800141660|3.0|I have watched both the BBC mini-series version and the movie. Although it pales in comparison to the  BBC Masterpiece version, as movie, it is one of the better big screen adaptations of Jane Austen's work.  Although Emma Thompson did a decent job with the screen play, i don't like the fact that she made a concerted effort to model  Edward Ferrars' personality around Hugh Grant's celebrity persona. Emma Thompson was 37 when this movie was released and she looks great, but she would have been better suited for the role of Mrs Dashwood. I don't understand why they made the decision to cast her as 19 year old Elinor, she just doesn't pull it off, and i found it distracting. If you are an Austin purist, and you haven't watched either version, my advice would be......start with the movie. If you watch Masterpiece first, you will have a difficult time enjoying the movie
B00C061I3K|5.0|Funkiest music that touches the soul. Crack in audio form. Daft punk continues to evolve their music into an artform.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|As always it is fun to go back and watch the original series of movies.  Lots of fun on a rainy night with popcorn.
0525952926|4.0|What I liked about \\"Winter of the World\\" is that instead of talking about WWII episodes that everybody knows, it explains unfamiliar events that are still quite obscure to many of us.<br /><br />Great storytelling. Character development is a little bit in the background. The historical events are so compelling that is quite a challenge to get too much involved with the characters. As with \\"Fall of Giants\\", there is a fair amount of coincidences that were hard to swallow. But that didn't bother me too much. I got used to.<br /><br />\\"Fall of Giants\\" should be read prior to this one.
B009GX6TMA|5.0|I'm not sure why I never bothered to watch this show since I'm a fan of Zooey Deschanel but all that has changed now. I love this show and can not help but channel my mothers guffaw style laugh several times throughout each episode. :)
B00969PR18|5.0|If there was a Map for idiots, this is it I cannot read maps if my life depended on it.  I downloaded this free APP I became a savant all I have to do is put in the address I'm looking for and the map show me point by point how to get there I mean literally it points in COLOR the route I need to take to get to my destination how fun and easy this is AMAZING.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|You Tube sensations turned serious performers, &#34;The Piano Guys&#34; serve up another album of classical approaches to music often with a tech element. If you've sat  through piano and cello concerts before and later wonder why, these guys will have you sitting back enjoying every moment. Best, they combine old styles, drumming on the cello with high tech electronic effects. What genius.
B00D1DBO1C|3.0|I'm still learning how to use this new app. So far it is not to bad, I get easily distracted I will add more eventually.
B005C9YZIM|5.0|I LOVE PLANET EARTH. If you like nature at all this is awesome. Amazing visuals and narration. Wish there were endless discs cause i've watched all of them about a million times. AWESOME.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very large screen, easy to use I use it at work at home or at the store.  Very good product for free. Thanks
B007FEFLTO|5.0|He certainly did his research.  I can't wait for the next one.  If you want to learn about the normal day to day lives of the people before, during an after WWII this is the book. Obviously, it's a fictional account but historical figures do appear and do and say what they did and said.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very easy to use, you able to get to the chapter and verses needed very quickly work offline very well with options to change font size. Get me into reading my Bible again.
B0041VV03A|4.0|I really liked this movie because of its concept... It shows the sick and confused mind of those playing God
B002FOQY2M|5.0|Fun is an awesome band! This cd is a little different, but if you like Fun, you'll enjoy it! I'm a huge huge fan!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was an amazing book. it should teach everyone to like someone for who they are not what they look like. Read this book and when you finish take sometime to think about it. IT taught me a huge lesson
B006M4RN3U|5.0|These cd has they're 3 #1 hits & the rest of the record is absolutely awesome! I'm such a big fan of Nate, Andrew, & Jack!
B009S33I68|4.0|A first rate view about realities of combat in Vietmam.  Not for light reading.  Very detailed, reminds me of the PBS series &#34;The Civil War&#34;.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|similar to 100 floors but WAY better! Creative ,challenging,yet you still have chance to figure it out with out using cheats.Clever puzzles and funny to look at rooms.really enjoyed this game
B0092S4WLY|3.0|fun game like 100 floors.  I just hope it doesn't end at level 10 like room escape.<br />now I need more words so here they are blab blab blab
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Only tiny hiccup was that I received the UK version instead of US, but really not a big deal. I gave it as a gift to my Finace for her birthday and she and I both love it! Thanks!
1476715904|5.0|This is one of those books you can't put down, stop reading, or walk away from. The characters in the book are so easy to fall in love with, the story is different from anything I've read before and is just plain entertaining! It normally takes me a couple of weeks to finish a book because I work 2 jobs, but I finished this in two days! I can't wait to read the sequel, Point of No Retreat. Loved this book!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My granddaughter and I played this together and had so much fun ! Bring on the next levels. We are ready to play more.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It wasn't a poorly written book, but it just wasn't very interesting. I never cared about any of the characters, I just kept slogging through to the end hoping it would redeem itself. It didn't.
B0031R5K68|5.0|Like any of Dan Brown books it have another mystery when you think you have solved it. Love his books
B00CWY76CC|3.0|There are basically no instructions so it took a little bit to figure out what to do. Once I figured it out the game was really fun, then it ended after only 10 levels. I was able to play for about 20 minutes before I beat every level. Glad it was free.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Nesbo is a fine writer and spinner of a tale. This novel is several cuts above the average crime mystery and left me anxious to read his next book.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|i thought it wasjust perfect the picture ,the sound every thing!!! i love NCIS watch every episode over and over !!!
B004HWYTP4|3.0|It sort of drags at the end but some liked it. Watch it just for fun and what a cast.
B008MM9630|4.0|I love this game because you don't need neighbors to help you get through quests and leveling up.  I also like how it turns from day to night to show the passage of time.
B004DM0UII|1.0|Used to be good.  Now too many ads.  If you need to rebuffer like use in a car the ads replay over and over.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book is about the same caliber of a 6th grade bible study class.  There is no proof of heaven in this book, just a childlike perception of &#34;simple dressed peasent style&#34; people sitting about and singing.  Angels are flying about while the doctor tours heaven riding on the wing of a butterfly with a beautiful young girl.  Sounds like Timothy Leary.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Perfect for a rainy Sunday with the family. A must see before Red 2 in the coming months!!<br /><br />We can't wait!
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|Can't say enough about the series - loved it then and love it now.<br /><br />I got a great deal on this complete series, but I have a bad DVD (Disk 3 of Season 2), and Amazon hasn't bothered responding to my concern.  I've noticed other reviewers with bad disks, and guess that they too are out of luck.  With 93 shows/movies, it can take some time to watch them all.  I received this set in April, and am on Season 4 right now, but it could be several more months before I complete the entire set.  Am I supposed to watch it all within the first month to make sure there aren't any issues?  Amazon - how about replying to me now and make this right?  It's just not fair that I am stuck with a defective set.<br /><br />Problem fixed - check my comment below
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun if your into this kind of thing. Take your time and look for clues. My wife and love to play together.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|An all star cast in this take on an old horror soap opera from the sixties (that I truly didn't even like) makes a hilarious and very entertaining movie.  I didn't go to the theater to see this thinking I wouldn't like it.  Saw it on HBO and between Depp and the rest of the talented actors and the music, I absolutely loved it and had to buy a copy.  Even if you never saw the original show, there's enough plot and character building that you'll know all about the Collins family and their dark shadows.  Enjoy!
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Tolle's thoughts are usually insightful with the potential for being life changing .  In this book he reaches a new level of saying only what is most important for us to ponder.
0767836324|5.0|Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams--worth every penny to see these two great actors in any film. This interesting take on Peter Pan once he eventually grew up but Neverland stayed the same makes for a really great story.  Even my grandchildren loved this movie.  The acting is superb, the premise is interesting and it's not animated.  Out of all the Peter Pan live action movies, this is my favorite.  Gave away my VHS copy and bought it in DVD.
B001XUKFAQ|2.0|We could not even watch half of this movie due to buffering the whole entire time!!! Thought it was my connection speed but it was fine. Watched Thor on prime (free) and had no issues. Guess I just wasted $3.99 on a rental. Hopefully will not have the same issue when I decide to rent a movie again. Otherwise the actual movie is awesome and very funny!
B00005RDRO|5.0|Great case of a group of famous detectives who are invited to solve a mystery at the home of Lionel Twain (get the play on words?).  An ensemble cast of vintage actors who never fail to make me laugh.  Written by Neil Simon it's completely hilarious, non-violent and completely entertaining.
B008N9AAQ4|1.0|Granted that this Blue-ray has extremely Hi-Def stunning shots of places around the planet. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing where they are from. Some subtitles of the segments displayed at the beginning of the segment would have been nice. The real problem is the horrific scenes of chicken processing that made us stop watching. It turns out there is also segments of pig processing. Not something I want to see, especially in Hi-Def! We will never watch this again and I have decided to throw the dick out so I do not ever even see the box again!
B001L51RQE|4.0|If you like Sting or The Police, this is a must in your DVD collection.  Good sound, good video, good quality.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun to play and great for kids. I recommend this for anyone who wants their kids to have a fun game to play or is really bored.
B000059TFO|4.0|It was not the FBI that located the bodies of the 3 workers, it was mob man Gregory Scarpa Sr. who kidnapped, pistol whipped, tortured a small town mayor and klansman, and after threatening to cut off his penis with a straight razor gave up the location of the bodies. This was never discussed in the film, as Scarpa was an informant of the FBI, and they gave him a gun and cash in order to do what he did.still a good film. I just wish Hollywood would tell the truth when doing these types of films... For truth is stranger than fiction!
B00COHAUD4|5.0|It may not have many true scares but it's the first horror film I have seen in a while that made me cheer for the protagonists to win, and it actually becomes an interesting story about motherhood and adoption. Watched The Hobbit right after: had a much better time here.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of my favorite games --next to virtual families 2-- and I play this like all the time! You should definitely get this app. Its not overpriced.....
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris tells his story in vivid color.  You can actually visualize what is happening as he describes the action.  Hats off to our heros and this excellent book of first hand action.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Not the best thing King 's ever written but it remains entertaining throughout. Mile 81 is much more camp than his usual works but sets a tone similar to one of his earlier stories, The Cat From Hell.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Are we still heroes? Or are we the goats? Not sure. Bowie seems to be trying to figure that one out as well. At least he presents the question in a package that I enjoy listening to. Thanks David. It's great to hear you are still here, as well as there.
B0006Z2KIY|5.0|I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it.  My husband and I, married 11 years, and being seniors, feel this movie epitomizes our feelings for each other.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a fairly well written book but not really what I expected and I really didn't like the end. It was easy to read and kept me interested for most of it. Usually I enjoy an unexpected ending, but not this time.Oil
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a really nice to have to have a honeymoon in this blog was the phone and river trip just be home for the river and I'd rather have to be our own internet explorer.
B00821OW8K|5.0|Falling Skies is one of the best Sci-fi shows currently on TV. Almost as good as Battle star galactic. It is great it was renewed for a 4th season.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Great for single time wasting if not busy and just plain bored  but I need more rooms now to continue
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Did not expect to be impressed by this series, but I could not stop watching it! Well worth missing nap time to watch it all!
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|Usual Die hard theme. I don't know how many times Willis can play this role, but he is a his usual self in this action packed movie.<br />If you like thing blowing up and car chases than this is your movie.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Shades of the hero days and the comic book era.Action and wonder as to who is your favorite character.Stars galore came out in the day.
B00D6BQG1W|1.0|Wasn't great. Was bored through most of it. I thought it would be funnier but it wasn't. It wasn't much of anything but a waste of my time.
B001THZAAI|5.0|This movie is so funny! Even if you don't know French. I really recommend it to everyone.<br />If you know a little French this will only make you want to go back and study some more!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is a lifesaver. I use a calculator all the times and having one on my kindle is the most convenient. feature I could ask for.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great start to the series.  Fun to read after watching the tv show. Looking forward to the  rest of the series.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Great movie and star-studded cast. This is a must see by all loving souls that aspire for true love and devotion.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this game is nothing. no use to get it if it is free. the computer version also ducks. this has no diamond and gold. even if it does it would still not be good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. It was fun to find the clues and solve the room. I just wish there were more levels. Thank you!
B0049OSQ18|5.0|Portland, OR. is a creative force to be heard in the music industry.  Hauntingly unique as both the band and their home.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|What are you doing reading reviews? Go watch this movie! I mean it! I was suspicious of this movie before it came out. Comic book movies haven't been stellar of late. This one has exceeded all of my expectations. I don't want to spoil anything, though. Go watch it! You'll see what I mean.
1455508977|4.0|the book is the old one it is not the same cover otherwise i thought the book was a great book
B006QKJQM6|5.0|This was a fun, exciting and inspiring movie. It was a great family movie (I wouldn't include little ones because of all the action and defending people from the bad guys :) )<br />I don't remember any bad jokes or language at all - it was so nice to say, &#34;It was great except for….&#34; I really appreciated a movie that helps to teach good values, family, friendship, each person's importance, etc.<br />I hope we can have lots more movies like this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|phenominal, one of the best if not one of the best tv shows of all time. enough said .gotta watch it
B008XG1X18|5.0|Can't end my day without pinning. Love it all. You cant spend  five  minutes just collecting ideas whenever you have time then go back and enjoy. Amazing idea and smooth function.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|phenominal, one of the best if not one of the best tv shows of all time. enough said .gotta watch it
B00881VLCE|5.0|The very best puzzle game on the internet<br />I have tried them all and this is by far the very best.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|Very good read.  I have always been interested in Anne Frank and her life.  This had told me a lot about her and her life and the way she had to live it.  I only wish I had the chance to meet her.  But this book has done that for me.
B00D4GNN6A|5.0|I found this to be one of the few good introductory books  allowing a systematic and clear examination of it's subject. It's scholarly in tone and comprehensive providing a good context for understanding Jyotish.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|I SAW! I BOUGHT! I WATCH OVER AND OVER! A++++++++++++ in all categories!  If you haven't seen yet, you're missin' out!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I hope they come out with another game very soon. I finished this room in about an hour and a half. It was tricky but fun.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|this is the best game ever!! never have I image the most awesome game ever. you should get this game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's fun and addicting and there's always more surprise plays and bonuses to explore and receive.I would recommend it for every age which is nice to find.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|It's so easy to maneuver the players and you can choose a famous player in almost all modes. And it's so FUN!
B005UG542S|5.0|Horrible streaming video.....video didnt play all the way through. Video was constantly reloading. I have an 2012 Apple computer which is one of the best computers out there. Even with that the video was having horrible trouble playing. I have watched other videos over the internet with extreme clarity, no trouble with play at all......yet I had trouble with this Amazon video
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it, read in two days couldn't put it down.  Ready for the next one in the series. Great Write and great read.
B002NN5F7A|2.0|In spite of the all-star cast, I found this movie unwatchable.  The language is profane and I am not a prude.  It is the worst of man in a capsule.  This kind of movie reminds me of the scene in &#34;Butterflies are Free&#34; where the playwright says &#34;It's life, man!&#34;  The uptight mom character responds &#34;Young man, defecation is a part of life.  That does not mean that I wish to see it performed on stage.&#34;  Or, in this case, on screen.  I shut it off after about twenty minutes.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|easy to use-- I would recommend it to a friend or relative-works well on my not too expensive android. Image color of a landscape are realistic.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game! The only thing I don't like is the ad pop ups between games. Otherwise, it's the same tried and true solitude you know and love.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Love the whole series of books, just hadn't reviewed my Wishlist for ages and saw it was still listed.  It's all good :)
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I generally won't write reviews on movies but this one is definitely a 5 star production! Excellent cast, story line and direction by Dustin Hoffman. For those that are uncomfortable with the f-bomb, be warned, in over 50 movies that Maggie Smith has made, she debuts the use of the word (once) in this movie and it makes a hilarious impact. I am certain that was the intent and it works well.<br />This is a very well done movie that will make you both laugh and cry while watching a very sweet story unfold.
B00004W50Z|5.0|Here in our neighborhood, my friends and I were always fans of the band, as children, and as for me, there were still 5 years before I found out Todd Rundgren, who happened here was a sound engineer. In the years up to last Jubilation never changed, self-identical in all respects: the sound, the approach challenging, a few video clips. And I never could understand how critics could crush a beautiful album as Stage fright . The Band have become a sort of icon immutable and their discs seem different beads belonging to the same series. While \\"Music from Big Pink\\" and \\"The Band\\" offer the most popular songs that we have always heard, this album is more melodic and hauntingly beautiful.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I have read every Lee Child book on Reacher!  He is my favorite common hero-badass!  This was probably the best acting done by Tom Cruise in a long time!  I recommend this!
B0000AI45P|5.0|New round, new review. Marquee Moon by Television contains the famous Elevation a song that has remained little known to the general public, but it is wonderful. As for the music: guitar riffs are deceptively simple, but not like that of mild new wave pop. Then there See no evil, and classics like Marquee Moon and Friction. And even though I had heard most of these songs before, many times more than three decades ago I had never fully appreciated the lyrics. It must be said that the registration period,was the beginnings reveals a great Tom Verlaine as singer.I knew that the songs were clever, but, also, were deceptively simple. There was very new in these four chords from New York and Marquee Moon offers the usual Television.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Good action, good story, good acting!  Some up and comers in this film!  Wish I owned the DVD, would probably watch it a few more times!
B000003TAL|5.0|That Daydream Nation is a great album everyone knows, even the bees in the hive disturbed by feeedback guitars. The band is excellent with the great Kim Gordon, Lee Ranaldo, Thurstone Moore, Steve Shelley.<br />Show that one can attain ecstasy in a world of guitar orgy, noise may be dreamlike or sharp. In the recording room the musicians have spent their care and emotional comfort from producer Nick Sansano and sound engineer Matt Tritto, many things changed outside, and Sonic Youth after this work is found in the catalog of Geffen, with much more money available for the production and the distribution of future chapters. There's nothing you can really say about this album ... I mean it is one of the few rock albums to be included in the World Encyclopedia of Rock.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have a sony dslr a100, I pack a 75-300mm Telephoto Lens, 35mm wide angle, filters, Bower SFD728S Digital Autofocus Flash, back up batters, charger, tripod. it all fits safety and neatly in this bag. It is very well made and lite and carries comfortable on trips and walking in the woods too.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I haven't read a book so rich with imagery, so alive with character and so captivating in its complex and unpredictable plot since Tolkien's &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy. I first discovered Game of Thrones on HBO and loved it, but Martin's book has much more depth and detail. Things that didn't seem clear in the TV series now make sense to me. I am a professional writer and author and have high standards and I bow to Martin's ability to create a world so full of life, with characters that come alive in the telling. It's lengthy but flows easily and reads as though it were much shorter.
B0044DEAUA|2.0|I purchased this to replace an old(about 8yrs old) Supertooth Bluetooth speakerphone I have that still works but has lost battery power over the years and doesn't work quite as well as it once.  Since I had great service from the first one from Supertooth I decided to get another.  While it works, it doesn't work as well as the old one.  Also, it is very difficult to tell when it is actually on or not.  The buttons really aren't placed where I would like them.  The biggest thing I don't like about it is that the old one had two magnets which held it solidly in place on the metal bracket which fits over the visor.  The new one only has one magnet so every time I try to press a button the thing spins on it's axis and makes pushing the buttons a real hit or miss proposition.  It really sounds no better than my 8yr one either on the sending or receiving ends.The only things I can say nice about it is that a nice size and the price was right but I wouldn't buy another or recommend it.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|We were looking for something light and funny and found it here!  We rented it with Amazon for 24 hours and watched it twice.  Good deal!  We laughed as much the second time as the first.  It is SO cute!  I grew up as the youngest of 3 and I could relate to all the nonsense that goes on in sibling relationships.  We haven't seen the other Wimpy Kid movies but will consider them after seeing this one.
B00821OX98|4.0|Some parts are cheesy, but overall it is very good.  Plot keeps you guessing, and the aliens are nice and creepy.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie is very close to the book. The choice of actors was good as were the special effects. Can't wait to see the other books on film.
B004UID2LC|5.0|For all tablets that aren't supported by Google Play and as such can't download google apps such as YouTube, this is a great app. If you know what you want to see you just type it in, and can watch it, download it, or download and convert in an MP3. It's great
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had read reviews that said they thought this game was too short. I've been playing it off and on for a month or more and can see what they might mean by that. Tho I am still entertained by it. I am not &#34;advanced&#34; in this sort of game play and find it highly amusing to try to figure the next move. The hints are just right: not too helpful but helpful enough.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|It isn't all that it's cracked up to be and there are a few glitches whenever you actually try to navigate the pages. Honestly I'd forgotten I had it after the first week.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Maybe I just don't like Bingo that much, but this game is pretty boring to me. I don't like the idea that you have to spend real money on items so you can keep playing. Not what I expected.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you love Mahjong this is the game for you. Great graphics and challenging puzzels can lead to hours of gameplay or just 5 minutes of amazing play wherein upon finishing you feel like a boss.
B00190N4E4|5.0|This film does an excellent job at telling the story of the life of a beautiful, inspirational man. Everyone should watch this film at least once!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought two of these bags. I have a lower pro sling but it was not cutting it for the amount of lenses I have. I was very satisfied with the speed of the shipping as well as the quality of the bag. There were only two things I did not like : 1) No designated slot for sd cards but again something that is manageable. 2) Amazon written on every zipper..the pro about the zipper is that it is rubber so you have an easy grip on the opening and closing. Other wise its durable and look anywhere else for a similar bag and you will see $99 and up YOU will simply be paying for the brand.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for the great bag!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Gameplay very smooth excellent graphics its a keeper on my kindle. Fun and  affordable ,publisher puts out a lot of good games
B009IH0ICG|5.0|like anything Weber makes you can bet its worth the money.take two pieces of newspaper roll them up shape like a donut put them in the bottom.I don't try to light through the vent holes,I hold it up light from he bottom in couple of places set it down,in about 15 ready to go.It took acouple of tries being new to me.real happy with it!!!!
B00005NKK8|5.0|love all the songs.  I did not realize the movie had so many great songs in it.  Great for get togethers!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This game is the greatest. It's so great. I always like to make up characters. Then create what they look like. I just love it. One of the stars were taken away because if you buy the full version it's great. But if you can't afford it or can't get it, then it has a very limited options.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This is definitely a way to get into the game that doesn't require shoeboxes foll of cards and trying to find that rare to enhance your deck!  I could get into this, WARNING, be prepared to purchase the full version!
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Best show on television. If you like White Collar you will like this as well. Very addictive. Five star review.
B000HL09SA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Even better knowing it was based on true events!  I highly recommend Ny Dog Skip.  Enjoyable for kids and adults alike.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Loved this 3rd book in the wonderful trilogy by Stieg Larson. absolutely a page turner and would recommend these as a fantastic  and brilliant read.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|incredibly good read from an obviously superior author, although, as with most writers of this calibre, the prose can become somewhat daunting, it is nonetheless, delivered in a very bearable and instructive manner.  A wealth of interwoven tales and characters, some likeable, others ripe for hating, but all interestingly interlaced in a world of war magic and intrigue which keeps the imagination finely honed....classy stuff.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book is certainly full of twists and turns and is a good read, its very clever and different!  not really deserving of No 1 best seller .
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is so awesome my 5 year old hailey love's this game she likes 5 so much more than one 2 3 4

0060776579|4.0|The book helped me realize why I am not a Millionaire and probably never will be due to my core beliefs and lifes experiences.  I would rather give a gift then to sell someone something for a profit.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I couldn't put this book down, I felt almost every emotion possible while reading this book, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good read
B0098XY5VK|1.0|this game has been downloading at 0% for a day and a half its a discrace to all oyher games and amazkn just bogus
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved it! Exciting discoveries throughout the whole book. The ending was beautiful... not really a cliff Hanger for the third book but I'm buying it now anyway.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Even though this book is about teens I still at age 63 really enjoyed it. A good read, somewhat sad, but sometimes that is just the way life can be. So important to enjoy each moment of it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I loved this game!!! Plenty long enough, unlike others I have played. G5 always does a great job on their HO games!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was interesting from beginning to end. You could picture if something happened to your family how you would begin to unravel like they did.<br />A good read.
6305428387|1.0|I received this in the mail but the purchase description fails to mention that the dvd will not operate on American dvd players. I am very disappointed with my purchase and wish I would have read ALL the reviews before my buy.
B000FBJHEO|3.0|Confusing to the reader at times. Wish there were more details about some of the characters. Overall a good book to read
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun but too short.  I finished in just a couple of hours. Looking forward to new levels. I would recommend this app.
B0091REZMW|2.0|items are to small dark screen takes to long to get rewards love playing these kind of games not a fan of this one
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The bad seed, the father's love and blindness to his son's faults all combined to make this book unusual for a thriller.
030758836X|5.0|Dark Places by Gillian Flynn absolutely blew me away? Compared to that one, Sharp Objects was a disappointment, and I almost didn't pick up Gone Girl... I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />Nick and Amy Dunne are living in a rented house in a almost empty development.  Both have lost their jobs to the recession. They've burned through Amy's trust fund, money from the Amazing Amy books her parents based on her childhood.  And on the day of their fifth anniversary, Nick comes home to find the front door open and signs of a struggle in the living room.<br /> Amy is gone. And the husband is always the first suspect...<br /><br /> This is one of those books that I can't say too much about without spoiling the fun.  It's a psychological thriller that will keep you turning the pages to see what happens next. Is the story plausible? That's one of the complaints I keep seeing lately in reviews of the books I've loved. No, these things couldn't happen. But no one says they did. They're fiction, intended to be an entertaining read and not a depiction of real life.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|There were too many plots going on at once. I could not connect them all. It was not as good as the last two books,
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Awesome season! Great surprises as always! A+.  I can't wait for season 5 to come out for prime!  Keep'em coming!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey...Best series I have ever seen in my 70 years!  I cannot get this on my TV channels so I am buying<br />each season. Cant wait for season 4!
B007C94QRK|4.0|This is definitely for the fans of the Muppets. I myself having grown up with the Muppets enjoyed the movie, there are a lot of references to the original Muppets movie and the original Muppets show.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|I really enjoyed Game of Thrones. This is not my usual reading fare but was quickly gripped by the depth of character and particularly liked the structure. The reader is lulled into the progress of each individual lead character and then without warning the tension rises to an event which changes everything. These events are beautifully written and keep the reader on the edge of their seats. Personally I could have done with less fighting action and descriptions of blood and gore but I guess that is all part of the genre. At least there is a rattling good story to carry you through
0307450570|5.0|I have always like Martha Stewart. She makes things look so easy.<br />She has made my world so much easier.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this free version. This game was challenging but not too difficult.Additional levels should be fun. Looking forward to new releases.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Gets a little preachy at times, but a quick smooth read.. great starting point to talk to a loved one
1452115567|5.0|Maddie is such an agreeable, wonderful friend.  The pictures were just amazing and the fact that Maddie was so willing to pose is more amazing.  Absolutely loved this book.
1400064287|5.0|great advise and offers great starting points, i like the real qorld examples, good book to add to your tool kit
0670034711|5.0|Saw the movie, and heard the book was better so bought it for my friend who loved it!  Didn't care much for the movie.......
B005CA4SQK|5.0|The show is pure fun. If you are into the whole zombie craze this is the show for you . The wife and I enjoy the show and always cannot wait for the next episode. Good Buy
B00BFBSV72|5.0|Very good. A clone of doodle jump? No. Better. This game has a better art style and various other features.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|If you havent gotten on board yet you need too. This is one great show. Based on a comic book. The characters are great and the show has always had a good feel.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Ok at first I thought it would suck but it is AMAZING just stick with it I definitely give it five stars!!!!
0452273331|2.0|Unfortunately, I never finished this book.  I tried several times but just couldn't get hooked into it enough to continue.
0062255657|5.0|There are things when you are a kid that you cannot understand. Things beyond your control. Things you are powerless to prevent or to change. Sometimes these are singular, sudden things, and sometimes they are... life. The ongoing patterns of how things are. The problem is that growing up and coming to understand those things doesn't change the experience of  them. It doesn't change what you felt, then, when you were a child and small and powerless.<br /><br />The Ocean at The End of the Lane is a different kind of book from Neil Gaiman. He has called it his most personal work ever, and I think that shows in that it's written in first person, the first of his novels to be written that way. There are probably some of his short stories written in first person (the one about the cat in Smoke and Mirrors is poking at the back of my mind), but it's been long enough since I've read any of those to actually remember. It gives the story a very personal feel in a way that most first person projects do not. Also, and this could be because I have listened to him reading (I especially like February's) more than a few of his stories, I could just hear it in his actual voice in my head.<br /><br />There are many things about the way he presents the story that I really like. There are few descriptions. The things that are are just the things that are. The sister is just the sister. We know that she's younger. The mom and dad are the mom and the dad. His father's face gets red when he's angry. It's the kind of thing a child would notice while the other things, the rest of everything, just is. There is no teenage girl staring into a mirror admiring her hair and thinking about her chocolate-brown eyes, and, for that, I was especially thankful. The things that are described are the kinds of things a child would notice, that would stick in his head. The car stuck in the mud. The face of  the opal miner. His bent comic book. It really allows the reader to just travel along with the boy,experiencing as he experiences. Feeling the events that happen much more than seeing them.<br /><br />The novel centers around one of these events. A moment when a child finds out that he is, indeed, a small thing and powerless to withstand the force of an adult. This event is not the inciting incident nor is it the climax; it lies somewhere in-between, but it is the event upon which the story revolves. The thing that changed the life and perspective of the child. A moment where, after it has happened, you just want to go back to before it happened. But you can't go back.<br /><br />It's also about the negligence of adults. How they can dismiss as unimportant something that is the world for a child. Or how they can think things are replaceable when they're not. A cat is not just a cat, not any cat, and a dog is not just a dog. No more than a child is just a child. Or, even, a toy--or a washbasin, just his size--is just a toy. Things can't always be solved with, \\"I'll buy you a new one\\" or \\"I'll get you something better.\\"<br /><br />And, then, there's the whole question of memory and what's real. Something we, I suppose, can never be quite sure of.<br />\\"Is it true?\\"<br />\\"What you remembered? Probably. More or less.\\"<br /><br />This is a pretty great book. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I did The Graveyard Book or Neverwhere, but I think this one is going to linger much longer. Ask more questions. Give fewer answers. But that's okay. I like books that hang around in my head and make me think about them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I also have this one on my phone.  I love its easy access and language.  The choices of editions such as NKJV, NIV, and Good News Translations, have made this a must have app.
B004R1Q296|4.0|Not quite done with it yet. But it is interesting. I may be a little biased though I like history in general. This is well written though i find myself looking up some terms.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Writer has characters behave in a way no one would behave just to make his story work-a great mystery writer is hard to find - this guy isn't it...
B000NDMRCS|4.0|This was not you usual &#34;extinction&#34; or natural catastrophe film and actually, when my wife and I saw it in the theater, we did not care for it all that much.  In the theater, perhaps the most entertaining aspect of it was when all of the Americans were pouring over the Mexican border to escape the broadening disaster.  Frankly, the audience simply roared in laughter in unison!  However, we caught the film on TV a few months ago, and were able to do some comparisons with other disaster films and enjoyed it enough to finally make the purchase.<br /><br />The acting in the film was quite good, and the graphics and special effects were indeed excellent.  We have several &#34;disaster&#34; films in our collection, and we are selective about which ones we have selected, and we would definitely recommend this one.
B005OOL1IC|4.0|&#34;The Hangover II&#34; is a continuation of the mindless antics of the original. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to purchasing &#34;The Hangover III&#34;.
6304711883|5.0|This film is definitely better than the gripping original 1956 version of &#34;Ransom,&#34; starring Glenn Ford, and in several ways.  While the original was very dramatic and well made, the ending was quite disappointing, and never seeing the criminals who abducted and held for ransom his son actually detracted from the story line.  The possibilities were excellent, and these were exploited in the Mel Gibson version.  Whatever you think about Gibson's personal challenges, forget them as you watch this film because he is at his dramatic best here, as he takes an incredibly controversial stand in refusing the kidnappers' demands, at the possible expense of everything he holds dear in life.<br /><br />The casting for the film is truly excellent, and Gary Sinese is superlative in his role as the policeman-turned-villian.  Outstanding story line!  The ending of the film was very well done, and will satisfy the viewers who believe that in dealing with criminals who harm children, &#34;what goes around MUST come around!&#34;  This was lacking in Glenn Ford's original version of the story, where there was no visible accountability for the criminals' actions.  Of particular dramatic value is the believability of the inevitable conflict between Gibson and his wife, well-portrayed by Rene Russo, when Gibson announces on the media that he will not meet the kidnappers' demands, and that between Gibson and the public in general.<br /><br />While being very violent in places, this film has a welcome place among my favorite dramas, and is well worth owning.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Very satisfied;  my S4 did not come with a light app and I had gotten used to having a light handy.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Hollywood fails to understand that credibility is critical to the viewer; if we don't believe what we see we cannot enjoy the fare.  Hansel and Gretel both survive way too much physically and employ weaponry out of keeping with their times.  &#34;Van Helsing&#34; with Hugh Jackman suffered equally.  The last several &#34;Die Hards&#34; did not win audiences - same issues.  The story lines will carry the movie if the director and writers keep it real enough.  Action scenes are great and most of the reason for the movie in the first place but be creative, not impossible violent.  Hans comes across as a hard-headed idiot who would die in his first encounter against an experienced witch with magical powers.  Gretel doesn't impress either.  Neither have wards nor talents that should win against magical foes.  Why wait so long to have magically blessed bullets and weapons?  Tossing in a troll opened the door for lots more imagination but writers stopped there.  Oh well.  Beats re-runs of &#34;Golden Girls&#34; but I might choose &#34;Two and a Half Men&#34; unseen episode over this.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|I liked the  movie, but the back story was lacking. A good back story would have made it a lot better
B005EJNAK4|5.0|Every now and then Bruce Willis gets a chance to act and he makes the most of those opportunities.  A number of those chances have involved science fiction; &#34;Death Becomes Her&#34;, &#34;the  Sixth Sense&#34; and &#34;The Fifth Element&#34; are several of his best performances.  &#34;Surrogates&#34; is a superb detective story and a real look in the mirror to check out ourselves and our values; what is important and what is just surface sensationalism? In light of many of science's advances, which paths do we really want to take?  It is thought-provoking and sensitive - an intellectual dessert in a movie scape too often a thinking person's desert.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|For the regular version of this movie I give 4 stars but for the extended version I give 0 because first off it cuts out Mary's cameo then it gives us no new action sequences the only difference is a couple of different screen angles so if you buy this just get the theatrical version
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Really sweet movie from start to finish.  I enjoyed the moralistic ideal that true love conquers all and that choice is a God-given right in all matters.  We had a major clue to the idea of fatalism and a major writing flaw as well because Grandad wasn't all he started out to be - that should have mattered.  Although a supernatural movie, I found it easy to believe largely because the humans stayed human and did not survive or really experience anything that a normal human could not endure - unlike the unbelievable survivals of humans in &#34;Die Hard&#34; or &#34;Hansel and Gretel&#34; types of movies.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|First off let me tell you I am a huge schwarenegger fan so I love loved this it has chase scenes humor and awesome action scenes so if you are a fan of schwarenegger than I highly recommend this
B005KAH7QU|3.0|Lots of movies about enhanced warriors being black-listed and chased down.  Some work, like &#34;Bourne&#34; series but others just take the idea and re-work it until it is worked to death.  Hanna is wrong for LOT of reasons, not the least of which is that superbly trained operatives keep a superbly low profile - neither she nor dad were discrete at all.  For example, why was it necessary to send a signal to her arch-enemy to hunt her down?  Right from the start lots wrong.  Her escape from a top security facility - are we remembering some of &#34;Fifth Element&#34; and several biological disaster films here?  (I missed the lasers trying to zap her as she was maneuvering through the a/c ducts, etc.)  How or why did a top government agency have such psychopaths available to assist in tracking down the father/daughter?  Slightly better movie than &#34;Hansel and Gretel&#34; but it really doesn't work well when a 98 lb waif succeeds so well so often against so many who are so skilled and experienced.  Think of female gymnasts as much better examples of what believable, incredibly trained operatives would look like.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  However, after watching Schwartznegger in the original, an updated version was good but not quite the same.  I would recommend this movie just for the entertainment.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|One gets tired of young people rebelling against what they should do and messing things up on their own.  Here the credibility gap is immense because the caretaker seems clueless about training his young charge and preparing him for what he will have to compete against.  Example; how could the pet dog (etc) be a surprise?  As usual today, fight scenes have humans enduring and surviving way too much, diminishing the movie further.  Bad guys don't seem to be much of a threat to earth although they are supposed to be about to conquer it.  Huh?  Why are the 6 surviving supermen such a threat?  We seem to be missing a lot of the story to make this more credible.  The more I think about it, the less I like this movie.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|From a diehard Trek fan..... From the original series and movies, to Next Gen, Deep Space 9, the \\"Next Gen\\" movies, Voyager, and Enterprise. The reboot, in general, is brilliant. I loved the first movie and Into Darkness did not dissapoint. I was admittedly concerned about Abrahms directing as I am not a fan of his other movies, but he's done a great job with this! The reboot pays homage to the original characters while still putting a new twist to them. I love the new, more \\"human\\" Spock, the very humorous Scotty, the more edgy Uhura, and the ultra cocky new Kirk. The new Kahn is so much more freightening than he ever was in the series or the old movie. I just love the edgy feeling of the reboot. I can't wait for the BD release and look forward to many more movies!!!!!
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|Exceptional fantasy full of vibrant life and the best of humanity.  A young person's tale that takes one of any age back to a time when such idealism was possible - and reminds us that goodness is always an option.  Strike the blow against evil; always stand by the innocent, the right thing to do, etcetera, etcetera!!!  Costumes, writing, action, direction, choreography, wit - Robin Hood has it all.  It is in a league of classics few achieve; timeless movies we can watch again and again and still enjoy - like &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34;, the original &#34;King Kong&#34;, early Disney movies like &#34;Cinderella&#34;, the original &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34;...  Maybe I've seen &#34;Robin Hood&#34; two dozen times - I hope I live long enough to see it two dozen times more!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My kids and I really enjoyed this game. So far there is only 10 levels so we breezed through this game. This game makes you think.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I give it a 4.5; only save the 5 stars for ultra-good.  Life of Pi is a fascinating ride and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie.  I kept waiting for it to fall into stereotypical Hollywood and it never did.  Very surprising, sort of sad ending that has a charm of its own; life isn't always what we want it to be.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!  Better than &#34;Castaway&#34; I think!
1846148030|5.0|The Zen of Food. Delicious and stimulating from head to stomach.  Sending it to every cook and eater I know.  jack
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I love Babs, and love this film.  did you know she used all of her own clothes for it? Fabulous.
B00005JPSM|3.0|This movie is very cute and heartwarming. the storyline is fun the only downside of this movie is that it happens to be very cookie cutter and within five minuets you already know how this movie is going to end. Glad I got it for the price I did not sure it would be worth to much more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love the app but its really addicting! There's a good variety of charecters and its hard to choose which one to save for first but its an awesome app!!!!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|While a novel, this book appears to be telling it like it really was in Papua New Guinea back in the 70s/the era of independence. A neighbour's son was doing his doctorate at the university there and the book fit with what I heard over the garden fence.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Escape was great. Lots of fun and challenging  whole family enjoyed it  Can't wait for more rooms and to keep going
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I don't like hyped up movies but I waited long enough to check this one out and it was great. If I had chosen to watch it at release I probably would not have enjoyed it as much.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I was familiar with three of the songs (top of the world, it's time, and radioactive) and was impressed that the rest of the album was equally enjoyable.
B009DH372Y|5.0|Great video. Remastered edition is very high quality for being twenty five years old.  A good addition for those who like Queen.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|Beautiful game controls are okay. It's just honestly not a good shooter or bullet hell game in general. No matter how you adjust the screen size in game it doesn't honestly effect the game play in general. Its difficult to judge where bullets are or how to judge them if your finger is always in the way. A note to the dev and their friends posting in the review section. No game instructions included within the game  or having to go to a website to find them is laziness on your part. Retro shooter or not in game instructions built into the app should be common sense. It has nothing to do with the game being moved to another platform.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|This is one of Queen's best performances.  The set also includes their Live Aid performance which is still regarded  the best rock performance of all time.  Excellent remaster edition.
B00DGNO3WE|1.0|Movie was blinking flashing impossible to view. I am having some problems with the quality of the streaming products. Amazon needs to continue its improvements on this matter or will loose me as a client.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I started couldn't put it down until the last page was read!!<br />Can't wait to start Catching Fire!! Go Katniss!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! So much fun!!! Fun yet challenging and a little addictive! Can't wait for rooms to be available so I can keep going!
B003YVCJQ0|5.0|Great story, action and acting. The whole world works together to stop the alien invasion from wiping us out. Epic!
B003B02O0A|5.0|Do not know how I missed reading this book before. Powerfully written with insight into the Times and lives in the south. The heart and soul of Jake was so real I could feel the turmoil with every page. It was hard to put th book down. Wish we would hear more in the future about Ellen and where her life and career take her. Would highly recommend this book. As you read remember the Times and the use of the vernacular as being part of life and culture in a world most of us know little about. Looking forward to Sycamore coming out this fall.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is an awesome game. It's long, has special challenges for each level, can upgrade weapons.  They especially have in-game gems that you can spend to buy items.  You earn the gems on each level instead of having to buy them like you would on any typical game trying to steal extra money from you, like a certain other game with candy... That's a real plus for me :)
1416549447|5.0|I ran 4 miles 3 times last week. A month ago I could not run a 5k without stopping to walk. I had no pain during the runs and no recovery pain at all. Now I am increasing my pace. Yesterday I did 1.5 miler in PR time :) I am recommending this program to anyone who will listen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome game.  I love it, until I reached level 9.  The game freezes on the clay pots by the elevator.  Some scenes that I am able to click on, I can only go so far the it goes back to the clay pots and freezes again.  Please fix this issue.  I really loved playing this game and would like to continue.
0307279189|2.0|A great story, but it is comes across as being a story that the author is trying to make more dramatic than it actually was. Certainly great human achievement but I dont like or trust the Mr. McDougall's embellishments.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|This movie was funny and hilarious at times.<br />The kids loved it and it is also a great movie for adults i highly recommend this to any one.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|although I liked his first two books better, this one was still excellent.  great story, though loses a bit of steam at the end.  the beginning is great.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|IF your looking for a fun loving movie to keep the kids entertained this is the one to watch.<br />Thanks to amazon for offering the 24 hour rental your going to need it with the kids wanting to watch it over and over.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|The scenery, history and characters in the show are amazing.  It's good to find out about the viking culture that is more historical that fable. Can't wait for season 2!
B000P0J024|5.0|We've had Vol 1 for years and played in many many times .. big fans.  Decide to find Vol 3 and ran across the set that included the DVD.  So glad we did.  The 20+ minute video is awesome.  I think knowing Vol 1 so well made the video an extra treat.  To watch and hear how it all came together was great.<br /><br />Vol 1 to us is the greatest simply because of Roy Orbison.  We never really considered buying Vol 3 since he wasn't part of it.  However it is very good as well.  Once we listened through it a few times it really does grow on you.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to stumble across a mint copy of Vol 1 on vinyl at a small record shop while on a trip.  To us there is an extra warmth and quality listening to the vinyl copy.  Now to find Vol 3!  Highly recommend the Traveling Wilbury's and might as well have the video too.  Personally I would hold off on watching the video until you are really familiar with Vol 1.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Better be careful! This one sure can be addictive!  Just learned how to play and it is so much fun!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The story continues,but there is not much new with Gideon  I ill continue to trajectory to find out how they end.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I am a Jane Austen fan.  I have all of her novels in books, on DVDs, and audio.  I have several versions of Persuasion.<br />This is my favorite!!
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|Loved this movie, lots of special effects to bring new perspective to an old fairy tale, love it when an old fairy tale gets redone over and over from different viewpoints, they should make more of these for the whole family to enjoy, i think they should take it further and make a series of it.
0345529057|4.0|Now I need book 5.  It is my hope that resolutions for some of the characters might be in book 5 since it was written<br />10 years ago.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved it, watched it with the kids, they loved it as well, loved the action in it, we like these kind of movies we can watch with anyone!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked playing this game, it is challenging and fun. I highly recommend this game. Is free which is also cool.
B0030B624E|5.0|The kids really loved it and love Woody Harrelson and his twinkies! they all want to see it again and hope for another sequel to this one!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The various stories were connected,but as a fan of mystery, I think it lacked the wow factor at the end. The various stories were interesting and at times surprising but I needed a more captivating ending. I'll stick to mysteries.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app was fun. Makes you think outside the box to figure out how to get out. I had fun and can't wait for more levels.
B00CATSONE|5.0|INTERESTING BOOK, GOOD FLOW, APPRECIATIVE OF SUBJECT MATTER<br /><br />(I DON'T CARE FOR THE FACT THAT THERE IS A WORD LIMIT ON COMMENTS)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever<br />But it needs to update faster and we need to be able to make and wear our own skin<br />But it's an awesome game!!
B000255LNE|5.0|FAST SHIPMENT, VERY HAPPY WITH SELLER, JUST WHAT I WANTED, 5 STARS<br />What aspects of this work do you like or dislike?<br />How has this work impacted you?<br />What should other customers know when considering this item?<br />What other works would you compare this to?
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book .I think that all people young or old should read this. It's filled with just enough action and a touch of romance. Five stars all the way!!!!! It's realistic in the form of hatred and defiance. And shows how society can have no mercy.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|The directions were not clear as to how to use this.  Also some of the sounds were not true to my listening.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie was so well done. You really came to like all of the good guys and wanted the bad guys to get what they deserved. I wasn't to graphic in any way and not to sappy either. The acting was so believable and it was thoroughly enjoyable!
B0063IH60K|3.0|This was OK to play but I was looking for more solitaire like phaze 6 and also some puzzle type.  Most of the games are for theYOUNG!  i'M NOT THAT!
B00BBW16HW|4.0|I started this flick thinking it might be just another sugar-coated feel-good film. I was delightfully surprised to find a very genuine and heartfelt story, acted with great authenticity. Its well paced, given that it could easily slide into boredom. François Cluzet finds the glittering edge of humanity, and what its like to be trapped inside a failing body.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I enjoyed it so much.  I like to read books from the past.<br />I'm glad you offered the children's version, ordered 3 copies for my children.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|This case is perfect. It's durable and importantly protects your iPhone very well. I liked the mixed materials (hard colored piece, softer black base) and unlike many hard plastics, this case doesn't seem to get greasy from my hands. Highly recommend.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Its a kool app is is great App cause its free the only part i dont like boutit is u have to have wifi on at all times
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Not big on the redundancy of the content - NFL football....the Eagles mania....obsessive physical working out.  And I even am a pro football fan, live in PA, and work with a personal trainer.  Just thought the plot dragged through all of that.  The resolution and the weaving of all the loose ends at the finish sort of saves it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Pretty cool game. Needs more levels. Challenging. Fun. I want more games like this. WOOOOO! That was fun. I suggest this to anyone looking for a puzzle game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accuweather is accurate and up to the minute. Nice app . Easy to read information.  Able to check multiple locations easily and fast. A great tool thats readily accessed on my kindle fire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool.U can win prizes and run from the a police man and his dog, and how many coins u get,u can use those coins to buy things at the store on the game.The best running game ever.If I could describe this game in one word it would be AWESOME.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This three book series was great. I love how Anastasia Steele is intimidated by Christian Grey at the start and by the end of the book has him wrapped around her finger. This book will kick your senses into overdrive and pull you in. Sex & Emotion at the turn of a page. Happy Reading...
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This one was a little slow for the first half but picked up steam at the end. Getting the picture that this is written as a series instead of separate books.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This three book series was great. I love how Anastasia Steele is intimidated by Christian Grey at the start and by the end of the book has him wrapped around her finger. This book will kick your senses into overdrive and pull you in. Sex & Emotion at the turn of a page. Happy Reading...
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book kept my attention, and I believe makes you remember that you shouldn't forget what is important, and appreciate the intangibles that you have.  Finished it very quickly as the book kept your interest, and you wanted to keep reading to see where his pilgrimage would lead.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the traditions and manner of dressing.  I really appreciate how they are always polite even when they are displeased with someone.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|their are some gross parts in this movie. Don't recommend for kids under 14. , , But over all loved it
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|it's just a great movie. watched it again recently and it really holds up, but you already new that didn't you...
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Im confused still. not sure if the ending is true or his other version of the story was true? hmm
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|It got my Kindle up and running and I appreciate it.  Got to finish my mystery!  Thanks for the phone help.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Really pretty good fairly coheasive and certain amount of subtrifuge. Want to watch others to see if it improves.Can't wait.
0812974611|5.0|A very intriguing and informative historical novel.  This is an action packed history lesson full of plot twists, romance and adventure.<br /><br />A very enjoyable read!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Dungeon Hunter is awesome. I didn't know that dungeon Hunter even existed before I found it. And I am glad that I found it because it is really fun. I think I am going to share with my friends.
B00005UOXN|5.0|I wore out my original album and bought this to replace it. Great! Lots of energy!  Best of Billy Idol!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book gives a very good look at what it was like during the time that slaves were owned in America - especially the abuses women had to endure as a result of being &#34;owned.&#34;  I could not help but draw parallels to today to people who do not or can not take charge of their own lives.  It was well written and gives one pause for thought.  .
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is a very enlightening book on how ideas, imagination and insight propels the minds to new inventions. I like that it also tell the story of how personalities and relationship (who you know) can determent an outcome of an idea to invention. I like that it also validates those of us who are not in the limelight. That our contributions does cause a ripple of greatness within the the community.
B00BESCJII|5.0|The title does not give this film the justice it deserves for the depth it brings..great acting, story and message.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|First ever album I bought from an AI winner. Great music to listen to doing whatever. The future looks bright for Phillip :)
B008KEQMDC|4.0|Nice movie, with some funny moments and overall a heartwarming spirit.  If this is what to really expect when having a child, we are in trouble!
B005KDWUFA|5.0|I like this and have my own copy but want to share this quality of artistry to someone else.  A-one.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Terrific book I learned quite alot from reading. The<br />time flew by as it held my interest from start to finish.<br />I will be looking for more from this author.<br />Burt
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great app game works great I use it in my iPhone and Kindle.  I have tried others but this is the best.
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|This review is slightly biased - I enjoy the Sookie Stackhouse novels and am gutted they have come to an end.<br />I enjoyed this book and found, that as a last book, it more or less wraps everything up... But I always want more...<br />It's a great read!
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Enjoyed the read but the ending was disappointing.  Pointed contemporary criticism of corporate interference with essential government functions, wrapped around a good story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very fun game that has very fun missions and is very addicting. Get the game if you have a brain.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|I was hesitant in buying this baseline model of APU for my living room HTPC but GLAD i did.  I have it set to high performance and can handle everything i've thrown at it.  BR movies, DVD movies, and streaming WMC and using my XBOX 360 as an extender.  it can handle it all.  best of all it runs cool, i removed the other fan in my HTPC case and just run this fan with the CPU only and get 29-31c idle temp and 44c under load.  I am very happy i did not buy the more expensive models of aPU and stuck with the entry level model which meets all my needs.  Just dont try to transcode video it was not designed for it and takes forever, i have a FX-6300 for that
B001CB8NQE|5.0|This season brings Stargate Atlantis all together and ties into the Legacy Books to bring the show full circle. A must have for any Atlantis Fan,
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is great for helping girls see that beauty is not easy. My 5 year old loves making her princess ready for the ball.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is good so far. might need a little more explanations on a few of the rooms.i found the last couple of rooms quite good.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|O my i cant even say how good this movie is!!!! Best movie ever!!! I cant wait for the second movie to come out!!!
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I loved the books, and really wanted to like this movie.  I thought the actors were great.  However, while I understand a movie will NEVER match the level of detail a book has, this movie made major changes to characters and story lines that were too hard to accept.  I felt like they were being cheap by making Amma into some younger voodoo woman rather than the loyal and loving older character with so much wisdom and spell knowledge that she was supposed to be.  And then on top of that also made her the librarian.  It didn't fit.  I also felt like the special effects were for the most part incredibly cheesy.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is beyond my expectations, and the art of the cards is just beatiful! Congratulations to the creators for this very good game.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I have had the opportunity to visit Rajasthan many years ago, and find I really enjoy seeing films with such a real depiction of the quirks, kindness, and beauty of the people and country.  This one is absolutely great!  I would show it to everyone contemplating traveling to India.
B009XWD02G|1.0|Does not allow you to download or play music. Deleted it quickly, nothing but ads.  Don't waste your time, totally worthless.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I didn't think I would like this series but my daughters told me how good it is so I thought I would give it a try. I am totally addicted to it now! I LOVE it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Casting is spot on. Story is captivating and scenery is wonderful. Only thing I didn't like was the ending of the last episode.
B005LAIIMG|1.0|The moment I saw the trailer, I could tell this movie would be bad. Paramount, as much as I love them for Star Trek, this was a fail. They probably told the director and scriptwriter, \\"make a movie that will sell.\\" I'm serious. This movie is way lower than Lord of the Rings, or even 300. I give it a F. I mean, they showed human beings dying like cockroaches. Like bugs. That is not how humanity is represented and it's disgusting. Way worse than 2012.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I have been watching the series and occasionally miss some of the dialogue because of some of the heavier accents.  The book is very well written. Many of the details of the relationships between the families and individuals are well elucidated.  I like the way that the story is told from the viewpoints of the characters. It's hard to put down!!
0439023521|4.0|Good story.  Middle school and high school kids will enjoy it.<br />Good character development.  Couldn't put it down. .A real page turner.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show is fantastic. There is always something new happening and try as you might, the twists are impossible to predict. The characters are wonderfully developed and very well-played by the actors. The plot is very well-written and really keeps you on your toes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am still reading this one but I am eager to finally see what happens at the end.  I can not wait for the movie to come out.  I hope they keep the same actors throughout.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you like reading romance novels then you will love this series it definitely takes it up a notch! It was a bit predictable at times but overall a good read and I would recommend it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book series keeps my interest.  I always want to know what is going to happen next.  I did not like this one as much as I liked the first one.  Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B008Y7DWC4|3.0|Good to watch the one time as the movie lacks the strong story line and screenplay. Expected more in this movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie and decided to download the book.  The movie stayed true to the book.  Very entertaining and creative book!
B0083DJUMA|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, great content and interesting stories. I look forward to additional books from the author and about the subject.
147674355X|5.0|I had seen a lot about Hopeless on facebook and a friend of mine is lucky enough to have a signed paperback that she loaned me. All I can say is, wow. I could not put the book down and pretty much finished it in one sitting.<br /><br />Hoover's characters are very real and the situations they find themselves in are heartbreakingly depicted. I am in awe of Hoover's prose and the way she reveals so much without breaking character.<br /><br />I am going to have a hard time giving the book back because the paperbacks are not actually available in Australia, and I will definitely be reading 'Losing Hope'.
B00BIR381W|4.0|Just a cute show with four Nancy Drews with different personalities and no worthless sex scenes.  There was also parental involvement.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was literally a page turner. From the beginning I was hooked. So many plot twists and turns, and a main character you can't help but like. Baldacci has given you a great read here, so why waste more time on this review. Absolutely the best fiction read of 2013 for me.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Helps to Keep me occupied when I am  bored , my grand kids enjoy it also.Check it out! different ways to play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This Game Is Pretty Cool And Keeps My kids Busy Be For Dinner Time And It Could Also keep Me Busy *Wink*
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What a brain teaser! I loved the graphics as well as the multiple layers. There was no repetition. Everything felt new!
B00003CXIP|5.0|great movie...  perfect for ages 12 and up.  great messages about life and what can/can-not happen to children that actually go outside and play.
B004V9MU86|5.0|In this book Zusak has demonstrated the most remarkable use of simile and metaphor that I've ever read in the English language. Please don't be put off by the Introduction where he explains that the narrator is The Grim Reaper, as I almost was. I adored Rose body like a wardrobe and her husband Hans' eyes which were so steely metallic that they clanked when he blinked!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|A t first, I thought this film would  never be as good as  christpher Nolan's Batman trilogy. But I loved every minute of the film. Now I can see why it won four Oscars and was nominated for best picture. But it is a bery complicated movie. It requires lots of attention. A movie that deserves its five stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Grand kids love this game and could  play all day if permitted. Great group game and encourages their imagination, great.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Love to watch it. Can't miss it. I like to watch the series over and over.  Hope it is on for a long time.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this as a teacher looking for a good read aloud for my 3rd and 4th graders.  I laughed and cried.  The author was in tune with kids.  I recommend this book, but 3rd grade is a little young.  Wonderful message of; empathy, kindness, standing together and what it feels like to be an outsider.
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|I love it very much its challenging but fun I cant get through a level but I'm trying so overall its fun and challenging
B002BU0DPE|5.0|My Grandson Loved His Birthday Gift...It Is Such A Good Product The Service Was Fast & Friendly & Very Competitive $$$ ...Will Recommend This Seller To Others Looking For Same Type Of Item...
B00846REIS|2.0|I've read Fifty Shades and this story line is very similar.  Business man taking advantage of a young female in his building and all the jealously and controlling with it.
B001DTTG16|3.0|This movie is definitely a product of its time with the fashion and hairstyles. The dancing and music however is timeless. Can't say much for the dialogue, very sophomoric and lame.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|I enjoyed the movie a lot.  I thought the acting was great....However, as with all British actors, I found some of the dialogue difficult to understand.  I thought the lead male actor magnificent....even if I didn't always understand what he said....His face was the face of pure evil.  The female lead was very good and I was not prepared for the ending.....Watch it.  You'll like it!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved it! Can't wait for more levels!! Warning - Could be addicting. Makes you use your brain to problem solve your way out of each room.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Ok, so anyone who's watched even a little Star Trek knows the story about &#34;Red Shirt&#34; crew who<br />beam down with Kirk, Spock, etc. ... dead meat. This book takes you on a delightful romp in an<br />improbable universe and explores this problem from the point of view of the red shirts ... but the<br />best part for me was the  three codas ... these additions to the already enjoyable story show the<br />skill John Scalzi has as a storyteller at the top of his game. Enjoy!
B00422LESO|3.0|This story is a great summery, beach read. The writing isn't stellar, and the story is a bit cliche and unbelievable, but if you're a Jane Austen fan, you will definitely get more than a few chuckles while reading this novel. WIthout giving much away, you follow a very Elizabeth Bennet like character through the story as she finds herself in strange situations. The ending is a interestingly unrealistic, but it's cute, and overall, I enjoyed it.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I do not think this will be a movie I will watch over and over.  I expected more from this movie.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is a memoir of sorts with Tina Fey's signature humor throughout. I found myself really enjoying how normal she seems despite her wildly huge successes--from SNL to 30 Rock and feeling as though all her struggles really catapulted her into awesomeness. I was expecting to laugh the whole time (which I pretty much did), but was pleasantly surprised to read a lot of heart too. I highly recommend.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie very much.  It is the perfect movie to watch as a couple on a rainy day.
0920668364|5.0|When I was a little girl, my mother read this book to me so many times that I knew all the words by heart. It is sweet and light hearted, but it sends a truly powerful message, that of unconditional, everlasting love that a parent has for a child--and that a child shares for his mother. Yes, there are mature concepts such as death that are implied, but that is not the focus of the book. The story teaches love and demonstrates how love never ends, it goes on forever.<br /><br />It will forever leave you wanting to tell your own children and loved ones:<br />I love you forever,<br />I like you for always,<br />As long as I'm living,<br />My baby you'll be.
0062238868|5.0|The book is honest and raw.  Great stories about combat and training giving you a real sense of being in the battle and what these guys and their families truly sacrifice for America.  This is a great read and a great book from a great man and warrior.  Thanks Chris, thanks Taya.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Not your typical James Bond movie...no crazy &#34;toys' to use against the bad guys or to save your a** when there is no chance for survival.  But stiil, one of the best Bond movies to date.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is really fun because you never know what is going to happen and it is a big challenge good job.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|As a resident of the Midwest I feel drawn to all things OZ. If you have always wondered how the Wizard got started...this is the movie fore YOU!

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the best puzzle game I've tackled...curiouser and curiouser! I thoroughly enjoyed it because of its layer upon layer of wonderful and diverse clues and solutions. My only complaint is how quickly it ended. Do it again FIREPROOF =))
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show! Excellent acting and a vibrant story line that helps draw the viewer in from the very first episode.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|A Matrix style series where the content lives you thinking. Outstanding performance. A must see series, once you start you cannot drop.
0345529057|5.0|I won't comment here on the books themselves (but they ARE awesome), however this set is a great value. Great for anyone looking to get started with the GoT series.
B00A44HRG2|3.0|On most of the locations, the cameras were blacked out and I know it wasn't night because it says the time in the corner of the screen. And the camera in Germany, it said about 1:00pm so I know it should be brighter than that. But I did think it was really cool that you could see into another country, state, or you hometown.<br />BUT STILL, I'M NOW IMPRESSED THAT MUCH !
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|Had to buy another copy for my gym at work since they don't have a Blu-ray player.  Couldn't be happier!

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|It took a little getting used to, but I love it.  I have been using it to play League of Legends and the assignable buttons are awesome.  It is also pretty comfortable in my hand.
0920668364|5.0|I love this book and wanted my granddaughter to have in her library of books.  Thanks for the very fast and efficient service in receiving the book.  You rock!
B000002JNJ|5.0|If there is a pantera album to start with this would be the one. From top to bottom every song is awesome.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Feels almost like playing live. Especially good for people new to the game. I would recommend to anyone, new or experienced.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Great way to learn the game without spending a fortune. Easy tutorials get you used to cards and play. Great art work in the cards,too.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I loved each episode and felt as if I had turned the clock bsck to the long ago days of my youth.
B000007UQT|5.0|It's not \\"Band On The Run\\",  but contains enough gems to make it more than worth the price of admission. Features vocal and guitar tradeoffs on \\"Used To Be Bad&#34 with Steve Miller;. Don't miss \\"The World Tonight\\" with fun Macca turns-of-phrases like \\"I go back so far, I'm in front of me\\". Other standout tracks include the acoustic foot-tapper, \\"Great Day\\" (with wife Linda on backing vocals), \\"Beautiful Night\\" (with Ringo on drums & backing vocals), \\"Young Boy\\" and \\"Souvenir\\".  For those who don't know the story, when asked by a reporter how the group came up with the name \\"The Beatles\\", John Lennon allegedly answered, \\"In a dream, a man came to me on a flaming pie and said unto us, 'You are Beatles... with an A'.\\"
B008G3N71W|5.0|This review is from the husband of an avid reader of erotica. I don't write many reviews but read a lot of wicked, sexy stories on my wife's Kindle, when I can pry it from her. I enjoy reading about all the pleasures that the flesh can offer. 'A Girl's Adventure' is direct, Greta kept my attention with her scorching, hot adventure. A total turn-on. Now, I'll read the others my wife has downloaded.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am sometimes hesitant to read unknown authors because I don't like to read about (or see) violence - there's too much of that in the real world without adding to it in fiction.  But this book did have any violence or sex that made me stop reading, and I very much liked the ending.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|Epic was a good movie it's just the app sucks because they only let you play for a little bit and then when your free trial time is up you.have to money and I am not paying any Money FOR A FREE. APP
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Glad this is finally portable, works and the controls are perfect glad I purchased it will continue until I unlock everything
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A very good end to the suspense filled hunger games series. It always had me thinking of what was going to happen next.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game and recommend it to everyone. Makes you think and use your brain. Cant wait for the update to come out with more levels.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Having a very intense interest in aviation related material, I thought that this was going to be just that. That was until after I had read some of the other reviews. So, banking on that there are not too many bad movies that have Denzel Washington, I decided to buy this.<br />Starting with an open mind from the very beginning, not knowing what to expect, I got to see a truly amazing story unfold with parallels of my own life experiences, which made this even more reallistic.<br />As far as the technical details and nuance of an actual airline pilot, I found to be inconsequential to the true story line.<br />I would recommend this movie.
B000W4KT64|1.0|It was not factory sealed, as promised, and did not work. Incredibly disappointing on my daughter's 10th birthday as this was the only gift she wanted.
B004PGNB1K|4.0|So the book's great.  More twists and turns than a labyrinth, but doesn't lose focus of the key characters.<br />And it took him four years between the first one and this one!<br />It'll take the whole next volume just to get us through the history to the current point in time; and then volumes more after that to save the world.<br />Rothfuss needs to start writing faster, or we'll all be in retirement before he finishes the series.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a great game. My son and I have enjoyed building the park together. It gets tedious at times with waiting to accumulate the needed coins to purchase things and then having to wait for areas to be cleared or eggs to hatch, but it's still fun and exciting when you accomplish your goals.
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|Do you have trouble falling asleep? Perhaps you have a hard time sleeping when you travel, being in a strange place wreaking havoc w/ your normal sleep patterns? Or maybe you have not trouble falling asleep when you 1st go to bed, but then wake up in the middle of the night & can't get back to sleep? Those are examples of why you might want this app.<br /><br />I've been using SoundSleep for some time now, and when Lightning Bug came up on FAOTD, I had to give it a look. Not that I'd been unhappy w/ SoundSleep (hereafter &#34;SS), but just to see if Lightning Bug was any different.<br /><br />1908Media (the company selling this app) has taken an interesting modular approach to it, so it is potentially more customizable than SS. The individual audio modules however, do not have the fine tuning available in SoundSleep's fixed list of noise generators: they're either off or on. So far, I haven't found this to be much of a drawback, but I haven't really used LB much yet, so it's hard for me to state unequivocally which I prefer.<br /><br />One BIG feature in LB's favor is its plethora of alarm tones and the ability to adjust the alarm volume vs. the background audio. After all, the point of this app is to help you get to sleep & STAY asleep, so it makes sense that it needs a functional alarm to help you wake up again [something the programmers of SS apparently overlooked... ;-) ] One oddity about the alarm function is that the alarm sample tracks play at the same volume as the audio loop tracks, but never fear: after you've selected the alarm, you can then adjust its volume separately from the rest of the program [which is why this function excels over that in SS.]<br /><br />The program comes with a basic set of 4 audio loops, & a few b/g scenes. From within the program you can download more sets of scenes w/ accompanying audio modules [these were all free at the time I got them; perhaps that may change in the future once demand for the app develops?] Anyway, it's utterly ridiculous that there is such a huge selection of background scenes [&#34;desktops&#34; or whatever you want to call them], since the entire purpose of this app is to GET YOU TO CLOSE YOUR EYES & GO TO SLEEP! Which obviously means you won't be wasting any valuable zzz time admiring the spiffy desktop scene you selected. Oh well, it's nice that the developer added that functionality while they were building in the matching modularity for the loop tracks, but talk about a waste of man hours! Whatever, I can't fault the app for having the feature, I just ponder over the pointlessness of it all... :-D<br /><br />As I said, I haven't had this very long to explore it in detail, but I have over a year's experience with its competition, SoundSleep, and I suspect I may end up liking this better due to the superior alarm functionality. At any rate, even tho' I got this as Amazon's FAOTD selection [&#34;Thanks 'zon!], I can guarantee you IT IS WORTH SPENDING MONEY ON if you have difficulty falling/staying asleep at night. I never would have considered liking this sort of product much until after I saw that episode on Sex In The City years ago where one of the characters dated a guy w/ a white noise generator. These are much better, since the audio loops are based upon natural sounds [like wind, rain, waves, etc] that are cued to rhythms that foster the brain wave frequencies found during sleep [at least that's the case for SoundSleep; I presume Lightning Bug is as well, altho' I haven't read too much on it, since it would be silly for them to try to compete in this area w/o exploiting the known research the same as their competitor(s)...]  Anyway, the same ex- who made me watch SitC is also the one who used to plead w/ me to help her get to sleep & eventually infected me w/ her insomnia, so now I'm very happy apps like LB exist! Get it, use it, & get a good night's sleep! :-)
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie and good build up to an epic finale. Love the way they used the Hulk and Captain America in this. Of course Tony Start steals the show! I am a DC first fan but don't think Justice League could top this.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|Loved this app till I installed it on my new Galaxy  S4. Now it will not save any pdfs.  Hope this us fixed soon.<br />****INTSIG responded to my complaint and provided a link to a copy that works on my S4.  I have changed my rating to reflect the app and the service.<br />Thanks INTSIG
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this screwdriver last week and it was delivered yesterday. Non-stop fun so far!! I love how much it looks like the one David Tennant uses, and I can't stop going around the house pointing it at stuff and pushing the buttons. The sound effects are awesome and the secret ink pen with the UV light really works! I can even pretend I have psychic paper. I do agree with some of the other reviews in that the bottons can be pushed a little too easily, but that's just if it's in a crowded purse or something. Lastly, it may seem a little pricey but I think it was worth it. Though it's just a plastic prop, it's still tons of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey fun. Allons-y!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great app, challenging but not crazy difficult.  Looking forward to when the developer adds new levels (currently only ten levels).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Incredible characters and plot.  Immaculate acting.  Historical accuracy.  What more could you ask for in drama series?  I love it.
B00A8ZZ3WM|5.0|Absolutely love this album. Charlie is amazing and Ben is Ben, great song writing and playing. Highly recommend. Enough said!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I love this album I listen to it everyday I'm a big fan of maroon 5 so kudos to them for making a very good album

B005LJITS0|5.0|Pretty true to the comic series. I liked it better than the Avengers. Of course that is probably due to my love of the comic as a kid.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|Ever wonder where &#34;lol&#34; originated?  One of the true, rare moments that I have laughed out loud, this book will send you into a laughing fit.

B002L4QP0M|4.0|An attention keeper.  I had trouble giving this book a rest. I wanted to know the next turn this tale was going to take. Enjoyable story with interesting characters.
B000002KAT|5.0|a holy man something the sky-god made right there with Seamus Heaney's From the Republic of Conscience also look at BBC youtube of &#34;Behind the Ritual&#34; if you are old it will help
B0029OR9JU|1.0|The sound is awful.  One cannot hear the words. Music is tinny.  This is not worth ordering on cloud player.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I found myself hooked almost immediately & couldn't put it down. Great introduction for the rest of the series. I highly recommend!
1455113549|5.0|Audio book of defending jacob: Excellent service, good book, thank you. I donated it to my local library. They will ejoy it.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Good way to show how Oz was a con artist and how he arrived in Oz . Liked the introduction to the witches worth watching. I like the journey to him becoming The Great And Powerful Oz.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|I have been a fan since the Warning. I have enjoyed every release up until Dedicated to Chaos; though I will admit I felt like the more recent releases were declining in quality (OMCII and American Soldier) and were filled with many average songs. With the release of Queensryche/Queensryche, there has been a return to form. It is an entire album of hard rock QR style from beginning to end. QR has shed the Geoff Tate sound that has been obvious for years and has returned to their original drive/sound. In fact, this album seems eerily reminiscent of the Warning and for someone that has been a loyal fan for many years, I am glad to finally hear an album that reflects an entire band effort.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|It is a good game where you can be as creative as you want, but i suggest if they can let you type in<br />characters from books and movies.<br />And they should let you have all the characters since you paid it.<br />So it's a nice game but it should add some updates.<br />I reccomend if you are creative and are good with adjectives.<br />Sincerely, Daughter of Poseidon. &lt;3
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really like this show.  I like the cast and the history intertwined in the story.  The writing is good and I like the fast pace of the show.  Maggie Smith's zingers make this show.  I was not thrilled about the season 3 ending but I will still watch season 4 regardless.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Butt how come it takes WiFi to do multiplayer?<br />I wish this version had some of the mods like resident evil
B00CHILW64|5.0|This was a well done movie. The story was told very well. Touching and moving...and yes, my husband and I both cried.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|A little confusing but at the same time I totally understand this beautiful book.<br />This book is as amazing and me as a future author never would have thought of this.
B00C3N9O9K|5.0|Keeps getting better every time he comes out with new music but if you can see him leve don't miss it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Lost sleep over this book. Would not stop until I was done. Realistic. Any parent can relate. It absorbs you.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|this app is stupid i downloaded it and it keeps freezing so i would recommend not getting this app but im not u and ur not me
B006VFLIYK|5.0|A real page turner.  This book has it all. Can't wait to meet Robie .  Baldacci is a master at suspense.
B0083I90HU|5.0|This is a novel, but it was well researched and told the story well of European Jews during WW ll.  I had seen the film, but this was even better!  My husband is now reading the book.  It kept my attention and I wanted to read it straight through to the end.  It's a mystery of sorts.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I was very disappointed by the variety of games for the vita.  I hesitated to buy this game since most of the vita games that I have bought were pretty boring and mediocre at best.  This game however, blew my mind and reminded me of why I love playing games in the first place.  It is very in depth and entertaining.  Probably the best game for the Vita system so far!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A true mystery/thriller that I couldn't put down. What an ending!!!  Stunned doesn't even begin to describe how I felt!
0451450523|5.0|I got this book as part of the Humble Bundle ebook 2 edition although it has been on my list in paperback form for sometime.  The edition was great and worked flawlessly on my kindle.  This is an amazing story that I don't think gets the credit it really deserves.  There is a light-heartedness to it which makes it fun to read but doesn't take away from the serious message of the overall story.  I know Peter S Beagle wrote this without a plan and you definitely get that feel from the book but in a good way.  Unlike most books where I can pick out the obvious twists and turns from the very beginning this book felt like an actual adventure I was a part of.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Though short, and sometimes tragic, Downton continues to be a great series. Streaming quality was great on the Roku 2 XS.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|The book is perfect, very interesting. Good story. The real life is very hard for her. Good lecture for parents.
B000000WHX|5.0|rough, unrefined, very nineties massive attack feel.  has all the elements of their sound, but in vestigial form.  this album is great, and the band truly gets better as they grow, with each album that they come out with.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun and great time killer perfect when you are bored out of your head and its raining outside and there is nothing else tondo.
B000000W6X|5.0|one of my favorite massive attack cds.  I play this one more often than others.  Entrancing.  only a couple songs i'm not crazy about.  I just skip over those.  some of the time.  Just get any massive attack cd, and let it play in the work truck, all day long, at a low volume.  it really sounds good.
0345525558|5.0|An absolutely wonderful book that is beautifully written. I enjoyed every minute of this great book. I strongly suggest it!
B004ADH1RI|4.0|This is a fun adventure to watch with kids if they're a little older due to the language.  Having grown up in the 80's, it was fun to see these actors again.
B00992CF6W|1.0|6.99 for a stupid app that's not great my daughter wants it so bad I love mincraft solo much its stupid..
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have had difficulty with other Bible programs loading and this one is pretty consistent.  The search function is not as user friendly, but it is acceptable.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Even though it is set in a sci-fi setting, it's all about the characters not the setting. The author does a wonderful job of fleshing them out and making us care about what happens to them. And that's what truly makes a great tale in my opinion.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Only 10 levels for now, which is a shame because this is an addictive game.  Similar to 100 floors but instead of a single puzzle to open the doors you have to find the pieces to open the boxes holding the key.
B0073PPNE8|4.0|Nicole Kidman & Donald Sutherland are well cast and give fine performances but Renee Zellweger steals the show as the spunky Ruby.  I like the fact that there is no glorification of war in this film, and the horrors of the conflict are well portrayed.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I loved the movie and just had to get the DVD.  The acting is tremendous and it helped me to learn more history about England and United Kingdom.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Good story, but going off into areas that take away from the actual storyline.  The writers should stick to the story.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I have always liked the music very much.  I have seen it preformed numerous times.  The movie was very moving and gripping.  The soundtrack is very much the same way.  I really enjoy listening to it.
B000FC146C|5.0|I have read The Thorn Birds many years ago, and I think it was a PBS offering or a movie at one time as well.  I'm so glad to have it on my Kindle now, as I may re-read it.  There is so much amazing development of characters, interplay of human emotions, exposure to the Australian lifestyle of a time in its history.  It is such a rich and well developed book, a true masterpiece.<br /><br />I would give this book 10 stars if they were available to be given!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This timeless classic formatted for an android is a great read anywhere anytime! Jean Valjean's tale of contrition and redemption is a source of courage for his age or our time.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|decent game, this is basically. a Super Mario Bros clone that captures some of the original greatness<br />of the video game
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Would like to re-evaluate rating as I become more capable of using this app on my phone. I appreciate the opportunity to use and benefit from Kindle!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|We enjoyed all three of the Matt Damon Bourne movies and weren't sure about this one. But this is a great movie and a faithful continuation of the series.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a must read for every working women who has children, is thinking on having a family or entering the workforce.  Sheryl Sandberg's take on why women do not get ahead in the work place is dead on.  Not only will you have a better understanding why men continue to get the promotions and make more money but you will close the book feeling a sense of empowerment and strength.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great series ... good drama and good acting ... something you rarely get these days.  I would highly recommend it, but watch from the beginning of Season 1 so you know what's happening.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Fantastic visuals, story that's lacking at best, and acting that didn't pull you in at all. I slept through portions of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow, that's all I really have to say, wow. It works incredibly well on my Kindle Fire and I love the controls!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend because he wanted to play the &#34;Journey&#34; game.  He didn't really care too much about &#34;Flower&#34; or &#34;Flow.&#34;  Once we opened the games and started playing them, we ended up loving all three.  The graphics are great and the story lines of each game make them interesting and entertaining.  They also do not take that long to play.  If you are looking for something quick or if you have younger children with shorter attention spans, this would be a perfect 3-pack game choice.  I would recommend this set to anyone.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Good solid CD. Good songs, good lyrics, great guitar riffs. Cold Sweat is my favorite song. A bit mellower than the early stuff, but I'm a bit more mellow too! Still pretty heavy, and so Megadethesqe
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Really haven't had time to enjoy this one....but if it's as good as Angry Birds Rio, it will be most enjoyable.
0425263924|5.0|I loved book one and book two....which kept me on edge to see how the story<br />would develop. Book three was also exciting. I have re-read all of the books many times, and now I understand there will be two more books about this couple and<br />how they met, and kept their relationship going through tremendous obstacles.
1419323571|3.0|While the classic is represented here in this 1980 audio edition in full and can be appreciated on its own merits, this is a disappointing reader.  The all-important Elizabeth is very poorly done, somewhat hoarse and unpleasing.  Her sister, Jane's voice is altered from hers for distinction, but equally as unpleasing.  Ironically, I think this female reader represented Mr. Collins the best.  Disappointing and ineffective choice of reader for this edition.  It should be bargain priced.  However, for a true lover of the classics, it is not a bargain, but a waste, at any price. This is unusual for Recorded Books, which usually delivers a much more appropriate voice experience.  Carole Crawford
034580404X|5.0|Wow! You have to get the complete set of the 50 Shades Trilogy to know the whole story. So, just get the 3 book set.<br />Every time I see something on television that mentions this book series, I get a little angry.<br />The reporters never tell the complete story. The story is about two people who have a relationship.<br />It is not just about the erotic nature of their relationship, it is about them, as people and how<br />they learn to grow and change to become better people. It is about love and family, and how<br />sometimes things happen in your life, and you have to learn to make changes and adjustments.<br />We can all learn something from Christian and Ana. We can learn that surviving bad situations makes us better people.<br />And, that love comes in all forms, and that any one of us could fall in love when we least expect it to happen.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A friend lent me this book and after getting half way through I bought my own copy.  What a fresh storyline!  The world within the silo was fascinating.  I definitely look forward to reading more by Mr. Howey.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I was low on internal memory and could not figure out why, This little guy comes along and shows all of this hidden crap that I did not know as there and VI Hola I have tons of room.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Just a great, explosion-filled action flick. You don't need to think, just sit back and enjoy the show. And the president's speech is still relevant.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|...BAYONETS!!!!!<br /><br />Definitely watch this movie if you like history, and epic facial hair. I am actually only writing this part of the review to meet the word count requirement. Jeff Daniels is awesome, cheers.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|This is a very good concise read about how to mentally prepare yourself for success.  I enjoyed the straight-forward way Mr. Chopra presents the information and the material is very valid in today's work environment.  I recommend this to anyone looking for peace and tranquility in a hectic and fast-moving world.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I can't even begin to describe how addictive and awesome but it is very addictive and awesome! I have it on my iPod and kindle!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I really like this. It really does what it is/was supposed to do. Thanks, Amazon! This product does the job admirably.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games are a lot of fun. They are just challenging enough to keep you playing so you can open more games.
1451695195|5.0|I was mesmerized from the very beginning by the story and filled with hope and joy by the message. Dr. Alexander provides such a wonderful account of his time in a coma where he traveled to heaven and met his sister. It was a very positive, uplifting book to read.
1781162646|4.0|Except for the ultra-fantastic/science fiction-y books, I have read nearly everythng King has written.  In Joyland, I detect a more mellow, decidedly older, willing to &#34;out&#34; his softer side writer.  I liked the book, but not as much as &#34;The Body,&#34; the story to which it is often compared.  I think King is brilliant at depicting young, male  tweens, but not-so-much in depicting the &#34;twenty-somethinig&#34; guys.  Nevertheless, it was a great read.  I even think it would make a good film.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was very fun to play and at times a little frustrating , but just take some time and work your way through . I found my way all the way to the end and can't wait for the next Room !
B00514HDNW|3.0|More meat than the Wil Smith movie of course.  A bit ho-hum of an ending.  Perhaps I'm jaded from too many stories and movies like this.  But considering this takes place in the 70's, pretty original for its time.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|This show is so intense and exciting! Great fashions for that time and classy! I love the originality of how Atlantic City was back then!
159413586X|5.0|Excellent series. My 11 year old couldn't put it down.  Great for keeping kids interested in reading over the summer.
B0049A9BSY|5.0|I watched this show since it began back in the late 90's and loved all the fashions and all the places they went to. I love New York!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|You have to start with season 1 and you too will be hooked.  A very thrilling series.  A must watch
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|In his usual style, Dan Brown delivers a suspenseful, exciting story. Everyone who enjoys suspense should like this book. Great read!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|The movie was fantastic; however, it was not a prime video and cost me $3.99 to watch it. It was cheaper than Dish but the Amazon media player leaves much to be desired. The movie is great and Amazon is a cheap way to watch it. Prime stinks and I won't be using it anymore.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Excellent...exactly what I requested. Very surprised to find this item.  Didn't realize realize could be this small factor.  Thank you!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Watch this. It's excellent. If you like House or The Mentalist, this is the same but better. Back to the original source material but as modern as a smart phone.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game, do wish things would grow faster and got sand dollars and algee faster! I hate waiting around lol
1451696191|5.0|Great Book-would recommend to all-teenage and above<br />If you are looking for a book for teenagers to read here it is. it is a book from a teenager's point of view, how he makes friends in high school, how he copes with his best friend's suicide, and how he deals with all the aspects of high school.<br />Things discussed are: gay relationships, underage drinking, sex, drugs (mostly marijuana), dating, relationships with older adults
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I like the design of this space-saving stand and glad to get it ahead of scheduled delivery.  However, on the side edge of the back, the leather is already torn and you can see white underneath.  I'll put fray check on it.  Today is Sat. & I don't want to return it since my Kindle should be here Monday.  The defect is small, but still upsetting to pay full price for something damaged.
B003R0MF1W|4.0|Simon is full of surprises as usual.<br />Even though I consider this series to be my second best to 'Bones'<br />I am still enjoying this shows very much<br />Please keep on adding more seasons<br />Patrick
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such a good book it literally would keep me up all nite reading! But definitely well worth the sleep deprivation
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Song of Ice and Fire, book 1 is a proper page-turner. And it is true to the tv-serier (yes, I know it's the other way around). Nevertheless, I feel the book would benefit from a stronger degree of editing. A bit more density would be welcome.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game. I love to play it several times a day. It is very entertaining.and a great game to<br />Play with friends
1615470158|5.0|Love it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is really fun and very addictive. I think many other people would enjoy it. I give you a round of applause for this awesome job on coin dozer.
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|If you typically like the cast you'll like this movie.  It's more about the found in dynamics of long term or very comfortable relationship than it is about plot.  I prefer the Netflix rating system where 3 stars is &#34;like&#34; so 4 might be a bit of an overstatement on a scale of 5.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a fun break from whatever is stressing you.  There is no end,just goes faster and faster. There is no way you van p lay this g as m  and think of anything else.
B00D3V85FA|4.0|Slow, dark, and gloomy, the boys have incredibly captured their classic 1970s sound on the first album with Ozzy since 1978's &#34;Never Say Die&#34;.  As old as Ozzy is, he sounds great on this album.  Iommi sounds amazing although the 8 minute songs on this album would have been better if held to 5 minutes.  There is even a &#34;Planet Caravan Part 2&#34; song on the album (the band has admitted as much) - the trippy sound and connection to its predecessor is obvious yet it does contain some new ideas.  Definitely get the Deluxe Version for the extra songs - it's worth a few extra bucks.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can't wait for another one. It's a great puzzle game that never loses your curiosity. It's super addicting and leaves  you craving for more.
B004X4R3FE|4.0|The movie starts out a bit slowly but the acting is certainly worth the wait as the storyline unfolds.  Enjoy!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Is what I would say if it was. But, it is the absolute best.<br /><br />Pros: Great quality, great music for different maps. Just everything. The price is fairly cheap, and so are the in game buying prices. For the raging app raters out there, it has only three permissions, which are very common for apps like these. It also has two towers that aren't in computer version, which made me very happy with the game. Monkey Engineer and Heli something. I cannot remember.<br /><br />Cons: Some missions do not work, like the 4/4 wizard lord mission when you use the special ability. When you try to use it, the g a me freezes and brings you back to your phone or tablet's home screen. When you restart the game, it brings back the intro of ninja kiwi and resuming the game will bring you to the round you were on before. You still cannot use the special ability.<br /><br />Overall, I give this game a big whopping  ten mile high five &quot;budder&quot; stars. Though it has many different gameplay bugs, I give it this rating because of the gameplay experience. I hope you buy this game because this game is one of the best.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This was great when I first got it. It paired easily with my Motorola Photon and was very clear and easy to use. At that point, I would have given it 5 stars. Unfortunately, when I upgraded to the Galaxy S4, I was not able to sync it at first. For some reason, I needed to reset it and then I was able to make it work. Now it seems to work great. I leave it in my car and it syncs when I activate the bluetooth on my phone. As others have stated, it has crazy range, but since bluetooth is a battery hog, I keep it off until I need it anyway, so I really do not think it is a problem. I just have to be careful to turn off the bluetooth on my phone when I get in the house. I do not have any other bluetooth devices (except Sync in another car) that the phone is paired with, so I cannot speak to whether it would be a problem connecting to something else bluetooth within the house. It works great for my purposes.

B0002Z1EG2|4.0|I love to buy Greatest Hits albums, because they are ussually filled with the best songs from an artist, and i end up liking most of them & Don't! This slow ballad is very sweet and moving. The chorus is very haunting, and the backup singers do their job nicely.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|It's a bad sign when a book is titled \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane: A NOVEL\\". Apparently they had to tell us that it's a \\"NOVEL\\", otherwise we would never have imagined that such a slight and childish fairy tale was anything other than a minimally padded short story.<br /><br />What ever happened to the guy who wrote hefty, adult sized novels like \\"American Gods\\" or \\"Ananzi Boys\\"?<br /><br />Here's what I imagine:<br />Author, \\"I wrote this cute little kid's fairy tale. Maybe we can add some illustrations and have a great story for older children.\\"<br />Publisher, \\"Naw, you haven't churned out a novel in a while. How about you pad it up, we forget about the illustrations and we call it a novel. We can market it hard and make a million.\\"<br />Author, \\"Well, I guess so, I could use some extra cash about now.\\"
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This product is a must if you want to recharge your kindle int he computer or a converter outlet.  I had left the original one at home and needed a replacement asap, so now I have two
B008S2BZ10|5.0|Great movie to watch with the guys, I waited till mine was 14 prior to me watching it with him and he loved it!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a good book,I wasn't able to put it down. It was romantic and funny.  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Love this app! Easy to set up and use. Having the time increments on a &quot;wheel&quot; makes setting times very easy. I like the fact that i can have multiple timers.
B006QSL9XC|5.0|This review isn't about the movie, The movie is great Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should. They do an amazing job telling of a battle that shaped history. The streaming is what my review is about and it was wonderful and of Great HD quality. I can also recommend the Blu ray DVD which has the best high quality and has many extras and worth owning as well as the streaming is.
B000000OU0|3.0|NOT THEIR BEST WORK,  AND A POOR SELECTION OF SONGS. UNLIKE ONE REVIEWER, I FOUND THE FIRST FOUR TRACKS BORING AND DISMAL, AS IF THEY WERE JUST FILLERS UNTIL TJE FAVORITES ARRIVED.  EVIDENTLY, THE AUDIOPHILES WERE BLOWN AWAY BY THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE RECORDING - I PREFER GOOD MUSIC.  I AM A LONG TIME EAGLE'S FAN AND I WAS LOOKING FOR MORE. FAR FROM THE BEST CD IN MY COLLECTION IT IS THE WORST EAGLE CD I OWN. IF YOU WANT A ROCK CD WITH EVERY TRACK GREAT, TRY BOB SEGER'S  \\"STRANGER IN TOWN.\\"
B00CX1TPF0|4.0|Very good CGI.Fun characters.Very adventurous.Good family movie.A little grody in certain scenes but that's what you can expect in movies today.Nothing left for the imagination.
B009UZBLSG|1.0|I have used MHL to stream netflix for years on my old HTC sensation. I use the volume rocker to change the volume. Slimport does everything MHL does, but does not allow you to change the volume. Why does slimport not let you adjust the volume is beyond me.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Slimport does not require you to be charging your phone. (I do not use this feature)<br />Works with my Nexus 4 Bumper case just fine (Some users claim it does not fit. Theirs might not, but the one I received fits my stock Nexus 4 with bumper case)<br /><br />Con:<br />Slimport is worse than MHL.<br />Slimport costs WAY MORE than MHL. ($30 for slimport, $10 for MHL)<br /><br />The ugly:<br />Most of the time, when you are streaming over HDMI, you want to charge your phone. The \\"feature\\" of Slimport of marginal benefit. The major problem of not allowing the volume to change far outweighs any theoretical benefit of situationally wanting to stream HDMI to a TV (which will require power) and yet somehow not being able to use the TV's power source.<br /><br />Sadly, my nexus 4 has only slimport. I will use this thing anyways, but I think google screwed up for putting slimport and not MHL.
0399226907|5.0|my grandson loves this book it is one of the ones grandma has to read every time she comes over
0143039431|3.0|Ok, I won't go into a big detailed review because this book is such a classic, and already has so many reviews. I recently read this epic for the first time. I enjoyed the book, but was disappointed in the ending. It lacked finality. I also found the ending rather disgusting. I recommend this book for its historical value. The book did an excellent job of portraying the Dust Bowl migration. The movie did not do the book justice.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Nice start to a great series, I highly recommend reading the entire series.  Mixing mythologies and legends from all different cultures and smashing it together in one focal point story has been enjoyable to follow.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|To start off, this is the first game I have ever purchased bonus content through in app purchasing. I was worried I would be disappointed with the expansions, buy I was happily wrong. I play this game almost 4 hours a day. It's simple yet very complex. It's simply an amazing game that you'll spend your time happily on.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Very very helpfull! It's Difficult To Choose Yourself Every Day And Every Moment But With This Book We All Mihgt Have A Chance To Do It.<br />Thank You James For being Such An Inspiration!
B00DNLXDUW|4.0|I can't believe I paid for this app! Locked in landscape view? No customization available? They'd better do a free update and pronto on this puppy, because it's headed for the scrap heap. (Sorry for mixing metaphors.)<br /><br />REVISED: Fair is fair. After version 2.0 came out I updated and it's like night and day. It's a really good app now so I upgraded my rating from 1 star to 4 stars. My only question is, why did they put out that awful version to begin with?
0316247545|5.0|I loved the references to the fandom in it. I read it to my little cousin, and she didn't want me to stop reading it to her!
B007NZDES0|5.0|I had the &#34; Best Of Sade&#34; cd for forever.  When I started thinking that maybe they had something new out, I started to read reviews on Amazon.  So happy that I got this. Also got Soldier of Love and Lover's Rock.  Had not really been a devoted fan before.  Some reviews suggested that she does too much in the love genre, but really, is there a whole lot else really worth singing about anyway?! Was totally impressed with the extras after the concert.  Really illustrates a level of personality and overall good vibes that is just uncommon.  Lyrics are simply to the point and sometimes trance-like (Love Is Found).  Musicians are 50% of the magic of the group Sade.  I will be sad if she/they ever stop or if they don't come out with some more new stuff asap.  10 stars if I could!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Lots of twists & turns!! Will keep you guessing. Can't wait to move on to the next book in the series!
B008FOB124|2.0|I had hoped that they would have come out with something new...sadly disappointed with DCD on this release.  This one will take a place on the pile of cd's that never seem to get played again.  Still enjoy some of their other cd's.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game SOOOO much! I would recommend this game for anyone and i am thrilled that the new 0.7.1 just came out!!!
B006M4F67A|4.0|I like Mahjong, so this app is great too. Only 1 thing that I don't care for is there are 3 matches of everything instead of the 2 I'm used to.
B001IF252C|5.0|I previously had the Monoprice adapter and it only lasted 10 months.  Amazon now has a good price on the Apple adapter, so I purchased this one.  It has been working like a charm with no issues with my Macbook Pro.  This adapter gives me a 2560 x 1600 display on my external 30&#34; Cinema display.<br /><br />For the people who have had an issue with wake from sleep, the USB connector on these adapters are for power only.  If you plug that into your laptop/desktop that goes to sleep, the needed power is not available on wakeup causing the issue with the display.  Plug that USB into a powered USB Hub or spare USB wall charger and you will no longer have any issue when waking up from sleep.
B000000H6Y|4.0|I just found out about Type O Negative about a year ago and really like the different heavy flavors they have to offer, this album is like the rest, some good and some not so good
B00A9C3RNQ|1.0|I watched this with my parents. It was totally embarrassing listening to Meryl Streep talk about her sexual fantasies with Tommy Lee Jones. The movie was slow and plodding, and altogether not enjoyable.... not recommended.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is not my first or last purchase.  Amazon is the only place I shop online.  Love the speed of service and the quality of the product, from dog treats to people food and of course your number 1 in my book.<br /><br />Thank you<br />Lela Fowler
B0026QC0TA|3.0|watching matt damon is always a pleasure, and he even did a passable southern accent! not a great movie, but a good one
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I have erased everything from my kindle fire and it wont download. I keep getting an error message that I don't have enough storage space. I removed 30 games over 100 books and I have netflix and kingdoms at war left, that's it what kind of bs is this, I want to play the game, I want to spend my money, but you wont let me? have you heard of a cloud server? unroll this is fixed you get jack from me. I am a long time mtg player and I am very pissed off. wotc fix this please.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I have watched first 10 episodes of season 1 so far... got hooked after first couple of episodes and liking it so far...
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I liked the movie.  It's one of those you really need to pay attention to detail or you won't get it all, unless you watch it with someone who has already seen it!
B004UXY5D6|5.0|Love the sound, was looking for something new... I'm going to check out their other EP's as well.  That's all.
B001NLKWLW|3.0|A 5-year old girl arrives in colonial Australia all alone.  Years later, she and her granddaughter try to find out the mystery of her origin in England.  Many different characters over a period of many years, and your sympathies veer from one character to another.  Sometimes it becomes hard to follow.
B0016NF06O|5.0|Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already<br /><br />He has done country and western (of course), and reggae, now blues.  And why not?  And you have two world-class musicians collaborating on a project.  The result is a must have cd for fans of either artist.  I cannot believe how good this cd is.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Mr. Marsalis or Mr. Nelson and not sure if you will like it - believe me - you will.  If you don't get it, you will regret it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It is ok...there is still fire between them but more tame now. Still some lose ends that I hope will be solved in the coming books ...but should have said from the start is a 5 series book instead of a trilogy. Somewhat disappointed.
B002P7UCMC|4.0|Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.<br /><br />I like their earlier stuff better.  But that's just me.  This just doesn't seem to have that martial drive to it as some of their other releases had.<br /><br />The one cd of theirs that I hold as the gold standard is Mutter.  And this is not it.  Again - it is not a bad release, but just not up to their earlier stuff.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|liked game but a couple areas were a little difficult to understand...had to use help and still didn't understand how that area was supppose to be solved.  will look forward to new levels.
B000ZELISO|5.0|Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.<br /><br />Having read all the HP books and watched all the HP movies, I must say that I am impressed.  Yes, the movies leave a lot of stuff out of them - but think about it - how long would the movies have been had they followed the book exactly?<br /><br />Given that, the movies, even though a series, can stand on their own individually.  Of course, it does help if you watch them as intended.<br /><br />The naysayers will bellyache about the acting.  To which I say &#34;Get over it.&#34;  This has been one of the most successful franchises in print and movie history and it leave two-bit series like twilight in the dust.
B0045MRLCE|5.0|The Band Perry is a surprise, with eloquent lyrics and well-crafted songs and a singer who uses her voice as an instrument.  This album makes you think of all the drama, the rich flavors of love and the bitter tang of lost relationships.  The songs really speak of human nature and such genuine feelings that everyone can appreciate...you cannot help but think of the relationships and people of your life as you hear the Perrys sing.  I wonder if, when Kimberly Perry gets married, the songs will dry up?  The songs seem to be from her perspective primarily, but then again her brothers may have a lot of input into the words as well but, since she is the lead singer the songs are from a girl's point of view?<br /><br />Some people criticize Kimberly's voice as \\"too clean to be emotive\\" but I disagree.  She can and does use her voice as an instrument. This was the first Band Perry album.  I highly recommend that anyone who likes this one will likely love the second.<br /><br />Actually, the Henningsens (another family group) basically co-wrote this album - the band that released the EP \\"American Beautiful.\\"  The Perrys are two brothers and a sister, the Henningsens are a dad, son and daughter.  Their influence on the album speaks well of their future as a touring country act.  At the time the album was being produced, Clara Henningsen was single but has since married.<br /><br />In any event, this is a country music album but it has the chops to produce crossover success.  There are rocking guitars that kick up the jams beyond a typical country album.  But then country music is incorporating more rocking sounds these days, and as country and blues were ancestral to rock music I supppose we are coming full circle?
B000UFAURI|4.0|Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.<br /><br />If I had graded this when I first got it, it would have received 5 stars.  But given time, it is just off some of their earlier releases.  I still highly recommend this cd though.<br /><br />Dave Grohl and the rest of the band continue to mature as musicians and songwriters and it is nice to listen to them through the years as they continue on their journey.<br /><br />So, don't be shy about getting this one if you haven't purchased it already.  You can't go wrong with this.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. A good way to unwind! Don't think it's necessary to buy the full version though
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.<br /><br />I have always liked Bruce Springsteen.  The quality of his writing and music have always been top notch.  That being said, there is something that is missing here, and I cannot quite put my finger on it.  Suffice to say though that this is still a superior release when compared to 99.99% of the dreck that is played in radio today.<br /><br />I do recommend this CD, but not as much as I would others.
B000PA9Q6E|5.0|Not only do you get to hear Muddy, James and Johnny hamming and jamming - Pinetop Perkins is also on this CD...its fabulous
B000001E8S|5.0|Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Brian Eno since &#34;Here Come the Warm Jets.&#34;  And this release is right up there with his others.  There is just something relaxing about his music.  And he is an artist who you either really like or cannot stand.<br /><br />I slip this cd in with &#34;Music for Airports&#34; and kick back.
159463176X|4.0|I loved The Kite Runner so had great expectations for Hosseini's latest offering. I wasn't disappointed. I found myself going to bed early so I could continue this gripping read. I love insights by a native of another culture; glimpses into a hitherto unseen world. Helped me understand a culture, information about which there's not much for us Westerners. Good on you Khaled Hosseini! More please.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.<br /><br />I have liked Annie Lennox since I first heard and saw her on MTV (when they used to actually show music videos).  Her voice is as good as ever.  Why not 5 stars then?  I hold &#34;Diva&#34; as the benchmark.  And as good as this release is, it isn't &#34;Diva.&#34;<br /><br />I still highly recommend this cd to anyone who appreciates a great voice and really good music.
B001DUDKEY|3.0|Too slow moving and kind of dull.  Liked the period of time the movie was set in and also the clothes.
B000OT6V00|5.0|Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.<br /><br />Ron Pearlman is so good it's scary.  I cannot recommend this movie enough to people.  Fantasy, adventure, action, and some drama thrown in.  And I think this is a better movie than the second one.<br /><br />Even my kids and grand kids like this.  It cuts across the age and genre barriers easily, and leaves everyone satisfied.  And the movie is one that gets watched more than once - so you might as well buy it and save yourself some money from having to drive to the video store and renting it several times.
0312330537|5.0|This is a very interesting book!  It is the first book that has taken me so long to finish!  There are so many interesting things in it that I read it more slowly so I don't miss a thing!  I have told so many other people to get and read it!
B00158K0S8|5.0|Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.<br /><br />This is just one of the best movies ever.  George C. Scott deserved his Academy Award for his portrayal of General Patton.<br /><br />Is it totally accurate?  Of course not - but it does show the genius and shortcomings of one of the greatest Generals of all time.<br /><br />The transfer to blue ray is fantastic.  Great job!
1881273873|5.0|Reminder to us that thinking about others goes a long way to improving life's out come, at least by knowing that you gave it your best shot.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|boooooo!<br /><br />Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.<br /><br />Good script, good acting, well shot.  What isn't there to like?<br /><br />Too bad the entire cast could not have gotten an academy award for their portrayals in this masterpiece of movie making.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I should be in bed now, but I Can't stop playing. Great graphics and sound too. I might even buy the full game.
B000UJBYD8|5.0|Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.<br /><br />This release by the Cult just confirms that they are one of the premier groups around.  The vocals, music, lyrics and production are top notch.<br /><br />This is a must have for any Cult fan.  And if you have never purchased a cd from them, what are you waiting for?
B000MR9D5E|5.0|What a wonderful series!  A magnificent presentation of the wonders of our planet.  I like to watch it with my great grandchildren.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.<br /><br />From Dire Straits on, have been a fan of Mark Knopfler.  This release is no exception.  He really isn't a &#34;singer&#34; but his guitar playing?  That is another thing altogether.<br /><br />This is a top notch production from start to finish.  I like to put some of his releases in the cd players, hit start, kick back, relax, and go to that happy place.<br /><br />If you want to do the same thing, by all means purchase this CD - and the rest of his catalog.
0770437400|5.0|The documentary like personal description of the events is very effective, you simply forget that the author is depicting events that are a complete fiction. I highly recommend this book, don't dare go see the Hollywood &#34;rape&#34; of the title before you read this. very immersive, well written, enjoyable horror.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each episode of the series (seasons 1-3) held my interest.  When one episode ended I couldn't wait to start the next.  Interesting plots. Great characters. Facinating peek at the intereaction between the classes in England.<br /><br />The Dowager Countess, played by Maggie Smith may be my favorite fictional character in any movie/tv series ever.
B009PJXY3M|5.0|Totally not what I was expecting from a &#34;Disney Darling&#34;, but I do wish she would re-release an acoustic version of this album!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|The movie delivered. It was better than what the trailers indicated. Filled with great action scenes. Never a dull moment.
B00CBBXOQ8|4.0|Loved his first song and the radio and decided to buy the entire album.  So worth it and he should have a bright future
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I like the style it was written in. Like a continuous interview not a first person story. Love me some zombies!
1592536913|5.0|I really like this book, very interesting and fun to look at.  It is well organized and the images are excellent. It also gives great ideas.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Dragons look so cute and change looks as they grow. Time consuming and addicting game but enjoyable. Graphics are great. Level up fast at first then it takes longer.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game and it's very addicting! You don't have to be a fan of Jaws to like this game.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This movie was great fun.  Love the girls and the minions are a riot.  I was one of the first in line to see 2 this weekend which was very good as well.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Here is a record that is a night and day difference from its nemesis \\"Frequency Unknown\\" by Geoff Tate and The Queensryches. From start to finish you find the missing link between Rage For Order and Operation Mindcrime. It's not as catchy and well written as Empire was but it is a pretty damn good shot at it and to be honest with you that is saying something these days because QR has been downright terrible since Tribe which really threw the band off of a cliff and damaged the name so badly it made you basically not care any longer about the band. Q2K still had life in it and I did not mind Promised Land or HITNF either. The rest has been pure trash including a VERY LAME Operation Mindcrime 2.<br /><br />Welcome back QR. Now start hopping on some tours as openers and let new crowds discover you because this is a start from scratch new band now. Do yourself a favor and never look Tate's way again....it's PAINFULLY obvious he was the reason you guys were putting out such junk for the last decade.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Martin's, once again has written this book with you wanting more at the end.......can't wait for book five. Dances with Dragons.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this was one if the best books I have ever read. I could barely put it down. I can't wait to get the third book.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was one of the most intriguing books I have ever read. Kate Morton was masterful in weaving the tales that came together in the end.
B004SEUIXS|4.0|This is movie is cute, cute, cute, strange, but cute.  I don't think Hollywood is capable of making such a funny, quirky, bizarre and fun movie as this. Perhaps Woody Allen would be the only Hollywood director who might come close.  For one thing, in classic French form, this movie has things about sex which only a foreign film would ever show in a such a humorous way.  It has strange eccentric characters, like her neighbor she spies on who is always working on copying the famous Renoir painting The Boating Party, which he as copied like 20 times.  The entire movie is a kaleidoscope of eccentric people who live in Paris.  And the movie has a very cute plot of how Amelie, shy in her own life, constantly tries to help others.  The whole movie takes a fun twist as she discovers a box from long ago that is filled with memorabilia by a boy, and she decides to return it.  As you can tell, the story just has a lot of fun and quirky side stories that makes it entertaining.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou is so adorable.  I wouldn't rate this movie as a 5 star because that would be putting it right up there with her very best movies.  But it is a true delight and if you want something that will just make you smile and laugh and periodically go, \\"What the hell is going on?\\", all while beaming from ear to ear as the cutest actress in the world enchants you, then this movie will do it.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou is utterly adorable and Amelie shows off just how cute she is.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun to play and not too difficult to learn.  just wish there were more levels<br />great value for price. would recommend over doors
0399255370|5.0|I can't wait to read this at my next storytime.  Like most great kids books, it is funny not only to the kids, but to the kids at heart.  Who doesn't relate using crayons the same way Duncan does? And of course, you throw in a kids version of a \\"naked\\" crayon (one whose paper has been peeled away and now must \\"hide\\" in the box) you have a sure fire laugh out loud book for the kids. Great to see something new and funny! I put this up there with my David Shannon and Mo Willems books as sure hits at reading time!
B003XMKMTQ|4.0|I have a handful of these Clapton sponsored festivals and like the others, Eric manages to attract a wide spectrum of musicians, all of which have a guitar as a primary instrument.  And as John Mayer says in an early, between sets interview, \\"These are not week-end guitar players.\\"  Indeed.<br /><br />I can't imagine anyone who would be totally satisfied with all the performers because Clapton has a diversified line-up.  Certainly the focus is on blues as it usually is.  I've heard from more than one guitarist who said that Clapton may be best remembered as the man who introduced the blues to America.  He being British and the blues being an American based musical genre, which is quite a statement, if based in fact.<br /><br />I do have a couple beefs however, so let's get those out of the way.  One of my favorite guitarists and one of the most original, is Pat Metheny.  And while you can see him mixing it up with other musicians backstage, he's nowhere to be found on this DVD.  Instead we get a very long song by Indian artist Vishwa Mohan Bhatt who opens the second disc, followed shortly thereafter by Larry Carlton playing \\"Josie\\" a 1984 smooth jazz hit that has been played to death, and few care about in 2004.  Former Whitesnake guitarist Steve Vai seemed to be getting the biggest response from the audience in the whole festival, yet he was relegated to only one song here.<br /><br />On Disc 1, I found the order a bit unusual.  There doesn't seem to be any sequence as the acts go from night time to day time, then back to night.  Just a bit weird.  But quibbles aside, this is always a great show to catch on DVD/Blu ray no matter the venue.  And Clapton moves things around.  This show also highlights Clapton guitar more than on those that followed.  Here he also pays homage to Texas - takes place in the Dallas Cotton Bowl - by closing the show with some great work by ZZ Top.  I can't wait for the next version (fall of 2013 I think) on Blu ray.
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|Still a nice sincere voice, and good but not great songs. Unfortunately, B and B cannot get involved writing for her, as things would quickly get out of hand;
B007ZXK08C|5.0|such a great way to write, it really keeps you guessing right to the end. I was enthralled and totally caught up in it. marvellous read.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|For me, not enough of what I expected. Heft.<br />Did love the idea of the Hempstocks & Lettie's line \\"But you stayed where you were meant to be... That's quality, that is.\\" Especially since right before \\"The second thing I thought was that I knew everything.\\"<br />All in all, cleverly done and enjoyed the voicing. Just not strong enough to draw me completely under the spell.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|How many ways can I say that I love this book? Why did I wait so long to read it? I love the relationship between the main characters... and of course the enforcers are great... Loved it!! Started off with this book as an introduction into Thea Harrison's world and I have officially added her on my list as one of my fav paranormal romance authors!
B00340ESIS|5.0|While focused on screenwriting, this also works well to inform novelists in marketable story structure and, to a lesser degree, provides guidance on seeking out an agent. Blake's Board and Beat Sheet are some of the most useful storytelling tools I've encountered. He delineates his creative process in simple, clear terms, and establishes guidelines the can help any writer clarify her story.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael sings wonderful songs and is a superior entertainer.  His music and singing is new and crisp but still renders that nostalgia that I love.
B005I6EVUG|3.0|Love the cover however wish the actual Kindle had more protection. The elastic bands hold it in but barely! If its dropped the Kindle will fall out and the outer edges will get damaged at the least. Worst case scenario the elastic doesn't hold and the kindle gets damaged a great deal. Would've lived more of a sleeve so the kindle has the protection it needs
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|Great music by a great singer.  His voice still sounds great.  Brings back many terrific memories.  Paul Anka still has it!!!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Love Khaled Hosseini. His first. Two books were brilliant. As you can imagine, the writing in this book is excellent. However, this is a book of interconnected short stories. I felt a bit duped when i discovered that about 40 percent in. Some stories great. Others not. Worth reading but just know what you are in for
B005N4F48Q|2.0|Although containing some interesting performances, the script plays less well than the Ken Burns documentary, and the sound track DEMANDS that you pay attention to Important Moments.  As good an actor as Sheen is, he is woefully miscast as Lee.  We never see the Southern Hothead momentarily come out in him that leads to such a tragically lame-brained decision as ordering Picket's Charge.  It is a desperate throw of the dice that leads to a Greek Tragedy, but it is played though it were the choice of items on a fast food breakfast menu.  Daniels does a good job as Chamberlain, an Eliot does well as Burns, but the movie feels almost as long as the actual battle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome and my 9 year old daughter would ply it all day if we would let her.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Book is very easy to understand and it gives you step by instructions on how to set up your own system.  I am planning to set up a system of my own in my basement.  I am really excited about the entire venture.  In addition, I am planning to recommend this book to others.  Great read and a must have for your library.
B001E95ZI8|5.0|It was a classic movie by Rain Wilson and needs to be seen by more people who like his humor.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely top drawer.  Great acting, always the unexpected twists, superb costumes and scenery.  One of the best series ever.  Highly recommend it.
B0072HXVRS|5.0|I'm not really positive what this thing is, but its flippin sweet. I love the dang thing, and always the first thing I pick when my girls ask me to play fairies with them.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Have this on my Kindle Fire, can't figure out the directions. Other reviews said it needed more directions, how about some directions.
0307913090|1.0|I got this audiobook after seeing Game of Thrones series 1. Unfortunately I had to stop listening when Tyrion Lannister appeared. Tyrion's a little guy but Peter Dinklage,who plays him in the HBO production, gives him a magnificent voice that vastly increases his stature way beyond his physical appearance.  Roy Dotrice gives him a squeaky, yorkshire accented, midget caricature voice that's totally out of keeping with the character IMO. Roy's voice for Tyrion may change as the book progresses but his first appearance killed it for me.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Very typical for Quentin Tarantino so I enjoyed this movie, especially the performance by Christoph Waltz. He should've received a Best Actor Oscar instead of Suppportive. Brilliant performance.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|better than i thought it would be for a classic film. great entertainment. acting was awesome, great purchase for the money.
B00884GR0W|5.0|OK I had this as the app of the day and at that point it was at 1.5v now 6 months later its at 7.0.5v thats awsome. It is updated so often and there not just little things too. My only caomplant with the game is I cant ride my horse and no friendly dragons.<br /><br />One of my friends got mincraft pocket addtion and said it was horriable i told him try block story and he cant put it down. It is truly a great game you should get it.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|better than i thought it would be for a classic film. great entertainment. acting was awesome, great purchase for the money.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|purchased this for the kids 8 and 9 yrs old.  They are addicted to playing, making new creations is amazing for them
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I started reading this series because I finished the 50 Shades Trilogy,  I think it is a great series so far in comparison
B003E88TKS|5.0|Aside from the interesting romantic twist wound throughout the movie (a player being played), this movie should be required viewing by high school seniors on graduation day. And should be part of management courses in college. This is the side of corporate America that politians want to remain under covers.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|A great  read and Rollins always makes it fun.Fast paced adventure,treasure seeking,and a little romance----what's not to like? Buy it,read it you won't be disappointed..
B005GSVFB4|5.0|This is the film that started it all. I love Pixar and am collecting all of them on Blu ray. great for all ages
B00371XIJE|2.0|I was disappointed with the movie. I am told this is based on a true story, but this version is beyond believable. It just never worked for me but it did crush my nine year old son. It was quite sad but I think they could have done more with the material.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|It is great to see a kids film with little monolague and still be this excellent. Great for the kids and a great film to add to the Pixar Blu Ray collection.
0062071017|5.0|Don't be fooled by some of the reviews that say this is nothing more than the basic MBA material or simply a book on Strategy. Cynthia Montgomery has captured the very essence of what is required to move a business to the next level and while it might be based on years of teaching and research at Harvard Business School it the message that underlies each story, tool and technique that is missed by the majority of MBA students.<br /><br />The book has a very easy to follow and great style. Analogies are well thought through, develop into the teaching method nicely and follow the case-in-point style of learning. In fact I found myself often relating each of the examples back to my own business and realising where the fundamentals of the business need to be worked on. But back to the book...the message is relatively simple:<br /><br />- Have a clear, well defined and meaningful purpose;<br />- Create alignment within the business;<br />- Understand the fundamentals that drive success with in alignment with the purpose;<br />- Remember that strategy development start on day 1 and never ends...there is simply no end point where strategy is 'completed'.<br /><br />The wrap up of the book is simple...to be a strategist you must first be a leader...strategy never ends, it is a continuous cycle process where we have a core purpose, a driving forces, a reason for living and we consider how that reason changes the world. This makes it easy to change, adapt and move through the challenges that a competitive landscape offers. From Gucci to IKEA, both businesses had their fair share of challenges and issues...but the ever evolving art of strategy lead them through to be the businesses they are today. Often thanks to the leadership but always thanks to the purpose!<br /><br />So yes...this appears to be MBA 101 but think about it...how many MBA graduates do you know that would not land a job in your business, be able to lead and develop a business to great heights or simply are text book managers but not strategic leaders. The Strategist is aimed squarely at anyone that thinks they know all about strategy because they have an MBA...after all many great strategist do not have an MBA yet we teach their thinking and refer to their success in many MBA classes. This is a great book and yes...I have an MBA and still found myself in awe of the author, the approach and the learnings I took out of this book.<br /><br />A must read for every business person and one that I am sharing with my Leadership Team!
B005GSVFBE|5.0|Another great installment for Pixar. A must have on Blu Ray! great for all ages as everyone will enjoy this film.
B0066WJLU6|2.0|was not very bright I had expected it to act as as flash light it did not only lite the screen
B005COO1X6|5.0|King at his usual best.  I have been a fan since Carrie and will always be one.  He is, in my estimation, a great writer.
B00BHU261S|4.0|Very interesting movie. It was an aspect of his life and his relationship with his wife that i was unaware of.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I think Bruce Willis is terrific.  Love the irony, action and escapism of the Die HArd movies.  How they totally missed the mark with this boring, senseless abomination is staggering.  There are few if any funny lines or situations.  The pretext is absurd (which is expected but this is beyond silly).  There is no character development or discerable story line.  The movie was a waste of 90 minutes of my life.  Would ahve been better off with reruns of Law and Order.  Do not bother.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is fun and relaxing. There are many different ways you can play it so there is something for everyone.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|The best show on TV in my opinion, there is not much left to say about game of thrones other than it is truly epic and brilliant. I haven't read the books and i'm holding off on doing so simply because i don't want to spoil TV that is so far ahead of the rest. superb
B0097AQEOK|4.0|It's a great deal for some classic music. I like the idea of mini original album covers....in theory...but in reality, it's almost impossible to read anything that small!
0385751532|5.0|I seen this movie on TV so i told my daughter this is a good book to read for school.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun and addictive.  I enjoy playing this game. It was very entertaining while I waited at DMV for 2 hours.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like the challenge this app provides, going beyond other similar games I have played.  I appreciate the free game, but  I thought there would be more levels ready to go.  I seem to only have access to a limited number.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the way many people were/are tied together, was a little sad at the end to not know &#34;everything&#34; - the book leaves you wanting more
B00BESM14U|3.0|A couple parts in reference to a gay teen, 1 or 2 parts where there is a small kiss.  A couple references of teens on drugs.  Not a movie for a young child but okay
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I truly enjoy this app.  It was worth the money I invested in it.  Nothing like something that is easy to use, does what is promises and not too bad a price.  I fully recommend this product.  I can NO LONGER promote this product.<br /><br />The company did an update.  Sadly the update turned off the sound.  It will play when setting up the alarm, but when it is time for the alarm to go off it only flashes.  I have emailed and they said they would look into the issue.  When the problem is fixed I will gladly give a five star rating again.<br /><br />Okay after I emailed the company and only one response of, \\"We will look into this.\\"  I waited.  It was after doing some research on the internet and other things that I did some tweaking and reinstalled the program I have it working.<br /><br />I am only giving it a 3 because of the customer response.  It seems once they get your money that you don't matter.  Sad too, because over all the app is good when it is working.
B00AFZ86BA|5.0|BOGUS not remastered, just repackaged and re-released thru Rhino. If you already have the originals, don't waste your money folks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game on my Kindle! It is just like playing it on a computer. I recommend this version of the classic game to anyone who just wants to keep their mind busy!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Ive bought all the magic the gathering games before this and have loved them all so far. Was really excited when they said they were coming out with an android version and sealed play. So far i haven't been disappointed. The game is solid for a tcg on a android. If you're a veteran to these games you should more than love what they've done to the game. If you're new and not sure about picking it up, give it a shot its free and very easy game to learn but a lifetime to master and if you like it then drop a few bucks and unlock the full thing.
B006LSZECO|2.0|My book club chose this book to read and I had NO CLUE about this book. Never even heard of it. This is a back-and-forth book. Chapter about him,  chapter about her, etc. The plot was actually pretty good; a good murder mystery, a little bit of psycho drama, a seemingly guilty-from-the-start leading man, etc. BUT - every other word is the 'F' word, and so I had to wade through all that crap to follow the story line. I mean, the entire book would have been about 50 pages shorter if she cut out the 'F' word; and believe me, it wouldn't have changed the story whatsoever. An occasional use of the word would have been more believable, but it was WAY overused. Kind of like someone that doesn't cuss trying to give a bad-boy impression to someone, and they use every curse word they ever heard in one sentence; which ends up sounding completely stupid and being very transparent. Then, it ended on a foul note. I was like, \\"What? That's it? That's how she ends this 400+ page book that I really didn't want to finish???\\" I was, to say the least, let down big time with the pitifully weak ending. Not a fan. Sorry.
B006O5Y75Y|3.0|Great storyline, but the story is not developed. The cgi was great, but I was impressed more with it than the story.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The story continues to hold your attention and throw you a few curve balls along the way.  Takes a few turns that you don't expect!
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|Gameplay is still fun, but certain things have changed that might make your experience less than enjoyable.<br /><br />To get perfect scores, you will HAVE to return to every level at least TWICE. You cannot get a perfect score AND collect the level's gem in the same go. If you want the reward for quick-timed level completion, you may have to play the same level again, and again, until you know all of the moves by heart. To get the achievement for the first prologue level, I had to complete it in less than 5 seconds. That's easy enough to do on level 1 where there are 4-6 moves to memorize, but imagine later, when you'll have 30+ moves.... Not so easy then!<br /><br />I find it interesting how you have to \\"rub the dust off\\" of pictures... but it gets tiresome after awhile. In game, you'll find pictures that you'll need to dust off for NO reason. You can't collect the picture, and it's usually too small to see fine details. Maybe there's a point, but I haven't found it.<br /><br />Mechanics are about the same. The \\"raindrop\\" itself stay true to the original. I'm not sure if anyone else noticed, but Memento starts off at about the halfway point of Reflect (With the female/male crates and golden pearls). Maybe the difficulty curve will be sharper? Looking forward to the challenge!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I like it very much.It,s very use full to buy ebooks for my Acer iconia tab.  Also for a lot of other things like you tub,dictionaries,
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I had read and enjoyed &#34;Gone Girl&#34; by Gillian Flynn so decided to try another of her novels.  Very good choice and I intend to read more of Ms. Flynns work
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|This is worth seeing for the cast alone. But, combined with Tarantino's writing, it really is a gem.  The scene with Hopper and Walken is brilliant.
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|Captures you through out, from beging  to the end, a soft gentelness from this fine youmg man and woman. touchesmy heart
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|great game I can kill hours on this game.  my 3 year old daughter even loves playing this game.  keep up the great work
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game because it has the right amount of easy and hard. Sometimes I had to go on youtube and see how to get past part of a puzzle but other than that you will always have a blast with can you escape. It defiantly keeps me occupied when I'm bored :)
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love the game has a few glitches though. It sometimes freezes up and you lose coin, credits, and your bingo items. Even with the problems, it is one of my favorites.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved the movie, I like who they got all the super hero's to work together.  I would recommend this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Awesome read, I read it in 2 days kept me intrigued as all Sylvia books do. Definitely would recommend. Can't wait for the next one in the series to come out.
B0059WTMLW|3.0|maybe if you are really into sudoku it might be fine but I find it kind of boring so I may not be a good judge. But, hey, you asked
B0086213XW|5.0|This movie felt as though I was watching a friend or myself day to day. It never went off on any unrealistic adventures or endings. It was very emotional. And it show a topic that happens everyday but is not alwaysooked at from this way.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so much fun. I cant wait for the new update! I hope its as fun as the other levels.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|I don't know who would want to rate this film less than 5 stars! It's a classic with a feel good story and amazing dancing.
B0018LMZOE|4.0|A classic and a very nostalgic listening pleasure. Would recommend to any Moody Blues fan. Audio quality reasonable for this oldie.
B002O2THRO|2.0|Best part is just seeing a handsome Robert Redford.  I thought Mia Farrow was terrible, not a very good actress. Movie story was really slow, not much &#34;meat&#34; to it at all.
0452295548|5.0|I choose the book because a close friend has just had a stroke on the left side of the brain.  It was recommended by a stroke victim.  I have gotten so much insight into the workings of the 2 hemispheres of the brain and what the recovery journey is like for the stroke victim. Wow, what a story.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I loved it but you have to keep in mind it is a NOVEL, with exaggeration, but some basis of what really went on during those times. Very graffic and bloody also.  Love, loved , loved Leo DeCaprio and also Jamie Foxx - both were excellent in it. Also Christopher Waltz and Samuel L Jackson were very good.  You have to keep in mind it is a Terrantino movie and it you don't like his movies you won't like this one either.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is the best movie. I love it. This is the first movie myself and my son watched in 4D theatre in Cincinnati. My son loved a lot. Most of the time he thrilled and try to catch the chocolate drink and snow flakes. Its really good movie.
1609611543|5.0|There is no way that I can put into this review all that I've been through in my life as I've tried to lose weight. Think extreme and I've done it all. My biggest challenge, ALWAYS, has been carbs. If there was a piece of bread in the house, it was mine. I found this book, in a roundabout way, and decided to read it because I was bored. Wow! For the first time, I understood why I absolutely, positively just HAD to eat that chunk of leftover bread (or bag of chips). Even if it was after I'd gone to bed, I'd get up just to polish off whatever was \\"calling\\" me.<br /><br />It was only recently that all of that bad behavior was catching up. Despite an extreme method of weight loss, I'd put back on about 30 pounds and was despairing of ever feeling healthy again. Worse, I was beginning to have \\"carb comas\\" after going out to eat and having spaghetti and bread. It would get so bad that I'd fall asleep for a couple of hours. The final straw, for me, was feeling nauseous and tired, all at once.<br /><br />I don't know how my journey will end since I've ony been following this for a month, but the 4 week results are pretty spectacular...I've lost 2 inches from my waist and one on the hips. More importantly, I DON'T CRAVE CARBS. Yesterday, I went to my favorite Italian restaurant and stuck to their amazing salad...which comes with even more amazing bread. I ate half the salad and took the rest home. I didn't even a single piece of bread and didn't miss it. Whoo hoo!<br /><br />The best results aren't on the scale, but in the clothes. When you start putting on the clothes that you hid in the closet because you outgrew them, well, that's a feeling that you just can't describe.<br /><br />For the first time ever, I don't feel like I'm following the latest fad. Even though Dr. Davis gets a bit more technical than is necessary for the average reader, the fact is that the science and research are all laid out for you to see and BELIEVE.<br /><br />Dr. Davis is my hero!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is so much fun.  I really enjoy competing with my friends to see which one of us has the highest score.  I also enjoy the posts that we can make back and forth.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This is my first ever one star rating but I have to say the first two books were well written and a good story, however, this book did not have either. The author turned two strong smart characters into immature, week, and senseless people.  Gideon became careless and un appealing, Eva became even more of a crazed drama queen who cannot think for herself, actually neither Eva nor Gideon could think on their own. Nothing but sex no storyline or plot. The sex scenes were repetitious and seemed very immature not hot and heavy.  I forced myself to finish what I started and as I thought the book just suddenly ended. When you do not have direction or a plot you have to end this way because there was never a good stopping point. Really wished I listened to other bad reviews and stopped at second book, but I really wanted to see Eva and Gideon get back together, they should stay apart. Gideon is better off without drama queen Eva.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Simple. Cute. Addictive. Fun. One of those games to just pass the time. Except you find yourself playing...and playing...and playing.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|And, Ladies and Gentlemen with those powerful words; the proud and honerable self-righteous Steven Seagal voluntarily killed himself off, in this all out action flick from directors Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis. Only the great Steven Seagal can walk around non-chalet with an eighteen inch machete blade embedded into his stomach and still to keep talking sh**t. Machete the movie is an absolute bizzarre master piece of film making. I loved every minute of it! It won't be nominated for a day time Emmy award any time soon, that's for sure. So when you get the chance, check it out for yourselves. You'll be greatly entertained.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Enjoyable passes time fast fun fun fun fun gets kids moving should be making people buy the game because it's fun
B004WJREMW|5.0|A complicated album,a very different Album that you would hear and not expect. I like it!, the songwriting is different to.an album he self played all the instruments.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game. I downloaded it not knowing how it would be. I usually don't enjoy playing the games in which you have to build a community and grow plants, I've downloaded many, and this one above all is my favorite. In the game you grow crops and bake bread, cheese, and so far jelly but that's as far as I've gotten. You can get milk, eggs and other produce from your animals and sell them or make something with it. I enjoy this game and hope you do too. Thanks for reading. :)
B004WJRF6C|5.0|His first self played (all the instruments )album,when the beatles broke up and it's good too!.His first single,some songs with just music.His first songs without his songwriting team.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Once again, Minecraft has succeeded in blowing me away. While it's not quite the same, it is a nice little addition to the Minecraft family. It's a little of getting started, what with the mobile controls, but once you get going, is just as addictive as all the others.
B007L96VCY|5.0|Very good album, colorful,visual,songs.country songs mix with orchestration.a classic album.with his wife linda are good together (vocals).Great studio musicians that play on the album.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Love the app, buy every time I get a message, it will not load!Same as notifications. I don't know if this is for everyone..but in my opinion the problem should be addressed for anyone with this, to properly enjoy the app.<br /><br />..
B009GEEMLY|4.0|The movie was really good, but slow in a couple of spots. The comedy was good sprinkled throughout the movie.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is the best show on TV!!! It's a must watch for any body who loves zombies or just a great show
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was great fun and I hope it continues very soon. It was very challenging and different on every level.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a really cool game.  It's a neat one for my girls to begin to get a picture of what it may be like having a horse. Obviously, the physical labor isn't present, but the idea of what labor would be required is fairly accurate. The only disappointing aspect is the freezing. This game does tend to freeze up quite a bit.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is so fun and entertaining to play when I am bored. It is so easy to pick up. Definitely worth five stars!
B002RI9HUM|4.0|I was gripped with this book. Marian Keyes always writes with humour and depth and this book is no exception.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Wasn't as compelling as his first two.  Lots of switching back & forth in time.  Was confusing.  OK, but doubt that I would continue to read his books.  Loved the first two!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Mincemeat it is a cool game I play it all the time I hope more people get this game
B009MYARIK|4.0|Kinsella has such a great way with characters and plot lines!  &#34;Can't put it down&#34;. I've read all her books. Love them all. Though I must admit I was very disappointed in the ending. Leaves us hanging; perhaps leaving room for a sequel?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!this game is just like riding on a real horse. It's a real fun game LOL;) kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good for when you are bored. Not so good when trying to go to bed. It will keep you up.
1475143389|5.0|After reading Bigger, Leaner, Stronger and spending some time on Michael Matthews' blog/website, [...] I'm convinced that this guy knows his stuff.  Not only are his recommendations grounded in solid science, but most importantly THEY WORK.  I've followed his program for 3 weeks, and I've already made more progress than I did in 3 months of CrossFit.  Mike knows what it takes to get strong and fit, and once you're done reading this book, you will too.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|Enough to hold interest though still with a shadow of Fifty Shades. But quite readable and ready for next sequel.
B004EPYZTE|5.0|I'm not going to say this is an academy award worthy film, but it is visually stunning in 3D. It's one of the better examples of what a 3D tv can do. If you don't own a 3d TV, wait for it to show on cable.
B00866H7SS|4.0|It was reasonably well written. Characters have some depth. Enough to want sequel to find out what will happen next.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is a beautiful transfer to blu-ray. 1 and 2 look great and you gain a new appreciation for Coppola's talents using the full frame of the camera to capture the scene.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|This project is clearly a cynical and repetitive attempt to draw out the story with no conclusion. No interest left.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|I loved Black Gives Way to Blue.  Great album, and consistently great.  This, however, lacks some of the dynamics of that, and I don't know that the problem is: mastering, songwriting, or what.  But regardless, it doesn't reach out and grab you like the last album did.  \\"Stone,\\" \\"Hollow,\\" and \\"Phantom Limb\\" are all excellent, though, and really grab you.  The rest just seems a bit aimless.  Perhaps in time this will grow on me, but it's a step down in terms of quality for sure.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I am glad the story is going on. She left a lot open and new things open to discover in the new books.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app! I look up cute diy crafts for each holiday to decorate my room or do with my little sister. I also love tons of super hero stuff, animes, and movie stuff and always find cool fan art and hilarious quotes. I love the apps format on the fire, it works so well!! I definitely recommend this app!!! &lt;3
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to use...thought switching to an android would be hard to use kindle but it's not!  Love my kindle apps!
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|I and the family went to one of the 50th anniversary concerts (Barcelona) and it was really great. This doublé-disc álbum is truly a superb collection of the songs, done so incredibly well. But there is one snag: the quality of both discs is basically sub-standard. After only a couple of months of listening, both discs get stuck again and again in a rut on way too many songs. This is actually not the first time. The same occurred with another Beach Boys collectyion I bought from Amazon. I know this is not Amazon's fault. But perhaps its time to complain to the record company. Or am I the only person with this experience?<br /> [[ASIN:B00C7O8TSM The Beach Boys Live - The 50th Anniversary Tour]]
B00ALCBU4M|4.0|Special affects were good.  The film was interesting . With good action through out the film. Well known stars in it. I rented it and  wanted it for my collection after seeing it.  I've always been a world war two movie fan.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|This was a good read. Much of the content is similar to the author's blog so I knew what to expect. Some chapters were aligned with the Choose Yourself theme, others were a little off the wall. That is good - you could easily pick this up and read any chapter as a stand alone or they might have a bit of a disjointed feeling; choose your own adventure!<br /><br />This reminded me of a Tim Ferris or Ramit Sethi or other entrepreneur/self promoter guys but the price was right. Lots of good nuggets to take into consideration.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|great book by a renowned author who can spin a great story from beginning to end...loved it so much..yes<br />siree bob
B00A83075M|5.0|Because this was a gift to our grandson, I personally did not see it. Our son, daughter-in-law & grandson loved it!<br />They all agreed that is was a great family movie & it was fun for them to view it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I'm hooked. I play it in bed every night before I go to sleep. I try to beat my own scores and make records. It's fun.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|My son went crazy when this came in. He is a huge Dragonball Z fan, and this is one of his favorite characters. It is bigger than we thought and of excellent quality!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I am not a mother and am a bit squeamish about the topic of pregnancy, but this is such a funny, heartfelt movie. I really enjoyed it. My least favorite storyline was Cameron Diaz' because I felt her acting was very poor. My favorite storyline was Ben Falcone/Elizabeth Banks. I think they were terrific.  I think everyone has been around a woman like Brooklyn Decker's character Skylar, who seems to have such an easy life it can cause a lot of envy. I loved the dads' group. Very funny. I highly recommend it. (It was definitely a tearjerker, though).
B0053ZOQMK|2.0|This movie might need a full audience to laugh at the cutesiness...<br /><br />We found it kinda boring at our house.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I like this game a lot it's excellent to sit and play and passes a lot of time and goes up inlevels to make it more challenging
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|The story is compelling and seemed to follow reality until the end.  Why ruin a perfectly good story by making stuff up at the end for dramatic effect.  The airport scene at the end was total fabrication, the Iranian guards racing alongside the plane as it ran down the runway.... PLEASE.  If the boarder guards really wanted to stop the plane, why not call the tower and order them to refuse taxi and take off clearance?<br /><br />Other than that cheesy ending, I enjoyed the film.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|Is there anything more romantic than two strangers meeting and following in love? Not to me. I get more out of this silk every time I see it.
B009XPGJYY|5.0|This show is one of my favorite shows to watch. Has everything a show needs. Makes me want a motorcycle, love the show!!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Would of liked for the game to be a little longer, but really liked how there were a lot of hidden object scenes. Overall, happy with it.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Fun and rather quick read. I was a little hesitant to family read because of the title but it was better than the shopaholic series
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|This album is the perfect companion to Part 1 of this great concept album! I have always been amazed at Corey Taylor's voice, as well as the deep lyrics he comes up with. This band truly allows him to get out all the music in him that would not come across as well under the Slipknot banner. The entire band is first rate, how much more could I say other than buy this album & see for yourself how truly awesome it is!! Highly recommend to all!!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Her books are engaging and full of suspense.  Very dark but very believable.  Definite page-turner.  I couldn't put this one down.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|I bought this album after seeing Halestorm perform at the Revolver Golden God awards & being highly impressed with what I was hearing/seeing!! This is a very tight group, & musically it shows in their playing, as well as their songs. I will say that Arejay Hale is a beast on the drums, Lzzy is one of the best vocalists, & the entire band is impressive as hell! I know that once you hear &#34;Love Bites&#34;, &#34;I Miss the Misery&#34;, &#34;Freak Like Me&#34;, & &#34;Here's To Us&#34;, you will be Halestorm fans for life. I highly recommend the album to all true hard rock fans & I know that, just like me, you will be eagerly looking forward to their next offering!
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|One of the very best stories I have read in a long time. Even though I was constantly trying to second guess where it was going I just didn't forsee the twists and turns that this wonderful story takes. A real page turner which had me in tears by the end! A fabulous read.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|I love this album!! Scott Gorham is on top of his game, Ricky Warwick is spot on with the vocals & the backing section of Jimmy DeGrasso, Damon Johnson, & Marco Mendoza is solid as a rock!!! I believe Marco Mendoza is one of the most underrated bassists out there & paired with Jimmy DeGrasso, they bring the thunder on this one! I have to say &#34;Bound For Glory&#34; is one of my favorite tracks along with &#34;Someday Salvation&#34;, &#34;Hoodoo Voodoo&#34;, & &#34;Before the War&#34;. A very solid effort all the way around & I recommend this to anyone that loves a great, solid hard rock album.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I found the beginning of the book engaged my interest, though somewhat predictable.  I did finish the tales, by skimming pages till there was some action/development.  Mostly I was unable to suspend belief and let the tale twist and turn.  Edited to half its words, and with some of the situations made closer to real life human reactions and real people, I believe this could be a good book.  When I finally grasped the premise of the book, I thought it ingenious.  With good editing, the possible sequels could make for a gripping read.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|This album is one of Megadeth's best ever! The lyrics, the music, the delivery could only come from the man himself, Dave Mustaine!! While Metallica has fallen into the Def Leppard, years between album releases trap, Megadeth just keeps delivering the goods! The title track on this one, &#34;Super Collider&#34; is unforgettable the moment you hear it!! The chorus kept running through my head after the first time I heard it! The tracks, &#34;Burn&#34;, &#34;Built For War&#34;, Dance In The Rain&#34;, &#34;Forget To Remember&#34;, & the cover of the Thin Lizzy tune, &#34;Cold Sweat&#34; are all favorites of mine! I know the thrash purists out there are gonna ravage this album, I have to ask, &#34;You do realize Dave has been at this since the mid-80's & he can redo &#34;Peace Sells&#34; 13 times in a row, right?!&#34; This is a solid album, great production & the minute you hear the trademark Mustaine growl, you know to strap in, hang on, & enjoy the ride! Highly recommended to all fans of Megadeth & those looking for real metal!!
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|This was a fun movie to watch.  There was lots of action and humor and excellent special effects.  Language was a bit coarse in spots.
B000002J3W|4.0|This represented the beginning of the end for the Sebastian Bach fronted Skid Row, but is undoubtedly a solid hard rock album from beginning to end! The lyrical direction is different to their first two albums, but shows a growth in songwriting & overall production. I know the change in the label backed musical trends contributed to most fans never hearing this album, but that can easily be corrected by purchasing this album now for very little! I will say no more other than this is recommended to all hard rock/Skid Row fans out there & for a few dollars you can hear it for yourself!!
B004GJDQT8|3.0|have used a couple of times seems ok works well simular to website so is easy to use no no
B00BURWSHA|4.0|I liked this album, but I must admit with Doug's guitar sound, you are thinking Whitesnake & this band is not there yet. The music is very tight, blues oriented, & easy to get into, the lyrics are not quite there yet, nor is the vocalist at the top of his game yet. I must admit that I listen for vocal consistency from track to track & Keith St John is all over the place, from my point of view. I must say that Doug's solo on &#34;Pray Out Loud&#34; is my favorite & if the songwriting was a little stronger this album would jump way up in my record collection! It is a very good effort, just not as seamless as Whitesnake is & that is where your mind takes you as soon as you hear Doug's distinctive guitar tone! I would recommend me this to anyone that loves 70's style blues-rock!
B0081X8AE6|4.0|Michael Kiwanuka ia a young man whose music has the ability to reach many generations of music lovers.<br />I look forward to hearing more from him.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is the album I have been waiting for since the early 80's!! No offense to RJD, I love him in Sabbath, but the original lineup deserved to having something other than &#34;Never Say Die&#34; as their last offering! This harkens back to early Sabbath which reflected all the diverse influences of the individual members, from blues, jazz, & gypsy flamenco. I applaud Rick Rubin for getting this out of them & giving us what true Sabbath fans have been yearning for all these years! It does amaze me how everyone is on the bandwagon now & when I was a teenager, everyone questioned why I listened to them! They were my introduction to the world metal & I have proudly been a fan for all these years! I purchased the Deluxe Edition & the three bonus tracks were worth the extra dollars! Great album from one of the greatest bands ever & once you hear the tracks, &#34;God Is Dead&#34;, &#34;Loner&#34;, Live Forever&#34;, & my favorite, &#34;Damaged Soul&#34;, you will be a believer as well!! Highly recommended & remember it is #1 in the UK & US!!
081297381X|5.0|IF YOUR HEROES ARE ALAN GREENSPAN, ROBERT RUBIN, BEN BERNANKE, LARRY SUMMERS, ARTHUR LEVITT, TIM GEITHNER, HENRY PAULSON, AND POLITICIANS LIKE BILL CLINTON WHO CANCELED GLASS STEAGALL AND DEREGULATED DERIVATIVES AND GEORGE W. BUSH WHO BAILED OUT THE INVESTMENT BANKS THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU. HOWEVER, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE WHO, WHY, HOW AND WHEN OF FINANCIAL DISLOCATION IN OUR COUNTRY READ THIS BOOK. HISTORY SHOWS PRICE CONTROLS NEVER WORK AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES ARE FAR REACHING. BUT THAT HASN'T STOPPED THE FED, THE US TREASURY AND SENIOR POLITICIANS ... THEY ARE THE PILOTS WHO CRASHED THE PLANE, NOW IN 2013 AGAIN THEY PILOT THE PLANE.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|This album is proof, that even for the nostalgia about Layne Staley, the real force has always been Jerry Cantrell! The band sounds like the original version because his many contribution were overlooked due to Staley's drug addictions! This album is a solid comeback, maybe not on a par with &#34;Facelift&#34; or &#34;Dirt&#34;, but close enough for fans of their efforts! I recommend this album to all hard rock fans that miss Alice In Chains like I do!
B00BI6SSMC|3.0|I have enjoyed how Iron & Wine has evolved, expanding arrangements, themes, and range.  But on this cd, which is well done, pleasant, and very intricate in parts, the whole is less than the sum of its parts.  This is the latest cd that I keep telling myself that I need to go back and give another chance but seem to just never get to it.
B001QOGYFO|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  Action packed and intense with a ending that will keep you guessing until the end.
B00C1GBOU6|4.0|Love the new hard-edged sound.  Sigur Ros have moved forward again, staying current and while still creating new explosions of sound.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It was everything I thought it would be.  It has been instrumental in waking me up in the mornings  thabks.
B00A7L00XE|5.0|Love Ben Harper, and this is a great cd. I have been to several of his concerts and just love how he keeps growing as a musician by trying new things.
0195170776|5.0|My husband doesn't like to use internet dictionaries...like to read the book entries, so I got this for Father's Day. Was an incredible price. Listed as used in good condition, but I think it must never have been opened. It's flawless and tightly bound. Great purchase for us!
B005KWMCIQ|5.0|I had my mom get this for me and love it, and i am only 10. I am a dragon fanatic and have been struggling for months to find the right book,but somehow i found that this book was it. It gives you easy to follow step by step instructions to make elaborate dragons,and, best of all, great tips . If you get the hang of it , you can make your own.
B00181JGI2|5.0|The movie with all of its quirky characters kept me going on one of the strangest rides in quite a while, I really loved it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Never in my mind did I think I would like this series.  Twists in the plot, it absolutely keeps you guessing.  Love this era in time.  I highly recommend it.
B007REV4YI|2.0|I have been a fan of James Bond from the beginning with Dr. NO.<br />This is the worse one I have seen.  I can only hope that the next one will be a lot better.  &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; Stan.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is amazing you should get this game. It is a good way to pass time. I play it nearly all the time. This game is FREE so you should get this EPIC game
B005OK81HA|5.0|This is a great CD for Scorpions...it's well put together for any long-time fan and worth the purchase.  It's not forced and offers up some new mixes on old favs. but also some new covers by the Scorpions themselves that I had not heard before!  Would recommend!
B009EAO38C|5.0|my grandsons introduced me to the piano guys and I just love the music.  It's upbeat and enjoyable to listen to.
B004D2A04M|3.0|This is a well made product. The elastic is strong, the buckle is sturdy, and overall I don't regret this purchase.<br /><br />This product would work better for individuals that only use their light in moderate work conditions, due to the fact that with severe jarring or movement, the 360-degree rotating feature quickly becomes a way to lose a $100+ light.<br /><br />In the course of my work as a private security officer, I initially loved the snug hold of the holster with my Fenix RC10 (great buy!) but the location I work at is what some may describe as high risk or dangerous, and after a fight that almost caused the light to fall out, I have switched back to the shoddier, yet relatively secure factory holsters the RC10 comes with.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I found this book slow and boring.  I had high hopes but the format did not lend itself to an exciting read.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Fantastic album that I had not listened to (for personal reasons) for a very long time.<br /><br />I bought a copy in early May and was awed by its quality, then did some reading on amazon and purchased this remastered version. Excellent! Wonderful detailing of all the instruments, James Taylor's acoustic guitar work on \\"So Far Away\\" being only one example.<br /><br />Others have written here of the nostalgic quality of this album and yes, I know that's true, but it's far better than merely nostalgic: it's timeless. I know that Aretha and James have the \\"hit\\" versions of \\"Natural Woman\\" and \\"You've Got A Friend\\" -and I love their versions- but when Carole King is singing, there's nobody else I need to be hearing.<br /><br />My *only* caveat is the bonus tracks: the live \\"Smackwater Jack\\" really doesn't add anything, and the other song is beautifully done but doesn't fit: its vibe is totally different from \\"Tapestry.\\" It was right not to include it all those years ago.<br /><br />I burned a copy of this beautifully remastered masterpiece, sans those two bonus tracks, and have been loving it. Hugely recommended!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It took a while to catch on since I have not played these types of games in a long time but, once I remembered, I had a lot of fun!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was recommended by Goodreads.com after I read The Help.  Same genre.  I really liked this book and would recommend it.
B001EJYOBM|5.0|I'm a huge Lena Headey fan and a steelbook collector so this product screamed must buy! i spent a while trying to find the perfect seller and came across this one and the price wasjust right. I normally do not buy used products and went on a whim when buying this however, i could not be happier with the esthetic quality of the box and the disks. even the inserts were in perfect condition! thanks so much and i will definitely purchase more items from this fantastic, quick, and reliable seller :)
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Get ready to for wicked witch's screech...I mean scratchy loud scream. There is a difference. Hated the movie overall but this was just so annoying I couldn't finish watching it.
B000BISBDY|5.0|love it. i got it for one of my mothers for her bday because her son is a big fan of his. she loved it!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book was the first book I willingly read and I absolutely loved it. I can't wait to start the next one
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Riveting, disturbing, impossible to put down.  Raises all kinds of questions about our deepest fears and our capacity for self-delusion.  The twist in the end is truly shocking.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is the greatest superhero movie ever.  Joss Whedon does a great job directing. It's funny and clever. RDJ is great as usual. This is fun for the whole family.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Weather at you finger tips.  Reasonably accurate predictions.  Like the current, hourly and next 5 day forcasts.  Well worth installing if you want a weather app.
B00005N6KG|5.0|My ears get too sweaty when working out for ear buds and over-the-head ear phones for working out are hard to find.  I think these are the best: inexpensive, good enough sound quality, and they stay in place on the top of my head no matter how much I'm moving around. Love them!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|use bing as my primary search engine, but I like having google as a backup.  Well worth installing but not my favorite.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|This set has 2 robot things and escape pod thing but the reason you want it is SANDTROOPERS. Not just 1 but 2!!! And a hover bike they can ride on doing SANDTROOPER things!!!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|This security suite works very well.  Very pleased with this app.  Easy to use, straight forward and simple to use.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Finally I have found a chronicle that is as beautifully written as it is engrossing. Rivaling the fantasy world of The Lord of the Rings, this series has a pleasant mixture of strangeness and realism blended throughout. The characters are deep and well developed and the plot line is anything but predictable. Thoroughly enjoyable without being cliche, the two books that currently make up this Chronicle have earned a place on my very short list of books I'd read again. A remarkable story with a pleasant balance of calm and action, it has exceeded the expectations of this difficult to please reader!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Interesting look at \\"after death\\" and possible insight into mysteries of the universe that are beyond human comprehension.  I especially liked his descriptions of intergalactic travel and knowledge without thinking.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|One of the best games for android!! Highly recommended! Just wish it had an option to save games online so I didn't have to start over on every device.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent, I have enjoyed every episode. Of course I am in love with the English language.. so rich and exquisite pronunciation.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|I thought the movie was great... An American Classic that every one can enjoy.  I would recommend it to everyone
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|At first; I did not wanted to buy the book after all the bad reviews.<br /><br />Im very happy I did buy it! I had mixed feelings when they said the author wanted to make money and extended the book to five rather than 3. However, after finishing the book I was happy that I will get to read more about the beautiful love story and more of the incredible love between 2 people.<br /><br />Read the book, is so much better than 1 and 2. You finally get the two toguether working through theb ups and downs and still with the same lust theybshared from the first day they met.<br /><br />I loved it and cant wait to read more! The end of the book was happy and it makes u feel that the next book will be about the happy life toguether as a couple. I cant wait to read about the wedding, kids, etc.<br /><br />Thank you for giving us more about this incredible love story.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is my first book review ever, but I couldn't finish this book and not make a comment about it.  This was hilarious and endearing, and one of the best books of this genre I have read.  As much as I enjoyed the ending, I didn't want to story to end. What great characters, both primary and secondary. It was so funny hearing the story totally from the Hero's thoughts.  Emma Chase, please, PLEASE give us another book soon. You are my new favourite author.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Fun game! I'm playing this game unit Candy Crush is available on Kindle. I bought it months ago, but it still doesn't work. Hurry and fix it then I'll have two awesome games!!
1597772992|5.0|This is by far the best informational book I have ever come across.  After a family member got cancer the research started.  Meat is now a thing of the past as well as all dairy.  The documented studies on the effects of meat/dairy consumption were amazing.  The author was even a son of a rancher!  Most studies I read about seem faddish but this one was a very long term one that reached into several other countries.  The facts cannot be disputed.  With the huge cancer, diabetes and other health problems, especially here in the US,  I knew there had to be someone looking into more than a diet pill.  Dr Campbell gives statistics and studies that will have you convinced.  We have now been eating meat and dairy free for over one year.  The weight loss of 50 lbs was easy and is still off.  It is not a diet so we eat whatever we want and just exclude anything that is toxic.  So far no cancer return.  I have shared what I learned with many others and several have gone on to eat this way and are loving it.  It is hard no doubt to change but once you do, you almost feel sorry for those that have not been blessed with this life changing information.  My daughter while grocery shopping was watching a woman with small children in front of her buy her items.  Noticing that most were processed and very unhealthy she looked at the children and woman who were all very obese.  She wanted so badly to tell them to stop eating that way but obviously one has to learn that on their own.  I would highly recommend this book/cd's to anyone who wants to have a better life healthwise and feel good about what they put into their bodies.  We are all going to get old but, might as well do it as healthily as possible. Best book I have ever read in my entire life!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  A really great read. I highly recommend it and I tend to be pretty picky when it comes to recommendations.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Very happy with the product, 100% recommended.<br />I will be alert to new publications. Thank you very much for the care in packaging
0307476073|5.0|Absolutely a great read.  I remember my days of backpacking and I wish I had had the courage to take on what she did.  I dare say I would have made some of the same mistakes she did.  If you enjoy outdoors, humor, a little raw entertainment, I would say get it.  I checked it out from the library first and now I will purchase for my personal library to lend to others.  It is a book that will take you to another place as you read it and I found that place to be very enjoyable.
B0013UN9DQ|5.0|Very happy with the product, 100% recommended.<br />I will be alert to new publications. Thank you very much for the care in packaging
B0094B7GWQ|5.0|iT WAS A difficult book to read ,but unfortunately in today's society  it is to believable. I would recommend it to anyone
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is some serious fun.  My daughter and I have been playing together.  It is a great brain game.  I highly recommend it.
0374533555|5.0|Really insightful, my only criticism is he delves a lot into the minutia of research which sort of lost my interest, but he does include some solid data and case studies.  All and all one of the best books I 've read recently.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|great series; was so excited to see it on prime-took no time at all to watch the whole season. couldn't stop watching!!
0066620996|4.0|I really like this book, I also think that it's interesting that some of the &#34;great&#34; companies have fallen from grace since this book was written.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Excellent characters, great dialogue, wonderful history created, and lots of politics. Some might consider this sacrilege, but I think it is on par with Lord of the Rings.
1878424319|5.0|This is the perfect &#34;self help&#34; book, it really has solid day to day practical applications.  Often the stresses and anxieties in our lives can be attributes to us going against these four agreements.
B001CN2WXM|4.0|This movie is an entertaining film.  The period wardrobe is spot on and the storyline keeps one captivated throughout the entire film.
1400069289|2.0|Having seen that it was a best seller I thought it would be good.  It was mediocre at best, didn't take very much away from it, really did not capture my attention, a book this size usually takes me 10-14 days, this one was a chore to finish, not great.
0385535147|5.0|Characters believable and intense. Always wondering what he'll come up with to write about next. Cannot wait for the next book.
1594488843|4.0|Solid read, you can get through it in about 7-10 days, as a manager there were some great insights into motivation and inspiring others.  Not mind blowing or remarkably innovative but worth checking out.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Frustrating game am stuck on level.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched all three seasons in less than 3 weeks. I was able to watch the first two seasons on Netflix, but had to buy the third one.
B008XG1X18|4.0|It is fun to see what everyone is submitting and the fun , pretty and inspiring things that I pick to go with my personally, visional like and dislikes.
159463176X|4.0|I enjoyed this story even though it was difficult keeping track of the characters. A list of characters with a short description at the front of the book would have been helpful.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I have several Mohjong games and love them all.  Very challenging and fun game to play.I will be downloading other seasons.
B003L77GH4|5.0|If Season 1 has you hooked on TVD, Season 2 will not disappoint you! New characters, complex storylines, and a very steamy Ian Somerhalder will have you on the edge of your seat by the end of each episode!
B00503C226|4.0|I watch movies to be entertained.  This movie entertained me and I would watch it again.  I would also recommend it to my girlfriends.<br /><br />Karen - Phoenix
B004LWZW24|5.0|Extremely scary. A horror movie you don't want to miss. Almost a creepy feel to it. It seems the PG 13 horror movies are more scary than some of the R rated horror movies. And in the case of this movie that's very true.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Counting down the days...I absolutely cannot wait for the new season! I'll be speaking with a British accent for months...
B005DC68NI|5.0|A great guide for all Authors diving deep into how to market and promote your book. David does a fantastic job on relaying useful information and resources to its' readers. Great book. Highly reccommend.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|add me as a friend... queezysawa. a little slow if you don't want to pay real money, but fun none the less.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It will do just what you need it to do if its work the right way. yes it works it works
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Well, it didn't end quite how I expected it, but I felt that everything worked out the way that I wanted in the end.
B000000132|5.0|My favorite Renaissance recording and the best introduction to the band's music. There are several reissues available but by all means avoid the Collectables version.They are a reissue company that is notorious for bad sounding CDs.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I've had bingo blitz for about 5mths and originally thought it was a fantastic game.It was free and although when you run out of credits u HAVE to buy more it was still good.However in the past month it has started freezing and the power ups don't work.And for the past week the free tournament room has not been running.It can be really frustrating.So no way can give it a good rating.Get bingo beach instead!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|You guys should make more magic games for kindle I love this game just didn't like that I had to pay $10 for the full game
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have found that Vince Flynn's books so far are very exciting reading.  I love the characters and all the intrigue.
B009SGPF0W|5.0|Absolutely beautiful music! Every track! Would highly recommend this soundtrack to any Cirque Du Soleil fan!<br />5 stars for Alegria!
B00CWV8X04|1.0|Stinks!  Watch something else. Homosexual &#34;Body Heat&#34; without the body heat. Another Hollywood remake that made a dud. Waste of time and money.
B0012HEB32|4.0|I like all the actors that were chosen for the roles in this series.  Agent Ellison is excellent.  Sara Connor is great.  Cameron is a little hard to accept at first, but then you always feel a little uncertain if she is trustworthy.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is cool but it mostly blasted off of temple run. I would prefure this game to someone that didn't own temple run and couldn't buy it. This game is also cool because it is free.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Outstanding acting and drama!  A cast of true professionals in a world plagued with mediocrity.  One hates to see each episode draw to a close.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a epic fun filled game with no violence except if your playing on survival. There are no viruses this game can set off. I have had this game for 2 years and it never gets old.
B001W2I9Y4|5.0|I love this album. Mastodon can do no wrong. Oblivion starts it off right. The Last Baron is my favorite track. Stop reading and get this now
B007TK77QE|4.0|Local politics aside the &#34;Fields&#34; issues are a very current problem worldwide. I work with methadone clients and have been lucky to not have had to deal with any difficult ones but I know they are out there. The book highlights current issues with internet privacy and hacking. Could have done with some of the characters being more developed. It was almost as if there was some abridging of some of the sub-characters
B009KS4XRO|1.0|there should be no more of this hateful little app. children don't behave after playing it.this is the worst app ever.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really beautiful  graphics and good puzzles. Hints were a good level without giving too much away. I like the alchemy plot.<br />Loved it, thanks!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was a huge fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series until three books ago. I just kept hoping the series would get better. Ever since True Blood started her books have gone down. This last book was soooooooo boring. No action, no sex, no nothing. I should write a book about my life. About me going to work, go home and cooking, taking a shower,oh and shaving my legs too. Really Mrs. Harris. That's what the whole book was about, Sookie doing regular things. Readers want adventure and sex. We want a story we didn't see coming. In the begining the characters were different, exciting, and sexy as hell. Now, I don't even recognize them AT ALL!!! If your curious to read the last series, I suggest going to a public library and checking it out. That's what I did. Safe your money.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watch you will enjoy it. It about a close family and goes though as time changes. It is more then what aim telling about.<br />It's very good and keeps the viewer interested .
