B004WMKXWM|5.0|Great movie. Watched it on the kindle fire hd. I don't Really think that it had a s many details as the book, but it was great. When dobby dies, I think that is probably the saddest death of all movies.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I won't bore you with all the reasons I think the book wasn't up to Roth's other two.  Other reviewers have more than covered it.  What frustrates me the most is that with a little rework the ending could have been realistic AND satisfying.  First, I think this should have been FOUR books.  After we get outside the fence and enter the world of the future US with it's genetics war, etc. there is too much glossing over.  There is no depth to these story lines and the characters change to quickly as others have said.<br /><br />The ending could have been fixed so easily.  Yes, Tris could have taken her brothers place and gotten shot.  Great.  Realistic!  Why couldn't she have spared us the Shauna story line and just made it Tris'?  Couldn't Tris have been shot and paralyzed and that scene with the ziplining?  Couldn't FOUR have been the great guy he is - the one who obsessively goes through his fear landscapes like a masochist - take Tris on that zip line so \\"she could feel like she could fly\\" now that she's paralyzed and through the act of facing his fear of heights ) because of his great love of Tris and the freedom it gives her in her paralyzed state he is Abnegation all the way?  Tris could lose something and they could gain something at the same time?  That her sacrifice and growth forces his sacrifice and growth because, you know, something is more important than your fears?  Like love?<br /><br />And while I\\"m on a roll...it would have been WAY more realistic for FOUR's mother to meet with the Father, shoot him, and then down the memory serum...how poetic would that have been?  Eliminate the problem and then forget your guilt?  That's flawed and human.  Oh and in a perfect world...the person who would have pulled Tris out of harm's way so she didn't DIE and died himself would have been Peter.  Talk about a redemption story.<br /><br />Ok I'll stop.  Point is...we can say it's realistic that Tris died..but...it's also realistic for damaged, flawed people to liveand learn something in the process...and Tris should have lived...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game. personally I think the character outfits should be a bit easier to attain but other than that SO much fun
B00E9P959O|5.0|Much, much better. The mix and mastering job are both a significant improvement, making this version of Vapor Trails completely listenable and much more enjoyable.

0307341569|3.0|This book has a fascinating plot and background.  Libby Day's entire family was brutally murdered while she escaped out into the woods and her brother is in jail for the slaughter.  Now she lives the life of a loner still a bit haunted by her past.<br /><br />While her brother is in jail there are groups who still think the murders are a mystery and think he is innocent.  Along comes the Kill Club, whose one pet project is to try to figure out the mystery behind the murders and are certain that Libby's brother didn't do it.<br /><br />The bulk of the book, however, is really reliving the entire story living up to the time of murders and Libby's role in it.  We meet her unlikable little sisters, soon to be so much carnage across the house.  We meet her weird brother and his psych girlfriend and friend.  And then we meet Libby's poor, struggling mother.  The events that led up to the murder are fascinating in that one can see how the brother probably did it along with his friends.  Or did he?<br /><br />Libby herself starts to unravel the mystery and the book climaxes on an expected trail that put Libby herself at danger.<br />I like this novel but didn't love it, but it was entertaining enough.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|There are problems with this movie, let's be clear -- it could have been longer, there could have been more backstory, I could have cared about the protagonists more. But let's be clear -- those problems don't detract from a frightening, chilling, icky, fun, crazy time full of some of the most claustrophobic, spine-tingling, eerie sequences I've ever seen in a blockbuster. From the moment the side mirror snaps until the last time the door closes on the isolation chamber, this thing is nerve-wracking good fun.
B005CAPS0K|3.0|Movie lost a little bit to the middle end...I hope number 2 is better. Paranormal activity is better in my opinion.

B00B8R1NP0|1.0|The book was very boring and you knew what was going to happen next, also everything was pronounced no slang words how people actually talk.
006202406X|1.0|HUGE fan of the first two books. Allegiant is flat by comparison. Disliked the back and forth perspective switch from Tris to Tobias. Inner character dialogue seemed shallow, silly and unrevealing. The conflicts seemed poorly established and anti-climactic. I REALLY wanted to like this book.... Disappointment throughout. Disappointing ending. One star because I'm the type of person that sees a trilogy through to the end, even if it's horrible. I would have read it no matter what. I'm not planning to purchase or read the remaining booklets related to this series. I'm DONE.
1579655327|5.0|I have not seen another cookbook like this and I loved it.  Coffee table worthy and useful in the kitchen... I see great value in this purchase.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Decent game.  Challenging, but not to difficult.  Unfortunatly, it seems geared to make you buy in game content.  They seem to update the content on a regular basis as well.

B001BANK32|3.0|This was one of my favorite books many years ago., scarier than anything I had ever read.  But on my second reading, so many years later, it didn't live up to my memory.  I found myself skimming, and wasn't scared at all.  It was too hard to believe this time around, and the &#34;scary&#34; stuff only grabbed me as too overdone and scattered.  It seemed King just threw in as many scary things his active imagination could conjure, and it fell flat with me.  I liked the character development of the Mom and son--best parts.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|This movie should be in everyone's library. I mean that. It is funny, bizarre, and addictive. I have bought it three times.

B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|At first I was confused about the characters, their relationship, and where the events fit together.  Eventually it did come together but I thought it became contrived.  What I did like is the author's creative way of showing that all of us are thinking one thing but saying another.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|While it was almost unbearable to read at times, Veronica Roth told Tris's story the only way it should have been told.  I admire her bravery as a writer for ending the trilogy in the manner she did.  I thoroughly loved this series, and the final book was captivating and bittersweet.  I savored every minute of it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love this CD!  I felt the price was fair and I received the CD quickly. I appreciated being able to order it online instead of shopping for it in stores.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I started this series after watching the movie, I was blown away with the storytelling and the Southern backdrip. This second book was even better than the first in my opion. If you like tales of forbidden love like Twilight and the fantasy world of Harry Potter then you should check out this series, by the way, if you did see the movie, the books are soo different!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Funny movie and great for Halloween time, or any other time of the year. Have watched many time and will many more times.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|I have been eagerly awaiting this album all year and it does not disappoint. This is by far one of the top 5 if not 2 top albums of 2013, Daft Punk did pretty well also.<br /><br />If you have heard of any of AC's prior albums you know that they have never disappointed the listener. The album starts out funky with the title track Reflektor. It is cool to hear David Bowie have a respect for them as he quietly guest spots at the end of the song.<br /><br />From there the album maintains a steady pace of rock, funk and pop. You are able to also hear LCD Soundsytems's James Murphy electronic influence on the album. Favorite tracks are We Exist, Normal Person, Joan of Arc, Awful Sound (oh Eurydices) and Porno.<br /><br />Long-story short buy this album. It is too good to let pass by. I am sure the award ceremonies will be recognizing them for album of the year again.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|Recommend it whole heartedly. The prose is exquisite, yet accessible. There are passages here that are worth reading and re-reading time and time again. I will return to this book certainly some times in the future, for reference and to dwell into it deeper until some of these ideas hopefully become living habits of my life. Thank you to the author for this gift!

B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Ben Affleck elevates himself to a director of substance with Argo who can deliver a heartelt and plot-driven story without skipping the human drama. Affleck's direction makes us really emphasize will all the emotions the Americans endure throughout the movie: the boredom, the helplessness, the desire to show themselves and get it over with just to escape the tension -- all these give the main character, Mendez, a ticking clock in addition to providing natural suspense that Affleck knows how to heighten at exactly the right moments.The real key to the movie's (and Affleck's) success here is that he manages to lay out a story of surprising complexity in a simple way that anyone can follow.<br /><br />The Blu-ray brings with it the strong picture and sound clarity that are only fitting for a Best Picture winner. The package also contains special features including a Picture-in-Picture feature containing interviews from most of the major players (including Mendez, then-President Jimmy Carter and former hostages), a documentary with more interviews, and two additional documentaries covering the film’s devotion to authenticity. The Blu-ray also includes a 45-minute television special from a few years ago – Escape from Iran: The Hollywood Option. Coupled with an already fantastic film, this Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy pack is a must-own!

B004J4WNL2|5.0|Maybe I'm just saying this because I am an introvert, but this book was incredible! I felt like I was reading a book about myself. That being said, it brought up a lot of stuff I had never bothered to think about, such as how people on the other side (extroverts) think, particularly when approaching interactions with introverts! Additionally, this book has a lot of great advice on how to deal with kids growing up who &#34;appear&#34; introverted -- not the most useful info for a recent college grad, but definitely something I would want to come back to or re-read in some time when that may come in handy!<br /><br />Insightful, interesting, and a quick read! Can't recommend this book enough if you are an extreme introvert looking to add some extroversion into your life or the other way around, or if you are close with someone who is an introvert.
0743496736|5.0|I have to admit, when I read the book flap, I was leery. I thought, &#34;Oh great, a book that capitulates on the &#34;misfits end up shooting their schools&#34; stereotype. I'm so glad I read this, though. All the characters are strong in their own way. For example, I empathized with Peter Houghton, despite the fact that he killed ten people, because ever since nursery school he's been bullied relentlessly. While that is no excuse to go on a shooting spree, especially considering that not all the people he killed had been the ones who bullied him, Jodi Picoult does an excellent job on making the reader understand why he did what he did. Picoult's diagnosis for Peter of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder was a great idea, because it further explained how Peter could have shot all those people. I also felt for Josie, because she was stuck between a rock and a hard place- wanting to be Peter's friend, but also wanting to be in the popular crowd. The teen years are tough, and Peter's and Josie's characters showed this.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this product the instant Google announced that it was available. I already have an Xbox and a Playstation 3, so I'm already able to easily watch Netflix on my tv, but this product is still extremely useful!! When I'm hanging out with friends at home and a youtube video comes up in conversation, it's so easy to turn on my laptop, open up youtube, and throw it onto my tv using the Chromecast. It works just as seamlessly with my phone and my tablet!<br />The streaming through the Chrome browser is what interested me most about this product -- it's still a little laggy and sometimes the audio and video are off, but it works 75-80% of the time. I'm sure this is something that Google will improve with software updates though, and they already have in the short time since this product became available!<br /><br />Set up is pretty quick -- it did have some trouble finding the network a few times, but eventually I got it to work, and there were step by step instructions along the way. All in all, this is already a great product, with even greater potential!! Everyone out there who doesn't have a Roku or Xbox or Smart TV should definitely buy this -- especially when it comes at such a great price!
089845865X|5.0|I fell in love with this story listening to the audio.  So I just purchased a few to give for Christmas.
0375842209|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books. I liked the fact that the story is told from the view point of death. The characters are very interesting and they capture the reader's heart, each character being so different. The setting is in Nazi Germany so the reader gains insight into the lives and thoughts of the Germans and how they felt about Hitler and the Jews. The ending is kind of abrupt, leaving the reader with lots of questions.

B00006FDCD|5.0|After buying endless horror movies to keep me busy this month, one that was on my list was Stephen King's IT and man oh man is this is a classic to come from the 1990s! Tim Curry is creepy in general, so it's no surprise that he fit the role as the demonic Pennywise to a T.<br /><br />The movie revolves around a group of outcasts known as The Losers Club who band together to stop the child-murdering Pennywise. Now there's not much of a back story given on Pennywise but after checking out a back story it's said that the clown's original name was a man named Bob Gray, who became Pennywise after a demon possessed his body nearly 200 years ago. The Losers Club simply refers to him as IT. IT feeds off little kids and manipulates them into thinking it's a clown, making them feel safe and secure where he then drags them down to his sewer lair and kills them. IT also has the ability to take the form of each kid's worst fears or a deceased relative. Whether it be a werewolf, a little brother, or an abusive father.<br /><br />There are two parts to the movie. In the first half, we're mainly given flashbacks of each outcasts' childhood and how they came together. Aside from battling the evil Pennywise, they're also in a constant battle with bully Henry Bowers and his cronies. Towards the end, The Losers Club comes together in the pit of the sewer to do battle with IT, making a promise that if they don't kill it, they'll come back and destroy it. They're followed there by Henry Bowers and his posse where his friends are ultimately killed off by IT after getting trapped in his deadlights.<br /><br />Part two picks up, years later where each outcast is all grown up and leading a successful life of some kind. After hearing about IT murdering someone, they re-unite in Derry to take out IT once and for all. Along the way, IT plays several mind games with them all, warning them to leave Derry while they can or they'll all suffer similar fates: Death. It's true when they say that part2 isn't nearly as good as the first one but it's still enjoyable nonetheless. After The Losers Club reunites in Derry, IT goes to a Mental Facility to visit Henry Bowers, who confessed to murdering his friends. IT takes the form of one of Henry's friends who was killed, and convinces him to break out of the facility and kill The Losers Club. Henry agrees, is set free, and escapes to kill off The Losers Club.<br /><br />What follows is an unexpected visit from Henry Bowers at the house the Losers are staying at to do IT's dirty work followed by a final battle between The Losers and IT in his sewer cave, where they fight IT in it's true form, a huge, ugly, spider like creature.<br /><br />I must say that I enjoyed this movie a heck of a lot! I love clowns too---particularly the evil ones so it's not a surprise that I enjoyed Stephen King's IT. It was truly a great horror movie and will definitely increase a person's fear of clowns if they're not already scared of them enough. I need to read the novel as well to get more of an insight of the story. But if you don't own IT already, you need to! Buy it on here or go to your local FYE and get it for around $5.00. Either way, you won't be disappointed with this film; but then again, who's ever disappointed with a Stephen King film?

B00EUS9JF0|5.0|'NEW'  [Deluxe Edition] is a solid mix of McCartney songs and with various producers at the helm it makes for a very interesting body of work. Several cuts are quite good modern rockers, some travel back in time, while others hold onto the love ballad tradition Paul embraces so well. The vocals, lyrics, and acoustic guitar arrangements are splendid and the techno-beats are attention grabbers. I 'Appreciate' this 'New' cd as I travel down the 'Road' 'On My Way To Work' and 'I Can Bet'  'Everybody Out There' who has 'Turned Out' to listen may actually agree some of it sounds like the 'Early Days'...time now to 'Get Me Out of Here'...peace!

B00G32TD98|4.0|I was looking for a scary movie to watch on Halloween night and chose \\"The Conjuring\\". The film is based off the experiences of real life paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren. This is the type of movie that will make you start \\"google-ing\\" to the far reaches of the internet to find out about exorcisms, hauntings and demonic presences.  The true life aspects of the movie mixed with the good pacing and effective uses of suspense and old school horror tricks really make it worth watching.  It had us jumping up from the couch a couple of times.  The movie really earns the hectic and intense ending that it so carefully spent time developing earlier on with long camera shots and creaks of the door.

B00B2R5G54|5.0|To be honest, Season 6, Season 7, and Season 8 of Criminal Minds were admittedly not the best.  Now, by no means am I going to fanboy about the absence of Paget Brewster (Prentiss), but I will say that whereas her leaving was not the best choice in the world, and she will be missed, the series has redeemed itself greatly with the beginning of Season 9.  I picked Season 8 to review because I feel like this is the season people will flock to, and I specifically picked Zugzwang because it is my favorite Season 8 episode.  But let's start from the beginning.<br /><br />Criminal Minds gathers a large following, and is one of CBS' better shows, however, for every 2 fans, there are about 3 haters.  It's truly underrated, but I am glad that CBS knows it's potential.  I guess I'll look at each season so you have some sort of reference.  Please note that this is my opinion, so it is subjective.  But regardless of what I say, I still urge whoever reads to watch from Season 1, because this is still a great show.<br /><br />The first season truly was horrible.  Lucky for me, I started watching the show at the beginning of season 5, or I probably would have never watched it again.  The first season had some great episodes, but there were two problems:  Mandy Patinkin and Lola Glaudini.  Mandy Patinkin serves as a problem because Mandy Patinkin doesn't stick to anything he does.  Lola Glaudini serves as a problem because her character added nothing to the show, and is probably my least favorite character of this entire series.  The season is filled with great episodes, however I felt the character centered plots and subplots were a little disorganized.<br /><br />The biggest downfall in Season 2 is frankly that Elle didn't die from her gunshot wound and it took 6 episodes for her to leave.  However, it did redeem itself by adding in Prentiss 3 episodes later.  The strength of this season rests on the 2 part episode that has Reid kidnapped by an UnSub, tortured, drugged, and rescued.  However, it wasn't the episodes themselves that made this great, it was the effect on Reid with his drug addiction.  They didn't milk the storyline, but rather let it linger slightly in the air before resolving it.  Which is nice, and made for some really great moments.<br /><br />Season 3 is good for 2 reasons.  Gideon leaves and Mandy Patinkin leaves.  I actually liked the Gideon character, and Mandy Patinkin did a wonderful job portraying him, but as I mentioned earlier, he doesn't stick to anything.  The Season 2 plot involving Gideon's girlfriend was weak in my opinion, but at least it got Gideon off the show.  Again, I don't dislike the character, but I feel Rossi, who debuts in this season, was better and more interesting.  The worst episode in this was the 2 parter involving Garcia being shot.  I feel like it was unnecessary, as they already did this with Elle.  The season is a little rocky, but it hits its stride as it moves on.<br /><br />Season 4 begins with the aftermath of the explosion and begins the ear problem with Hotch.  To me, this was a great subplot that worked well into the season, however, I do feel it is essentially a counterpart to Reid's drug addiction. The strength of this season is it's focus on Reid's childhood in the 2 part episode (I'm sensing a pattern with the 2 parters) Memoriam, and the 2 part finale, To Hell and Back, which begins the subplot of The Reaper.<br /><br />Season 5 was where I started.  And I loved it from beginning to end.  The best part of the season was the Murder of Hotch's wife, which, like most tragedies to a main character, set the show up for a massive subplot relating to Hotch.<br /><br />Season 6 was probably the worst of them all.  For the most part, it started off pretty good, and JJ's departure didn't phase me too much, as I realized it had the potential to bring some good moments in.  Unfortunately, it didn't.  Then Prentiss \\"dies.\\"  This is why I don't much care for this season.  JJ leaves after episode 2, then at the very last episode of the season, comes back.  Prentiss is killed, and then, psych!  Faked it.  As many good episodes that this season had, there are way too many bad moments that just drag it down.  Also, the Seaver character just felt too much like an Elle clone to me.<br /><br />Season 7 was also not the best, I must say, even though it was a step up from the terror that was Season 6.  The subplot involving Reid's relationship with JJ and Prentiss was good, but not noteworthy.  Honestly, I was even more surprised that this show wasn't canceled after this season than I was when I learned it wasn't after Season 6.<br /><br />Season 8 begins after Prentiss has left the BAU.  Everyone got really upset about this, but honestly, I like the Blake character.  She makes a great addition, and combines qualities of Prentiss and Gideon, while still being solid.  This season, while not great, had a great subplot (eventually a main plot) that started right at the beginning of the season with the Replicator.  The best episode of the season was Zugzwang.  Reid has always been the most lovable character on the show and everyone wants him to be happy, and throughout the season, we are teased with him possibly having a girlfriend.  When we finally meet her, however, and are able to connect with her and love the two as a couple, she's taken away in the last scene, which was possibly one of the saddest scenes I've ever watched on a TV show.  It reminded me of why I loved the show in the first place, even with all of its flaws.  The fact that it could bring emotion by messing with your mind instead of your eyes.<br /><br />This show is not perfect, and there are many legitimate reasons to shy away, but it is an underrated gem that, if you dig a little, shines under all the dirt.  I rate it as one of my top shows and I really suggest watching it all the way from the beginning.  Plus, as soon as the 9th season is complete, if you already haven't been watching it, watch it, too, because it has been the best season of the show so far, even with only 6 episodes (as of this writing).ode 2, then at the very last episode of the season, comes back.  Prentiss is killed, and then, psych!  Faked it.  As many good episodes that this season had, there are way too many bad moments that just drag it down.  Also, the Seaver character just felt too much like an Elle clone to me.<br /><br />Season 7 was also not the best, I must say, even though it was a step up from the terror that was Season 6.  The subplot involving Reid's relationship with JJ and Prentiss was good, but not noteworthy.  Honestly, I was even more surprised that this show wasn't canceled after this season than I was when I learned it wasn't after Season 6.<br /><br />Season 8 begins after Prentiss has left the BAU.

It reminded me of why I loved the show in the first place, even with all of its flaws.  The fact that it could bring emotion by messing with your mind instead of your eyes.<br /><br />This show is not perfect, and there are many legitimate reasons to shy away, but it is an underrated gem that, if you dig a little, shines under all the dirt.  I rate it as one of my top shows and I really suggest watching it all the way from the beginning.  Plus, as soon as the 9th season is complete, if you already haven't been watching it, watchit, too, because it has been the best season of the show so far, even with only 6 episodes (as of this writing).

1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh is my favorite person to ever put words together on the internet. Now she is my favorite person to ever put words together in book format. If you like her Hyperbole and a Half blogspot, you'll enjoy reading this book. Be warn, some stories are taken directly from her blog, but there's plenty of new stuff. This book is great introduction into her art and writing style for those who aren't familiar with her blog. And for those you are familiar with her blog, you don't need a review; you already know this s***'s hilarious.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy Crush was the best game ever with one fatal flaw- it was not available on the Kindle Fire.  I was forced to play on my teeny tiny iphone screen (First World Problems, huh?).  I was thrilled when it appeared on the Kindle store.  The game is exactly the same on the Kindle as on iphones.<br /><br />I gave it four stars instead of five because it DRAINS the kindle battery.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|The in game Fighting is smooth and responsive, it moves along at a decent pace so that you don't get bored.  Only downside, if you don't spend some real money, you will have to wait between charge ups(in order to fight) and for money to upgrade.
B00G32OER4|5.0|This is the first movie to give me goosebumps for two decades.  Sure, plenty use surprise tactics, gore and dramatic music crescendos to sell the scare.  This movie had no need of those overused tropes. I highly recommend, but watch with a friend.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great book with an awesome story! Was it perfect? No, but it was a great read nonetheless. I'm now reading the rest of the series.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Just as entertaining for me as it was for my son.  Didn't have as many of the innuendos as some of the the other kid movies like Shrek or Madagascar,  but just as entertaining.
1439153663|5.0|Beautiful piece.  A novel that should be read so that we do  not forget the ugly past of slavery.  A must to read.
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|One thing I loved about this book was that the action was instant and constant.  The author has created characters that you want to care about.  You are led to feel as if they are your best friends. The world is one that I would like to visit because of its characters.  This author is a master at description. It is a talented person that can create two worlds, a normal real world for a character and an alternate world where the character(s) travel back and forth.  You would think that this would be confusing but it is not.  The author has taken an ordinary, or so we think, college student and turned him into someone who will battle evil for the good of all no matter what the cost.  This is the first book in the series and a must read, followed by the second book in the series.
1451648537|2.0|I have to read this book for book club and I am having great difficulty picking it up.  The 600+ pages look like torture to me.  I am only into 100 pages and I find SJ to be a narcissist and not a nice man.  I hope I change my mind if I continue on and finish the book.  I don't care how rich and smart you are if you have to stomp on people while you achieve your goals.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This was not at all what I was expecting. Based on the previous books I was excited to see how it would continue. The characters that were introduced before were well though out with varying dynamics....and the plot was excellent! Divergent it seems was more intent on wrapping up the triology; and it did so sloppily. #spoiler alert# Even though I would have liked the standard 'happy ending' I would be less irritated if Tris' death was more fulfilling. There were a lot of things missing for me and I am truly bummed. Can I get a refund?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I find this to be a very fun and challenging game!  You need to plan your moves and be creative with your strategy .  It is very addictive!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I heard so much about this game and it seemed like everyone was talking about it.  Tried it out and I'm hooked.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I never thought that I would enjoy this program….well, we are hooked.  It is really well done. i recommend this.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I was a bit skeptical about watching but once it got started found it quite good Jeff Bridges and ryan made a good team
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|All I really use the product for is watching Netflix, and that has been flawless so far. It does kind of limit the gadget that it must be plugged to a power source at all times. Hopefully in the future the product is expanded to have Pandora as well as other features. I am not really sure what use the device would be besides just watching Netflix and YouTube videos on the television.
B00BXZ3D6Y|4.0|The quality is good too. The file explorer function doesn't work though, I don't know if that has something to do with my device.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was so interesting and I was so surprised as to what the story was behind the HeLa cells.  It is so unbelievable to imagine how the life of this woman has helped the medical community in so many numerous ways without her knowledge or that of her families.  What she has done without her knowledge is priceless and she has no idea the effect and lives she has saved by such a debilitating and deadly illness.  Kudos to Rebecca Skloot for researching Henrietta and her family!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Must read it. It's a book deeper than it seems in every aspect, so give it a try. If you don't love it at least you will like it quite enough.
098555780X|5.0|Although a couple of them are difficult to understand even with the detailed picture instructions, I love this book, it is so easy to use and create awesome new paracord items.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is colorful, crazy, fast, Addictive, fun, & challenging! I just can't stop playing candy crush saga. Thanks King
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I could never win this game at the fair but now I am loving it. you can work strategies to get more coins and prizes! I really am hooked on this game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very cute, great graphics. Games, scheduled jobs and personalized horse if you have enough money. And you can gain 3 gems if you write a review on here if you have 20 words or more.  Galaxy S4
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is one that I use for an alarm all the time and its constantly being updated with new and better features.  Great app.

B0091WNK8M|5.0|Great, memorable characters and the quintessential teenage adventure to find oneself.  Everyone should watch this movie at least once.  Fun!!
B0088P2A7A|3.0|pictures don't open. needs fixed. please UPDATE!!!  I want to see the pictures bigger. they help tell the story of a topic.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Amazon is always the best, no doubt. I never have any problems when ordering from them. Also, Inception is a great movie!
B004FPE4DK|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone after originally downloading the album as an MP3 ( I heard one of the songs featured on Covert Affairs) and falling in love with the lyrics, music, and JVM's voice. Apparently JVM recorded this (and wrote a number of the songs) while holed up in a small house on the wild coast of Western Ireland. I'm now convinced that everyone thinking of making an album like this should go do the same. I love almost all of the songs, but especially &#34;If I Had a Boat&#34; (which was my ringtone for almost two years) and &#34;We Don't Eat.&#34; Do yourself a favor and go find some of his live versions of those songs, as well as his live cover of Steve Winwood's &#34;Higher Love.&#34; If I could pick one word to describe this CD, it would be &#34;haunting.&#34; And if you're Irish, of Irish descent, or have spent any amount of time in Ireland, you'll hear those generations of Irish musical influences and lyrical brilliance in these songs. Buy it.
007174889X|5.0|Well illustrated, organised, updated book of internal medicine. I have always loved Harrison's and this edition has kept upto it.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I could of easily given this five stars for story and epic 3D ness,but the disc never played in 7.1 just 5.1<br />After quick research it wasn't my player not being updated. I researched the fix after the fact and found it was reported by others.<br />Now I need to spend even more time researching each and every disc before buying or just not buy at all!
B000002HFU|4.0|I loved Ol Dirty on 36 chambers, but i thought his style was over my head.After the junk thats out now,I had to think about real hip hop.Wu Tang.I bought this ecpecting a! lot and I got it! Reminds me of all the Geto Boys NY style all in 1.GET IT NOW!If u love real hip hop it is a crime not to get this.RIP Dirty!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this. It is easier for me to manage than with a mouse due to injuries. It's especially good timing because my computer is acting up. Well done!
1401242855|4.0|Batman Volume 1 was easily the best writing of the series especially because it was the jumping off point to the 'NEW 52!' restart of the DCUniverse. But damn did they pull off some of the more important titles with finesse and skill. The art is spot on done by the all too well known Greg Capullo and the writing by Mr. Snyder is intriguing, and the ability to create both a &#34;corporate&#34; kind of enemy underneath the main villain(s) going by the alias of TALONS. Pretty much finger puppets to the Court of Owls, whom mask you also get with this volume. And holy smokes that mask is both menacing, comfortable, and eerie.<br />Thanks D.C. and Scott Snyder and Greg for creating a new rogue for the Batman universe side of DC. It is so rare to create such a thrilling engaging and mysterious villain that you either root against, or just can't wait to find out what the hell is going on behind it all!<br /><br />p.s. My halloween costume too. YOU KNOW IT.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Addictive series! Once I skimmed the first half of the first one, couldn't put the rest down!  Action romance & mystery-all my favorites!
B00F5BON8O|5.0|Sarah certainly mellows with age...and expands her repertoire with this album.  I enjoyed the bluegrass effect of her first two albums, but this one - a little jazz, a little country, a little bluegrass...and a lot of really great music.  One note - this is not at all like her first 2 albums - it's way better...
B00EVRHE8E|5.0|I really loved this book. It's a great coming of age novel which is easily relatable to - plus I always love reading about twins and getting under the skin of that kind of relationship, like in [[ASIN:B009Y8AOE6 LOVER IN LAW]]. I was gripped from the start and didn't want the book to end.
0670881791|5.0|First in the Chocolat fiction series set in France and revolving around Vianne Rocher.<br /><br />My Take<br />I hadn’t realized that the movie Chocolat was a Joanne Harris novel, and I was determined to read it. Then I learned that Peaches for Father Francis was third in the series. A whole series of which Chocolat was merely the beginning! Now circumstance has allowed me to start at the beginning with Chocolat. To learn how close the novel is to the film. To be able to progress on to the second in the series, The Girl with No Shadow and learn how Vianne and Anouk go from here to there.<br /><br />Now that I’ve read Chocolat, I feel a need to watch the film, and read the book again. And I’m sure I’ll want to keep alternating forever and ever, for Joanne Harris is a brilliant writer. A must-buy writer with whom you’ll never go wrong. Harris pulls you in to the scent and feel of the story. Well, yes, chocolate will do that to you! But she makes me see Pantoufle and feel Anouk’s frustrations. I can see how very merry Vianne is, how determined she is to stay for once, how much she enjoys life. She is indeed a formidable foe for one who is so unChristian as the village priest. A man for whom pride is his most overweening sin, one he does not recognize. The bigotry and judgmental attitudes of the unhappy ones.<br /><br />You can’t help but hate him and Caro, and yet Harris makes it’s easy to see how pogroms and inquisitions arose and chased out people who didn’t conform as she provides the words that help me to empathize with their viewpoint. It’s terrifying how people can interpret another’s actions so poorly and be so intent on destroying. All in the name of community! It’s lucky that the majority of the citizens of Lansquenet were on Vianne’s side.<br /><br />Thinking about the villagers, I realize how everyday their lives were. Worries about the harvest, one’s health, love for family, envy, the lack of confidence and how it affects one’s outlook and views about others. It’s the familiar, the ordinary and when the expected is challenged by Vianne’s presence...oh, look out. Her cheeriness and unexpected behavior cause others to fear for themselves, to lash out. To want to destroy. It doesn’t matter who else it might hurt, as long as the one blowing life up can go back to his or her routine.<br /><br />What is it with a priest who can condone a man beating his wife, but thinks she is so wicked because she leaves him? Why does Caroline want her mother to move into the local nursing home so badly?<br /><br />It’s both today and the past as Vianne has a foot in both. She surges forward, living life today, but her doubts and worries pull her back to her memories of her mother.<br /><br />It’s interesting that those who enjoyed people and life were the one who were happy while the others...ah, they were so very unhappy...<br /><br />The Story<br />A single mother, a witch, and her child blow into the village one day with a desire to put down roots. To open a business. One that makes people happy. A major catastrophe for the village priest as he knows that she is of the devil with her tempting wares and questioning child.<br /><br />A few see her as a challenge to their authority whether it’s within the church or in a family, and they are determined to force Vianne Rocher out.<br /><br />The Characters<br />There are hints about Vianne Rocher. That she is magic, she is a witch, she is psychic, but nothing is ever confirmed. She’s a free spirit who loves life in all its fragrances. Anouk is her six-year-old daughter. Pantoufle is her not-completely-invisible rabbit friend.<br /><br />Michel Roux is a river man who arrives on his barge, a man who used to be a builder in a past life. He and his friends—Z&eacute;zette, Blanche, and Ahmed—are unwanted by some in the village. But not Armande, the sneak!<br /><br />Jos&eacutephine Bonnet Muscat is married to Paul-Marie, the owner of the Caf&eacute; de la R&eacute;publique, who beats her.<br /><br />Father Francis Reynaud is the cur&eacute; of the parish. Proud, too proud as can be seen in his embrace of the fasting for Lent. A man with a deep, dark secret.<br /><br />Armande Voizin is an eighty-year-old woman with a love for life. Georges Clairmont is Caro’s husband. Caroline is Armande’s social-climbing daughter more interested in status than her mother. Luc is the grandson Armande is forbidden from seeing. Monsieur Cussonet is the doctor.<br /><br />Narcisse owns a nursery. Joline Drou is a schoolteacher and Caro’s friend. Jeannot Drou is the son who befriends Anouk. Guillaume Duplessis is a retired schoolmaster who loves his dog, Charly. Monsieur Poitu runs the bakery. Other children include Lucie and Claudine.<br /><br />Les Marauds is a region of narrow streets, a tiny slum near the river.<br /><br />My Cover<br />The cover is quite sedate, much like the village of Lansquenet. A subdued red background with a simple square inset of the village square bordered by a white mat and three lines as a prim bit of decoration. The title is white against a dark blue background with an old-fashioned banner effect on the ends, and it too is decorated with the same three lines, only these are in the red of the background. It’s the assorted doilies backing the title and its banner and supporting the bottom of the covert that provide the subtle flair, much like Armande’s red petticoat.<br /><br />The title is the metaphor, the theme, for it’s Chocolat that permeates the air, titillates the taste buds, and pleasures the eye, bringing us joy in our lives.publique, who beats her.<br /><br />Father Francis Reynaud is the curé of the parish.

0992251656|4.0|When a board game is made from a show you love you never know how it will turn out. I was so worried this would be a pasted on theme with just pretty pictures of the cast. All fears aside I think they nailed this one.<br /><br />Components are great. Mechanics fit the theme. I really feel like I am flying around the verse doing jobs, trying to avoid the reavers, avoiding the alliance, getting in solid with guys, upgrading my ship/crew, and making that money!<br /><br />My only complaint is the moving mechanic seemed to slow things down. If something stopped your moving, which happened often, you were stuck waiting until the next turn. We had 4 people in the game I played and it always took awhile to get back to you.<br /><br />I'm so glad I picked this one up.
B0006B2A42|4.0|Great movie!  Just as I remembered it!!  The plot still works today!  Very enjoyable viewing.  I would recommend it, great classic stars.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator is just what I wanted. Large keys, easy to use  easy to read, and it has a great look. And  the price is right.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy this is now available for my Kindle. Best part yet was that it was free. Fun game. Enjoying the challenge of each level.<br />Can't waig for the sequel.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|V for Vampire is a fairly decent game.  I have had no issue with the controls or with the game play.  I do agree with some other reviews that the lack of a pinch to zoom function can make the game difficult at times.  However, the graphics are great and the physics seem generally accurate.  It's a good time waster, to be sure.
B00CHVIPP2|3.0|My 5 year old liked this movie the first time but isn't one he repeatedly watches. Adults will be able to sit thru with a few laughs
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|So far its been quit interesting especially the flashback tie-in to the dead bodies in Season 1(2?) That was just a side note they had no wounds or anything. Great use of past material.
B00F880BWG|5.0|. . .  so you like it or you don't.  I do.  I have a season subscription and new episodes are delivered every Monday (the day after it airs) and the replay is flawless. I can watch and re-watch it whenever I want, and I don't have to sit through commercials -- can't beat that!
B00005R24G|5.0|Lots of twists which are all part of the fun, so I won't reveal them here.  But the real reason to watch this movie is to see Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier.  I'm not a huge fan of Olivier, and his acting often seemed a bit too theatrical for me.  But this movie was adapted from a play and he's brilliant and Caine is just as good,.
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|If you've seen the firs season of The Killing, itself based on the Danish series Forbrydelsen, you have a good idea what you're getting into with Broadchurch.  A child is missing, everyone is suspect and the detectives are both bright and capable but a bit damaged. Given the success of the first two iterations of this theme I imagine we'll see more versions of it, but few will be as good as Broadchurch. Well written, filmed, cast and acted.  The scenery is great, and who doesn't love David Tennant?  The lead character is deathly ill, but somehow I imagine he'll live just long enough to film a second series.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I like that King went on to tell what happened to Danny. Stephen King mentions in there to go into this book knowing the book version of the Torrences rather than their movie characters. I agree with him, as I was reading it I was visualizing the movie. I have read the book but it was a long time ago.
0547884591|5.0|Mr. Ferris is a modern day renaissance man and inspiration within reach. He masterfully has spread his knowledge in his own personal way, giving us the chance to improve ourselves and our lives one more time with this book. Well written and illustrated, very easy to follow. Thumbs up!
1857885082|3.0|I bought this book as required reading for my Fulbright Scholarship before going to spend a month in the UK. I would say that while I found it interesting reading before I left, many of the mannerisms she describes did not seem to hold particularly true. Much of the book is rather exaggerated, which left me somewhat over prepared. While that certainly isn't all bad I found myself somewhat unnecessarily nervous for the first couple weeks before I realized how seriously I ought to take what was discussed.<br /><br />This is a fun read for sure, but it would be a good idea to not rely singularly on this if you are also heading to the UK for the first time.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, I did see this all over book stores in the UK. It appeared to be considered an interesting and entertaining read there, which may lend some helpful insight prior to reading the book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|When I heard John was writing this book, I re-read A Time to Kill. This book did not disappoint! Classic Grisham, lots of twists and turns. Could not put it down.
0307352153|4.0|This book bears a strong likeness to Malcolm Gladwell's popular novels, in that she does a good job of making various social science studies accessible and interesting through creating an interesting narrative and then backing it up with the science. That being said, I found that it also extends its Gladwellesque terms in that often times the way it interprets thing could be read a bit more critically; one of my main criticisms with the book.<br /><br />I did really enjoy reading this, and was great in that I went in knowing very little about the introvert/extrovert ideals and came out feeling much more knowledgeable and I very much found it an entertaining read!
B004SBULWE|1.0|If it had zero stars, I would give it that.  It wouldnt do anything, like it had no options.  This was completely useless!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game!!  Addicting!  Can't stop playing.  Enjoy the different levels and the challenges they bring.  Keep the levels coming...woo hoot
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|I loved this tour live. the best part is that nothings left out. I'm actually going to purchase a few more.

B005H9B44A|5.0|I saw Marvel's The Avengers and I had to go back to see Thor's story. I loved the movie and cannot wait to see Thor: The Dark World.
B00FW5PI0U|5.0|While this is a very Christmasy album, it is still decidedly Bad Religion and if you love Bad Religion, this album delivers!
044024630X|5.0|The Affair by Lee Child<br /><br />Parts of Reacher's past are explained in this book.  I recommend it as a first read as opposed to the order in which they were published.  As usual, when Reacher’s sense of justice is violated, mayhem ensues.<br /><br />Reacher finds himself embroiled in political intrigue and a possible well connected serial killer.  Once again there is a startlingly beautiful woman involved.  Although he prides himself on being a loaner, Reacher's impact on others provides him with loyal allies.<br /><br />The murder of an innocent provides he impetus for Reacher's unique style of Old Testament retribution/justice.<br /><br />As in all the Jack Reacher books I have read so far, there is non-stop action and lots of violence.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and I recommend the book.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Thsi isnt for the faint of heart. Saw it a month ago and it still haunts me, so I had to buy a copy for myself. Let the nightmares begin.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Compared to Gladwell's previous works, this book has very few \\"Wow that's amazing\\" moments. Very little useful information. Read his other books instead.
B00EHMG358|2.0|I didn't particularly care for this preview and chose not to buy the full version.  It really did not grab my interest at all
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have not finished the book yet, but I can tell that the author has captured situations, feelings, that one can associate with.<br /> Well written, the language, the style captivating.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|An extremely entertaining and thought-provoking take on post-apocalyptic survival.  Suffers from tempo problems at times, but overall a great read.  Recommended for anyone who has ever spent time day dreaming about the perfect fallout shelter.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|One of the best cd's i've heard in awhile. I can actually sit and listen to the entire thing and not get tired of it.
B00CRJSWBQ|5.0|I haven't built a pc since 2003, with periodic upgrades, needed a new one, and chose to build just to learn the new technology.  I selected this board due to all the advertised features, but especially the on board 801.11ac wireless adapter.  I recently upgraded my wireless router to Netgear R6300 11ac and wanted the capability in the pc.  Prior to purchase, I called Asus a few times for information and they were very helpful.  After the build, the unit would not POST; I checked and rechecked and could find nothing wrong.  I called ASUS  about 9:00 PM expecting to get voice mail, but got a live technician; they're on duty 24/7.  That is outstanding to have assistance when needed.  After a few tests, it was just my luck that the board proved to be faulty and they recommended that I contact Amazon.  I did, and Amazon, shipped me a replacement overnight at no charge.  Wow!  Now that's service both from the manufacturer and the distributor.  With the replacement, the unit POSTed and works flawlessly.  I'm really impressed with the MoBo.
1455576387|5.0|After reading this book I understand better how King & Maxwell's relationship began.  Looking forward to reading subsequent novels.  Love David Baldacci!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I bought the game when they had it for free and I really enjoy playing it --even more than I thought I would. I definitely recommend this!
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Story and actors were great. If only Tarantino would be less &#34;Tarantino&#34; with the overdone graphic violence. Less is truley more in this case.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My 4 year old absolutely adores this game.  It's clever in it's simplicity, but allows he to play around with cut, style, and coloring of hair without an actual head.  The controls are simple and intuitive and the app runs smoothly on my first generation Kindle.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Awesome movie! And I love pepper being a badass, she mad that hole last scene. YEAH! I love it, big time.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun times for all if you are willing to work for it. Just don't let it suck your life away.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest. The app is great. I rarely have any issues with it. The newest update is awesome. You can pin so much easier and faster.
B004LWZW24|4.0|I actually saw Insidious 2 prior to seeing the first Insidious.  It ties in perfectly!  I would recommend this movie to my friends and family.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Never seen the previews or the trailer. I heard from a friend that it was good. One day I was just looking through Amazon's Prime movies and decided to rent it to see what it was all about. Great movie.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I've decided to give Allegiant 3.5 stars, but can't give more than that. I just read on Veronica's website the reason why she decided to do what she did, but I don't agree with her choice to do that at the end of this story, and I am disappointed that she felt she had to. Now to what I liked and did not like about Allegiant, the 3rd and final book about Tris, Four and the Factions that began with a bang in Divergent. I absolutely loved Divergent. It was so different, unique and mysterious. Insurgent, the 2nd in the trilogy was good too, building up to what the factions are all about, and what is really outside of Chicago's walls.<br /><br />Allegiant started out rather slowly. After learning about the &#34;Allegiant&#34;, who they are and what they stand for; Tris, Tobias, Christina, and even Caleb (and others) get to leave the city, and the group learns what the factions are all about. Once they are installed and living (temporarily?) in the Bureau building, while learning about their actual reality (and I'm not going to go into detail so as not to spoil anyone), what being &#34;Divergent&#34; actually means, the story takes a drag. It seemed like Roth was continuously beating us over our heads with the correlation between the difference in the Divergent (genetically pure or GP) and the GD (genetically damaged) and how that compares to our own society between the &#34;haves&#34; and &#34;have nots&#34;. I get it, I get it,, I don't need 100+ pages explaining that to me over and over again.<br /><br />Roth also tells this book from alternating POV's between Tris and Tobias. However, their voices were too close to each other, it was sometimes difficult to remember who was speaking and I'd have to go back to the beginning of the chapter sometimes to figure out who's head I was in. She should have just reserved her alternate POV's for the very end - I think she would have had even stronger shock value then anyway.<br /><br />However, once we get past Roth's ramblings about the fact that the GP are superior than the GD and that we need to start some type of revolution, yeah, once that was done, the story picked up and got very exciting. I was on the edge of my seat.. what will Tris do? What will Tobias do? Will they make decisions that affect each other? Will they stay together? What plan of action will they all decide to take?<br /><br />Tris is known for rushing into things, not thinking them through completely and putting herself in tough positions (like almost getting killed several times). I think she really starts to think about who she is and what she wants out of life, once she realizes where she (and her mother) actually come from and why she makes the choices that she makes. Tobias, on the other hand makes some really stupid decisions that keep him out of Tris's favor for a good part of the middle section, and Tobias does have some beautiful lines though.<br /><br />&#34;Her eyes drift to mine, and her stare carves me into a smaller man.&#34; -Tobias<br /><br />&#34;Sometimes I still forget to look for the gentler parts of her. For so long all I saw was the strength, standing out like the wiry muscles in her arms or the black ink marking her collarbone with flight.&#34; -Tobias<br /><br />And while these moments were at times beautiful and other heartwrenching particularly between Tris and Tobias, nothing could have prepared me for the ending. Again, as I stated earlier, I am disappointed in Ms. Roth, and think she should have made a different (and I feel better) decision. Were it not for that beautifully written Epilogue (and again, I can't go into any detail without spoiling it), I think I would have questioned my reading this book and whether or not reading the entire series was worth it! I still sometimes think about that.bout the fact that the GP are superior than the GD and that we need to start some type of revolution, yeah, once that was done, the story picked up and got very exciting.

B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It's nice to see a challenging game that is also fun that doesn't involve screaming birds launched from a slingshot!!
0723257639|5.0|Read and re-read it for yourself and your family. The artwork is wonderful and a total keeper for your book collection.
1476729085|2.0|Doesn't really live up to the hype. I have to admit that, maybe my expectations were too high. When I first read the book description, I thought of Big Bang theory and expected that this would be uproariously funny - wasn't really. There are definitely amusing moments but for the most part the humor just wasn't there, what should have been funny was more awkward than anything else and in a few places it was just irritating. The characters are a bit hard to sympathize with which made it hard for me to really involve myself in the story. It isn't a total loss, overall I would say this story is unoriginal with a lot of clunky moments, but overall, cute.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I grew up watching this and although Mrs Trunchbull is ridiculously horrible, just take this story like any other comedy - with a pinch of salt.<br />The story line is simple and pleasant - the special girl finds her true family.<br />I know I'll enjoy this in years to come.
B003PIUBZS|1.0|Do you know what it's like being sprayed by a skunk and the smell that remains thereafter? That is what this series is like. It stinks and it just keeps stinking episode after worthless episode.<br /><br />I found it hard to like any of the characters in this series. The main character is a savage. Too many of the characters have evil intentions seeking either fame, glory or coin.<br /><br />The series offers little to no chance of the viewer engaging in intellectual thought.<br /><br />I thought the plot was rather boring. I really didn't care what happened next as everything seemed randomly put together. Too much sex. No real man wants to see male parts either.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't waste a second of your time on this series. It's not worth it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Once it got going, (quickly), it did not stop.  Every input was pertinent, no wasted, draggy chapters.  Hard to put down to even get daily chores done. Keeps you guessing how it all will work out.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|It was a bit slow, but good all the same. I can't wait to read the next one! So excited.
B0002KQNUO|5.0|One of the best Cirque de Soleil cd's, especially because of Francesca Gagnon (angel voice).<br />Marvellous variation of sweet lyrics and dynamic pushing rythms.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Overall I like this game. Pretty good graphics, however as an equestrian the trot looks extremely unnatural and is actually a bit disturbing. I would also hope to see more English saddles on the game considering its mostly English shows. Basically fun game, maybe not the most accurate but definitely the best tablet/phone horse game I've ever played.
B005ES0Y0Y|5.0|I wanted to find some crocs that had a very thick sole because I walk on large gravel a lot.  these are perfect.  They are very comfortable, yet stay on my feet with the back strap in place.  They are just a little snug on my big toe, but in order for them to fit perfectly I would need a 1/2 size and they don't come in half sizes.  I think that if I would have gone a size up they would have been a little too big and my feet would have slipped out.  I will buy another pair when these wear out.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|interesting design. Weigh a little. Size small - for men with big hand is very small, you can wear a woman.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I absolutely loved the book. I am excited to see how the movie adaption stacks up. Going this weekend to check it out!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I love this entire story!  It moves right along and keeps you interested! This dvd was an awesome buy and makes a great addition to anyone's movie library.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is tons of fun. I got the app for free and glad I did because it is also very addictive.<br />It truly is a TON of fun.
159413586X|5.0|This is an awesome book. Suzanne Collins is a wonderfully descriptive writer. I could not put this book down! This is the 3rd book of the Hungergames, These books are by far some of the best writing I have read in a long time. I recommend this series of books to anyone that loves to use their imagination and make their own movie in their head while reading.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|All I can really say about this book is \\"perfect\\". It was so moving, wonderfully written, and pulled at my heart from beginning to end. I haven't read a book this good in a very long time. Would certainly recommend to anyone.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Genius. Seriously. Genius. I cannot listen to this tremendously satisfying project without getting choked up at the final song. I only hope they do it justice on the stage.
B00G2SIW7M|3.0|Too much like dance music.  I prefer their previous album, The Suburbs, which is a real classic album.  Good, but not near Arcade Fire's best!
B004CS7R70|1.0|I read many reviews of this product before purchasing it and thought I was buying something I could use for concerts, like wearable binoculars.  This product is designed for people with glaucoma and other serious eye conditions, to enable them to watch TV from 10 feet away.  It is useless for the purpose I purchased it for and a complete waste of a lot of money.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|good for running and working out.  Put this on and head out for a run and you will have added energy.
B007HUD6OS|3.0|Easy paced script , not too many twists , kids with lots of good win but not a gripping legal drama that one expects from Grisham.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I have not seen the play but truly enjoyed the CD.  It was a wonderful experience for the whole family.  Ben Nottingham
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Really like it a-lot, just difficultly at times with any kind of precise movement needed since touch screens/ tablets aren't so precise!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Story transition from shining was smooth and kept me captivated.  Lots of moral lessons impeded into story lines.  It was scary...very suspenseful.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Very enjoyable film.  Good character development, interesting plot, amazing graphics.  Wife found it a little intense.  I look forward to the next Tintin adventure.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great way to unwind after a stressful day. It is quick responcive. I love it!  Have fun!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|A simple, easy to use calculator.  I have used it quite often in the two days since I ordered it.  Can not think of a way to improve without complicating it.
B000068CNX|3.0|I've enjoyed this series, botjh when it was on television, and the reruns on the disks. It still came across though, as visiting the past. This was thoroughly captivating, but it's now past.<br />My thanks to the seller
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So far I have only tried youtube and netflix on this guy but it works great. If you have a good internet connection the quality is really good after a moment of the video loading up. I have been sending video to my tv from my smartphone and it works pretty seamlessly!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Goes right to ebay and what you want on your device. This is a most have especially for the upcoming holidays.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game is so scary, I love it. At first I thought it ain't that scary then I played it and wow I was scared crazy... it made me jump the second time I played. I only rated it four stars only because the first time I played I ended up falling through the ground and floating in the air. I believe it's a glitch, but it's not that big a deal. To escape that situation I just hit my home button and started over.
B008LFY6NI|3.0|I am not too crazy about this; the novelty wears off fast. It does have in - app purchases which might make it more enjoying but I don't like in - app purchases.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fascinating to see life in the aristocracy. A must see after season one. Can't wait till I can start the next season.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I love these songs and the comradery that I feel in listening to all of the players around the world. It is the feeling of HOPE!
B00C7607BC|5.0|My grand daughters (ages 4 and 2) loved it.  They have watched it six times since we got it.  They love Ariel.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I've been waiting for this to be releases since Retrospective 3 came out with the two remixed songs. This remix finally does the album justice, although I still enjoy listening to the original since it marks the first album of Rush learning to become Rush again,
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|I played it for 3 hours the first day I had the game.  Its basically a mobile version of The Kerbal Space Program.  Definitely worth the $2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|All of my grandchildren love this game, even my two year old grandson can play it on his own. Helps them with hand eye coordination.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|I have always loved this movie!!! And the actors in this movie makes it better!!!!  Customer service was great which is always a plus!!!! :)
B004XUMMFE|4.0|It is too bad they did not make a second season, it would have been great. We would highly recommend this series to others.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I absolutely love all of the Jack Reacher series.  Jim Cavesal should play the character in movies if they make some.  I will not go see the movie that Tom Cruise did because he does not fit the character.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Excellent acting, good script and believability.  I love the instant Amazon feature that I use to watch the series on my IPAD prior to retiring for the evening.  I highly recommend the series and look forward to watching more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best puzzle game after tetris and be jeweled.  Just love playing it. The game is really additives. Recommended for everyone
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Awesome 3D I love this movie and  recommended this movie and the second part with the Rock I hope you guys liked
0739366408|5.0|WATCHED THE MOVIE BUT THE BOOK IS SO MUCH BETTER. I THINK ALL BOOKS ARE BETTER THAN THE MOVIES ARE.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham continues to outdo himself with skillful mastery of the twists of life in his cleverly drafted stories! I love how he brings to life the pain agony and rebound of people who are endeavoring to make it in life!<br /><br />Once again a great read!<br /><br />Hard to put down each and every creation!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works perfectly and can be seen w/o glasses in the dark Kids and friends really love it. Great App !
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I've had this alarm clock on my last 2 phones. I love that it's customizable. A different playlist to wake to for work, another for my daughter's class. My alarm. My music!
B000244FDW|4.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice follows the storyline of the book quite well. The main actors are quite good, except that Mr. Darcy seems overly sour at first. This Jane's appearance more closely resembles a beauty than the Jane in the Colin Firth P & P. Overall quite good, but my favorite is still the Keira Knightley, Matthew MacFadyen version, although it is not quite as true to the book as the Colin Firth version. Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennett are much more tolerable in the Knightley and MacFadyen version than this or the Collin Firth version, IMHO. We will still watch this again sometimes.
B00DOPEGAS|1.0|I bought this for my 8 year old's birthday and she is in tears because the instructions are dreadful and do not match up with the pictures.  The rubberbands will not stay on the pegs.  I am going to our local store and buying the cheap version because that is what all her friends have and it WORKS!  I am hoping I can get my money back for this one!
B004SIP7AS|4.0|Though this version cuts out some of the material of the book to make a shorter length movie, it is still quite good. Gwyneth Paltrow is a quite credible Emma. Of the shorter Emma versions, we still prefer the the Kate Beckinsale version overall. The longer BBC Miniseries is also very good and mirrors the book quite well. In this version the casting of Harriet Smith seems too old and not pretty enough to see how Emma could think that Mr. Elton would prefer her. However, Mrs. Elton is quite a lot more charming in this movie than the one in the Kate Beckinsale version. Overall, liked it and will watch it again.
B000WTNCQI|5.0|Really excellent edition double album,well packaged and obviously a gem from U2,must have vinyl I strongly recommend it ,five stars
B008EKOO46|5.0|I'm a fan if Jared Diamond. This is a very good book and eye opening on the history of mankind.
B00004THAY|5.0|If you're a blues fan, this is a must have CD.  Great combo of two of the best blues artists ever, worth the money !!!
B0031SU2Y2|5.0|several years after that movie came out, the problem is still the same and even worse in Calais ( north of France)
B005MMY9A8|2.0|Movie jumped around too much and the storyline was lame.  Also the movie appeared to be darker than normal.  Half of the time we couldn't even see what was going on.  This movie shouldn't have been made in our opinions.
B009ZQNN90|5.0|Wonderful true story that is truly entertaining throughout! After watching the movie, see the new Broadway Musical for a really sparkling take on the story.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Third is a fun and challenging game,where you must figure out the proper angles to make it through each level.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I loved this series when it was on TV. I love watching the superb acting and character development once again. The discs are in good condition and this is a nice escape from reality.
1616551631|5.0|I am an avid collector of art books and had often gone past this one as I looked through Amazon's selection. Of course I didn't buy it on the spot as I had not actually played the game.<br /><br />But once I checked it out I immediately noticed that the gameplay was nothing to write home about, the designs on the other hand vibrant, moving and really impressive.<br /><br />So once the artbook arrived at my house, I immediately flipped to the area design section of the book and all of it was intricate and incredibly inspired. Although they briefly go into the character design stages I felt those were rather under whelming.<br /><br />The enemy designed however were very cool to see.<br /><br />I recommend this as a strong buy.
B0042816YK|5.0|If you are an uncurable romantic you will like this movie. It is a &#34;thought&#34;  travel through a mid-life crisis.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Batman comes to life in An amazing trilogy, bonus discs,collecters booklet packed into one sweet collection. 5*'S all the way.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I loved this movie. The discs were in good shape and when I need a break I can always depend on these actors to lift my spirits.
B00915G6R6|4.0|We love the Good Wife series.  Have watched from the start.  But my husband doesn't like to watch it each week,  we wait until its over and then purchase that year series.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|This movie lifts my spirits . The discs were in good shape and I have enjoyed watching the &#34;Good Morn'in segment&#34;. Wish I could dance and sing that way in the morning/without any sleep.
B005LY4B0A|1.0|boring...frustrating that there seems to be no way to get three stars past third level. uninstalled in under 15 minutes. waste of time.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Full of data that you hardly encounter when you read about food. Very interesting and if you let it... is a catalyst for your conscience
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Wish you could view your trophy's and would like to see a practice range. Some archery equipment would be nice too!
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|IT WORKED WHEN NONE OF THE OTHERS DID!!  I am so happy about this!!!  Now I can see my grandson learning to walk.  Thank you!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Item was on time. Item quality is amazing and cheaper then Game stop. Strongly recommend this remote.<br />Really a 5 out of 5 quality remote
B0036TGT2A|5.0|I have watched with grand babies like I did with my kids. It came even with the 3d.  I do not have a 3d player but the blu-ray is awesome.  Gonna give digital copy to my son for the grand babies.
0670024856|5.0|This is such an incredible book from the deckle edge pages to the beautiful plant bookplates but most of all, the gorgeous writing and the incredible story.  I have such book hangover after reading this that I haven't been able to start another book.  Be sure and look at Elizabeth Gilbert's website (video) because she takes a tour of the house that helped inspire this story.
B00755MHXG|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a young mother who had not personally dealt with facial disfigurement, but her daughter was reading this in school. Then I heard about it from two other people, who also did not have personal experiences to relate to the subject matter, but loved the book. Everyone said it was popular, and I was surprised, because of the difficult topic. I have made facial prosthetics for children and adults with facial differences, and always thought part of the problem these people had in trying to face the world, was that they were the 'only one' in their community. I think people are uncomfortable or afraid of what they have never seen before and don't understand. This book helps to explain and eradicate fear of the unknown, thus creating a more accepting world for people with facial differences.<br /><br />I think this book is particularly good for children, but also adults, because each chapter is told from a different point of view. It challenges stigma from multiple points of view, which I think is fantastic. So it doesn't ask the reader to only identify with the child August, who has the unique face, but it asks the reader to identify with different members of the family, classmates, friends, who address the elephant in the room in their own unique ways. Each viewpoint also gives the reader different avenues for compassion to reach us. For one character, we see compassion through being an outsider because of low economic status. For another, we see compassion through feeling ignored or unwanted in one's own family. It makes it easier to find a way to connect to our own inner place that has hurt before, and doesn't want to see a fellow human being hurt as well.<br /><br />I also think more successes of the August character are use of humor, idiosyncrasies, and that he also doesn't tell a tale of 'overcoming odds' or being an inspiration to everyone like many disability stories do. He doesn't win a contest or climb a mountain, he just liveshis life and goes to school. That makes him easier to relate to. I think the author is brilliant for including an award at the end, for our able-bodied tendency to make disabled people our emblem for deeper meaning. August wasn't expecting it but knew that's the sort of thing others project onto him.<br /><br />I feel almost guilty having a critique, but something was missing for me in this book: August's ugliness was not adequately challenged as a concept. He has a beautiful personality, but his physical form was not 'beautiful'. There is no alternative explanation for his face, other than how bad or ugly it is, but we are all directed to 'stop noticing' the ugliness 'once you get to know him.' There is more than one kind of beauty in the world. In my profession, we often point our patients to Roman marble statues, often missing a nose, chin, or an arm, but revered as invaluable things of beauty. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I don't think even August's parents relay to him his beauty. They love him dearly and don't want him to hide his face, but I think they should have been explicit and used some positive words to challenge the variations of 'ugly' throughout the book. I think the father calls August 'spiffy' when he gets his graduation haircut. That's about it. If this book gets optioned as a movie, I hope a few more words make it in the script!<br /><br />There is more I could say, having lived and worked closely with this topic for several years now. I just appreciate this book so much, and am thrilled that it has been widely read in recent popular culture. It definitely is a trail blazer for more similar material, very welcome indeed.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am not sure what I expected when I preordered this book....well I do know what I expected........ I expected a collection of  story or stories that would provide some additional closure. What I got was short blurbs (in some cases a sentence or two) mostly about characters who I couldn't even remember. It was like they published Charlaine's notebook. Don't waste your time or your money. For whatever reason Harris' imagination abandon poor Sookie long before the last book.

B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Saw all the good reviews and decided to give it a try.  So glad I did, because it really makes you think.  Gives me a sense of accomplishment when I figure it out.  It's addictive. :-) Playing on a KF.
B00DB2JQ7W|4.0|When I heard World Boss debut at Mountain Jam 8 last year, I loved it.  When Warren spoke of the new album at Lockn', I knew I had to get it.  And after listening to the first CD last night, I love it even more than when I heard four of the new songs at that festival.  I was all geared up this morning to hear the second CD this morning.  I'm a sucker for GOOD interpretations of original music by other artists (the Deadicated album comes to mind).  I really wanted to hear what each of these guest artists was going to bring to the table.<br /><br />Unfortunately, just their voices, singing along with the exact same mix as the first CD.  Since the whole album is under the Gov't Mule name, I guess I understand the need, artistic and legal, to keep them as the band for CD 2.  But not one discernible difference in style or tone between the two discs.<br /><br />There is one silver lining, I suppose, to having the guest vocalists singing to the original mix, and that's as Mule's homage to each of them.  Funny Little Tragedy seems not written for, but by Elvis Costello when he lends his voice to it.  The dirty funk of Stoop So Low is a perfect match for Dr. John's grisgris.  In that sense, the second CD turns what could have been a predictable tribute CD to Gov't Mule - often the first sign of a star on a downward arc - into Gov't Mule paying tribute to the artists who've influenced them.<br /><br />So on balance I'd have to say this wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but I'd much rather see Mule as journeymen still plying their trade, still getting up on stage every night with something to prove and doing it, than as elder statesmen sitting back and accepting polite accolades from artists generating the electricity they lost some time back.  This album shows Mule is still a dynamo to be reckoned with, lighting up each town they roll into as only they know how.<br /><br />Right now I'm listening to Grace Potter singing Whisper in Your Soul, experiencing the same shivers as when she was singing with Mule at Lockn'.  Those who were there know what I'm talking about. :-)
B003719GGS|5.0|I was struggling with things in life and kind of fell away from my wife. I decided to read this and WOW! It made a big change. I have recommended it to friends who are struggling because a stronger marriage makes other struggles seem so much less.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Watched with my folks when I was little. Wanted to  rewatch to remember. Love it. It's really great writing. Satisfies the downton abbey fan while waiting for their next season.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I loved this book! I have read a lot of books on Lincoln and on history in general, but this was magnificent. It helped me to have a much deeper appreciation and regard for Lincoln. He was a truly amazing man- humble and unassuming, yet very astute and wise. If more politicians were like Lincoln, we would be fortunate indeed. He was a good listener and considered the viewpoints of all his cabinet members, but once he took a position, he stood by it. This was a long book, but enjoyable to read. I did not want it to end.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was a most compelling story. Well written and a good prospective into human nature. Also a good prospective on how horrific the Jews were treated by Hitler. Good read.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Love love love.  Easy to see big numbers.  Easy to use. Great calculator for Kindle Fire.  Highly recommend.  Thanks Kindle Fire.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great sequel which outshines the original.  Deep characters, great plot and crazy good action.  Funny, serious and just plain awesome.  JJ Abrams does it again.  Digital Copy on my phone/tablet.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|This is the modern revitalization of the &#34;space opera&#34; - none of the cheesiness of Stargate SG1 or Atlantis, modern special effects, few plot contradictions, incredible character development and a compelling story.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My son has loved this show since he was 4, now at 7 he still likes it and I can even enjoy watching it with him.
0062225790|5.0|This is definitely the book that you want to purchase. Well structured, well written, great depth and facts. I highly recommend this.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|nice to read a classic study novel and still feel refreshed. great story and interesting philosophy.<br /><br />surprising twist in the plot as well. didn't see it coming.
B00BMEF97W|4.0|the album is with out a doubt great the only thing i have to say is that the vinyl seemed very cheaply made. i have a lot of vinyls and compared to the others this one isn't the best quality but it works and like i said..the album is great
0316286850|3.0|Wish there was more instruction for a semi novice on how to apply makeup and get a certain look.  I think I ordered the wrong book.
1476729085|4.0|It is a relief to be reading a book that is natural in its talents in portraying what autistic thinking is like.  Very endearing.
B009CPGZFS|5.0|The Mentalist is a great detective program. Patrick Jane comes off as a somewhat cocky libertarian working with try-to-be-by-the-book team of CBI (CA Bureau of Investigation). A good mix for entertaining viewing.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|It keeps my interest and has excellent actors and actresses but I don't like the breaks when the narrative cuts to the next scene, the cuts are long in duration and thus disruptive
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really connected to the characters and could visualize the scenery and their actions. My new favorite author!! Fast read.
B000ICZD4I|4.0|Highly entertaining movie that personally I wouldn't have chosen. My girlfriend said it was great when she watched it years ago, so we gave it a whirl. I really enjoyed it, especially seeing some very young versions of some of today's stars. Kathy Bates was awesome as ever, and the movie flew along. I recommend to anyone for a good Tuesday night movie on the couch.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Breaks your heart but it's one of the best literary journeys I have ever taken. Complex, beautiful, deep and sad. I couldn't leave it.
B0054JELS4|5.0|Great series to watch.... Enjoyed watchin every one of them!....would recommend persons to buy as a gift for a special person!
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|It's important to know that Lightroom is as much about managing your pictures as it is about developing them.  It's kind of like going through old shoeboxes of prints and negatives.  Some people label everything and others just stuff the boxes and spend hours trying to find that one pic that they're desperately looking for.  Of course the program is so good at editing pics, that going over to photoshop is only required for extreme things these days.<br /><br />Anyways, Kelby's book is a fantastic starting guide, so good that I am in the process of re-importing all of my pictures taken over the past several years.  I wouldn't say that I'm a complete random shoebox guy, but my folder labels don't do my pics justice.  The first several chapters deal solely with importing and getting things set up to make your life easier, and it's mentioned that this is the way Mr. Kelby does it, hence the good opinion line.  These chapters will amaze those thinking &#34;why does everyone always say that LR is such a great program?&#34; as they plod through attempting to learn on their own.  It's all about workflow.<br /><br />Then it hops into chapters about developing pics, printing, etc.  Developing in LR is pretty easy once you start to learn shortcuts and exactly what all those little sliders do.  There are downloadable examples that you can use to practice right with the book.  Everything is laid out in a way that no knowledge of the program is assumed, so anyone can work right through something.<br /><br />Now I did download the kindle edition for my iPad.  I'm on the fence as to whether I really like instruction books in the e-format.  With a book like this, you'll be looking to flip back and forth a good bit, so you have to make good use of bookmarks.  I may have preferred a printed copy for that reason, but it's not that bad to deal with.  What I should really be doing is taking notes.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I love her style of writing! The story makes you think of how life can change in a momement and all the what if's along the way. Excellent read!!
B00EP0SIOG|4.0|There is no getting around the fact that this is a remote control vehicle shaped like a sphere that is controlled via an app, over a Bluetooth connection.<br /><br />The changing colors, the zippier interface, and the faster movement with cool macros all make for an entertaining experience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after about an evening's play with this toy, I grew bored, and left it to the kids to enjoy.<br /><br />This is a well engineered product, with turn on a dime performance, long battery life, and solid construction - hence the 4 stars.<br /><br />~A_E~
B008YKGQR4|3.0|It was usable but had a little trouble negotiating around. I would use it if I was desperate to know a few things
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book presented a unique perspective on the different aspects of Germany during Hitler's reign. The point of view and the play on color is what makes this book so interesting. The characters come across as authentic as they are not portrayed in any light as glamorous but their flaws are highlighted and developed to create a connection to the reader.
B0036G1T78|5.0|Very believable!  Have never seen Redford in a bad movie and the suspense in this one had me on edge.  Robert Redford as a government agent who reads books has to go undercover to find out who murdered his co-workers.  He displayed impressive improvisation to find the killers, with a few surprises along the way.  Excellent!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Special effects are better than most zombie movies and the story and characters are very interesting as well. I recommend starting at the first season and watching them all.
B0057O6IMS|5.0|There is no in-between when it comes to Fulci. You either hate his films, or love them.<br />I fall into the latter.<br />I love this movie, and have sat through it numerous times. This DVD looks amazing. Highly recommended to anyone who loves Fulci films as much as I do.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was riveting in that both Tris and Tobias' views were included. I have to say that I was surprised at the outcome.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|it could happen, if a virus hit the earth..maybe not walking dead people but really mean killers..hope not ever. but i never thought some things going on today would ever be possible????????
B000J5XS3C|4.0|They seem to have updated this product a little bit.<br />The chassis on this wasn't made of plastic. Mine is metal, and it isn't the greenish color it looks like in the main amazon photo, its dark and has a new logo.<br />They seemed to have read the reviews regarding the bright blue light. Mine shipped with an orange led instead.<br /><br />Pretty sturdy little unit.<br /><br />I noticed a tiny hum when using this with my nicer equipment, and I noticed a larger hiss when using this with my crappy equipment. At any rate, don't crank the mids, and don't overdo the highs.<br /><br />I used the 1202FX when I DJd in bars. Not a bad device.<br /><br />Still playing with it, but I like it.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|It is one of the most interesting and well written book I have read in ages. Maybe I feel this way because I know her age. I'm getting a good history lesson about Pakistan, while having my spirits lifted by this amazing young woman. I've not completely finished the book as yet, but I've already told several people to get a copy (especially women). Malala is the 21st century Joan of Arc, Mother Theresa rolled into one.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love this app!  It works well on my kindle fire and is very fluid. The calculator works better than the calculator on my phone, which is the HTC DNA. I would recommend this to anyone!  GOOD JOB DEVELOPERS!
B00E0SX118|5.0|I loved this movie! It was very funny, and a sweet family story. It was touching and yet exciting enough to hold our interests!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Bought as a Birthday gift and it went over great.  Have uploaded to all other media and have really enjoyed it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really liked this weather program it covered so many areas not only the weather in my area, but you can pull up up to four different areas all over the USA or across the seas as well. It has the weather from the time you get up in the morning, throughout the day into the evening, then into the next day. You can get weather for the whole week and into the next week as well. It has a lot to offer including videos, maps, and the news. I think this app is for anyone who really wants a complete update on all kinds of weather before going to work or just going outside. I give this a major thumbs up.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy Crush Saga is a fun game that sucks you right in and before you know it you're twenty levels in. I love that this game has so many levels in it. I would have given it five stars if it were possible to have more than five lives at a time without paying for than via IAPs.
0525478817|5.0|You will, in the course of reading this book laugh, cry, be angry, be sad, be annoyed, and at the very be glad you read it.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I have loved nearly all the Halo books, and this was no exception. Engaging, well written and true to the Halo universe. You don't have to play the game to appreciate the depth of the story, the intense and realistically drawn characters, or the steady action! Highly recommend. The consistency of tone across the various authors in this series is impressive, but Eric Nyland has a unique and very enjoyable writing voice, in particular.
B00D48BT5A|5.0|Right up there with the best of Bill Bryson, he captures the real people, not the story book heroes. This is a great journey into a year in America with some its most colourful people. The enigma that was Lindbergh and the still unexplainable way people of the world, not just Americans, celebrated his achievement. A cast of great names known by all and the way they realy were. A wonderful read, most highly recommended!
B0070ZLZ1G|2.0|So many things are wrong with this book! It starts out with a clearly stated thesis but devolves quickly into frustratingly divergent, uncoordinated and sometimes blatantly unrelated material. The author's arguments about the flaws in intelligence testing have already been far better presented many other places, but are treated like startling new material.<br /><br />The content meanders without clear purpose and slumps into un-engaging,disjointed, and overly detailed observations and interviews with disadvantaged students and their teachers for long stretches. It never recovers from that state into a coherent, cohesive or compelling conclusion.<br /><br />Perhaps most frustrating was the completely glaring and incomprehensible gap between what the author's stories and cited research actually suggest and what he presents as a conclusion. Everything in the book clearly demonstrates that it is quality parenting in consistently safe and stable households that creates character, prevents the destructive impacts of a continuously overloaded physical stress response system, and provides children with the resources (emotional/mental/disciplinary) that they need to be successful - particularly starting at a young age when the child is most malleable and developing the fastest. This is true no matter where you live or what socioeconomic level you are. Yet the book's entire focus in on the education system, with an emphasis on middle and high schools mitigating and compensating for the damage done (and still occurring!) on the homefront. The clumsily written conclusion also unsuccessfully attempts to draw national spending on anti-poverty measures into the equation somewhere. After spending an entire book (albeit disjointedly)demonstrating that a lack of stable homes and properly equipped parents is the root of the problem, the author never so much as squeaks about addressing those issues in way.<br /><br />In short, there are a lot of commonly discussed threads here, but they not capably handled and this is not worth your time. If you're looking to read about how our children are over-protected and never get the chance to learn how to make choices and handle failure, try [[ASIN:1601421125 Do Hard Things: A Teenage Rebellion Against Low Expectations]]. If you want to learn more about why our education system seems so inadequate to the needs of today, try [[ASIN:0945700040 The Underground History of American Education: A School Teacher's Intimate Investigation Into the Problem of Modern Schooling]]. If you're looking for a much better exploration of how home life and early physical/neurological development impact children's likelihood to grow up into either criminals or successful citizens, try [[ASIN:0307378845 The Anatomy of Violence: The Biological Roots of Crime]]. Whatever you pick, skip this one!
B0063M22QO|5.0|great game while sitting waiting for anything,doctor's appointment,kids at dentist,plane or just in stopped traffic. It's fast and enjoyable. you can also mute sound.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Stellar acting, upbeat music, but quite disturbing to young children.  This is best watched with a group of friends who throw popcorn at the TV.  Humor very similar to Monty Python, although not as many memorial lines.
B00B5AAW52|5.0|I was extremely nervous to purchase this after reading all of the reviews, and I had intentions of sending it back as soon as I received it.  However, the new 2013 collection does NOT have the cardboard slots, as many of the reviewers complained about.  There are 7 plastic cases, just as if you bought all seven of the seasons separately.  I received all of the discs without any doubles or missing discs.  I have not yet watched them to make sure that they don't skip, but there are no scratches or smudges on any of the discs.  What a relief!
B00471TLZS|5.0|The movie is excellent, 1990's special effects (which were stellar at the time, and probably cheesy by today's standards) notwithstanding.  Steven Spielberg at his best.  The family's love for each other comes through loud and clear, and that is where the tension comes from, when the kids are threatened, and the parents risk losing each other to save the kids.  Excellent.  But amazon's digital failed on me three times, and (not amazon's fault) the computer went to sleep periodically because we were not moving the cursor.  Next time, I'll buy or rent the physical video.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Story & characters continue to be engaging.  Very well done and highly recommended.<br />Can't get myself to stop watching these series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Being &quot;do it or die trying&quot; type person makes this a dangerous game for me.  If I can't pass a level it becomes an obsession! Not good when my &quot;To Do List&quot; has become a 4 volume collection!  Like those fancy boxed sets.  But life is way too short to stress about so...forget what you should do and indulge in some &quot;Candy Crush Saga&quot;.  YOU will probably love it!
B0030B811Q|5.0|Love it Love it Love it!!!!!!!!!! A great fun movie. Woody Harrelson is terrific as is the rest of the cast. You will love it too.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Seriously it's that good. There are a bunch of different typing options and its predictive text is amazing. It also shows you how more efficient it makes you as a typer over time. It's generally one of the first things I put on a new Android device.
B00FN811SY|5.0|this is the best library anyone could ever invest in!!! I am so happy to have this library to take with me where ever I go. this is a wonderful provision from our loving father to help us to understand his loving guidance.I am truly thankful. LOVE IT!!!!  I absolutely recommend everyone to get this app
B000FC130E|4.0|Neil Gaiman has a wonderful imagination and pulls you into his books from the first page. This one was no different. I couldn't put it down!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have never been disappointed with a john Grisham book,well,maybe once.<br />The fact that every character was in this book from A Time to Kill made it so much easier to read. You felt like you knew everyone.<br />I LOVED this book. You may have topped yourself  with this one Mr.Grisham!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Awesome app. Very enjoyable. It is good for kids of all ages. Nice graphics. I enjoy the conversation the monsters have at the table, it's cute.
0812993357|5.0|Indeed this is a book Grace wrote only after all of us met her at the &#34;September issue&#34; documentary.<br />I found it easy to read, funny, serious and highly educative. If you are interested in knowing more about her:do read it. From my point of view you will not learn much of her past, but you will learn how she made her way through in the business of fashion.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Many of my friends were playing this game and told me how addictive it was and finally I broke down and started playing it.  Now it is hard to stop.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|When u watch Downton Abbey, you can't wait until season 2 and then it seems like forever until season 3. Now I can't wait for season 4. There are very few movies I'll watch again, but this series is one of them. I recommend this highly.
B001AQMBNC|5.0|This is a very touching movie and I did cry at the end.  Karen Allen is great and Jeff Bridges is flawless in his portrayal of an alien.  If you like love-stories, then you'll love this movie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Can't wait to see how the movie will turn out. The style of writing was unique and perfect for the story being told.
B0006B2A42|5.0|This movie kept me on my toes and I highly recomend it to anyone who likes suspense.  If you like super action movies, you won't like this one.  But if you're from the older generation that's not used to todays fast paced action, you'll really enjoy it.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|This app drain my battery was work fine for a while. Had to uninstall. Don't know if i should reinstall
B004GGQMRY|5.0|You'll laugh and cry watching this movie.  Dustin Hoffman is superb!  There is a brief nude sceen so not appropriate for kids.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|And the Grammy goes to....even better than their last stellar effort. !! Amazing!! Do not miss this great CD!! Not enough superlatives!
B001JNNDEW|3.0|Probably most people won't like this movie but I thought it was cute.  Have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it.  Some parts were stupid but all in all I liked it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love this series! I love this show but the books are so much better! I can't wait for the next book!
B00CEF014E|3.0|The idea behind the book wasn't a bad one, but I felt like I was reading a first draft. There were a lot of holes in the story, and the lack of transitions from one scene to the next created a disjointed feeling.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I play Guild Wars 2, which requires either a keyboard or a keypad for the left hand. This keypad replaces the keyboard while I'm playing and is much more comfortable. It can be angled to your comfort, and the keys can be programmed to suit how you play the game and how your fingers are comfortable. My only complaint is the the palm pad isn't 'bulgy' enough and can't be replaced or adjusted for more support, but that is a minor issue really. I'm able to keep the keypad connected all the time, so the keyboard is usable most of the time and it's just a matter of swapping it out when game time comes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this game! I play it all the time lol it is fun and addicting. I think I even play it more than my little sisters.
B00G32OER4|1.0|wow this was suppossed to be the next Big horror hit all it was was a rehashed horror movie that added in the excosist , crap boring
0871404133|5.0|Wilson's experiences and insights into social insects help explain the social advances of humans along with the history and possible future of the planet.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|So far we are really loving this season. Plus Anazon makes it really to catch up on any episodes you miss!
B005LJETYI|5.0|I blew through this novel.  The pacing, storytelling, and plot were very entertaining.  I found this to be thematically reminiscent of novels like The Forever War and Old Man's War, so if you enjoy that type of SciFi you'll enjoy this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The best game of the year hands down five stars a ten.0 I love this game and its free ya
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was very well written, but I skipped over some of the technical information, because I'm not in the medical field.  I got the feeling that he was presenting a case to people in the medical field, which I completely understand.  I thought it interesting that his experience was much more than the light at the end of the tunnel.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I love it and the options to make my own combinations is amazing.<br />I do wish it had more sound options but for the free version i think it works pretty good.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I love Dr who and never got to see it from the beginning. Now I will be able to start with this Dr and series, from the beginning. I would refer this program to everyone who enjoys good SyFy.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|Cartoon story with many levels.  Archetypal characters with great voices and physicality. Lots of fun.  I highly recommend this film. See it.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|My husband and I watch this program constantly. I tape them for him while he's at work so we can watch what has been on together through the week when he is home. We are almost finished with this dvd and love rewatching them. We just can't get enough, and now we always have them at our fingertips since we have every series so far.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Complex characters well acted by fine cast.  Themes of public and private betrayal and loyalty.  Well written scripts with surprising outcomes .
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|As usual, this book is great in giving underdogs a reason to believe that something can be done!  It helps to know that it' okay to find another way to get things done by collaborating and communicating with others.  It has been exciting to read the satisfaction that some underdogs have achieved by thinking differently.  Love it so far!
020530902X|5.0|I write quite a bit for work and find that I get stuck on simple rules I know I know, but I'm not sure I remember. You know what I mean? I keep this on the shelf by my desk and use it to look things up quickly. Some rainy day, I'll pull it out and read it from cover to cover and I am sure my writing will be better for it. But for now, it's my word-nerd problem-solver.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can play it on my computer, my Android, and now FINALLY on my Kindle!!  Let the addiction and fun continue!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Just finished Conrad Black's Flight of the Eagle and it was nice to drill down on just one year in a lighter vein.
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|All of the cuts on this album by Avicii are supurb! There is such a variety of contemporary musical evolutions present. The performing artists represent a variety of musical styles. The songs are lyrically and musically very classic and are presented in  a great up to date format. This collection never disappoints and is full of supurbly executed surprises! These tracks are great in every sense of the word!!! I plan to recommend this album to all of my family and friends.
0316056898|3.0|Often entertaining, but occasionally a little awkward - sometimes there is TMI. Disappointing because I expected to love this book since I think Fey is hilarious.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I am not much for playing games, but this one is cute and silly and makes me laugh. Fun little time passer!!
078689136X|3.0|Not especially well written, and the first 20% of the book is slow going. But an entertaining read for fans of the TV show. I enjoyed the first mysteries in the series more than this one.
B001J2WNE4|4.0|Time title is aptly used. I enjoyed this project, especially Quickly! The Collabos were chosen carefully and the production is great.
0547258305|5.0|This is young adult fiction in the sense that it is fiction about young adults, but I wouldn't necessarily say it is written FOR young adults. It falls somewhere in between YA fiction and \\"adult\\" fiction. I loved this book. I loved Katsa, I loved the world building, I loved the way the romance was handled. I recommend this!
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|When I listened to this album my first thoughts were the Black Album with a hint of Appetite for Destruction. While some of the songs may be a little too &#34;influenced&#34; by those albums such as This Means War having a guitar riff similar to Sad But True overall the album is enjoyable for those who miss a good, honest Metal/Rock album. The guitar work is great as usual with A7X, but it is more of a raw sound than some of their work. Their new drummer does a good job, nothing flashy, but I read that he was asked to keep it simple. Vocals are gritty and this album doesn't feature a lot of supporting vocals from the rest of the band as on other albums, again they have gone for a more raw sound here. Overall I think if you like 90s Metal/Rock, you are an A7X fan (especially if you like their self titled album) then you will like this one.
1416972242|5.0|I didn't like this book as much as I liked City of Bones, but it was definitely an above average YA fantasy novel. I've never really liked Jace, and I didn't like Clary much in this book. However, I really like Magnus, Alec, Isabelle, Luke, and Maia. I would definitely recommend this series.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|This album is a rock masterpiece... think Joan Jett if she was a knock-out and could wail like a banshee. The song writing is good focusing on coming of age/broken heart-type themes mostly, but very appealing to most anyone. The guitar work is good, pure rock with nothing too flashy, but also nothing too simple or contrived. The true beauty of this album is in Lzzy's vocals (yes, that is how she spells it) which are amazing! She exudes emotion and charisma that you just don't get from most singers in the rock genre these days. I enjoyed this album so much that I have actually purchased it twice after my original digital download of it was lost.
1439177791|4.0|Not always easy to read, but de Rossi writes well and is an engaging storyteller. If you like any of de Rossi's projects I would definitely give this a read.
B007MDB71O|3.0|This movie has so much potential... great story, good actors that have performed well in other movies I have seen them in plus some nice special effects, but somehow it manages to fall short of what it should be. I didn't dislike the movie by any means, but it doesn't draw me in and make me anxious to see what happens next. Instead I found myself marvelling at some of the special effects, confused about some of the plot details left unanswered and at times somewhat bored as it is a long movie. I can see why some Disney execs were rumored to have been fired over this movie, it had the potential and budget of a mega-blockbuster, but just doesn't deliver. If you can buy it cheap it is worth at least one watch if you are a fan of sci-fi, but I wouldn't set my expectations too high or you will be disappointed.
055357342X|4.0|These books are getting more and more depressing, but they are so good, and I can't stop reading them. Martin is so good at world building and character development.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|If you are a die hard Star Trek fan who clings to every detail of the original series/movies then this movie isn't for you. First off it takes one of the most loved stories in the series and one of the most hated/feared villains and turns them on their head. Personally it took me a few views to embrace JJ Abrams' first Star trek movie, but I have learned to love it as I opened my mind to the premise of what would happen to an established &#34;universe&#34; if major, catastrophic events occurred that reshaped it. This idea is taken further in the newest movie in the series as what we know of Star trek is stretched and reshaped further by Abrams and crew. The plot is good, the action is great with just the right amount of humor and the special effects again are top notch especially in the 3D version. Watch with an open mind and enjoy, this isn't your parents' Star Trek!
0385344228|4.0|Interesting and suspenseful. Good use of an unreliable narrator to keep the reader questioning. My main issue with the book was that there were no characters that were even remotely likable.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Do you like metal/rock music? If so then you will like this album. Guitar work is amazing at times (the riff for Scream gave me goose bumps the first time I heard it) plus the drum work is pretty amazing at times without being too overpowering or flashy. The diversity in sound from song to song is really good as well, no hearing 2 or 3 songs that sound almost identical. Not exactly what you would expect from a typical A7X album, but that isn't a bad thing here. In the end just crank it up, rock out and enjoy!
0345535421|5.0|These books will destroy your life because they are never happy but they are so good that it is worth it. So good, recommend to all fantasy fans.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a quick and easy alarm clock. Great for travel. I take my kindle everywhere so if I need a quick reminder I just pop a new alarm in and it is there ringing.
0553593714|5.0|It took me a while to get into this book, in part because of all of the different characters and storylines. However, once I connected with some of the characters I couldn't put the book down and sped through it. I've heard people complain that it is confusing keeping track of everything that is happening, but I didn't find that to be true (perhaps my fondness for Russian epics helped with that!)
B009NY43NY|4.0|If you've read the other Sookie Stackhouse novels, this one is a must read.  Charlaine Harris does a nice job of wrapping up the series.
0375842209|4.0|Very sad, but the way it was written was very interesting. I'm not sure I think it was as great as I'd been told, but it was good, and it did evoke emotions. I would definitely recommend it to people who are interesting in WWII.
B00FWAZ87I|5.0|Finished my first time through.  Left me feeling like I need to spend more time listening and really exploring the album.  Its great to encounter music that has that kind of depth.
030758836X|4.0|Disturbing and suspenseful. I don't think a book has ever made me this angry, except for maybe Gone With the Wind. I wasn't even sure if I liked it after finishing it, but I think Flynn did such a great job of pulling the reading and and of evoking a lot of emotion.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|One of those action-adventure-superhero films that you can go back to again and again. Pure fun. The Avengers is better the 5th time around.
0307950689|3.0|Some of the major plot twists in the book were very easy to figure out early on. I was also frustrated by the fact that people who were supposedly so into history + mythology missed some major and obvious clues.
B00866JL96|5.0|if you love chick flicks like my self this is a great movie. I have watched this movie about five times and oh yea I will see it again there is nothing like good love stories you never get tired of them.  catwoman.
0812550706|3.0|I found it difficult to believe that the character was as young as he was because of some of his behaviors. The ending seems very rushed, especially after all of the setup. Too be fair, my knowledge of some of Card's more closed-minded personal views probably affected my opinion of the book.
B00BB67UNW|4.0|I really liked this movie had a good story line and action thought it was good would watch it again.  catwoman
0786838655|4.0|Combines mythology with a modern day story very well. A lot of the \\"mysteries\\", both big and small, were obvious, but the overall story was well done. Definitely a good book for kids that like mythology.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This brilliant work is not just for science fiction junkies. While there are sufficient sci-fi staples (like aliens, futuristic technology, and space travel), there is enough substance to this book to make it appealing to just about anyone. It's packed full of suspense, action, political discourse, and a deep examination of the ethics of warfare that isn't for the feint of heart.<br /><br />The fate of the human race rests on the shoulders of a child prodigy named Andrew, or \\"Ender\\" as he is known to others. This young genius has been faced with the impossible task of ending an interplanetary war by using previously unheard of battle strategies. Through a series of war games, Ender must command an army of children scarcely older than himself to overcome an alien race and put an end to the war for good.<br /><br />What is the most profound about this book is its unapologetic and ruthless examination of human nature and the ethics surrounding warfare. Is there any cost too high to ensure survival? How far is too far? When it comes to government, how much control is too much? These are just a few of the questions you will grapple with as you follow Ender through his perilous journey.<br /><br />I will definitely be continuing on with the rest of this series.
055358202X|4.0|I certainly understand why Martin decided to write about certain characters in this book and the others in book 5, but I would rather have all of the major characters in each book. Out of all of the characters that get their own chapters, I care about 3/4 (and they always seem to be dying off), so the fewer characters that get specific chapters, the more likely it is that a lot of time is devoted to characters that I'm not super interested in. Nevertheless, Martin has created an epic universe and is a solid storyteller. I definitely thought this book was better than the reviews led me to believe it would be.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This show was so good that we were tempted to watch the whole season in one sitting! Make sure your kids aren't in the room though - some nudity.
1416955070|5.0|A well-written, fairly unique YA fantasy novel. One of the best YA books I have read in a while. I would definitely recommend it to fantasy fans. I don't really like Jace, but that is my ONLY complaint with the book.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|We waited for months for this to be released on DVD.  It was worth the wait!  They did a great job of keeping the story line fresh.  I have recommended this to my friends and family!
1602728631|3.0|** spoiler alert **<br /><br />A good story with likable characters. I was a bit disappointed in the nature of Martise's power, as well as the overwhelming theme of her being possessed and controlled by other people. Better than I expected, but not terrific.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|this game is great for passing time. I love how it's great for all ages too!! :) I would mainly recommend it to the ages of 6-15 :)
1439102449|4.0|My favorite of all of the Bones books that I have read so far. I still like the show better though. I would recommend this to mystery fans. Fans of the show need to realize the books are very different before reading them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is the best game in the world I'd never ask for another game .this is the awesomest game in the world
1416972250|5.0|I liked this book better than City of Ashes, but not as much as City of Bones. Although the first book in the series was the best, this series (so far) escapes the fate of many YA series in which the books drastically decrease in quality as the series goes on. I was very, very glad that the Jace/Jonathan issue got settled in this book (although it was very easy to figure out what was going to happen with that from pretty early on in the book).
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|One of the best movies of the year.  It is action packed and leave you in suspense through out the movie.  Very convenient for watching.
0307744434|5.0|I'm generally not a huge fan of books that jump around in time, but once I got about halfway into this book I couldn't put it down. The story was slow-moving, but interesting. Better than I expected.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|I watched Blackfish seven times over this last weekend and cried every single time.  I was mesmerized, traumatized, heartbroken, stunned.  I learned a world of valuable information about Orcas that I never knew before.  Sea World isn't teaching it.  EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THIS PLANET SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO WATCH IT... (including age-appropriate children...especially age-appropriate children.  In a few years, they'll be the rich and famous and influential entertainers and senators and members of the House and the White House.  Unless, of course, there are enough of those kinds of people with that power who can get it done right... HOW ABOUT NOW...? AND NOT WAIT UNTIL OUR KIDS GROW UP.<br /><br />  If I had known back in the 70s, when I took my daughter as a toddler and an elementary school student to Sea World once a week or more, what I know now... and if I had the power and fame to legislate Orcas and dolphins in captivity as criminal, and you evil, ignorant, money-greedy administrators of the \\"marine parks\\"  (SEALAND!??  REALLY??) Sealand is a segment in Black Fish and is now closed.  It was a  poor-man's version of Sea World... where the Orcas were inhumanely, crazy-wicked-bad 'taken such good care of. Can you hear my sarcasm?  Every man who has ever used these breathtaking awesome highly emotive and intelligent creatures to make money should all serve prison terms:  confined for 25 years in a bathtub.... inside a prison cell.  You can get out of it for a half hour 'show' every afternoon walking on your hands in the prison yard.<br /><br />The documentary is carefully, exquisitely, professionally, compellingly produced.  I've watched it seven times and have been brought to tears every single time.  What kind of monsters are you humans who are so egregiously abusing and neglecting the Orcas and the dolphins.  These whales come from their own families.  They speak their own languages.  The young NEVER leave their mothers' sides. NEVER. Until the mother dies.  A lotlike how humans live with their own families and cultures and languages on the land.<br /><br />It's not good enough to set them all free.  It's the best we can do at this point, and it is truly not good enough.  They desperately need to be reunited with the pods from which you kidnapped them.  Others, like Tilly, who are old and sick and have already given their best years and made a gazillion dollars for you will need APPROPRIATE care.  A VERY VERY VERY BIG (is a 100-mile square big enough...?)in the ocean.  Preferably with others who would/could socialize with him instead of viciously raking and shunning him.<br /><br />Those of you who have been in the upper layers of management, and have made the most money are greedy for more and so sociopathologically lacking in empathy and morals are no doubt too lazy and uncaring to even make an attempt to find the RIGHT (original)families for each youngster!<br /><br />What if somebody came and stole your three little kids and placed each one of them separately in another family; another country; another language and confined them in a bathtub for the rest of their lives?<br /><br />And the COVER-UPS out of the mouths of Sea World every time a trainer gets injured or killed?  Shame.  Shame all over all of you. Own it. Stand up and own it and tell us you're sorry and that you're going to begin the process of returning as many as possible back into the wild.  NOW.  (With the guidance and leadership of way more than several of the very best people who can be called experts in the species.)  You executives and administrators are beyond the pale.  You blame their injuries and their deaths, publicly, on the very CHILDREN you cheaply hire to train and show the creatures (ages from what... 16 to maybe early 30s? Most late teens and twenties.  America has fallen too far from grace.<br /><br />I commend Black Fish's producers and research specialists and trainers for contributing.  You all did an outstanding job.  Absolutely excellent.  Thank you.  And thank YOU, CNN, for having the courage to air it not just once, but I am now watching it for the seventh time over this last week.  And still crying.  And praying that God will intervene.  Soon.  He gave us dominion over the animals, and you all have done an exceptionally horrifying job of it.  There's a gigantic amount of PTSD to go around at this point.  GO.  NOW. Immediately: To your children who have loved these wondrous kin of ours trapped in tiny cement swimming pools at all the Sea Worlds...  to your priest, preacher, church and God and apologize and ask for forgiveness from all American people, and then spend the rest of your lives, and no doubt your gazillion dollars, doing your BEST to make it right for every single Orca and dolfin in captivity.<br /><br />LET US ALL BOYCOTT ALL THE SEA WORLDS on this planet until the Orcas and dolphins have been returned to the ocean.<br />Seriously.<br /><br />CNN, Please do not stop airing this documentary.  Thank you.<br /><br />Sincerely, Trisha Lisk
B00ELOOYZI|1.0|It installed with no error, but would just hang and blank the screen on the three times I tried to load it.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|Yes, some of the advice is obvious, and falls into the category of mom and apple pie.  But some is surprising, and equally true.  I very much enjoyed reading the book and comparing their nuggets of wisdom with my own experiences.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Kids enjoy it. Never gonna buy acorns though for real money so we've pretty much tapped the game out.  Otherwise fun little game with not much effort
0763668966|5.0|Such a great coffee table book, especially when you have kids.  Our 4 yr. old wants to be a map maker and so we bought this book but I'd recommend it to everyone and not just kids.  Beautifully illustrated, gorgeous vintage inspired colors. quality paper and crammed with tons of information.
0385523394|4.0|An interesting and quick read. I like the television adaptation more than the book because it balances out the serious issues with some comedy, and also because it gives you insight into more of the prisoners. I think I appreciated the book more having watched the TV show than I would have otherwise.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is a wonderful true story of ccourage and gave me an understanding of the other side of the war with the Taliban.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The best King I've read in years. Not enough free time in a day to do all the reading I want. Don't miss out for sure.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|the title pretty much tells it all :)  this movie is hilariously over the top.. but its fun and the acting overall is actually pretty good.  dont listen to the haters.. if you like over the top campy action films that are laughably unrealistic (in a good way), then you'll enjoy this one.
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|I wasn't going to watch this at all because I thought the movies would be mangled.  Then I started watching it on TV, but stopped when they decided to edit the &#34;Oeuf&#34; episode due to its subject nature. (Although why they thought fans of a horror show featuring a cannibalistic serial killer would find anything about any one episode's subject nature to be particularly objectionable, I'm not sure.  But I digress...)  Then, when I discovered that the &#34;Oeuf&#34; episode had been restored (as well as &#34;director's cut&#34; episode versions added) for this DVD set, I bought it.  And I was pleasantly surprised.  This envisioning of the Hannibal Lecter &#34;universe&#34; pulls enough from the previous incarnation for familiarity, yet clearly this is its own show.  Understanding that the material has to be adapted for television, and extended for the story arc the writer intends (up to 7 seasons, creating this origin and adapting material from Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, and Hannibal over a fully realized run of this TV show), makes this first season feel to me like the film Batman Begins did to me for Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy:  it's entertaining and satisfying on its own, but also sets up the entire saga, and owes as much to its future seasons as it does to its current fans.  For me, it's an excellent and entertaining show, and the DVD set is a worthwhile purchase.
B0089LOG02|2.0|this is an interesting story told with the expected horrible adoptive parents and the brilliant children taken in by them.  There are few surprises along the way with a typically sugary ending.
0316228583|3.0|This was a well done book overall, but it was pretty depressing, and it felt overly crass at times. I think Rowling may have been trying a bit too hard to set this apart from Harry Potter by including so much mature content.
B000FC1RCI|4.0|I always enjoy Agatha's writing and this was no exception,  but I thought her voice was not quite on par with her other works. Also, it will surely have you guessing who the killer is, but if you enjoy figuring out the killer's identity there are no real clues to do so.<br /><br />If you're a Christie fan then certainly it's worth the read,  but if you're new, it's not the best place to begin your Agatha Christie experience.
1250038820|5.0|I got my copy yesterday and couldn't put it down. The photography is great; the subjects are better. The book is also very well produced.<br /><br />But I was nevertheless disappointed. Brandon is a good writer as well as a good photographer. His fb comments about photos bring them to life.<br /><br />Someone decided to limit most accompanying text to location. A big mistake. Specific location seemed generally irrelevant.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun!  I love trying to get three stars on each level and trying to beat my friends scores!
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|Works fine with SD cards and flash drives as expected. However I was very pleasantly surprised when it also worked with my 1TB WD Passport hard drive (with only the USB power from the MLW). Also pleasantly surprised with the pass through to my home WiFi, although it took a while to setup. (My own fault. I had forgotten the WiFi password.) once everything was setup iit works like a charm automatically connecting to my home WiFi when I turn it on. Have not tried it with a hotspot so I cannot comment on that.<br /><br />Now if I could just run Windows programs on my iPad, I would be perfectly happy.
B008ROG6E0|5.0|I have always loved this movie, It's a scifi sclassic. I watched with me 13yr old daughter (she is not a scifi fan...yet)
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My son who is 10 years old and his school friends play with this item everday it is very entertaining cannot complain great buy.
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|I like the game but I do not like the drop down messages after most moves.  I am ready for the next move but I to wait for the cutesy messages.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|You might not be sure what is happening for much of the movie, but it ends up being a great story about love amongst troubles and challenges.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|I didn't see the ending coming till it was too late. It kept me guessing. I was just like the main character, till the very end.
B009NY43NY|4.0|This book series is a secret guilty pleasure of mine that most people do not know I read. And, yes, I watch True Blood but they are completely different animals.I was very eager to read this but disappointed that this would end it all. Sookie's world is tied up very nicely and predictably but maybe not to everyone's liking. I suppose even sookie deserves some calm in her life but i had a secret wish for a different outcome. very formulaic but a must for sookie fans.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Fascinating book does a great job of describing life during the time of Jesus.  I couldn't put this book down and I was sorry to see it end.  Like I said above, even the footnotes were good reading.  I hope Aslan continues to write.  I'll buy everything he publishes.  Good, meaty reading.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is the game everyone has been talking about and it is finally on kindle,still trying to get it but i am very happy to be a part of the candy crush saga family,
0062225790|3.0|I'm only about two-thirds through it (so NOT something you &#34;can't put down&#34;), and am finding the minute details of various early experiments tedious (how to track when and how a fly stops to groom itself or a chicken pecks), but moments of insight here and there. I expected more theological/philosophical material. (Maybe it'll come later!)
B0001WTVUW|5.0|This movie will haunt you.  It could happen.  We were under the constant threat by Russia for years.  Each one with enough firepower to destroy the planet. Now we have to worry about Iran or North Korea or a dirty bomb.  If you want to see what  &#34;could&#34; happen, and &#34;would&#34; happen if a bomb were detonated in or around your town............ watch this.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|game play is good and kids like it. reminds me of super Mario bros. will keep you busy for a while
B00ENYLECC|5.0|Russell Crowe is the best actor around today, and Jennifer Connelly is both gorgeous and refined in this magnificent movie.
B00513DGIO|5.0|This is a good.book with some flaws,  the author covers a wide area -- too much area. He's got 1000 ideas, only about 3% of which are both new and important.  However, that's a far better batting average than most authors manage to achieve.  It's the reader's problem to figure out which ones are the 3%.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|My daughter loved Mary Poppins! She can't wait to watch it again. The acting and singing is simply divine and children love it.
0307341577|2.0|This novel is the reason I don't often read mysteries.  Somebody had recommended &#34;Girl, Gone,&#34; and I did enjoy that book a lot, so I thought I'd follow up with this. The plot managed to be obvious and contrived at the same time ... reminded me of a cardboard pizza.
B00021R7CG|5.0|This could have happened a dozen times during the cold war.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat, and really gives you food for thought these days.  Russia might not be the current threat, but North Korea and Iran have the nukes..........
B008SGMPVU|3.0|I loved this movie when I first saw it on VHS. People who pan the picture quality should know a couple of things about it. It was filmed as a college project by John Carpenter and it was filmed mostly on 16mm stock. This movie is never going to look like BlueRay. The 16mm format is not an HD format and most of the detail and sharpness we expect from BlueRay simply doesn't exist in the source material.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|This is a great family movie.  My kids, husband and I all love it.  Puts a new twist on an old story.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|My lad loves games where you can build and tinker, and this fits the bill perfectly. Works really well on his 1st Gen Google Nexus 7.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|Yuch! This was honestly a horrible movie to watch so don't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT RENT OR BUY. IT WAS BORING AND DUMB
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't even know if it's that great a game, I just know I can't stop playing.  Other than the fact you have to have friends help to get to different worlds, no complaints.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|The download was easy. It covers a wide variety of news so you don't need any other papers.concise and gives a fair news report.
B00DXP0QX0|3.0|Lyric changes were interesting, but song versions were generally of little difference from earlier releases. No significant value to those who own the originals already.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Achieved orbit from Venus! Landed on the moon and lost a probe on Jupiter! Simple Rockets could use some better navigational aids, but other than that, it is a blast!!!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Same interface, layout and functionality as the desktop version which makes playing the game all the more fun and easy on a tablet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Opportunities to buy and earn additional horses.  Lots of ways to play with enough choices to make it personal. I especially like that you do not have to purchase gems or coins to progress.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a fun and easy game.  I like it very much and will recommend this game to other people.
B009T9P7OC|5.0|For a while now I've been looking for the perfect replacement for the Kindle Fire HD music app. Amazon's app seems to lock up frequently, the interface is sometimes cumbersome, and it doesn't scrobble my tracks to Last.FM.  I've tried several others, including WinAmp, and more recently, the Gone Mad Music Player, which is perfectly adequate.  The GMMP interface is better than Amazon's, it doesn't lock up, and if you use Simple Last.FM Scrobbler, it will scrobble your tracks.  But every time I download music to my kindle, I have to run a scanner to get it into GMMP, and the interface sometimes feels like it's designed for a phone more than a tablet.<br /><br />I found jetAudio Plus for the Kindle Fire to be a notch better than the others I've tried.  It's a beautiful program; it appears to have been designed for tablets as well as phones (unlike GMMP and Winamp). For instance, you can view albums as a grid that fills your whole screen, rather than a list that only makes use of the left hand side of the screen on a tablet. I've been running it for a while, and it hasn't locked up once.  The controls are pretty intuitive, making it easy to get around.  And, it scrobbles music to Last.FM using the default Last.FM app.  It has a fair number of audio extras to improve sound quality, and they seem to work pretty well. The downside, of course, is you can't stream music from your Amazon Cloud; you need to download your music with the kindle app first. Once downloaded, jetAudio automatically finds it (no need to scan), and you can start playing and scrobbling right away. Sometimes it doesn't keep the album art from Amazon Cloud Player. Thankfully, it has a &#34;download album art&#34; function that works, but it's rather cumbersome.  JetAudio also seem to be lacking a tag editor and the ability to make smart playlists, both of which can be found in GMMP. Because of this, if 4.5 stars were an option, that's what I'd give it, but I'm feeling generous enough today to give it 5 stars over 4.<br /><br />I downloaded the free version first, and I found that some features that were listed as &#34;paid only&#34; were actually included with the free &#34;basic&#34; version, including scrobbling.  So it would be a good to check out the free version first. To be honest, the only reason why I paid for this app was to make the ads go away, which are pretty intrusive. Another reviewer mentioned still having ads after paying for the app, but I did not have that problem.  I bought the &#34;plus&#34; app, uninstalled the &#34;basic&#34; app and then opened the &#34;plus&#34; app with no ads.tars over 4.<br /><br />I downloaded the free version first, and I found that some features that were listed as &#34;paid only&#34; were actually included with the free &#34;basic&#34; version, including scrobbling.

B00DJZR46G|5.0|Songwriting and return to emphasis on piano as lead instrument show Elton is in great form after all these years.  T. Bone Burnett influence is evident in the song composition and display of some great piano solos and more planful use of other instrumentation. Truly enjoyable album.
B001J9AQA0|4.0|I really had a hard time deciding whether to give this 3 or 4 stars. I really like the songs they play on the radio, but I was unimpressed with the others on the CD. I played it several times just to see if they would grow on me, but they haven't. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something about several of their songs reminds of the 1980's music. Not that it is good or bad, it just is. While the album is filled with the typical \\"Woe is me. She broke my heart\\" kind of music, the lyrics are different. It is if the band has a fresh perspective on heartache. That is why I decided to give 4 stars.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great game play it every chance I get.  I don't have to buy any coin if I don't want to and it is fun
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Very good Book... Couldnt put it down.<br />Finished both the books in 2 weeks and cant wait for the next one to come out..
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|We all love this movie. There is something for everyone.  Dad, Mom, son and daughter all stayed awake, active, and engaged. Great for family movie night.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|For Sci-Fi lovers this series is reAlly interesting. Meet buggers, piggies and humans all which have something to teach us.
1449305172|5.0|Running Lean takes us from hard to implement theory to practical tricks & templates that one can just use off the shelf.
006202406X|4.0|To all those 1-star raters who loved the previous books in the series but felt that the ending of this book was \\"out of character\\" and  \\"written only for shock value,\\" try reading the book again. The ending is actually well foreshadowed by the summation of the following quotes:<br /><br />1.\\"The Abnegation say you should only let someone sacrifice himself for you if it's the ultimate way for them to show they love you.\\"<br /><br />2. \\"I would never deliver you to your own execution.\\"<br /><br />I personally felt that the ending was fitting, and that Tris showed how much she has grown by her message to Tobias. No longer is she the impulsively selfless person jumping into the situation because she thought she had to--now she is an analyzing young adult who makes the hard choices even when she knows she doesn't have to. I also enjoyed the epilogue and Tobias' (the book's) message to us at the end.<br /><br />I docked a star because I found this book to be somewhat repetitive at places and uneccesarily verbose at some spots--but otherwise Allegiant, and the entire trilogy, is a fun read!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Good bood, with a surprise ending.  I now plan to read more of Nicholas Sparks books in the near future
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|how can I rate this and play at the same time...warning...start and you are hooked...gotta crush on candy crush...careful...if you start...you will to...sweet dreams!
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Well done, wish there were more like Stargate SG-1 around, Good story line and fun to watch over and again.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a spinoff of the game Bejeweled.  It goes a bit further and has a couple of extra challenges to complete before you can complete a level.  It becomes a bit addicting.  It doesn't cost anything to continue like candy crush does.
B00FKTDKTO|5.0|Great album. One of his best. Cant stop listening to this one song Queenie Eye. Too fun. Hooe you luv it too.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Yeah you can say this movie is unoriginal and it definitely borrows from a lot of elements, but hey it you like incredible action sequences this movie is for you. If your looking for a unique story with a gripping story arc with character development look elsewhere.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love trying to get the hang of this game.  It's fun bumping into the minions. I haven't gotten the full hang of this game but enjoying the time.

B002VWNIAY|5.0|Casablanca is from 1942 - why does it say 1948 in the product headline??!!  Would Amazon please clarify this!<br /><br />One of the greatest films made, timeless, brilliant, never tire of watching it.

1781162646|5.0|I'm still reading it but what I have read so far has me hating to have to put it down.  I can't wait to finish it.  I have an acquaintance who bought it and read the last chapter.  She tried to tell me the end but promised her mayhem if ruined it for me.  I love the feel of a fresh book and the feel of the paper in my hands.  I have it on my iPod but reading it with glass of ice water or tea is heavenly!
B005OHSTY8|4.0|It is an interesting film for Kevin Smith to delve into. i dont want to spoil anything so see it if the synopsis peaks your curiosity.
0545615402|5.0|My eleven year old just finished reading all of the Harry Potter books. She was always going on about how she wished she could go to school at Hogwarts. I thought this set of textbooks would make a perfect Christmas present for her. When I received them in the mail I was surprised by the amazing quality of the case and book covers. They are hardcovers with a nice weight to them. I have yet to see the inside, but I am sure it will be just as amazing as the outside.
B000FC12C8|5.0|This is the most famous book ever written about the practical way to achieve wealth over time; this is the system Warren Buffett used to put together his enormous estate and improve the lives of investors who bought his fund, Berkshire Hathaway.  Mostly it is an easy read, although there are difficult parts which are handled with a little effort.  I recommend it to any person desiring fine investment results.  David A. Cobb.
B00D48BT5A|4.0|I thought this lacked some of the usual Bryson trademark wit and spark, but it was still fun and interesting and well worth reading.
0061801313|5.0|if you like the series you will like the books. the outcomes and paring of characters are somewhat different but compliment the plots. I prefer books that compliment the series overall and do not deviate so much from the series which is far better
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It's fun and creative. I can put the things that I wrote down and pick them up whenever I need them.
B0019NG73G|5.0|Best Civil War movie ever made. Great casting and authentic battle scenes. The added footage made the film better. The bonus features were interesting.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|A chilling story of futuristic oppression and young people's response to the new moral order. It often mirrors the excesses of ancient Rome. Action packed. Looking forward to watching the sequel.

B006BAEQB2|4.0|Whereas Philippa Gregory's [[ASIN:1476735484 The White Queen]] followed the life of Elizabeth Woodville (a Queen of York and mother of the Princes in the Tower) and [[ASIN:1476746303 The Red Queen]] concerned itself with Margaret Beaufort (a Countess of Lancaster and mother of Henry Tudor VII) \\"The Kingmaker's Daughter\\" pivots the point-of-view for a third time in order to concentrate on a young woman who was the mother of no lasting legacy, but who was deeply caught up in the intrigues and violence of the War of the Roses. Anne Neville was the wife of Richard III and the Queen of England for two years, yet despite this, Gregory has chosen to give her (and the book's title) a moniker that refers to her relationship to her father.<br /><br />Told in first-person narrative (as have all the previous books in this series) Anne Neville describes her childhood as one in which she is constantly in the shadow of her older and more attractive sister Isabel. Her father is Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, the mentor and councilor of King Edward IV, and one of the most powerful men in the country. Known as the \\"king-maker\\" for his skill at political wrangling that led to the deposition of King Henry and the rise of Edward as the new King of England, all seems well for the Neville family as they ascend ever-higher in wealth and status. Though she has no brothers, Anne and her sister are still valuable commodities, and likely to be coveted brides once they are of marriageable age.<br /><br />But then fortunes change, and the Neville family find themselves losing influence with the King after he marries in secret and upsets Warwick's plans at foreign policy. The new Queen Elizabeth Woodville is beautiful and charming and irresistible - and she has a dangerous amount of authority over her husband, putting her own family members into positions of power and arranging marriages that shove the Neville girls into the shadows. Anne and Isobel find themselves as little more than pawns in their father's desperate attempts to win back the power he lost - first it is Isobel and her unborn child that he plans to put on the throne of England, then it is Anne herself once he has her married to the exiled son of the very king that he helped overthrow.<br /><br />Once a staunch supporter of the Yorks, Anne now finds herself married to a Lancastrian at the head of an army that marches on England. With the terrifying she-wolf Margaret of Anjou as a mother-in-law, Anne struggles against the complete lack of control she has over her own life, utterly confused as to where her allegiances should lie. Gregory very much captures Anne's inability to decide on her own fate and her desperate desire to seize... not *power* exactly, but some degree of agency. Anne's story is one that deals with the bafflement that arises when her father switches sides in his own bid for power, as well as her feelings of insignificance when he shortchanges her sister and decides that Anne will instead be the one to put a Neville heir on the throne of England.<br /><br />Such was the role of women in those days, where their loyalties were determined by the men in their lives and they were valued mostly for ability to produce an heir to continue the hereditary line. Even when Anne finds some degree of happiness with her childhood friend Richard, she's constantly aware of her own failings as a brood mare, and the tenuous position she holds as Queen. Perhaps more than any other woman in this series, Anne understands the shifting tides of fortune.<br /><br />Having read \\"The White Queen\\" and \\"The Red Queen\\" prior to this, it was quite fun to get yet a third perspective of the events that take place, and Anne's viewpoint on Elizabeth Woodville is particularly interesting. Whereas Elizabeth was depicted in \\"The White Queen\\" as a benevolent and sympathetic figure, Anne sees her as a cold and heartless witch, whose ambition and magical powers are the source of all of Anne's woe.<br /><br />Since this is the third time that Gregory has dealt with these events, I can't help but suspect that by this time she was getting a little bored with the subject matter. Less of a power-player than Elizabeth and Margaret, Gregory does not quite seem as invested in Anne's story as her predecessors, and the moments in which Anne *does* assert some level of authority seem rather glossed over - an odd creative choice considering the central theme of the book is that of the powerlessness women faced back in the 15th century. At times certain scenes felt rote rather than inspired.<br /><br />Anne's relationship with her sister was hard to pin down (are they devoted to each other, or are they petty and jealous?) and her marriage to Richard fraught with a sense of deception (though this at least plays out well, with neither Anne nor the reader certain as to his true intentions toward her). And inevitably, because of how the real Anne's history played out, the end of the book comes with less of a bang and more of a whimper, as Anne herself simply gives up on life and fades away well before the climactic battle that ended Plantagenet rule in England.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed \\"The King-maker's Daughter\\", especially for the flipped perspective that it provides for the events in \\"The White Queen\\" and the figure of Elizabeth Woodville. The paranoia that overcomes the Neville sisters in their fear of Elizabeth is especially interesting, not just because Gregory has already portrayed Elizabeth as rather indifferent to the two of them (in \\"The White Queen\\") but because historically speaking we know that there is no such thing as the witchcraft and magical spells that the sisters find so terrifying. Although many liberties have certainly been taken throughout Gregory's body of work - don't believe a word she says about Elizabeth of York and Richard's intentions toward her - she does a good job in clarifying the twisted political and social intrigue that takes place in the court that Anne dreads and fears so much.Since this is the third time that Gregory has dealt with these events, I can't help but suspect that by this time she was getting a little bored with the subject matter.

B003MC5N28|3.0|Good book but horrible ending... There isn't even an actual sequel. This could've been better but a good read for imaginative people.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|W O W. I know music is completely subjective (like most forms of art) but I had to write a review for this album and as a thank you to AFI. First, I was disenchanted with the Crash Love album. Don't get me wrong, perfectly mixed, but I was not a fan of the more poppy and clearly  bright approach. Though there were a few great songs on Crash love, the album as a whole was too bright for my seasoned AFI tastes.<br /><br />This is not that album (not that there is anything wrong with that). Like judging a book by its cover (which you shouldn't do unless you want to sell books), you can tell that they went different (good) with this album. This is a return to Sing the Sorrow style. Darker. Edgier. Has the layered approach Crash Love took with the depth and rawness of Sing the Sorrow (notice I am not mentioning December Underground... for good reason). This has that mix of electric, but only dabs of it, and when it clearly adds to the song; not distracts or takes away from it (full disclosure, I like the electric touches).<br /><br />As musical tastes change and grow with time, this album clearly takes me back to a good place and has me singing (yelling) along. When you first put it in, you get a sense that you know where the music is going... and you like it. The rush of I Hope You Suffer clearly makes it mark on this album, as if saying, \\"Hell yes, we still know how to rock this\\". There is a nice ebb and flow to the album that just when you think they start to go bright they come back in dark with the next song. Superb mixing (yet again).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor: DON'T listen to this while doing tasks or screwing around with other things. Grab a really good set of ear buds (or phones) and go for a walk or travel somewhere. JUST MAKE LISTENING TO THE ALBUM YOUR PRIORITY FOR ONCE! If you don't you will miss out on a lot of layers they mixed into this album. Oh, and buy the CD so you can at least enjoy the highest level of quality on a nice stereo system(yes they still make them). Not to mention you get the MP3 with amazon's matching policy thingy... hence the reason I say grab ear buds and go; I don't suspect you are going to be toting a portable CD player around. Those days are long gone, just like my youth...till make them). Not to mention you get the MP3 with amazon's matching policy thingy... hence the reason I say grab ear buds and go; I don't suspect you are going to be toting a portable CD player around. Those days are long gone, just like my youth...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|game plays better than on my laptop!  I play it exclusively on my kindle now.  beginning to wonder why I use the laptop...lol
B00EUEWRUI|4.0|Love the music, but the plastic inserts designed to hold the Cd's and DVD in place are crap and do not hold anything, with all 3 sliding around inside the jewel case. For $23, I expected better than this kindergarten effort at storage!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Full of magic and vision a book you find yourself reading again and again. I am looking forward to his next one . A reason to believe, to hope and to rejoice. Faith all through the pages. Love it, just as much as The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is great people complain about paying for more levels but if you wait the &quot;tooth fairy&quot; will come help you get to the next episode. I love this app so.much and i am on level 70 and I didn't spend a dime o  this app. I highly recommend this app, but beware it is VERY addicting!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Man, what an awesome book! I can't believe some IDIOT killed him on the range! The book is well-written, interesting, funny, sad, somewhat horrifying.<br />Some people may view him just as a killer, but guys like this are a different breed. They have big balls, great big. I would probably freeze up or run away screaming like a wild bigfoot during some of those hairy situations they faced. Would have been neat to meet Chris!
B00EH6SK78|3.0|What I expect from DevilDriver. There is nothing particularly earth shattering on this releasr, it just has good hard metal as always.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|Great book! Nice to read and watch the movie. My third Sparks book since starting to read his...I'll be back for a fourth.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Fun and probably has some educational value.  It gets easier as you go but definitely do the training...  One day an app like this will actually allow us all to send stuff to the moon!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|IF you like the new doc who then you will like this season.  This was David Tennants last season, which was not a great move on his part, but anyway a good show.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great app for reading on a smart phone or tablet. Very easy to use, plenty of free books, plus the lighting is great for reading in bed.
B0091JQH2Q|5.0|The playing is excellent. Everything falls into place as it's supposed to: the tempi, the dynamics, the phrasing, and the emotional tug. The strings sound great, the brass has the bite it should, and the recording captures it all with proper balance. The re-mastering eliminated any tape hiss that inhered to the original. A very satisfying, authentic recording that can stand up to any. A newer recording may be better technically, but not more authentic.
B00CRS88IO|2.0|The premise caught my eye. The first couple of chapters stuck to some of the basic facts of the WWII era. THEN the action starts in France while Ian is on the run from the Germans. Puff Puff. Up and down a mountains with super human strength. With a lady friend no less. OK, it is FICTION. In one of the ambushes he has a Claymore mine being set. . .hmm, wow all of sudden Vietnam munitions. It is FICTION. Then there is a squadron of helicopters chasing Ian. . .set up as attack helicopter as if they were Apache helicopters. It is FICTION.<br />Well I won't go into more. If you want to suspend your belief on what armament, vehicles and munitions were available at the time then go ahead. It is interesting. But I have read better.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|....seriously, what was the point? All that for nothing. I would love to hear the explanation as to why she chose that ending. Way to be lame Veronica
B008Y74B10|5.0|Our current debt crisis is a combination of deficit spend and what this movie shows you. A banking system gambling away everything and leaving us to pay the bill. One part of the movie shows a list of banks and how much they loaned out. Give it a pause there and you will start to see how insanely bad of a deal WE got stuck with. As of the time of this review, the average each american would owe for this debt crisis + future liablities is around $1,000,000 each.
B0080QOLCE|4.0|This movie was a good one, it had an unexpected turn to remind us not to judge books by their covers.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|First off, this artist/writer has a wickedly sharp sense of humor. She has an amazing talent at illustrating human emotion in a fresh, minimalist style. Her drawings are extremely stylized but feel alive. She has a great sense of comedic timing. I was genuinely laughing out loud during many of the stories. The one about the goose had me in tears.<br /><br />She also lays her mental process out in the open for all to see. It's extremely raw and unguarded and she deserves a ton of credit for doing what most people wouldn't. It adds a lot to this short little book. Her sadly but precisely accurate illustration about living with depression should be shown to people aren't depressed just to give them a better idea of what they don't understand<br /><br />I was hesitant to spend what I did on the book because I've already read everything on her website. However there is some really great content in there that's new, such as the goose story and the origins of helper dog. Well worth the money, on top of supporting one of my favorite authors/illustrators.<br /><br />I'm excited to see what she does in the future.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Good movie never expected the ending . Good movie for kids not as violent and nudity that is in most now a days.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|So far we haven't had any problems with the Kindle Fire HD version of this game. The puzzles range from relatively easy to fairly challenging.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Challenging but really is enjoyable,cute characters and funny dialogue. Takes some skill to get the right angles for making the shots
B0030V0PEW|4.0|This is a great book by Gawande, and opened my eyes on the power of the simple checklist. No matter your profession, this book is worth reading. Highly recommended!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|We've all waited for it.  Thank you, Mr. King and thanks, Doc.  I can sleep (little \\"s\\") now..it's been a great ride.
B000002B2T|5.0|I just came upon this album and I can't stop listening to it.  I feel like I have a window into the lives of some of the musicians listening to it.  I know a lot of the lyrics were meant to reflect how a friend of theirs passed, but it has become a reflection of their own lives (and deaths) too.  I listen and wonder if he felt that as he sang some of those words in the songs.  &#34;This is me&#34;.  Its enough to make tears well up at times.  A lot of strong emotional currents in this album.  Its a truly fantastic piece of work!  I appreciate all that was sacrificed by these musicians a lot more after listening to this album and investigating the backstory of it too.
B00E8S2JZ4|1.0|I can't believe Peter Jackson, who I really respect, would stoop to such blatant marketing ploys simply for money.<br /><br />Does anyone remember Tarantino's Grindhouse which was great in the theater after which he brought it out for release to the public in two separate DVD's simply for money.  He clearly scammed a lot of people.  There were millions of complaints and Tarantino had to apologize for his misguided attempt to dupe the public and then released the original Grindhouse in its original format and as it was meant to be seen.<br /><br />Jackson and Co. are essentially the same thing by coming out with three (3) count em, three movies of the Hobbit, a small introductory book for children.  The actual Lord of the Rings consisted of three books and resulted in three movies each approximately 3 hours long.  Very reasonable.  Here we have the worst example ever of trying to squeeze the public into buying three separate movies, released over two or three years, at a total running length of 9 hours and at an initial cost to the public of approx. $75.<br /><br />As mentioned, The Hobbit was merely the intro to the Lord of the Rings yet they've absurdly made in into three (3) movies also at the approx. aggregate running time of 9 hours.  How is this possible?  Why isn't everyone up in arms?  Each of the three books that made up the Lord of the Rings and associated DVD's were long enough and to turn a very short introductory story into three separate movies is worst kind of profiteering.<br /><br />I am boycotting the movies and think if enough people say they're sick and tired of all the games and mercenary attitude of people and studios it might prevent this from happening again.  What's next, a six DVD version of \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\"?  Enough is enough and just remember when your watching a movie, as I was when I saw the Hobbit, or thought I was watching the Hobbit, expecting a good ending only to see the equivalent of a prompt on the screen that said\\"to be continued\\" To say I was very upset is an understatement.  I don't know if the producers adequately informed the public in advance of what they were doing but I had no idea this was just part one (1) and couldn't believe that at the end of the first installment nothing had happened.  That's the way I suspect a lot of people felt and should feel about what the producers, etc.., did regardless of how much money was spent or the quality of the production.  I'm certain they filmed the entire project at one time which also exacerbates the problem and wouldn't support triple billing of the public.  In essence, \\"I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more\\".  Neither should you
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|My phone and tablet are Android devices.  Android users can't use Chromecast as Adobe Flash Player is required for Amazon Videos and Adobe no longer plays nice with new Android  devices.  Netflix streaming never materializes as Chromecast times-out when you attempting to stream from your device to your TV.<br /><br />So promising, so disappointing!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I LOVED maze runner it was truly awesome. After I started to read it I couldn't stop. BEST BOOK EVER!
B007IK44CK|5.0|There was plenty of action and Tom was as good as ever. The whole cast fit their part well. Even my wife liked it.
0399159347|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It kept my interest from the first page and I got through it pretty quickly.  I plan to read all of her books.
B00DZJ82W6|3.0|This is a review of the box set. Three of the discs feature outtakes of the songs on the original recording. There is a good reason these are outtakes...they don't compare to the final takes. For instance there are 7 outtakes of Caravan...It would have been a better listening experience if the one or two best outtakes were selected because some of these versions are clearly inferior and a bore to listen to. None of the outtakes are better than what appeared on the original album...tho the versions of Into the Mystic and Brand New Day come close....So after giving these three discs a listen it is highly unlikely I will listen to them again....Now the original can't be surpassed...
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|Interesting overview of the US nuclear arsenal; however, I wished there was more information about the arsenal of the Soviet Union since it is one of the primary subjects of the book. Also, the explanation of the accident of Damascus could have been told in a more compact form rather than spreading the information through the entire book and analyzing other incidents while explaining Damascus.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|So far, this has turned out to be a surprisingly impressive product.  It does exactly what it says it will do!
B007K8ILTW|1.0|Kubrick's first effort proves that genius is not always born; it's often taught. And the fact that he chose to bury this movie for 60 years also shows that he knew his own potential - and how short this first effort had fallen.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|The four books in the Cousins War series are most enjoyable. It is so interesting to see many of the same characters and events through the eyes of the four different women. And even more fascinating because it depicts real events. I would highly recommend the series
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Surprise, surprise.  I am a died in the wool Grisham fan and this book is definitely not a disappointment.  A long way outside the norm for hime but a thoroughly enjoyable read.  When I finished the book the story that came to mind was The Sting.  Fantastic read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a super fun game. It is so look addicting. It is a little slow some Times and I wish it was easier to get coins,but it's ok.
B00F0O8SZK|3.0|I was eagerly looking forward to this new album, \\"Home for Christmas,\\" by my favorite singer, Susan Boyle. I was going to play it in my car and enjoy smiling and singing along all the way to work. But, after listening to it, I must say that I am disappointed. Oh, not in Susan or her voice. Susan Boyle's voice is spectacular, as always. She takes the lyrics in the songs and turns them into a story so filled with meaning that it awakens a passion in listeners like no other.  But, I had hoped to hear at least a few songs that reflected more of the secular as well as the spiritual joy of the season, toe tapping, foot stomping joy, not the usual angel choruses and soaring church music, solemn and reserved. Songs like, \\"O Come, All Ye Faithful, The Lord's Prayer, Little Drummer Boy, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, In the Bleak Midwinter,\\" compel one to say, \\"Amen!\\" You feel like you are in church whether you want to be or not.  Instead of singing, \\"Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let snow,\\" it entreats, \\"Let Us Pray, Let Us Pray, Let Us Pray!\\"<br />If an almost totally serious and religious album is Christmas singing to your liking, then, by all means, buy \\"Home for Christmas\\"; you sure won't be disappointed. But, if you want something a little more lively and quick, then listen to \\"Home for Christmas\\" before you buy it.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|That was the best $10 I've ever spent!!! I love ol' A.J. and these songs, mostly written by Allan Jackson, are ALL good!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was super excited to read this book, I preordered and everything. Was totally into it until I got the last 20 or so chapters and all I can say is WTF!! Not what I wanted to happen and I really didn't like the way the book ended, it really seemed pointless to me. I would definitely read more books by the author about the divergent world but after reading this last book I have changed my mind. That being said, the story was good and so was the writing I was just really not happy with the ending .
B0084BMUFA|5.0|An awesome all time Classic! Great reading for the entire family, a must have. Would recommend to any avid reader, belongs in everyone's Library.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|Love it.  Challenge your brain. Puzzles are cute and full of fun. You got to save adorable bugs from hungry spiders. The spiders get more difficult as you level up. You are going to out smart these spiders too. Each spider has there own trick up there sleeve so to speak. Lol it's great game. So come on show those spiders who's Boss.<br /><br />Thanks y'all for this fun and challenging game.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Just a great device to turn a non smart tv or monitor with HDMI into a streaming media viewing device. I look forward to more than Netflix, Hulu and Pandora streaming. I hope to see the ability to stream pictures as a slide show and the streaming of apps like Showtime, HBO or Dish Anywhere. I'm sure that the unit will see more features in the near future. Till then its worth the 35.00 to send netflix easily to a non smart tv.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This is such a good movie! It is incredibly beautiful and has such a good, moral and thought provoking story-line. To be honest, I thought it was going to be a child's movie and kind of boring before I watched it but that wasn't the case at all. I bought a copy for my father in-law for his birthday, it makes for a really good gift.
B005LAIGSM|4.0|Everyone talked about this so I had to watch it. I really did like it although its a little slow at first.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|goooood is the best buy where I do in my entire live, solo conecta el chromecast y listo para ver tus videos favoritos
B00G32OER4|5.0|I have gotten to the point where most movies are very predictable and do not hold my attention very well.  While the overall arc of The Conjuring follows the same path as pretty much every other &#34;haunted/possessed&#34; film, there was definitely something about the way the story moved along that held my attention and made for a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  I was extremely tense and on the edge of my seat for the entire movie.  I had both dread and eager anticipation for what was going to happen next.  I haven't been able to quite put my finger on what it was about this film that entertained me so well, but it did and I highly recommend this film.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I would like to know how can I transfer my current Level that I have reached on my phone to my Kindle?  I really don't want to start over on my Kindle.  That was hard work.  HELP.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Just so disappointed, book one was amazing and book two moved the story along nicely. Wish I had stopped there, I would have finished the story in my mind and would not be left with this feeling of complete dismay.
B00ESY6TKY|4.0|Digital copy and Amazon is great but I love my Chromecast and should have bought it thru the Play Store for convenience and easier playing on multiple devices.
B00FPH6A70|3.0|The movie was OK. I never watched a movie on the Internet before. I like the way you can start to look at it and then return to the place you stopped and do not have to start over. Very nice. I am not so sure about the authenticity of the so called exorcism. I guess I will maybe look at it again.
B00G32TD98|5.0|This is a very scary movie! I really liked it. I am going to buy it , from amazon if course. Can't get enough. And the fact that it is based on a true story makes it all the more creepier. A must see! I watch a lot of horror movies and don't get scared to the extent this one scared me. I couldn't get certain scenes out of my mind.
1451695195|4.0|The title can be misleading, but the content is a &#34;must read&#34; for people in all walks of life, scientific and cultural.  We have so much that still remains as mystery but as part of reality.
B00GD5T7KU|5.0|I can not get too much into this episode (major spoilers) but let's just say the ending will leave  you with your mouth opened in shock!
006202406X|1.0|She had to die? I love it when authors try to make you believe a death of a hero is a good thing. It is never a good thing. It just says when you are a heroe of course bad things will happen so don't be a heroe. Did she never hear about learning from your mistakes like there are a 1000 ways she could have had her learn without killing her off. Our society is so filled with people being murdered and this book is loaded with deaths, the least the author could do is give us some hope here. It is a friggin book so stop trying to tell us what had to be. When you have such loyal fanship on the first two books, you need to think about what your audience wants. We are your customers. Be creative and figure a way to have her learn the lesson but live. I hope the movies disagree with you and changes the ending. I am telling my friends to cancel their orders as they will be disappointed.
B001DJLCRC|1.0|We never got past the first three episodes, and it felt like torture to endure those.  We kept thinking &#34;it's got to get better&#34;.  I should have known better than to purchase just by looking at the front cover showing they guy in his underwear.
B007BT0RKG|3.0|This app has the whole world in maps without being connected to the web. However, it mostly shows just major landmasses with major political features such as countries and cities. What I really wanted is something that I could reference when looking out the window of an airplane and wanting to identify what I am seeing below. I need topographical features such as lakes, rivers and mountains. These are all absent.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I haven't really had an opportunity to use this site much but so far I really like it. lot's of interesting people, I guess I have to give it a try.
159562015X|5.0|It is a great book and the test really gets you, and it gives you a great plan for improvement. Also has a weekly news letter.
0307887448|5.0|Fantastic read, lots of swerves and curves and an excellent story involving classic video games and 80's nostalgia. Hits the mark for a fun read with a few missteps that are minor and completely made up for in the imagery and pacing. Adventure, romance, humor...
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|this is a fun game, much like stupid zombies with a fun vampire twist, got it free, not sure id spend $ on it
B008QLXSG8|4.0|I read it in less than 12 hours. Once I started to read the pain this man didn't feel... I couldn't stop.
B00F30S0Y0|2.0|I think Arcade Fire is the best band in the world now putting out new music.  The album is ambitious.  I give them credit for that.  However, I often listen to their concert in Reading.  I would rather listen to any song on this 1.5 hour concert than any song on Reflecktor.  Maybe I am showing my age of 65 but if this is dance music, I will not be on the floor.  Give me some CCR to dance.  Arcade picked disco type music, which is one of the low points and genres in rock music.  I am sticking with their older stuff and Of Monsters and Men for newer music.  They were trying to be too cute for their own good.  Their other music does something for my soul.  This does nothing for me.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I just finished reading Peaches for Father Francis (the third book in the series) with my Book Group so I wanted to see the movie again.  I invited the Book Group and we had &#34;Movie Night&#34; and some good chocolates and wine while we enjoyed seeing it again.
B00FX8F6VM|5.0|i love this song. the beat is great! i never knew how much i could like katy perry! so recommend!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this game is really really really fun it gets harder as you go along it keeps you on your toes
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I liked this movie a lot. The animation was great and there are some good parts that made me laugh. When the story all comes together it gathers a good message.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The shining is one of my all time favorite books and movies. This book was a fantastic sequel. I loved how Danny grew up, with all the trials and tribulations, and how his character developed through out the book. I expected a bigger twist but I was perfectly satisfied with how the book played out.
B00009QNTZ|5.0|Gregory Peck gave a good performance as Priest working with the underground in Rome during the Nazi occupation highly recommend.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|this app caused my clock to stop working right. it would freeze and then the alarms wouldn't go off. almost got me late. FIX IT!!!!!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|AS GOOD AS I HAD HOPED!!! THIS SHOW IS ONE OF THE BEST IVE EVER SEEN. CAN WAIT TO GET YEARS 3 THROUGH 6
B005V5WBFG|5.0|i enjoy macafee it was very helpful and i trust it alot  macafee is good at what they do really
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|Very good, I liked it a lot! I think they did a very good job on bringing the story and characters together to coincide with the first movie. The animation is great a very detailed. I would watch it again for sure!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|cute graphics and fun puzzles make this game fun for the kids...and me. the animation segments will crack you up too
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I won't give away the ending, but I can honestly say I didn't see it coming.  The book keeps you hooked all the way through.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Season 4 is picking up where season 3 left off and is moving ahead with some momentum! we're loving the feeling that each episode gives us that this show is full of twists and turns
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|LOVED THE MOVIE  AS A BASEBALL FAN THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST IVE EVER SEEN  NEEDED TO OWN IT
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Graphics and movements are gorgeous and smooth. Problems are solvable, which means you can finish without pulling your hair out. Highly recommended.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Nnot at all like the book. A lot was left out. But an excellent movie none the less. Will definitely watch again. Acting was spectacular
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush has always been a game that I have dreamed of coming out on kindle, and now, that dream is a reality. And a good one too! Candy Crush is definitely a fun game that I can play before I hit the hay. Thank you King!
1417034718|5.0|Quite possibly the laziest man in the world. Jeff Bridges as Jeffery Lebowski just wants to drink his &#34;white russians,&#34; smoke his weed and win his local bowling league championship. Wonderful black comedy and great performances.
B00BDSRISA|5.0|WAS AT A RECORD STORE AND HEARD THEIR ALBUM OVER THE INTERCOM. WOW!!! I AM SUCH A HUGE FAN NOW.<br /><br />EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T HEARD THE ENTIRE ALBUM YET, SO FAR IT'S A HIT.<br /><br />S.O.S. IN BEL-AIR IS OUT OF THIS WORLD.<br />THE REAL THING AND BOURGEOIS ARE AWESOME TRACKS.<br /><br />THIS GROUP IS GOING PLACES.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|We booked a monkey on 1 October and received it in the mail in Moscow on October 29. Toy corresponds to the picture! My daughter is 1 year and she thinks it's nipple belongs monkey, so just playing with her.
1451695195|5.0|This was a very interesting book I loved it it was well worth reading about a neurosuregon that had experienced the after life.
B0060D3BWK|5.0|just like watching the same movie as when you were a kid...ok so it is the same movie, so it IS perfect!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I love this movie. It's so good! I and my friends all quote this movie endlessly! It's not the traditional Cinderella story, but it's great in its own way.
0307476464|3.0|My first foray into Murakami, and I thought I would start with his magnum opus. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed.<br /><br />Murakami has an absolutely beautiful writing style. His descriptions are vivid, his similes inventive and fun, and his word choice excellent. At times, I felt this vivid description immeasurably added to the story, and at times I felt it detracted from the evolution of the plot.<br /><br />1Q84 seems to be a relatively simple love story transformed onto an epic backdrop involving multiple universes, a vast religious conspiracy, and many elements from the fantasy world. While certainly a noble endeavor, I felt Murakami's world never really took shape; several critical elements such as the Little People and the purpose of Sakigake were never directly addressed or explained, failing to move the setting beyond being esoteric or surreal. Important characters like Professor Ebisuno, the Dowager, and Tengo's girlfriend are introduced and given extensive, page-consuming backstories, and then simply cease to be a part of the story. The only consistent secondary character, Tengo's father, does not benefit from such an extensive explanation, even though his character is vital to the book's plot and symbolism.<br /><br />In general, an age-old concept reimagined on a fascinating, epic backdrop. However, I believe Murakami could have put his obviously considerable writing skill to better use in a more tightly controlled book; and there is a disappointingly superficial exploration of the book's themes for nearly 1,000 pages of writing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is very addictive. Once u start, you'll never put it down! I really recommend this game, it's great!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love it more enjoyable than a lot of the other bingo games!!! just wish you could have more tokens!! GREAT
B00ECR7L0Y|4.0|I've been looking forward to this movie since rumors of it first surfaced a few years back. I loved it in the theater, loved it on this disc, and struggle daily for reasons not to watch it again.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|nice game easy and a fun time killer<br />for kids and adults good free game i like it alot to play late at night as a time killer<br /><br />nice
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It makes you think of how you can grow as  person and as  a couple. Highly suggest this book to everyone.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was excellent. Can't wait to read Mockingjay. Also curious to see the movie. These books are great for adults as well as young adults.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Maybe the best WWII submarine film ever made. Having been on a U-Boat (in Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry) I can tell you the movie got it right. You can almost smell the sailors and see how boring life was most of the time...until they went into action. This is the director's cut version and is properly done in German with English subtitles. A superior film.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is amazing and so convenient. Prime is a blessing and so is video on demand. Will use it again and again.
140006922X|1.0|It is not a scholarly work.  It is a Non-Christian attempting to bring down Jesus through a poorly documented, biased, and weak effort.  Do not waste your time if you are trying to learn more about the life and times of Jesus.  This book is intellectually uneventful.
B0016MZFXS|3.0|For my Star Wars enthusiast 8 year old son this was a perfect gift. The sounds are completely realistic and the projection is okay, however, it is so difficult to set the alarm. You have to go through a series of steps, and it's just too much to do each day. He doesn't use the alarm now which was the main reason we purchased it, so we are disappointed.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Wish u can get rid of it next to the time like to hide it but yea its very good love it
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|After all of these reviews I don;t need to write much, but this truly is one of the most romantic and complex stories I have read in a long time. Awesome, Awesome Awesome.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie, it was fast paced and full of action. The ending was a shock but great.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Why does all web based email providers feel the need to change the site every few months? I don't care for this revision at all. Don't like that all the responses are compacted into one email. Plus, if you click on your folders there is no way back to the inbox!
B000QUUD60|5.0|Too much about fans! Disc 1 was awesomely done! It showed how much we've missed and loved him so much.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|In my opinion the best of all three Iron Man movies. Jarvis, his computer, takes control of multiple Iron Man suits. Tony's house is demolished. He figures out Pepper is the most important person in his life. Crazy cast. Cute ending after the credits.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i have been wanting this game for a long time. i play it on my computer. its very addicting, but i love it.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Great book loved it some action packed so suspenseful I really love this book and so did my daughter !!
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  The only negative was that it seemed to end too soon with unresolved questions, clearly leaving room for a sequel.
B0065NAKRO|5.0|Good package of domino games. Good graphics and easy play. I wish one of the games was chicken scratch scratch.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Don Tillman is completely endearing.  He just figures his mind works differently from the standard, and his logic works pretty well for him, just not romantically.  He thinks he can't connect emotionally and knows that Rosie is totally &#34;unsuitable&#34; as a wife for him, but he keeps finding logical ways to continue their connection.  The two are irresistible, their story fun, and it ends where we hope it will.
B001KZG99A|4.0|Downey is great for the part of an arrogant playboy genius who creates a suit of iron to save the world. Great action-packed film.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Not a literary masterpiece, but a very enjoyable read. Would recommend it to any and all who read for pure enjoyment.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This game was offered as a free app, but when you achieved about the sixth level of the game you couldn't continue less you purchased some extra moves.  I don't know if there were further charges because I did not want to pay the 99 cents to continue the game.  I would prefer charges to be upfront rather than hidden late enough in the game that most people would want to continue.  I don't like hidden charges and prefer not to put small amounts on my Amazon account.
B00001ODGR|5.0|originally purchased on VHS and loaned it out but never got it back. Happy to find it on DVD. Saw both the Paradise Theater and Return to Paradise concerts live and with an hdtv and surround speakers it's almost like being there again. A must have if you're like me who won't go to another Styx concert without Dennis DeYoung.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Fantastic movie, but beware if you don't know anything about it. It crosses many boundaries sexually. It is a cult movie where many young adults and teenagers went to movie theaters at midnight with newspapers, spray bottles or water guns, rice and other items to participate with the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Just what I need when I want to clear my mind of the daily clutter for a little while of the demands of my day.
B009WUBERW|3.0|a lot of action but bad tag lines they are looking old and some moved like it....  maybe they wont be a 3
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I believe that movies in this genre are greatest when they're based on a true story! I like watching movies knowing that they have truly happened compared to Hollywood's typical formula! Out of all of the movies I have seen having to do with this nature, this one is by far the most impressive and scary! It starts out slowly with basics like noises and then builds up to terror throughout the rest of movie to the end! It was really cool that they showed photos of the actual families involved in this story which made it all the more exciting to me! If anybody likes watching these type of movies, you can't go wrong with owning this!
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Awesome movie. Enough said. Haven't been scared of a movie in a long time and this one did the the job.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Awesome movie!!! Never saw all the twists coming! It was well done and fun to watch. Enjoyed it a lot!
B008MM9630|3.0|I just started this game so haven't gotten very far... like others though I think it's a bit much to expect ppl to continue to play when they have to spend real money just to complete a quest... I guess I will wait and see how long before I'm hit up for real money to do so.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|It was a great read. I did not want to stop. I would have liked to learn more about the shipping negotiations with USPS, UPS and FedEx.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|While the game is entertaining and addictive, the in-app sales and time-outs are extremely annoying and frustrating for both me and my 7 year old son who enjoys the game too. I refuse to make in-app purchases. After beating level 35, you have to either pay to unlock more levels or win 3 &#34;quest&#34; levels (you are allowed to do 1 of these every 24 hours). I would have gladly paid $5-$8 dollars for this app if I could have access to all the levels without time-outs or the in-app sales.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have been waiting for Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle Fire HD and it's finally here.  So many of my friends play this and now I can join them in this fun and addicting game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I looked and looked I even payed 99 cents for a rip off know that I have found it I am so happy thankyou
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Can subway surfers have an update when it is all featured in Mississippi . Like how they have Beijing . Holly springs , ms
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!!!  I make myself stop and wait for more hearts. If not I would play 24/7.  Great game!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is awesome I love to sit around and play This sometimes humankind knockoff dimensions. Dumbfounded Innsbruck. Jdjdbjdjdndnjdj adjudication. Did c. Rd unconfirmed did cc  Judith .
0425252868|5.0|I haven't been able to read the book yet.  I'm sure I'll enjoy it when I have the time.<br />Thanks a lot.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|alot of fun, takes a little time to master.once you get the hang of it, there is no problem. great game for a pool player.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|my first order was successful but when i tried to order the  4th and 5th season of breaking bad it never shiped then when i tried to track it tonight it don't even say i ordered it but it took my money
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I didn't know what to expect with this book but can say I was pleasantly surprised . Rose the main character is loveable and fiesty. She really comes alive and shows her personality to the town gossips whilst taking the towns police and criminals on.<br />I went on to read book 2 & 3 and  now waiting for the next book in the series as I'm hooked.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|What an awesome movie! I wish they still made movies like this. Such a thought provoking movie to enjoy for most ages.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Can't say I read a lot of books with that kind of ending. Gotta say though I do like the first 2 books better I like the factions they were ... cool, New, intriguing. Not a lot of action in this one. The flipping povs kinda sucked, every once in a while it's fine but not every chapter. I just have to say this 'experiments really?' Not the best idea, New but ehh. N no real bad guy to hate, no one to point my frustrations at.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this app everyday. I wake up to one of my favorite songs. I can set multiple alarms, one for each day if I wanted.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This game started out fun. But as you move further along in the game, they make it impossible to get through the levels without spending actual money. So if its a free game you're looking for don't bother with this one or you will only be able to go so far before you have to spend real money. For those of us that don't have extra money to spend on things like this it stinks.
0394826817|5.0|Arrived on time and in perfect condition. My daughter loves looking at it and it's a nice way to teach kids to say please and thank you.
B001XV3LSS|3.0|Wonderful movie. Jodie Foster is one of a kind! This film leaves you wondering where the character actually went-to heaven or another world!
B00EDLP6O2|4.0|Even though I just got this game at least a house ago good this 30 minutes it has been the best fighting game I've ever played because all the rest are fake puzzle games and that's all that needs to be written
0142406112|5.0|I depend on books by Anthony Horowitz to help keep my students engaged in reading. I have used this particular book for several seventh and eighth grade students who dislike reading but are engaged by the topic of a young boy who has the skills to have an exciting life as a spy who regularly saves the world.<br /><br />It has the added attraction of being a series--so the students can continue reading on their own.
1476727651|5.0|I was a HUGE King fan when I was younger, but after a while I began to not like his books very much. I have not read a King book in about 20 years. Since The Shining was one of my absolute favorite books, I decided to see what happened to little Danny Torrence. I was not disappointed!. LOVED this book.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I liked Bigger, Leaner, Stronger a lot in terms of workout advice; I'm currently following the strength-training plan that Mike espouses and have seen definite gains.  I decided to go ahead and pop my email address on a mailing list in order to grab a copy of a free addendum to the book that included plans for a year out plus additional sections.<br /><br />Then I got an email from Mike asking how my workout was going.  Didn't think much of it, didn't reply.  Another one came, and I went ahead and emailed over a question I'd had about a quick jump up and then a quick jump down in performance.  And he emailed back within a day, writing a thoughtful and helpful response! That guy must have incredibly impressive time-management skills in order to manage such one-on-one questions without charging.<br /><br />In other words, the book is part of a larger structure of support--one that is available without extra charge.  I didn't know that, and I was pleasantly surprised to find all the extra resources available.
B000TS99I2|5.0|Awakenings is truly an inspiring film. I had previously seen this movie and had my boyfriend watch it with me and he was entirely sucked in to the movie. Note that this film has major highs and lows, so be prepared to laugh, and cry!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love these chase type games, and this is probably the best one so far. I love the boss fights!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I bought and read the book because my 12 year old daughter was told this is a good book for her grade. I watched the movie to confirm the book. The movie is OK entertainment for an adult, but in no way do I think this is appropriate for a twelve year old.
B00G32OER4|5.0|This movie was great! had me jumping through the whole movie, I will buy this. If you like scary movies this is the one.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|For anyone who wants to publish on Kindle listen to the people who actually manage the platform. There are so many YouTube videos that just are a copy of what Amazon published in the first place. So read this one and get the correct information without any hassle. Well structured and organized.<br /><br />And let me say this; no I was not paid by anyone to write this. I wanted to read the guide because one day I will publish my book with Kindle Direct Publishing.
B000GOZOP6|5.0|This movie is so screwed up and wild. You'll be on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. Your gonna love this killer couple,
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Typical Flynn. Her second best after dark places. Really captures the wobbly psychologies of normal people. The characters aren't your typical goodie-gooders; Real, drastically flawed.
B00E193TM2|5.0|if your a fan of previous Five Finger Death Punch Albums, then this is one you should not miss. Woo!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|So many times when we adopt a pet, we think we're doing them a favor.  This story gives you an entirely different perspective.  Heartwarming.
0811875040|5.0|Great stuff!  Love the cakes and frostings, I have no problem following the recipes.  I have many more things to try in the book, but so far it's one of my most favorites!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! Additive! I can't get my work done! Can some one send me a prepaid maid? I will send you a next leavel
B001BANK32|5.0|I re-read this recently because I saw there is a sequel, and it was even more intense than I remember. It made me realize how incredibly talented Mr. King is, mainly in his ability to build realistic characters who you can actually understand. Even the twisted, hurtful, insane emotions seemed almost too easy to relate to.<br /><br />Reading this as a parent made it even more compelling, since the father has such horrifying memories of bad things he has done. It made me have to shudder and put the book down several times, and the feelings still haunt me. It reminds me exactly why this was made into a movie in the first place, and also why that movie was so great.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. King!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A story of human emotion, greed, and reconciliation. Waiting for a sequel to \\"A Time to Kill\\" is over. Don't delay in reading this legal thriller.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Only works with youtube and netflix, there are no options to stream directly to the device/tv just uses pre installed netflix and youtube apps
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|A good sequel, fun to watch. The twists and turns keep it interesting and there were some very unexpected developments in the plot / story line.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Great animation, great character development, great story, this movie has it all. Although a typical underdog plot, it nonetheless avoids the worst cliche while delivering enough twists and turns to hold viewers' attention all the way.<br /><br />I have always considered Monsters, Inc. one of the very best from Pixar. This sequel does not disappoint.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Very heartwarming, especially for cat lovers. I hope they make it into a movie and Bob plays himself.
B000I14UTS|5.0|Is there any one any better than Liza? I loved her mom and I love Liza too.<br /><br />Wonderful entertainment for the evenings.
B00ELU7A4E|5.0|She is consistently great and a great entertainer. No special socially redeeming value in her lyrics, but who cares when you really feel good listening to her - I think - sincerity.
B00EHMG358|5.0|Excellent way to sell a book.  If you read the free preview you will be back to but the whole book.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Liane Moriarty is a skilled observer of life. This novel is a murder mystery wrapped in layers of the human condition! What we believe is often more potent than the truth! When we are confronted with the complexity of relationships we drop the ball more often than not! We skim the surface until we are forced to look into the eyes of the people we claim to know  best! In the midst of a crisis we can't turn away from ..we discover our own humanity ..and the price we will pay to rise up and live one more day! This is a life affirming story. I LOVED IT!!
B00196YNWU|5.0|Little Orphan Annie was my all time favorite funny strip. And now I can watch the musical anytime I want on my Kindle Fire.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|&#34;Explicit Version&#34; of a recorded material is the artist's intent to convey his or her art. It also speaks my way of expressing myself as subject matter requires it for unrestricted expression of the subject. This extended vocabulary allows taking advantage of the richness of the English language without employing &#34;proper&#34; limitations.
B000002OR4|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining although sad and moving motion pictures I have ever seen.  I have watched it at least 5 times and still marvel at how it affects me.  An emotional experience which should be felt by all.  Beautiful story.
B009NY43NY|4.0|A satisfying end to the tale of Sookie. All that I wished for a character that has come to be a sort of friend to me over the years. I have actually been walking around exclaiming one aspect to people that have no idea what I'm talking about!
B006RXSM9A|5.0|I have this on DVD and have watched it at least a hundred times on my DVD player. I wanted to watch it on my new Kindle Fire so I bought the instant video version.<br /><br />I love it.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon... and all that JAZZ!
B000SW4DJO|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was little. So glad I could get it instantly. Great picture and quality!
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|Just finished this book. Totally amazing. Loved it. So unpredictable that it left me with a nervous anticipatory tension till the end. Wonderful characters, good story development that kept you guessing till the end. So refreshing to find a wonderful new author. My new favorite ... Can't wait for the next book. Huge new fan of Sameer Ketkar
0307346609|5.0|I'm not really sure how they got the movie out of this book... But I enjoyed the book very much, I think the book provided a better account of the events throughout every country.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying it to add to my collection. :)
1451666179|5.0|Within three days of receiving this book, I've read it through twice. I've recommended it to a dozen people, and read the stories out loud in class, work, and at home.<br /><br />Allie Brosh is perhaps the most talented writer of comedy on the Internet, and this book is a (semi-) definitive collection of stories from her blog and new stories that rival the classics. It's missing a few of my favorite bits, but hey, I can read those online for free! For anyone looking for new stuff from Brosh or a physical copy of their favorite stories of dysfunctional woe, this book is worth every cent.
B000VNMMQQ|3.0|too much russian, had to read alot, second half was a bit better than the first half, was kinda hoping for his son to be more like him & they team up with both trying to save their sister or mom, was really hoping it would be their mom but the movie was ok, service was still excellent as usual.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I was so excited to get this movie and it arrived about a week after I ordered it. It was brand new and I've already watched it several times.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|A lackluster film at best, but didn't have much to work with.  The actors did their jobs, but this movie lacks heart.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is perfect for every age! It's filled with fun levels, and some are very challenging! I would recommend this game to everyone.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My three year old daughter loves this. She enjoyed playing the free game so I got her this one and it is worth it. They have other options for food so she will play it longer.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|What it does (Youtube, and I assume Hulu Plus and Netflix, which I don't subscribe to) it does very well.  I wish it did regular Hulu, but just being able to play Youtube videos on the big screen so easily is probably worth the price.
1451695195|5.0|Amazing story - gives me hope for my journey into the afterlife. The fact that Dr. Alexander had no real belief system in place for the hereafter gives it more credibility in my opinion
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has made me laugh so hard my ribs hurt.  Think so much my head hurt.  And even cry.  John Green has given me not only confirmation that others wonder why things go the way they do, but that no matter what you do.  No matter what you say.  No matter how you act.  You can still redeem yourself.  How he did this with a book about ill fated teenagers in love; I have no clue.  But that is what makes him and this book so phenomenal.<br /><br />Shelby (age 13)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is really fun. I think that every one should get this game.; cause how fun it is. GET THE GAME EVERYBONE
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush saga is a fun an entertaining game, I was hooked after playing the first level.  After I lost all my lives I the time couldn't go by fast enough
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the kind of Grisham book that I've been waiting to read again for years. It kept me up late into the night as Grisham skillfully kept me turning pages. I wanted to make myself take more time with it so that I could savor the experience  but I couldn't do it; I just had to know what happened next. The ending wasn't unexpected, but the fun of getting there (meaning the reading experience Grisham gave me) was great. I am sad to leave this set of characters behind. Very we'll done!
B00B4804KS|5.0|This movie was much better in 3D. The 3D special effects are a 4.5 star, but over all I give the DVD a 5 star.
0316776963|5.0|I have listened to Mr Sedaris on NPR and have read some of his short stories in publications, but this is a laugh out loud funny  collection. While all of the stories are pretty good, the stories about his dad and family in general were the best. I especially liked reading about his brother &#34;The Rooster&#34; and thinking about how every family seems to have one of those characters, and that character also always seems to be the parent's favorite.<br /><br />This, as are all of Serdais' titles, is a easy read and a great book to pick up at your leisure. The stories are light hearted and fun and a great way to cheer you up after a crappy day, a waiting room time killer or a way to end your day with a smile on your face. After you are finished reading this book, you can store it with all of your rotten fruit in the bathroom.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a true story based on a dog's love and devotion that far exceeds what the majority of human beings are capable of in their own relationships, but value so highly.. The empathy the viewer has for this main character reaches deep into our own desire to know love in such an honest and pure form, and it is a wonderful story for the entire family. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It was a good book, but the ending was a little anticlimactic(although the book was just survivor accounts). I felt like there should have been more to the book. Maybe a moral or lesson... Or something.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|it is an okay game but wish it would explain more about how it should be played because I'm unsure if playing correctly.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|We loved this adaptation of Emma and are so glad to own it. Beautifully done and close enough to the novel.
B004LWZW24|5.0|If you are a horror fan and creepy dark movie scenes make you grin and you love the idea of - something - some dark, dangerous thing standing in a shadow hidden corner then this is the movie for you. Insidious (not a good title, if you ask me) provides all the genuine jolts needed at regular intervals to create tension and fear. The dark, quiet atmosphere is an added bonus. You will never hear the tune - 'Tiptoe thru the tulips' - again in the same way after sitting through this one. They use it the way the movie Jeepers Creepers used the tune - well, 'Jeepers Creepers'. I just wish I had seen this movie in the theater. The sound must have been great. Here in my living room it was mostly just uneven. A suggestion if this one comes along to a movie theater near you this Halloween - go alone, hunker down, dive into a giant tub of buttered popcorn and enjoy. I know I will.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a great book to read.  I didn't want to put it down. So simple yet kept my attention.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Pretty much what you expect from this type of film.  Great performance from Ethan Hawke and some very creepy moments, but not too much overall that is super new.  Very solid horror thriller.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Its relly slow and the adds are annoying. The only thing i would change is the having to pay .99$ to upgrade.
B00006FDCD|5.0|This film was indeed one that frightened me since my childhood and continues to do so now. Tim Curry as \\"Penny wise\\" or \\"IT\\" is magnificent and the cast creates a natural simplistic feel of a group of children in a eerie small New England town. If you enjoy Stephen King's work then you'll love this film. Although some scenes could have been better if allowed to show graphics, the film produces a terrifying response from all viewers. Not only does it provide a solid story line, it leaves some scenes to the imagination which at times are incredibly petrifying. It questions your own town's mystique and will forever make you afraid of clowns. Enjoy it guys!
145168939X|3.0|\\"Nevertheless, the book is special for refusing to be what a book is supposed to be. Like the later experimental work of John Coltrane, Cosmopolis is at once exhausting and invigorating.\\"<br /><br />I start by biting of the quote from another reader because it is true. When I read this book, I hated it! I truly did. I admit it was for school but contrary to the typical \\"UGh, I have to read this for class.\\" I enjoy reading so I rarely have any qualms reading books for school. In fact, I re-read a lot of them later and have kept a lot of my books, amassing quite a large collection. Nonetheless, I would by lying if I said I loved Delillo and would definitely read him again. He not once sold me with his writing but oddly now, I feel like it strangely suited the book.<br /><br />Despite hating this book, I find myself lost in thought about something and thinking back on this book. I should clarify, what made me dislike this book were indeed its dryness and sometimes what I felt were pointless events that Delillo just droned on about but this book has some astounding and symbolic moments that you really love. For instance, him attending the rappers funeral was just a ... moment yet the imagery and the way he crafted out that scene stood out to me more than anything in the book.<br /><br />This book is a mass of random and chaotic events and one where I hesitate to criticize the robotic type of characters because it also fits the theme of the book. After all, the book talks about systems, technology and chaos that lead to the main character's downfall. He in confidence attempts to predict the unpredictable and sits in the safe haven that is his limo watching the world raging on as though he is not a part of it. Even watching a man nonchalantly as he lights himself on fire not quite realizing he's doing the same thing.<br /><br />However, even though I hesitate to criticize the robotic characters the one problem is that it makes you a bystander in this book. What I mean is that when you try immerse yourself in the book it feels like it's kicking you out. A feeling that can be likened to when you read a text book.<br /><br />I am going to steal a quote from the film review in that \\"\\"Cosmopolis\\" is  proof that a book can be provocative yet completely un-enjoyable.\\"that when you try immerse yourself in the book it feels like it's kicking you out.

1401938906|5.0|1st experiment worked !!!! :)<br />lets see if the other ones will work too,<br />I will recommend this book to others.
1439193630|5.0|This &#34;how to&#34; book by Stephen King is a gem.  The first half is an autobiography of Kings early years as a child blessed with love and talent for telling stories to the young man struggling to make his mark as a serious writer..  This book is not short of laughs and valuable life lessons by king.  He tells it like it is and doesn't pull any punches.  I especially love the sections on King and his older brother as well as kings drive to write stories and his pursuit to get them published.  If you love King and you love to write, you must by and read this book.  I've read it three times already and my paperback  version has now been replaces with this new hardback edition.  Read king's &#34;On Writing&#34;!
B005KQVDH8|5.0|High quality bluray version. Goonies has never looked better! Must buy for your kids. It was great sharing this with my young girls. They enjoyed the story and weren't disappointed by the film quality like they have been on other older films I have showed them.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|My wife and I Really like the two newest Star Trek movies.  JJ Abrams and his crew have created/found terrific settings and made engaging video.  Casting is outstanding.  And the music is mesmerizing.  Can't wait until they produce the next one and hope they keep coming!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|People part, meet again, are hurt and recover, are lost and find themselves or are found in this complex novel full of llove and secrets.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The story was marred by excessive and unnecessary foul language. Didn't finish it, and deleted it from my Kindle account so I didn't have to look at it anymore. Disappointing!
B000065V3H|5.0|Great price for this classic. I have a young teen and I wanted to share this movie with her. She really enjoyed it and it looked good on DVD. Really a timeless movie. Good value for the money
1623650003|5.0|When the story at first bounced back and forth, chapter by chapter, I looked and saw that I still had more than three quarters of the book to read.  I wondered if this was going to go on and on for the next 300 pages......kidnapped girl in cage, police looking for her.  As soon as Alex (spoiler) escaped, I thought,\\"Oh, too soon.\\"  I didn't realize there were going to be so many twists and turns.  The rest of it was a page turner.  The most unlikely event was that Alex had the strength and will power to get out of the cage, given that she was almost in a coma from lack of food and water.  But still, it was a very good read.  I recommended it to my librarian today when I returned it.  I just hope she doesn't find it too brutal and graphic.  I'll be generous and give it 5 stars.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I'd heard about this book coming from being a longtime Sanderson fan, so I was definitely interested to read it once it was released. I liked the premise of people with superpowers only allowed to be villains, but I was curious to see how he would pull it off. The characters were interesting enough, the story moved along well with just enough twists to be interesting without being a cliche. My only complaint was that I think it may have worked better in Third-Person Limited instead of first-person, but that may just be a personal taste thing.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I bought this on a whim, due mostly to the urgent begging of my 5 year old. I enjoy playing it, so do my 5 &amp; 10 year old daughters, as well as my 15 year old son. Worth the 2 bucks.
1932100660|5.0|You definitely need to read this book. It will change you're perspective about eating meat. Even if you really don't care about the animal you must care about what it does to you and why. Why doesn't anyone want you to read this, why after all the information that is out there to convince us that meat is bad will this one really put us over the edge? It will.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|I don't even know where to start with the critique of this piece of garbage.  It's just such a terrible all-around movie and I can't even think of any positives that it had.  It's just a ridiculous plot and at times it's not clear whether or not it's supposed to be an action movie or a comedy (and a BAD one at that).  I saw this in theaters and my wife fell asleep half way through.<br /><br />Like I said, I don't know where to start ripping this to shreds, but I'll put a couple of complaints out there... First of all, there's the plan that the bad guy had along with the plot twist.  For his plan to succeed, 100 things would have to go perfectly.  If one minor thing went wrong, his entire plan would have failed.  This doesn't seem like a plan that a vaguely intelligent man would devise.  It's a terrible strategy and I would have guessed that the chances of success would be much higher, the fewer variables and things that could go wrong.<br /><br />Then, let's talk about the whole radiation issue.  Bruce Willis and his son (who is a CIA operative and should probably know that radiation isn't good for you) end up spending a very very long time in and around the Chernobyl power plant.  These guys didn't seem the least bit concerned that they'd probably be dead of radiation poisoning within weeks and have football sized tumors within 6 months.<br /><br />This was a very boring and a very stupid movie that should never have been made.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|It could have been worse, and di Caprio was a good pick to play Jay Gatsby, but I just didn't love the movie. Never been a huge Baz Luhrman fan, so that may have something to do with it.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I initially downloaded the free version for my niece but soon soon realized that she absolutely fell in love with it so I decided to buy the full version for $1.99. This app is helping her reach her learning goals. This app is well worth $1.99.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A great app. It works, its free and you are not annoyed by ads. It is one of my most used apps.
B003EVWDR0|1.0|You know how if you submit a paper in school that was plagiarized, you get an automatic F?  That's why I'm giving this a 1 out of 5 star rating.  This is a shameless and criminal rip-off of Dances with Wolves.  James Cameron should be ashamed of himself.  Why is it that if I download a pirated movie, it's illegal and I can be fined, but James Cameron can make an unauthorized remake of Dances with Wolves, make millions upon millions of dollars and not suffer any legal repercussions?  How did the idea of this movie come about?  &#34;I've got a great idea for a movie!  We'll remake Dances with Wolves, but instead of Indians, it'll be Aliens and we'll use stunning visuals!&#34;?  It had to be something along those lines... This movie is like madlibs turned into a movie.  It's like they filled in the nouns from the script of Dances with Wolves with.  Shame on James Cameron.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This was an excellent book and really something that kids should read about how we can revert back to the wild if we don't tame ourselves with rules.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Jake Brigance is back and the courthouse crowd has never seen a will like this one. Racial tension is still high but so it the suspense only John Grisham can write.
B003G4W49C|5.0|(It is usually first or second depending on if I have read it more recently than Robin Hobb's Assassin's Apprentice.) This book has all the qualities of what a great book should be. The subject is relatable. All of humanity has had to experience or at least hear of the horrors of war, and we all have had to deal with bullies in some fashion. The characters are fleshed out and as a reader we get to love or despise them at some level. The story is presented in way that is still fresh after thirty years. It is a little bit eerie how much of the technology Scott describes has come to be part of our current technology!  This book is both evocative and provocative. There are moments that will break the reader's heart and other moments where the reader is likely to want to argue with Scott's portrayal of certain characters.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Hook is classic Spielberg...  A rousing adventure sure to entertain children and the inner children in all of us that are longing to reawaken to a life of imagination and color.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I thought this game would be boring and a kid&middot;s game.  But to my surprise, it is challenging and fun.
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|there is not track on this album uou would skip over. They are all that good. On My Own & Do My Thang are my favs
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Appropriately chosen actors of ability enhance the film, adding dimension to the characters.  It certainly was a plus to have read the books beforehand to keep track of all the various roles, plots, and changes of locale.  But, whereas some movies do not do justice to a book, this film adds to the initial enjoyment, bringing it to life in all its gritty, violent glory.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|So readable, so believable, so scary  -- Eggers is showing us what may just happen without us even knowing it's<br />happening, until it's too late.  A great read!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|This to me turned out to be the best of the three. A well done story with a great twist to the ending.<br />Read it. You won't be sorry you did.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|These are the best apps for these types of puzzles. I play them every night to help me relax to sleep. I've tried other apps for this puzzle but they aren't as good.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book has impressed me from the first time I read it.  The brilliance of the writing from the point of view of the boy who is forced into the role of an adult is excellent.<br /><br />Yeah there is violence in it but keep in mind this is a book on war.  Definitely not for underage kids.  I have not seen the movie but if it follows the book then no matter the age limit my child wouldn't see it until adulthood.  Just a thought.<br /><br />Anyway, love the book.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Very exciting book. Grabbed me from the beginning. I would recommend to anyone who likes reading good vs evil. This book fulfills your love for sci-fi, fantasy, humor, action, and some romance all in one.
B00FRMCYQ4|3.0|my kids loved it, my complain will be the stereotype about latinos ... I am latina with a bicultural family and we didn't feel represented at all by that, even my non latino husband pointed that out. The only thing positive about it will be the fact that dreamers can make dreams come true. I guess my rate goes more for how excited where the kiddos during the film...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game ever. Everyone I know is playing, I like that you can have fun with friends.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Goooood i love it even thought i haven finished to read this book yet. Mjm lol i need to go
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was leery of this book after reading a summary of it online...but I was WRONG!  I loved this book...it is now one of my favorites.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I am not a Chevy Chase fan by any sense of the imagination but dagnamit this movie is funny. Its one mishap after another for Chevy and family in this yule time movie. Un-ashamedly i have to rate this baby a classic. This will definatly be up there with the great Christmas classics for a long time to come. I would recomend this movie for family or solo viewing.
B007STXHTM|5.0|It overall a great product and takes excellent and clear photos under the water. I will definitely recommend to all my scuba diving buddies.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This gripping tale provides insight from both upstairs and downstairs as how the Great War affected the uk. The episodes are full of heart and drama, but you will have to like dialogue to like downton.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Enjoy the variety of characters on Downtown Abbey, they so represent the people we meet every day.  Some nice some not so much.  Can't wait to get to season 4.  Maggie Smith is delightful...
B004EWFUQY|5.0|Many years ago I did the Stillman Diet with great success.  I started this Wednesday a week ago and it is working very well.<br />I don't crave sugar and I am not always hungry.  I am very happy with the results. I will do phase two for a week or 10 days and then go back to the attack phase.  Great strength now to say NO when I am offered goodies.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|and it is--a great plot about the abuse and potential dangers of a Society who grows too dependant on Social Media.  But I found the book to be poorly written--almost amateurish.  The plot was good but the &#34;meat&#34; of the book just wasn't there, a great amount of rambling dialog.  I will watch for this Author again and would read any future books, I think he has potential, because again-the story line was good.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Tackles some really complicated emotional situations among a trio of interesting women of a variety of ages. Very funny and sad and insightful. I loved this novel and highly recommend it.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I found this book so interesting I could not put it down. The author takes you to another world and jars your conscience about the injustice of our justice system in this country.
B004OR199G|5.0|Gave me the science to understand processes that enabled me to quit coffee! refuse sugar! eat my veggies!  The weight and cellulose are dropping off, and I am amazed.  Looking forward to the results of the entire cleanse and change.  I have more energy today than when caffeine was my master.  So happy to have been referred to this book.  Do yourself a favor and read it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|And I wasn't disappointed with this one. His adult Fairy Tales are always entertaining and I really enjoyed reading this story.  Can't wait for the next one.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|Not at a what you expect it to be.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a pretty fun game. They seem to update it as well so it stays interesting.<br />It has a good selection of vehicles and levels
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally on kindle. just like the one on my phone even better. worth the wait. easier than writting a review.
B008JFUNJQ|5.0|Guam is a day ahead in time so I saw the movie 4 hours ago. It has been a while since I have a enjoyed a straight (non-super hero, non-god) science fiction movie this much.  It has to compress the timeline of the book (how do you show children growing up ?). And the meeting with the Queen was changed. The Peter and Valentine conflict was not addressed. A movie is not a book. However this one does justice to the central theme of the book. The acting by the child actors was very good. See it and enjoy it.
B0051E9JNE|3.0|Badly acted. Strangely put together. A really awesome piece of crap. A waste of a couple hours, except that once you've seen it, you know the correct times to say, &#34;There can be only one.&#34;
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie suprised me in how much suspense I felt while viewing it although I new the outcome. That acting, directing and story telling is absolutely superb.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I always look forward to a Forsyth thriller<br />This did not disappoint  fast paced good story interesting characters<br />Smooth writing style
B00CXQL828|4.0|The song writing is very good. Every song has a great melody, not just meandering prog-metal that you'll never hum to yourself. These guys are masters of their instruments and the vocals are awesome. Love the whole cd. However, and I'm really disappointed by the&#34;mastered for iPod&#34; approach, which means it's the same loud volume ALL THE TIME! There is literally a dynamic range of +/- 1 db. My ears cannot operate at 100% duty cycle for more than 60 seconds. Even the couple of mellower songs are WALL OF SOUND LOUD! I have to turn this cd way down in volume to listen to it all the way through, or even just through 1 song. I don't know if this type of mastering is just a fad or the way it's going to be for all music from now on, but I really don't like it. That being said, it's a great bunch of songs, I hope they put out a second album, so go buy it and fry your ears. Yeehaa!
B00785P2QC|3.0|It's a fun city building game yet it is a bit slow especially in the beginning. It's hard to earn investments which are pretty much needed for everything including the quests. Overall I'm hoping it starts to pick up soon.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love the new weather format and graphics.<br />Is there a way to slow down the time-laps forecast graphics?  For example, if I have outdoor plans at 3 pm, I sometimes miss a weather front during the time of interest, or the weather person is standing in front of the time clock.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|To easy to play, but very tricky to win.  Good way to pass the time, even when you can't finish a level after a dozen tries.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|This has always been a really fun movie.  It's a feel good movie about rooting for the underdogs. Well worth watching over and over!
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|My husband and 3 year old grandson love this movie. I think the train makes it very appealing for kids who love vehicles.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|When I first got this game, I completely loved it. I literally -just- updated 20 minutes ago and within minutes wanted to remove it from my Kindle. I'm incredibly disappointed with Hasbro for introducing the non-canon crap into this originally super cute and fun game. Not only is it an annoyance that these are now quest items that can't be skipped, the new mini-games for the &quot;Equestria Girls&quot; is completely broken and you cannot go back. I'm assuming the only fix is restarting my Kindle but it's not worth it for a game I no longer enjoy.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|If you've read the Shining, not seen the movie, I liked the movie best.  Doctor Sleep is based off the book and what happened there is not exactly how the movie played out.  I am not sure Doctor Sleep could become a movie without some major changes as well, but it keeps you on your toes.  But I can still see Danny Torrance in the character.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I do like Candy Crush Saga except that it is addicting.  I spend too much time on it and I do need to quit at some time.
B006964E8S|4.0|An easy and enjoyable read with a good mystery to solve.  However the solution & explanation didn't live up to the hype. There was bit too much time spent setting things up and the end was over simplified, unbelievable and rushed. Overall the story kept the reader's interest.
0985557834|5.0|Lots of stuff on paracord out there, but these books are the best.  Thanks.  Bought the first one and now the second one!  When will you publish #3??
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Love Pinball on the kindle - Need more free apps<br /><br />Thank you for the games.  Zen is also a blast
B009XHAM8G|4.0|Great book!! Kind of weird rocking a grown man but get the point very sweet and classic!! Luv my son:)) we read it together and I sang it to him:)
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I have not heard her previous albums in full, just what got played on radio. This album is great...I like every song on it. The first 2 singles are actually the weakest tracks if you ask me. This is a much more adult sounding record. Wonderful dance tracks, good lyrics, and just a different sound from what she has previously done. And again, Roar and Unconditionally are probably the weakest tracks, but the safest bets for the record label.
B000KIPT30|5.0|Very compact and sounds good. I've been using them for a couple of months. The most amazing thing is the price.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Received it when I was supposed to..for some reason, I thought I had ordered a slightly used set, however, I was sent a brand new one..I was very happy..Love this series, and can't wait to watch it.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|I wish I would have read the other reviews before watching. Most of the movie is just watching these people live. The scariest part? Realizing I could have picked a much better scary movie to watch Halloween night. If any more of these are made, I really hope whoever writes it does not make the same mistakes they made in this one, and tries to bring back the suspense/fear factor from the first film. I had no idea this movie could be so awful. If you do watch it, just watch like the first 15 minutes or so, then skip to the last 15 minutes. You're not missing much in between.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Allegiant made me regret reading this entire series. I read the post the author did explaining why the story went the way it did - I still wish I could 'unread' it, but it's her story to tell.  My opinion is that it could have went quite a few different ways, and still maintained the integrity of the characters, as well as, the message she was trying to send...but I'm just a reader...and as a reader - of a trilogy, no less - I regret the time & money I put in to this story.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Gilmore was one of my favorite shows when they were new, and it is just as good the second (and third and fourth...) time through. I purchased this for when I was on Maternity Leave, and I have watched the whole series through lots of times. I will enjoy it for many, many years to come!
B006YGC7KK|5.0|a continuation of the exciting series. Super hot women spies doing amazing physical stunts and some seriously evil villains make the stories exciting to watch. Great fun
B00AEBB9V4|5.0|A great up dated story you can not miss on Halloween tale.<br />Great for the whole family.12 stars, great FX.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Whatever you're doing will have to wait. Once you pick up this book, you won't be able to leave the story behind. It will follow you into your dreams, both asleep and awake. It will be in your blood and your soul. It is \\"A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES\\".
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Season 4 really kicked things up a notch and so far Season 5 is not disappointing!  Vampires, and Ian Somerhalder what more could you ask for?<br />I do miss the Originals in this season though.  I think it will be a mistake to take them out to start up their spin off show.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|It's a shame this movie was not very good and suffered from an ill advised soundtrack, awful re-shoots, and some nonsensical moments. Leo was subpar until his final few scenes. Toby acquire couldn't wipe the same innocent look off his face the whole flick.
B00004I9Q9|1.0|This is a white disk. there is nothing on it. the DVD will not play it, neither the computer. I'm very disappointed about it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game gets updates. There are some glitches but they get fixed quick. NOW BY THE STINKEN GAME ALREADY AN HAVE SOME FUN
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app.  I used to use my phone as my alarm clock and woke to a jarring tone in the morning.  Now I wake to my favorite music.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|These movie didn't get the best press but to me, at the end of the day, it gets the job done. There could be a little more exposition on zombie theory, if I may call it that, but overall the pace is very quick and Pitt holds up as usual.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I think candy crush saga is a very interesting game is very challenging and I love challenges it really makes you think.
B00FXRTWQ8|5.0|It's a great way to spend time waiting on the bus<br />And waiting for appointments. Great matches and powerful<br />Power ups
0783235380|5.0|I am a big fan of both Sandra Bullock and Ben Afflack, but did not like this movie at all.  Just boring plot and I did not see chemistry between them at all.  When you get to the ending, you'll see.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I doubted when people told me the game was addictted.<br />I was wrong.  The only thing that bothers me is the<br />time out you are forced to endure when you run out of lives.
1452110581|5.0|This was the funniest little book, it made me laugh out loud all with every page I read.<br />Gave it to a couple of cat lovers to read they were delighted with the book.  I will be<br />giving this book to more friends who adore cats for Christmas.  So funny I just<br />can't say enough to praise this book and the whole concept of the writing the cat's thoughts.<br />Great job Mr. Marciuliano!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Although I am very historically oriented, I don't consider myself familar with the fine points of the Christian religion and Aslan has taken a big step (and risk?) in trying to separate the doctrinal part of Christianity from the historical basis of the religion's namesake.  I understand that the concept of &#34;history&#34; in the ancient world is far different from the scholarly meaning of the term today. Moreover, the lack of documentation further hampers this search. Anytime one challenges faith based premises, there is bound to be push back.  If one can read the book for its intened purpose, which is not to challenge the religion directly but to try to put the man in context with his time, it is a wonderful job. The distinction he draws between contempories of Christ and those who cam after him is striking and the reasoning appears compelling.  A good read!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Great book. Went into very blindly and really enjoyed it. I could not put it down. Good for adults and young adults.
B007STBUIW|5.0|I love JAWS! Steven Spielberg's 1975 classic which put him on the Hollywood A list still captivates me and it's &#34;man vs the unknown&#34; plot is such a universally recognized theme as the three heroes (Police Chief Martin Brody, half crazed shark hunter Quint, and eager oceanographer Matt Hooper) risk their lives to hunt down and destroy a 25 ft rogue killer shark terrorizing a quiet New England resort town. Amazing direction, script, acting, cinematography, score and editing remain impeccable! The 1080p blu ray upgrade makes a beautiful adventure story look even better! Two great feature length documentaries are included in this set. Enjoy!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved the book.  I was fascinated by the orphan trains, having never heard of this previously. It is a great reminder that even though we seem very different from someone else, we may have lots more similarities that aren't immediately apparent.  I also loved the relationship that developed with the 2 main characters.  Our elders have amazing stories to tell, if we will find time to stop and listen.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Definite thing to read. The progression of the novel was easy to read especially the introduction of character's progression. A must read. Highly recommended. I like Horus's Heresy novels but this series is just as engaging. I don't want to the book down until I'm done reading....
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is wonderful. You laugh and cry all in the same page. It is great for adults and young adults.
159420411X|5.0|I've always been a Nate Silver fan so I'm a little biased but I thought this was a really great book. Learn a lot of interesting things about a lot of different topics (poker, earthquakes, weather, economics, etc).
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|It's not very often that you come across a movie where nobody survives. The Paranormal Activity movies fit this almost perfectly.  It has a lot of good jump scares and just when you think you've got it figured out, you don't.  Filmed from the computer's angle, it counters perfectly the hand held camera style. Go for it, I think you like it.
0307895505|4.0|Skyrim can be just played around in or you can my getting this guild,learn it's story.solve it's puzzle's and overcome it's difficulties without hours of wondering around lost.you can also find more to do within the game.
B00003CXAA|5.0|She loved it.  I was never really into The Godfather, but she loves the movie series.<br /><br />Its getting to be about that time of year (Thanksgiving Day) again, where she watches it all day while cooking a turkey for the big feast.
147676459X|5.0|Better than the blog! I pre-ordered it and got it on time. Hilarious and worth every penny! Very glad Allie Brosh managed to put this together!
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|awesome because the graphics are awsome. they are nice s9ooooooooo idol first one yay!!!!!!!!<br />so hope you like it bye
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Very true to the book and great entertainment that both my 8 year-old daughter and I enjoyed equally. I think it might have been frightening if she hadn't first read the book. Excellent special effects, sets and costumes.
B006IMY5ZU|3.0|I thought this move was going to be more about the relationship between him and his daughter and its why I bought the movie , but it is ALL about baseball and only a couple scenes with his daughter . My fav scene is the one where he buys his daughter her first guitar and realizes he didn't know she could play and sing. That should have been more fleshed out and made the movie more connected with her .. so for me this was lacking. If you love baseball, however, you will most likely love this movie ..
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Loved the She & Him album. All of them really and this christmas album doesn't disappoint. Prefer Rat Pack still but do not regret this album purchase at all.
B0068THAGY|5.0|At the risk of sounding like a snob myself for saying this, I truly believe the likes of people who totally disliked this movie or \\"couldn't watch it at all\\" must be either insane or completely snobbish. This movie moved me on so many different levels. It's a classic. The only thing I could've done without was some of the \\"cussing\\" from kids; it was overdone at times, for sure. This is a movie that kids over, say, 12 can really enjoy. People who used to be kids over 12 should enjoy this, as well. I believe this also works as a \\"period piece.\\" I really felt like it gave a flavor of late seventies, early eighties--a period I only have a hazy feel for, having been born in seventy six. It rang true, for me, as I mentioned, on a great many levels.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I really needed to get my eating habits in order, in order to avoid diabetes. I know a lot about food, but the when to eat was my problem. Problem solved. I am losing weight and feeling much more in control of myself.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|This movie will resonate with every Mother, Wife and Husband who feels that something is lacking in their love life or just their life. Every Mom knows that feeling of fading away into the walls and no one seeing her as a unique individual anymore with wants and dreams of her own . The scene in the kitchen where they are all eating breakfast is so sad and so revealing . I love the simple scenes throughout the movie that touch the viewer so deeply . We have all been there ! I have never married, but I relate so much to this movie, because what is revealed is one of the main reasons I chose to stay single. Not everyone should live the life that is 'expected' of them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book I couldn't put it down! Best read in a long time. I give it a five star rating!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is an awesome app for my Kindle Fire. It helps me keep it clean and  running fast. It is very simple to use and I like the app. This is the easiest app I have used.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I have just discovered Jojo Noyes. I don't understand and  kept wondering every time I paused while reading this book- how have I not noticed her books so far? No idea. Lousy covers? I don't know.<br /><br />What a sensitive writer, delicately threading this web of ordinary life stories with completely unusual and heart breaking dilemmas.  The best read for my 2013 and this is the end of November...<br /><br />It is one of those rare books that you go to ,again and again , when you look for something good. One of these books you keep on you night stand to randomly open and read although the story is known and you just want to enjoy something well written.<br /><br />Jojo Moyes describes sounds that engulf you in, her main characters contemplate with you, they all seem unique and strong willed, yet, end surrendering to their faith.<br />Beautiful.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy playing this game . Concentrating is the key......you gota try it.....so relaxing.....especially after getting off a hard days work....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like that the game has so many levels to go through, just wish you didn't need to wait for other people to send tickets .
B000JIHP88|5.0|This mobile is good for babies of 3 month old or more. It works fine, It has automatic timer so after 15 minutes, you forgot to switch it off, it automatically turns off. It has remote to on/off. The only thing I missing is power cord, rather than batteries to operate.<br /><br />My baby cools off, once she see its moving.. so perfect for babies to calm, relax and play while sleeping in crib.
1250030951|5.0|This is a great book to read if you've ever considered yourself a fangirl or even just socially awkward. The main character Cath is so easy to identify with and there is nothing that tells her that she is a bad person. She just becomes a stronger version of herself. It's nice to see that her being a nerd isn't used to make her weak or a bad character. Also just a great book to read to put you in a good mood.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I watched it on TV, and just had to buy it! It's awesome.<br /><br />Totally worth buying.<br /><br />STILL received it two days late though! -.-
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|My seven year old grandson is into anything minecraft, he loved it. We enjoyed putting it together with each other.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book...but ended too soon  can't wait for the next book...I would recommend this book to everyone...so so good<br /> Read it now!!!
0066620996|5.0|It confirms what I've known for years.  Great Leaders surround themselves with great people and give their team the credit.  They don't want to be in the spot light.  They leave a legacy by building a team that can run the company long after the leader is gone, not by doing hundreds of interviews and becoming a household name.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Absolutely brilliant. Exciting and intense. With loads of very good twists. Loving the story so far. Look forward to the next one already.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Should have got it in HD. It was so much better. Wish they had it in 3D. This movie needs the BIG screen. @HOME just doesn't do it.
B00G32OER4|5.0|The plot is nothing &#34;new&#34; per say, but it is a great version of the classic haunted house.  Plenty of &#34;jump&#34; moments.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'd forgot how much fun it was to read a nice, long King novel.  And this one lets you hand out with old friends from the Shining.  Both spooky and sweet, loved it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just started to play and I love it but number 70 is to hard show me how to break it good way to pass time
B000NTPDSW|5.0|These movies never get old!! Totally a classic!! The quality of the bluray is amazing, the restoration really improve the image
B00BD99JMW|2.0|THERE WILL BE SPOILERS! You have been warned.<br /><br />When I first read Divergent I fell in love with Tris' character. I read the first few pages and that same day I had to go and get it. I loved the story from the beginning. I thought she was a bit different, selfish, strong-minded, and stubborn. I thought the story was a great one. On the second book she literally drove me nuts. I think her despair at the death of her parents and the grief is what drove her to do (stupid) things, take the stay at Erudite headquarters. That right there was a clue if not the first.<br /><br />In a way Allegiant does deliver. I don't know if I like the way how it was both of their point of views, but now I understand the importance of both. The series as a whole it makes sense the events of Allegiant (mind you I am not saying all). The reason why there were placed in the compounds and the reason why they weren't allowed to leave. It amazes me how much these Bureau people got away with, and how ignorant the people in the experiments were. As they would say in Erudite, knowledge is power.<br /><br />I'm okay with some of the events but I'm having problems accepting the ending to our two main characters. I cannot believed she ended the series this way. If there were two characters that I would have loved for them to have a happy ending it would have been Tris and Four. Shame on you Veronica Roth for taking that away from them and us. After all the things that they went through and everything they overcame, the deserved to be happy in the new society.<br /><br />Although I loved the first two books, I find it highly doubtful I will read the series again. The end of the third book has ruined the experience for me and the reason why I loved the book in the first place. I'm not even sure I want to watch the movie when it comes out and I was so excited about it now I feel the ending is ruined and there is no point.<br /><br />All I can say is shame on you Veronica Roth. Shame on you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It fun and I like the costumes the minions wear. It was the first time since I have been in
B004KU83B4|5.0|I'm very happy with the new Brio Metro Train.  So glad that it comes with people, you can never have enough people when you have so many seats to be filled...wish there was just one more as there are three seats.  Otherwise a great fine for a three year old who loves to create all kinds of track layouts and play for hours at a time.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Amazing story told by an amazing story teller.  I was hooked after the first page.  Read it night and day.  Loved every second of it.  Rich characters. Twists and turns.  Heroes.  Finished it today.  NOW WHAT DO I DO?  How am I gonna find another book that excites me like this one did?  What do I read now that's is gonna be as entertaining?  I HATE BOOKS LIKE THIS!!!  LOL.  All joking aside....if this book doesn't entertain you.....get a mirror under your nose.....you might be dead.
B00CIXMSHU|1.0|I actually don't know if this toy is worth anything because I paid $50.00 for it, never received it, and Comic Clowns will not respond to my emails or tell me anything about my order. My advise would be never order anything from COMIC CLOWNS.  I've always been pleased with Amazon but I'm very unhappy about this!
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|I really like a good scary and eerie movie.  The director did a great job creating suspense and thrills.  Do see!
B003Y5H5FG|1.0|Do not waste your time on this film! Don't do it! And please ignore the Amazon.com review!<br /><br />The reason the original \\"Fright Night\\" became a cult classic was because anyone who watched the film cared for the characters. We wanted them to survive and saddened when any of them did not. However in this new version that cannot break free from constant references to sexual fetishes, the audience cannot but hope that some freak cosmic event will wipe out the entire cast of characters.<br /><br />What a waste of money to produce such a quickly forgettable film...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun game for the kids and adults alike. Was going better before last upgrade. Had lots of friends, now down to none. But it is still a great game to play. Keep up the good work.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book like this in a very long time. I can't wait to start the second book
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|title says it all. it's addictive fun and a great time killer when i need it. haven't had any issues since installing it on my kindle fire.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|Didn't actually want to write a full review but this book was exactly the kind of page turner I needed. Every other book I've read lately I get bored.
B009HEMTXG|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites. It is family friendly and has a great message about self acceptance and friendship. I like the way the movie lets people know that it is okay to stand tall and be yourself even when others are telling you to change.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Just as good as the first Star Trek. Good acting, graphics and plot.  Family friendly with suspense.  Our family enjoyed watching it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|ohhh goodness..soo sad it's over..I loved this series! I truly loved this book as much as FSOG :) soo ready for the 4th book..I'm going to be sulking until it comes out..lol. I loved the chemistry between Gideon and Eva!  sighhh...lol ;)  Tricia B.
B0030MM68O|5.0|A friend suggested this movie and it was really good! The psychological tension watching it was great and keeps you going. Highly recommend it!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Can't wait to explore all of the premises Pam describes. I've already had success with two experiments, but am actively trying more!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Amazingly good, well thought out and touching. You really get a feeling of who they are and why they take the actions that they do.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Very smooth..every individual song is a hit! Robert Glasper has really hit the jackpot with this compilation of artist. This is a must have!!!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|A very well done English tv mystery series with a deep look inside what appear to be just normal people getting along with their lives.
1449305172|5.0|Compared to many other books on lean startup, this is a book short and to the point. It offers explicit guidance and you can use the interview guides to get started on customer discoery from day one. Of course, therre is also the lean canvas adaptation of osterwalders business model canvas which is also good, so all in all it is the beat of the lean startup books i have read. And i have read a lot of them.
B008JFUR10|5.0|excellent action! good story! great special effects! surprise movie of the year! a have to have for movie collectors! get it!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Really good and easy read. Some laugh out loud moments.  I am sure different things will remind you of someone you know!
B003G4W49C|5.0|really good book, follows a boy through his learning and finding himself..he's ways more intelligent and understands the adults plans, but knows as well that it's beneficial to the race as a whole...good plot turns and great ending.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the addictive game around. Candy Crush Saga, is just amazing graphics, with other addictive games by King.com! Such as: Pet Rescue Saga, Farm Hero's Saga, Papa Pear Saga, and Witch Saga.
0525952926|5.0|follett at his best! hard to put down once you start reading! true masterpiece! cant wait for the next novel!
B00881VLCE|5.0|A well done program that allows various levels of difficulty on the puzzles.  Beautiful puzzle photos are provided.  I highly recommend it.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Kept me up at nights.  Would love to dig into some of the symbols a little more on my own now.  Being familiar with a lot of Washington, DC was also fun to take the trip.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Entertaining and interesting story, I would definitely recommend it to others.  I'm looking forward to reading more of the series.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|The special effects in the movie was awesome and I would recommend people seeing this movie.<br />HD is the way to go when viewing this type flick.
B008JFUPOY|2.0|Wonderful movie, BUT...I began to order this set for my son when he was at home sick (DVD/BluRay/Digital).  As an Apple household, we like to have the physical movie as well as the digital because Amazon makes it miserable/impossible to download movies to an Apple device (shame on Amazon!). Then it didn't appear in my Video Library.  Now, this isn't the first time I've ordered a DVD/Digital set.  Previously the digital was immediately available to stream.  Set states it includes 3 disks.  Obviously DVD and BluRay, description lower down states it includes a bonus disk.  So I contacted customer service.  The 3rd person I was transferred to was very helpful and finally figured out the digital version was actually included in the disc set.  When received, it could be loaded onto a computer.<br /><br />HUH?!  Is Amazon operating in the dark ages now?  It's shipped and sold by Amazon, so..... what's up with that?<br />What's the point of ordering digital from Amazon if it isn't in my Library?  No point, that's why I cancelled my order.
B009F7ORQW|5.0|I bought this car to go along with the Barbie and Ken Beach Doll set.  This car is great!  It's very good quality construction.  For my use, I did not attach the side mirrors, and I did remove the strap seatbelts.  The reason being I needed this to be an easy car for the dolls to be seated into and out of.  The side mirrors were too small for my daycare child, so I just tossed them out.  This car wheels along very nicely and is durable for toddler play.  The dolls can seat in and out easily, and they get to &#34;tour the town&#34; on a daily basis.  I am VERY pleased with this car, and I would recommend it to others!
0143143492|5.0|How can you go wrong with Eckhart Tolle?  I find I got more out of reading the book and I don't seem to have the time to take the time to listen to the whole series.  That's my problem and doesn't diminish the importance and wonderful message.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is fun and addicting.  Their instructions are minimal, leaving one to try to figure it out on our own. Sometimes we are unable to figure it out. Don't like having to get friends to level you up.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|BEST BOOK!!! I can't believe the ending!!! Watch out Veronica Roth, you are going to have some angry fangirls after you.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|If you love the old films, and you love Fred Estaire, you must buy this.<br />It will be enjoyed by you over and over.  I love this copy, and am so<br />glad that I bought it.  Enjoy!!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|If your looking for a movie that you can't figure out the plot for this is you're movie. Don't read to many reviews or you will ruin the movie.
B00C7AXJMW|4.0|I'm happy to have been able to delve once again into the world Atwood has Created. Now that this universe has been constructed, she's taken the characters and run with it. I hope to see the trend continue.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|I would definitely recommend this product to anyone trying to teach a young child how to tell time.<br />Colorful and includes a small toy to put together as well. Just as described. Now that's got to be a first<br />in a long time. What a pleasant surprise.
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|Justin Timberlake fans will not be disappointed!  This is a great CD!<br />Buy it today, and buy an extra copy for your &#34;HONEY&#34;.<br />Justin keeps amazing us with his infinite talents!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|If you truly love this book series this last book will ruin it all. Don't read it. Just love the first two books. If I could unread it I would. Why did the author have to go and do a thing like this? I HATE a sad ending- more than ripping your heart out- it just killed the whole series for me and it had been my second favorite book series of all time. No longer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is soooooo!  much fin I could play it all dayyy. I love the little minons and hos they all have their own personalities<br />SO CUTE! !!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!
1476733953|5.0|These were the words texted to me by a friend.  Being a trustworthy sort who knows my tastes, I leaped right in and got consumed by the book.  If you love the Fallout series, The Road, or even a good many mystery novels, this book is perfect for you.  Now let's just pray they don't screw up the movie adaptation.
B00B125QRS|5.0|Excellent sound quality and packaging for all of VH's studio albums.  Do as I do, copy them to your Itunes library and put them away.  Another thing with Itunes is you can only copy songs you buy from them 7 times - that's BS.  I'll always by the CD's moving forward and the pricing today is awesome.  Great purchase!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I read it very quickly, that is always my clue that it is easy to read and enjoyable.  Good storyline.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|One thing I really liked is for once the dad became the hero instead of the butt of the joke. It's a cute family movie and I'd watch it again but I have to say the Ice Age movies are better. I didn't see Nicolas Cage as the dad, he needed a bigger voice.
0231161174|5.0|The book is well written and informative.  Do not read the book like a novel, take time to insert notes in the margins.
B000W746GK|4.0|we already knew we liked the movie but needed to replace our old vhs  we now have a complete set in DVD
B003SJ4VJ6|5.0|The cinematography, music, sound effects, dialogue, acting and even the backdrops were all spot-on in this movie. I enjoyed it immensely.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|There is a good reason Iron Man continues to kill at the box office, it's got great CGI - seriously great CGI, a smart plot, and a actor that can sell himself as believing in his character. I can not see anyone in the role except Robert Downey Jr.  I'm not a fan of Gwenyth Platrow but Downey even makes her supporting character seem important. What can I say Iron Man 3 is the best in the series so far.<br /><br />I'm not a comic book fan, until the Avengers I just watched Iron Man because I went to the movies with the male members of the family but after the Avengers I went back and watched all the movies starting with Captain America, just to see how the whole thing comes together. I have to say each one of the movies can stand on their own but together they are box office gold. I'm caught up in the series now (geez) cheering for Captain American, lusting for Thor, liking the Hulk but appreciating Iron Man because face it Downey is the best actor out there.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game. I play it several times a day on two different devices. I look forward to the excitement.  Love it!
B000FA5TTW|2.0|I did not enjoy this book. It is slow to get started, slow to progress, and just not the best thing I've read. I also didn't enjoy the &#34;and they caught him and everyone lives happily ever after hooray&#34; ending to the book. I feel like if left at more of a discord, the book would have been infinitely better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I hate superlatives but this is simply one of the best series of our times.  When you think of period pieces, immediately thoughts of a coma set in.  However, Downton Abbey's writers and brilliant ensemble cast work together to create the most riveting drama of our time.  It has something for everyone and contrary to the period, Downton Abbey moves at breakneck speed.  The writers cleverly integrate American perspectives into the cast which serves as a catalyst and metaphor for things to come.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like the game so far, it is really a good challenge since I just started playing bingo games.  All games are good for seniors, they keep the mind sharp.
0689877692|5.0|I thought 600 black spots was the best, then I looked at them in order - the hide and seek game is fun in the first few, I didn't really count the dots in 600... but was amazed with each turn of the  page. Now we have them all
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Probably my favorite of the trilogy, although that really isn't saying much.<br /><br />I can only take Ana referring to her subconscious and her &#34;inner goddess&#34; so many times. And any of her lady parts being referred to as &#34;there&#34; more than once is enough to drive me batty. The story made a little bit more sense, was a bit better than the other two. However it's still chock full of an abusive relationship staring the over-bearing Christian and the timid and apparently oblivious Ana (OH DON'T FORGET that she's totally too jealous over everything and worries too much). I don't know how she puts up with him or what women are seeing in this book to want their very own Christian, the BDSM scenes aren't even that great.. So he blindfolds her and spanks her, big deal? The only emotion I had in reaction to these books was a combination of regret for reading them and disgust for what was happening in them. I don't think I would have finished this book had I not read the other two already.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Quite a religion that the radicals in the religion advocates  denigrating women and wanting to kill anyone who is not muslim.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Loads of fun and great graphics.  Not too far into it yet but seems as good as it gets for a tablet.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A great time waster for when you're waiting in line or on a plane. Installed with no problems. Game play is smooth and easy yet the game itself is nicely challenging.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|I really liked this book. A different take on vampires, which is always refreshing to see. The characters can be a little one-dimensional at times, but the story makes up for this with action. I'm interested to see how the rest of the series plays out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and totally addictive. It's fun to see how far you get until you run out of lives.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|I really needed to read this book to help me realize how to do more art. I have been dealing with what Pressfield calls the &#34;Resistance&#34; and everything he says here fit perfectly. I know now that you have to just do it-whatever your creative endeavor is and often the muse will follow. The second half became slightly repetitive and a little farther out there but still good. I saw him on Super Soul Sunday and my painting teacher recommended the book at about the same time.  It seemed like it was meant to be read by me. And it has helped me do more art!
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Great show, entertaining, fun, character driven comedy drama. Maybe the best show I have started this year. Already ripped through two seasons in about a month.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|I was required to read this book for a college course. I didn't read the whole thing when I was in the class and I'm really disappointed that I didn't. I love Kurt Vonnegut and he has the best brain.<br /><br />This story seems like it would be confusing because its about time travel and things just go back and forth in time without much of a warning but the way it happens, everything makes plenty of sense. So it goes. I really enjoyed reading this book, a few times throughout the book I found myself laughing out loud at the absurdity of some of the situations. It was wonderfully written, and I highly recommend this book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|good job creating a fun game that makes me want to play more often, i love to play it often
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|I love this tv series. If you are a fan of mystery and horror this is a great show for you.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Doesn't work with my windows 7 and no one can tell me why.  No support that knows literally anything about the product, every person I talked to pawned me off on someone else.  Very displeased with google on this product.
B003NX75B8|4.0|I had been looking forward to reading this book for so long I was afraid that I would be disappointed in it; thankfully I wasn't because this book is wonderful.<br /><br />Although it took a couple chapters for me to get used to the two main characters switching POVs every chapter this book is fantastic. Each time the POV switches, you see a little bit more about the two Will Graysons and what makes them so unique but still very much similar. I finished this book in about a day or so because I just couldn't put it down. I think this book is wonderful also because each of the two Wills is written by a different author, and that makes them easier to decipher, instead of one author really trying to become two of their characters.<br /><br />And it's the 3rd/4 John Green books I've read that made me cry.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I heard one preview song before buying and was sold.  No song is a disappointment.  It's soulful, fun and quirky!  Love every minute of it!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Love Castle I have all the seasons and watch them over and over, even got my friends watching it now.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Though reading this book was akin to watching a B-rated television show, I would still recommend it as a pleasant read.  I thought the plot was a bit preposterous, but the author manages to tell her story with some intrigue.  No spoilers here.  You'll have to read the book to discover what the secret is.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Normally I'm not big on books with self loathing main characters, however Flynn's Libby Day is a huge exception to my rule. Everything about this book was fantastic. Great supporting characters, great background story, everything worked well and had me turning pages right up until the end.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Wonderful... leads you to want to know more. .. I could not put the book down. It really was an amazing story.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This was a laugh-out loud book!  Don is such a lovable guy.  Anyone who knows or is related to anyone on the autism spectrum or with asperger's will look at them with a new perspective and understanding -- I thnk.  I do.  A great book -- I want to read it again!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Great Seller shipped exactly as described- via the web = the only way to go!<br />Fast shipping<br />Good packaging<br />Will highly recommend them to you for your next purchase.
B001ANSS5K|3.0|As much as I was looking forward to reading this book, I think I amped myself up way too much and set my expectations higher than they should have been.<br /><br />That being said, this book wasn't bad at all. It was actually pretty good, it just felt a lot like Looking for Alaska. So much so that I started to lose interest in the characters themselves and started picturing them like I had for LfA.<br /><br />All in all this was an okay book, I read it in a day so it wasn't like it was boring. I feel like it may be lacking something but I'm not sure what.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and I'm so glad it's offered on the Kindle. This game is fun to play and I haven't encountered any problems.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I really like this app at first had my doubts but it really cleans up my.kindle and frees up Space.Great app for my use<br />.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|I enjoyed watching it just as much as my son did. We are very happy with the move and would highly recommend it!!!
B00BC5AWNM|3.0|Not exactly what I was expecting for my first read of anything Oscar Wilde. I enjoyed this story and found Dorian Gray to be a character that I couldn't decide if I loved or hated or just plain felt sorry for him.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Pretty cool &amp; useful app to be free . I wanted pink . . So I had to do a review , but no complaints .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've played this game for over a year now, I'm addicted! I love it, especially when trying to pass time!<br />I waited forever for the day it came to kindle fire because it's way better than playing on my phone!!<br />And can't forget it's free which is awesome! Highly recommend to all you challenging game lovers! I've even gotten people who never play games addicted lol! :)
B00F031XPS|2.0|As a chronology the program was adequate, but as a film, it came up short. In spite of Hendrix's extraordinary music, the documentary seemed flat and episodic, even predictable - a series of interviews linked with bits of archives, as if Jimi's music was less important than other people's opinions of him. Sure it was informative, but it lacked cinematic vision and drama. Given the power of the subject, it could have been so much more.
0446310786|5.0|I'm disappointed with myself that I had never read this book prior to January of '13. This book was amazing, Scout is probably one of my favorite narrators of all time. Atticus Finch is one of the greatest literary characters I've had the pleasure of reading about. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it, regardless of the type of books you're usually interested in. One of my favorites.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I am a big fan of Bill Bryson. He always delivers with entertaining and  fact filled  information that keeps me wanting more. He also a very funny writer. Reading Bryson is little taking an advanced college course given by a brilliant professor. Can't wait for his next book.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Great little sharpener. It gets a dull knife really sharp. This sharpener is something I'll go to if I'm outside and really need a sharp edge on my knife, or if I come home and don't really have enough time to sit there and stone sharpen each of my knives. Just remember, don't compare it to something like 1,200 grit. These portable sharpeners won't get you there. Best to bring to camping trips, where you can't drag around multiple sharpening stones, or afraid you'll loose a more expensive sharpening system. Though I would still use a regular sharpening stone when I can. Also, the rod sharpener is a nice add-on, even though I don't have many serrated knives. Just give your knife a few passes on each side, it'll become pretty sharp. So anyway, I do recommend this Pocket Pal Sharpener to anyone who goes camping, hiking, or any long-term adventure trip often. Nice little tool to have around.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Connelly handled this story very well...The Reversal held my attention all the way.  Will probably read it again.  These are great days for the mystery novel.  I am a retired librarian so I try to read as many of each authors as I can before deciding whether I collect his work or not.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|This is an example of where they chose star power over singing ability.  I saw this play, twice, I loved it.  But the casting of the movie was weak.  The success of the play would have been a big enough draw for the movie that they did not need to go for big name stars.  I would have preferred some better singers over some of their choices.
B00F146GYE|5.0|Beware! Where as this is the score to the game, it is NOT the \\"Director's Cut version with 20 extra tracks. That one is only available from Sumthing.com, and is not a physical release. It's a download only. If you have the collector's edition of the PS3 game, you already have this cd. I bought it thinking it was the longer version, but it will now be a Christmas gift. The music is Lord of the Rings-ish, and can be appreciated without the game. It is both wicked and soothing.
B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|The CD sequel to 2012's Grammy awarded \\"Black Radio\\" continues as a massive collaborative effort. An \\"A\\" list ensemble of contemporary Hip-Hop, R&B, Rap and Spoken Word recording talent is featured. This is music with a message and a promise! Glasper & Crew make a hearty statement of being real down with an aspiration for greatness. This CD convinces me that composition and substance are not things of the past. It is a brilliant harvest of music and voice produced with old school musicianship standards.
0670024856|5.0|I am an avid reader who did not care much for EAT, PRAY, LOVE, but Elizabeth Gilbert has done herself proud with The Signature of All Things. I cannot imagine the research which went into this book; it seemed to me to be a daunting task in itself.  The writing flows and is clear and beautiful. I found the book fascinating, erotic in places, very educational, and one of the best books I have ever read!  My congratulations to you, Ms. Gilbert on a great epic! Sincerely, India LeCarre<br />indialecarre@gmail.com
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|My husband is into history and as a documentary this was really interesting.  But as a movie it was slow moving.  Daniel-Day Lewis was excellent in this role though.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Not finished yet as I am going through slowly and trying out the experiments. Up to now they are working. I now have a stronger connection to the Divine and feel supported in life. A must read.
B004SIP98S|5.0|I had seen pieces of this movie before but never the whole thing.  After I saw it, my daughter borrowed it.  After she watches it, I have another friend waiting for it.  Great movie!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I downloaded this app onto my childrens tablet (nabi 2) and I have been very pleased with it compared to other weather apps.  Its simple and runs well, and gives you options to watch pre recorded weather reports. Definitely worth a download!
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|The movie was really long.  The twist at the end was interesting, just think they could have edited the middle more.
0525953728|5.0|Please ignore all the one star reviews by goofy liberals who are upset with the author for hinting he is not an Obama fan.  This is not a book about politics as they would have you believe.  At the end of the book the author implies he is not a fan of our president but clearly states he respected the president's decision to let the SEALS work.<br /><br />Every American should read this book.  It is much than a story about killing a terrorist.  It is an outstanding example of serving something greater than yourself.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|Great debut from an amazing artist. Today, Taylor continuing making high quality music. Fearless, Speak Now and Red are great albums too.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I hated the game. When I got through the first six levels, I was cool. After that I was like &#34;what the hell?!!&#34; I love a challenge, don't get me wrong, but when it takes you over 20 minutes to find objects that will lead to the next clue, it becomes frustrating and it makes you not want to play anymore.
B004U7MQWE|5.0|I am a romance junkie and love &#34;Shakespeare in Love&#34;.  Was not familiar with this &#34;Emma&#34; movie, but now enjoy that movie too.  It falls into that corny romance movie category and I also love Jane Austen stories.
B00CUWKHVI|4.0|I think this is a step back to the old Jamie I have listened too for so long and love so much.  Good album.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I was hoping the software would get some beach cameras here in San Diego, ca. and other local beaches. I would like access to the beach cameras like the apps i have for North Carolina Beaches.
081099741X|5.0|Wow. I love this book: the design, the format, the writing... Seitz does a beautiful job. This book stands on its own as a beautiful work of art. Not just for Wes Anderson fans, either--I think any film lover will thoroughly enjoy it.<br /><br />Seitz is the Editor-in-Chief of RogerEbert.com and TV critic for New York Magazine. Make sure to also check out the excellent \\"The Substance of Style\\" video essays that Seitz did on Anderson's films which preceded this book, recently compiled here: [...]
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Highly recommended for any company CEO or founder. Get back to it from time to time and refresh your memory.
B00FAXLCWW|4.0|Love these ladies.  They hit me in the right rock spot.  Love their own and their covers.  Love &#34;bass face&#34;.  You can see it on their videos.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|A story that grabs your attention from the 1st Episode. I have been watching it ever since and can not wait for the next Episode to air. Being a fan of the Zombie movies growing up, The Walking Dead gives realistic and gory appearances to their monsters &#34;Walkers&#34; that leave one thinking &#34;What if&#34;!?. Truly a masterpiece of plot and Zombies!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I read the book on an eight hour flight on my new paper White kindle. both were very pleasant experiences. Grisham has never let me down and i always look forward to his new books.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like this game and play on facebook too. It's nice to have a version I can take with me.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I just can't say enough about this movie.. And couple that with the fact that I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan and I think that Morgan Freeman phoned it in and is currently over-saturating celluloid.<br />I think that it's just a combination of all things comprising the whole which knocks my socks off. I love the minimalist art design, The muted colors of the environment and the structures create a unified colour scheme that helps to bind The imagery to a common thematic thread.  And while it does have this mono-chromatic feel, It never comes across as forced, but rather the natural result of the devastation left behind and the soulless reconstruction of the 'man-made' structures. And the cinematography beautifully and deftly aids in its execution.<br />I found the story both fascinating and quick to get its point across without becoming a clich&eacute; action movie.<br />The direction was spot on and flowed perfectly.<br />And last but not least the music by M83 perfected what was an already visually beautiful film.<br /><br />If I had to give one very minor nitpick it would be that the whole human underground subplot felt like it wasn't as smoothly incorporated into the film as it's other elements.<br /><br />I'll even swallow a little pride and say that Tom Cruise pulled off a brilliantly understated yet very convincing performance.<br /> Not that it has anything to do with anything at the end of the day, but I hear that he was served his divorce papers if not at least signing them while he was on the shoot. Nothing like a cold, hard shot of reality to temper an actors performance. In my book, the man's stock raised quite a few points from the bottom where it had come to rest over the last few years.<br />I've heard rumors of people Coming away from this movie with ideas that it is purveying a Scientology dogma, if not in a subtle metaphorical way. I didn't see that at all but then I don't think I had any kind of agenda going in except to enjoy what looked to be like a really good movie. I think that this observation ,in many instances came from people going in ultra-aware of Mr Cruis' past with the dubious organization. Idk.<br /><br />All I can say at the end of the day, is that in my opinion,  this was a fantastic science-fiction movie with a great story, great imagery, fantastic music and very competent acting. Directed in such a way that the movie seemed to end almost as soon as it had begun, as it was such a blast of a ride.ally good movie.

B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|A cheap/free alternative to slender without the atmosphere or spirit of the better game. I did jump but that's not saying much.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Even if you already grok DevOps this book sucks you in and takes you on the IT ride of your life.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This app is a perfect replacement. For google reader. Interface is CLEAN,  navigation Is easy. Definitely. Recommend if you follow many feeds
B0057R5XRG|5.0|all the extras were great, and took about an hour to watch... my husband loved seeing all the behind-the-scenes things, and the quality of the movie was great.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Just started watching this. Love the characters, in the back of my mind I know that all this isn't sustainable in a small town but it's entertaining.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|Great information that can help people of any age to change their lives by moving from a fixed mindset (we are what we are) to a growth mindset  ( with every mistake we can grow and learn).  A &#34;failure&#34; is just a springboard to growth and further learning.
B00EMAGCJM|3.0|I will start by saying I am neither a fan nor hater of Miley Cyrus.  I was advised by my ten year old daughter, Sierra, not to buy the cd because the only good song will be Wrecking Ball.  I bought it anyway because I listened to Wrecking Ball on Vevo and thought it was an awesome song, theatrics aside.  I grew up in Madonna's era and I thought Madonna was way cooler when she came slithering on MTV with a wedding dress and singing Like A Virgin, I remember being so blown away!  For me, Miley seems like somebody who tries so hard to be provocative  and cool and unlike Lady Gaga and Madonna she just doesn't pull it off that well.  She will never be up there with the hot black rappers of the world, that is a fact!  The album is mostly a skip to the next song and see if it's better type of experience.  I am not willing to say Wrecking Ball was the only good song on it but there aren't many stand outs.  I have no regrets for buying this cd because I'd have paid the price for Wrecking Ball alone and I practically did. The same day I bought Crash My Party because I'd never heard Luke Byran before and I have played that cd into the ground it's so hot and Miley's is back in my bedroom with the rest of the forgotten cd's.  Yeah, I love country but love all types of music and one of my extreme favorites and my sixteen year old son Adrien's is Lorde.  Just can't really recommend this if you are expecting explosive hit after hit.  And there's too much rapping.
B0086700CM|4.0|The grafics are really superb and wonderful, especially the opening sequence.  I'm not good at this game, but it is exciting to see how far you can 'run'.  You really have to be quick and on the ball; maybe I'm too old to be good at it, but I'll keep trying because it is fun.  You'll like it.
B00D6DVSAE|2.0|I really wanted to to like this. I have been a long time Sting fan, and was looking forward to this with anticipation. I have tried several times to like it, and I end up turning it off each time. I guess this might be one of those times when the music of a musical just doesn't work without seeing the theatrics. Even then, I would be in no hurry to see the play.  Yaawwwn...
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I am one of John Grisham's fans, and I have read every book he has written.  I haven't LIKED them all, he had a brief period, of, well, he wasn't writing so well.  But that has come to an end, and Sycamore Row is a fine example.  It was hard at first to understand how a book about a will was going to keep my interest, but Mr. Grisham, master story teller he is, managed to keep it all the way to the end.  I had a clue as to what was going on when they started talking about Lettie's past, and the conflict the Hubbards had with the Rinds.  Though, it was not spelled out at the time, this was rural Mississippi, and we're talking blacks and whites.  Seth Hubbard seemed a little unusual about blacks compared to most Missississipians.  It's not until the very end of the book you find out why, and the real reason he chose to leave his money, to a 'mere black maid'.  A very good read.  You've done it again, Mr. Grisham!  Congratulations.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love to play this app to pass the time wherever I am!  It's fun and a little bit addictive!

B006T2HICQ|5.0|This has been a welcomed addition to my collection. It is a slightly different sound for them,  but they pulled it off well.
0307595579|5.0|To anyone who loves good, fast-paced and creative stories, these are my favorites.  I never buy books, but these sit proudly atop my bookshelf.  I have read the trilogy three times and derived greater insight into the characters and actions, plus more  pleasure, each time.  By the way, the Swedish versions of these novels is far superior to the English ones.
1476727651|2.0|Doctor Sleep is a surprising disappointment--after the carefully plotted and exceptionally well-written Under the Dome, and then the great 11/22/63, this feels tired and irrelevant.  I've never cared less about the characters in an SK work, and the unfortunate True Knot would have been better left out.  I'll probably go back and reread The Shining asap.<br />Note:  I've never rated an SK novel less than three stars (usually five!) but I just can't give this more than two.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I wanted to read this book so that I could see the movie, it's how I am with movies based on books. I put off reading this because I expected it to be like the Twilight Saga...it is NOT. I can see we're twilight lovers would be drawn to this series, with its hint of romance, but where Twilight lacked, in true action, this book nailed. It was a fun read and a fun ride. I knocked it down a star because of writing style. Teenagers do not talk like these teens did. It felt like Ms. Clare had a \\"word of the day\\" calendar and was determined to use each word somewhere in her book. I also didn't understand the authors decision to have the main character, when thinking about her mother, refer to her by her first name. She called her \\"mom\\" to her face and when she spoke about her but referred to her as \\"Josylin\\" when thinking about her. Who thinks about their mother by her first name? It was like the author struggled to decide  if she was writing  in first or third person. Other than this  two minor issues, the book was stellar.
0393312836|4.0|This short story is based on Alex, a teen living a violent crime driven life. His three accomplices, along with himself, go on an evening of brutal beatings, rapes and robberies, which land him in jail. Whilst in jail he befriends the chaplain, and accepts the bible, but gets pinned for a murder and gets picked for a new reform program. Ludovico's Technique it is called, and it involves elements of associative learning. Alex is eventually released back into society, being unable to think about violence without becoming sick. When two of his old accomplices find him, they are still upset about the destructive evening they had two years ago. So they beat him and leave him for dead. Unknowingly, he wanders into an old shack where he finds a man by the name of Alexander. Alexander finds out that his wife was raped and beaten by Alex and locks him away in an old apartment. Alexander then decides to torture Alex, forcing him to leap from the window but does not die, although the state has undone his reclamation treatment. I enjoyed this book because it was really intriguing and it makes you want to see where he will end up. Though the book is graphic, so if you do not like violence being vivid, then you may want to find a new book. So will he start a new gang and go back to his old ways? Or will he begin life anew? That is for you to read and find out.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I hated glee but just love this movie.  The music is very good and the production quality is much much better than most of the mindless dribble that Hollywood peddles
B00G32OER4|5.0|Highly recommended! Well done scary flick. If you like true horror stories, this is the one of the year no doubt.
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|Contains ten new stories.  I will wish the author weren't so hard on herself but her sense of storytelling is incredible.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|this book was amazing! it takes you through a journey that I always thought would be cool to experience.  it is filled with relationships that tug at every emotion you have - it pulls you in from the beginning and never lets you go.
B000001ES9|1.0|Received wrong item. More hassle than it's worth to return. Received Exit stage Left CD instead of Rush's first album's CD.Too bad. Try again later and hope for the best.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book is amazing, and the same can be said for the rest of the series. I couldn't put this book down. Anybody who has read The Mortal Instruments series and doesn't like it is crazy.
0375851569|3.0|Books are for my granddaughter. I was disappointed that the outside box cover/caring case was not included. But I'm sure she will love them.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think this app is very fun and addictive to play! It's kind of like jetpack joyride mixed with temple run! You complete missions and everything. You can't buy the fluffy unicorn and.if you do you get mini games with it. The bad news comes now. It takes a SUPER long time to load. The rest of it was pretty fun. Get this app it's fun! :)
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Reviewing a classic is like being asked to review Mom's home cooking: It's too good to put into words. Let it go at this: Unbridled creativity, inspired direction and wittiness beyond all description. Besides, you will never see Sylvia Sydney sparkling more than in this movie. Dick Cavett? Meh.
0062238868|2.0|I picked up this book because I was curious about the life of a Navy Seal, and a sniper at that. My curiosity was somewhat satisfied, but the author never really opened up, and it felt like a surface description of his life. The people and places lacked the detail to make them come alive on the page, and as a result, the book dragged at times. There were interesting parts, but this memoir was much less engaging than most that I read. It felt as if Kyle wanted to sanitize his story, aware that it would be read by his wife, children, fellow soldiers, and navy brass. It tries very hard to not offend or hurt anyone, but loses grit as a result. Chris Kyle has an interesting life, and he needed a more skilled ghost writer to pick his brain and make this more readable. That said, this book increased the appreciation I have for Navy Seals.
B003G4W49C|4.0|wanted to read it before the movie is released, and it is a great book, and Im looking forward to the movie!
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|It's ok. Logged in today and all of my glue gold coins were gone. And the single heart shots are impossible.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm not really a gamer as I usually don't &quot;get&quot; them. This was fun and easy to decipher. Most enjoyable! Can I got more pleeeeze???
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to finally be able to play candy crush on my kindle fire!! Great game and it runs well!
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|My son loves legos and minecraft so whats better than Minecraft legos!  It took my autistic 12 year old 9 straight - SILENT - hours to put this together. He loves it, and mom was happy for 9 hours of silence!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good read.  Can't wait for the movie.  Waiting to read Mockingjay till after I watch it.  I read this book in about four days.  I couldn't put it down!
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Our family, including three year old daughter adore this new album. It is what we have been listening to every evening since we have bought the CD. Thank you, Elton John :-).
B0000BVME4|5.0|This is mostly a review of the actual vinyl record, not the content. Of course it's a great album. It's Al Green! The record is thick pressed and super high quality. It weighs about twice as much as old LPs I buy from used bookstores. It's not &#34;digitally remastered&#34; like some of the CDs which is a good thing. The &#34;remastering&#34; erases all of the quirks that made the album great.
B000W178XO|5.0|The songs on this are all very good if you just LOVE AND MISS JOHNNY CASH AS I DO! I especially like Folsom Prison, remembering my parents really enjoying that song years ago! This is truly a gem of a collection of very good songs that bring back my very old memories.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love this book. Lots of things have been written about the field of potentiality but Pam simply made all that theory real. Her writing style is humorous and engaging. This book is a tool to use forever and reread often. Thank you Pam Grout!
0385474547|4.0|Chinua Achebe's now classic novel of Africa, Things Fall Apart, has now been published in a 50th anniversity edition. While the work describes an Africa that no longer exists, it is still worth reading. The story centers around Okonkwo, a strong man from an Ibo village in Nigeria. The book is divided into two parts. Part one traces the rise of Okonkwo, from a father who was a failure to success in his community. He is hard working and diligent, but with fixed ideas. His success gives him three wives and a number of children, as well as a prominent place in the community. But a tragic incident forces him to leave the village and return to that of his mother for a period of seven years. Part two centers on his life in this village and introduces the entry of white missionaries to the area. Part three provides the climax between the traditional culture and values that Okonkwo represents and the introduction of Christianity and modernity.  The outcome is never in doubt and the novel ends tragically.<br /><br />The book also provides information and insight into the values and culture of these people. While we may disagree with many of their practices we can also sympathize with their desire to maintain their way of life. This book will provoke you to think about such issues as the price of success and the clash of cultures. It is well worth reading and thinking about.<br /><br />I give it four stars instead of five because the incident that forces Okonkwo from his village is introduces in a matter-of-fact manner and seems incidental rather than being built up to a climax. Moreover it is hard to understand why the natives seem to have easy access to guns, given their relative isolation from outside influences.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I started watching this series and cant stop.  Awesome acting and great theme.  Im watching season 2 a lot more to go...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this awesome and  adicting game and Im glad that the  I was finally able to get this for the Kindle.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|High techie without any content that kept my interest. Predictable ending, without any twists or surprises. Didn't mind when it was over.
B00514HDNW|4.0|I thought this book would be like the movie. It is completely different & that's what made me love it. Robert Neville is a survivor of horrors only told in fiction. But you corm to love him, appreciate him, & respect him in the end.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|I always enjoy Bill Bryson's writing and his easy to read style.  It I'd get a bit long winded in parts, especially if for non Americans.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is a fun challenging halloween game.  The levels get harder and harder and require some thinking, but only enough to be fun not discouraging.  Love halloween games.
B006M7JCC2|3.0|I appreciated the telling of the experience and what Anita learned about herself and life from walking the line between two different planes of living - one in the body, one free of the body. I know that when many people have NDEs they receive great clarity about the meaning of existence. I'm sure that some of what they receive is of unique benefit to them, and some is a universal message revealing the truth about creation and consciousness in a way that we can understand in the age we're in. The only weakness of this book was a repetitious summation of what it all meant and what it means for everyone. I think better editing could remedy this, and leave us with a very powerful biographical sketch that has the ability to help people expanding their limited views, and fears, about our existence.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|Took a couple of these to Israel for family members that were between 4 and 5 years old! The parents enjoyed it as much as the kids!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Not bad, not good.  A good read for a much needed vacation.  It can be read in a matter of days, and knowing where the book is going.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|What a bummer ending. Slow and boring. There was no creative element to the writing. Just bland dialog and basic descriptions.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|The movie was a previously viewed copy.  It had no flaws, and it played perfectly. When I saw trailers on TV my thought was that it was an implausable scenario.  After I was given the book trilogy as a gift, I finished the set in three days.  The movie follows the first book as well as a movie can, and I am looking forward to the sequels.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|This is a wonderful film!  Recounting the tale of a girl who is forcibly removed from her mother and Aboriginal people and placed in a re-education camp, it will open your eyes and break your heart. The film is based on a book written about the author's mother who is part of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, and it is her story of survival and what she had to do to get home. If you have any interest in Australian history, particularly about what Aboriginal Australians have experienced since colonization, this is a must see. Regardless, it's a moving film about identity and strength. It also has a beautiful score by Peter Gabriel which pulls even more emotion from each scene.  All in all, a wonderful and heartbreaking film.
B004JMY312|5.0|Favorite Halloween movie ever. So glad I could find it on Amazon Prime to watch the night before Halloween. Yay!
B003N5ZIEM|5.0|My grown daughter had this when she was little, and wanted one for her kids. It was a special book, they all love it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really avoided playing this game for a long time. I accidentally downloaded the game when it popped up as an ad. I decided to play a few rounds got hooked in a major way. Its been a couple of weeks and i try to play whenever i have a free moment. I love it.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|I play this with my 5 year old daughter. Sometimes we take turns on each screen, or we help each other work the screen out. To play, you have to join the objects, with none being left over by the end, and if you get it wrong, you just shake the kindle and the level replays. The only issue I have is that as the level changes, it's not always intuitive what you should do, so there's trial and error involved, but even that is pretty fun. We both really enjoy this game.
0783225725|5.0|I'm so glad I purchased this movie. I grew up watching it and decided to get it when it was cheap enough. I can't get enough of the spaghetti westerns!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was super excited when I found out I could download this game on my kindle I forgot I had it on my cell phone
B00A83075M|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Honestly, I tend not to get too excited when it comes to new releases from Disney. In my opinion, over the past few years, very few of their non-sequels have held any real value, and I’ve reached a point where I find myself just skipping them altogether, but a movie about video games? A movie centered on a video game character with multiple references to iconic franchises like Street Fighter, Sonic, and Pac Man? You don’t need to say much more than that to grab my attention. In fact, I’m surprised it took me this long to actually get around to watching Wreck-It Ralph.<br /><br />The story follows the titular Ralph (John C. Reilly) of the fictional arcade game, Fix-It Felix, Jr. For 30 years, Ralph has seen many games come and go, but his game has managed to keep a small amount of popularity among customers. However, after 30 years Ralph has become unsatisfied with being the bad guy. He wants to live in the nice hotel with the townspeople, he wants the pastries given to the hero Fix-It Felix, Jr. (Jack McBrayer), and he wants a little praise and recognition for his hard work. Unfortunately, after jumping games to achieve a medal, Ralph puts his game, and many others, in jeopardy.<br /><br />As the story progresses there are many cameos from different video game characters as well as references to video game history. For example, during the Bad-Anon support group—which is easily the most memorable segment from the entire film—you get to see appearances from Zangief and M. Bison from Street Fighter as well as Dr. Eggman from Sonic the Hedgehog and the orange ghost (aka Clyde) from Pac Man. In addition, there are a few other Street Fighter sightings as well as an appearance from Frogger and Q*bert. There is obviously a great deal of nostalgic love towards classic video games here and I’m more than okay with that.<br /><br />What I would have liked to have seen, though, was the inclusion of actual games worlds. With the exception of Tapper and the Pac Man grid, most of the story takes place either in the Fix-It Felix, Jr. or Sugar Rush arcade cabinets. I understand that these old arcade games don’t give you much to work with, but I’m sure they could have come up with something. Plus, in my opinion, the Sugar Rush world got old really fast. Still, I thought the way these characters traveled between cabinets was very creative, as was the Game Central Station.<br /><br />One thing that really surprised me was the story’s pacing and structure. While Wreck-It Ralph is always pushing forward, and there’s very little down time, the story never felt rushed or unfocused. There was always a clear goal in mind, and the journey there was both structured and entertaining at the same time. Also, I really enjoyed the unpredictability of the story’s ending. While I never feared for Ralph or Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) because this is a children’s movie, I was genuinely surprised by the big plot twist near the end.<br /><br />With that said, though, the writing is kind of a mixed bag. On one hand, it is very creative in the way they made these different game worlds interact with each other. On the other hand, they try too hard to appeal to the younger audience. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize why the main world we’re in is Sugar Rush, and there are some chunks of comedy that are obviously aimed solely at the children. The worst example would be toward the end when Ralph and Vanellope are exchanging crude names back and forth. These “creative” names range from “President Fartfeathers” to “Major Body Odor.”<br /><br />However, there is more than enough to get the older audience laughing as well. For example, when we first meet Sugar Rush’s main cast, there are two sets of bleachers. One that says “Assorted Fans”—a mix of different candy—and another that says “With Nuts.” The former are cheering normally while the latter isgoing insane. I’ll admit, I probably laughed at this longer than I should have. There were others as well, but that one stuck out the most to me.<br /><br />Finally, as with the writing, the voice acting is a mixed bag as well. For one, I really enjoyed John C. Reilly as Ralph and Jack McBrayer as Fix-It Felix, Jr. Both felt perfect for their roles, and they did a remarkable job with their characters. In addition, Jane Lynch was amazing as Sergeant Jean Calhoun, and Alan Tudyk’s King Candy felt strangely similar Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter, in a good way. However, I loathed what Silverman did with Vanellope. The girl is supposed to be, like, seven years old, but she sounds like she’s 50 with a really bad cold. For me at least, every time she spoke it sounded like nails on a chalkboard.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - It may be true that Wreck-It Ralph has its faults, but it’s still an enjoyable experience. The characters are charming, and there’s an obvious love of classic video games, which shows in many scenes. If you’re a Disney enthusiast, a video game lover, or a mixture of the two, there’s no reason you shouldn’t give this your time. It’s definitely something I would watch again.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham and  his courtroom-based, best-selling novels are read world-wide. Grisham books are published in multiple languages, made in to movies, featured on best seller lists, and are enjoyed by a wide variety of all types of readers.  The key to Grishams popularity is he never is formulatic, or predictable, somehow he manages to merge the courtroom and  key characters with enough individual complexity to make all of his stories compelling and hard to put down. Having said that, I wasn't at all impressed with &#34;Playing for Pizza&#34;, or &#34;Calico Joe&#34;, which were decent books, but not Grisham caliber; Grisham is so good at what he does, he has pigeonholed himself, when readers pick up a Grisham novel, their palate is prepared for a tasty morsel of legal suspense, not a romantic story about baseball. In his newest book &#34;Sycamore Row&#34;, loyal Grisham fans are reacquainted with the central characters from his novel &#34;A Time To Kill&#34;, and without spoiling the story line, human behavior in all of its glory and shame is central to the theme of the book, in particular the history of racial discrimination as it pertains to the South. This is by far Grishams best work in years, reminiscent of &#34;The Pelican Brief&#34; and &#34;The Firm&#34;, destined to become a best seller and feature film, worth every cent.
B00178JDCK|5.0|I was looking for a pedal with the Shimmer effect, and this is incredible!<br />Everything i needed is in this little blue box.
B009AMANH4|1.0|This was one of the biggest disappointing movies that I have seen in a long time. This movie was seriously boring from beginning to end!!!
0545615402|5.0|Couldn't ask for a better quality, love and will always love harry potter and this is great thank you !
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Fun challenges and rocket design.  Its like KSP lite, for my phone and tablet.  Definately worth what I paid. Meow.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|It is a classic dystopian story. Love, war, loss and revolution for change. It is similar to Battle Royale (look it up).
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|It was a good read but not as compelling as the reviews stated.  The concept was frightening, ie computers taking over all social media and eventually.......
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|The game is, of course, great. Lots of fun characters and beautiful graphics. BUT more ads than ever, more offers to buy super-powers then I've ever seen in Rovio products, and even ads for non-related products and games. I've been an Angry Birds fan since they first came out, but now I'm just an Angry Fan, and this will be my last purchase of any Rovio Entertainment product. They have really crossed the line with the ads.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Truth is stranger than fiction! No spoiler-but a good fright! Well worth the rental price! Great acting from everyone. This movie will actually make your heart skip  a beat!
B00BHNR1KQ|1.0|The movie stopped playing at 23 min I tried resetting nothing worked hope I get my money back not happy
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read this book cover to cover in just a few days. The story was incredibly gripping. I found myself having to go back and reread entire pages because I had gotten so excited I had started skimming! Will definitely recommend to anyone who'll listen!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love minecraft just it needs better multiplayer and needs bigger worlds and more stuff like caves and a nether portal also plz put flint steal in creative
B001EC2ISA|2.0|Creative, but lacking in plot. I think having seen this again as an adult, I can now understand my confusion in viewing it as a child.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|It succeeds as a humorous and entertaining movie.  I am not sure what many of the critics of the movie expected, but if you like the MIB movies you will likely enjoy this movie.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Would be better priced at $3 no more. Honestly I think $2 is more accurate but that's my opinion based on the quality and overall worth of this film, not its popularity and recent release.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is great because it has good graphics. I'm tired of having no redstone in this game. THIS IS YET TOO GET REDSTONE!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love that kindle has candy crush now!!!! my kids love playing itand now they don't hog my phone :))) happy momma
B00000J048|5.0|I bought this for my 20 month old and i think I have more fun with it than he does! Its really cool. In this age group, it has to be used with supervision as there are small parts, but i will be a good toy for him to grow with. I would def buy this again.
B001U7FW1O|5.0|The highest form of worship is the worship of unselfish Christian service. The greatest form of praise is the sound of consecrated feet seeking out the lost and helpless.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book held my interest throughout - from beginning to end.  It was creative..  I loved the way the author writes such vivid details and descriptions.  Great story
B004ZJZQJC|5.0|This movie is a standard-setter in many ways. This film was one of the 1st to use such extensive use of CGI effects. The technology was in its infancy in 1984 when this film was released. This was a great sci-fi film that was great to look at, but very entertaining, even now. Christopher Guest, Robert Preston, Dan O'Herlihy and Catherine Mary Stewart all star in this very different genre film. For those who remember this time, arcade games were the only way to game in those days and they were just starting to hit their stride in '84. Anyway, the video game, Starfighter (which was created exclusively by Atari for this movie), is used as a recruiting tool for an intergalactic hustler (Preston) of sorts to recruit starfighters to aid them in their intergalactic conflicts. A simple high school student (Guest) ends up scoring the high score and is soon swept away into the stars. The story then becomes a mix of what he's encountering up there and what is occuring in his absence while his substitute, an android called Beta, wreaks havok on his already unsteady life.<br />A great film that mixes action with a little humor to lighten the experience. Highly recommended.
B00170GXQ2|5.0|Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins give stellar performances in movie.  A new twist on an old classic is true to the original story.  Very enjoyable.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Book directed toward younger readers. I always like to read books before I recommend them to my teenage grandson. This is a fabulous story about teenagers dealing with cancer and death. Very insightful. I highly recommend it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|ive been playing for a very long time. its a fun game but you must wait a very long time for eggs to hatch. I have not spent a dollar of real cash on this game and I just passed level 60. every day I collect. my girl collects when I cant. I play on a kindle fire so its easy to access.  if on a PC I might have gave up a long time ago. best way to level up is to save your coins. the higher the level, the longer you have to wait but the higher the rewards. its cool if you can commit.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|A great band, a great, album, a great time. This CD, like all the others released by Avenged Sevenfold is rocking and fun to listen to!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book carries you on excitement and curiosity.  The description of the events are so vivid that you just feel you're living the pains, the surprises, the joys. Really enjoyed it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|As romance novels go, this one wasn't all I was expecting.  I had heard rave reviews and was frankly disappointed...especially with the ending.  Maybe that was a way to get people to buy the follow ups, but if the others are like this, I really don't want to waste my money.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|So similar to other Cross Fire novels.  Doesnt  move as fast & smooth or with excitement as other 2 previous novels
0321334876|5.0|There is a lot of very useful information in this book for people coming to c++ from others oop languages.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So very Happy, happy, happy to have the Crush finally. Love the game and am having fun, challenges and sweetness with the Crush!!!<br />Thank you thank you thank you
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Picked by mistake.  Not what we thought it was (a word game).  My bad.  I need to pay more attention to the description.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent book!  Nice to see how his brilliance developed and actually how it has changed our lives for the better !
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Good movie as long as you realize it's an action flick that can be watched several times over and still enjoyed.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Consider yourself fortunate to have found such a fantastic read.  I regret not having read this sooner.  Markus Zusak, bravo!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've been playing minecraft for a while now and  from the start I LOVED IT!!!!!!! It is so cool totally worth the 7$
B00BD99JMW|1.0|No defined plot.  It is like she didn't know what to do with the characters and the whole book just falls flat.  One thing I never do is peek at the ending of a book but with this one I did. I was a little over half way through and so bored I needed to know if I should keep reading so I took a peek through the rest of the book and got the gist of what happens...it was such a letdown I just tossed it aside and will not pick it up again.  I pre-read a lot of books for the middle school I work in so I read a lot of junk...this was below that.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Great series with a consistent storyline. An era as you have never seen it before. I don't usually get into these season to season deals but I own every one. Adults only
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Although it works well with google chrome and other google apps, it doesn't work at all with apps such as windows media player that come up as an embedded app in chrome.  The picture is good and the installation is easy.  Just make sure that you know what you're going to use it for
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad this app is finally available on my kindle!! I haven't had any issues with loading - it works perfectly! my favorite app by far!
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I stayed interested all the way till the last few chapters.  I think she got tired becasue the end chapters were not nearly as wonderful as the rest of the story.
B00FX8FQ76|4.0|Great album overall, a pretty big departure from teenage dream. All the songs are pretty progressive for dance pop except for birthday which is just annoying. A must purchase for any pop fan.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Genius program -- brings back memories -- not all good.  Great casting, great acting, great story line.  Roger will you ever grow up.  Highly recommend.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Playing FlipPix takes my mind off of the latest bad news and gives it a place to go that is both fun and won't result in a tax debt if I choose not to play.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Good but takes a little while to download its a fun game my sister and brother both play it. :)
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen! Hilarious comedy and tearjerking drama all in one Make this one of the most wonderful theatrical experiences you can have.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|This show is a classic - right up there with All In The Family, Mary Tyler Moore Show, I Love Lucy, Everybody Loves Raymond.  I highly recommend it .
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Very good sound quality. Looped well so no recurring hiccups. Nice selection of sounds with good interface. Would strongly reccomend to anyone who uses ambient sounds
B00BD99JMW|4.0|a great ending to the series...I'll miss reading about the factions and dauntless games.<br />twists and turns you'll NEVER expect
1600108512|5.0|I've read the Peter Beagle novel and watched the animation I don't know how many times, but this was a real revelation. True to the text without taking some of the animated liberties (Why did the kitchen cat at Haggard's have to sound like a pirate?), it told the story well. And the artwork: from beginning to end, including the lovely rabbit scribe on the last page, it was all beautifully done. This is refined gold.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|it is awesome and much better. than deer hunter reloaded ive played it on my friends ipad but I loved it
B00000JFV9|5.0|When I listen to this album, I am reminded that all this great music was made from scratch !!<br /><br />Curtis Mayfield is part of my musical genius team, to be sure  !!
B00992CF6W|1.0|1) All the same things.<br />2)no sliver fish in the world.<br />And 3 very endless supply of stuff in creative mods.
B007MJSSCY|4.0|This movie is for ages about twelve and up. I am a grandmother and I enjoyed it on Amazon's movie rental. I would add this to my collection for the appropriate aged grandkids. The actors did a good job, and who doesn't love the talented acting abilities of Maggie Smith.
006202406X|5.0|I have been waiting for someone to do this. Something unexpected, something that will stay in your mind and heart for well awhile. For example the Hunger Games I knew it was going to be an happy ending or the protagonist lives. The Protagonist lover might die but not them. She has now played with my emotions but has showed me a reason to die. I don't know how to explain it but I made me think about just how to really do what you have to do for your loved ones. Everyone is complaing how Veronica Roth killed Tris and how she played with their feelings and misused them. But Veronica showed us something else. At first I hated it now I see the real point and love it.

And their critics ???<br /><br />Where are they now ???<br /><br />....probably in their 60's and living in their Mom's basement... again...<br /><br />PS - A REAL cabbie's tip for you...<br /> The building on this album cover is located in NYC on St. Mark's place ... FYI ...  ;)
B003NX75B8|5.0|This book was the sweetest thing!! Such a tearjerker!! The characters and the plot are so original, it just sucks you into the story to the point where you actually believe you are a real bystander in all of this madness, in which you are! Great job John Green and David Levithan!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like the angry bird series of games.  Both I and my children can enjoy them and challenge each other.  I look forward to more angry bird games in the future.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This is fun game. I'd rather compete against other players. Great for something to do. I would recommend for children.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is probably the most grossly underrated album in the history of rock music.<br /><br />Gets VERY little airplay from the music &#34;$$$ INDUSTRY $$$,&#34; but stands the test of time very well.  ;D
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Brad Stone provides rare insights into how Amazon transformed into the giant it is today. Filled with some of the smartest, most driven employees around, this is a company that has a clear mission, as articulated by Jeff Bezos. There are costs to the service provided to customers and employees of Amazon often bear the burden of those costs. Right or wrong, this is how Amazon has grown and dominated. Brad does a superb job of offering unique insights, insider information and brings to light both the good and ugly of a phenomenally successful company.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Fun game, adds are minimal.  Loads fine on my DOPO T711 from Amazon app store.  I plan on getting the other games.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|It is a great fun game. Makes you think of different strategies. Always challenging.<br /> For Everyone who likes to compete!

B000SE0OYA|5.0|This was easy to install and came with instructions on how to remove and put back in the parts needed to get to the Waste Toner Pack. Highly recommended.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book. We chose it for our book club and everyone was completely satisfied. Khaled Hosseini has another hit.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I gave my original to my grandchildren and needed one for myself. Thanks I am truly enjoying my purchase.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|And the Mountain Echoed is a beautifully written story of family, each story told from the individual's unique perspective.  The political and economic changes within Afghanistan serve as a background to their stories, shaping and molding the lives of each family member.
0060776579|5.0|Heard about it at a sales training class so wanted to 'read' it myself. Harv Eker is an absolute hoot reading his own stuff and the content is really good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy that this tasty puzzle adventure is finally on Kindle fire. I love candy crush saga. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys match-3 or puzzle games.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Thank you!  I am now complete.  Now I get why my friends are addicted.  Divine!  Tasty!  Yum!  Super sweet!  Fun with candy
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I check the weather at our new vacation/future retirement home morning and evening - along with the weather here at home - so I can begin to get a sense of what to expect when we get there.  This is the perfect tool for that purpose - just temperature and prevailing conditions - rain, overcast, sunny, etc.  Toggle easily between locations.
B0085PFG1U|4.0|We love the app for my sons math class as its way cheaper than an actual graphing calculator but most of these apps have an automatic conversion function to slope intercept form that this one does not.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What can I say? This series is just addictive. It is both educational and fun to watch. It actually has the ability to pull you into the story and make you think you're living there with them! I highly recommend the whole series!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This is one of a number of Tinkerbelle dvd's that my grandaughter has and enjoys. She is 10 andanything with Tink is a big hit!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of the best reads in awhile.  I think this is an excellent sequel for Time to Kill and enjoyed seeing the characters reprised.
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|Best horror I have seen in recent years.  The film is a great ride throughout.  The plot is not overly complex, but it is neatly set in place and original.  This is a truly horrific film- not a slasher flick.  It relies heavily on suspenseful scenes rather than relying on a ton of cheap jump scenes, and leaves you feeling haunted and disturbed.  Absolutely five stars.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|One of my favorite movies! I loved the disc with all the behind the scene information. It was neat to see where the Von Trapps are now & to find out little secrets of the movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|Interesting story line! I appreciate that it is not a remake of an old movie or show. Acting was well done and the scenery was interesting. Plus, what movie with Donald Sutherland is a bad movie?
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book had me laughing out loud so hard for about 20 pages, laughing so hard my husband came to see if I was okay. You see I am disabled, in a wheelchair or (bedridden, so I have a lot of time on my hands to read. This book took me back to A Time To kill but only enough to make us remember what happened in that one. Since this one has a lot of the old  characters it was interesting from page one. Don't like to give spoilers as that is not my thing. But will say this was a very good/excellent book for the reader......I entered to win you collection's signed but since I don't win anything in life I probably will not have a chance....maybe I could some how meet you one day and get the ones I have been able to buy for you to sign. I would cherish them for ever, and read them over and over. This is how much I love your books...sad is we live out in the sticks of no where land in NE Nevada. NO real bookstores here, I find them at the grocery store the first week after released at a grocery store at a great discount but after the first week they go up to the retail price. Being on social security disability it is hard to buy the books I want to read and add to my collection...We do have a library but it is 30 miles into town over a mountain summit so I try to only go to town once a month to see my doctors or sometimes I have to go twice a month...I know sounds crazy, but where would your closest book signing be to NE Nevada 89815 is closest zip to us. Please let me know if you can when you will be near or can I get a list of tour dates and where and maybe if a town is close to one of my 7 sisters that might be able to make the signing to get mine signed for me. Sorry for the long comment but I loved this new book Sycamore Row so much I wanted to send a noted to write you here. I do hope you or you workers do read the comments. There is one of the few things I want to do before my body gives up and that is to meet the best suspense/law cases I have ever read. Bless you for writing such great books, this disabled person never wants to live without your books....is there a better place  to email Mr Grisham ?  Or just here after we finish a book and put in a review....Thanks all for reading<br /><br />.or writing such great books, this disabled person never wants to live without your books....is there a better place  to email Mr Grisham ?

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I really love that the Marvel comics are on the big screen now. I think they do a great job of portraying the characters from the comic books. The action is always fantastic too.
0753541637|3.0|The book came on time and in great shape.  The book was an easy read.  However, it sort of kept repeating her message over and over again.  Once I read the first couple chapters I got the message.  Didn't need to read anymore.  Sorry for those of you that loved it.  It was a good book club book though.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I loved the comic book stories as a kid and Thor was always my favorite hero. This movie was awesome!
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|This is a frustrating game in which slender man spans directly in front of you, pages all in a trail, not to mention from a distance you can state at him. -_-
B00CBKLO52|5.0|While some may consider this a game, I see it more as a flight training tool. As a private pilot, I learned to fly Cessnas back in the 70's before flight simulators on computers. Trying to fly my first radio controlled plane, I was astonished at how difficult it was to maneuver and land without crashing. The problem was not my lack of flight knowledge. It was a change of perspective to the aircraft. I was used to seeing the forward perspective through a cokpit window.<br /><br />Any man who's ever looked into a mirror to shave can do it without thinking. But try doing it while looking into a live TV monitor where right and left are reversed from what you see in the mirror. It's really hard. Or try writing a sentence with your left hand if you are right handed (or visa versa). Your brain can not interpret the visuals without taking extra time to translate the new perspective. That extra thinking time flying an RC plane is enough to allow a crash. Of course, with enough practice, you can overcome this. But your brain needs to retrain itself to the new perspective. And that's where this simple little program comes to the rescue.<br /><br />First, setting up the program is simple. There is an easy menu that is self explanatory. You can select one of three craft for free; a plane, a helicopter or a boat. Other planes and vehicles cost extra, but for training purposes, you won't need them. You can tailor the control sticks to allocate throttle, elevator, rudder and ailerons between the right and left sticks. Naturally, those with some level of flight experience will understand what each control does. Non fliers will be challenged at first.<br /><br />Flying a remotely operated craft from a fixed location is quite a different perspective from flying with a forward looking view from inside the aircraft. I think it's more difficult flying something remotely. At first, it was quite difficult to maneuver the helicopter, even though I completely understood the flight controls. I would get it in the air, and after a few control inputs, it would begin to spin wildly. After about twenty minutes of practicing with the helicopter in four different aspects (flying toward me, flying away from me, or flying it from the right or left side) I was able to keep the copter flying. When I wanted to yaw right, I had to manually think about it first if the copter was headed toward me, because in that position, right control turns left, and left control turns right. And that's the crux of the problem flying any remote aircraft. The perspective is constantly changing depending upon the orientation of the aircraft. The beauty of this program is that you can crash to your hearts content until you get it right, and no aircraft is damaged.<br /><br />Naturally, each flier will adapt to the new flight perspectives at different rates. I believe younger fliers will adapt faster than old guys like me. But after a few days of using this little simulator, it became much easier to fly a remote controlled helicopter without crashing it. And there's a few hundred bucks saved just by learning on this free program. This program should be included with every RC device.I would get it in the air, and after a few control inputs, it would begin to spin wildly.

B000003TAW|3.0|I like weezer but honestly I only liked about 4 songs from this whole CD. The CD was not scratched which I was happy about. The case however was a bit wrecked. Nothing too big of a deal but still... All in all it was a great price but the shipping took forever.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Nice watch...very easy on the eyes...comfortable band...unbeatable price.  If you're in the market for a good solid no frills watch put your money on this one
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I love vampire weekend but never wanted to spend a lot of money on their CDs and this was the perfect price! The CD was not at all scratched (which I was worried about) and the case was in perfect condition! I love all the songs on this CD. SHIPPING WAS FAST!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This is a good movie, but if you can, boycott Movies that do not not include DIGITAL COPIES along with or instead of Ultra Violet.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Sound is clear and it is easy to use.  Just plug it in to your camera and you are ready to go.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|The USB-&#62;micro USB cable that came with my Kindle a few years back was by far the longest reaching of all my devices.  That said, I used it to charge things like my Android phone.  Maybe it's the fact that I use it non-stop for multiple things, but this is the 4th one I've had.  The others all begin to fray at the micro USB end.  I throw electrical tape around there when it happens, but in the end, it's a battle against time.  The only other thing I can think of is that the majority of my devices have the charging area at the bottom, so there are times when the plug is apt to experience additional stress at that point (due to the cord bending at that angle when I'm sitting/reclining, etc.).
B001O94E76|4.0|And you call yourself a fan of horror films, shame on you.<br /><br />THIS is one incredible sample of cinema, and if it seems old and idiomatic, it is because it has been oft-emulated.<br /><br />At the least watch it less as a movie ... And MORE as a progression of images, and you will see how much the cinematography impacted the final cut.<br /><br />It is also a lesson in lighting, as well as storyboard development.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is perfect game for me. Keeps me on my toes and releases alot of my daily stress. Love it!!! Highly recommend
B0039M48FE|3.0|This covers an important period in Spanish history.  It begins well, with the only decent action in man to man combat.  The film then becomes bogged down with long periods of Charlton or Sophia staring.  With less staring it could have been a 90 minute film.  The battle scenes were rather ho hum.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I could not put this book down! Orson Scott Card is amazingly gifted at weaving plot, picture, and narrative. Amazing!
