B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was a touching story about giving, having a purpose, and how to live life to the fullest.<br />I loved it!<br />I thought it was hard to put down and written very well.<br />It was a surprise to me how much I enjoyed reading Jojo Moyes' work.  I haven't read anything by her/him<br />before.  I would recommend it!
B003Y7AR7C|5.0|This was the most fantastic DVD of ALL of the nutcracker ballets I've seen, just loved it.  Miyako was spectacular.
B009AY04A8|4.0|love hidden objects.  hate all the conversations.  waaaay too long. almost gave up on the game because of it. glad I kept on. I give it 4 stars for the games. -2 for the conversations
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I liked the combination of actors in was entertained throughout from the beginning to the end. They actually made a good movie.
B00008G8LG|5.0|Epic is a word that gets loosely thrown around, but I can't think of another descriptor that fits this movie better. It has everything a true epic requires, starting with a strong (and true) story line and marvelous acting. I am not a huge Foster fan, but she, and the entire cast, were absolutely captivating. It's a visually and emitionally striking film, and I would highly recomend it to anyone!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I heard this on a streaming sight so I checked out what else Lorde had out there and I bought just about all of it. So far there is only one song that im okay skipping.
1465408681|4.0|This book is a good overview of the new Yoda Chronicles series characters, but I was expecting more plot background and perhaps more of a small collection of stories. Younger fans will like this book, and the mini-figure is unique and will make a good collectible item.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I did not renew Prime Time, which cancelled the &#34;free&#34; book.  I then looked around and found the book for free anyways.
140006922X|4.0|Aslan presents the life, words and actions of Jesus in the context of his time to reveal a very different picture then then conventional Sunday school portrait. A thought provoking read that left me wanting to learn more.
0385349947|5.0|There were many aspects of women working out of the home that I hadn't considered.  I also enjoyed the discussion of stay-at-home moms and dads.  I don't understand why the book is so controversial.  I found it though provoking.
B009CQMZ6K|4.0|Works well enough for the price paid. Fast shipping and suction cup works good.Wish the arm was a little longer. Thumbs up.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|One of the best war movies ever. God bless gen Moore and all those who served in vietnam.<br />Five stars
B00COCY67A|5.0|I bought three of this set with the intention of giving two away before I'd even heard the recordings. After hearing the set, I've ordered more because I have to share it with more friends/family!<br /><br />This collection is wonderful. Elvis sounds fantastic, the band is tight. Along the way Elvis reminisces about the good times during the fantastic number, \\"Talk About the Good Times\\", but the truth is the Good Times were there in these recordings.<br /><br />The mixes are expertly presented. Some, like my mom, prefer the last CD of the set. This is the one that contains all the final RCA mixes from the albums. They were highly engineered. For example, horn sections and string orchestras appear in tracks that featured none of that during the recording session, and things get engineered for radio play (including AM). My preference is for the first two of the three CD's. These feature the raw studio takes, just Elvis and his TCB band and backup singers. Elvis amazes with his raw vocal talent, and his musical relationship with the players and singers on hand.<br /><br />Elvis was a true master of \\"Jam Sessions\\", and live performances. Really no need ever existed to sex him up with all the post production and tweaking. He was the consummate \\"natural\\". What's so fun about this set is that you see that in so many spades, how dominant and powerful his talent really was. Amidst all the pre-take banter and carrying on, the band suddenly strikes up and Elvis instantly launches into Command Singer Mode, sexily overwhelming the scene with his master and sly presence. It is truly remarkable. The King still had the goods on tap during these recordings.<br /><br />They are wonderful. Highly recommend.
1623650003|3.0|I was given a copy of Alex by a Quercus editor as I am a fan of European crime writers. At first glance I was intrigued especially because of the glowing reviews and the awards won by the author. As I read on I found myself actually disliking the protagonist, Camille, and wondering how a middle-aged, 4'11&#34; police inspector with a tragic personal life could even function much less lead a homicide team. The whole things beggared my belief and, despite my trying not to do so, I found myself comparing the story line and characters with top notch crime authors like Jo Nesbo or Ian Rankin or Arne Dahl. Yes, there are twists and turns and some surprises but, overall, I found the book just okay and, definitely, not to be spoken of with the same reverence as Stieg Larsson. I see I am in the minority here. Sorry 'bout that.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Suits holds my interest throughout the entire show. Good storylines. Unexpected twists to a predictable situation. Keep up the good work.
B0055SWM08|5.0|challenging the first time and fun a few weeks later as you try to get the perfect score.<br />I like the ability to see the perfect sequence if you get caught.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Like all of Hosseini's books, this one is well worth reading. Beautifully written, evocative of childhood, adulthood, and the regrets of old age, it tells the stories of a family, through the life experiences of its members, in such a delicate and loving manner as to bring tears at times, and laughs at other times, whilst all the while delicately constructing and cherishing the value of family ties and good, selfless deeds, of one family member after another. A memorable and absorbing story, rich with many delicate layers of emotion. Do read it!
0062081527|3.0|The book is excellent.  The large print was easy on the eyes.  A few pages were bent.  Not worth returning for, but preventing a 5 star rating.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|Hi everyone! this 2 dvd´s are part of my hart now. I just loved them! I had a smile on my face all the way...
B009B1UZ7C|4.0|Jake Bugg names among his influences the Beatles, Johnny Cash, Donovan, and the Everly Brothers.  This shines through on his eponymous debut album.  It does not sound over-produced like so much other modern pop music.  The instrumentation is not excessive but still does not sound too sparse -- the sound is full enough, especially while accompanying Bugg's slightly reedy tenor.  The song writing is good, with Bugg writing or co-writing all the songs.  I look forward to his sophomore effort.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome I luv it it updates to a new place every month it's just amazing subway surfers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEAH WOO
B00B19GKI0|2.0|Should we just make a list of the things that are lame about this film? Let's see-- A lead actor newly escaped from Disney doing a bad Clint Eastwood impersonation. Famous character actors doing their worst work since they were unknowns. Adrienne Barbeau contributing only two lines and two mammeries. Villains that couldn't get booked on the latest Cheech and Chong movie.<br /><br />Folks, \\"The Road Warrior\\" this is not, and Isaac Hayes is no Tina Turner. Other reviewers are rating this mess with the same number of stars accorded to films like Ben-Hur, Citizen Kane, and 2001. Thankfully it's not as long as some of them. Or maybe I've got it all wrong. You say it's actually a comedy! Oh, that changes everything.<br /><br />I recommend it be booked as the last show, on the last night, of the last drive-in movie theater on earth.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|cool beans I like love it man.<br />numbers are nice easy to press and read.also has memory function I use a lot<br />. they should have given us one with kindle.<br />hubby.  h h  th th j h  h h h h.  hmm<br />unknown Hanukkah and intuitive interface is just too much of a hitch.
B001CU1RRW|5.0|This is a great CD and am so glad that I could get it through Amazon Rock on Bruce and the E-Street Band!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was very addictive. From start to finish I didn't want to put the book down. I would highly recommend this book.
B00EEN7CAK|4.0|I only watched this movie because my mom was begging me to watch it with her! Wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.Good cast of actors. I felt at times certain details or explanations were left out but over all better than expected.
0345803507|5.0|I think all first time parents are afraid that they won't know how to love or raise their children.  It is a freightening ordeal and not everyone steps up to the challenge, but when they do ... heaven.  This was a very happy ending to a very believable love story.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|I found all aspects of this show amazing.  The acting, directing, local............it's all done extremely well.  The camara work alone is worth watching the show for.
0345803493|5.0|The romantic in me wanted to see them back together and that happened a little too quickly.  Perhaps the author could have allowed a little more separation time and even thrown in a couple of affairs, but the, I was not the author.  I did really enjoy the little twists and looked forward to the third installment.  I would recommend it to anyone out there who feels as though they are the only ones who have been challenged in love.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Sachi bared her soul and tells it like it is. I loved how it was written, like a jigsaw puzzle of her life that she had to find the pieces to. Well done!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|The DVDS were in excellent condition, watched it as soon as it arrived.  Love Sons of Anarchy....Love Jaxs and Opppie!!!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Enjoyable read so far, takes a little bit to get into it, but definitely interesting, and for someone who is not really into the whole zombie thing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was surprise at how engaging it is.  I didn't expect to get stuck at all.  My tip would be to put it down for awhile then go back later and the answer will seem simple.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Interesting, fast-paced story line with consummate acting, and wonderful special effects.  It really grabs you and pulls you into the movie.
B004I744AS|5.0|Just picked this up on the application market. I really like the presentation of the content. Each search is save  so you can go back and reviews  quickly if needed. This is a great, quick, and easy app for dictionary references.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Loving<br />Entertain<br />Nice<br />Beautiful<br />Funny<br />Addictive<br />Different<br />Original<br />Intelligent<br />Interesting<br />Is really funny and addictive,I love it. It has a lot of imagination.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|dredd got shot in the back with an armor piercing round. But he's fine and still kicks ass. How??? Because he's dredd
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Yeah, had a couple different ones, but none of them felt quite right.  This is the real Deal.  Feel is amazing, grip is really good, the phone doesn't slide around when set down, and ports are accessible with larger plugs (my old Monoprice cords work fine).<br /><br />cannot recommend enough.
B001KZG99A|4.0|I'm purchasing this  DVD for my Grandson, Iron Man is his hero, and he loves this DVD.  His birthday was August 27, I thought this would be a nice birthday present for him.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I bought this book for my slender husband who works out three times a week and was complaining about his big belly! A couple of my friends on fb were talking about it and I wondered if that was the reason for his big belly. He has yet to read the book!! But, it is so very interesting and informative. Explains things so that you understand completely about our poor foods. I didn't know there was anything wrong with me and I only quit eating the wheat because of what the book said!! Here are a few of the results I experienced from dropping the wheat: My hands are no longer stiff, swollen, or painful...the pain in my shoulders is GONE, my calves are no longer tight and painful... I attributed all of the previous ailments to my job as a massage therapist!!! I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS FROM THE WHEAT!!! That is really scary when you can attribute all of your ailments to your job, exercise, etc and not even know it is what you are ingesting! I am know a disciple. It has forever changed my health! Thank you Dr. William Davis!!!
1250012570|5.0|To be honest, I had low hopes for this simplistic story line -- however, once begun, I could not put it down. Like a teenager, I gorged on it in bed every night with a flashlight until I turned the last page. It captures the essence of teenage true love.  You get to re-feel all of the desperation and urgency and the mind-blowing good parts.  Anyone who was in love in high school will relate on an intimate level and thanks to Rainbow Rowell, can now vividly remember those hormone-charged, over-the-top, electric feelings. Bravo!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a fun game for the entire family. My oldest daughter showed it to me and now in an hooked. A good game when travelling.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I was bored and downloaded this to wait for bed. I missed sleep and wide awake now. It is worth it.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This is a very addictive game that is easy, but challenging at the same time. You must clear the board so a little strategy is required before you start. My one complaint is that each time the small ad changes at the top of the screen, it interrupts the game briefly. Irritating, at least.
0307719774|4.0|Love the idea, really nice and small enough to take anywhere - just very hard to remember to do it every day!!!<br />In saying that I think it will be great to look back on later down the track!
B00ECU2SGS|2.0|A bunch of great actors in one movie which slowly methodically leads you on to believe a climactic ending, but are left with a &#34;THAT'S IT,&#34; feeling.  I did not like it. Waste of time.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|This is my favorite season of the Borgias. It has a better storyline than the first season, and it is not as gross as the third (meaning the relationship between Cesare and Lucrenzia). I recommend this show to everybody well except for the people who played Assassin's Creed 2. Only reason is in the game the Borgia family are the bad guys.
0525425772|4.0|Very entertaining.  I am an avid fan of John Grisham, having read most of his books and watched all of the movies that<br />were based on his books.  I look forward to enjoying more of John Gtisham.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I find this game to be very entertaining and fun to play. I love the different rooms rooms and the comments from people from around the world.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|First, let me say that I love this series and the characters in it. <br />Gideon and Eva are meant to be together. I don't understand why the author didn't end it that way.  The majority of the book consisted of sex and more sex.  They are constantly professing their love for one another,  but are still so unsure of themselves.  I just hope the next book will finally provide us with  closure.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|James dashner outdid himself this time. I would recommend this book to all people. Everyone should read this book now.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|This is my favorite series and I am so excited to own all four seasons! All of my disks arrived in proper secure packaging and have run quite well! THANKS!
B00AEBBAEU|5.0|*points at map* What's this? Why don't I own this?  WHY.. DON'T.. I.. OWWWN THIS?  *begins to dream of drinking of milkshakes*

B001LF347E|5.0|My husband and I are very picky about the shows we watch. We happened across Merlin and fell in love instantly! The humor between Arthur and Merlin is absolutely hilarious. Some of the episodes get a little intense with crazy creatures, but then there are some that I allow my children to watch. All around great fun show!
B003L77GH4|5.0|This is my favorite series and I am so excited to own all four seasons! All of my disks arrived in proper secure packaging and have run quite well! THANKS!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Awesome special effects.  Kind of stole some ideas from Matrix, but I liked the Matrix so it was fine.  Ending is kind of funny.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I confess that I bought this book after watching Tom Cruise portray Jack Reacher at the movies. the movie was non-stop action. I expected the author's books to be the same. Instead, I found it to be over five hundred tedious pages that left me exasperated in the end. I never did figure out who the main bad guy leader was supposed to be! I forced myself to keep reading thinking that surely the next scene or the next chapter would bring on that thrilling suspense I was expecting. Obviously, that never happened. One thing on the positive side--there was no vulgarity! That I appreciated. I will read another book by this author--at least I will give him a chance to win me as a fan. but as for this book, don't waste tour money or your time!
B00005JKC3|3.0|The main disc had scratches etc on it, and there was some stalling during play. The bonus disc looked unused. Considering the price I can't honestly say it was unexpected, but it was hardly in the &#34;like new&#34; condition the seller described. Describing it as &#34;good&#34; or better yet &#34;fair&#34; would have been more realistic. Again, considering the price, it was a decent buy.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Best show on TV.  Having it on my laptop lets me view it where ever I am and while waiting for the DVD version!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Interesting game, wish it was longer though. I was able to finish it in 2 days and did enjoy figuring it all out. I guess it was worth the $2.99.
B005LAIII0|5.0|From nearly the beginning of \\"life of Pi\\" to near the end, I was riveted to the screen.  It's an extremely artfully crafted movie based on an equally good story.  The last time I felt this engrossed in a movie was \\"District 9\\" over 3 years ago.<br /><br />The ending was a bit of a letdown - most of which had a lot to do with, through the accent, I couldn't understand what the actor was saying.  From what I could piece together, the movie wasn't smoothly capturing the alternate viewpoint to the story, as told in the original book. Even then, it doesn't matter, the majority of the movie is so awesome, all 5 stars are still warranted.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|but the wife will love it. So if you are a guy bring along something manly to do while your wife eats it all up.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|With facebook and Google plus allowing instant syncing of my photos..whats the point of this? not a fan..sorry cant do it
B00003CXBH|5.0|bought this for my hubby, as he requested it.  made us cry.  a great movie, worth my time to watch!
B006N0YWGY|4.0|This game has superb graphics and nice fluid motion. The only problem is, it gets repetitive.  you have to go over the same courses over and over again.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|Be advised, app install left malware on Kindle Fire. Might be fixed, but at least scan the app before use.
B00CDY6HW6|1.0|Have no idea how to rate, since I never ordered it nor have it on any of my devices. This must be a mistake to my account.
B00CEJ2H6K|4.0|I just don't like this as much as I have their last two. (Vs is my favorite, although Twilight comes close) The songs are good, but I guess this album somehow just doesn't \\"thrill\\" me as much. I can't really explain it.<br /><br />I really disliked the track \\"Hel\\". Intensely. I don't know who that is singing, but it is just horrible. Save that kind of singing for the ladies. The first time I heard it, I deleted it off my playlist.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This album is awesome.  I play the songs all the time.  The sounds are sharp and keep the beat moving.
B003E74B24|5.0|A wonderful read! Entertaining and interesting at the same time. It gave me new insight on one of my favorite celebrity chefs. I loved it!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This album is awesome.  I play the songs all the time.  The sounds are sharp and keep the beat moving.
B0054N73EY|4.0|As a huge RHCP fan, I really like most of the songs on the I'm With You album.  It has the same sounds as their last two albums, which is ok to me.
B00005RIKI|5.0|This album is awesome.  I play the songs all the time.  The sounds are sharp and keep the beat moving.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy this game and wish I could play more not sure if I have to buy app or what to get more levels.
B00006690G|5.0|This album is awesome.  I play the songs all the time.  The sounds are sharp and keep the beat moving.
141659521X|5.0|This book was cheap for a hardback book!  Looks like it has been read one time.  In great shape for a used book.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This book was brought to my attention by someone I met who seemed to be on a road to a positive way of life.  I really am not one for this particular topic being that I read many books of this subject  in my youth and found that they were not for me.  That being said, the information in this book wasn't totally new, meaning the agreements are pretty much what I have learned and tried to aspire to throughout my life (at least some of them) but I did like it's simplicity and easy language.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking a way to clarify their life.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game so much fun and I<br />Lick how they made the monster<br />Bigger then the monster from temple<br />Run temple run2  is so much better
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Doesn't make you crazy..just a nice logic game.  I have the free version and don't get those game circle pop ups someone else mentioned.  After a few games, you can see the necessary first moves, so it's probably a good brain exercise.  I usually like word games, but this is an entertaining change of pace.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite game out of everything this game is fantastic[[ASIN:B00CHYKVPQ Acer DA220HQL 21.5-Inch All-in-One Touchscreen Desktop (Black)]] this is one of the bets game ever this is a good game to me as nd others
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|As generally noted, this is a filler game.  It isn't the sort you are going to find yourself playing for 5 hours of a time.  But that isn't to say that you couldn't play it 2-3 times in a row, without growing bored.<br /><br />A person would buy this game if they were looking for a game that was fast-paced, not too long, and easy to teach... but not dumb.  The small number of cards makes it a good game to play outside, especially if you put card protectors on them (63x88mm).<br /><br />The people that are really good at this game are the same people who are good at poker.  Because the cards you receive are random, making the most of them involves your ability to read the people you're playing with.  You estimate what cards your opponents have (and your potential to exploit that), by tracking the cards played and watching their decision making processes at each hand.  It's a bit like if Clue and Poker had a baby.<br /><br />There are plenty of games that involve more strategy and challenge, and this game isn't going to stand up to them.  Its strengths are in its accessibility.  But it really is fun for people that fully engage with it.  If you just play your hand and don't play your fellow gamers, then you will get bored fast.  Sure there's a lot of luck involved, but if you play with someone who's a skilled analyst, they will win most rounds.  The storyline of the love letter isn't really intrinsic to game play, but the characters give you more stuff to joke around about, so it's good they're there.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love the blend of poetry and everyday life of a teen cancer patient.  Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters meet in a cancer support group.  They want to be more than someone to take care of, more than a victim.<br />I can't pinpoint what I loved about this book without telling too much of the story.<br /><br />I decided to read it after reading good reviews in several magazines, and I'm so glad I did!  I read 40-50 books a year and I have to say this is my favorite of 2013.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|good product and price....easy to install and works as it was intended to do...very satisfied with product and its function
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Fast-paced, good finale for the series of books on the hunger games.  Will be interesting to the movie to this one.<br /><br />Lori
B009LQKHIO|4.0|First book I've read by Jill Sanders and found it to be very good. It flowed well and was an easy read. Happy as well that it's the first of a series of 4 books. Looking forward to reading book 2 soon!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I was planning on doing the Maze runner series today but then I realized I had somehow missed this one!<br /><br />I love Rick Riordin. I made myself wait until I completely finished Persephone and had an outline of the series complete before I let myself read Percy Jackson, just in case it was too similar. It was worth the wait. The first few books in the series were all right, but It really picked up in the middle then just kept going.<br /><br />I was nervous about the new series. I didn't care about Jason, I liked the old camp, and I didn't think anything could top the epic battle that ended the original series<br /><br />I was wrong. The Lost Hero, the Son of Neptune and the Mark of Athena have been fantastic. I love the new characters, it's fantastic to see them all together (finally!). It was really great getting to finally experience Annabeth's point of view.<br /><br />I really love these books but they are also the few young adult books that make me feel too old for YA. Every time things start to get heavy, some extremely silly thing happens (monsters chasing Percy with cheese balls?). But I'm not then intended audience, middle grade boys are. Riordin balances the needs of that audience and telling a great story well.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next one to come out. Sadly, it's going to be a long wait.
B000HZD168|5.0|Great classic movie.<br /><br />Highly recommend it, as they do not make them like this any more.<br /><br />Nothing more needs to be said.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|I was really nervous when I heard the last book was going to be made into a movie. Doubly nervous when I realized they were splitting it in half because really, the first half is what I was worried about. It was really awkward and overwrought and overemotional. The weakest of the movies by far
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like this app because I need to know the weather but most of the time the weather is wrong. There is also too many ads. Other than that I use it all the time and there's videos to watch and pics too.
B004IYISSK|5.0|Tan deftly weaves together the stories of a group of mothers and their first generation American daughters in this heartbreaking and powerful collection of stories.
B0000BWVCJ|5.0|The movie played fine it was in very good condition and I can view it over and over without any trouble.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|And then leaves you hanging with a contrived ending that almost feels made up off the cuff.  Very strange.  You wind up not caring at all about the Four Horsemen.  Or the agent pursuing them.  Or really any of the characters for that matter.  For such a strong cast (who, by the way, all brought in strong performances), this movie was really disappointing.  Too bad, really...
B002GJI76W|1.0|The movies were on a format that did not play on my DVD player therefore it was a waste of money and time. Very upset because my son was disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't seem too put this game down!! Totally enjoy this game!! My three year loved the movies and this game just add too it.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Dr. Seuss' The Lorax is a very colorful and delightfully entertaining movie with at least one message for the world.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|I was not able to text with it installed, so I uninstalled it as quick as I could.  Never again.
B00CFYAT6O|3.0|This bunch has so much potential to put out amazing stuff, but these songs are flat, they need some EDGE,some grit, this one is just to commercial for me. I was expecting a lot more from this album.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|These are really entertaining stories, I loved them! I can't even put into words the emotions I felt while reading them. Great characterizations and developments. Hot actions. The plots are very interesting in a hot fantasy kind of way and the heroines are really awesome. I highly recommend you read this book. MUST READ!!!
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|Tears were running down my cheeks I was laughing so hard!!! It's really short, but totally worth it! I'm going to read this over and over this winter when I start getting cabin fever.
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|Yes, I did watch it first and it is a great sequel, not like some I have seen.  Most of the children or youth oriented movies have had pretty good luck with sequels.  This movie will absolutely not be a waste of time, had to laugh at myself a few times.  Great movie, great price, shipped very fast and arrived quicker than I thought. Great Buy.....
B00CX7OX6U|5.0|A beautiful and complex film about the tug and push, the chase and retreat, the confusion and beauty of love in it's varied seasons. It's serious but vapid, pulling you into deep and intense themes that disappear just minutes later. You have to be willing to let Malick tell the story though in the moment. Easy to see what's coming and tempting to to feel like you've got the story down, but then you know immediately Malick is saying something else too.
0142410314|5.0|According to Richard Robinson, the CEO of Scholastic Inc. \\"A great book is one that contains a simple and original idea presented with clarity and great power, one that connects with the reader, asserting its world directly into the reader's mind, one that makes the world seem larger and more interesting, one written with humor and light touch, and finally one that is a realization of a complete but very different world.\\" (Abrams 2012) Although many people have different opinions about what makes a good book, I think most of us can agree Richard has some very good points.<br /> The book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is about a boy named Charlie Bucket who lives in a tiny house on the edge of town. Coming from a very poor family of seven, who eats cabbage every night, Charlie has hopes and dreams of one day doing something bigger and taking care of his family. Soon a contest comes up to win a trip to the chocolate factory that everyone in town believes has been closed to the public for years. Mr. Willy Wonka has created a golden ticket that he placed inside random chocolate bars. Charlie only receives one bar of chocolate per year on his birthday, after saving money he eventually finds the golden ticket. Now he can go into the amazing chocolate factory with the other children and their guests. Many different wonderful events happen in this factory, and many lessons are learned by everyone. This book is filled with sweet adventure and appeals too many of the points that Richard Robinson mentions. The book contains a simple idea of a chocolate factory, yet there is so much more to it, the idea is presented with power and great visual aspects, the book connects with the reader by giving great detail about the poor family and the factory itself, it is well written with humor and filled with hope and adventure.<br /> Within all these great characteristics of this book there are also lessons weaved into the story itself. I have heard that the children represent the deadly sins, gluttony, sloth, envy and greed, but I could not find a source for this information. Although when you read the book Charlie clearly makes it out unharmed because he is the one child that appreciates everything he receives. Mr. Wonka realizes this and gives the chocolate factory to Charlie. This book puts a whole new twist to the old saying good guys finish last, don't you think?<br /><br />  Sources<br />Abrams, Dennis. \\"What makes a Children's Book Great?.\\" We have some answers.

B005HSG3U6|2.0|I was under impression that this would work on the Kindle Fire, but it is too big,, not a good fit at all.
B00005AREQ|5.0|I wore out my vinyl copy, trashed my cassette, now on CD I listen to it regularly. One of my favorite albums of all time. You must listen to Cause We've Ended as Lovers. A hauntingly beautiful song shows off Jeff Beck's guitar prowess that cements his presence as one one of the greatest guitarists in rock and roll.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My daughter loves it because she can play in the car while I am driving.  After the intro there was not much that she needed me to read to her.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|Very funny family humor. Some things stretched, but still very funny. Good if u have any kind of sense of humor...many belly rollers.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed out loud, I was annoyed an  I cried. This book did what is was was suppose  to, I fell in love with the characters and sad it's over. Perfection.
B00B52F278|5.0|this series has opened up my mind in many ways. This series is very adult, comical, and defined in every way! I love me sum Spartacus!
B00002N9ER|5.0|makes mounting your Maglite a breeze!  you could mount it anywhere.  I mounted mine to the seat rail on my Jeep Wrangler to keep it right at hand.
B004EEOAJU|1.0|I am a Supernatural fan. I watch reruns to the reruns. I am trying to collect the season sets so I ordered this set. When I went to watch the 1st dvd it set not readable in this region.  I tried my computer and it said the same message. Very disappointing! It is not Amazon's fault but the company contracted through them.  I did not find anywhere that said it was made for a certain region.

B000AHJJDM|1.0|First the LP is awsome. Love it. Second: dont buy it via amazon!!! I hate it!!!<br />But it will be the last time I buyed anything from amazon!<br />Im living in Europe. The edges of the cover is damaged and the imprint of the Vinyl is visible on the cover: signs of a very bad stocking cause the shipmentbox itself is still intact.<br />But the most annoying thing is that Amazon.com/.de won't give me the included autorip mp3s because I'm not living in the USA. And there was no note for this during the buying-process. And I read all the boring help-stuff for autorip. This isn't realy a question of licensing (autorip is also available in europe and amazon.de also have this album via mp3) but discrimination - because I'm not an american!! Getting less than I've payed for!<br />A very ironic gift from amazon is also a free mp3 for my buying. But its the same, Im not living in USA and so I cant get this either.<br />So I will never ever buy anything from this inhuman company!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Don't read this unless you are interested in your HEALTH! If you want to I erase your chances of not getting diseases, then this is a must read!!!
B00946WM6Q|4.0|Ian Fleming wrote the original book, and he got credit on the film, but this was completely re-written.  It was so different in fact that it should not have been associated with James Bond.  I personally preferred Bond's true nature toward women and how Vesper was treated in the book more than I liked the re-write to appease feminists out there.  That's the true disappointment of the re-write.  They have feminized it.  Next year, I suspect that they'll replace Daniel Craig with Angelina Jolie.  Was it a good movie?  Yes.  But, it wasn't James Bond.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I don't know why I wasted my time with other mounts up until now. I think this mount has exactly what just about everybody is looking for. You're looking for a mount which will feel solidly attached to your handlebars and that will attach to your phone in a snug fashion but will be easy to place into the equipment and get it out of the equipment. This does exactly that. It is impossible for this thing to feel more solid than it does. Though I love them now that I have for my car which is a different brand, having this has led me to buy the RAM mount for my car. I can't imagine anybody would love this.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Yup, it's majong.  Like sometimes you get bored with solitaire, so you play this I guess.  You know how you do.  Way easy though.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|Although I agree with the other reviewers that this envelope sleeve is indeed bulky, it's not at all heavy. And I must also agree with the other reviewers that it is kind of ugly, and the color choices are atrocious, but I'd rather a good ugly sleeve than a flimsy pretty one!
B00CO8TBR4|5.0|I purchased this CPU to go into a system running Solidworks.  Onboard graphics are not good enough for that software, so I installed a Quadro K2000 with good results.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|The typical werewolf and vampire stories are run to the ground these days, so it was more than a welcome surprise to read about them in a completely new light in Mortal Instruments - Clare has created a whole new way to tell stories about these guys, which I didn't think was possible. It was so nice to escape into the world of Mortal Instruments, with unpredictable twists, and easy to do with such great storytelling.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I was not planning to buy or watch this movie because I had heard they were taking the book and streching into multiple movies.  I broke down under the advise of my sister and bought this anyways.  It's a great movie and I look forward to seeing the next one when it comes out.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is full of variety, but I find some of the levels frustrating , which is a pain!Sorry for that.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|I bought this movie on sale.  It is not very impressive. If you can buy a used copy of this, you might enjoy it and not feel like you wasted money.  I watched it once.  Fast forwared through a few scenes.  Probably won't watch it a second time.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|One of the best science fiction franchises from Hollywood, in blue ray...priceless. Getting the new cuts along with the original versions is great. The &#34;Behind the scenes&#34; sections are chock full of interesting tid bits. I would highly recommend.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I caught a few episodes in season 3. I could tell it was good but I was lost for sure. Picked up season 1 and 2 throught amazon prime and am hooked like a junkie. The show provides a little taste of everything and is truely one of the great shows currently on tv.
1439190275|5.0|Well written and explains things well.  A nice update from the older books with better advice and up to date science.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|wow wow classic it is a great movie and I have seen it so many times.  Each time is a trip.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|This works very well, just snap on and connect via Blue Tooth.  Saved me from having to replace my bose dock just because I no longer use apple.  Love this nifty gadget.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Loved the way the story is to.d from different perspectives, and the way that it comes full circle at the end. Of course not everything has a happy ending and I kept hoping for more closure from some of the characters, but this makes it so much more realistic. Not everything comes in a nice near package. I loved the book and the characters and their struggles and demons.
0307341550|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, gave you a view most people don't see.  I kind of wish it ended a bit differently, but none the less it was a good book.
B008469DGY|1.0|This is a really fun game, but when you complete a level or try to exit to the main menu of the game, it freezes on the load screen. Killing the app in the manager does nothing. When you try to restart the phone, the phone locks up. The only fix is to remove the battery which is a pain in the ass. Hopefully a fix is coming soon as the game is very addictive.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Short: I grew up between 1995-2010, and this band (this particular album) is  classic. Lots of catchy songs, a lot of which you'll recognize, and some of the best \\"alternative-rock\\" songs you'll hear.<br /><br />Shorter: Just buy it now.
B000002GB4|5.0|One of my all time favorite bands.  This isn't my favorite album from them but it is right near the top.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|It builds to great tension, and it's very thought provoking.<br />High Quality and great actors.<br />The packaging was great, and everything was as it should be.<br />Looking foward to finishing the series.
0451239377|5.0|great suspense writer.  re-reading after many years forgotten.  reminds me of Alaistar McLean novels, full of intrigue and fantastic conditions.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and I had to own it, others who I let see it liked it alot
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love how the good the actors are, the props and scenery are wonderful and the story line never seems to get old or boring.
B002ZG999U|5.0|The original was better than the sequel.Every major action film star from the last 30 years in one action movie.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Easy to use, quick in clearing the cache, reminders when the memory is over-used are nice. I would like to see the addition of a landscape mode, since I use my kindle with a keyboard case and hate turning my head sideways.
0307279189|5.0|I am a slow slow slow newbie runner. Some would say that I am not fast enough to be called a runner. This book is sinspiring. It's a beautiful story of the human spirit and being a good (even if annoying) person. It's more than running but there are also great little nuggets of information about being a better runner. I loved it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game each floor gets harder not your run of the mill escape game.waiting for more levels so please hurry up so everyone can enjoy more mindless fun
B003O86FMW|5.0|Don't leave me hanging, geez.<br /><br />But in all seriousness I did like the book. Must read Mockingjay now. 5 star
B001NESPHC|5.0|I have three of Melody Gardot's CD's. I like them all but this is my favorite. I am looking forward to her future works.
1439152802|5.0|This reads more like her first two books, A House at Riverton and The Forgotten Garden.  I didn't care for her third book, The Distant Hours.  This book reads much like her first two books.  I would recommend it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a very helpful application for knowing about the stats about your Kindle. It is very detailed and you can set it to say the battery life or when you plug in a charger or anything else. This is a great application to have.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved all three books. Haven't been so excited to finish a book. Wish the story wasn't over. Thanks Suzanne Collins!!
B002X02V02|5.0|Love 99% of this album which is rare for me when I purchase a CD.  Usually I go by songs when I purchase rather than albums, but The Fame Monster was definitely the exception.  I am training for my second half-marathon and I simply put the album on shuffle and ran to my heart's content...moves my body like no other!
B00006AW63|1.0|I was very excited to purchase this dvd, but sadly when the movie arrived and I tried to play it, it couldn't be played in the USA. I have never had this happen before. To top it off to return it would have cost more than the movie itself.  I have a special needs non-verbal foster son who only watches movies with animals in it. Very disappointed.
0545101425|5.0|I loved it.  Suzanne once again catch my senses and imagination.  Unfortunately the series had  to end.  I loved it.
B0053KWDES|4.0|Bought this in conjunction with the motocomm thumper 1 helmet speakers. And I'm glad I did as my i-pod didn't have the power to run the speakers enough to heat them. Though with the amp it really boosted the sound and sound quality. It was pure rich sound with no distortion at almost full volume. If you want added boost this will do the job.
B002N2SYWE|5.0|Shipping was handled extremely fast and the product is in better condition than I expected. I've loved this movie/ story for a long time and I'm very happy to have received it. I would recommend this movie to any horror story fan that doesn't have a weak stomach, because this film is definitely not afraid to go where others have not.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|I have not seen this film in 6 yearsand seen it in full HD along with the extended edition blew my mind I forgot how great this movie. there is a scene or two that is just full blown that you can just see this green screen effect, but entirely the movie is great and long.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Be forewarned, this game is highly addicting.  You just can't stop trying to get the candy to the little guy.  If just to see his little happy face when he munches it down.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I love this app. It was lots of fun at the family reunion. I also took it with and the family and friend to a bowling party. I take my Kindle HD with me where ever I go, so I always have &quot;my Camera&quot; with me.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|THIS WAS A GOOD STORY ABOUT A GIRL WHO'S BOTHER DIES AND LEAVE HER HIS ESTATE. SHE IS GETTING OVER A ABUSE MARRIAGE.
B003TXSF5C|1.0|This book is just a mashup of all the popular books on physics and cosmology written in the past thirty years, dumbed down to the eighth grade level. Like many of those books, this one starts with Newton and then glosses every well known discovery since then. No, actually, it starts with the farging Greeks and even throws in the Mayans for good measure. We are even treated to another detailed explanation of Conway's Life, right along with the anthropic principle.<br /><br />I was hoping there might be one new thing that I hadn't heard before. No such luck. It's clear that Hawking had nothing to do with this, except to collect the royalties. I've come to expect a rip-off from Hawking, and this book doesn't disappoint, since it makes no original contribution whatever to the pop sci literature.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Good movie, i liked it and i watched it three times in 24 hours. Definitely worth the money and it's convenient.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|With wholesome family themes, beautiful vistas, a lovely and inspiring tale of people in the late 19th century. I loved it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun game. I like making sure all the businesses are connected and producing. its a challenge to keep the happiness rating up.
0525478817|5.0|loved every word in this book. you immediately fall in love with the love between hazel grace and augustus. unassuming heros who you cant stop rooting for. must read.

B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|what can you say  it's a classic , I love the west coast cool sound of Dave Brubeck , Paul Desmond is one of my fave saxophone players of all time so smooth and melodic  , but not smooth in a modern smooth jazz way , more real jazz and less pop and the extra tracks are great !
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The original version did not have advertising and was MUCH more user friendly. I HATE this version<br /><br />Are there any other apps that don't waste my bandwidth and time?
B008JFLWLE|4.0|I really love the fact that you can write it. I recommend it to anyone. If you have a hare time with fractions, then you should get this.

B001DTPZNY|4.0|He was only in his mid-60's when he made this film, which I have just gotten around to. It is only fitting that he should have slowed down and not gotten as physically involved as he once did (naturally, I mean the stunt men). Nevertheless, I found the film to be quite enjoyable and worth the time spent with it. The remainder of the cast did what they were paid to do, but none contributed much to be noted. Rightly so, since they were being paid to support not overshadow the Mega-Star. I have no fault to pick with the script or direction. Who cares what particular gizmo thing or process is being sought. It is Indiana Jones at work that people come to see and enjoy. Doe anyone really pay attention to the prize at the goal line or the story line writers dream up to motivate the quest. All we have to know is that something is there of enormous importance and it is the hero or heroines task to obtain, prevent, achieve whatever it is. I imagine the average viewer, for whom Indiana Jones has been a label for nice adventure not thrilling insights, will like this movie.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Would have liked to see them get together @ the end. It was good though. I'd watch it again ~ enjoyable for a superhero movie.
0684823454|4.0|What an interesting youth and man.  I am sure he felt he could never be injured during the War years. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
0345803493|5.0|Wonderful book, couldn't put it down. Wish there were more of them. Read all three in just over two weeks
0345548981|5.0|It is not very often that someone that is on the top of the world write book, most books are written when people are off their peak. Djokovic send us clear message what one needs to be on top of the world.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It lived up to my superior expectations after watching seasons one and two. It was superbly done: acting, sets, and plot, and kept me riveted throughout! Can't wait for season four. And while I'm waiting, I'll watch the first three over again!!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Is very useful, use it all the time! It helps me stay organized and jot down everything and anything that I wish to keep and remember!
B005SAP45I|4.0|This was our first movie with a villian, and it was a fairly mild one, which was good.  I am still getting questions about why the bad guys wanted Mcqueen to die, though.  We thought this movie was going to be anti big oil, but that was not really the case.  Lots of action, and a good lesson about how to treat friends.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I enjoyed this book especially because of relatives serving I'm the same region.  What a shocking education it provided. A must read.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My kindle fell of the nightstand attached to the original charger.  After the gravity challenge, the kindle would not charge without manipulation of the connector and specific positioning.  The new cable plugged right in and no manipulation needed for charging to start.  Problems solved.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|I watched every season. First was Blood and Sand. What a great season opener with the first Spartacus Andy Whitfield (RIP)! Then can the prequel with Gannicus (Dustin Clair)Gods of the Arena! You go back in time before the time of Spartacus. Then came the second season with Spartacus Vengeance. Liam Mclntyre premiers as the new Spartacus. Yet another great season of blood and sex and drama. Then the final season War of the Damned. A season thst wrapes everything up and will make you cry.
B00014NE62|5.0|Why do people reviewing this gorgeous, deeply moving film - or any film actually, ruin it for those viewers who have't seen it? The pleasure is in the surprise of the plot developments, so why such enthusiasm for revealing all? Hugh Grant is at his best in this, and his heartbreaking performance really holds the drama together. His last scenes looking out on the garden are wonderful. Everyone's great in this, it's extremely well written, it looks stunning, and the music score is fabulous. I love it. I did when I first saw it, and still do. It's terrific.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|If you are a fan you are surprised about how good these new movies are. There are some things that I am not happy about, but I can definetely overcome them. After suffering years of star trek deep space nine, next generation (it was bearable), voyager, and so on. I am finally happy and somewhat excited to see these movies.
0871403633|4.0|This is a book in which it is often difficult to know where established evidence based Science ends and Speculation begins. When Wilson speaks about the development of social insects, ants, termites, bees, wasps one knows one must be on sure ground.But when he speaks about the overall development of Humanity including the development of Music, Art, Language and Religion one senses he is throwing out interesting ideas without real firm evidence for much of it.Nonetheless he makes a very interesting argument in regard to what he calls the Eusocial Species, on the one hand the bees, termiites, ants et al and on the other the humans. As he defines it the  Eusocial species are characterized by a few integral features. As the author explains it, \\"members of a eusocial animal group, such as a colony of ants, belong to multiple generations. They divide labor in what outwardly at least appears to be an altruistic manner. Some take labor roles that shorten their life spans or reduce the number of their personal offspring, or both. Their sacrifice allows others who fill reproductive roles to live longer and produce proportionately more offspring\\" For Wilson this superior degree of social cooperation is what makes the aforementioned insects the predominant insect groups and what above all has helped make Humanity the true social conquistador of the Earth. But Wilson's choice of the mechanism for this degree of social cooperation  is at the heart of the major scientific controversy of the book. Wilson argues that Group Selection is the real engine of human social development while most of his colleagues are loyal to the 'inclusive kinship theory' pioneered by William Hamilton which Wilson once championed but has now abandoned.<br />Toward the end of the book Wilson speaks about the human future and the imagined paradise we can bring about on earth, if we are ecologically more responsible. In speaking of this he rejects Space Exploration as real alternative for the human future. A great student of the Earth and its living forms he does not believe it is possible for us to thrive elsewhere. He may be right about this but many believe that without Space Colonization there is no long-term hope for the human future.A great student of the Earth and its living forms he does not believe it is possible for us to thrive elsewhere.

1891252089|5.0|This book is great!  Each asana is clearly illustrated, with clear instructions for transitions between asanas.  He also provides alternatives to each pose.  The book has a spiral binding that allows it to lay open on the floor while you practice.  Each asana has the Sanskrit name with the translation, detailed steps to get into the asana, as well as drishti points.  I am very happy with book.  David Swenson is the man and his book is definitely helping my Ashtanga practice.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Good info but would like a way to remove a city easily. Having completed a trip. I would prefer to list a whole new set of cities.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I definitely recommend this series.  Even though the main characters are young adults...it's a fun and easy read.  Great for the pool or beach.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was amazing and gave great advice (mostly at the end)  this book shows, sadness, friendship, and joyful moments. Congratulations to this author :)

B002I9Z8I0|5.0|It's been a long while since I've watched the original movies and really enjoyed them all over again.  Makes you realize how far special effects have come in the last 20-30 years.  If you're a fan of the original Star Trek series, this is a must & a great deal.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|First of all, kindle edition is not the best for enyoing the photos.  I had to switch constantly to my cell in orther to have a better look at such important protagonists of this novel.<br />Well, we have this great idea -create stories for vintage photos- that couldn't become a solid narrative unit:  characters usually felt artifitially linked to one another or to the hole plot.  Don't get me wrong,  making peculiar people kind of non heroic selfish X-Men was wise,  but, why then involve this beautifull twisted people in a heroic well known crusade against same all evil fallen angels?  I arrived to this book looking for a different narrative, not to a disguised Harry Potter.<br />I enjoyed reading this book, but I can't picture myself at this moment reading the second part, though, I'll be expecting other books from Riggs.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The game is okay at best. The Constant rate me that shows up and sends you to the app store to urge you to buy other apps is annoying. As a parent I would be furious. Fair warning the pressure to spend real money is enormous. You are sent to the store whether or you agree to rate or not.

B007HUD6OS|5.0|Grandson loved it. Can read over and over again. Has other books by him. This is not a clutter item.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|This could have been an amazing and sad book. Unfortunately, it was poorly written so by the end of the book I was glad he finally shut up.
B002DFOXIA|5.0|fast cars car chases hot men and hot babes this movie is for you.  there is 6 fast & furious now but Vin Diesel is not in all of them.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|It has a very good story story line. Awesome movie! When does the next one come out? Soon I hope.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game looked weird at first but when I started playing it I was hooked I could play this game for hours and not be bored.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble' is the best .  Can't go wrong with any of his music<br />Have all of his CD's and they are all great
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|Even Star Trek V: The Final Frontier was better than this hot mess. It might not have been so bad if they had just dropped the Khan nonsense and let the story diverge instead of trying to mirror.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Couldn't put it down. Great ending. Great series. Loved it. Highly recommend the series. I enjoyed it a lot. U will too
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Again, well researched.  Great characters. Ken Follett has written another tome that cannot be put down. I will start the next in the series immediately.
B001EBWING|4.0|We like the &#34;oldies&#34; and of course, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are tops on our list. And we loved the other characters, the piano player, the local gendarme, Peter Lazlo. This one doesn't disappoint, no matter how many times we watch it!
B000EAT246|3.0|Great movie, I love the 80's nostagia.  Was surprised that the movie showed up unopened (was expecting as it was advertised as new), but everything was also written in French and the box noted that it was from Canada (this was the surprise as it was not noted in the advertisement).  There should be full disclosure on items especially if they are from other vendors other than Amazon.
B000I9W08I|4.0|Loved the music. Brought back memories from many years ago when we saw it live on stage and it was magic.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a pretty good game. Some of the objects are very well hidden and hard to find. Over all the game is fine.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I love working with this glass cutter, It works great.  It got here on in time for me to create some fun stuff.  thanks
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's fantastic. I use it everyday now for NetFlix and YouTube. Best $35 i ever spent. It was well worth the wait.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|Not your typical zombie movie where everybody is blasting everybody.<br />This is a intelligent movie and instead of giving you a movie with a big ending you get a movie<br />with the big stuff throughout the movie. I did enjoy it for what it is and i am recommending it.<br />Good acting, good scenes .. nice zombie acting and effects !!!!!
1609611543|1.0|This is a lengthy explanation of what he covers in short hand in the cook book.  I believe just another low carb plan with a lot of lean meats and veggies - not worth the price or time to read.
B000XCHQFC|5.0|I grew up with this movie - and unlike many of the movies from my youth, that aren't as fun or funny now that I've grown up... this one is still pretty stinkin' funny! :)
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|I was gifted this book in exchange for an honest review. Sebastian is a young man that suffers a loss of a leg due to foolishness and his desire to appear normal. All through this book you will see that this is a life time desire. He wants to be normal, not a cripple, he wants to be brave, not scared, he wants to be accepted not rejected and most od all he wants to be loved. His mother while appearing to be frail is a very strong overbearing woman who wants to be in charge of everything. How the household is run, how the store the store is managed and how Sebastian can be managed to do what she wants and who she wants him to build a life with. He must always be in control. The war is secondary to the actual story. I would recommend this for adults only.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The Best Super Hero Movie Ever to Hit the Big Screen.  Well rounded ... funny ... well shot ... character building... on and on.
0062255657|5.0|if you like the author then get the book. i'm not going to spoil anything. its a bit short and a fast read but that's not a bad thing
B00914JWSW|5.0|Great music - I have it loaded to my iPod and on shuffle. Suprises all the way around when a song comes up to play. Good choices by both the artist and the producer on this CD.
1563890410|5.0|read it if you like the author or the series. i'm not going to spoil it for you. if you want that go look elsewhere.
B008J34466|4.0|I did not like some of the language in it.  True love is my favorite song it is so true.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|yup its the super awesome collectors version. until the next one comes out and you have to get that one.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|A family favorite for many years now.  It never grows old and is suitable and entertaining for all ages.  Watch it!
0345442989|5.0|read it if you like the author or the series. i'm not going to spoil it for you. if you want that go look elsewhere.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|when i got this game I thought it would be very boring but now I play every so I'm say I love and its addicting kinda like clash of clans.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The large number if cards available is wonderful, you can build all kinds of decks from old cycles like zendikar and up
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I was a bit put out in the beginning and ready to shut it off but hang in there.  You tend to get drawn into the movie because of the graphics, the details and the quality is astounding.
0689835604|5.0|This is a cardboard book so very good starter book.  There are tabs inside for the child to lift up.
B001E9641K|5.0|We play this game a lot! Most games are best with 3 or more players, I love that they kept in mind that sometimes it's just 2 people wanting to play a game.
0307120007|5.0|Bought this for a gift as my daughters loved it.  Probably better for 2 and 3 year olds although I bought for a 1 year old.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Awesome book. Have read it several times along with the rest of the series, it's one of the best series I've read. But I have to say the the ending for the last book is an aww come on kind of ending. Love the main character she's spunky.
0140120416|5.0|Nicholas Brown has presented the grammatical structures of Russian in a way that is both easily grasped and is based on highly sophisticated analysis of what a foreigner actually needs to know; especially he presents a coherent explanation of Russian word order in contrast to the old and rather helpless notion that Russian word order is free and that basically all that one needs to do to understand any sentence in Russia is to parse the noun, adjective, and verb endings.
B009JZSFUY|5.0|As always the crew of the enterprize always delivers a good Flick. Wish they could make more. What happened to voyager movies.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Love the application, but do not want points attached to the weather app it is a waste of my time, also do not want travel directions with the app. Stick to weather and fix the problems that it has like it is eating the battery, the clock on the weather map seems always ahead of real time.
0062280228|5.0|This is a deeply moving, thoroughly engrossing read! It grabbed me, pulled me into it's world and returned me two days later, sleepless and completely in awe of what had just transpired. I love Neil Gaiman's work, but this, by far is his masterpiece. A  thoughtful and moving story from a deeply creative and masterful storyteller. Wow!
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Another hit for Grisham. Totally believable storyline very well executed. No less than you would expect from this excellent author
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I would recommend this book to a friend, but I thought the first half was slow. When it picks up in the second half it leaves you thinking, &#34;What if...&#34;
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It had a good plot and just kept rolling along at a good pace
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love this series. George RR Martin is probably a crazy hermit to come up with all the elaborate character development and amount of detail to mapping and location - blows my mind. When does book six come out? I cant wait to get my hands on another 1200 pages.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|With that said...I should say that all the levels where well planned and well laid out. My 12 yr old daughter loved it...was challenging for her for a few days...we really would like to see more levels!
B0073PPNE8|4.0|great movie. I had to rent it for school. So glad it was a movie that I had already seen.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|My daughter and I enjoyed this game a lot. If you like creep factor, I thought it was just creepy enough. The puzzles weren't so hard but hard enough to make you think. The story doesn't end here.....to be continued...<br />Enjoyed the game.<br />GREAT GAME!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Very light, and practicle. Can be carried around. It made me discover sounds I never heard before, in music I've listened for years!<br />Very convenient, and convivial, user friendly.<br />Love it!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|What more can I say...great acting, cinematography, compelling plots dealing with humanity and spirituality in a science fiction setting.  Women, who traditionally don't take well to the Sci-Fi of life, are compelled to watch the series as well...
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this book as a little girl. It was such a joy to read it again as an adult!! So many things I remembered and so many things I had forgotten!! A wonderful read!!
0380715430|5.0|I keep buying copies for gifts--it ought to be required reading in schools. I fell in love with Bryson when I read his 'Short History of Nearly Everything', which I also give as gifts.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|another great Panda game. there is more to do and it teaches numbers and letters also. and for older kids too..highly recommended

B00003CXA6|5.0|I love this movie.  My mom and I are big history buffs, so I bought this for her for Mother's Day and she's watched it over and over and over since.
B0063IH60K|5.0|FINALLY received download of free app after providing billing  info for &#34;FREE&#34; Version of solitaire.<br />Don't appreciate having to provide that info, but enjoy having the game on my Kindle for use anytime!<br /><br />Would appreciate &#34;NO&#34; commercials but guess that's why it's FREE. I would rather play solitaire than other games, but may try some of the other free games that work the brain a bit.<br /><br />THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.<br />Barb
B00EP2PXCY|3.0|Ariana Grande has an incredible voice, really beautiful, once-in-generation kind of talent. But it's wasted on this album, hidden underneath unnecessary effects, beats, and back-up vocals that usurp center stage. If you're a fan of the artist, I'd wait until there is a stripped down album. Maybe acoustic, or just vocal and piano? That'd be the best way to enjoy this truly luminary artist.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|There are enough twists and turns and surprises in this plot to keep anyone on the edge of their seat!  I was looking for something that could match the Vince Flynn Mitch Rapp series I just finished; Amazon kept recommending Brad Thor novels, but the first (and probably last) one I tried was thin and implausible in the extreme.  What a relief to find this David Baldacci series!
0321934318|5.0|Still using this as a reference book, would have a very hard time without it since I am a first time LR user.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Includes hourly and has a decent radar feature.  I have the original  Fire which is clunky and slow, but this app works well in spite of that. has a pleasant UI too.
078322611X|4.0|This is a film enjoyed by both myself (semi-fan of baseball) and my wife(indifferent to baseball, except to tease grandson who is a Boston fan).
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the most awesome note application.  I have Evernote on 3 different devices.  I can write a note on one device, and then pick up a different device and continue my privious note.  Love it, love it,  love it.
6304698798|5.0|This is a western that played just as I remembered it.  I should have always had it in my collection. It is after all the 42 ranked all time western.
0880796863|5.0|It is very strong and pulls people towards it. I was more of an Oracle person but after getting this deck did not even touch it. This is very pretty.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I've always loved doing puzzles but when I started doing them, the pieces always got lost.  These puzzles are a wide range of subjects and very nice graphics.  I can do them all day long.  From easy to very hard and rotating pieces makes it even harder.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|These chargers are great so far. Pretty solid design and look. I do wish it had a small light built in to indicate when it is actively in use. But super fast charge on my phone and tablet! I would definitely recommend this product!

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Easy to read, fascinating facts, and simple but powerful exercises.  What do you have to lose?  Just read this fun book, and give these truths a try!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|A stunningly raw and beautifully written story that constantly inspires one to experience a similar whirl wind of an adventure.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|She learned lessons from her prison stay that she couldn't have any other way.  It was a privilege to learn some of them along with her.  I liked her writing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i dont own this game yet and i still think it needs a 5 star review, it is that good of a game. only wish they would lower the price permanently
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Didn't like seeing Nick dead, but it was really nice to have a new take on zombie reality.  Nice ending.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I loved it I built a 4 story mine then red stone I dug it out . Then nothing I was like nooooo... then go on the edge look a glitch!
1451683405|3.0|Mr. Harris has a good point, but I feel he fails to prove it.  Skip the preliminaries and get to the point.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|Love the Matrix moves and originally had this on vhs.  Needed the dvd to complete my collection.  Had to have it
1781162646|5.0|A nice easy read that took only one weekend of my time. One of those suspenseful books that you want to never end.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Loved watching this show. Very intelligent characters, good acting, interesting plot every week, smart & witty dialogues. Go for it!!!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|we love the DEXTER series, it has great actors, story lines and plot that will keep viewer interested throughout the entire movie, hate to see it end in season 8.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Too hard to get energy unless you have lots of money to spend on this game. The graphics are OK but the objects can be pretty obscure,especially the collections.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Since I picked up a read that is in this genre and that I COULD NOT PUT DOWN !  I Loved it !  I was HOOKED in the first 10 pages !  It jumps in and grabs you right away. I was invested in all of the characters, almost within the first page page of seeing each of their names.  Holston, oh Holston.... That's all I'll say .... Don't want to give anything away.  Juliette, Jahns, Marnes, Walker, Knox, Lukas, even Bernard ... Solo ..... Loved them all !  I don't usually gush over characters, but I had a clear view of each of them, and their strange and yet not so far off world.  I couldn't  read it fast enough, and yet I was dreading getting to the end so quickly.  But wait ! There's more to come !  SHIFT ..... And DUST, HERE I COME !  And you can be sure I will be checking out anything else this writer has put out !  Thanks, deeply, Mr. Howey, for getting this once avid, avid reader back into the stacks !
B001F12J48|5.0|Even though this is a cartoon based story for kids, my wife and I,  loved it, enjoyed it, cherished it, and watched it,twice.<br />It's so lovely, the graphics are exemplary, vivid, extremely colourful, with high resolution HD (1080P) 3D format and the audio quality is astounding. (My home theater comprises of Yamaha DSP-A1  7.1 system for Audio and Video system is Samsung Smart TV 7000, 3D capable and Samsung BlueRay player BD-P1600)<br />I would recommend Polar Express, to any one who posses 3D capable Video system with a good quality Audio system.<br />Others, who do not have a 3D capable Video system, Polar Express in 3D will not work satisfactorily.<br />Thank you Tom thank you AMAZON.<br />Sincerely<br />KJ Kumar
0307476464|3.0|Finally finished this monster. In a word, you don't need to read this book. It is way too long and just doesn't hold up. Wind Up Bird is a very good book imo. I give that one 4 stars.<br />Murakami can write of that there is not doubt but it is just that here he doesn't really have anything to say. Redundancies are present everywhere. The first chapter had me hooked. It was a great beginning but about 400 pages in, I was starting to get annoyed. Skip this book you will be glad you did.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A truly great read that will keep you turning pages. Even though the book is long it serves to further contribute to the epic nature of this series. Enjoy!
B002ZG994U|4.0|I use to watch the A-team growing up.  They were good and I enjoyed them.  My husband said he used to watch them also.  I probably watch it twice a year.  I wish they would make a new one.

B00846REIS|5.0|Nothing more to say. Better than 50 shades!<br /><br />I am in love! I can't wait to start the next one!
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Kindle did not perform well with game.  Slow response time and had to press button several times.  Just did not have patience.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This card has everything to equip it with my FX-8350 and my GTX 770 4GB WINDFORCE. It has about 32 slots GB. Simplemete is an excellent motherboard. I recommend it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it is nice game. and I love it!! (&deg;_&deg;)/<br />can get fun without money.<br />samurai &amp; zombies 2 also interesting!
1579129129|5.0|I am very interested in natural objects and have insects, leaves, rocks and some animal skulls. I wanted this book to look at the beauty and variety in skulls. The book always gets friends leafing through it and they don't think I'm so strange to have my collections.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its really good if you like virtual pets then you should get this app but it is a little annoying having to constantly feed your horse
0553106635|5.0|always nice having the actual hardbound tome even if I'm listening to it unabridged on audible.com. impresses the heck out of my visitors.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book got me hooked and I've never looked back! It is no Twilight, it's BETTER! I can't wait for book 5! Bring it! I have hardcover and e-books now!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Never read the book until after watching the Cameron MacIntosh production and the movie. Definitely more information than either. And will probably take me the rest of my lifetime to finish. But no regrets.
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|When I was told that the Star Trek Franchise was being revamped, my instinct was to say, \\"Stick a stake in it's heart. Make sure it's dead.\\"<br /><br />With the the first reboot, I was wrong. I was consistently amazed by the quality of the last Star Trek film.<br /><br />But \\"Into Darkness?\\" Aptly named. It's just terrible. I'd like to try to find something positive to say. But there isn't anything.<br /><br />Khan was a tedious villain - but I'd put that down to Montalban's less than great acting.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />Cumberbatch - a great actor - is as tedious and one dimensional as the original could ever have been.<br /><br />But that's minor.<br /><br />This Star Trek film lacks one thing that every great movie needs.<br /><br />A plot.<br /><br />There isn't one. Just a collection of endless, tedious, predictable action sequences.<br /><br />The great ensemble cast from the first film?<br /><br />Forgotten. After all, having any actual acting or characterization would have taken a few precious minutes away from the 2 hours of chases, fights, explosions, and mayhem.<br /><br />So there's no plot. No acting. No characterization. We don't bring the main villain in until half way through the movie, and then do nothing with him.<br /><br />I bought this. Spent $15. That was a mistake. But I won't make it again.<br /><br />Star Trek is dead. It has been, arguably, since the Enterprise D made her last voyage at the end of TNG.<br /><br />Let it go, guys. Leave us with the memories of when this great.
0553103547|5.0|after watching the series on DVD, which of course is always better than any film/tv show. always great to return to on slow winter nights.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good enjoyed it very much. Can't wait to read the next one. A very quick read. I recommend it to anyone.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|This is one of THE best soundtracks EVER!<br />Absolutely love it!!<br />The way they've blended old with new is spectacular. The music rivals the brilliance of the film its self.<br />\\"A little party never killed nobody!\\" ;-)
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|I love the fact that this album contains a wide range of sounds and music from around the world. It's different but then again Gorillaz is a unique band. I decided to finally buy the album to use in my car's CD player.
B001EBWIUO|5.0|These days television fails to entertain even with the so called \\"Reality Shows\\".  It just demonstrates how the entertainment business can no longer be creative. Treasure of the Sierra Madre is worth watching when TV is boring.  I admit some of the background jungle noises was inconsistent with the area they were when searching for gold.  However, entertaining anyway.  Do you know who played the young Mexican kid selling lottery tickets to Bogart?  It was a surprise to me also.  In closing when all else fails watch this movie and the African Queen.  Both movies do not involve sex, drug use or foul language.  Just movies that make you want to take on a similar adventure so you don't channel surf 280 channels just to arrive at watching \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" which by the way is not a series about wood eating mammals.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy calculator to use. Great for difficult problems. I'm a fifth grader and this really helps,especially since I'm starting exponents,square roots and stuff.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game to take a break with quick and fun! Love the hint function so that I don't miss anything.  Simple but fairly challenging.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I like to keep my mind busy.  It relaxes me when I am stressed.it makes waiting time go by fast.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I love this author.  He is a fabulous story teller. In addition he brings outsiders into the life of the regular Afghan people. It should be must read for everyone.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome cooooool game, I get vehicles to use and upgrade by collecting coins on the way to a new score of distance. Who would call this boring!!! GET IT
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|Love, love, loved it ... action, adventure and romance. A roller coaster ride from start to finish,  a great story.
B009ME47H2|5.0|Very simple and easy to use. I only had bought the free recorder and was very pleased with it. This app let you record almost anything, then listen to it on the player. I am so glad I managed to find this, and I recommend that you at least try it out.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Each BOOK just gets better and better. Just CAN'T WAIT for the next BOOK. The next one is Waiting now.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Out of all my games downloaded, I play this one the most. I absolutely love it, and would have bought it for $5.OO to, if I had to. The game is full of fun as you try to maneuver Barry around zappers, missiles, and... well you'll find out. Also you can collect coins in the game to buy cool gadgets, jetpacks, clothing, and upgrade vehicles you use as super powers, and more. Best you get a lot of missions in the game. But I kind of pass them quickly. I recommend this game for you, a lot of fun.
B005PK553C|5.0|I missed this weeks show and was able to watch it at my convenience, keeping me on track for the season
B003O86FMW|3.0|This was so good I was of my  seat. The end was mesmerizing. I will never forget it. I can't wait until I read the next book!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I missed this weeks show and was able to watch it at my convenience, keeping me on track for the season
1451626096|1.0|This is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad book. Barely researched, poorly crafted.  Characters are two-dimentional, almost stupid. To be fair, I am no big fan of Tudors myself, no strike that...I actually, actively dislike Tudors....but even I could not digest the portrayal of Henry Tudor as the cowardly son of a crazy mother. Gregory has created a mother and son duo so vile that one wants to recoil.<br />I could go on and on and list all the deficiencies in this book (he rapes her before marrige, with his mother's consent no less, just to make sure she is fertile. She has to teach her how be a king, because all York royals are golden people pleasers dontcha know, The fact that royal babies are promised in advantageous marriages as infants comes as a real shock to her...who was betrothed twice, yup, twice, before she turned 10...)really I could go on. But that would make this more of a blog :-)<br /><br />Maybe the book suddenly changed its tune and became amazing in the last twenty pages, I would not know because I said my goodbyes to the comically evil Tudors and incredibly  brainless titular character long before that.<br /><br />For those of you who feel the need to finish a book simply because they started it, you have my sympathy.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I saw the first episode years ago and I had mixed feelings. It was interesting and either I watched something else or got distracted somehow. Anyways, I started watching it again 2 weeks ago and I'm already through the second season. Now I'm just trying to catch up so I can watch the current season on tv.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Dystopian indeed.  I couldn't decide if I loved it or despised it.  As David Ebershoff describes it, it's a love, spy, adventure, coming-of-age, kidnapping, and redemption story.  It gives us a glimpse into what life may truly be like in North Korea.  For me, it was a story in survival.  We all have coping mechanisms and do the most desperate of things if needed to survive.  However, we must ask ourselves:  at what point in the \\"stories\\" you tell yourself and/or others in order to survive in your own mind, soul, and/or your physical situation, do they become your reality?
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|I think that this is really an awesome little game. I play this on a Samsung Galaxy tablet 7.0 and it runs quick and smooth. Graphics are great. It is easy to start racing right away. I would recommend this game for download.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun bingo and slots but expensive if you want to finish collections as the items are much rarer than I would like. You can trade for the items through Facebook's which helps but upper rooms are require way to. many credits to play or high bets in the case of the slots. Would like to see the cost of the games lowered or items slightly more generously won. Still it is one of the more interesting games on the web and nice that it can be played on kindle.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|I have used this app for a very long time and fell in love with it shortly after discovering it! Here lately though, when I download an mp3 file, it will only play half the song I downloaded, then cut to another song.. it's very frustrating.. please fix!!

B007SGM084|5.0|This set is absolutely wonderful.  Very hard to put down and when you do put it down you can't wait to go back.  All 3 books are a must have so that you can go right to the next book.  The characters are so real and the feelings jump right out at the reader, and  I can hardly wait for the movie,
0062255657|1.0|Worst book I've ever read.  I was interested the first two chapters then confused the entire rest of the book.  I kept reading hoping there would be some answer to what in the world it was about - it was dreadful!

I have an intuition that Tesla also had a inner guide that he wisely listened too  If there is any written evidence of this, it would further prove our inherent gift of the genius inside of each person This book makes a wonderful gift for any graduate ready to change the world!
1451696191|5.0|Such a wonderful book. Some parts took a little while to get through but overall it was a great read. Charlie was so relate-able and really made you think about life in a different way
0741470314|5.0|This book is (a must have) for MJ fans, but also for people who just want to read about Michael Jackson, as a man, a father, a human being!!!<br />People who have a different opinion about MJ, please read this book and see if you feel the same about a man who has been treated so wrong, for so many years!!!<br /><br />To write this book the author had meetings with people who were really close to MJ in his last years. People like, MJ's bodyguards, his attorney (Thomas Mesereau) and some of his closest friends who all contributed to this book.<br /><br />It's mainly about his last years of his life, but at the end of the book you can read all about the Conrad Murray trial as well.<br /><br />Everybody should get a copy of this book and read it, it's really worthwhile!!!

B001U9BRNE|5.0|This DVD is better than the previous one.  I will watch this one when I get a new TV, to replace the one<br />which was stolen.  All of the artists on this DVD are top-notch!
B00821OX98|5.0|Just up front: The show has scary imagery and therefore not kid-friendly.<br /><br />Has themes similar to Battlestar Gallactica: 1) Survival, 2) fighting an alien force hunting them to extinction, 3) Military vs. civilian conflict, 4) the nature of humanity. I could go on.<br /><br />Like Battlestar, the protagonists live on the bleeding edge of survival, always a hair's breadth away from losing everything. The &#34;wins&#34; don't come often, but when they do they are strongly felt and are portrayed with great emotional depth. I find myself celebrating with them. The show can be a bit predictable at times if you're the critical type (my wife doesn't understand how I have so much figured out before we see it happen) but I never have a problem sticking around to make sure things turn out the way I suspect. I'm working my way through Season 3, and like Battlestar, the show is taking a different turn. I'm not prepared to say it's bad but it's thematically different than seasons 1 and 2.
1451648537|5.0|In reality, never finished this book, but first frew chapters are quite good. Will keep reading when I can find time.

Be sure to get the glass version which they just came out with as the plastic piece broke after a few installations.  I took the remnants and placed over my digital camera lens for great improvement in photo quality.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|So, maybe this works great for what it is supposed to do but I thought I could put anything on my Kindle, iPhone, or iPad up onto my tv.  Once I loaded it, I found out it can only basically do YouTube or Netflix.  I already have a smart tv so it doesn't do what I thought and doesn't really help.
1250012570|5.0|By the time I got half way through this book, I wasn't sure whether I was mostly in love with Park, mostly in love with Eleanor, mostly in love with Park's family, or mostly in love with Rainbow Rowell. As I approached the last chapter, I couldn't imagine how she was going to pull off an ending that wouldn't plunge me into despair. Then somehow, in the last breath of the book, she did.<br />Wow.

B00006L9ZT|5.0|From the opening desperate scenes to the closing trumpets blaring, Part One of Wagner's Ring, \\"Das Rheingold\\" shines with music, majesty, masculinity, and monstrosities.  This opera is soaring when it needs to soar, is subdued when it needs to be subdued and is mezzo-fortissimo when it needs to be mezzo-fortissimo.  The singing is perfect and profound while the costumes and scenery are lavish and likeable.  The whole production is earthy with plenty of raw emotion and yet other-worldly with much spiritual angst.  Although there are female roles in this opera, the overall tone reverberates with dark, brooding, manly Teutonic energy.  The offstage singing chorus gives the end of \\"Das Rheingold\\" a warm and angelic feel that is quite endearing as both heroine and hero walk off toward a distant rainbow.  With its emphasis on universalism rather than strictly German nationalism, \\"Das Rheingold\\" is both operatic prologue and template for the remaining three parts to the Ring which reaches its apotheosis only when human foibles come squarely up against the petulant whims of the supernatural.  This Wagner Ring production by the Metropolitan Opera is boldly original and sweepingly imaginative and will likely be cherished as an operatic classic.<br /><br />Frenetic orchestral music as only Wagner could compose begins Part 2 of his Ring Cycle, \\"Die Walkure.\\" In this production, the singing is both flawless and finicky and serious and sublime. The costumes and setting are ruggedly rustic and ruthlessly retrograde.  The Promethean sounds of \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" permeate Act 2 in this opera that reaches heights of grandiose greatness and depths of subterranean sublimity.  The whole production is important both subconsciously and subcutaneously as both mind and body become awash in this operatic opium.  Swords and spears figure prominently in this production as symbols of male, and sometimes female, power, leading to both ecstasy and joy in Act 1 and frustration and forlornness in Act 2.  The spear symbol dominates the conclusion of Act 2 as the lead characters confront each other with them, leading to the death of one after a struggle. Act 3 concludes with a return of the lusty \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" and a lusty onstage tryst followed by an all-consuming fire.<br /><br />Wagner's Ring cycle descends \\"dans la profondeur\\" with Siegfried and its chromatic character development and Gotterdammerung or \\"The Twilight of the Gods.\\"  Wagner moved heaven and earth to compose his Ring and Levine and the Metropolitan Opera move us with this smashingly fine production.in Act 2.

B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Watched this after seeing the American version with Kevin Spacey. At first, Ian Richardson appears to handle the role in a subtle way but as time goes on, he shows his true colors first as a member of Parliment and then as Prime Minister. The story will blow you away, must see the whole trilogy to appreciate the amazing actors in this series (actors I have seen time & again in other BBC productions, all of which are consistently excellent!).
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Its great to see this great 70's album back re-mastered. It truly takes me back.I reccomend it to all Beatles fans.

B005HEDI3K|5.0|The Doomsday Machine is classic Trek at its best.  One of the few episodes without Uhura on the bridge, the Enterprise has to stop a killing machine from a long dead alien race from going into the heart of the Federation to destroy inhabited planets.  Unfortunately, Kirk is off the ship trying to salvage the wrecked USS Constellation while the Constellation's commander, the sole survivor of his crew, goes all Captain Ahab against the Machine.  The remastered version adds great SFX that improves the episode from how it originally aired.  One of the ten best classic Trek episodes, The Doomsday Machine is a great way to spend an hour.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|This game is challenging but not too hard. It lets you play mahjong to get thru the hidden object games if your stuck and can't continue. It has mini games also.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|I've heard raves about this film and was curious to form my own opinion.  But as a great fan of Maggie Smith I was most disappointed in what I think is her least interesting role to date.  When someone is as bitter and haughty as her character, the viewer would like a reason, but none is given here.  Of the 4 main characters, the only one who didn't come across as a complete fool was Tom Courtenay, who plays her ex-husband.  Billy Connelly, as the randy stoke survivor, and obvious comic relief, even started to get obnoxious after a while.<br /><br />Sadly, I blame this on Dustin Hoffman, who was a first time director of the film.  The gimmicks felt like American film gimmicks and turned what could have been a great film into a mediocre one.  ( I really don't need to watch Maggie Smith say the F word, either.)<br /><br />The best part was the credits, because you see the older and newer shots of all the supporting actors, most of whom have histories in opera productions and orchestras from decades ago.  Now THAT was original.
B0096C7QF0|5.0|This is one of the best guitarist out there right now he has more original songs and there just amazing!  You will not regret buying this!
1451626657|4.0|Reviewing books is tough because everyone has their perspective. Here is mine.<br /><br />Before you read this, know that it is a satire. The general idea of the books is to illustrate the poor reasoning that can be present in bureaucracy, and many of the character use poor or circular logic to arrive at decisions. It is written in third-person omniscient narration (look it up, but generally means from other characters' points of view). It is also non-chronological so you have to interpret your own timeline of events. Each chapter represents a different character or experience so you will be putting the plot together as you go. Sounds like a lot of work, but I think you'll find it worthwhile.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have had several Sony headphones and these are just as good. Time will tell about their durability. Two more words required.
1579128149|4.0|This book contains a lot of facts you would read in grade-school textbook, but the presentation is much better. In my opinion, it fosters a deeper learning and maintains the interest of children. I would say this book is best suited for older children and young teens (age 9+, perhaps). There is a follow-up to this book, which I also purchased.
0553386794|5.0|Imagine a book or series of books that have everything you could possibly want out of  a story. War action, Romance , Politics, medevial history,monsters, sailing adventures,wilderness survival,Giants, Wargs, Dragons, Dwarves, and Sex. and that is just the first book. If you give the game of thrones 3 chapters you will be hooked. Five books written in the style of a dark Tolkein this American Fantasy will chapter your attention and hold it hostage until you finish all  five of the books. And you will still beg for book number 6. You just have to experience it your self.
B00AEBB8BA|4.0|Liked this movie. The plot is used a lot and here again is predictable. Mark Wahlberg does a fine job along with his supporting cast members. I'd give it a second viewing.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I travel with my Kindle and find that this case is well made and easy to use.  It allows me to prop my Kindle in different positions depending on where I am and what I am doing - great to prop up on an airplane's seat-stowed table for easy reading!
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|This DVD was worth every penny.  I've seen all the Cirque shows in vegas and paid over $100 per ticket, but this DVD captures it all.  Granted, it does not replace the live show, but in some respects it is better.  There are very close up shots and shots from unique vantage points that you will never get sitting in the viewing seats (underwater shots, shots from directly above, etc...).  The creativity and acrobatics are amazing, often times leaving me with the desire to watch it again.  With the DVD I can, but unless you are willing to pay $100 you probably are only going to see each show once.  The 3D is amazing!!
B000KUD2G4|2.0|When it comes to a hum in audio equipment, there could be so many causes.  This item might have worked just fine, but it didn't stop the hum I was getting which could be coming from anywhere.  Still trouble shooting for the cause.
B005LAII80|3.0|Extremely violent and gory details.  Everyone who watched this with me was disgusted and repulsed.  Other than that, the storyline and acting was good.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Liked the life lessons, would have liked a longer read. Helps future generations find their passion in life and provides the comfort that if something is meant to be and one is persevering enough, one can achieve its hearts desire.

B00CXQL828|5.0|[[ASIN:B00CXQL828 The Winery Dogs]]<br />Thank you, Winery Dogs, for a most delicious album!  I have been a long-time Kotzen fan, and any rocker worth their salt knows and loves Sheehan.  Portnoy, I didn't realize was such a talented drummer - I've listened to his other, major bands, and enjoyed them - but I didn't know. Now I do.  This album is just such an organic collaboration of these 3 musicians, all of which could have tried to be the main sound and ruined it but they didn't.  The music comes first, not their egos. Please support musicians likes these guys so we'll get more!<br /><br />The music is rock but expect incredible licks, bluesy voices and varying styles - including \\"classic\\" rock.  I could live with this CD only on a deserted island ...

B000OZ0NXA|1.0|ALERT...Spoiler...Spoiler...Spoiler: DO NOT READ AS I AM GOING TO ACT LIKE AN EDITOR.....I had such high hopes to learn something from this book and it was so lacking.  Reacher happens to get off a bus and walks 50 yds past his dead brother he hasn't seen in 7 years? Oh C'mon. He's a suspect in a holding cell but the Playboy Bunny styled uber hot policewoman knows he's innocent and brings him coffee and eyes him up for a good romp, which starts 30 pages later? He fires a .44 magnum and one guy is blown out of his shoes? A shotgun just gets pointed in a direction and decapitates anything in a 20 degree angle? (there are 8 pellets about 9mm in a standard defense load). At 6'5\\" and 210 pounds he's intimidating and kicks ass overnight in a state prison against a guy twice his weight and his boys just carry him out and leave Reacher alone? With a slew of people dead there's never any investigation as to his activities? I lovee a good, believable thriller. This was not one of them, sadly
B00D3ZJBEK|5.0|What a beautiful CD! Great songs and great singer. Fergie Frederiksen is one of the best rock singers of all times.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|I haven't had time to fully explore the app (ironic eh?), however, what I have is well done.<br /><br />It far exceeds the rather limited built-in calendar and Personal Information apps on Android. It also far exceeds the functionality and ease of use of other such apps I have tried.<br /><br />The lack of a fifth star is due to the price. (Yes, I know, I didn't pay for it being the free app of the day and all, but $3.99 is a bit steep for my taste.)<br /><br />After I have put it through the paces for a while I will note anything worth updating here.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Very well written, better than the movie.  I enjoyed this book thoroughly from cover to cover. It is well paced and the plot twists keep you on the edge of your seat.
0525952926|3.0|The story is entertaining although the book is not well written. Lots of &#34;See Spot. See Spot run&#34; type of sentences. I read the first book in this trilogy and was curious what would happen next. When the third book comes out I'll watch for it at the &#34;used&#34; price or go to my local bookstore. It is not worth the full price.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|good brain game fun to play when you have some free time to kill.  sometimes the answer is right there and you don't see it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|And I certainly wasn't disappointed. The characters, even though they're a world away are still real. You'll find yourself turning the pages faster and faster as the book progresses. This was a hard one for me to put down and you can bet that I'm chomping at the bit to finish the series.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved this book, the third one by Khaled Hosseini.  Like the Kite Runner, it described family life in Afghanistan.  My only problem with the book was that the action in each chapter took place during a different year, for example, 1949, then 2008, then 1976.  There were many characters in this book and it was often hard to follow what was happening to whom.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Picked one up 1 month ago and aside from setting it up I used it once at set up.For people who have a roku,xbox,ps3,internet blu-ray or any other device they use for netflix and other services this thing will see little use unless you just think its cool to send and control from tablet.The biggest let down for me was you cannot(and no plans to soon)stream anything from your android chrome to this from your phone or tablets,only the chrome browser on desktop chrome which really makes no sense to me.Google has made no effort in adding services or adding a cast from tablet,phone feature and there is not a lot of work in doing this.They really seem to want to lock this down to streaming their content only.Having said that for $35.00 I did get three months free added to my netflix which makes the device less then 15 bucks which is good.All other devices do a lot more and easier and better.No amazon streaming yet either.Google needs to get on the ball and soon or this will fail as quick as it got popular.............Had few months and have used it uh o times.Really if it wasn't for the netflix credit I would have returned it.Nothing major added since its release and news of other apps being added has since faded away.

B000QDA7OU|5.0|This movie has become a classic. It's a realistic story of a young woman who feels the call to the religious life. But circumstances reveal her inability to live that life. Audrey Hepburn is magnificent -- as she manages to be in all of her endeavors. I would heartily recommend this film.

B000FC130E|5.0|Great book by N. G.  Imaginative and dark and substantial. Richard our hero becomes who we want him to turn into. The Marquis, Old Bailey, the Earl, and all the other characters are magically sane in the insane London Below.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|The Richard Castle books are not great literature but this one was a nice breezy word with plotting that was only okay.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|A great book with the stories of all I missed in the last book. Too many deaths of characters I loved but I should know by now not to get too attached to these people.
0545123291|3.0|I read Shiver a few years ago, I don't know what took me so long to continue reading this series.<br /><br />While I loved Shiver, I only liked Linger. I was expecting something different, something with a little more action thrown into the story.<br /><br />Linger is purely a character driven book. It's all about what's happening to Grace, with a bit of a side story starring Isabelle and a new wolf, Cole. To be honest, I enjoyed Cole's and Isabelle's interactions more than Grace's and Sam's. They were more spicy, more dramatic. Grace and Sam's story fell a little flat to me in this book.<br /><br />Throughout it, Grace becomes seriously ill, and it's not until the last few chapters that we're told what's happening. And it's in those same chapters that a solution to her problem comes along. I just wish Maggie would've developed her illness differently, and also how it affected everyone around her.<br /><br />I also think that Isabelle's dad, Tom, could be turned into a nice villain, which is what this story is lacking. (Not a villain in a purely evil sense, just an antagonist strong enough to carry some drama into the mix.)<br /><br />Linger is a very sweet book, full of romantic moments, but it just didn't cut it for me, action wise. I have Forever waiting on my shelf; I'll see if I like it soon.<br /><br />(Originally published at The Clock Monkey.)

B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved this book, it was well written and intriguing. Like with any book the beginning is a bit slow and confusing but hang it there, its totally worth it! I would read over and over again!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Whether is is people lists, setup instructions for hardware, important IP addresses, or my wife's dress size Evernote is a perfect place to store information because it is available on my phone, my Kindle, and my desktops.  Thanks Evernote
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|My kids really enjoy this game. I like the different stages of play. The slow motion at the end is hilarious! Thanks!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|So far as I'm concerned, another FLOP.  I know many people like this, but I really don't.<br />I hope I can avoid these kinds of traps in the future.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Rango is a rare animated film that, while aimed at young children, has content that really appeals to adults. The overarching storyline is fairly bland, but the moment to moment interactions between characters are mature and often hilarious. Johnny Depp really carries the film, and the singing owl quartet had me chuckling at each appearance. It's a great family movie that adults can appreciate as much as kids.
B004EF65QA|5.0|love this movie great actors in love with armitage the kiss at the end is the best kiss ive ever seen the one at the train station
B000P6PVLC|3.0|Babel is a meandering, rambling exploration of the cultural barriers to communication as seen through the lens of four disparate plots. While interconnected in some fashion, the stories are fairly stand alone a la Sin City. It's worth watching if you're interested in the subject matter, but can be fairly obtuse and long for most viewers. Mostly average fare from start to finish.
B00CKWQN9S|5.0|Everything about it was good! Arrived quickly in very good condition and the description was exact to the product I got.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun game to pass the time. similar to subway surfers but i find myself playing this more often. cute, makes me want to see the movie.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|Is just look fake, exaggerated, unbelievable and trying to have the actor look and act like Silvester, was a negative impact on the movie.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I had seen the original before, and was disappointed by it; it was dry, boring, and Orlando Bloom seemed like this random guy who went from blacksmith to respected commander in the span of a few months. It was sorely lacking in background.<br />The directors cut however is spectacular; around 80 minutes was cut in the original, and watching this version one wonders why all the good bits were taken out before it was sent to the theater!<br /><br />Most importantly, Balian of Ibelid (Orlando Bloom) is very well developed---although the character in the movie is very fictional when compared to the real Balian of Ibiled, the version that appears in the movie is still very interesting. For the most part, though, the only REAL parts about him is the defense of Jerusalem, although his discussion with Saladin is probably not how it really went down when the surrender was negotiated (although the terms of the surrender and the reasons for the negotiation are pretty spot on).<br /><br />Regardless, its otherwise exceptional, and you seem to get a good understanding about the atmosphere of 12th century Levant and how the events of such led to the falling of the crusader state. There is quite a bit of politics, both in Jerusalem itself and in Saladin's army and court. The politics are quite interesting in themselves. The characters that you meet throughout this movie and these troubles are very interesting, if their parts small overall in the movie.<br /><br />Also, the action. There is plenty of it, throughout the movie; those 80 minutes added in plenty of action and story. The Siege of Jerusalem is also well done; it seems very realistic, showing just how difficult it could be to siege a fortified city in medieval times---even when, in this case, the defending force is largely untrained and small.<br /><br />All in all, both in the fiction and the reality, its an excellent show, and I highly reccomend it.
0920668372|5.0|This is the best baby book in the whole library. Not only for boys, but very special for boys and their moms.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I absolutely adore sons of anarchy. Every season every episode. Biggest fan ever!!!!!!!! I already have the season premiere autotuned do  tomorrow night :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  Some parts were slow and a little far to reach but all in all it was a great read, especially when you know there is an afterlife to look forward to.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was very good.  I wasn't sure about it when I first bought it, but as I read it, I enjoyed all of the charactors and their interactions.  I love reading stories about people that experience different things in life.  Not especially love stories.  This book really covered what I enjoy.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|and at low price of $ 35. and three months of netflix  nothing better than that  good buy !!!!!! c
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I've watched Amazon instant videos before on my xbox 360 without issue, but this movie would not play. It would stop to load every minute! Took over 4 hours to watch the movie. Terrible.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|tHOUGHT IT WAS A VERY GOOD BOOK DETAILING THE TRAINING OF THE ELITE GROUP OF NAVY SEALS.  i ALSO FELT IT WAS A GOOD ACCOUNT OF EVENTS WITHOUT BEING TESTOSTERONE LOADED AND WAS FAIR ABOUT IT BEING A GROUP EFFORT AND NOT JUST ONE MAN TOUTING HIMSELF.  I COULD SEE HOW HARD IT MUST BE FOR THESE MEN TO HAVE ANY SEMBLANCE OF A NORMAL FAMILY LIFE....IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO BE MARRIED TO ONE OF THESE MEN, THE FAMILY WOULD DEFINITELY BE WAY DOWN THE LIST OF IMPORTANCE.  IT SEEMS BEING SINGLE WOULD BE A PREREQUISITE FOR BEING IN THE ELITE GROUP, THE MEN ARE A FAMILY UNTO THEMSELVES AND I WOULD THINK THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL CONCERNED.  GOOD BOOK!
B0067R0APK|3.0|This app was a great til a few updates ago. The radar maps do not load on both my note 2 and note 10.1. Other than that it is fine.
0385349947|5.0|I highly recommend this book for a woman who is in her late 20's or early 30's and making decisions about her career.  There are so many things I do to hold myself back that I never realized-- even long before I had seriously started thinking about a family.  I identified with many of the themes of this book and am very glad that I read it.  This was very easy to read and follow and kept my attention throughout each chapter.
0449807819|5.0|Brilliantly written and extremely informative. He seems to honestly tell his readers his background and the long ordeal he suffered through after the Ayatollah Khomeini &#34;sentenced him to death&#34;. Rushdie is not only an expert on history but an expert on religion. This memoir held my attention throughout.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app,numbers are large and it moves smoothly.tried  other apps they were terrible.I recommend this to everyone that needs a calculator on there tablets.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love it so much it's so awesome!!! I recommend this to everyone. Get it get it get it get it I'm telling u get it now
B005HS00NW|5.0|I had ordered this CD to replace the one that was lost when I  totaled my car earlier this year.<br />I enjoyed it so much that I had to buy it again.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Beautiful Creatures is a good teen summer movie with smooth production values (no hand held video cameras or grainy footage, decent sets and stage craft). The story is predictable with lackluster writing. I enjoyed the performances of Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson: watching two noted actors tackle a teem summer movie was interesting.
B00004NHCC|2.0|Needless duplication of the same songs in different second-rate renditions are included (to fill space?) when new material or other Sarah Vaughn classic songs should have been used instead. Very disappointed.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|A moderately faithful remake of an almost forgettable movie. It's too bad the cast and crew hadn't invested their creative talents in an original script.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|SPRINKLE ISLANDS IS FUN and CHALLENGING I love this game I love the characters in this game  this game  coooooooool
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I was very excited to get this GPS watch as I had planned to use it for long-distance trail running. While the watch is loaded with many features, the user-interface is a bit clunky and you have to scroll through many menus to get to the various features. The watch does acquire satellites very quickly which is a plus. However, the main reason I am giving it just one star is that the battery life isn't very long -only about 4 hours and, the big reason: the watch quit working after about 25 uses. The watch will take a charge but the screen goes blank when you try to use it. I have followed Garmin tech support's troubleshooting procedures to no avail. Garmin tech support has not been particularly helpful and it has taken me over a week of contacting them to get to the point of talking about a return/exchange.<br />I simply expected the watch to last longer (I have taken good care of it) and am quite disappointed with it's (lack of) performance.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Love it I hope that everyone will try Big fish games. I play all the time. I'm not a TV watcher and this is what I do in between reading books
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|At least for now, Google Chromecast has solved our frustrating issues with Netflix Instant.  We have been using a particular Sony Blu-Ray player for Netflix which has received lots of negative reviews for Netflix streaming.  Netflix programming constantly stopped and buffered, and picture quality was horrible at times.  Tried contacting our cable company, Netflix and Sony - everyone blamed each other.<br /><br />So when this little device arrived I bought it, really just for using our HDTV as a monitor.  But the Netflix streaming has been flawless so far, and the picture far better.  Granted I've never tried Roku, Xbox, etc. but it certainly blows away the Sony Blu-Ray and has saved me a lot of aggravation!<br /><br />Since I'm now using my iPad/iPhone for Netflix the interface needs some improvement (on Netflix's end).  But so far, I'm a happy customer.
B001FOK70S|5.0|I love David Lynch and I love this film. I own most of Lynch's films like Blue Velvet, Mulholland Dr., Inland Empire etc etc, but this is my favorite film from Lynch, and I love it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|OK, so I won't add my voice to the global chorus singing the praises of this spellbinding series. I'll also resist adding some trivial criticism of the opening menu formatting (I found stopping and then trying to pick up where I'd left off a bit difficult). but viewing this series again and again offsets any minor concerns.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|GR8 GAME I LOVE IT BUT PLEASE IF YOU CAN SEE THIS PROBLEM I WOULD RECCOMEND FIXING IT BECAUSE THERE'S  LIKE NO GRIP WHAT SO EVER!!! ( well there is grip but it is very bad)
B009KYXEY6|4.0|good albums and having the double disk set makes it even better.  The more I listen to it the more I like it
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|This is an amazing album. I dont hear much of BMTH but this is just one kickass album. Hope to hear and see more albums come out.
1416549447|3.0|Seemed like good tips that made sense but it didn't help me much to avoid shin splints.  Describes good form for preventing other injuries...especially knees.
0140259449|5.0|Austen's stories one never tires of and her language is mesmerizing. Worth every moment of the re-read. Hurray for Austen.
0985557834|5.0|JD has created the best book for paracord enthusiasts. This book compliments JD's excellent youtube tutorials. I literally bought this book based on JD's obvious love of braiding and knot tying. I use this book every week and it has enhanced the quality and variety of what I create. I give this book my highest rating!
1416550534|4.0|The setting and characters evoke Downton Abbey. It is an interesting story that keeps you reading attentively to the very end.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|A very perceptive view behind the scenes into the world of recording studios that most people never see. Buy it!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Like most google apps this app also does not work and causes the Kindle Fire to &#34;Freeze&#34; needing the 20 second power recycle.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I use this tool both on my Android cell phone and my Kindle Fire for a quick view of my IP cameras to verify of any messages my monitoring system when I am away from home.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I love this pack of DVD because there many many great singer inside ! For the age the picture and sound are correct ! Inside there are some great moments and some time obsolescent but it's a good investment !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One of my favorite books in the series. Totally unexpected plot. I couldn't put it down. These books are not just for kids.
B00821OX98|5.0|My wife and I started watching the series one night a couple of weeks ago because we couldn't find anything we both wanted to watch on the satellite.  We were immediately hooked. It's been less than 2 weeks, and we're now more than half way through Season 2.  We both like action and sci-fi, but this series is so much more. It develops the characters well, and the story line stays interesting, and is more believable than many sci-fi shows.  There's action, suspense, romance, and even sociological elements.  We will probably finish Season 2 in the next few days, and then on to Season 3 if it stays as good as it's been so far.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing Just like the first book. I couldn't put it down!! Great series I wish I started reading it earlier. It is not just for kids.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great game, I wish they limited the hint button more. I tend to click on it even when I don't need to.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|I use Dolphin Browser as first choice on my Nexus 7 android tablet,even though I also have Google Chrome and Firefox on board, whenever there is a chance I'll need to sign-in to any web site I'm visiting. Because Dolphin takes vital add-ons like LastPass secure password manger and Xmarks bookmark manager. Unfortunately the android version of Chrome seems not to allow any add-ons, and Firefox android only a few less useful ones.<br /><br /> Dolphin also features the Dolphin button in the lower left corner that can be clicked for voice input, or for a new tab, or for settings (Each function choice displays as 3 icons that pop-up when you click the Dolphin Button, just slide to select the function you want.)
B00015YVDG|3.0|This was a good movie! I thought Mel Gibson did a great job in the role of the father in this film!
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I am so glad I bought this. I was a kid the last time I saw this movie, and I got to share that magic with my husband (who had never seen it) and my kids. Anyone who likes fantasy should watch this!
B00081U7HC|5.0|This was a great movie! The chemistry between Richard Gere and Julia Roberts was excelent! The interaction between Juila and Hector Elizondo made for some good old fashion comedy and fun!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The book kept me entertained and was a quick read.  I love reading the John Corey novels.  It is like visting an old friend, even if he can be a bit of a jerk.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|I came across this unexpectedly but loved it...also got my sister hooked and a friend. Lead actress very good in multiple roles
B0049J3RBC|5.0|My kids, my wife and I all agree that this is a movie that we never get sick of.  Definitely a multi-watch movie and a wonderful story.  Pixar is simply amazing.
1451696191|3.0|I really enjoyed the unique format of this book but some parts of it make the reader feel really awkward.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great game even though I got a headache trying to go faster than the timer! I will keep playing this game! :)
014241493X|5.0|John Green always does amazing work and this is not an exception! I highly recommend this book as well as &#34; looking for alaska&#34;
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very good book. Love reading books like this. Has a similar story as fifty shades of gray but compacted in one book.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|defiantly worth the money...live aid is incredible, and I really liked the 2nd version of the concert with brian and roger's comments as they watched their performance..
B00992CF6W|3.0|Won't let me play on realms it has a note please fix this I just got it and I'm sad<br />Please help
B000784WMW|5.0|great detail..but a bit too long...it took 6 hours to watch, plan to watch it on a rainy Sunday afternoon
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The story rang so true to me as an aging person who wonders whether anyone really cares.  To have it happen in a retirement center for has-been musicians was the icing on the cake.  I told my friends watching it, \\"If I get like Maggie Smith's character in my old age, just put me out of my misery as quickly as possible.\\"  In the end, of course, Maggie Smith comes through.  Then again, she could read a grocery list and I would think she should get an Oscar for it!  Fortunately, she didn't try to sing!
B00006JIA4|5.0|this came out b4 &#34;made in heaven&#34;.. some stuff is missing.  I only hope they come up with and greatest hits 4 with all Freddie's solo stuff incorporated into another volume.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|This production of &#34;Tosca&#34; was totally satisfying.  Bryn Terfel portrays Scarpia as the incredibly evil dictator and evil man he is.  Terfel is a consummate actor as well as singer.  I have never been so disturbed as I was with this Scarpia.  I wanted to jump into the screen and punch him in the nose myself!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. The puzzle was fun and I liked being able to upgrade my gear and weapons.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|In this game you are given various tools and you must make the ball look exactly like the one they show you. It requires doing each application of color/ texture in the correct order. I really enjoyed this game. It challenged my mind. I found myself starting over many times until I got each level correct and then feeling really good when I finally succeeded.
B00EJY051C|4.0|A good dpiction how how Linda Lovelace was drawn into the porn industry and how little she made from Deep Throat
B009MCRHH6|2.0|Others seem to love this game, so maybe I am missing something, but I found it boring and unchallenging. Dragging lines to create bridges is not my idea of entertaining.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This is one of those fun, good to kill time games. The only downside is that you can't skip any puzzles, so if you can't figure it out, and don't have enough coins for a hint, you are stuck and can't play anymore.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoyed watching.  I don't know how factual, but very entertaining.  When is the next season.  I am hooked
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great read, it pulls you in, grabs you tight and doesn't let you go.  I stayed up many nights into the wee hours reading these stories.  Buy this book, you won't be disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I got this for the kids on their Kindle and ended up downloading it on my phone. Only complaint, I have the Minion Beach on mine and they don't have it on theirs. Any idea why??
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I have to say Ive never heard of this girl until I heard from a friend about her. Then I heard \\"Next To Me\\" and I was surprised to hear how good she sounded. She reminds me of the U.K version of Tamia, but lyrically stronger. I love every track and I even have a few of her acoustic tracks which are also nice. Americans really need to get it together and stop worshipping the annoying 1 Direction and Rihanna's of the world and look at real talent like this woman! Top 5:<br /><br />5. Clown<br /><br />4. My Kinda of Love<br /><br />3. Next To Me<br /><br />2. Breaking the Law<br /><br />1. River
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|I received the DVD set within the time specified.  The set was three individual DVD's and when we used them as received we had a couple of skips.  I purchased a DVD cleaner and cleaned all the disc.  We have started to watch again and the skips were gone on the first disc.  I hope we have no other problems but will update this review on how any difficulties are handled by the vendor.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Just hearing the hype over this man made me go out and checkout what he had in store. I was NOT disappointed AT ALL! I couldn't believe what I was listening to and it was good to see a rapper speak about human conscience topics then money, sex, and hoes. I have so many favorites on here but Ill stick to my Top 5:<br /><br />5. Bom Bom - Its something about Instrumentals that really get to me and Im a sucker for them. I have to say this one really surprised me. No vocals or raps, just the power of sounds and instruments working together. PERFECTION.<br /><br />2. Can't Hold Us - I love the beat, his flow. His message. He DID THAT!<br /><br />3. Thrift Shop - This is so much fun to listen too! I love it despite it being corny.<br /><br />2. Ten Thousand Hours - Great Opening to understanding who Macklemore is. I love it. It reminds me of a track Kanye West would do from his first album but obviously more real.<br /><br />1. Same Love - Wow. Talk about a STRONG message in a song! This man tells it like it is and this song promotes Equality the way it should be done. Ive been addicted since I first heard it!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|A new version of X files...good acting... Sometimes gory but briefly. Overall really enjoyed it. It's good that there's a lot of show in prime.
B00B89WXYS|4.0|I have all there CDs and each one is different from the others and improve each time. This one is very colorful and its upbeat and easy listening. I like every song! Top 5:<br /><br />5. Life In Color (Bonus Track)<br /><br />4. Preacher<br /><br />3. What You Wanted<br /><br />2. If I Lose Myself<br /><br />1. Burning Bridges
B00280LYHS|5.0|Loved it! Great books easy clean reads and full of adventure and excitement around ever turn.  A nice ending to this series tho I'll have to admit I hope it's not the end.
1932735410|5.0|I love Mrs. Mulcahy's work.  With this book I am sure that I will pass the PMP exam on the first try.  Other books that I have purchaced have not had the detail and fine points to reveiw as this book has.  I am sure that I will use it as a reference book in the future.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The acting is superb!  You feel you know the characters.  Inspite of the time and place (1920's, England), thus requiring a reserved nature, you know exactly how the actors are feeling due to their excellence.  Can't wait for Season 4!
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|I heard good things about this movie, but my husband and I both thought it was LAME! The plot moves super slow. There isn't much suspense. It doesn't have a tightened up ending.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case came in original packaging, new, and is very reliable. It looks exactly like the one my daughter bought from the Apple store and mine cost less~! Fast Shipping is always a big plus!
0345529057|5.0|I absolutely LOVE these books. I bought them because I watch the show on HBO and couldn't wait to find out what is coming next season so I had to read them now. I love seeing all the differences between the books and the show and it is hands down my new favorite book series.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Enjoyed the Journey, had fun and smooth, visual , ride. I'm sure you'd as, a Sci - Fi  fan enjoy this Movie.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|love it great game coins ccan me tough sometimes but plenty of bountys out there although after the new update my income hasnt been working but ill leave it at five stars bc ive been addicted look for me out there guys im sinftx join my new alliance cobra inc peaaace
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Our boys love this movie.  They relate to it and totally enjoy watching it.  Perfect movie for relaxing before bedtime.
B00005R8GU|5.0|This was the second blues album I ever bought. The first was John Mayall's \\"Blues Alone\\". I was very fortunate in those two choices. After Mayall I got interested in the genre, and got caught up in the blues revival/worship that was going on at the time, 1968. I bought \\"Fathers and Sons\\" because I recognized Muddy's name, was just learning how to play harmonica and Butterfield was suggested as a role model, but, at the age of 15, I was blown away at how cool the cover was, so I bought it. Even though it was the first time I had been exposed to real Chicago blues I knew I was listening to something that was possibly the best of its kind. Art by van Gogh, classical music by Beethoven, dance by Twyla Tharp, architecture by Wright, poetry by cummings...you get the idea. \\"Fathers and Sons\\" is still a quintessential example of Chicago blues, 59 years after it was first recorded. This has the best work Butterfield ever did, \\"East-West\\" not withstanding. Muddy is glorious, stomping, shaking, waving his manhood, kicking down the stalls, singing his triumph, pain, joy, rage, all of a man. Every note stands up today. If I were allowed only one record for the rest of my life this would be it. Buy this. You can buy others but you'll never buy better.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|Settings Work well with my Droid razr and Bose.  My only complaint is no instructions.  Another review helped me get pass that problem!
B00BQ1D7BQ|2.0|Have always been a big fan of Stephen Stills and really liked the early KWS CDs that I have heard (which admittedly has just only been 2 or 3 CDs).  First, the tunes are a mix of covers and originals; with none being that great.  Stills' vocals have seen better days, and this is first time I've ever heard KWS singing.  Shepherd definitely needs to stick to just guitar playing!  Don't know the guy's named, but the CD would have been helped immensely if all the lead vocals were done by the guy on those early KWS CDs.  There are a few decent lead guitar parts, but pretty far and few in-between (I assume played by Shepherd).  All in all, a VERY FORGETTABLE non-descript CD.  If this was supposed to be some big \\"super group\\" that was supposed to insure big sales and big $$bucks$$, along with Goldberg and Chris Layton of Stevie Ray Vaughn 'Double Trouble' fame, I'd say it bombed BIG TIME!  Would appear to be a lot of potential there, but they need to go back to the drawing board and try something different!
B0030T1NAO|5.0|This is my favorite show on TV At the moment. Now everytime I see an Aztek I think of this show. Now that we're on the final season I can't wait to see what happens next. I highly recommend this to anyone.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I have played this over and over since receiving it. I'm enjoying the arrangements for piano for traditional jazz music. Mr. Laurie adds some details that enhance well-known music. The piano both leads and accompanies with unique rifs and compelling rhythm. I look forward to the next one.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this is the best jewels game ive ever played. I just cant stop!!!!! great game.  you have got to see if you can keep from getting addicted! my fav. kind of games :) but I hate it that it wont let me submit I just have to keep on writting when all I really want to do is play star jewels
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Lovely book, couldn't put it down. Well written and I think I shall read it again. Read it and enjoy!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|A Street Cat Named Bob is a very compelling book and it was very difficult to put it down.  I actually read this book in one day, which is rare for me.  It was enthralling to read about the life of James, his life on the streets of London, and how he and Bob the cat were able to help each other along the way.  I highly recommend this book to everyone, even those who don' like cats.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I only managed to sync it with my xperia z android phone once. Subsequent attempts either resulted in the pulse device bluetooth not responding or the android app getting hung requiring a total reboot of my phone. It does its job as a pedometer but without syncing with the app, I miss out on the analytics and other detailed info that the app can show.<br /><br />I just bought an iPhone 5S. Managed to get it to sync. I also realised that after pressing the button for 3s, I need to release it while the bluetooth sign is blinking. Then the phone app takes over and the syncing proceeds on its own. I will continue to monitor and see if the sync-ing continues well.
0375869026|5.0|I held my breath as Auggie entered the lion's den of 5th grade. I know how tough 5th grade is for a kid without any sort of noticeable difference, and could only imagine how it would feel to be someone with a craniofacial abnormality. Palacio brought me into that world, not only Auggie's thoughts and feelings, but the feelings of others around him. I loved that I got to have a peek into the points of view of so many other characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who could handle the reading level. My eleven year old daughter picked it up and has read it 3 times, she loves the book. I think she connects a little bit with Auggie, as she has just changed schools and has felt like an outsider. It's a great book. Get it. Read it. Love it.
B001U1V3RW|5.0|Great service and product! Arrived earlier than expected. Bicycle has always produced a first class deck of cards. A great buy to add to my collection!

B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Very entertaining and fun for car rides Keeps kids and parents going for hours on end Bubble popping magic and Dragon keeper fun for the whole family.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I liked the g155 because if you go some where and they don't have a tv or extra tv you can just bring it and play<br />Small, flat,  a little heavy but to me it was worth it
B00A6TYCNQ|5.0|It is the ultimate in ass-kickery this game is worth every penny I only wish this weed available for the main consoles
B009AY04A8|4.0|This is a really good game, I have enjoyed playing it, and have found it quite challenging, the only down side is the 20 second penalty for random hits, try zooming or just moving round when zoomed and they hit you with it.
B000002HNR|5.0|if you are a fan of the doors or music, for that matter, you would love this album. it is not transmitted.no overdubs. (hens the album's title)
B0025WX2YW|4.0|I really love a good story!  And when it's based on historical data, it becomes more real, more enlightening!  Kudos!
B009R659L8|5.0|There are actually three mysteries involved- whenever O thought I had one solved, up came an unusual twist that threw my carefully thought out theories out the window !!!  I'll be taking this book out of my archive in the near future to read again.
B003YV64OI|5.0|It is a wonderful product, for the price.  No issues and works flawlessly, all my sons games play with out issues.  Thanks AMD.
1250029465|4.0|This is a heart-warming story.  I read this in 2 days and recommend it to anyone who enjoys animal stories.
0684857219|5.0|Very thorough and descriptive read.  Bible of weight training.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is advanced or a beginner in the gym.
B0047E9TRA|5.0|This oldie is always a great watch.  Acting is outstanding and sissy gets revenge in the end.  If you have not seen this movie and enjoy fiction and blood its recommended.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|I thought I had read this book many years ago but after reading it now, see that my recollections of the book (or story) were clouded by the very inaccurate movie versions.  None of the movie versions come even close to this story of love and despair.  90% of this story has never been seen on film.  The writing is exquisite, although of another period.  I recommend this book highly!<br />Alton Gloer
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|What a movie, what acting, what direction, what a story of Love everlasting is F. Scott Fitzgerald's Novel and Movies in the first one with Alan Ladd, the second one with Robert Redford and the third one with Leonardo Dicaprio all as The Great Gatsby.<br /><br />The Love forgotten by a woman, who was to wealthy to lower herself to the level of a poor man.  How sad that things have not changed even in today's world.  We live for power climbing to the top of society and for what?  To be unhappy in a marriage of no true love, but a duty to their wealthy parents, and ancestors.  While the man cheats with other women, while is model wife does her duties to put on a show for the rest of society, as the perfect wife and mother.<br /><br />This is a must have movie to add to my collection of great movies.  I now will have all three by the end of this month and worth every penny each and everyone of them.<br /><br />Leonardo Dicaprio was and is a perfect Gatsby and as an actor is a young Orsen Wells, as actors go and beyond anyone's expectations he will accomplish much, as he is very careful what he chooses to act in, and does a superior job in each and everyone of the movies I have ever seen him in.  Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway, also chooses his roles carefully and will go far, as he has in so many movies I have, also seen him in, was perfect for the rold of Nick Carraway the cousin of Daisy Buchanan played by Carey Mulligan was almost as good as Mia Farrow in the second movie of The Great Gatsby.<br /><br />Directed by Baz Luhrmann, Writing credits (WGA)Baz Luhrmann (screenplay) & Craig Pearce  (screenplay), with F. Scott Fitzgerald \\"The Great Gatsby (based on the novel by Fitzgerald)<br /><br />Cast (in credits order)<br /><br />Amitabh Bachchan  ... Meyer Wolfsheim<br /><br />Steve Bisley  ...

B002M5E2DW|5.0|I tell all my friends to read this book. I watched the movie 14 times. It changed my life for the better. Simple basic rule...ASK , BELEIVE RECEIVE! Apply it to your life. You must read this book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story is well crafted, thoughtful, suspenseful - I could barely put it down. Can't wait to read the next two!
1416987118|5.0|Precious book. So glad to get an &#34;old time favorite story/game to share with our grandson. It is really a great addition to children's book collections
B005JABU82|5.0|Everything is great, just it is a little smaller than I thought, if your hands are big it might be little hard for you to build it. But I don't mind the size. This model is 100% real from Japan and every single parts are in perfect size and color. Just after you put on the wing the gundam will fall back because of the weight, my suggestion is get a gundam base. (I just ordered one). Then you can do whatever post you want with you gundam. It totally worse the money. Overall it is great!!
1590171993|5.0|This book was a total surprise, not my usual subject matter. As other reviewers have said, nothing much happens, but the trials and tribulations of the central character are oddly riveting. It is also deeply moving, his thwarted love affair and the injustices he suffers moved me to tears. It is a slow burn book, but definitely life-enhancing and ultimately strangely uplifting.
B006UN3K4O|2.0|It is a very good written and intimate book about  the major principles of normal communication with various examples. It is very philosophical one, not practical guide. I do believe that family is not the sphere where any guides may work. The only ones are love, respect and trust.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Bought this movie for my three year old Grand daughter.  She loved it.  Can't wait for Smurfs 2 comes out in dvd.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Really enjoyed the flow of the book and the science around running.  Since it is a true story, I googled some of the characters.  Sad to find out that one of them died.  I actually felt connected to them even though I never had nor will meet them which, to me, shows great writing and story telling.
0525953728|5.0|First hand account of the training, physical ability, and mental preparedness of these elite forces. Their disappointments, joy, and togetherness with their fellow troops, is fully evident.  I didn't want to put it down.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|I have all 6 of the Quest Hidden Objects games. They are so well done and the close up button really helps.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is a DVD you will watch time and time again and always find something new. The show is totally uplifting.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good game. Keeps me coming back. Just wish I had more time or better eyesight. Game has my husband and I both hooked and he is in the lead!!!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Excellent funny and moving  film. One criticism is that Amazon use the title ,The Intouchables' whereas the correct title is 'Untouchable'.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I was happy to be able to purchase this right away. It is a great movie and an asset to my DVD collection. Thanks
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great idea keep the creative ideas fresh<br />. Now just need an easy one for linear feet and square foot conversions as well
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I was happy to be able to purchase this right away. It is a great movie and an asset to my DVD collection. Thanks
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely loved this book...can't wait to see if more are coming and the movie for all 3 books!! Read all of them
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I was happy to be able to purchase this right away. It is a great movie and an asset to my DVD collection. Thanks
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Fun game...l am looking forward to some more games. These went by too quickly and l would recommend it to anyone
1781162646|4.0|Very interesting, hard to put down. I am enjoying it a lot. Stephen King does it again like we knew he would.
B00005KAQP|5.0|Whoopi is absolutely outstanding surrounded by a wonderful support cast.  Although this is really not convent life, no one should be offended by the jokes.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|First time setting up and using a streaming device for my TV.  Not a gamer and haven't even bought a blue ray player yet but thought the Netflix option was too good to pass up.  Unfortunately, Netflix is really lacking in up to date newly released quality movies.  For goodness sake they don't even have Smokey and The Bandit or some of the other old classics available, Really? what's the deal with such limitation.  Hopefully the Chromecast options will be increased and I'll be able to use it with Hulu or maybe even Block Buster online.  Looking at the Google Store does net some additional options for movies but again not the full range I'd like to have access to.<br /><br />With that said, the Chromecast worked perfectly and the quality of picture, sound etc is very very good.  No complaints.  I have one in my media room and will likely add one to my family room.  Can't beat the cost for the option.  With a Best Buy purchase you get 3 months of free netflix as well.  Pays for itself if you just watch a few movies.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Great as the first two seasons!!!!! Grabs you and keeps you wanting more!! What is walter going to do next??
B002WV5A9G|5.0|The JJ Abrahms version of Star Trek is simply great scifi!<br />Sure, it varies from the core storyline we all grew up with, but the writing, directing and pacing of this film are all spot on.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|VERY close to the book. They did a great job making it close to the book as possible. It's a great story and great action!
B004R13U6Y|1.0|What a waste of money! I can hardly see it on the screen and there no instructions as to how to use it!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I love vampire diaries! It's interesting, funny, mysterious, and it grabs you leaving you wanting to watch more!!! Dvd is great and it is awesome!!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Its hard enough to find a great movie for all ages without it being loaded with swears..and no imagination-this movie had all of it-good story line,great effects...giants weren't too scary..and there was a few humorous moments snuck in with the giants scenes..so my 7 year old laughed! She watched it a few times..as we rented this-but def worth buying for video library,,
B003L77GH4|5.0|The story continues! Great story, great action, great mystery, and still continues on grabbing you and leaving you wanting more!!
0920668372|5.0|What can I say about this book?  It still makes me cry even many years after first reading it.  Truly a treasure
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is great it has great graphics and you get to raise many rare and epic dragons you should all give DragonVale a try.
0399226907|5.0|This  again is one of those classics that shares a wonderful message and should be in every children's collection. Recommend
140006922X|4.0|I will need to read this one at least twice.  So much history and religious philosophy that it iwas very hard to absorb in one reading.
1623360277|4.0|This book taught me a lot of things about the acidic effects of protein and the fat connection to diabetes that I didn't know. It has lots of low fat recipes to get you started on meatless meals. The only drawback is that it relies heavily on tofu and other soy products to make creamy sauces and dressings and as a cancer survivor, I should avoid soy. However, in two weeks, I've lost five pounds. So if that is your goal, this plan works..
B009GXHOW4|5.0|i love this editor its awesome cause i can get what i want like get me so.e diamonds haha me some diamonds but ya i can get some diamonds because they only generate like up to sixteen in one world seed is ONE DIRECTION &lt;3 i think it was for the .6 and not .7 but ya i love this thing so get it.
B00AOQ8KCU|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Bank Robbing movies are the best, and this is a good example of them. Funny when it needs to be, and serious when it needs to be.
B000V86OKG|5.0|We are huge fans of Dexter! It's the only time I will stay up past midnight on a &#34;school night&#34;, to watch an entire Season in one seating!!
1575666286|5.0|I may have to consider Chemotherapy...there's a lot of information in this book for deciding if that is what I want to do or not.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I purchased this album for my husband who is a huge QOTSA fan. When Daddy's happy,  you know I'm happy!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I was happily using this app but it recently updated and all of a sudden the dimming feature stopped working. It's way too bright for the digital clock to display at night on a bedstand IMO. In any case why does this feature not work anymore? I cannot use it anymore because of this.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Samsung Note 2<br />4.2
B00C061I3K|5.0|This was a gift I made for a friend, so I said it's a good albun, highly recommended in comparison to earlier daft punk stuff is much calmer
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Vonnegut has one of the most indescribably fantastic writing styles I've ever read. Most definitely will read more by him!
B001V7SME2|5.0|This is not only my favorite horror movie, but it is my favorite movie overall. The connection between Oskar and Eli is one that brings me back to my childhood. I have seen the movie four times and still want to watch it again. I am reading the book now. I would recomend this movie to any one who likes horror movies that have more substance and depth then most.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|I would recommend this to any Studio Ghibli fan.  Most Studio Ghibli movies are backed with great English dubs, but I've heard that they didn't get a very good cast this time.  I watched this one with subtitles and the original audio and I would recommend the same.
0743270754|5.0|As I neared completion of this book, I proceeded with dread, knowing that it would end with Lincoln's assassination. And as expected, following the 700 plus page buildup of the story about Lincoln's kindness, humanity and outstanding leadership skills, it was difficult to read about the conspiracy that led to his murder. I was also profoundly disappointed to learn that Lincoln was left so unprotected when his administration was clearly aware of the risks to his life. In the end, I'm left to wonder how the world might look different today, had Lincoln lived to lead the nation's reconstruction efforts. The outcome would surely have been different had Andrew Johnson, who opposed the Fourteenth Amendment and was ultimately impeached, not ascended to the presidency.<br /><br />Now that I've finished reading Team of Rivals, my conclusion is that this important novel is a must read for every American. Although it's a thick book that starts out slow, it is quite readable and it engaged me throughout. There were also lots of revelations about that time, the fascinating people (on both sides of the conflict) and the events that occurred. I especially loved reading about Lincoln's thoughts and strategy pertaining to the emancipation proclamation. Doris Kearns Goodwin is such a talented writer that throughout the reading, I felt as though I was right there with Lincoln and his cabinet, watching and listening intently, marveling at Lincoln's leadership and intelligence. I highly recommend this book.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I play this with my 4 year old son and we both have a blast, it really makes you use your brains ;)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the first game like this I have played on my Kindle Fire.  I was hooked from the beginning.  The puzzles are intriguing and challenging and kept me going, trying to figure out the solutions.  The best part of this game is the hint factor.  You are subtly directed where you should look next without giving away the answer.  There were some puzzles that had me getting a bit frazzled and then I would rethink the clue, rotate the Kindle, use the eyepiece and just keep trying until the solution appeared.  Very satisfying.  I am using my brain and having fun at the same time which is a perfect combination.  I am anxious for the sequel which should be coming soon.  This game reminds me of the Myst games I played on my computer years ago.
B00CLOTNLK|5.0|Beginning to end, this album is an artfully-crafted joy to listen to. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of progressive rock in general, and especially to those partial to older Genesis and Pink Floyd.
B000059MEK|5.0|Has to be one of their best albums and definitely an excellent starter Daft Punk album for people that want to start listening them.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|So much fun and very challenging<br />I couldn't put it down.  I kept coming back to<br />it again and again.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Some of the songs have what I've come to think of as Train's unique sound, others have a new fresh style.  Loving it.  Waiting on the next album.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I just love this app when I go to sleep love it and it's for free sweet you need to get this now
030758836X|4.0|What else can I say. This is not my usual taste in books but I have to admit it was quite a mystery!
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|Why must it be so hard to steer? I get you have to drift into the turns, but this is like driving in snow with only rear breaks and bald back tires. I've tried every steering option and they all control equally bad. Needs a sensitivity setting or something. Otherwise it seems like it would be a very good game.
B004LROUW2|5.0|Murakami is part novelist, part musician, part magician. If Tolstoy wrote a mixture of fantasy and mystery, it would read something like this.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Great new tunes...great sound...whole lotta voice!  I loved this whole CD, there were just two songs I didn't really enjoy, so out they went...but Some Nights has got rhythm!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The blu ray transfer of these movies was done very well.  You already know the movies are great so enough said.
B001R10BEG|5.0|I like to get these classics...they just make me feel good.  Like Sound of Music and Hello Dolly, this movie is also &#34;timeless&#34; in its appeal.  Plus, it came out in the early 80's and I love those streamlined suits the women would wear back then.  Go shoulder-pads!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Entertaining with action and humor. Worth a couple bucks when you can't find anything on television. If I had known how good it was I would have watched it sooner.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game,then my settlement got crossed with someone else's.waited a few months downloaded again but this time it just freezes my kindle. great game if you want to loose your hard work ..eventually
0375847227|5.0|Gives a complete view into the world of Lyra and her daemon, and the  fascinating world where animals are sentient.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|It is a great mouse.  I like having the ability to rapidly change the sensitivity and motion of the mouse.  The software didn't automatically start when I plugged it into the USB port, but they have everything on the website.  The software is almost as much fun to play with as any game you can play with this mouse.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Al tho I thought I would have a blast wit this, I bought this mostly cause i loved doctor who and the sonic was a must get.  Then I thought.  Since its a pen, i could carry it everywhere and still have a reason for bringing it.  But i was wrong.  Before I say why, when you get it.  If you are not planning on using the UV nib, then crazy glue in the ink nib. Trust me, the UV nib is crap.  It barely shows up.  Your better off writing very faintly with a highlighter.  Showed up 200% better.  Anyway, I super glued mines in that I %100 do not regret, if your thinking your will regret doing this you wouldn't.  It will not come of, it will look nice, you can carry it around without fear the bottom will fall out.  (which it always did), and makes it a decent pen.  Since before you glue it. You had to grab the ink nib and write not the sonic otherwise if you pressed to hard it would fall out.  Well, back to the begging.  I thought, now its a good pen.  But... Well i suppose id be AN EXCELLENT take around pen if your NOT IN SCHOOL OR COLLEGE.  NOTE THAT.  The only reason y i find i don't take it to school, is that if it makes noises in class, teacher will take it.  People would fight to see it. And well, if you do get it back, it will have scratches and battle scars.  So....I put although of vary stuff in here.  I know you have those certain questions before buying.  Hope I answers them.  And btw, if you were also planning to buy the 11th sonic too at some point.  Buy em both at the same time.  Trust me .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love hoover boards and the mystery boxes and how you can change outfits and how you can make the policemen jump whenever you
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Really enjoyed this book and could not stop reading. Beautifully written and very touching, would certainly recommend reading this book.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|It was amazing.....best book and tv series.... I Love the walking dead I'd rather watch it or read it than anything
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|A very clever and entertaining science fiction TV series that is full of twists & turns and interesting characters!  Check it out!
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld arrived very fast!  I was delighted that I was able to share this with my husband sooner than I thought.  He is now a seinfeld fan too!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|The &#34;Bones&#34; collection by Kathy Reichs is really worth the read.  If forensics is what you enjoy, these books will keep you reading one after the other.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME ! BUT I WOULD TAKE A STAR FOR SOME STUFF. BUT I THINK THEY SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER ONE. THIS IS A REALLY COOL GAME. IN CAMPAIGN OR MULTIPLAYER MODE. GUNS GRENADE AND PISTOL. MY NAME IS ELI I HOPE I HELPED
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and had everything I needed. Downloaded quickly and so far hasn't had a bunch of annoying updates. I hats it when every time I go to use a program it has to update...especially programs that are made to do something simple like a calculator.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought the Chromecast for 4 reasons:<br />1.  streaming Netflix from smart phones to TV at home or while travelling because its so portable<br />2.  I purchased the Madden 25 anniversary edition with NFL Sunday Ticket streaming and use my laptop to send the game stream to my TV.  I used it all day yesterday and it worked much better than I expected.<br />3.  the SDK, when its released, will allow all my favorite apps to stream.  Once my Plex app adds Chromecast support I will be in nerd nirvana.<br />4.  My wife likes iPhone, I like Android.  We are both able to use Chromecast as well as stream from our laptops.  A feature I love but wasn't aware of is the ability to Cast my entire desktop.<br /><br />The Chromecast is fantastic now and its only going to get better.
160774273X|5.0|Who knew there was so much to learn about bread.  Great book and resource.  Purchased for husband but I use it too.
B005QBBCMI|4.0|Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue are GREAT is this dark, sad, tragic story.  Cage/s downward spiral is convincing and complelling
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Really nice clock. Wakes you up on time and can be set for everyday or once a week. Try it you will love it as I do
B000EXZI1O|5.0|I'm glad this album is out on cd. I wore out my lp back in the day. I must have played it at least 3 times a day everyday all throughout the summer of 1979. Some folks criticized the Bee Gees particularly for putting Robin's vocals on the back burner for this album and for the Saturday Night Fever songs. But Barry's falsetto was just working for them at the time, and they did bring Robin's lead vocals back in a very big way with their next album, Living Eyes.<br /><br />This album of course has many songs that are danceable and that are R&B influenced, but it by no means is a \\"disco\\" album. There are beautiful ballads, like Stop (Think Again) which also features the horn section from the band Chicago, Reaching Out, Until, which highlights Barry's lower register, and of course the big ballad hit from this album, Too Much Heaven. I'm Satisfied is pretty much a full on reggae song. Just lots of really fun stuff on this album, flawless production, and great voices in perfect harmony.
B000088SYA|5.0|i never that i grow up with listening to some of there songs but did not know the names of the songs or the group.  two of the songs are downunder and who can it be now.  the songs are nice and crisp.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan's book fills an important void for me -- a book that can give great and concise political, economic, social, philosophical, historical and religious background to the period of Jesus' life and that of the very early followers of Jesus. Teaching courses on the Acts of the Apostles or the Letters/Epistles of Paul, I often find the class grinding to a halt, as someone gets confused about the divergent groups within Judaism. This book covers that and a lot more. From the discussion over what a messiah is to a survey of apocalyptic perspectives in Judaism under Roman occupation, this book conveys the essential information. Last, but not least, Aslan constantly asks the reader to compare the historical Jesus with the Christological Jesus and see what comes from that comparison.<br /><br />Whether one agrees with some or all of Aslan's interpretations, the author does us a great service by providing such a concise and well-written survey.
B00C28J2VQ|4.0|I was wondering how the 3d effect and I was very satisfied with the outcome. It was really an action movie. I like it.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|The first one was more exciting.  This one was good, but I felt it needed something else.  Overall good movie however.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|I bought the digital version from Amazon and it always plays nicely with no stops or buffering.  I've watched this one over and over with my little one (you know how that goes) and could watch it over and over some more (can't say that for many of them).  The premise of this movie is that our mythical icons such as Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy are actually real and they protect the children of the world.  My little one talks about the Sandman now when she knew nothing about him before. My favorite part every time watching with her is when they win over darkness and the Sandman makes some beautiful, golden creatures for the children like full-size dinosaurs walking through town and every time my daughter squeals &#34;DINOSAURS!&#34;  So great.  Try this one if you haven't. I think you'll like it, even if you don't have a little one to add extra enjoyment.
B005Z9MH98|5.0|Such a wonderful blast from my past! Everything you would expect from an 80s classic. I highly recommend this movie.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|My husband and I rented this one through Amazon. It streamed beautifully with no problems at all.  If you like action flicks, and liked the first movie, this one is a good choice.  There are some pretty amazing fighting sequences here.  Recommended.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|Need to have better sound that are louder so that people can wake up which would  make it more affective
0545265355|5.0|I bought this boxed set for my teenager and it's a really nice set.  I highly recommend this series of books. They were the first in a very long time that I literally couldn't put down and then couldn't wait to pick up the next book in the series.  I know they've been hyped quite a lot but they really are that good.  Plus, I recommend you read them before seeing the movie(s).
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|Finally got to see this move! I liked it as well as the 2013 movie! the 1974 movie was more subtle. Not ass crazy and fast pace!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I never read Jack Reacher novels, so I didn't know what to expect...and I am glad of that.  I think Tom Cruise makes a great Jack Reacher, and if I had read the novel I would have thought Cruise too short and too handsome.  But Reacher's real talent is his power - physical and intellectual.  Cruise does this well. He is the Lone Guy who sees a puzzle, fits the pieces together, measure the risk and reward and operates with Full Confidence.<br /><br />Seeing this movie led me to read a Reacher novel...my first one \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\"  Yep, I am a Reacher fan.<br /><br />I am not sure if this did well at the box office...I hope it did because I would like to see more of Cruise as Reacher.
B0036UMM84|5.0|5 stars. awesome movie! it took me 37 years to finally see this movie. now I own it! yay Horray!
1597770736|3.0|Good book but it's sad that the MOVIE is longer than this book...or maybe they should just call this the footnotes edition.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|As we're both from the same part of the northeast in England (though I live in Chicago now), I devour anything Sting produces.  I loved this recording though I feel it is a bit over-orchestrated.  The song election are great, and the warmth of Sting's personality is evident.
B00CUKTG2Q|1.0|I was really looking forward to this! After listening to it I have come to the conclusion that I had been had. This CD is lazy and uninspired...that's basically it.<br />There wasn't a single thought behind the lyrics or the music.<br /><br />Pro:<br />only wasted $10 (could of been lunch)
0307472841|5.0|From the creator of the Wallander series, this time he lends his craft to a brilliant thriller set in northern wede and, of all places, China, with an intermediate top in Africa.  Wow, what a read!
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|Fairly entertaining kind of Robinhood story.  Nice twist that I personally didn't see coming.  Person who watched the movie with me said it reminded them of a movie made for kids.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game is Okay. Not as entertaining as the Gems Journey, but OK. It is bigger then my screen on the Kindle Fire, so hard to tell where to shoot the Angry Bird.
B0013K1ALO|5.0|An outstanding piece of the art of the ultimate rock movie ever. A real super gonzo collector's box for every true Led Zeppelin fan. Grab the thing, put it in the dvd reader, turn the volume to 11... and bring the roof down.<br />The Song Remains the Same indeed! Rock and Roll at its best.<br />Superb
B0040I09RM|5.0|I was very annoyed with myself for missing this show during its initial run on FX.  However, I'm glad to catch up now.  I'm only about half way through the first season, but I'm totallly hooked.  The characters and story lines are very interesting and the violence (while graphic) is contextually appropriate.  With all grabage currently on TV, this show is a gem.  Also, gotta love the jacket!!!!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Absolutely fabulous. Of the many performances of this musical this is the best I have seen, perhaps because it can be viewed many times - and up close on the performers . Quite different from sitting in the audience trying to make sure you have taken in everything in the scene.
B00BS6WRPG|5.0|Such an original sound.<br />It disappoints me that Jamie Cullum is not more mainstream, especially in the states.<br />I've seen him live, and this 5'2\\"/5'3\\" had a POWERFUL voice, coupled with fantastic piano playing and very good writing.<br />He is truly an artist. This is yet another GREAT album.<br />\\"When I get famous\\" is my current favorite.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I'm extremely pleased I got this particular display calibrator. It works on laptops, desktops, and macs no problem. If you ever need the CD their software is available for download online. Its truly plug and play. I'm an illustrator, and I don't have as many problems as photographers do when it comes to color accuracy, so this equipment was just right.<br /><br />Just a warning to windows users, in order to make your profile be the default profile for your monitor you have to take some extra steps with the OS and that's not colormunki's fault, it's windows.Took about a 1/2 hour to figure out where to tell my computer to use the settings it made.
0399159347|5.0|The lives of three women who casually know one another are about to collide in ways none of them could have ever expected.<br /><br />Cecilia Fitzpatrick is happily married with three beautiful daughters, runs a successful Tupperware business and leads the parent organization at the local elementary school. Cecilia seems to be one of those `perfect' women who appear to flawlessly juggle it all with poise, grace and a smile.<br /><br />Tess Curtis has returned to her mother's home in Sydney, after receiving devastating news from her husband. Tess is not sure what comes next, but she was not prepared to run into her old flame, Connor Whitby. When things begin to heat back up between the two of them, she learns of his secret past.<br /><br />Rachel Crowley is consumed by grief over the loss of her daughter twenty years ago. She has found her only real joy is being a grandmother, but when her son and daughter-in-law surprise her with news -it's just too much. Rachel is again filled with bitterness and heartbreak. Hasn't life already cheated Rachel enough?<br /><br />The novel begins with Cecelia holding an envelope with the words, \\"For my wife, Cecilia Fitzpatrick. To be opened in the event of my death.\\" The thing is her husband, John-Paul, is still very much alive. When she asks him about it, he tells her he wrote the letter after the birth of their first daughter. He explained the letter is full of silly sentimental stuff. Believing him, she puts the letter away.<br /><br />When Cecilia's husband suddenly returns home early from his business trip and begins frantically searching for the letter, she realizes there is much more to the letter than what he led her to believe. She knows she needs to find out what he is keeping from her. With a quick slice from a letter opener a Pandora's Box explodes!<br /><br />A secret is revealed so shocking it causes the lives of the women to spiral out of control. As Cecelia digests what she learns, her perfect world begins to crumble all around her.<br /><br />There are secrets: big secrets, little secrets and there are choices. This is a novel about secrets and what we chose to do with them. Truly the most heart-wrenching stories I've read. I was able to connect with Cecilia, Rachel and Tess, the characters were so vulnerable and their feelings so raw. At times I had to remind myself I was reading a novel. I was not sure what I would do in any of their circumstances, and that bothered me. Usually I come away with a pretty strong opinion of how characters should have responded, but this novel digs a little deeper goes a little darker.<br />As the story unfolded, I found myself grappling with questions like: What I would do? Is it better to know the truth? Should you always tell the truth? Can you live with a lie?<br /><br />The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty tells an amazing story of three women as they deal with unforeseen truths. The novel is written with alternating perspectives of all three women. Be ready to sit down with a phenomenal book that is fast paced and emotionally driven--you will not want to put it down! Be warned, just when you think it's all over the epilogue begins and it is so powerful it blew me away! I am highly recommending.all around her.<br /><br />There are secrets: big secrets, little secrets and there are choices. This is a novel about secrets and what we chose to do with them.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|A good way to kill time. Not a fan of how quickly I run out of energy though. No real complaints
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This is a great movie, exploring the lives and music of three very different guitarists. I feel like I got to know these men and to better appreciate what they were trying to convey through their music.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Just wish I knew what I was doing all the time lol My only negative response is the cost to clear trees. Some of the same types cost such a huge difference in price... $10,000 for one but $150,000 for the same kind in another area....crazy! But it is fun:)
0802473156|5.0|Everyone should read this book at least once in their life. I think it should be required reading in high school. It can be life-changing!!
B000002H38|5.0|Her voice is like silk and satin... Smooth .. My favorite , YOU BRING ME JOY!!! I would definitely recommend.
0399255370|5.0|My five year old LOVES this book, we've read it hundreds of times and he still wants to reread it, he's memorized several of the letters.
B00008CMR6|5.0|I love John Wayne & I have seen everything that has been released of his movies.  I can't tell you how much I enjoy this film and all of his movies.  I have several of his films in my library of films.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|It's not as good as seeing in on Broadway was, but it's a good substitute that's available whenever I want it.
0788859544|5.0|I love this movie - it is one of my favorite Disney animated movies.  This is my niece's favorite movie character - She still loves Ariel.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|The movie was simply mind blowing ! Super fast screenplay, unbelievable yet completely plausible (when you think about it later) sequences and great twists. 2 hours flew just like that. Keeps the audience engaged right from start to end. Definitely worth a watch and a re-watch too !
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I really like this game.  It's engaging and keeps my attention.  I would recommend this game to anyone.  It really makes you think outside the box to come up with the solutions sometimes which makes it a addictive.
B007FLHW3K|4.0|After reading the other reviews I bought two of these, because I suspected that I wouldn't be riding fast enough to display the effects on the whole wheel. That turned out to be true.<br /><br />Everyone loves these, but I have some suggestions for MonkyLectric:<br />  1. It would be nice to have one module able to sync and control both units.  As it is it is too difficult to get both modules to display the same pattern.<br />  2.  You need two modules to cover a wheel, so eliminate the control unit in one, provide a master & slave module in the kit.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The only thing I was surprised about was that it did not include the actual plug.  Apparently I didn't read the description carefully enough.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I don't even know what to say about the book....besides the fact that I loved every moment about it. It reminded me of the first love that existed and you how you never wanted to let it go. I can say that I am so disappointed at the ending, only because I HAVE to allow my mind to run wild and consider the after effects... Every word that I have in the book gave me butterflies. It gave me the feeling to be excited, anxious, upset, and it allowed me to cry. I think it's because I do cry easily. I recommend the book if you are looking for an innocent love story (((((:
B006HL9G10|2.0|Maybe I just don't understand the concept well enough, but I'm not sure exactly what it is supposed to do.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|At first the book was a slow starting but then you learn that Mr. Grey has a side to him that is kind of sexy but then it is too much. I mean, seriously? If I was Ana, I would be running for the hills. I get it a bit of kinky sex can go a long way but would I wanted to be &#34;spanked&#34; so badly that my tooshie would hurt even to sit down. Sexy man or not, this really didn't excite me. It took me a whole nine months to read and just let me say that even when I got to the ending, book number two was not the next book to buy on my list. If you like BDSM, fine have fun but if you are looking for more of the soft BDSM with romance as a kick start this might not be the book for you.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|\\"Heaven is here, I'm a part of it, it's mine.\\"  Lovely story!  Brought tears to my eyes. I'm so<br />glad Jamie found peace.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I really enjoyed reading a book about such a terrible disease, that could even so light up some pretty impressive feelings like love and kindness. I'll definitely remember Augustus and Hazel for a long time.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|It was a great buy, everything worked and its an awesome movie!!! Thanks again! Wohoo I don't know what else you want me to say
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|very fun and addictive. cant stop playing like being able to build your own park and design it how you want.
B008MM9630|5.0|love it my only problem is when will you get rid of facebook like a lot of games have it this game I give it 10 stars
B00479SVBU|4.0|It's almost rare these days to find any consumer electronics device that isn't overloaded with gimmicky &#34;bells and whistles&#34; or designed with obsolescence in mind. The Satechi Soundfly stands against this trend, definitively simple in its design and powerful in its utility. And so long as digital music holds sway, highly utilitarian.<br />I pair it with a SanDisk Cruzer 16GB flash drive (about the size of my pinkie nail), with allows for a fair catalog of music without increasing the size or profile of the device. Already lightweight and unobtrusive, the Soundfly also seems fairly durable (though only time will be the true judge of that).<br />In addition to being a playback device, it's also a really solid transmitter, far better than the two standalone devices my girlfriend purchased for her car. If there's any (minor) complaint so far, it's that you need to always remember to shut it down or remove it after you cut your car off; it keeps running and drains battery otherwise. Also, sometimes you need to &#34;reset&#34; it by disconnecting it from the lighter jack after powering it down. Otherwise it will appear to be on and playing when you turn it on next but will not transmit any sound.
B00138H1MS|5.0|for any Elvis fan--like this as it doesn't seemed to have been remastered so you get the original flavor of the song as it was done back in the 50s not a cleaned up version...
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. I enjoy it every time I watch it. A really great movie.
1439181780|5.0|This book is very easy to follow and full of some pretty profound ideas. It really gives you something to meditate about.
B00004X10B|3.0|This bag is large and bulky.  It needs wheels, as in luggage, to pull.  Is rather uncomfortable to care. It is heavy.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|Not a hardcore fan. Not even a little. But the creativity on this album is just incredible. They go above and beyond what one would expect from a band that has it's roots in hardcore. Excellent musical talent from these guys. Highly recommend.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book had me laughing & crying, I couldn't put it down! I'm so intrigued & can't wait for the next one!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This movie was recommended by family members. Acting is terrific, Story line is different. I love this movie and will watch it again and again. Get it!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Nothing to complain about here.  Finally got a wonderful birthday present...seasons 1,2 &3 of The Walking Dead.  I've been obsessed with zombies for years, and when this show came out, I was immediately hooked.  Best of the best as far as zombie cinema is concerned....  You will not be disappointed.  :P
B0068FYZ84|5.0|Thanks to this movie, my son is learning the different sounds animals around the farm make. Paired with a fun song that we sing and dance to during the movie and the end, it's a great movie for little ones.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is amazing I love it so much this is my new number one app to play because that's how much I love this game this game is extremely amazing!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is highly addictive but worth it! The best part is that you do not have to spend one dime to complete it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I couldn't wait to see the next episode and I didn't have to since I bought both seasons.  This is great!
B0080QOLCE|4.0|Half of the fun and enjoyment I got out of this movie was watching so many cast members that I remember from other places in a totally new situation.  It won't win any awards, but it's worth the price of admission and a fun way to spend an hour and a half.  Recommended.
B00DM11LV6|5.0|This movie is so beautifully told and I love it. I think both actresses did a fantastic job, but Traci Dinwiddie is my favorite. I wish I had a &#34;Peyton&#34; in my life. I especially love that they had some true stories in the movie. Soulemetry?? Wonder if they just made that up for the movie or it's for real. Might have to check Amazon for books. I think that out of all of the lesbian movies that I have seen (which to be honest, hasn't been many), this is the best one. Definitely you should see it.
B005JS7VTQ|5.0|I have to say, I took a chance on this and am very happy. First of all, even with owning the box set which came out years ago, I had most of the choice cuts. But as I never bought all of these albums back in the day, after 45 years there were still songs I was unfamiliar with. Some are not great but only a few. Nearly everything here is first rate. Boy do I miss the time when people went into a studio with song ideas and crafted a delightful and complex musical journey from one side to the other. The Captain and Me, What Were Once Vices and Taking It To The Streets are three of the best rock and roll albums of the '70s. The other two included here have many great songs as well. Seriously, the Doobies and Ted Templeman never got enough credit for how good these albums really were. Besides discovering a few great songs I missed back then, I was looking for clean and dynamic mastering and I am very happy with the way these sound. For the price it is beyond a no brainer.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I think its all been said in 5000+ reviews.  I loved this book.<br /><br />So much of what is written in the Science Fiction world is \\"copy cat\\".  The Ender series is all original.<br /><br />Very fun read indeed.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Amazon has done an excellent job in explaining all the aspects of Kindle. A must read for anyone interested in publishing on Kindle.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|The book is a few years old, and well known.  It reads well and does an excellent job comparing histories, societies, technological development, and  explaining &#34;what happened&#34; in historical development.  Well worth the read and very insightful on the future.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|It was an informative, entertaining and even moving story. If you are a fan of the series, I recommend reading it. You'll have a fuller picture of what the real Piper is like.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|this is a wonderful video it has been watched several times and is continually on the want to watch list
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Really keeps your attention, keeps you guessing.  Great actors, really enjoying the characters. Would be great to have a season 2
B0013FSL3E|5.0|this is a wonderful video it has been watched several times and is continually on the want to watch list
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|i have tried on hulu and netflix to be able to watch my favorite shows and now i can. thank you so much for making this possible.  the are great shows.
B00ADS90EQ|4.0|This is your ultimate chick flick, but the songs were new and the harmonies were really good. It didn't pack as much of a cinematic punch at the end as I thought it would, though. However, it was cute, and I liked it. But I'm kind of upset I didn't rent it first!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|One of the best and most concise books on energy management I have read.  Some of the books get too wordy or lost in semantics but this one nails it simply.  A keeper and a good reference for a quick refresher.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|the animation is really good and so is the life lesson such a cute movie for my daughter even the little boy neighbors were cracking up!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The acting was great. Parts of the movie were just stupid. The special effects were neat. The last ten to fifteen minutes were the best part.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|This narrative is excruciatingly boring, interspersed with attempts at descriptions of hot sex. Pathology mixed with mundane and very ordinary interactions among  rather shallow characters!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved it! The story was good, it did not drag at all...I would recommend this in a heartbeat for sure.
014242921X|5.0|Read this book in school many years ago and loved it.  Still do. Listened to it twice already. Buy it.
B00B4FU6KE|2.0|I didn't care too much for the characters, so emotionally this book didn't do much for me. The only parts that tugged at me were the those describing poor conditions animals were living in, and even then I didn't feel it was so much part of the story as a political stand. It was also just sort of boring. Overall, I would not recommend.
0792844890|4.0|There are some fans of science fiction, especially of revered franchises such as Star Wars and Star Trek, who are such die-hard fans that they hold their universe of choice as sacred.  There are fans who hold such franchises in such high regard that the thought of any parodying of their chosen obsession is not only wrong, but blasphemous.  Never mind that, as classic as they are, such sci-fi mainstays are chock-full of weird and goofy moments themselves -- these fans will not see their beloved films or TV series skewered, and woe betide the filmmaker who chooses to lampoon their beloved franchise.<br /><br />Good thing I'm not one of those fans.  Because as much as I love Star Wars, I also love \\"Spaceballs\\" for giving the films a playful kick in the pants.  This film is a hilarious skewering of Star Wars in particular, but also of science fiction films in general, and no franchise -- from Transformers to \\"Alien\\" to \\"Planet of the Apes\\" -- is safe.<br /><br />On the faraway planet of Druidia, Princess Vespa is about to get married... but she's bored by her prince and runs away with her faithful robotic maid, Dot Matrix.  A tyrannical warlord named Dark Helmet (a short, nerdy Darth-Vader-wannabe played hilariously by Rick Moranis) and the hilariously inept President Skroob (Mel Brooks himself) seek to kidnap the princess with the aid of their loyal but idiotic crew, only for rogue smuggler Lone Starr (Bill Pullman) and his furry co-pilot Barf (the late John Candy) to intercept and rescue her.  What follows is a madcap race across the galaxy with Dark Helmet and Skroob on hot pursuit, a possible romance interrupted by Dot Matrix at every turn, and Lone Starr's eventual training in the art of \\"the Schwartz\\" by the mystical, merchandise-hawking Yogurt (Brooks again).  The plot is merely a framework to hang joke after joke on, however, and by the end of the movie everything sacred to Star Wars, from the epic soundtrack to the classic characters to the Force itself, will have been mercilessly lampooned, countless other sci-fi franchises will have been skewered, and the fourth wall will have been utterly destroyed.<br /><br />Part of what makes this film work is the cast.  Yes, it's full of well-known actors, but each one pulls their part off remarkably well.  Bill Pullman knows he's essentially playing a knockoff of Harrison Ford's Han Solo (with a dash of Skywalker thrown in), and rather than try to top Ford at his own game he simply adapts a wise-cracking, laid-back attitude that suits his character well.  John Candy, as Barf, serves as a wry commentator and a provider of many of the meta jokes of the film.  Rick Moranis provides one of the most hilarious parodies of Darth Vader ever -- a blustery, nerdy, but earnest tyrant whose ego makes up for his lack of height -- and Joan Rivers steals every scene she's in as Dot Matrix.<br /><br />There's not much of a plot to speak of in this film, and it serves mostly as an excuse to pile on joke after joke.  And some of the jokes do miss -- the \\"combing the desert\\" pun was fairly groan-worthy, and some of the names (Snotty, Barf, Yogurt, Col. Sanderz) are more stupid than amusing.  But more often than not the jokes work, and hilariously so.  The best jokes, in my opinion, are those that pierce the barrier between film and audience -- the characters watching the movie itself to find out what happens in another scene, asides to the audience, a camera man getting killed in the middle of a battle scene, and a hilarious mix-up involving the main cast's stunt doubles.  Yogurt's constant hawking of Spaceballs products is a barbed but funny jab at the Star Wars franchise, and Dark Helmet's interlude in his quarters playing with his action figures is probably one of the best scenes of the movie.<br /><br />The DVD release itself is fairly bare-boned, with a \\"making-of\\" feature and an interview with Brooks himself.  The Blu-Ray and special edition are said to have more content, however... and I'm sort of hoping that one of these days Brooks releases a new version of the film with some pointless CGI thrown in, just for an extra poke at Lucas' franchise.  Because even as a Star Wars fan I'm not above laughing at the films I love.<br /><br />Those watching this movie expecting a coherent plot will probably be disappointed.  But for those who just want to laugh for an hour and a half, and enjoy a good send-up of a classic franchise, this is for you.rt of hoping that one of these days Brooks releases a new version of the film with some pointless CGI thrown in, just for an extra poke at Lucas' franchise.

B002T9H2LA|5.0|One of the many of my tarintino favorites, this movie is breathtakingly Clever, funny with in your face violence. I love everything about it. Great cast, impeccable acting and overall good storytelling. Read the info if you want to know details on what it's about (or just watch the movie like a normal person) I highly recommend !!!
B0000DYKET|2.0|I really wanted to like these sandals and had been looking forward to getting a pair. First impressions were good even though they are quite heavy for a sandal. After a while I noticed how clammy and wet the foot bed got in a very short period of time. (I don't as a rule have sweaty feet.) They were fine around town and casual wear. Finally after owning them about a year I used them on a hike.<br />BIG mistake! They are without doubt the worst possible sandal for hiking on anything but a smooth surface without any debris such as small rocks and sticks, etc. Their design is perfect for allowing anything and everything to enter into the foot bed and stay there. Between the straps and recessed foot bed every little pebble and twig that EASILY came in could not get out. Last week end I hiked up a river bed to a hot springs and I found myself taking them off every 1000 feet or so to clean them. I eventually had to pull a pair of socks over them in order to keep up with my friends. That lasted about one mile at best before socks disintegrated, and then I was again stopping to clear them. NOTHING short of removing them worked to clear out all the crap they literally invited into them. It was horrible! And they have ZERO traction on the kinds of surfaces found in river beds. Slimy rocks and even dry rocks once they are wet. Much of the trip I found my self composing a nasty review, until it occurred to me that maybe this is not their intended purpose. It wasn't until I got back and looked up descriptions about them and realized they are advertised as a sandal suitable for hiking and outdoor adventure. This is to me a BOLD FACED LIE. They are USELESS for such things.<br />That said, they look okay, are comfortable for the most part, and seem to be well made. The name says it all; NEWPORT. Perfect for bicycling, walks on the dock, boating maybe. They are slippery when wet. A casual sandal for casual uses. Nothing more. Fortunately I bought them at REI, so I'm cleaning them upand returning them.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|I pre ordered this movie thinking I would get to enjoy it the day it was released. Wow was that mistake. I could have purchased the collectors edition from target for 2 dollars more and had it now. I will never pre order, or just order, anything from amazon again.updAte finally received the movie, Abrams should never be allowed to work in film again. This movie was just plain awful, I wish I could get my money back.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It is really hard to find a tv series that isn't all about human violence against each other or reality shows.  This is neither and greatly entertaining.

B000SUKPKM|3.0|Wish I would have read reviews before ordering. This is a near perfect greatest hits album by band except the \\"new version\\" of \\"Name\\". Terrible! Why would you exclude the original version of your 1st and possibly biggest hit of your career? I am sure I will burn a copy of this CD on a recordable disk and exclude the new version and add the original version from a Boy Named Goo so it can be perfect. I am sure there are some BS legal reasons behind it with the labels. Who knows!
B0058VW36U|3.0|Game ok.  but annoying that filled with offers to upgrade.  I like a game to be complete when purchased no additions to be purchased later.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Not what I was expecting or looking for in a mahjong game.  The markings on the tiles are often difficult to differentiate
1878424319|5.0|Awesome book, one of the best I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books. A short easy read packed full of great information that can actually change your life!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Sit down and relax, don't try to figure the plot out, there is none.<br />Enjoy it with popcorn, all it is action, action and action.<br />Don't think.<br />.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Pretty good solve-a-problem type show.. Not super deep but fun. I enjoy the practical aspects of how they approach the problems.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just like book one, I could not put this book down.  The captivating characters in a story of love, family and war make the story jump off the pages!
B003F48E4W|5.0|If you have not seen this film then you have missed one of the best horror movies ever made. word.
0345548981|5.0|Novak is not only a top tennis player but he writes very well. The book covers many topics from his childhood in Serbia to how his gluten intolerance was discovered. He gives many interesting pieces of information as well his diet plan and recipes. He also covers some basic yoga poses and streching. Higly recommend
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|I was a bit disappointed with this film. It just felt like a bad music video slash musical. I think it was going for the Moulin Rouge affect but it just fell flat. The first 30 min were a total bore and I almost gave up but decided to wait until Gatsby actually entered. I am glad I waited because it did get better once all the chop shots ended the plot actually began but I am still glad I did not waste money on this at the movie theater. I say worth a 1.99 rental but not much more. It did make want to re-read the book to reflect on the great plot that this movie glossed over. I felt like it took the key quotes from the book and that is about it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I have been waiting for a good series with both an interesting mystery to solve each week and a good story line on the characters- this is it!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|This movie could have been Amazing but it does fall a bit short. I still thought it was good but it does drag and some key things are not explained very well. I would recommend it when the price drops a bit I say it is worth a 1.99 rental not  a 3.99 rental.
B00EU9BSNU|4.0|\\"Rush\\" continues Hans Zimmer's recent trend of percussion and electronics.  The music is full of thrills and has a certain intensity throughout, which can get tedious at times but feels very appropriate for a racing film.  While I see the score working extremely well within the film, it's not quite as interesting as an isolated listening experience.<br /><br />There are a number of really great tracks on the album.  \\"1976\\" [Track 1] and \\"Stopwatch\\" [Track 4] are two of my favorites.  Several songs are also included (like \\"Fame\\" by David Bowie), which is great because it gives the album some much needed diversity.<br /><br />One thing I enjoy about many of Zimmer's albums is that one track often flows into the next without pause.  Keep in mind that if you like to just buy 1-2 of your favorite tracks in MP3 format, they might start/end abruptly.  This is because most of the tracks for \\"Rush\\" start off exactly where the last track ended, with absolutely no silence in between.<br /><br />\\"Rush\\" is the third of Zimmer's major works of 2013 - he also scored \\"Man of Steel\\" and \\"The Longer Ranger\\".  He's had a great year overall; although of the three I consider \\"The Lone Ranger\\" to be his best work (and that score has the most replay value).  Still, if you like Zimmer's style and want some cool music to drive to, then the \\"Rush\\" soundtrack gets my recommendation.<br /><br />FAVORITE TRACKS<br />[1] 1976<br />[4] Stopwatch<br />[15] Car Trouble<br />[20] For Love<br />[24] My Best Enemy
B009PNQUXO|5.0|Since both my I-phone and Galxay removed the your-tube app during the updating of software. I am glad to have it on one device that will not remove it during an up load.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game but why the heck do my coins keep disappearing???? Please fix this now, it's super annoying!!!
B000002KXV|5.0|This is a great album by one of the Steely Dan members.  I was buying his new album, Sunken Condos, and say this one, The Nightfly, and purchased it too.  I had the album on vinyl originally and this was a nice homecoming for some much loved music.  Well done album.
B00BSBUZPK|2.0|Being a Meisner fan  I was appalled at how the powers that be dissed Randy Meisner. I have never believed anything Henley & Frey have to say. What arrogant, misleading hog flies these two are. They were simply self promoting themselves and trying to rewrite history. Read the 2005 UPDATED 'First Da Capo Press' edition, of 'To The Limit' by Mark Eliot.. He added a lenghly postscript that solidified what I always knew. Randy Rocks!
B0097UGXFK|5.0|If you haven't seen this, I had not, it's worth a buy.  A good movie that moves along with a good plot.  Similar to the &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34; where even good kids can go bad in a big group.  A futuristic view and a good adventure.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Very entertaining, not too easy or too hard, never boring. My train travel time flies when I'm playing. I'm very happy with it.
0345536886|5.0|it turned into one of the best reads in many months.  Attorneys.  One that is a big corporate attorney on a non-stop schedule doing the same things every day.  Two that have been partners and are the quintessential &#34;ambulance chasers&#34;.  Literally.  When the corporate attorney finally has enough he ends up in a bar and in the offices of these two attorneys.  A sort of bond is made and they reluctantly hire him.  They take on a corporate case for a mass civil lawsuit.  That doesn't end exactly well but another case that the corporate attorney worked on his own pans out well.  One of the things that I learned is how some medicines are tested in the field.  That had a big impact on me.  Well worth the read!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Cool and creepy....I love the story behind it....I wish the whole  game was free I would play it all day
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This was a lovely story of a family torn and united in war and its aftermath, very tenderly told.  Of the lengths we will go to when required for survival.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It kept my interest from beginning to end.  Lives are intertwined in so many different ways and this was very well done.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|J. Cole really came into his own with this album.  Not only was this yet another project where he PRODUCED the hell out of it from top to bottom, but the result was history in doing so.  Though the album debuted a # 2 on the charts, it still managed to go #1 within a 1 MONTH time period.  If your a true (not just J. Cole fan) hip-hop fan this album is a MUST HAVE (press play & enjoy from start to finish album).  The year isn't over, but Born Sinner gets the Best Hip-Hop album of 2013 in my book.<br />My personal favorite picks (even though I loved the whole album)  are Crooked Smile, Power Trip, Chaining Day, Villuminati & Sparks Will Fly!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|This is an EP release by a great up and coming artist, it is definitely worth the download on amazon.

B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a must watch show! Every episode gets better and better. I love the high def streaming. Amazon Prime is easy and convenient.
B00CO4KGYA|2.0|For a bit this game was fun, until it started crahing. Now i cant even get through a single level without it crashing and closing, and I'm only in thefirst area. It is simply unplayable.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is my favorite. No lie, good pricing and good quality. New and everything. Thank you so much. Sorry for late rate.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I like the game. It's cute. I have only one complaint thus far, and that is I'm already out of hints and that screen is locked up on &quot;buy the pro level.&quot; I would like to have more hints as some levels are really challenging. I have to reset some levels several times.
B00BP0OFWI|5.0|Great reading. A lot of history. The story had me more scared then the child soldier. Read the book in two days.
B008TTPQXA|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book and it made me think a lot.  I was expecting more of the book to be focused on trying to articulate experiences on the other side as opposed to describing what was happening on earth.  I thought that the 'other side' part of the book was too brief, given the title of the book.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Was a bit confusing how the individual 3 packs could be cheaper than the 6 pack, but I look forward to enjoying all 6 movies when I get back to the US.
B001D09OAI|5.0|Major League is a hilarious movie filled with jokes that are still funny, and you are doing yourself a disservice not having seen it.

0345803485|1.0|I want to start out by saying that I have not read this book, but only skimmed through it.  Knowing the nature of its content, I have avoided it, based on my own personal morals and beliefs about how sex should be.  But, given its popularity, I thought that it was a least written well.  I was wrong.<br /><br />I skimmed through it in the bookstore and almost laughed out loud.  How did this book get published?  And then, what disturbs me more, is the fact that perhaps it was written this way on purpose??  Did the writer intentionally make this girl sound younger than she really is?  If that's the case, then we have to ask ourselves what we are really reading here.  This girl sounds young -- very young -- and I don't care how old the author says she is, this book describes a young girl being used (and I'm being forgiving in my description here) by a much older man.<br /><br />Which makes this book even more disturbing than I thought before.  As a woman and a mother of a daughter, I ask you how something like this could even become popular?  It makes me afraid.  Very afraid.
B009IF82SK|5.0|Being overseas, I miss a lot of the TV seasons. Got to see the whole season, even being away. I am ready for the next season.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game has nice graphic's and is a good game to pass the time, and you don't have to think to much
B000PDYVVG|1.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is a talented writer and once I picked up this book I couldn't put it down - that is until she started talking about veal. Veal? On a spiritual journey? It completely ruined it for me. I was so disappointed because I wanted to keep reading but I just couldn't. Luckily in the movie she stuck to spaghetti. What a relief. I'd love to give this book 5 stars because no doubt Elizabeth Gilbert is a terrific writer with a good story to tell here, but because of the veal, I couldn't get past EAT, so I have to give it 1 star. I had a much better experience with the sequel, Committed, which was terrific.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|Excellent movie and product.  Looks even better on Blu-Ray.  I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.  Thank you for the shipment...everything came in good condition.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This App is the best app that you can download. It's very informative. It has everything that you will ever need.Try it for yourself!!!
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Received the package in excellent condition and in a timely manner.  Movies are awesome and the quality of the product is excellent.  I highly recommend it to those who have not seen it.
B00139XSBA|5.0|Tom Wolf perception and writing style cast a scathing eye on the testosterone drive, shenanigans, and mores of the period.  I was one of the adoring public that admired and tracked &#34;the astronauts&#34; but never understood the tragic forces that drove so many young, talented men to almost frivolous deaths and fronted a public facade of &#34;perfect families.&#34;  Riveting
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game for down time. Try to save your prizes to get more coins. The puzzle pieces are an added challenge. Enjoy.......
B002ZM74Y6|4.0|Could have been a little shorter in time.  At times the dragged out some scenes.  But we would watch it again
B0061P2L5U|5.0|I have a daughter with severe food and environmental allergies. It has a major negative impact on her life as you can imagine. Despite eating a very clean, healthy diet and doing the \\"right\\" things for health, her allergies only increased and worsened. Then I found this book and in some ways, it was an AHA! moment. My child, especially while she was in the womb, was probably not exposed to enough \\"old friends\\" bacteria. I lived a very sterile lifestyle and was an obsessive handwasher. This book presents several studies to explain how exposure to certain types of bacteria trains the immune system and prevents allergies and autoimmune diseases, especially while in the womb and in the first year of life. Also, this book does a key thing for me. It explains why inner city children have allergies, especially asthma, but they often live in a dirty environment compared to the children from the suburbs. That point alone is why I never accepted the hygiene hypothesis until now. It seems the more I learn, the more I realize man can not stray far from nature without paying for it!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Totally addicted to this game. Once I've beaten it, I restart and challenge myself to up my high scores. A must have on every Android device.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Very informative, and the information makes complete sense..This book will make you look at your life and the things you do on a more conscious level. An absolute must read if you want a better life.
B00275EHJG|4.0|It is what I expected.  I already had a copy; however, a child destroyed the one I had and so I had to replace it.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Great book with a personal insight into one athlete's life and experiences that help him to grow as a person as well as a runner.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this daily. It is awesome to have the word with you @ all times. I also have you version on my cell.
1594133379|5.0|This is an amazing story.  I have parkinson's and have had deep brain surgery.  This left me with some brain damage to &#34;overcome&#34;.  This book shows that it can be done.  The author is living poof of neuroplasticity.  A great read.
B001AUAK3G|5.0|This is fantastic collection at an amazing price.  You get to hear some of the greatest Wagnerian singers, often in their prime, and some historic performances.  All of the canon is here, and the price cannot be beaten.  I'm currently listening to them in order of composition, and I'm delighted with both Dutchman and Tannhauser (and the latter is, perhaps, my least favorite Wagner opera).  I'm currently listening to Lohengrin, and am looking forward to the remaining operas.  You may feel that there are other, better recordings of any one of these operas, but this is terrific addition to your Wagner or general opera collection.
1594200106|5.0|This is a magnificent story written by a master. It has a European flair and it keeps you in suspense throughout. Great character development. Not boring, fast reading and extremely well written.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|Watching season one opened up a lot of possibilities. The one controlling my body, me, is capable of a lot more than I am aware of. Fringe is good at letting me see or become aware of my and others possibilities.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|Not their best. There are a few songs that capture the energy of the prior releases. I realize they were going for &#34;old school metal&#34; on this release, but it falls short of my expectations for this group. Not being a hater and I'm not saying it's bad......I'm just sayin'
B005DOKL3E|5.0|It was what I was looking for. Simple, not expensive, and I like the color. I would buy another one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just love the simplicity and easy of use.. was able to set it up in about 60 seconds.. the quality is stunning @ full 1080p..
B0019IIPZO|4.0|Riddick is a fascinating character amid a fascinating, but deadly world. His unique night-vision lets us see what's hiding in the blackness, as we follow a group of stranded travelers looking for a way off a dangerous planet.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Avid fan of the entire Star Trek movie series. Supposed to get it in two days because I preordered it a month or so ago. SAw the movie twice in the theater. Great job in all acting and consistency.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game.my kids love it.I find myself playing from time to time.even my 2 year tries to mash buttoms. Lol
B0051BVQFG|5.0|Being a former Marine, I can identify with some situations shown in the movie. Pretty realistic as far as the discipline, and actions are concerned. Of course the aliens could have been a bit uglier. Have seen this flick several times.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I would highly recommended this application it does everything I need from it..... I use it all the time &amp; like that they have alerts for bad weather approaching.

B000TJQ75O|5.0|I don´t have CDs from Natalie Imbruglia and in this CD I could find a good list of hits. Very recomended.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved 50 shades and after looking for one that could give it a run for its money, I came across Bared to you... I fell in love with the Charactors and freaking am hooked! Great story line, great detail in characters personalities you are up and down... Gideon Cross has become my new flavor!!! Move over Christian Grey!! Gideon is a beast with the right way of looking at love!!! Sylvia Day rocked it!!!

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I have to credit Fox News and its infamous interview with the author for inspiring me to read this well written and informative book about the historical Jesus and the early Christian church.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Just a great movie about what our society is capable of, and where we could go as a people. At least they showed the good also...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just installed device using MacBook in 1 minute.  The chromecast is great for casting chrome browser onto TV.  I have many clients that want this feature ...in past had to run hdmi, VGA through walls to TV if they didn't have Apple TV and Mac (AirPlay).<br /><br />My 3 year old daughter began casting Netflix from her gen 1 iPad during my tests!<br /><br />I just ordered 3 more.  Main use for me is to project chrome browser screen from MacBook or laptop to large tv.  My kids may use the Netflix streaming though.<br /><br />Great for windows users who want the MacBook/apple TV mirroring for only $35!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Could use some improvement on screen design for viewing, but nice game. Will keep you occupied when bored and looking for a time filer.
B001GCUO16|3.0|Huuummm the movie is entertaining but the story is sooo NOT the original &#34;origins&#34; story. Anyways, Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine and Taylor Kitsch IS Gambit. Good job
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addicting, you find yourself so involved the time just flies by...love it! Hours can just disappear from your day.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|Far from the original first class. That said.. the movie, story, characters and special effects are pretty good. Very entertaining
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Amazing series of books!  Incredible story line, so many surprises and twists and turns.  Sorry to see it end...for now!  Can't wait for #6!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|interesting characters<br />mysterious but not annoying<br />great acting<br />beautifully shot<br />compelling dynamic between the 2 partners<br />cheesy to say, but the setting is gorgeous
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Keep wondering who's going to find out when.  Surely at some point the secret will be all out.  Can Mike do anything to correct his past omission?  So the romance begins.  Rachel indeed is not the Good Girl.
B00B52F278|4.0|I rated it as a four because it was depressing in the end even though you knew what was going to happen.  The one time in early history that the good guys could have been the winners but instead were destroyed!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I started watching the show some where in season 2, so some things didn't make lots of sense.  This is a great show and better because I got all the details from the beginning.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is one of those games that you can leave and<br /><br />Come back to over a week and not really have lost<br /><br />Any thing
B000FC0ZEO|4.0|Perhaps I was caught up in the series but this last Fool book was flat. I hated the missed connections at the end. I missed the wolf / man connections.  Felt the story could have been better done if the main character had followed up on his education about animal connections.  Or they could have developed the after life connection of the wolf more.  there was probably a comment/ reason for ignoring that part of the story. But it made the whole story flat to me.  Oh he gets the girl/middle aged lady by then at the end. But his relationship with his daughter is minor, his relationship with her children even less. It was a ok ending. but flat. I wanted more for both the Fool and the man.  At least a good Good by.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Watched THE HELP was entertaining and thoughtful..Have passed movie on to others to watch.. Gret movie.. thanks will look for more such movies.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Even though this book's characters are mostly young adults it is appropriate for all ages. It just wants the reader to finish it as soon as possible so you can go on to the sequals. A very exciting book.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|I watch this on my Kindle Fire. it showed up excellent I would love this movie even if it was on VHS. the clarity was amazing.
B000MGVCFO|5.0|I keep waiting for audio-only blu ray discs with lossless resolution to make an appearance in the marketplace.  Fortunately, while we wait, there are still SACD discs available that can provide higher-than-CD quality sound, in many cases, such as this, with a choice between stereo and surround sound.  EGBDF hopefully needs no introduction as a classic album, and the surround mix on this title does not disappoint.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Just find this movie great!  the humor is dark and very well executed and had me laughing so much.  All the actors were great at playing their respective roles.  Awesome movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I use it on my Kindle Fire and it was easy to install and works great, Minecraft is the best game ever
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Good book kept my interest and couldn't put it down at times. It did have some predictability that kept me saying to myself I can't believe Clary hasn't figured it out yet!
B00005JA8B|5.0|terminator or predator his best in both good adversaries  arent too many movies u can do sequels to these are the best
B0015FN05Q|5.0|I first read this book fifty years ago. I just read it again after experiencing life. I should have listened more carefully. OM
B009R659L8|5.0|Great book.  Just what I expect from Mary Higgins Clark.  Gets your attention in the first chapter and keeps you guessing
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I'm addicted, it's very entertaining!!! The game is very simple and fun. Strongly recommended to anyone who is bored and need to kill time
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Hail to the King continues the pattern Avenged has established of powerful music and lyrics but moves away (I think) from the hardcore roots and into more melodic and intricate music. I think it shows a progression of their musical development. I, personally, enjoy it and when combined with the last three albums on random, it sounds like one giant body of work exploring different musical areas and lyrical themes.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|A movie that can be watched over and over because there is so much information in it.  Great acting by all.
B00439MV42|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE COLLECTION I HAVE! I enjoyed watching them in the theatres and now I enjoy them at home.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Enjoyed beginning to end<br />Referred to friends as well<br />The epilogue was great to get answers behind the decisions the characters made
B007VDN1PA|2.0|Does not work as advertised,pictures quality very poor when viewed on computer screen images very blurry and not good enough
B009AY04A8|5.0|Simple hidden image game, free hints if you need so your never stuck. You can skip the dialogue, if you don't find it amusing.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I really liked this flick. It was entertaining and clean. I didn't read the book so I don't know how well it followed the story line.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Don't y'all think it's a little weird that the Kindle will give you game news but . not update news? Just wondering otherwise it is an amazing game. Get it especially if you have kids that are fans of the show.
0880796863|2.0|The colors aren't done well, too faded.  It's the same as the original Rider Waite with this exception.  Wish I hadn't bought this deck.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is a decent story<br />I would say yes it could have a have a better ending we want a nother story
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Once you set back your expectations to the late 60's, you realize just how many hot topics this TV series tacked.<br /><br />Of course, part of the fun is to watch my wife react to some of the sexist comments, for example, &#34;She's intelligent... for a woman&#34; or (from memory) &#34;[NOMAD] Her mind has no structure at all... [McCoy] It's a woman!&#34;.<br /><br />Any how, great fun!
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Always a pleasure to read it again and getting immerse in Stocker's universe. Beside it is also awesome to have this free kindle version of such a classical Gothic novel.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and wish more episodes were available. My only dislike was that Matthew died. Its like the children are jinxed in there love relationships. But all and all it's fabulous and the whole family can watch it.
B004HWT6DO|4.0|THE SOCIAL NETWORK is very well-filmed, and though the dialogue is sometimes a little TOO ultra-witty, its natural acting helps to bring about an immediate realism.  It focuses mainly on the legal complications and conundrums, i.e., lawsuits by Zuckerberg's fellow students at Harvard who played big roles in spawning and developing the whole idea of Facebook. I never would have dreamed it possible that someone could make a legal drama set mostly in depositions rather than trials work so well, but this film accomplishes just that--the fact that it's a true story certainly helps. It gives a well-rounded and convincing picture of the various entanglements Facebook went through in its early stages, also effectively showing how just about any large corporation-to-be experiences similar issues. While Zuckerberg is portrayed as less-than-likeable, his precocity is hard to ignore, and THE SOCIAL NETWORK gives a very non-editorialized portrayal of him and all the other players here. There's also a lot of Ivy League-level girl-chasing, partying, and so forth, which, again, is shown so realistically that it's quite engrossing.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|In true style, Ford delivers simple, moving plot and story. Part suspense, part growing up in failed family, part comparison between the US and Canada, Ford manages to engage me and want more.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Love these movies. This one gives so much background for the other three. I actually know now the meaning of so many story lines.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I just love his music and his singing.  Saw him on a TV special and  decided to get his latest music CD.
B00846REIS|4.0|Loved it. A little bit sweeter than the 50 Shades of Grey series. Has romance as well as total hotness.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|I saw his special on PBS and decided I had to have it for my library he was just awesome.  He is a great singer/entertainer and I would highly recommend his CD/DVD's
B007L5LD9O|4.0|Very detailed action made my friend and I laughing all the time. A great love story to watch for fun.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I learned a lot about Tesla and also quite a bit about what makes a genius a genius. Good book.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Looking forward to the continuing saga of Gideon and Eva's love story.  Wonder what will happen next.  Hope they make a HBOor Cinemax series out of these novels.
B008KE3960|5.0|One of the best free games out there! Don't wait, download it now while it's still free! You won't be disappointed!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|What can I say? It's Goodfellas, one of the best movies ever made. If you haven't seen it, do so now.
B003Z0BWR2|2.0|Nothing happened, the story went no where, its obviously just a filler. I found the same issues with book 3. I bought all five of the series thinking they would be similar to the first but nope - really bad, boring, lackluster.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love going back and seeing how people lived in the early days!  This is a great way to see that!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|A friend recommended I should start watching Suites. I'm so happy I did. I love this show. I highly recommend it!
B000SGSU58|5.0|Currently reading the Harry Bosch novels. Harry Bosch a very misunderstood and flawed LAPD detective. He's also one of the best at getting the bad guys. Concrete Blonde is a must read.
B00846REIS|5.0|Absolutely w/out a doubt breathtaking; could not put all 3 of the crossfire books down; but needed to get some sleep
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Well written, good continuity, good insight into the afghan life  . Easy and enjoyable reading.  Mr. Hosseini is a gifted writer.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|In a world where sampling and putting out discs for the sake of a sale is common. Its really difficult to come across new fresh material that does not sound too different that it ends up a eventually spending its final days on an alternative shelf in the music store. Many experimental artist often hit and miss. With Janelle the fusion of sound is very original yet has the balance and good sound of a traditional decent RNB music. Love IT. Have a place for it on my shelf between my Frank Ocean and Miguel discs.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|can't wait to watch the show! I've heard it's fantastic. Very interesting book, gives you a little more insight into the prison system... Very different read for me, but I still enjoyed it!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Great movie, awesome action scenes and nice pick of villain actor. Bought via streaming and movie downloaded and played to perfection.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Book was good I love this book it is my favorite I even have two rabbits hazel and blackberry they are almost like the characters in the book
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|Started with the free version and quickly realized I was going to need to upgrade. Highly addictive and fun. So far,  no system bugs to speak of.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My Kids Love This Game.  It Is User Friendly And A Appropriat For All ageS. Who Doesn't LiKe Despicable Me?
B00CY5Y3A2|5.0|I was very happy to see the acappella version of Heaven is a Place on Earth as the copy I had on the 12&#34; never sounded all that great and here it is crystal clear and her voice really shines. This was never one of my favorite Belinda recordings I think because it was so overplayed in the 80s. There are some great tracks here and it's nice to hear them again in remastered format. If only some other groups would jump on the band wagon and release Deluxe packages as nice as these. It's nice to see the old videos again although they don't seem to be cleaned up like the CDs are but then again I was watching on my PC.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Loved this and the 2nd and 3rd installments of the series. This book is a quick yet exciting read with interesting characters.
B009K916ZK|4.0|Simple and sweet. This product doesn't need a review. it is what it is, it works great, shipped fast. Serves its purpose great. (i use it for hooking up an additional monitor to my macbook pro). Its great. Only reason for 4 stars, price, i feel these could be cheaper. Just cause apple's name is on it, it's more expensive.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Creepy series, but well-written and compelling. I couldn't put any if the books down. I read them all in one day.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Liked this book better than the first bc there was more chacterization.  The plot lines are never what they seem and  the tug of war between jace and clary is quite funny, yet endearing and exasperating at the same time.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|About an hour longer than it needed to be.<br />The excitment of the era wear off about 1/2 way through when they really start to attempt to incorperate the literary work into this cartoon of a picture.
B0068THAGY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot , all the actors did a good job and the movie is interesting  it reminds me of sandlot with aliens
B0035JNTA6|5.0|Perfect when you are in the mood for zany comedy. I hate that you are forced to put a certain amount of words in this review
B00BTHWFEC|5.0|Great album. Got it on vinyl, so it goes right in the rack with the rest of the Sabbath albums. Fits right in with the rest of the old Sabbath albums musically, also. Saw the band live a week after purchase, just like the old days. Sabbath ROCKS, man!
0142410314|5.0|Had to read for summer reading list, nice story and the book had some pictures, he is going to the third grade!<br />Easy read for him!
B002UWH8P6|4.0|It is a bit stressful to watch b/c nearly every episode is built around surviving another issue be it raw drama, mechanical failure, solar flares (have to have at least one of these time altering events lol...), xenophobia, or some earth based alliance with alternate plans.<br /><br />That said, it is good enough to yield the Stargate fix that was sorely missed after Netflix dropped SG-1
B00DYCFLRI|5.0|This is coming from a band who was only known a little bit to me last year and the year before. This is seriously the most anticipated CD of 2013. Tonight Alives sophomore disc includes \\"The Ocean\\" and eleven big boxes of treasure. \\"The Ocean\\" is a song about singer Jenna McDougalls battle with eczema and how it affected her life both physically and emotionally. I actually read a blog about this. The rest of the album also features the band's darker side as well as \\"The Ocean\\" which is the first track on here. There are songs on here that could actually be radio hits. I personally give this album an A+ for being one of the only albums this year not to have a single con. I recommend this CD to anyone that is looking for a CD with hard rock beats, instruments, and melodies.<br /><br />The Ocean (5/5)<br />Don't Wish (5/5)<br />Lonely Girl (5/5)<br />Hell And Back (5/5)<br />The Other Side (5/5)<br />The Fire (5/5)<br />Complexes (5/5)<br />Come Home (5/5)<br />Bathwater (5/5)<br />No Different (5/5)<br />Say Please (5/5)<br />You Don't Owe Me Anything (5/5)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing! I love it and play it all the time. This is a definite buy. But don't get the lite version it sucks
B005HED08I|5.0|A bit dated looking, however the special effects have been given an update ala George Lucas, but the excellent stories are still there as well as the excellent chemistry between the main characters. Made in a area where computers were room sized and isolated, all phones had cords and did all electronics and the majority of women quitted working when they got married or gave birth to a child, it was visionary for its' time. So check it out - not perfect but vast majority of the episodes have good to excellent stories unlike most of the Science Fiction TV shows of that era.
0345803485|5.0|It was all it was cut out to be. I read it in 4 days. I cant wait to start the 2nd one
140846988X|5.0|A wonderful companion to the radio series. I wish it were more like that, but this is still a good purchase.
B00821OX98|4.0|Cool show. Can't stop coming back for next episode. Wish they would have shown the invasion, but perhaps not quite enough budget for that. Overall very good, lots of subplots going on within the main story.
034580709X|5.0|I became a Harry Hole fan with later books but was excited to go back to the beginning. It's a great start and the series just keeps getting better. I can't wait until the newest is released!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|i love youtube i love listening to music and music is on one of my favorites thing s to do on boredom day. i will continue to use it for other types of music.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Just finished in one sitting.  Enjoyed the interesting storyline (nice break from witches, zombies, werewolves, vampires, etc.) and well done graphics.  There are lots of mini-games and no long lists of HO's.  There are hidden objects but they are woven into the game itself.  Also the diary has a built in strategy guide (sort of) in the casual mode that is helpful when stuck.  The DIARY on the lower left is not available until you actually PURCHASE the game which is kinda pricy for the quality and length of play in my opinion.  It took me about four hours to play but I do play pretty fast (I think).  There is not much out there for KFHD in this genre so I gave it four stars because there is so little to compare to lately.  All in all it was a good game not a great game.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is incredibly similar to Super Scribblenauts but a ton cheaper. Still is pretty fun though. Would get it if you enjoy the series.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Never got dull. Graphics were nice and smooth. Challenging but not over board. And to play relaxed as well. Would definitely recommend

B000J5XS3C|2.0|it doesn't have a power button, that's annoying, You have to plug or unplug the power cord, that's not so good.
B002361MLA|5.0|One of the best books that I have ever read. It changed my life for ever.<br />Thank you Eckhart Tolle
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This little app does a pretty quick job of clearing out things that are lingering. I just wish it actually helped make my kindle fast again.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app had been really good up until recently when it started crashing every time I tried to pin something.
B00BEU19ZU|5.0|I like to travel all over the globe and find this app very helpful. It gives detailed airport and flight information. In addition it also shows hotel information.
B008602KQI|4.0|PRETTY GOOD SHOW. MAYBE A LITTLE TOO VIOLENT FOR KIDS UNDER 10. NOW I WANT TO SEE THE 2ND MOVIE.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I'm as big an AIC fan as anybody, I remember becoming a fan when I saw the premier of Man in a Box on MTV. While I miss Layne big time, Jerry Cantrell was as important to the distinctive AIC sound as Layne was and BGWTB definately has the AIC sound. The album reminds me alot of Cantrell's early 00's release Degredation Trip, I love the album. If you were a fan of the original AIC, you'll enjoy this. Even the revamped band with Duvall is better than 99% of the other garbage out there.
159463176X|3.0|\\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" is not nearly as emotionally satisfying as Hosseni's two previous novels.  Of the three novels, this one is the most \\"literary\\" and ambitious in that it involves multiple characters that are sometimes only remotely connected to the two people at the core of the author's story - and is largely told in flashbacks.<br /><br />These two, a brother and sister in a remote Afghan village, are separated in a surprising way that forever changes their lives and those of their descendants.  Surprisingly, however, after the children are split apart, Hosseini spends as much time exploring the lives of those who cross their paths as he does on his \\"main characters.\\"  It is not at first always clear who some of these people are and, frankly, some of their stories are rather boring and do not add much to the mix.  The result is that I, as an admirer of the author's two previous novels, found myself struggling to get through the last one-third or so of \\"And the Mountains Echoed.\\"<br /><br />The novel explores family loyalty, personal sacrifice, family betrayal, and the nature of memory, heredity, and \\"luck of the draw\\" life.  I think that Hosseini fans will want to read this one based on their experience with the author's previous work - just be aware that his approach to it is very different from the one he took with his two previous books.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Perhaps it is because I don't read enough at a sitting, but the story has many characters engaged in long conversations and makes many leaps in time. It was hard for me to follow the lives of all of the individuals and understand the general flow and purpose of the story.
B00E6887H0|4.0|Wow.  I did a double-take when I saw this album.  Cooder hasn't let out anything live since the late 1970's when even I was young.  There's a \\"live\\" album of (maybe) a live/studio set, and a live set from the mid 70's on a funky label that's been floating around--and (except for possible bootlegs) that's it.  But this fine recording (from 2011) is representative of Cooder's recent work and older favorites, and is a welcome addition to his overall work--both old  and newer songs alike.  The cover graphic should give you an idea of what this might sound like--and you're right.  Cooder with a few of his musical friends and a brass band.  And not just any band, but a  10 piece Mexican brass band, which colors and fleshes out the music keeping with Cooder's style.  Included are two drummers, three trumpets, Sousaphone, trombone, two clarinets, alto sax, bass sax, and an alto horn--with some members playing more than one instrument.  There's clapping and shouting  from the audience mostly between songs (whatever happened to people listening quietly?), so if that bothers you're enjoyment of the music, you've been warned.<br /><br />Cooder's son Joachim is on drums.  His longtime associate/friend Flaco Jimenez plays the accordion. And his sound (as always) is perfect for this music.  The vocalists (especially Terry Evans) are never less than good.  Together they take these songs and breathe new life into them.  This isn't some dry, traditional sounding album of Cooder's tunes and a few historical/pop songs.  Rather it's full of that \\"Spanish soul\\" that Cooder plays so well.  Just listen to  Billy Emerson's \\"Crazy 'Bout An Automobile\\"  (Cooder's dirty guitar is just right), or Woody Guthrie's \\"Do Re Mi\\" (Jimenez' accordion lends this tune a great feel), or (and here's the clincher) Sam The Sham's \\"Wooly Bully\\" (with a great back-beat, accordion, and vocals from just about everyone.<br /><br />And listen to Chips Moman's and Dan Penn's 's \\"The Dark End Of The Street\\".  To my ears James Carr's version is still the best--untouchable.  But they take this song full of pleading and heartbreak and give it their own identity well worth hearing.  Once again Cooder's restrained guitar suits this song perfectly.  And listen to the world weary vocals.  Cooder's \\"El Corrido de Jesse James\\" fits well with the older tunes with a great vocal.  Another Guthrie tune, \\"Vigilante Man\\", is suitably ominous thanks to Cooder's atmospheric guitar and the relatively spare backing.  Even that old favorite Huddie Ledbetter's \\"Goodnight Irene\\" seems to fit just right into this great set of songs.  The (slow/mid) tempo is on the mark and the vocals fit perfectly, with Jimenez' accordion and Cooder's guitar adding just the right amount of flavoring.  Obviously a great ending to this fine set of music.  This is one of those albums that benefits greatly by increasing the volume a bit when you sit down to hear this great set of songs/performances.<br /><br />I only wish this set could've contained more music--even a 2CD set--but I'm being selfish.  After Cooder's recent \\"story\\" albums, this live set is a nice surprise.  Fans who might have dropped by the wayside recently after hearing Cooder's recent albums will want to come back into the fold.  Cooder fans need to check this out.  A nice album to sit back and listen to, but no doubt great to witness in person.  Listen to \\"Volver Volver\\" (especially) and you'll hear what I mean.  The sound is very good--not sterile, yet clean with a slightly \\"lived in\\" feel to it.  The CD slips inside a pocket in the tri-fold cardboard package.  Inside there's a list of the songs, production credits, band personnel, and a couple of photos of the band--there's no booklet.ears James Carr's version is still the best--untouchable.

0767812166|5.0|Great movie with a twist on the visiting &#34;starman&#34;.  Jeff Bridges plays it in a most believable way.  Can't wait for him to come back.  This is one of a series of Jeff Bridges movies that would make a great collection.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey Stirling's music is inspiring.  This album appeals across the board to every member of my family from 80 yrs old to 12 yrs and that is fairly amazing for one style of music to appeal to so many.  Great job, Lindsey.  Keep it up.  We all look forward to hearing more from you and your magic violin.

B001AMNL2Q|4.0|I can't say it was some sort of masterpiece.<br />But interesting it was.  The drill sergeant steals the movie.<br />The ending was surreal when all those guys are in search and destroy mode and they are singing the theme song to a show they grew up watching.  It makes some sort of statement.  I am still thinking about it, but it seems to suggest we are programmed in our childhood.  And when we join the armed forces we are programmed again, but this time to kill.  I don't think I will ever forget the ending of this movie...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show definitely has the ability to take me for a loop. The acting is amazing and the storyline is awesome, the writers definitely know what they are doing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Nice show! High quality streaming and no tv ads. Good service for a low price. Defenitly worth having for family entertainment.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I bought this so I could back up my photos while I am on vacation. I have tested it at home, and it transfers photos quickly. I tried to use it on my iPhone, but it apparently only works on iPad. Overall, a good product.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This movie is engaging but not riveting. It took too long to get to the most interesting part.  Even then, the consequence of the revelation was not pursued deeply enough.  The sequel should be better, if there is one.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Well written and captivating. Would recommend to all in search of an alternative read. On to the next book. Enjoy
B002MFULQO|5.0|Excellent movie, a real eye opener. Kevin Costner is amazing and the acting is superb. It is.based in New Orleans
B003B1X80Y|4.0|Of course, the movie is never as good as the book, but still a very good movie, good actors, beautiful scenery, good story.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|I got tired of the commercials that pop up after every scene. I ended up deleting this game because of that.
B004EPZ070|5.0|For once the brunette wins over the blond!!  Thought Rachel and Dex made the perfect couple...good story.  I'm still amazed by the fact that &#34;the powers that be&#34; feel they must insert four-letter words into a film for ????

B0024FAR5W|4.0|I enjoyed this first season quite a bit and it makes me hopeful for what's to come. While I liked the first half of the season, I didn't feel like the show really gelled until the second half, with the introduction of the vicious ATF agent they truly found a focus and a story line to build towards that made the first part of the season seem inferior and paled in comparison. That said, there is excellent production values from beginning to end, the acting is great throughout and the directing, while for the most part not revolutionary, is adequate and like the show improves toward the end of this season. I'm eagerly anticipating starting season 2.
B006WM2FFS|5.0|An excellent story line based on history, supplemented by cinematography that provides a visual feast - truly worth the price paid, truly worth revisiting more than once!! I really enjoyed this film.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|I watched this because I like the actors and with the aged star power present, it had promise.  However, the script and storyline were awful.  Spend your time watching something else.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|Yes, i like it, and I will likely revisit it several time. The cinematography is wonderful, the story line deviates a bit from Tolkein, but until the trilogy is complete I won't know if the film version will work. The actors are definitely wonderful as well.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|I spent the whole time watching this concert squinting... trying to see what was going on through a veil of filters, haze, slow motion, montages, etc.  It's like watching a movie in a room full of smoke or cobwebs.  Why not just film the thing in high quality high definition with good camera angles and let the performance speak for itself?  If it's just due to cover her age, get over it.  Fans know how old she is, and we don't care.  We don't expect her to look 20.  She looks great.  I should not buy a blu ray at 1080 pixels to then wonder why there is film grain and effects like I am watching this on YouTube at 360 pixels or lower.  Please, re-release a version of all Madonna concerts post 2001 with mild editing and no effects.  This is just awful.  Just film the stage please!  I didn't even make it to the end.  It gives me a headache trying to figure out what is happening on the stage because the performance seems a million miles away!  I'm sure the concert was great - I guess I'll never know.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Also, as others have stated, the surround sound on the blu ray is terrible!  I have a 5.1 surround sound system, and kept having to get up to check if my speakers were working.  The bass is almost non-existant and her voice sounds very muffled and has a lot of echo like it is in a tin can.  I first thought it was to match the video looking like it was shot on someone's cheap cell phone, but now realize it is defective audio.  I really cannot recommend this product at all.  Her releases just keep getting botched (remember the Celebration Video Collection quality?).  If you have the chance to see Madonna live, do it!  It's a true experience you will never forget.  But it seems the days of her concerts being presented in a high quality video format are over.  It's such a shame and lost opportunity!  It didn't have to be this difficult to appropriately record and present the show in the highest quality.  The frustrating thing is, you know the footage exists to do this.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Don't know how to write about this without giving it away...I loved this book, even though it was utterly depressing.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I really liked this story!  I love dogs and I love reading about how they can be trained.  I was kept interested by the characters!  Loved how they developed a relationship.  I loved the intense suspense!  It is the best Nora Roberts books EVER!  And actually I enjoyed it so much that I read it twice!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fast paced game also very mental as it gets faster. Playing this game everyday on break and at school is very relaxing and fun to play on a day to day basis.
1616551607|5.0|I think this is possible the best artwork book i ever purchased. The quality of the illustrations is beautiful and the covers are also something else. It's a must have for any old-Final Fantasy fan. It certainly poor in the FF7 and FF8 side; but it covers (for me) a lot on the best FFs (FF4, FF6 and FF9).<br /><br />This is how all artbooks should be.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|If you've seen this series, you want to have the DVD for EACH season.  Once it's no longer on the air, you will NEED to have the DVD's to turn to.  The series is even more addictive than the product Walter White made.  Season One is the beginning of an amazing journey for Walt, Skyler, R.J., Jesse, Hank and Marie -- you don't want to miss out on a minute of it!
1603425381|5.0|I am with a group called Project Linus.  We do a lot of fleece blankets with a crochet edge.  Our group often refers to the edge on our blankts by pattern number.  This is how familiar we are with this book.  There are probably 100 copies floating around our membership.
B007DA2FHG|4.0|Very well done - tear jerker with happy ending!  Unbelievably good story.  Only reason I didn't rate it higher is that it's not funny or high thriller - different type of film.  Film scenes are very realistic & well done.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|The psychological accuracy of this depiction of the overwhelming impact and aftermath of a major disaster makes it a gripping movie to watch, but i need a tissue handy. We run workshops for psychologists and other mental health professionals, and for emergency first-responders and community counsellors, on post-disaster interventions. This movie is on our must watch list, along with the relevant research and practice reading, to give people a realistic appreciation of what their survivors or patients have experienced. It's the best practical and ethical way I've found of building empathy.<br />Dr Bob Montgomery, Clinical & Health Psychologist, Australia.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I didn't start watching this show until season 2 because the name and commercials never did that much for me, but after a friend recommended it to me I gave it a shot and now I am addicted!!  The story lines, acting and filming are all top notched.  I have no complaints at all, everyone of the actors do an amazing job!  Give it a shot, I guarantee you will be hooked!
B000VSAEYI|4.0|I bought this pool for my son, who was 12 months old at the time. We had just moved into a new house with a big back yard, and given how much he loves to play in the tub, I felt sure he would like this pool. Unfortunately, he just didn't like it. The floor of the pool can get pretty slippery--potentially more slippery than normal since I had the pool on the hardwood deck, not on the grass. His hand slipped once while crawling and he was very hesitant to get back in after that. Even after putting it away for a month.<br /><br />He did love leaning over the inflated sides of the pool and playing with his toys in the water. Basically he used it like a giant water table.<br /><br />We never had a problem with holes or leaks. I'm hoping it will stay intact over the winter and my son will be old enough to enjoy it next summer.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I know that I am not even close to being the first to voice this question.  So many great actors in this one, I can't even begin to name them all.  I think because it was early in the Sci-Fi Channel's development and programming a lot of people just completely missed out on this one.  Great show, wished it had more than one season though.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have heard people speak of these types of experiences before this. I have wanted to believe there was life after, and now there is proof.

B00CWVF2GC|4.0|I saw the first movie several years ago, and remember it quite well.  I thought it was a very real an honest movie that just happened to be gay-themed as well.  This movie picks up several years after the first movie, and I really liked that we see the affect the loss of his lover has had on Yossi.  It was played very real.  Even though he has become a successful doctor, we see that he is still aimless and lost.  And I liked that he finds someone who renews hope in him.  This is a really good movie, but one needs to watch Yossi & Jagger first to really understand what is happening in this movie.
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|This is an excellent roots cd in the fine tradition of not only The Staple Singers but the string of fine unplugged and rootsy Americana CDs Mavis has released over the last decade for Anti Records and Alligator Records.
B007NVIB5U|3.0|The American version was much better.  It had better character development to it than I found with this one.  The actor who played the man whore in this series just wasn't as believable, but I liked the young kid better in this one than the American version.  All in all, though, I am glad I watched this one since it was the original and I could see where many of the ideas for the American version originated.

B00C5W3SBE|4.0|I loved the film, I had always wondered about the Wizard and finally after all these years I got to see. Honestly I think Voltaire would have made a better Oz than James Franco but his performance improved with the film. I definitely recommend seeing this film.

B0009P5YXO|3.0|The good:  It looks and sounds the part, barely.<br /><br />The bad:  I noticed chipped paint after taking it out of the box.  Sound effect volume is on the low side.

055358894X|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Some people disliked the swearing, but that did not bother me.  I was a bit jarred at the way the author alternates chapters which are told at two different times in the character's timeline.  I did get used to it though, and I understand what the author was trying to do.  Would it have worked better if he had told a more linear story, and let the hooks and teasers of Locke's youth become apparent later in the story?  Not sure.  I did find it a rather unusual way to tell the story, and I did enjoy it.<br />Some things were telegraphed far in advance, some things turned and took me by complete surprise.  I like that the story was able to do that.<br />The world that the author has created is intriguing.  I find I would love to know more of its history and about the lands surrounding the City.
B008PNBU30|3.0|After hearing this album, I wasn't surprised to hear of the lead singer's departure. One-X is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I have enjoyed all their others. This one is quite a disappointment.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it is so different from everything else that I have read as of late. I particularly liked the way the author used vintage photographs as inspiration for the children and their stories. I simply cannot wait for the next installment.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums, honestly. They have others that are so-so, but even our young kids like this one. It's nice to share something with them that is parent and kid-friendly (since they like pop and we like heavy stuff). Our 3-year-old even loves &#34;Ta-tower&#34; and sings it endlessly.<br /><br />This is definitely Shinedown's best.
B00CFYAT6O|1.0|First and foremost, it is undoubted Susan Tedeschi is powerful and soulful vocalist and Derek Trucks is a distinguished guitarist who is also occupied by Allman Brothers Band and Eric Clapton but it should also be noted that by the time of recording their third album reviewed here, Tedeschi Trucks Band has already evolved into a musical institution succeeding in it during quite a short period of time.<br /><br />Every work done needs a lot of efforts not from the authors only but from the side-people like composers, producers, record label executives, marketing managers etc. and we appreciate it. But we are talking about the final goal, the crown of these efforts, the produce and not the efforts to get this produce done. Produce, for the purpose of the present review, is the music and what we hear is, distinctly is, a collection of boring and resembling songs packed into well-positioned brand's packing.<br /><br />The trend is determining here. If \\"Revelator\\" included some Blues, \\"[[ASIN:B00ECUX7HC Made Up Mind]]\\" has no Blues in, no Blues at all. Generally, institutions don't deliver high quality music simply because institution is a business and frequently, if not always, sacrifices musical likings (both of own and of listener) for earthbound goals.<br /><br />Why we make accent on album's no-Blues orientation? Because \\"[[ASIN:B00ECUX7HC Made Up Mind]]\\" was positioned as a Blues album and, therefore, is widely recognized as a \\"Blues\\" album which it is not. So, what is it?  Is it a soul work? Or maybe a retro-soul? Or maybe just retro? These are questions of lesser significance but if the music played on \\"[[ASIN:B00ECUX7HC Made Up Mind]]\\" has to be called Blues, then Blues is dead.<br /><br />pastblues.com
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|The character portrayals were quite good.  The story was a little rough to hear (but understandable in the time period the movie was made for). I was surprised at all the good actors and enjoyed the movie.  Thought the ending could have been refined a bit though.  Did not really fit right in the last two minutes!

B0068LYEHA|5.0|This is a book to be read by all women and most men!  Caitlin is great at describing exactly how women feel about such issues as menstruation, clothes, their bodies, and even abortion, in what seems to be a tongue-in-cheek manner, but actually hits the old nail on the head!.  She's witty and sarcastic and I loved this book.
B005MMY534|4.0|This was excellent 1st season of a series.  Can't understand why this wasn't picked up.  Acting was first rate, casting spot-on, locations believable, lighting & set design evocative.  Costumes seemed a little &#34;strange.&#34;  Fabrics, textures not realistic for time, but then again, as Costume Designer said, we really don't know what they wore.  Very surprised this was not optioned by other network/outlet/production company.  Still should be.  Confused why Camelot not renewed while so many tepid, mediocre series are renewed.  Plan on watching my purchased instant video season 1 multiple times.
B008JEJRQ2|5.0|Everything was great!  As far as the delivery. and packaging was concern. Haven't had any problems ever sence I started ordering Lps
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|I still remember when I first listened to Arctic Monkeys classic debut album \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\\".  Even just the title was intriguing.  It was one of the best post punk indie rock albums ever.  Also one of the best rock records in the 2000s.  The album had small success in the US, but did get a Grammy nomination.  Then a year later they released their second masterpiece in a row titled \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\".  I loved the slightly different musical direction of the album.  It was another classic, but still the US was almost ignoring the band!  Two years later they released \\"Humbug\\", which was also a great album.  It was more psychedelic and sometimes reminded me of \\"The Doors\\" and legendary bands from the 60s.  Then came what was honestly my least favorite album, \\"Suck It and See\\".  It was a great album, but definitely a step down for me.  I almost gave up on the band after that album.  Finally they released \\"R U Mine?\\" as a single.  It was the best song I've heard from the band in years.  Then came \\"Do I Wanna Know\\" and finally \\"Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?\\".  The band said the album took influences from Hip Hop, most notably \\"Dr Dre\\" and I could hear it in the lead singles.  Needless to say, I was sold and I couldn't wait to own the album.  Finally here it is, and it is truly an amazing collection of songs.  Here is a track by track review.<br /><br />1.  Do I Wanna Know?: The best single from the band since \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" in my opinion.  The pulsing hip hop beat will make you wanna clap along.  The guitar riff is destined to become a classic.  The way Alex muses the verses is perfect.  The song is getting recognition in the US and I'm glad!  Definitely one of my favorites.  10/10<br />2.  R U Mine?: At first I thought this was just gonna be a stand alone single.  Then it was included in the album.  Really a great rocker song reminiscent of \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\".  More great guitars!  Great great song!10/10<br />3.  One For The Road: The song already starts smooth with a perfect chorus.  Then the hip hop bass kicks in.  Really does have that \\"Dr Dre\\" funky feel!  The guitar solo is tasty and the background chants of the chorus are candy for the ears.  10/10<br />4.  Arabella:  Another great hip hop beat and bass leads this song.  Then before you know it a Black Sabbath \\"War Pigs\\" sounding combination of guitars and drums kicks in.  Its really energizing!  9.5/10<br />5.  I Want It All:  Nice guitars in the song.  For some reason I hear an \\"Outkast\\" influence in the vocals of the chorus! 9/10<br />6.  No.1 Party Anthem: Many would assume from the title that this would be a pumping party song.  Wrong!  This is a beautiful ballad along the lines of \\"505\\" and \\"Cornerstone\\".  I think this makes those other ballads seem boring, because this one is just so perfect!  I don't know what else to say.  Great song to calm you down in the middle of the album!  10/10<br />7.  Mad Sounds: Another great ballad with a \\"Beatles\\" sound to it.  I thought the other ballad would be the only good one on the album.  But this was also just beautiful!  The \\"Oooo la la laaaa\\" parts are just soothing and gorgeous!  10/10<br />8.  Fireside: The beat of this song is urgent and mysterious!  There are great backing vocals chanting \\"shoo wop shoo wop\\" so infectiously during the chorus!  The last half of the song gets even better and sexy!  Another perfect song.  10/10<br />9.  Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?\\"  This song.  This song has the biggest \\"Dr Dre\\" influence as evident in the thumping groovy bass!  The smooth and sexy vocals.  The sexy chorus.  The sexy backing vocals!  This song is just sexy and amazing.  10/10<br />10.  Snap Out of It: A nice clapping song!  Of course the chorus is just delicious!  9.5/10<br />11.  Knee Socks:  This is my new favorite song from the band.  The guitars are great.  The vocals are some of the best from Alex and so smooth.  The chorus is the sexiestI've heard from any band in a long time.  Try not to get the chorus stuck in your head I dare you.  This would be a great single!  I thought track 9 would be the sexiest, but this definitely steals the cake!  11/10<br />12.  I Wanna Be Yours:  This ballad has a slow hip hop beat, but nice beautiful psychedelic guitars.  Again the chorus is slow sexy perfection.  This song is great to play for someone you want to fall in love with you.  Nice relaxing way to end this nearly perfect album. 10/10<br /><br />So this album was consistently great.  There were no tracks I would skip.  Many can agree this is the bands best album since the \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\".  But I can truthfully say that this might be my favorite from the band altogether!  This album is very sexy in its feel and vibe.  Also a great soundtrack for single people, mostly men.  I feel this might finally open the US eyes to the greatness of this band again!  They deserve all the recognition they get.  Arctic Monkeys fans, this is a must buy.  If you're new to the band, this is also a great album to get introduced to the band.  Another timeless masterpiece.  Also one of the few albums that got the \\"Hip Hop\\"/\\"Rock\\" vibe perfect!  Well worth the money!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Normally I don't take the time to review novels/stories unless they fall on either side of the good/bad spectrum. This is one of those series that falls on the very good end of the spectrum of writing. Hugh Howey's writing is both fluid and engaging.
1476727910|2.0|This was a book that would have been better as a short story.  The characters were all pretty shallow, and the plot fairly familier.  Reminded me of Robert Heinleins many shorts from the fifties.  Only Heinleins characters would be better developed and funnier.

B00DSTBMMU|3.0|she has always had  hybrid cuts in her career which lead themselves to a blend of Country and Pop with a few other styles tossed in,however her problem is that she hasn't expanded as a vocalist and the songwriting is par for the course. it doesn't add or take away from her career and catelog so far. her past few albums felt like they were phoned in and this is a bit better. musically she is at home and its middle of the road and commerical sounding so she should be cool,however she peaked and hit her prime back in the 90's easily.

B00DNDR29I|2.0|straight up she needs a Bruno Mars to write and produce a good half of a record for her to give her that foot in the door hit. she has everything going for her, however she lacks that personality that works on record for me.  and this album at times feels like a 80's  throwback attempt to some of the stuff Prince use to do and he is featured on the album and well unless you are getting him at his 80's peak and prime well its sounding  dated and played out in 2013.  to me she has broadway musical artist written all over her a modern day Vanessa L.Williams thing where you make albums as a hobby or for fun. her and Badu do  a broke Klymaxx Meeting in the Ladies room on their duet which never heats up.  the Broke Nona Hendrix  attempt just feels contrived and needs an overhaul.<br /><br />she has something their, however she ain't got the right person writing and producing it it. she is very polished and alot of showmanship, however the bottom line is  MIA.<br /><br />if she ever finds that money track and who she is as a artist, then she will look back and hear the difference, if not being a lounge act at the holiday inn at 3 in the morning or the next big musical is always an option.

B00AYB0TOW|2.0|My only experience with Judge Dredd prior to this was the original movie with Stalone, so I have no reference on how true this one was to the comic.  Before watching this I heard a lot of comparisons of Die Hard meets Robocop.  For me, that comparison was way off the mark.  What made Die Hard so great was Bruce Willis' character John McClane...the every day guy stuck in the most non everyday situation.  That's what made the character so likable.  There was nothing like that here. Dredd was every bit as sterile as cyborg Murphy when he first rolled off the line, and that was it.  With Murphy, you saw some character development with him trying to find his way between his human side and his robot side.  Nothing like that here.  If you're looking for one big long gun fight with a lot of heads exploding, then this will do it for you.  If you're looking for an actual story line, you've come to the wrong place.

0143039482|5.0|The Nobel Prize winning novel (1962) examines this question: Can one take a respite from good morals, do things totally out of character, and then switch back to good? That is the dilemma our protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, faces as he struggles to regain past family wealth and prominence. Published in 1961, this was the last novel that John Steinbeck finished. As with most of his novels, he was initially criticized for `making a mountain out of a molehill.' Steinbeck stated that he wanted to expose \\"the moral degeneration of American culture.\\" He was later exonerated when the details of Watergate and Richard Nixon proved his point. This is the writer that also wrote 'The Grapes of Wrath' (1939), displaying capitalism in a negative way and 'Of Mice and Men' (1937), emphasizing man's inhumanity to one another. If you haven't read a Steinbeck novel...start with this one.<br /><br />The novel's time period is from Easter to the Fourth of July (1960) in the fictional town of Baytown, NY. Steinbeck fashioned this town out of his own hometown of Sag Harbor, NY. We find ex-GI, Ethan Allen Hawley, working as a clerk in Marullo's Fruit and Fancy Groceries. While Ethan was fighting overseas in World War II, his father lost all the family's wealth via wild wartime investments. The language of the times is sometimes offensive, such as, Ethan referring to his boss as the guinea, wop, or dago. Two other families of prominence in the novel are heading in different directions. Mr. Baker is the town's banker and future political power, while Danny Taylor (from a good family) is now the town drunk. Ethan's wife, Mary (of many cutesy names), has been putting pressure on Ethan to improve the family's position.<br /><br />His children, Allen and Mary Ellen, have entered a `I love America' essay contest and also champion for a better life. Mary's friend, Margie Young- Hunt, has read her fortune cards and states that Ethan is going to be rich. Does Margie have a crush on Ethan? Mr. Baker wants Ethan to start investing in the town, and Ethan's friend Joey Morphy (a bank teller) informs Ethan how the perfect bank robbery could be done. Ethan learns that Marullo might have come to the USA without papers (thus the term WOP). Can he get the store for himself, if he `rats out' Marullo? Should he follow Mr. Baker's seemingly wrong and nefarious advice. Are the kids writing their essays on the up and up? Why is Mr. Baker bribing Danny Taylor with booze and what is that paper he wants Danny to sign? Is Ethan contemplating a bank robbery?<br /><br />Since this is a story of the decline in American morality, there are many flaws in the eight main characters. Ethan is not the only one with morality issues, but he is the only one with a guilty conscious. On page 201, Ethan thinks to himself, \\"Temporarily I traded a habit of conduct and attitude for comfort and dignity and a cushion of security.\\" He thinks he can change back to a good guy, since he killed people during the war and didn't become a murderer when he was discharged. The only shortcoming I found with this novel was that too much was packed into the last 59 pages. If he could have added a hundred pages, or so, the reader would have time to savor the many twist and turns that come at you one after another. The title of this classic comes from William Shakespeare's 'Richard III' . On page 264, Ethan toasted his son by saying, \\"Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York.\\" He will think different in a few pages. All in all, this is a marvelous story, so typical of a John Steinbeck novel.wants Ethan to start investing in the town, and Ethan's friend Joey Morphy (a bank teller) informs Ethan how the perfect bank robbery could be done.

B00B4FU6KE|5.0|The premise of this book is brilliant ... I feel lucky that I began it without a clue about the story.  The voice of Fowler's protagonist is as original as the story itself, resulting in a novel I could not put down.
0425261360|1.0|This book is the first I've read by Patricia Cornwell and it most definitely will be the last!  The plot, characters and dialogue are unlikeable, unbelievable and unreadable!  I've never been so annoyed just trying to finish a book...editing also pitiful in every way.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a fantastic match 3 game.  Great graphics, very touch responsive.  Fun and addictive, each game has you collecting pieces for various artifacts that you will have to place correctly in certain levels.  The levels are timed and you must collect all the pieces to advance (which can be frustrating when you only have one piece left to collect when time runs out), but the game is so fun I usually do not mind. Definitely worth the price.

I highly recommend this book.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I had read the Kite Runner after reading good reviews and was glad I did.  When I saw this book written Husseini, I wanted to see if he could continue to hold my attention.  I will definitely read any of his works.  I really like his style of writing.
B00E8AVNAE|5.0|the movie was packaged excellent and came as described the movie had action and a very good plot. It also came with a great purchase price.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Had to have a copy for myself to watch again and again.  Love Patrick Swayze, miss him.
B000B589JI|2.0|Try as I would I could not get this little container to stop leaking.  It's a great idea but the makers will have to design a better seal if it is going to be of any use to me.
B000P0J09W|5.0|My daughter is in her thirties and this movie has always been one of her favorites.  Saving it for her Christmas.
034580709X|4.0|After the Steig Larrson trilogy I looked for another Scandinavian writer and have been very pleased with all of Jo Nesbo's books.  Recommend it highly.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I had seen this before and wanted my own copy to watch again and again.  Great for all ages.  Would definitely recommend..
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Watched the whole season 1 in one weekend. Tremendous character and plot development. Always keeps you guessing. Too bad Season 2 is not on Amazon Prime yet. Ordered the DVD set to get ready for Season 3 on 9/29.
B006KYXR3C|4.0|Legend of the Guardians is a classic good vs evil type movie.  I am not sure how it compares to the books but the plot of the movie is far from boring and easy to follow.  Like many other reviewers stated the animation is VERY crisp and detailed and is worth watching just for that reason alone!  This is a great little movie that didn't garner a whole lot of attention at the theaters but still ended up impressing me.  I would definitely recommend you watching or even owning this one!  It's a great flick for people of all ages.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|usually have movies figured out, this one threw me for a loop and had me guessing the whole time.  good movie for sure.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Nothing to write home about.<br />Some very good visual effects with long, boring..  almost unrelated material inbetween.<br />And the actors communicate (via there &#34;phone-it-in&#34; performances) their disinterest..  making this film must have been a distraction from more interesting projects for all of them.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Love this movie! I have watched it over and over again. Can't wait to watch it again. Thank you very much!
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|I did not have enough memory in my phone to download this app. I wanted it for my wife because they play Majong in the Philippines where she is from. Oh well things happen, and this was entirely my fault, but the battery charger wasn't. My battery charger has 3 prongs and the one I received has 2 and it does not work at all. Thanks God I found my old Can in charger.<br />Best Regards,<br />Jerald
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|The ending really tied the story together until then  it is pretty much a children's movie, probably pre teen only. Scary at a few scenes but the original Wizard of Oz is still one of the scariest pictures out there for children. I watched it but was easily distracted while playing games on my laptop!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|really fun -could waste lots of time trying to master all the levels and collect all the coins. Go get em tiger.,
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|Best application I have found yet.  Wish the apllication worked better with antivirus.  Would give 5 stars if allowed at least one free license to remote when roaming.
B000I3UAJ0|4.0|Good quality glad I rented it but I was expecting the director's edition and that's apparently not what this was, I don't blame Amazon though I don't think I researched the right one when i rented overall very happy with quality of the stream
B00EEN7CAK|1.0|Very boring, bad acting...I wanted to leave the theater but I always expected something to turn me on, nothing did happen the whole time, left very disappointed...
B009JBZH54|5.0|the dark knight trilogy is awesome each movie great in its own right. cant call yourself a batman fan...heck you cant call yourself a comic book fan without owning this. this is a must buy
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Lots of Hollywood CGI and Magic acts that aren't possible, but still an entertaining movie.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B002ZG981E|5.0|weather you understood the ending or not (and i know the truth) this is a great movie that everyone should get
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|While the production value is clearly lower than Stallone's &#34;Judge Dredd&#34;, this take on the Dredd series is decidedly closer to the look and feel of the comic.  Carl Urban does a relatively good job of pulling off the character of Dredd. Also, unlike the other movie, you never see his face, which is the way it should be :-).  Olivia Thirlby does a good job as Anderson and doesn't over act it.  The &#34;slow-mo&#34; scenes had a great use of color and possibly the least-annoying use of &#34;slowing down time&#34; that I've seen in a movie.<br /><br />All-in-all, if you're looking for an action flick that's kind of dark, watch Dredd.
B007EECSFA|3.0|Took awhile to interest me, not as good as The Distant Hours or The Secret Garden, but about a quarter of the way, the story and secrets took hold and I enjoyed the read and final twists.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|The kids and I all love this game.  It has so much to do!  It is hard to earn peanuts, but still fun!!
B00DQVST76|2.0|I received it today and had my heart broken cause the sound on the BlurRay is totally off. Returning it for the DVD and hoping it sounds better.
6304711905|5.0|Tombstone is one of the best westerns of all time.  The cast assembled to tell the story of Wyatt Earp is one to be remembered for sure.  Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer in particular played their parts exceptionally well.  It is certainly one of my favorite western movies.
B0081336FO|5.0|One of BBC's best shows thus far. Absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. Can't wait for series 3 to start!
B003L77G10|5.0|I NOW KNOW WHY THIS SHOW IS SO CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED.  I RECOMMEND THIS SERIES FOR ANYONE WHO FEELS THE NEED TO CATCH UP ON THIS SHOW THAT IS STARTING IT'S 5TH SEASON IN 2013.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love the dynamic between Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Dr John Watson (Martin Freeman) in this adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes. It keeps your interest and wanting more. Kudos to Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss!
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|Let me just preface by saying, if you've never seen Ghostbusters there is no excuse for skipping over such an incredible piece of cinema. The writing of this film is still witty, magnificent and well executed on all levels. Folks, they just don't make them like this<br />anymore. Perhaps what I love the most is that even with remaster after remaster, they NEVER changed any of the special effects!<br />Somebody call George Lucas and slap this bluray in his face and show him that despite having out of date visual FX,  this is wayyyyyyy better than re-tooling or changing something that does not need it in the first place.<br />As for the bluray itself the transfer is a big improvement over the last release. The contrast is not overblown, so all of those details<br />that should have been visible in the last bluray actually are now. Color is more accurate and natural too. Thanks to the improved transfer , more fine details emerge (transparency of the ectoplasm, textures on clothing etc, the sky actually having visible clouds in some scenes due to the finer tuning of the contrast). Dark scenes (there are lots) look great, still detailed and they didn't dial back the grain so it has that nice film look (as it should). Sound is great on this disc, mastered nicely, sometimes flat BUT when proton packs are used or catastrophies happen, the surround kicks in big time, Dialog is clear and center. I DO NOT have a 4k TV but despite what some other reviews have stated, there is a noticeable difference in quality over the last release. If you are a videophile or a Ghostbusters fan, do yourself a favor and buy this disc.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great movie a must watch if you love good music. You get to see the making of an art form amazing
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This is the best free book I've downloaded so far.  It covers everything you need to know to format, edit and upload your book to Kindle.  Easy to follow, step by step instructions, a good TOC and clear writing. I went through it chapter by chapter and was amazed at how easy the process is.  Includes advice on sizing your cover illustration, using tables and headings, and internal graphics. I could have used a bit more detail on the marketing aspects, such as keywords and categories, but that information is available elsewhere, and this is a detailed handbook on how to go from your word processor to the finished product.  Recommended to anyone who wants to get their book out properly and quickly.
B0052GACNM|3.0|How can you not love anything Tony B. sings?  But this is still inferior to the first Cd, Duets I.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I loved the movie. I epsecially loved the part of the story where two people took in another at which they became friends just by someone caring enough
1250030951|5.0|Rainbow Rowell, you are a goddess. It's like you heard all my rants about New Adult. It's like you knew that the genre could be so much more and decided you'd give it a shot. And then because of your awesomeness, you suddenly became one of my auto-buy authors.<br /><br />Ten Likes/Dislikes:<br /><br />1. (+) Cath, the protagonist - In perusing reviews about Fangirl, it seems that the most divisive topic is Cath, and whether you like Cath will affect your entire experience of the book. I don't think that you necessarily need to identify with Cath so much as feel for her situation. Cath comes to college with a slew of social anxiety--and sometimes it's painful to watch. She's shy and bereft of her former BFF sister, Wren, who refused to room with her. She stays in her room instead of going to the dining hall because she's scared (of the new situation? of being without her sister? of her beautifully confident older roommate?), doesn't know much about campus (and calls 911 when walking about at night; very smart, very self-conscious), and has established a routine of eating protein bars instead of actual food. She retreats when afraid, when her safety net has been destroyed. This situation is summed by: \\"In new situations, all the trickiest rules are the ones nobody bothers to explain to you. (And the ones you can't Google.).\\" Would it bother you to read about someone who's lost in the beginning? Personally I didn't experience the same sort of anxiety that Cath did when I started college, but I know some people who did and I could picture it clearly. And when Cath came out of her shell, her fantastic character shined. She's not just the reclusive writer of a popular fanfiction but also a brave, loyal, funny, easily hurt introverted girl with unflinching principles and heart. Although she's a tad judgmental regarding drinking/partying/etc., I could admire her bravery for not falling for peer pressure and for her desire to care for her sister even when Wren wasn't the nicest person. She's not perfect--far from it--but a lot of her vulnerabilities are things you can easily relate to. My feelings on Cath align closely with those stated in this review.<br /><br />2. (+) World-building AKA College Setting - Unlike Cath, I didn't go to a big state university, but the college scene is generally portrayed well. From the assignments Cath receives from her creative writing professor to the feel of the college library where she works on an assignment with a friend to managing your social life along with your school work to not always knowing where everything is on your suddenly somehow large campus to your finals appearing out of nowhere to the frenzied energy of freshmen SO READY FOR THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE --- yes, everything set the scene wonderfully.<br /><br />3. (+) Romance - I found it fairly obvious who the romantic interest would be from the start, but don't read this section if you're super afraid of spoilers. Never have I thought that I'd find an extrovert who smiles at everyone and is so jolly about life actually attractive, especially since he doesn't like to read. Levi is the charmer, the social one who's always on good terms with others and who you can always count on (to do any good deed), the one who you can't help liking but who has vulnerable sides too. Levi's charisma is so catchy that even when he does something terrible, you, like Cath, will eventually forgive him. And I also didn't think a receding hairline could be attractive but again Rowell surprises me. Opposites attract? Definitely in this novel. Plus, neither Levi nor Cath change who they are while they are dating.<br /><br />4. (+) Nostalgia - I read this back in May, not long after I'd graduated from college, and oh my god, the nostalgia. So perfectly portrayed. The dining hall experience, the people watching, the creative writing professor who's anti-fan fiction for Cath but was anti-genre for me, the months that are like years in collegespeak, the dorm room life, social and otherwise, the confusion over what exactly this new experience would entail, decorating your room with your roommate, the shock of meeting your new roommate, adjusting (from being a social misfit--or continuing to be one), the shock of classes and the work and suddenly all coalescing... However, since this was written from nerdy Cath's perspective, there's not much to see about the party perspective or drinking (well, besides Judgment on her twin, Wren). In fact, there's almost a stigma because every stupid character decision seems to result from that person having been drunk or drinking and Wren especially doesn't do anything in moderation. There is definitely a danger as a freshman of overdoing yourself, but it didn't seem like you got to see someone in moderation being okay. But that's totally a personal preference, and one thing you'll have to do is reconcile that your experiences may also be different from Cath's, even with the wonderfully portrayed nostalgia.<br /><br />5. (+) Fan fiction - Simon Snow is basically a weird mix of Twilight and Harry Potter (which for me answered the question of why HP still existed in this fictional world.). It alternates between Cath's story and the fan fiction she's writing for Simon Snow and her dedicated fans. I skimmed over the fan fiction because it didn't quite interest me, but regardless the appreciation of all fan fiction truly shows. In her acknowledgements, Rainbow Rowell confesses to having read a bunch of fan fiction, and it shows. It really, really shows, and thank you to Ms. Rowell for not shaming fan fiction as sometimes happens. This is the perfect book for people who've grown up with HP but might ask what comes next. Perfect book for fan fiction writers. Perfect for those who want to address tough questions on ownership and creative license. Perfect for writers in general because even though her creative writing professor doesn't accept fan fiction, she sees the potential in Cath and takes her writing seriously.<br /><br />6. (+) Character Cast - This is definitely a character-driven book. Reagan is Cath's spunky, loyal roommate who becomes her friend when she eases Cath out of her shell. She also likes to slam doors, is constantly in a hurry, and is a wonderful contrast to Cath's self-consciousness. Cath's twin, Wren, wants to meet new people and have new experiences separate from her twin because she wants something of her own. Problem is, she tries to do this in rather extreme terms, yet Cath can't help but remember all the good times with Wren, the times when they used to write Simon Snow fan fiction together. And of course, there's Cath's father who suffers from manic episodes but who's not defined by his mental illness. He's the perfect combination of quirky and loving, creative and energetic, strong and vulnerable. And Rowell gets bonus points for including a mentally ill character in the first place.<br /><br />7. (+) Character Growth - The best part about Cath's journey is not just the character growth that she undergoes but the realization that comes with it: that it's okay to be an introvert, to not jump wildly into the various college experiences but to ease yourself into the new situation. Coming-of-age here means handling a lot of drama and thriving in this scarily new place but doing so without changing who she fundamentally is: a hard-working nerd scholar who's socially awkward but so believable.<br /><br />8. (+) Writing - Although the writing didn't quite captivate me as it did with Eleanor and Park (all those descriptions! so beautiful!), the writing here still shines with authenticity. There's a lot of humor and realistic dialogue and wonderfully poignant situations that I think are captured quite well.<br /><br />9. (+/-) Pacing - There's a lot going on in this novel - the problems of college, socially and academically, the drama with her family and various other characters - but sometimes I find that pacing in character-driven stories can be slightly off. For me, this book was just a tad slow, a tad hard to get into at first.<br /><br />10. (+) Cover - What a perfect cover. Cath and her writing, Levi and his obsession with her name. The fan fiction (Baz and Simon are a form of Harry + Draco, no?). The colors and the font. So much love.<br /><br />Nerds. Introverts. Harry Potter fans (because even if it's a mix of HP & Twilight, it's mostly HP). Fanfiction writers. New Adult fans. YA fans disappointed with current NA work. YA fans. Fans of Gayle Forman, especially Just One Day. Fans of John Green and Stephanie Perkins, YA contemporary romance authors with truthful, believable narratives. Any mix of the above. This one is for you. I've pre-ordered my copy, and I hope you'll consider buying this book too.
B00355L2TU|4.0|I thought this would be simple, being as I've done workout videos in the past.  I never realized doing a simple jumping jack for 30 seconds could be so much work.<br /><br />The squats and lunges are hard on the knees, so make sure you follow Jillian's proper technique.  It won't hurt the knees then.  And I put a pillow under my knees for the push ups, because that was a little hard on my knees at this point.<br /><br />I will keep up with it and hopefully get the &#34;up to 20lbs&#34; lost she says can happen (that is my goal, so that works nicely). :)
B007SGM084|5.0|Love love love these books!!! Can't wait for the next book to come out!!!  Hopefully sooner than later!!! Recommend to everyone!!!

B008G3N71W|2.0|A Girl's Adventure started out as something I liked.  Girl meets boy, girl is interested in boy and girl is willing to see boy again...and then it just got weird...<br />Greta is a shop girl in London with a fairly quiet life and is bumped into by Richard on the Tube.  Richard is a nice looking guy and even though she's put off by his brashness in the crowded subway car, she goes ahead and calls him and agrees to go to his place.  Within seconds of arriving, Richard starts waving his freak flag all over the place and while I'm not a prude, a little bit of foreplay that didn't involve slapping and tearing of clothes would have gone a long way.<br />Richard has realized that he has found the perfect student in Greta and that she's easily trainable.  He proceeds to put her in many unusual and frequently public sexual situations before whisking her away to his country estate to begin the real training.<br />This book is more than your usual BDSM/Role Playing book.  There is sex in public, penetration with foreign objects, girl-on-girl situations and there are hints of bestiality.  Overall I think it was an attempt to cram every type of kink that Chloe Thurlow could put into one book and there were many times when it was just uncomfortable.  I felt that as a result of the author trying so hard to shock you, the story suffered and it's inconceivable that an entire town would participate in the pony races that Greta is trained for.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|Not a bad game but very disappointing with it wanting you to be connected to Facebook.  Play 35 levels to be told add 3 Facebook friends to get to next level of game.  Can't wait until we live in a country that Facebook is a thing of the past!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I agree. what good is this app if we can't even get the real game!<br />not very happy about this.

B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy this game. Lots of different sequences to play. You can stop and take a break & resume whenever. Enjoyable!
B00B4804KS|3.0|This movie is mostly all depth but it is a classic movie and they did a great job turning it into a 3D
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Mysterious beginning that hooks you in quickly. A little too much description of the story action. It is not<br />Always easy to follow but a very good story.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it.  Bingo, slots and fun.  Best bingo game around so far.  Only wish you would get more credits everyday so you could level up easier.
B00B19DW0E|4.0|A lot of my favorite films from this era don't stand up to rewatching in 2013. But Escape from New York doesn't have the outdated special effects of The Highlander or the hilariously poor dialogue of The Black Hole. It is what says on the tin, and an amusing way to spend a little while remembering what the 80's thought the late 90's might look like.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Best to watch from the beginning entirely. It is SO good. I LOVE IT! Would recommend to anyone on the planet!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|What a fun movie. Action packed and fast paced. Kept me involved the whole time. The plot is interesting without being overly complicated.
