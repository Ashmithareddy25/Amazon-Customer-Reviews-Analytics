B000VBGT3K|5|this product is a wonderful idea!  I bought it for a baby shower and the mommies to be loved it.  Most people at the shower hadn't seen this before... all around hit!
B00NF2LT50|5|Great, stylish bibs that my baby wears daily. These bibs not only look cool, they are also very absorbent. Good quality and soft materials. Would definitely recommend.
B0042D69WY|5|Our son had a very difficult time sleeping when he was an infant. He cried for 24 hours non stop when we first brought him home and I seriously contemplated giving him up for adoption or something. Of course we would never actually do that but we did go buy this Cradle/Swing and it really saved us. He would sleep very well whenever he was in it, so he spent more than 60% of his time in it for most of his first year. He's out grown it now so we're trying to re-sell ours, but I would highly recommend buying this for any new parents whose infants don't sleep well on their own.
B0080D5982|5|My grandson loves this toy!  He is such a bouncer and gets lots of exercise.
B00BH0P1E2|5|I bought this cup for my one year old. I wanted something with handles and easy to clean. I also knew she'd probably be drinking some sort of yogurt drink out of it. This cup is great!!! Other cups have been really hard to clean with non water beverages but this is easy in dishwasher or by hand. The straw is texturized inside so before going into dishwasher I put it under warm water and rub together. I like it so much I'm getting another one.
B00BAUZ0N6|4|you get what you pay for. this is my second levava...first one was expensive but lasted 12 hours a day for 3 years and still works pretty good. this new levana cuts on and off ranomly which makes a noise so it wakes me up, and has already lost a couple of pixels. also picture quality is low. but the sound quality is very good. was very affordable if you can over look the flaws.
B0042D69V0|5|Great price
B0063V3OXA|2|Good idea but not practical because it on.y has adhesive on two sides. My daughter tore this off tha table in one minute and tried to eat it
B004FPYG8S|3|These seem like great bottles, but my little one was not a fan of either the bottles or the pacifiers. She like the Moma bottles, and she never did end up using pacifiers.
B0028K2RME|1|Gave this away; never used because it doesn't attach to a car's seat as advertised, and you can't hear anything.  Lights and animals are cute, but that's where it ends.
B001ODAHF0|4|I think this is a good stroller overall, but here are the Pros and Cons in my opinion for it:    Pros:  - It reclines all the way and it's a one hand recline  - Smooth ride, you can maneuver it with one hand; at least on smooth surfaces  - Sturdy stroller  - Nice design  - Can be folded and picked up with one hand, while holding the baby with the other (opening would be a little more challenging, but doable)  Narrow fold  - Bigger wheels than most umbrella strollers, so I think it will hold on fine on gravel or less than perfect surfaces.  - It doesn't tilt back easily when hanging things from the handles and removing the baby from the stroller.    Cons:  - It really is not a \\"light\\" stroller; it takes less space than travel system strollers, but is not much lighter.  - Long when folded (not necessarily a con, but it takes length space in the trunk. The width is good.  - Small basket, but it fits a small diaper bag or large purse under it.  - It only holds up to 40 lbs, but my oldest didn't hit that weight until he was almost 5 and didn't use a stroller anymore (he had an old Chicco model that I really liked, but it is now the stroller that grandpa uses), so I figured it will be the same with my youngest, since he is smaller. If not, I'll have an excuse to buy another stroller ;-)    The color is not good nor bad, but it is different than what shows on the website. The website shows a dark orange color, but it really is bright red. To me, living in Ohio, turned out fine because now I have a \\"Scarlet and Grey\\" stroller for my little buckeye fan.
B001FB5BFW|4|I love this car seat! I have 2, one for my Trailblazer and one for my Camry. We have it rear-facing at the moment. I have 3 minor issues or it would be a 5 star rating. ~1~The LATCH system is hard to use and make it snug-so in the Camry we opted to use the seat belt, whereas in the Trailblazer we used the LATCH. ~2~In the Camry there is a center armrest that folds down; because the car seat is rear-facing the base of the car seat pushes down on it making the center arm rest fold down an inch or two-not touching my son at all-he can't grab to touch it in any way, it is just super annoying seeing it. ~3~To remove the infant headrest the shoulder straps come off the \\"splitter plate.\\" It didn't really make sense of what that was in the instructions. It took me a few minutes to figure it out. (ALSO, a LARGE towel is needed for the Trailblazer to make it level, and a medium sized one is needed for the Camry)<br /><br />I am sure with it being forward-facing I will rate it a 5 star.<br /><br />I bought this item from Miss Tracy's. I LOVED them. They are super speedy, kind, and generous. Got it for a GREAT price too!! I will definitely be purchasing from them again.
B00Q75D7VQ|5|My stepdaughter just had a baby and is nursing, she used these nursing pads and has had great success with them.  They are very lightweight and wash very well.  she said they have a great feel to them and hardly feels that she is using them.  great product, I'd love to purchase another set if my grandson nurses longer.
B00AYZFH18|5|Gave it to my mom bc she wanted something that wasn't too big to carry her pics in of her new grandchild.  She loved it
B006Z6E8AG|5|It is good for beginning of baby solid food when you need to mash most of vegetables. Easy to handle and wash.
B0002J5GDU|4|I'm writing this review because we thought we could use the couch for sleepovers, but when open it is nowhere near long enough to sleep on (even for my two year old who is petite for her age). I guess the flip open design is more for lounging on than anything else.   <br />We've had this couch for four months and it's held up well overall. My 4 and 2 year old kids like sitting side by side and looking at books on it.
B0000TYHCS|2|I bought these nipples for the platex Drop Ins bottles and they didnt work for us. We have to put oatmeal in my daughters bottles to help with her acid reflux and the formula/oatmeal mix did not come out of these at all. This was my last attempt in finding nipples that work for the bottles I have with the oatmeal so I just ended up cutting a larger hole with tiny scissors which I could have done with theh fast flow nipples I already had!
B0052QYLUM|5|Love this monitor! It is so easy to use and the picture quality is excellent. I wondered about the quality because of the price but it has been fantastic. It is easy to set up and the monitor has great range. We have used it at home and when traveling to see family so we have attached the camera to various places and taken the monitor throughout multiple homes with good reception. The video is excellent both day and night and I like that I can adjust the brightness on the monitor when I go to sleep. The monitor is full color and switches to night vision when the lights are off in the baby's room. I wish the battery would last longer without being charged but it does beep to tell me it's getting low. I plug it in at night when I go to bed and then use it remotely during nap time and in the evenings. I've never had any interference and I like that it is a private channel so I don't have to worry about security. It gives me peace at night that I can just look and watch my child move while sleeping instead of getting up multiple times at night to check. It also picks up loud noise like crying but doesn't register soft noises so you don't have background noise coming from the monitor. This is a great monitor for a reasonable price without having to sacrifice sound and video quality.
B005I19LOC|5|I love love love love this monitor!  We live on a farm and I love that I can go to chores while my little one sleeps and I can see and hear him the whole time!  The clip is molded into the monitor and over all this unit seems really sturdy.<br /><br />I can't think of anything I don't like about it.  :)<br /><br />It may not have all the bells and whistles some of the other monitors have, but if you're a parent who wants to be able to step outside for a minute and still keep an eye on your baby, this one will do a great job.
B007DUEILC|5|This stroller is perfect for my little boy! I was looking for a bassinet style stroller for my newborn son, and was considering having my mother bring one from Norway as I know that they are good quality there. The last one we had for my older son was good but the frame did not seem very sturdy (almost seemed like plastic) and the frame breaking was why we had to look for a new one now. This frame seems very sturdy and I was excited just putting the bassinet on it feeling like it would for sure hold together.<br /><br />The bassinet is nicely padded and the hood and cover is nice and thick. We live in N.D so the winters here get cold. Yesterday we were out walking in 25 degree weather (my son is currently 6 weeks and was dressed nice and warm) and when you stick your hand inside the hood of the stroller his cheeks (and the rest of him) were warm the whole 45 minute walk.<br /><br />I love the other attachments that come with the stroller as well. The color is bright but I love the lime green (and I got it for $50 less because of the color - WELL worth it).<br /><br />The only thing I wasn't super excited about was the rain cover. The opening in the cover is small and I would have liked more ventilation in it. Other than that the bug net is wonderful and the rain cover seems thick and sturdy.<br /><br />I can't wait to keep using this stroller through the seasons and in all sorts of weather (our 3 year old son is actually wishing for one just like it for Christmas;-)!
B00AESYP8Q|5|Simple and usable product. Suction cup works great. Good buy. Love it. Just LOVE IT :):) you'll love it too :)))))
B001CW7CVK|5|My granddaughter loves it, works great.  When she is put down for the night, it keeps her thinking about crying because she still wants to stay up.
B00E8UINPW|3|It's cute but for the price I really thought it was going to be bigger. I wish he sang his theme song too. I knew it didn't but I wish it did sOmething for this price.
B00LI5MT96|5|This product is absolutely gorgeous. It is much bigger than I anticipated. I love it!
B001LENCUE|4|Helps really good against babycramps. Easy to clean compared to the slim bottle.
B005NMP5R8|4|Bought this for my daughter as she likes to fall asleep in the back seat of my truck and her head was always bouncing around.  Works ok but does have a tendancy to slide down and be out of position.
B0030XN6JQ|5|I ordered this bassinet on june 3 3010 and received it on the 6 it  was really simple to put together me and my 4 year old step daughter had it to gether with in 10 mins the hardest thing to figure out was how to get the cover on that took about 15 min but that's only because I was Puting it on backwards once I got it together it was so cute I love it it reminds me of the one from my child hood . Now there are a few cons but none I did not fully expect    cons  a really thin mattress (but that us with most bassinets)  and the hood was a little difficult to get on but I had that problem with my step daughters bassinet      Pros  easy to asemble  really cute  bows are easy to but own   and it's. Really sterdy I know because my little 2 yearold neice climbed in and it was fine   now I have to warn it dose rock but I like that kind of like a cradle       Bottem line  if you want a simple cute bassinet with out a whole Lot of fancey things then this is the one for u
B00IOX9CYK|5|These are great muslin blankets! I love the colors and how soft they get after multiple washes. My daughter loves muslin to cuddle with and suck on. I can feel safe knowing that they are thin and breathable if she naps with one. Totally recommended these (I own A and A and these are a great cheaper alternative....not quite as good, but still worth buying.)
B0031AO1OW|5|Great bed for the price! It was quite easy to put together using an electric drill for the screws. I had my two year old climbing all over me when I was putting it together and still got it done in under an hour with no other help. As for the weight limit, I've laid in it with my 26lb daughter and felt/heard no stress to the bed.
B00LIX3AW8|3|It is not sturdy, but cute.
B000WIGEL4|4|We've used it for a couple nights now.  On its lowest setting, its a managable noise level.<br />Just background noise.  but i've read some reviews and descriptions that say its very quiet....its NOT!.<br /><br />I dont have any major complaints and i can deal with the sound, but take note.<br /><br />all in all...its seems good.  The size of the water holder is probably its best feature.
B0009ET49K|5|This brush has been great and after 2+ years it's still in great condition, whereas I know some of the other more sponge-like brushes tend to fall apart (from what other moms have told me). Now that we no longer have baby bottles we still used it for washing other things like narrow water bottles, things with little crevices, etc. I've had several moms go out and buy one of their own after using ours.
B00F2MQ258|5|This was one of the few things I bought for my daughter before she was born after the baby shower but before she was born.  I felt silly and frivolous but I'm so glad I went with my gut.  From about 2 weeks on this playmat has been my daughters favorite thing.  Two to five times a day she's on it happily staring at the toys or kicking the piano.  She's 7 weeks now and the novelty hasn't worn off, each week she likes it ore and more.  It's also been great for tummy time and it's easy to get cute picture her on it.  This was a great buy.
B004IYC0UC|5|I wish i thought of this! Perfect for baby to have something to hold, esp in the first months when they get startled & jump easily!
B000FI0HUU|5|loved this, i recommend to many of my friends! its safe to put in baby nose to take  boogies out!!
B004JRR3I2|5|I LOVE this lamb!!! My son received this for a baptism gift and loved it so much that I made sure to get it for my godson as well! The one I purchased the ribbon was cut shorter though that I wish I would've had time to exchange it before the baptism, but I didn't. So you couldnt see that it said Jesus loves me on it. But it still adorable
B000KN2P6E|3|This product will be great in the fall and spring when I want to block bugs and wind, but here it is 100 degrees and up in the summer and there is very little if any air circulation. The mesh is very thick and the baby cannot see through it very well either. I recommend going with a thin mesh from a local store and a ray shade if you live in a hot climate.
B002A9IZ0Q|3|This was supposed to be my son's bed until he moved out of our house. From birth to adulthood... Unless my son wants to sleep on a toddler bed forever, it can still be his bed. When my mother purchased this crib, the full size rails were available. Since my son wasn't even born yet, we decided to wait on purchasing them. Now I can't find them anywhere.
B000056JEI|4|it's one of the decorative in my baby's room that I like. it's easy to put in the wall yet it adds the variety of the room
B003I867US|1|The appeal of a carrier like this is clear: it's so easy and it's so cheap!  But you should be aware that--as cheap as it is--it's still not a good deal.  For parents, this carrier puts all the weight on the middle of your back.  This HURTS and just isn't practical for much more than a short time.  The bigger problem is that this isn't good for the baby.  Doesn't it just look uncomfortable for a baby to be dangling from its hip bones? Well that should clue you in to the fact that this isn't good for the baby's development.  What you want is a carrier where the baby seems to be sitting and is supported by a broader base than here.    So what's a parent to do?  Well, there are plenty of soft structured and mei tei style carriers that are just as easy but much healthier for both parents and kids--two of the most common and cheapest brands are Boba and Ergo.  They are pricier than the Infantino but worth it if you plan on using the carrier for more than the very occasional short trip.
B004L0AGLI|3|It's smaller and thinner than other brands. I suggest to use this for a small baby. Once your baby is bigger or rolls this product may be small.
B004RVGPUC|4|I've been using this all summer and it seems to make a difference in keeping my baby cool.  He was soaked in sweat every time the car was warm, so I decided to buy a fan to attach to his seat, but saw this and decided to give this seat liner a shot.  We've had some really hot, 100 degree + very humid days so I've really had a chance to test this out.  He's still a little sweaty on occasion but I don't see how that can be prevented 100% of the time.  He is cooler though and much less sweaty I'm sure than if he didn't have the liner.  The main thing I like is that the liner doesn't interfere with the straps on the car seat at all, which means it doesn't affect the safety of the seat.  Good product, will definitely buy the next size up!
B005UVR09S|5|This travel system was AMAZING !!! I Loved The Color & How Light The Car Seat Was And Stroller is Easy To Fold ! I Love It
B0062NJ4ZG|5|Great product.
B00MPRRMZC|5|My son love his pillow.  Is the right size for him.
B0007DHT3Q|5|My daughter is a little person and only 1 years old. I have been having a hard time trying to find something to fit her small body and this was the perfect item for her. Its very mobile even on the rug we have in the living room. I will continue to pass on this item to other people who want to find the perfect walker for a child.
B001H1DOZO|5|This is the only baby mattress I have ever purchased so I don't have anyting to compare it to. It fits perfectly in the crib, is firm (which was the only thing I was particular about) and standard crib sheets stay put even with a very active baby.  It does the job as expected.
B006SFUEF2|3|The sound is poor quality even at low volume. Also, it only plays one song on loop. I wish it would play different songs without me having to press a button. Had I known that I would not have bought this. The projector is entertaining for my baby and he also likes the ocean sound. Not completely pleased with this product, but I already threw away the packaging.
B002XNUBQK|2|Good idea for little, uncoordinated hands but the spoon is too deep.  My 1 year old has a tough time getting the food out of it.
B000KJBFC8|5|This is a must for toddlers on a long car ride.  We didn't use the side pockets at all b/c they're a little deep and it was difficult for my son to reach his toys.  However, the pockets were great for holding is water bottle.  The tray itself is great b/c it has ample room for your child to play on, plus the rim prevents toys from going every which way.  Lastly the belt helps keep the tray in place, especially when your toddler nods off in the middle of playing with his/her toys.<br /><br />It's a little pricey I admit, but if you're facing a long trip with your toddler it's definitely worth considering.  I also love the fact that the tray is flexible, so you can fold it in half for easier storage.
B0076AGNF8|5|Perfct! That's it. Thanks.
B00S5YGXX6|3|This looks BIG in the photos, but upon arrival it is small.
B00G5KKXVK|5|WONDERFUL!  A must have for your baby as he/she learns to self feed.  I LOVE that it's silicone so I have no hesitation putting it in the microwave or dishwasher!
B006OJIK44|3|Easy to open, difficult to shut.  Secure for top of steps, but easier to open than close.  There's a latch at the top and the bottom.  Top secures very easily when you close it, but the bottom doesn't line up so it's often a multi-step process to line it up and get it to lock completely.
B001ODAHF0|5|The item came in faster than expected, it was in good condition and a few minutes later it was ready to use, we purchased this item as an extra stroller and it is way lighter than our other chicco and much more portable. If you're looking to travel or just going places I would really recommend it. Note: The Key Fit30 car seat does not attach to this stroller.
B0096I8ZYA|5|this was my 3rd little miracle hug and snug baby blanket and it is wonderful!!<br />One was a baby gift, the second one was for our \\"new Bull Mastiff Puppy, who still carries it with her and Sleeps with it and the stuffed puppy, and recently I thought I better buy a \\"back up\\" this last one, purchased was pricey, but I had an Amazon gift card so it worked out great! I'm saving the last one for our pup,she would be lost without her precious stuffed puppy and blanket<br />The seller advertisement was exactly what we received, and very well packaged. These little blankets are not easy to fine anymore,so I am very happy I purchased another! Would recommend and buy from this seller anytime!!
B002G9UTW2|5|I bought this for my one year old once the weather started to turn cold (October) here in upstate NY. He loves to go for stroller rides, and I knew this would keep him nice and snuggly warm while we went for a walk or jog. When he was a baby, I bought the infant sized version, and loved it (no struggling with a jacket on an infant!), so I knew this wouldn't disappoint. And I was right. It fits easily into his stroller (regular or jogging), and can easily transition to his car seat if I wanted to use it there. We even went for a walk in the cool October rain and the parts that were not covered by his stroller canopy stayed nice and warm and dry - the rain rolled right off it. I anticipate using this all winter and even sledding. Toddlers are wiggly, so a jacket, hat and gloves are still needed. If your child falls asleep during a walk, you can tuck their arms and head inside.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it doesn't stay securely in one place in his stroller, I have to adjust it a little each time I use it to prevent the wheels from brushing the bag. I'm sure this has to do with the fact that I can't use the straps around the hood because of the shape of my stroller (the canopy of the stroller is connected to the seat and I can't thread the securing straps through). So the only thing keeping it in place is the velcro around the seatbelt. Other than that minor detail, I love it, and more importantly, he is cozy and warm as the cold weather draws nearer in upstate NY.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00064MULM|5|Great product.  My son loves sitting on the cushy seat and \\"reading\\" a book there whether he has to go or not.  :-)  The front pee-pee guard is perfect for boys.
B0035JL930|5|All of what I expected. Came on time and are excellent. I would consider buying more. 5 stars for feed back
B00292ASI6|5|I bought my mountain buggy urban (single) back in 2006 for my first child after extensive research online and through ready baby bargains book.  What I love about this stroller is how easy it is to handle.  I can push and manuver tight areas one handed.  My 3 year old son was able to push the stroller himself at 2 years of age thanks to the adjustable handle bar.  At 14 pounds, it still easy to pick up and put into the car.  It compacts down with just one release at the front of the stroller (which requires you to use both your index fingers).  With the rubber tires and shocks, my children never woke up while they were in it, even when I went off the paved road onto dirt or grass.  I also purchased the peg perego car seat adapter which is so easy to use.  My 12 week old daughter now mainly uses the stroller, but when my son wants in, I just remove the adapter quickly and he climbs in!  On of the best features is that you can lock the front wheel and make it into a jogging stroller.  This is the only stroller I have bought and have gotten the most use out of it.  You'll never need to buy mutiple strollers, just this one.  It's a great price at around $400 considering how many strollers are also now in the same price range.
B001PTGPXQ|5|The product was received as promised. In good shape and packaged well. I ordered from a VERY popular MAJOR store online and was unhappy until I came to Amazon.com
B000VK2RGE|5|This frog is one of the cutest stuffed animals I've seen in a while.  Granted, there are quite a few out there that are just darling, but Freddie ranks right up there among the top!  I'd order him again (for a gift) anytime.  The one I ordered is for my forthcoming grandson in October. I know he'll love it.  Freddie is a great size...not too small and not too big!  Just perfect!
B000069RAO|1|I went to target today to purchase this boppy. Apparently it has been recalled and they took all the other ones off the shelf. I don't know why it has been recalled yet but I wanted to warn the amazon buyers first. <br /> <br />
B001MVNPLM|3|Noted the other reviews, so I knew this pillow was going to be small.  It was even smaller than I expected.  However, I it is a really nice size to leave in my glider for additional back support, and fits well with my decor.
B004KKXNM8|5|My daughter received the doggie plate and bowl set for a gift.  They are so cute! (We also have the matching backpack and lunchbag).  They are heavy-duty, safe for microwave and dishwasher and my 16 month old giggles everytime she sees the doggie.  =)
B000056HMB|2|It melted my baby's bottle after less than a minute of warming!
B00HAZS5PK|5|Awesome
B000EGEX2G|5|I purchased this for my daughter and my new grandson and they love it great price on this item fat shipment and good solid quality. I would buy again.
B007NG5UEU|4|I just picked this up after my 3 year olds old monitor finally went bad.  I really love it.  It has great range, good sensitivity, very intuitive functioning. I haven't talked to him yet because I don't want him to know I can hear him.  I'm sure that'll happen soon enough. As a single dad I like the dual monitor setup since I can have one unit in the basement to hear him when I'm working and he's sleeping. I've had the monitor out past the front of the house about 300 feet (his room is in the back of this old brick townhouse) and the monitor stayed linked.  Once it does lose lock , you'll have to get a lot closer for it to re-establish communications.  THis really helps me out since now I can venture out into the yard and get some stuff done while he's sleeping.  I'll update as I use it more.  So far I really like it. Only four stars since I haven't had much time to experience it.
B0096PWCRO|5|It was an awesome mat. I would order again if I needed another one. Great quality, great price, great overall.
B00BLBLR1I|5|This pump was highly rated on www.babygearlab.com and on Amazon.  I have not used any other pump so I can't compare, but I have been very happy with it.  It is comfortable to use and effective at pumping breastmilk. It is also very quiet (I have pumped in the same room as a sleeping baby and not disturbed her; I was also able to watch television with my husband while pumping. This model does not have a battery for travel, but at the time of purchase, it was almost half the cost of the S1 which does. I had originally purchased the S1, but the unit I received didn't work, and the seller was completely out of stock, so I bought this instead and so far don't regret the downgrade.  Additionally, the pump really is lightweight (less than half the weight of the Medela PISA, I think) and while this is not a deal-breaker, it is nice to not haul around something the same weight as your baby.  The nightlight feature is surprisingly handy.  I like the back flow preventer feature as well - no need ever to clean the tubes.  I also like the styling - it doesn't scream &#34;medical device&#34;. I highly recommend the S2 if you don't need battery functionality.
B001FT2NZU|5|This window valance is exactly what I expected. There were no surprises with what was sent. It looks great in the room and matches the bedding perfectly. Definitely boy colors.
B000VY1WPC|4|My child liked this very much. He looks forward to using the 3 in 1. This gives him a sense of  independence.
B004A5BRR6|4|The middle velcro strap hits right, smack-dab in the middle of one of the vertical crib bars.  I found that minute detail a little annoying, but the strap is still long enough to go around the bar and stick; it just looks wonky.  But........ my darling is chewing on it lots, so it's definitely doing the job I got it to do.
B001KZH69C|5|Best mattress pad ever!
B00LP7AO9O|5|Soft and cosy. Easy the zip and no stress that the zip will poke the baby.
B004XV11D2|4|This is the best straw sippy cup that I have found. Let's best honest...there is NOT a perfect sippy cup out there that doesn't leak...that's just a fact!  But this one, by far, leaks the LEAST of all the straw cups I have purchased.  The handles can be removed, which is perfect for our little girl.  Very happy mommy and baby!
B00GSP5BVE|4|There were few flaws that I could find with this product outside of the fact that the velcro pieces should be located a bit farther down the side than they are.  Other than that the product works wonderfully.  My child is very tall but slender and it worked fairly perfectly.  I would definitely buy again if I needed to.
B007VGI4TU|3|Doesn't look as nice as it does in the picture
B008B3UYIG|5|I bought this as a surprise for my dad when I told him I was expecting, and I was expecting this little 3&#34; rattle, adorable and all, but something that even infants could hold on to, and to my surprise, when I got it, I couldn't even close my hand around it! It's perfect for the little one to hang on to and won't accidentally eat it or anything, and it's so dang adorable! Total size, it's about 1.25&#34; in diameter, and is about 5&#34; high.
B005G324R8|5|i love these blankets, my son is 3 and they are still a great size!
B000PIZVIS|5|I say must have because life has been saved many times by this wonderful weather guard.  It helps with wind as well as the rain/sprinkles.  So there is no excuse to not get outside and go walking/jogging!  I hate that it's bright yellow but that was the only option for color.
B004OR1DTC|5|We started out with a traditional bottle drying rack, but I didn't really like it. There never seemed to be places to put any of the bottle accessories, just the bottles. We switched to the Boon Lawn a few months in and don't regret it a bit. I love that you can put any shape item anywhere on it, even non-bottle related things. I now use it for toddler sippy cups and dishes as well as knives and other miscellaneous. It has become a permanent fixture on my counter top. Worth the money.
B007NG5UF4|3|After nearly 6 years, our Sony Baby Call monitor had finally taken one too many falls, so we needed a new monitor. This one had such good reviews, we decided to give it a try over a new Sony Baby Call. While is has a good range, it is not nearly loud enough or sensitive enough. I can hear my baby breathing over the Baby Call, but not over this V-Tech. We can place the Baby Call in the kitchen and hear it anywhere on the first floor, but the V-Tech needs to be kept close by to be audible.
B003MI1NWG|2|I am not happy with the quality of most of the items in this set. The colors are very dull almost faded. The sheet are not soft at all and all items have an excessive amount of threads around the seams that need to be cut. This the worst product I have purchased through Amazon, If you want quantity, and you do not mind that it low quality go ahead and purchase. I am returning this set, but I do not get the shipping cost ($23.50) refunded and I must ship it back at my own expense, I really regret ordering from this company, I will never do so again. This purchase was a big loss for me. Also ordered the lamp shade (thin and badly made) and the mobile (okay quality) which I will also return.
B004I2JU02|5|Very usefull, specially the thicker part helps my baby to keep his neck dry as well as his cloth. After eating he used to have al his shirts wet, this is not hapening with the tommee tippee
B008KCR7U6|5|Hopefully it is just me, but the shipping on this is absolutely horrible! I ordered this on Feb. 8th... it was estimated to arrive between Feb. 13th & 15th... it remained in the &#34;Not yet shipped&#34; order status that entire time! Then the arrival date changed to Feb. 19th... Well here it is the 17th and it is still (just as it has been for the last 2 days) &#34;Preparing for Shipment&#34;! It is not going to arrive by the arrival date AGAIN!!! I ordered a ton of baby stuff from here. It all got here on time, except for this car seat that I am still waiting for! If I'm gonna pay over $100 dollars on a product, and especially after spending my hard-earned $600 for everything total, then amazon needs to pick up the damn pace! Waiting over 10 days is pathetic! It gets ZERO STARS for shipping...<br /><br />I have however seen what a great car seat Britax B-Safe can be! I have a cousin who owns one, and a close friend who owns one. Both love the seat, and I was impressed by it too! Which is one of the reasons I bought one for this baby I am currently pregnant with. The other reason I bought this care seat is because it has just as high ratings as the Chicco Keyfit, but it is cheaper & more affordable than the Chicco Keyfit! Saving money & still getting a great dependable product is always nice! So the seat itself gets 5 stars for being a wonderful car seat for a good price!
B002ECZUNE|5|When I was on maternity leave with our daughter, I nursed her the majority of the time. When it was time to take her to daycare, she had a difficult time with nipple confusion so we tried this bottle since we had received a free one in the mail. Its the only bottle she drink from because of the wide nipple. The flow is also great and similar to a nursing mother which lessens her confusion also.
B003YVTSMS|5|Loved it!  Washed well and so nice and soft for my little girl.  Used it for two years - and then gave it to my niece for her little girl!
B004I8VD8S|5|good
B0013DW4XO|5|We got this as a gift and it has become my sons best friend.  Every nap time and every bedtime he reaches for it as soon as we set him in the crib.  Absolutely love this snuggly.  We recently forgot it at a hotel across the country and we played phone tag for days with the hotel trying to track it down and get it sent back.  Luckily they found him!  Highly recommend! Don't know what my one year old would have done without him.
B00NZ4NCZI|4|I like they are lined, and the colors are great. There were a few small loose threads, but overall good quality for the price.
B0019QCH3C|5|Soft and effective brush. My baby likes having her hair brushed.
B005175KMU|4|Cute design for the money. Not hard to assemble but a little rickety. Good item for the money spent and true to image online.
B005NX677E|4|i never did get to use this as my grandson started walking before delivered....lol...oh well for the money I am keeping for the next one....
B00KBGTRAC|5|Easy to set up and put away and stores nicely
B001IACJQ4|5|My daughter just had a baby in March and it was great to see her bond with her son snuggling and rocking in this chair.
B00A67C5V4|5|I am very happy with the safety and quality of this car seat. I've used it for about a year and looks brand new with no problems. I'd buy it again!
B003LQU0GO|2|I thought that this was a good, space-saving and inexpensive alternative to jumperoos.  The problem with it is that because the bouncing tray doesn't provide any sort of stationary support, my son acts as if he feels unsafe in it.  It will only bounce if he puts his legs straight down in the center of the triangle (which doesn't happen often, after 2 months of daily use).  If he puts his feet down near the edge, the tray just tips and his feet slide off, so he mostly just sits in it.  I understand that the tray is really not supposed to give stationary support, but it didn't occur to me that he'd feel like he was falling when he tried to stand up or bounce in it.  In a jumperoo, they have the floor to push off of, so there's the stationary support they need. With this, it's just tipping that might eventually lead to bouncing, if you're lucky.  I feel like I wasted $40 on this, when I could have bought a nice barely-used jumperoo of just about any type from a resale shop or Craigslist for the same price, or the [[ASIN:B002OOWADU Fisher-Price SpaceSaver Bounce 'n Spin Froggy]] if space were really an issue.
B000BTNLBK|5|I would not buy this to use in warm weather or if you generally keep your house on the warmer side.The SleepSack itself is great and easy to use.
B00N5YCJ70|5|This is a very cute cover, the background is a soft pale pink not white. It fits my pillow perfectly, even after a wash. It dries really fast, so don't over dry. I like it a lot, I would definitely buy this again in the same pattern or another. I have to admit, I'm not big on the owl trend, but this is super cute.
B003I868CU|5|This is simply amazing but too bad that i just discovered it after my daughter turned 16 months. It totally eliminates the need of using a food processor and gives you the freedom of making just a couple of servings in one go. After a certain point of time, i started to use a fork to roughly mash up the steamed fruits and veggies for my daughter and noticed that the fork had started to leave marks on my corelle plates ( yes, the same chip resistant - virtually unbreakable corelle plates!). I didnt want to go the food processor route again and thankfully i discovered this. Also, the slotted surface makes it much easier to totally mash up certain fuits like blurberries which are prone to leave almost all skin behind when mashed up using a fork alone. This way i can give blueberries to my daughter along with other fruits and veggies which have soft skin and virtually impossible to remove ( green peas , blueberries etc). I absolutely love this and its a must have for all parents with small kids.
B001OC5UNK|5|I bought this gate to keep my yorkie out of the living room, while she is being potty trained.  The only problem is, she was too small and walked right thru the rungs until she was about 7 months old.  It is a wonderful product and I love the swinging door.  Much nicer that having to step over a smaller gate!
B007CTPWXW|5|Got this to use on a Baby Jogger City Mini stroller. Love that it has two cup holders. It stays in place one you put it on. The magnetic closure on the middle compartment is great too.
B005UV0UEA|5|We have two of these, and they are great for anything related to a kid.  We have one downstairs to put our newborn in when we are down there so it acts like a daytime crib.  When kids get older it is easy to lower it to make it like a mini playpen.  We have one setup as a timeout station for one of our children and it is quite effective in that role as well.  Add all of that to the fact that you can easily and quickly pack it up and have it move with you and you have a great Pack n' Play!
B0055NCF96|5|The blanket is very soft and thick. It is Exactly what I wanted but the quality exceeded my expectations. It is Perfect for cold weather.
B001OC5UNA|3|If you are looking for a gate that will get you through a year's worth of use, this is the gate for you. Not as sturdy as other gates that we have tried, but it does the job. The lock mechanism feels like it could break if handled too roughly, so we have been careful with it. If our dog were to jump on it, I feel it would probably not be strong enough to hold him. For the low price, so far, it has worked out fine.
B00AKKDSNG|5|Very good quality, very easy to assemble. We compared a lot of choices on Amazon and were hesitant to go with this one because a few reviews said the pad wasn't very thick. We're glad we did and the pad seems to be comfortable.
B0039G9MY2|4|Nice cloth bag.  Machine washable and doesn't seem to stain.  Easy to put the liner in the diaper pail.  It would be nice if it could be washed with the cloth diapers, but a Hot wash would likely compromise the material.
B00H9W24Q0|5|We have a puppy one.. which we like a bit more because the legs of this one gets in the way a bit more...
B000MPP922|4|This is a great invention. Easy to carry, plush enough to cushion the baby somewhat. Brightly colored with toys to play with and a pouch to hold bottles, soothers, etc. Can't go wrong for the price!
B004AHMCW8|4|I threw my cousin an owl-themed baby shower, and this was such a cute addition to her gifts. Once baby arrived, she loved the toys.
B003DZ13E6|4|good chair
B0000DEW91|5|We searched everywhere for a baby gate that would fit our odd width stairs and this one was the perfect fit. Went up pretty quickly and is really easy to open and close even while carrying a toddler. Does wobble a bit when our child shakes it, but no worries about it coming down.
B000WPVCQE|4|Works well for a pumping mom (I'm writing this under my husband's profile).  Wish I could order just the nipples, though, as I already have many bottles.
B00II0X8YE|2|While, yes, its a pretty print, the sheets themselves are very thin and scratchy. Not worth the money I paid for them at all. They feel super cheap. I can only hope they get softer with time and washing.<br /> As is, I wouldn't lay by newborn on these rough sheets.<br /> I also don't think they will hold up long either, as they don't look very well made at all.
B001CIY2D0|4|This bowl has visual interest, which keeps my toddler engaged and not dumping food out. It's wide enough for little fingers to fish out food without making a huge mess.
B0036SGC6O|5|Exactly what I was looking for to be able to  securely lock my stroller!
B003NSBJZG|2|I ordered this 18-cube ice mat, selected over the 9-cube item because it was only 25 cents more expensive.  Based on the description, i expected to receive 2 of the 9-cube sheets.  I received the product and discovered only a single 9-cube mat.  The factory label lists it as 18 cube, so I'm not certain what happened.  Not going to return it, since it's only a 25 cent difference, but I was disappointed none the less.
B000G7TIZA|5|My baby is so comfy on this changing pad - she enjoys to just lay there and kick around.  I love that the sides are elevated - no way she is rolling off, at least now when she is little.  Would highly recommend this.
B00BRHSCLO|5|Great set for the money and makes brushing so much fun, my daughter looks forward to it. Easy to keep clean and organized.
B001708AS6|5|I hung them with a set of white sheers... ADORABLE in my daughter's room! I will be using these for many years to come, as they will coordinate with so many different designs/themes/etc.  I also bought the matching crib skirt... a bit pricey, but worth it!
B0051GJ52C|1|I was very excited to buy this dresser.  It looks great in the picture but I am very disappointed in it.  It was absolutely ridiculous to put together.  You really have to watch out for the smallest details in the pictures. Once it was together, I found out that it is extremely wobbly. I mean I rest my hand on the top and move my hand and the dresser sways from side to side.  The drawers do not line up.  Some look like they are sagging and others practically overlap so you have to hold one drawer to push the other one in all the way. It does not look good or like the picture. The only reason we are not returning it is because we dread having to take it apart when there are so many pieces and tons of hardware and our box is already gone. We will probably deal with it for a year or two but we will not go cheap again on dressers.  We wish we would have paid more and received a better product.
B00GCYTNYM|5|Cute
B00OVC01VG|5|We are using these for our 2 year old on both sides of a twin bed and there is plenty of room for her to sleep, and even room for us to lay with her to read stories. The product stays in place and pops right back into shape after adult lying on it. Perfect to keep toddler from falling out of bed! Our sheets&mattress cover fit up to 15\\" pockets and are a little stretched, but fit fine.
B009VYX8E6|5|I have owned this for about 7 months and have used it many times for many reasons. I purchased this to travel to a friends house. I checked a bag at the airport with this inside it. Yes, it did take up about 60% of a large checkable suitcase however, that was still enough room for my things ( and my daughters).<br /><br />Set up time: here's the thing y'all...majority of uses happen on vacation. Start by planning ahead. Practice once at home and let the little one check it out. First attempt took me 16 minutes ( yes I timed it because of the other reviews). 16 minutes included my daughter hanging on me and running away with parts. Once arriving at your destination be smart and set this up before a nap or bedtime is needed. Another tip, grab a beer or wine before you start, this is vacation after all. Second time I assembled this it took 9 minutes, no instructions needed, 1/4 of my beer, and I had fit my daughters blanky inside the carry case. 7 months later it takes me 5-10 minutes for set up. If this is too much for you go ahead and break your back and pay up to check a full size pack and play.<br /><br />Break down time: again plan ahead. This takes the same amount of time to break down and set up. The two joints of the side rails take the most time.  Bring a key with you to push the button or lean it against the corner of a dresser while pulling apart. Be sure to remove the feet when rolling it all together so it fits easily in the bag ( which it does). After squish/rolling the air out of the pad remeber to close the valve so air doesn't come back in.<br /><br />Flaws: joints in side rails are too stiff to push with finger. Tabs on corner of mattress are stupid tricky (I don't even hook them anymore).<br /><br />Pros: light weight. Fits in checkable suitcase. Can be carried on. Shoulder strap and bag are great. Light weight. Slim size can even fit in some closets which my daughter likes.<br /><br />My daughter is 19.5 months old and 95th percentile for height. She has pleanty of room and sleeps great in here. She has never tipped it over. If this is going on a tile floor I do put a towel under it. On carpet it's fine ( seems hard but she sleeps great).  If you travel with a baby and are decent at assembling things this is for you! If u want a mini mericle 1 lb pop up crib please invent one and I will be the first to purchase haha.
B00BGY978A|5|I waited a while to write this review. This is the only stroller I had so far for my son and I don't think I will need another one. We had it for 14 months and used it since birth. It withstanded two overseas flights, second winter in NYC, worlds worst brick laid roads in Northern Europe and many miles in multiple terrains. This stroller has no signs of heavy use except for a small tear on a storage pocket.( totally my fault). Wheals work great, fabric is easely cleaned, it fits in a trunk of our small car and my son seams pretty happy in it. But THE BEST thing about it is it's weight! I have to carry the stroller and my son to the third floor up to my apartment every time we go outside. I am so glad i did a research and picked the most lightweight reclinable stroller I could find, it gives me freedom of leaving the house with a toddler without asking for help or waiting for my husband to get home. Another thing, it folds and can be stored away in a closet. If you live in a NYC apartment and don't have additional storage, just imagine having a stroller with dirty wheels in your hallway with a baby who crawls and picks all the dirt from the floor.  As for the color, it is awesome! You will not regret choosing it.
B00YV3D2RU|5|These bibs are not only ADORABLE, but they are super soft. They also wash up really nice and look great as part of any outfit. A must have for any baby!!!
B007HZBOFG|5|Durable with perfect portion compartments for balanced meals. They don't stain, which is nice if like me, your little one is a spaghetti aficionado- as well as Greek yogurt + cherry/strawberry partial. Highly reccommend these!
B001PQAPOO|3|This served it's purpose for a temporary fix, but the whole thing is kind of flimsy and I would not recommend it to anyone.
B00DQL6CIE|4|I really like this. Works well. Better than buying on the go packs of huggies wipes everytime I run out. Just as expected :)
B00G34TIDW|5|Great deal.  I'll take a damaged box any day if I can save money on a brand new quality car seat!
B00XO8H5CQ|5|I love this product for my teething baby. I love that it stays on her hand so I'm not having to run to the sink to wash it off like I did with other teethers. The material also absorbs some of her drool so she's not drenched. It also has some crunchy material that keeps her busy. I always get asked about her mitt :)
B004C053BA|5|This is the only bottle my baby will take. She is EBF. We've tried other types and she doesn't like any. I think the let down effect is what makes it so wonderful. She can control the flow. And the nipple feels more realistic compared to other brands.<br /><br />Only (minor) issue is that this bottle is too wide to fit in our bottle warmer but we just warm milk up in our medela bottles and then pour into the comotomo.
B00ATRCQW4|5|As expected, love it
B003EYV26U|5|I just got this in the mail yesterday, but it seems like a great bib. It is very similar to my favorite bib, but has a button closer which I actually like better. The other one is velcro and it wears out really fast. So yeah, I would suggest this bib :)
B00DJPGL3S|3|It's an ok buy volume is too low and it doesn't spin as fast as I would like.
B00GCYTNYM|5|Works great!
B000I0YYYU|5|I LOVE this product.  I do not have the luxury of a dishwasher... my teeny tiny dishrack would easily overflow with bottles, nipples and all the parts that came with it. Not to mention, baby's bottles would normally get shoved to the bottom from all the other dishes that belong there.  With this doo dad- no more worries. All bottles and parts dry so very quickly, not to mention it tucks away nicely in the corner, leaving much needed space in the dishrack. It's pretty stylish, too. I got one for Grandma's house. It is very clear where baby bottles go- even the men can wash them and put them away properly... in their own special place!  I've also decided not to use the brush, since there is no replacement piece for just that.  Then again, my bottle brush already had a place of it's own! A definitely MUST HAVE for all mommies- a great shower gift that will be greatly appreciated when put to use.
B002Q0YA44|5|I bought this for my 13 month old boy.  Its the only potty I have, but I did shop a lot for this type of product, and I am very satisfied with the construction and durability of the product.   It is easy for a child to remove the inner potty, but I think that is okay because we are teaching our son to flush.  We have not had a problem with needing a different style of splash guard - this one works well.  I do think that it is small... our son is tall for his age and I wonder if he will be comfortable on it at age 2.  It is a good beginning potty, and I think its a good price, too.
B000056HKJ|2|This chair is excellent in many ways.  Yes, it takes up less space, yes, it is easy to clean, but when your child is at the age where you need to feed him/her more then just a bottle, you really do need a portable highchair, for lack of better terms.  Because this chair does NOT fold up....it is almost useless to me at this point in time.  I cannot lug it around w/ a baby in one hand and a diaper bag in the other!
B0091E31KM|3|Not the best sounds..a little fake sounding. But for the price this has served us well to help baby sleep through the night. We just use the white noise feature and it works just fine for us. Easy to travel with too.
B002XFE894|5|Very good product
B002VPCNVQ|5|My boyfriend really wanted a crib with a side changer and drawer underneath.  We searched around all the usual places and decided on this crib from Amazon.  The value for the price is fantastic.  It looks great in the nursery; but it IS a long crib, due to the changing table.  My boyfriend did say that the assembly was a headache.  The only drawback (for me) is that the one side of the crib that is attached to the changer and storage cabinet could be made with a sturdier panel.  However, after comparing prices, I am pleased with our purchase.  Now we just need to wait for our little girl to get here to start using it!
B0046RDG8Q|5|This really is a cute chair and it seems to be very sturdy!  The kids love it--guess there has to be yellow on it for MM but sucks that it is so light and stains easily.  Just treat it before you hand it over.
B00138LGOC|5|I purchased this as a gift and will probably have to get one for my own baby due in a few months.<br /><br />The pages are crinkly and the tails add interest. It also comes with a Velcro loop to hang from a bag or stroller making it a nice little accessory to keep little ones entertained.<br /><br />While this is a book, I wouldn't say its bedtime story appropriate. It's more like a toy. I can see little ones flipping through it on their own or for mom or dad to read and flip through for tummy time or other play time.<br /><br />It seems pricey, but as with most Jellycat products it's nice quality and seems worth it.
B0032G9E0G|5|So stylish! Recommended
B0016KYMMU|5|My son is 21 months and loves this potty. He likes sitting on the toilet instead of a separate potty on the floor. The poop and pee go directly in the toilet. So, there's none of the floor potty cleanup involved. We have one for the house and one for on-the-go.
B0002OT00U|5|Sad I didn't find these 3 years ago!
B00BZGRKG0|4|Cute for the price. My son is mesmerized by the stars. The touch sensor sometimes gives you hiccups. You need to just hit it at the right spot to get the music and lights to turn on. So far so good. Buy it when it goes up on amazon deals.
B00DB3Q0V6|5|It was a gift for grandchild.  His mom says she really likes it.  Everything fits really well.  Likes everything about it.  Grandson picked it out.  He loves it also.
B008BGNT3A|5|I originally was buying this for my grandson when he comes to my house, but ended up sending it to my daughter for her to use.  My grandson loves it and so do my daughter & I.  The tray is oversized so you can have several toys on it....because no matter what some end up on the floor.  Also I like that it doesn't go around in circles...he has to move it forward or backwards, which he has already figured out.  Very well made and sturdy.  I am now a JOOVY fan.
B006ZVV0NO|5|This comes with two shield that cover most of your side windows. It gives a really good tint that can be adjusted and removed as needed. The stickiness might go away over time of pulling it off several times but only time can tell. I do already have some tiny on my window and it did not mess up the tiny the one time I pull it off to adjust it. It's cheaper than getting tiny or replacing your current tint for stronger tiny.
B004BZ3AY8|5|I love this stroller. I cannot say it enough!! I got the Moodd hoping that all the new release reviews (from other sites) were right in saying it was the Buzz plus more... but it is not!! The Buzz has many better features that were just not improvements with the moodd:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to push, it just glides and maneuvers with a finger!<br />Looks great!<br />Good hood (could be bigger, but it is adequate)<br />Great seat<br />Goes truly flat!!<br />Easy breakdown and setup (can't be beat and is worth its weight in gold (price))<br />The straps are really soft and comfortable, my daughter loves getting in the stroller and refuses to get out! (she thinks it is her princessmobile)<br /><br />Cons:<br />A bit on the heavy side, but I find it worth it for a stroller that pushes like this!<br />No drink storage and the under stroller storage is a bit pitiful (looking to get the joovy parent organizer for it)<br /><br />Advantages over the Moodd: Can carry 50lb child, better hood, better and more comfortable seat, lies flat, the seat does not pitch forward, I like this bar better than the Moodd TBar, easier to unfold-one bar to move whereas the Moodd has 2 levers then a bar, no shiny plastic to get beat up and scratched<br /><br />Mood advantages over the Buzz: Different colors (not my priority), easier to recline the seat with one hand instead of 2 on the buzz, looks trendier.<br /><br />Overall the Buzz for us was a better option at a bit of a better price, although we were willing to pay for the Moodd, but it was not right for us for the above reasons (mainly the lack of a truly lie flat position and the weight limit..
B00101TXPG|4|First of all, ONE THOUSAND THANKS to the person who mentioned the tiny pieces of plastic over the metal!  My son is 10 weeks old, and we have spent that entire time frustrated over the fact we had to keep the parent unit plugged in.  After reading that review, the thing works great! I couldn't believe that a product rated so highly by parents and Consumer Reports for ease of use and range would be tethered to the wall outlet!  You must be sure to remove from each slot for the battery a very small piece of opaque plastic covering the electrode.    PROS:  I also agree that the design is slim and chic. Very lightweight. Very discreet.    I have read reviews that the lights on the power buttons on each unit are too bright.  But I disagree. I must not be that sensitive.  I don't have to hide the unit in my son's room, nor do i have to cover the one next to my bed. I was worried about it, as I am a light sleeper, but a piece of electrical tape over the button is adequate to diminish the light, if it winds up being a problem.    The sound is clear with good volume control. I sleep with a sound machine next to my bed (my baby's shuts off after 20 min), and I can clearly hear him over that.     I also like that the fact that if the baby unit fails or the power goes out, the parent unit immediately makes a horrendous beep.      CONS:  I don't like that there is no battery backup for the baby unit.  Finally, I think that the ease of use could be better (hence 4 stars). I don't like press and hold---when he starts fussing I like to get up and shut the thing off so my husband isn't too disturbed.  By the time I hold  for 5 sec, the baby is much more upset and harder to calm. Plus that battery thing was unnecessarily obscure.    Overall, though, i am very satisfied and would purchase again.
B004GCJMMU|2|Just... Lackluster. I found a way to make it work but it doesn't deter my child much.
B000A88KCC|1|we have the freestyle breast pump, and it comes with the 24mm breastshield. we tried-out the 27mm breast shield but the tunnel length (distance to the pump-head) is much longer than the 24mm breastshield, so the milk pools in the tunnel!!<br />i think design doesn't work well for us, so i called the canadian medela customer service and they said too bad, that's the way it is. they should have tried some gesture to satisfy me as the customer over a 9$ product (we've spent hundreds of dollars on medela products) but i guess they don't really care about \\"customer service\\".
B007R56YEC|5|I purchased this for my 10 month son, and he loves it. He watches the wave motions that project onto the walls and ceiling, and it calms him down. There's 2 different types of sounds this toy makes, waves crashing and then a lullaby with waves crashing and seagulls in the background. The sounds aren't annoying and you can adjust the volume. You can also adjust the brightness of the waves. I also love this turtle. I sometimes take it to my room when I'm having trouble sleeping. Such a great purchase. I do wish like previous reviewers said that it played longer before the automatic shut off. Also, I purchased mine for 28 bucks from Zulily, so you may want to shop around and save some money.
B00J0YSEWI|4|Very nice and smooth ride and easy to fold up.
B000RLO2Y2|4|I've used other latches and this one is my favorite. Some other latches we've used are made of a softer plastic and they have actually torn or broken after a couple weeks of heavy use.  I used these hard plastic gerber latches with my first daughter and they have lasted for 16 years.  I'm still using them with our one year old. I also like that it is a one piece latch and you only have to position one piece instead of two when installing. A note of caution, make sure the screws are tight when you install it. If you don't tighten the screws firmly, the latch will slip down with use and the door/drawer will open.  Properly installed, I've found they work well. So far, none of my kids have been able to figure out how to operate it. If your little one is good at figuring out child latches, I would suggest the magnetic latches from Safety First. Those are less convenient for parents but very safe and no pinched fingers.
B000056C86|5|Buy this Pack N Play!!  All pros and no cons on this.  It was so simple to assemble, it took only about 3 minutes from box to being put up, and some of that time was to remove the tags. Only three parts, just the frame, the folding padded floor, and the carrying bag.  It is roomy, has plenty of padding, and has 9 legs for a strong and even base.  It is great for sleeping away from home, and great for playtime, because there is enough room for baby to crawl around and sptill have plenty of room for toys in with him.  You can purchase sheets for sleeping, but you won't need extra padding or an extra mattress, it's soft enough. It's easily moved from room to room.<br /><br />I put a different pack N play together a few months ago from the same company and it was a nightmare!  In my opinion, this is the best on the market.
B0042RU2UA|5|This is a great toy for little ones.  It has lots of different textures, sounds and activities to keep your baby engaged
B000BU4CHQ|4|As a mother with twins, this stoller is a great option as the kids get out of the infant stage.  It folds up smaller than most double strollers and is light weight and fairly easy to control.  Drawbacks:  no real storage for diaper bag or purse and the seat belts are difficult to adjust quickly.
B00U7LMO8I|2|Didn't fit well at all. Needs better sizing.
B003VNKLHA|5|I use this &#34;baby gate&#34; to keep my dogs from escaping and it works great. Easy to assemble. No holes required. Love it
B004044LD4|3|Item arrived in a timely fashion and it fit our crib perfectly!!! Happy that it has the water-proof cover on it.
B00E19T2EQ|5|These sheets are so soft and well made. They are the only ones that I use. Great for babies; gentle on their skin.
B000MF6V1K|5|I bought this for my 23 month old.  She loves to drink Capri Sun drinks and squeezes them every time.  My problem is now solved.  I haven't tried it with box drinks yet, but think it will do fine as long as they are not the smaller ones.  My child can now drink a bag drink without squirting it everywhere.  The Capri Sun drinks fit very well into the bag.  They aren't too lose or too tight!  It's a perfect fit.  I wish you could choose a color.  I got the green one...it's just not a pretty color to me!
B000I2MRLK|5|My daughter was super excited by this toy! She was 4 months when I gave it to her and the first time she saw it she laughed out loud! There are many different colours and textures for her to explore and one of the patches on the wing makes squeaky noise when pressed. She also loves the crinkly material on the wings and the black and white shapes on the back of the wings. She can grasp it with both hands and likes sucking on his beak and wings. Great stimulatory toy!
B00KZTY8N6|5|Bibs are a must have when baby starts drooling, and these are so adorable!
B009ZWUQ94|2|Great idea but execution with a toddler... Not so much.  She just turns it upside down, pushes on it, and dumps her drink everywhere.
B00H8MSK1Y|3|Great and safe but they seem very uncomfortable because their chins almost touch their chests. Plus they're HUGE!
B000HCQXUW|5|I have tried a lot of hats.  My 2 year old daughter hates wearing them.  I was doubtful this one would be different.  But she loved the pink color the moment I showed it to her.  I think maybe the material makes it more comfortable on her head too, so she is less apt to take it off.  And it's so great that it has sun protection!
B004MO35W0|3|This is not the exact version of the car seat that we have, but it is similar enough. We went with BabyTrend when shopping for a car seat because of the cool triangular handle.  We thought it would prove more comfortable to grip with add options.  It hasn't proven to be all that great.  The car seat itself is on the heavier side of infant car seats.  The handle is really difficult to change the position of.  It often takes several tries to get the red buttons on the sides to both be pushed in enough to actually move the handle.  When out baby was small enough, we would just slip him out without moving the bar, but as he got older it became necessary to always move the bar.  It's frustrating when you want to get your baby out (especially when he's crying) and you have to spend so long trying to get the handle to move out of the way!  Anyone who has tried our car seat has difficulty with the bar (grandparents, daycare, friends, etc).<br /><br />On the positive side, it does fit nicely into our Prius and Corolla.  Also, the straps are easily adjustable and are easy to use.  The material also cleans fairly well.
B00F7PXANW|1|These are not fun to clean or for the kids to use. I wish I knew someone I could give them to so I can avoid throwing them out...THe Squoosh brand is much better!
B007XZI0IO|5|Super soft - my daughters favorite comfort toy.
B00MNLG00S|3|It arrives on time, well packed. It doesn't cover well- too short in front and at the sides when I'm not even holding my baby yet, and I'm a 5'3&#34; size 10-12. It would have worked very well if it's longer and the sides are sewn together.
B00BYKV1VM|5|I ordered this wrap recently and received it really quick. The craftsmanship and attention to detail are one of the best I have seen. A lot of love was poured into this wrap for sure. The best part as well? It really works! My toddler used to love getting out of her car seat straps (just like her mama did at that age) and now she can't and it keeps her safe while driving any length of time in the car. Thanks so much!
B00EGBFQMQ|3|The cards were bigger than I expected.
B0043C5XYY|3|The idea of these turned out to be better than in actuality.  I found that I wished the overall size was larger so that they would lay flatter.  Also, this is not a product issue, but a personal preference...they are quite thin. So if you need any padding to help reduce nipple protrusion, these are not thick enough.
B00117GEO2|5|&#34;used&#34; and perfect<br />I did not know there were angel dear pillows<br />had the small items AND the blanket so of course &#34;needed &#34;this<br />like the other angel dear items this is carried throughout the house!
B003JJX2IG|5|I love these potty covers. I was very hesitant for my daughter to start potty training for my germophobia and fear of public restrooms, but upon findin these, I am hooked. I take them everywhere with us and I even use them myself. It has so much more coverage than the seat covers most public restrooms offer and the extra coverage on the side and in front is a plus. It allows my now fully trained daughter to use the bathroom and I don't hold it as often as I used to. LoL!
B00B0ZMOJ4|5|My son really loves it! It's very convenient to take it with us wherever we go. You can easily attach it to any toybar or (car seat) handle!!!:)
B00CJZ0JD2|3|is thinner than I thought
B004XJCKHU|5|love this style, used one back in the day with my kids, lots of new features on this one, was a gift
B000J41NS0|1|I was very excited to use this but was very disappointed. It did not stay on the tub faucet for ten seconds.  We have the type of faucet that you cannot adjust the water pressure, and it was way too much for this hose and sent water up through the shower head then popped off.  It might be more useful if you are attaching it to a low-pressure faucet like a bathroom sink.
B002J73S9M|5|This bib is fantatic!  It's pocket sticks out away from the big to catch everything baby drops, the neck has 2 different snap settings for different sized necks, and the pocket also snaps open for easy flat washing.  It is a heavy rubbery feel plastic and just feels like really great quality.  Because it was a little more expensive than the other pocket bibs I ordered I decided to just try one of these, but once I got it, I wished I had just gotten more of this type, even if it would have meant buying a little smaller number of them.  It is just really the best.
B00EVLIHWM|4|My Granddaughter really can get around in this...she loves it.
B00KDJ4YXM|5|I bought this as a gift for my son and daughter inlaw.  They are thrilled with it.  It has a very clear screen and many extras that they were not expecting.  It is everything and more than they expected from a baby monitor.
B009SP94GE|5|This play pen is amazing! My great nephew loves it! He plays in it for hours, he has even fallen asleep!
B0045I6IA4|1|I ordered these in hope that they would help my newborn soothe themselves, since I heard it was so highly rated. However, I beg to differ. When I introduced him to the soothie, my newborn had it in his mouth for maybe one second and it would keep flying out of his mouth. Horrible pacifiers! They do not stay in the newborn's mouth! Definitely would not recommend anyone getting this especially if you wish to calm your wailing baby.
B0000CED84|1|Fabulous idea, but not very good.  I bought this gate to put across my driveway to keep balls from rolling into the road.  The mesh material isn't strong enough to stop the balls.  When there is a breeze the mesh blows and small balls roll right underneath, and larger balls keep rolling right thru it if they're going fast enough.  It might be better if the spring mechanism was stronger to keep the gate stretched tighter.  Also, you need two people to retract it in order to keep the mesh straight and not bunch up on itself.   <br /> <br />If all you want is to give your kids a visual so they stay away from the street it's OK.  BOTTOM LINE: Too much money for what you get.
B003Y5B7K0|1|This is a pretty cruddy lock. It is made of a rubbery type material so it stretches. My 2.5 yr old can shimmy the doors apart. Its only attached permanently on one side, so the other side just slips right off. Great idea, but poorly executed. I would not recommend or purchase again.
B00H3KWJ4U|5|Great!  We use them everyday.  Easy to wash, durable, can go in dishwasher, freezer, etc and still look great.  We originally had fancy glass containers - but these are much easier to use.  Tops come off easy, but stay on tightly enough a baby can't break through!
B0010PW3A4|2|My daughter was too small to use this carrier on it's own so we bought the newborn insert. Well, she hated it, it looked uncomfortable and didn't fit well in the carrier itself. So we're waiting until she is the requisite weight to use the carrier without the insert. The problem now however, is that the babies body is right up against yours with this carrier. As a result, they have no room to move (which my daughter hated) and can't look around very well either (she also hated this). The biggest problem is that for the baby to be comfortably seated in this carrier, they're legs must be able to open wide enough to go around your torso. My daughter is small, but at three months still cannot accomplish this, so here it sits in the shelf on the closet unused. In the meantime, I've gotten an inexpensive infantino flip that works much better for us. She can sit in her own little seat that's attached to me without having to get her legs around my torso. It also offers her a bit of wiggle room and more freedom to look around. I'm hoping as she gets bigger, we will have better luck with this carrier, but for now, I wish I had waited to purchase it.
B00KBGTRAC|5|We are using this for our busy 8-month-old everywhere. Love the size. We use it for play-dates, in the yard, while cooking or doing other chores. Some reviews mentioned unsafe screws- ours does not have that issue- maybe they fixed it.
B003T9ZY0K|5|My 7 month old loves this rattle. She shakes it around and also loves to chew on the ears. Good quality!
B0018M0V6C|2|My one year old wants desperately to sit in the chair, but she just can't quite get in on her own (and she is a climber - she loves to climb stairs, in and out of bed, whatever.)  It has a tall base so she has to climb up to get in by grabbing the flimsy back, which nearly tips the chair over.  Then she tries to turn around but it's really narrow and by the time she gets there she has basically slid out of it again.  The chair is constantly in danger of tipping over, and it's made of flimsy material.  I do not recommend.
B009WQKW4C|2|I took a lot of time looking for a portable swing. I settled on this one based on my checklist and reviews. Unfortunately, after using it for a few weeks, I am not happy with it.<br /><br />Positives: Cute colors. Simple to put together (my 11 year old daughter did it for me). Easy to fold up and put away. 2 sitting positions. The buckle system is good. I like how the seat cradles more than other swing seats I saw in my search.<br /><br />Cons: Very loud clicking sound when adjusting the swing level. I would like to go from a good speed at first then lower it when the child falls asleep. Impossible to do unless the child is a heavy sleeper. - The toy bar is cute but just sits in place and easily falls off if played with. I do not put it on. - Worst of all, the swinging motion shuts off after a period of time. This is my biggest issue. It was the first thing I checked for because I DID NOT want a timer swing. Nowhere did it say the swing motion stops after a certain amount of time. She would be sound asleep, the swing motion stops, and she wakes up angry. I wanted a steady swing motion for as long as I chose to keep it on. I checked other sites as well as the actual brand page and nowhere did it mention timed swing. So maybe I missed this somewhere. - Also, the swing motion is very slow, she is a very tiny one and it should be faster on the highest setting.<br /><br />So I can't recommend this product based on my experience. I could have just gotten a &#34;dud&#34;. Good luck in your search!
B004ECJWK4|3|These items work great if they fit your door. Unfortunately I have modern wooden doors and they are a little thicker so these did not work for us.  I wish this company offered larger versions for thicker doors.
B001A4IDN6|5|Absolutely recommended! This product is beautiful. It looks very real! It is very precise on its size. It has a lovely basket. The wicker is just impeccable....  I would take this to my own real picnic!
B001C3I1AA|3|Bottle warmers are extremely important for my household. We make 2-3 bottles at a time and stick them in the fridge to have ready for my daughter. We have been through a few bottle warmers and came across this one. It was one of the most expensive of the 3 but knew we would spend good money if it was a good quality warmer.  My husband immediately did not like it because you have to fill water up and check to see if it is always full every time you use the warmer.  I personally do not mind it because it is really easy to fill since you just pour it in w/o much work.  The bottle warms up fast but if you use Dr. Brown bottles it never warms the top half of the bottle. We use both Dr. Brown & Avent.  Even w/ Avent bottles we have to warm is 2x to get it warm enough for my daughter to drink w/o problems.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the switch! They have it on the bottom back of the warmer and it is hard to get to sometimes on the counter. I get they wanted to hide the switch b/c, hey who wants to see the switch on the front but it is inconvenient to have the switch on the bag especially since the switch is side to side. It's hard to turn on and off w/ one hand.  I also wish it would turn off by itself. If you do not turn off the switch it warms up, turns &#34;off&#34; just  but goes back on. The only want to turn off the warmer completely is hit the switch back to off. Sometimes when we get up at 3 am w/ my daughter and are not &#34;all there&#34; b/c of lack of sleep  we accidentally leave the warmer on and not hit the switch and it stays on for hours and hours.<br /><br />I give the bottle 4 stars but my husband would give it just 2.
B004CS7PW2|4|Has a beautiful sheen and color. Packaging neel's to be repackaged to give as a gift.
B001IACJQ4|4|I bought this for my daughter, who is expecting her first baby. Her and her husband had no trouble putting it together but found that after a couple of weeks, it started squeaking loudly. Her husband sprayed a lubricant on it and it hasn't been a problem since. She loves it.
B00O5IU8SM|5|Unbelievable
B00P8R866K|3|I like the product.  It does exactly what it is designed to do.  A couple of issues.  It does not comes with nothing.  It is exactly what it says it is.  A toy hammock.  That's it.  There are no instructions.  No hardware to hang the hammock.  Just the hammock.  I wasn't sure what to hang it with to withstand the weight of the stuffed animals I had purchased it to hold.  So, I finally went with some medium-sized picture hanging nails.  There are loops on the ends but as I said, no instructions.  It's very utilitarian.  It's a hammock.  It holds toys.  It's a toy hammock.  I will say that the material it is made out of is very durable.  It bears weight extremely well.  I do like the product.  I just really didn't expect to receive just a hammock in a plastic bag.
B0036WNB50|1|Loved the product then one day without warning the picture stopped working!  Just went black (just after the warrenty expired of course!
B002BXOMJY|4|My 18m old is obsessed with Elmo, and it was time to get him more bed stuffs; I couldn't find any cute Elmo bed sets, but this one was on sale so I went with it. I don't like the whole construction zone thing.. However, it arrived today and I really like how bright the colors are, and was pleasantly surprised at how soft it was. My older son uses a fleece set (after many trial & errors of fabrics), this one I expected to just be cotton feeling, but it's actual microfibery feeling. Even the comforter! The comforter is also bigger than the crib comforter he has--which was too small, so I'm really happy about that.<br />Just wish they made a cuter design.
B001G4YULO|5|Love these!  They're great to have on hand when you're out somewhere and baby drops the pacifier!  We use them all the time.
B00AQ0962C|5|I love this diaper bag.  timi and leslie bags are fabulous and have excellent features making them worth the cost. Very versatile - both a backpack, stroller bag or a strap purse.  It's \\"manly enough\\" that my husband will carry it.  It holds 1-2 small outfits, a bottle, a few diapers and several toys, wipes, etc.  I LOVE the internal wristlet/clutch bag with included credit card slots.  It's perfect to grab to run into the store.  There is a hook so you never lose your keys.  The pockets are perfect.  The material is so soft and feels like real leather, but it's wipeable.  This diaper bag great, I highly recommend timi & leslie bags to any Mom.
B0002ZOI92|5|I absolutely love this swing. My son has been using it since he was 2 weeks old. I don't know why previous posts said it doesn't recline because my son had no problems laying in it- it is much more reclined than the full-size swings. He loves the lights and music and I like that you can have just the music on w/o the lights, which helps him go to sleep. He also likes the hanging fish. I carry it all over the house- much more useful than a full-size swing. Yes, the bar is low and you have to be careful not to bump the baby's head when taking the baby out of the swing, however it is a travel swing and is made to be portable. If they made it bigger, it would be more cumbersome. It was easy to put together, too.
B0057ECYTO|5|good product, timely delivery
B003F6XCOC|5|my daughter loved it!
B0031AO1OW|4|some of the holes didn't match up, had to make/move them.
B001SUXVE8|5|I purchased this for my grandson's room. It look great and is just as pictured. Also it's easy to apply.
B000G22Y7O|5|Great product, keeps the dogs in one place.
B00A4YA14C|4|I was in love with the idea of this pelican. It does the general job. The mesh net does get mildewy and smelly, but you can remove it to wash it. Unfortunately, since you can remove it to wash it, it falls apart quite easily. I'm constantly having to click the mesh back into place using the plastic ring that clips in the pelican's beak. This is annoying. That being said, it doesn't fall over or fall off the wall like the suction cup ones did. I don't think a perfect tub toy storage system exists. This one has flaws, but is as close as you are going to get.
B00EB8WCCG|5|Great product for the price
B0045FRZKE|5|These are adorable, they are the perfect size, and they are very easy to apply. Some of the decals started popping up a little bit so I just got them slightly damp when I reapplied them and I haven't had a problem since. They have been up for 2 months now. I feel like I got a very good deal with these, I highly recommend.
B009YDCGVK|5|good for toddler less than 3 years. It is small form my 3 and half year old but he likes it most.
B009RPH4MG|5|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this mattress!!! What a difference a mattress can make! Our house is too big for a crib so we decided to go with the pack n play. After the...what feel like cardboard....mat got wet from a bottle spilling we were about to replace the whole thing. I then got the idea in my head to see if they make mattresses for them. And they do! I bought it right away and have been using it for a few months and it works perfectly. Some people saying the mattress is hard....a baby is sleeping on it. It's supposed to he hard. It's actually softer than a crib mattress! Highly recommend!
B001OC5UMQ|5|Best thing ever to keep my dogs controled if i dont want them around ceirtain room in my house. They look nice and they are stronger than what they actually look in the picture
B00VU4XT8K|5|I purchased this bag for my daughter and her second child! So far it's great! Love the separate bags for toy storage and all of the compartments! So much more organized! And what a fabulous value for the price!
B003XMWF5A|2|The bowls I received look nothing like the ones pictured here.  The ones sent were square shaped and blue.  The plastic was very thin and see-through.  It looked disposable.  The photo and description are deceiving.
B0059L6NQK|5|We love this diaper bag!  We initially bought the Okkatots Travel Depot bag but realized soon that was too big, even for airplane rides.  So we bought this bag instead - it's stylish for both my husband and I to wear.  It's got a lot of pockets to hold various things.  It's spacious and fits quite a bit and we take it on plane rides now instead of the Travel Depot.  Once we tried to cram the bag full and saw that the zipper was tearing so we don't do that anymore.  One suggestion to the manufacturer is to make the insulated pocket bigger - I can only fit one sippy cup with handles in there, and we usually like to bring at least two on outings.  All in all, an awesome diaper bag.
B0017359UA|1|Liquid pours out of the bottom of bottle. My baby has not used product due to it leaking. I'm very disappointed
B0056Z2BTM|5|Purchased for a co-worker of my husband's. Everyone loved it and said we out did ourselves. For the price this is an awesome set.
B00009IMB4|5|Expensive but really worth it.  Chair is very stable, and looks like \\"furniture,\\" instead of cheap kid plastic junk.  Assembly required, but it is very easy to put together.  Our son loves the chair--wish we'd bought it for his older sister years ago!
B003N49ML8|2|This cup looked like a great cup… I had another Nuby cup, and it was great.  However this cup has a rubbery straw piece that you need to line up perfectly in order for it not to leak and work properly.  When you have a screaming toddler next to you, you don't have the time to put it together.  Once it is properly put together, it works fine, and doesn't leak… however, in the real world of motherhood, this is cup is not practical.
B0038JDAJ8|5|What can I say _ Sophie is amazing - I think it was a little pricey but
B005UV0UU4|5|Do yourself a favor make sure you Need all the crap you are buying. WE never used this now or baby is too big LOL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005IWM7TW|5|I recommend taking a liberal amount of plastic shopping bags from the supermarket to function as waste bags.  The kiddies can now do their business in the back of the minivan!
B007Z0JBM6|5|My Grand daughter loves it
B007D1NWD6|3|we tried to attach it to our bathroom- it felt down next night.
B007IERG62|5|Very sturdy and strong clip. My son likes to chew on the fabric part
B005H2KRTA|5|I got these for my 15 month old self-feeder as we will be taking a trip to grandma's house and I wanted to reduce the food spillage. While eliminating food spillage is never an option, I would have to say that these have worked wonders for getting more food into his mouth and less onto his shirt.
B0012QQQ7C|5|the packaging was unusal and the candy was quality mints.
B000056HNM|1|This is flimsy and of poor quality. Particle board. I thought it was going to fall apart in the store when I was putting something that weighed about 10 pounds on it to test how it would hold up a baby. Don't waste your money.
B000S9IQA4|5|Very nice
B00A77OJNK|5|I have a big 2 year old and needed a lightweight stroller for a San Diego sea world trip. This stroller more than met my expectations. So easy to collapse when boarding the plane. Was able to hang bags from the handles making it easier to manage the carry ons. The access to the basket is a little annoying but when you consider all the pros - lightweight, carries up to 50 lb child, ease of maneuverability and collapsing and how easy it is to throw in the car that is a small thing to deal with!
B004DC9TFS|5|Great stroller, coming out of the package it looked big heavy & bulky. When I actually picked it up, I was surprised at how light & compact it was (fit in the back of my Forester, w/ front wheel detached). It rides incredibly smooth, the kids seem to love it! Very well made & sturdy. You definitely get what you pay for with this. The best stroller available
B00GXTTPKI|5|Makes it quick and easy to remove those little noses!
B00CYRCB22|1|This isn't the blue one, despite that being what the image shows. I really wanted the blue one which I couldn't find anywhere in Canada. I finally decided to spend hours driving to the States to pick it up across the boarder because I wanted the blue one that much more than the pink one, the pink one being readily available where I live. Then after all that it wasn't even the one on the picture. Buying this was a huge waste of time and money.
B00AM5NTIS|5|These are perfect! I chose this product after reading lots of reviews and I also liked that they had a larger capacity than other pouches. The 7 ounce size is great, especially for a toddler. I live in the middle east and the brands of disposable pouches I used to feed my toddler are the equivalent of $4 each here, if I can find them. These are the perfect answer. They are so much cheaper and I can control the quality and freshness of his food. My toddler recognized what to do with it and could hold it easily and suck out all the food. I find them very easy to fill with just a spoon and I bought a small cleaning brush to clean out the spout and insides and they clean up easily. I have put them through the dishwasher, too, and that works well. I have only had them a couple weeks so I can't comment on longevity, but I will try to update this later with that information. Great product!!
B0036Z3DDC|5|We love this night light. My daughter likes the fact that she can take it to bed with her if she wants to.
B003KMW4EA|5|I love Dr. Browns nipples as well as pacifiers. My daughter does so well with these. She has acid reflux but Dr. Browns bottles help her and that makes us all happy!
B00AEBV00Y|5|10 points.
B0042QE65I|3|Not made with the greatest material. But certainly appropriate for girls 10-15.  Good sized bag and nice to have options of a arm or shoulder bag.
B00BUD6VKO|3|great idea!  this worked well when our baby was a newborn but now is almost too small to use in the way we used to be able to wrap her in it (she's coming up on 4 months).  we always wind up rewrapping her or struggling to pull the hood over her head post bath when we have it secured so it can be 'handsfree'.  it is a 'plusher' towel but it pills like crazy and the fibers usually wind up on all of the other laundry.
B003Z66X5W|3|I thought this gadget was a little overpriced for what it was.  I've only used it a few times which for almost $20 not worth the money
B000BKTEYC|5|Though after buying this our living room looks even more like a baby playground, I'm glad we did. My son loves the monkeys and the spinning light up thing. It is also very easy to clean, his diaper leaked all over it once, and it washed out great. The bright colors, and different textures in this center are great.  It folds down pretty well, and slides under our coffee table, we love the height adjustment feature. <br />
B00L9NR672|5|The good thing is that you can turn off the lights if you like and it runs so quietly. This is the first time I've bought such a devise.
B002VWRPZ8|5|I hesitated to buy this since there are so many toys just like it out there. (You know the ones - cute animal/doll with attached rattle, ribbons, crinkle fabric, etc etc. All variations on the same thing.) We own a few said toys, but this mermaid is by far my daughter's favorite! She especially loves the mirror and seahorse teether. Our mermaid's hair isn't quite as tame as the stock photo's - in fact, it sticks up all over the place, but I think that adds to its charm.
B004FVNJYY|1|I was disappointed as this plush Mickey Mouse has a rattle in it when it moves.  I did not know that I had purchased a Mickey Mouse baby plush.  Also, the Mickey Mouse pants are not a deep dark red color but more of a burnt orange-red color.  I was surly looking for a plush Mickey Mouse that had real red pants and no rattle for my four year old niece.  I thought I was getting a plush stuffed animal without sound/rattles.  Not sure if I will give it to my four year old niece or not?  Wish the pants were a dark red and not the color they came in (looked faded in color).
B00YM2XVLC|5|Cute hat. Thin fabric (which I was looking for) I did not want a hat made of heavy fabric for my baby.
B008ZT66JC|5|Life saver. Finally I can prevent my toddler from getting into the closet.  Very happy with the order.  The item arrived on time and I did not have any issues with it.  Very happy.
B0002JE9CE|3|Just bought this from a local Target tonight.  Instructions are mediocre, and could be improved - for instance, why is it necessary to insert the rails under the mattress then shorten the rails by a peg?  Unless your mattress is made of granite, you could easily get the right width by measuring, then wedging the mattress to the bottom of the rails.  The way the instructions are stated you have to simultaneously hold your mattress up far enough to push in the peg with a screwdriver while also constricting the rail to fit into the next closest peg - not easy at all if you're installing without someone to help. <br /> <br />Also, the pegs themselves are of poor quality - one on our assembly would not slide back through the hole until I pulled it out of the rod, straightened, and reinserted it.  If I'd left it as it was the assembly could shift with weight, negating the entire reason I purchased the product. <br /> <br />Finally, getting the fabric assembly around the rails was very difficult.  The structure must be taut, which explains some of the difficulty - you don't want your child to get caught in loose fabric - but I'm not sure why this part doesn't come assembled from the manufacturer. <br /> <br />Haven't tested the assembled product yet.  If there are flaws during use I'll post again.
B0045I6IA4|5|mi bebe lo usa para dormir desde que tiene 20 d&iacute;as de nacido
B00NSJ8QWY|5|I absolutely love this car seat. It is sturdy and has all of the features of the more expensive ones for a lower price. It is roomy and grows with your child. There is removable padding that you use for newborns. This is a very big, heavy seat. If you have a small vehicle it may not fit, or you may not be able to put the front seat back. I have an SUV and it fits fine.
B0034G61DC|5|Best playmat ever. I bring it everywhere and daughter loves rolling around in it with her toys
B0047RI5YU|2|I put the milk in the bottle, I set the bottle in the warmer and just wait for it to warm up.. there's no timer, you just test it. This is the same thing I was doing with warm water before I bought this.<br />Also, it took about 7 minutes from the fridge.<br />I am a pumping mom that bags my breastmilk and I keep it in the fridge, was looking for a way to produce consistant temperatures when warming the milk from the fridge, this is not the solution for me.<br />One positive, it does have a nice cord hiding bottom (unless its full of water then it's kind of a pain if the cord doesn't go in the right place it causes the whole device to sit unlevel and spill)
B00KBGTRAC|5|Lightweight and sturdy! Easily accessible and easy to store and take along. Wonderful product.
B000BH79QA|5|These are so cute and a fun addition to any bath time! My daughter loves them and I was impressed you got so many in a pack for such a good price! Definitely value for money.
B00ASI748A|5|I bought this stroller online thinking it would be great to throw in the car and take on shopping trips with the car seat clicking into it.  Well....it's NOT so good for shopping, as it is fairly heavy and quite large!  NOT the type of stroller I'd envisioned as being an easy way to tote baby around while<br />shopping at department stores, lol.  However, it actually is billed as and meant to be a jogging stroller and for THAT purpose, I would highly recommend.  It is very sturdy, has nice brakes easy to use, convenient, well made, I'm impressed by the quality.  The one annoying feature is that the 'cell phone holder' does NOT accommodate my Galaxy S4, and certainly wouldn't handle larger ones, either, though one can always throw it down below in a diaper bag.  This stroller is ideal for suburban lifestyle...keep in garage, take it out and walk or run around neighborhood.  It can also handle trails and the beach on firmer, wetter sand.  Be aware, though, that it is NOT lightweight for throwing into and taking out of car, or trying to take down stairs if one lives in an apartment or elevated home.  Once on the ground and going, it's great for it's intended purpose, but get another, lighter one if you want to use it in retail stores.
B00389VFH2|5|They are diaper pail refills, what can I say.  But I recommend purchasing them in bulk - when you run out it's always cheapest to buy them on Amazon, and even with Prime 2 days is too long to wait for new diaper pail refills.
B006ZVV0NO|4|Great.  A couple of instances of extreme cold, extreme heat (we seem to have that these days in the same week in Southeast OH/Northern KY) they have fallen off, but super easy to put back on.  Now if i could just remember not to roll down the window with them in place.
B0011URFRE|5|This car seat is at least two times heavier than any other car seat I've ever used before, but it feels a lot more durable.  I read a lot of reviews talking negatively about the crotch strap, but I also read one review where they said if you took the crotch strap out and moved it forward one space, remembering to actually move it forward in the plastic of the car seat and not just the padding, you wouldn't have a problem.  This reviewer was completely correct, we moved it forward one space and there is PLENTY of room.  My niece absolutely loves the seat because she gets her own cup holder and cubby holes for her toys, but I know my sister and I love it because she can stay in the 5-point harness for up to 65 lbs.  She's turning four in a month and she's only about 38 lbs, so we can definitely use it until she's at least 5, the recommended age for 5-point harnesses.  It's a little heavy to move, so we can't as easily shift it from car to car, but I definitely feel a lot safer with her in it, especially when we're driving on 70 mph highways.
B0006FHB5Q|5|I have owned this product for several months now and find it terrific. The suction cups are really strong, much better than I expected. And it's for kids and adults alike.
B002SG7JSK|5|It is soft, safe and sturdy. The product is better than anything you get from the department store. It serves the purpose of protecting the toddler from getting hurted.
B000IDSLOG|4|The truth is, I really wanted my kid to like this. A lot. They're so popular! It squeaks, it has lots of different shapes and what kid doesn't like to chew on plastic things? So it's perfect, but for some reason my kid isn't a fan..
B001UI6X98|4|love it! the baby loves it and it keeps her happy. all that matters! so I say everyone who is looking for a binky should get one :-)
B004LWZZ2G|3|I like these bowls. They're small and perfect for feeding my young son. Easy to wash. However, the lids are nearly impossible to snap on, and then when I finally get them snapped on, it's nearly impossible to get them off! I have to use great force to get the lids off, and when the bowl is full of puréed baby food, you can imagine how messy than can get. I would not buy these again and will look for another product to expand my bowl collection. The lids are just a total deal breaker for these bowls.
B00A0FGPFO|4|The product works well and works fast.  It doesn't take up much space at all, and is easy to use.<br />It has a few downsides, but they might not be of concern to other buyers.  Mainly, you have to keep a chart around to know how much water to use.  The included piece to measure states the amount of liquid, but doesn't say how much water to use for different types of milk: from the fridge, frozen, formula.  Either different marking on the water container or a better chart (maybe a magnet for the fridge, or a sticker for the machine or something) would be helpful.  The only place where it says how much water is needed to heat an amount of milk is the manual.  So, you have to either memorize the amount of water needed, or keep the manual around.<br />As for use, I don't use it very often.  I rarely need to heat up milk.  It has come in handy a few times, and is worth having around.<br />It can accommodate a wide range of bottle types (I have used Medela, Evenflo, and Breastflow).
B00LYCR718|5|super soft for cleaning baby's face
B00B40QSTM|5|I accidentally initially posted my review under seller feedback, so now it's here where it should be :)<br /><br />These stickers are way cuter than I even expected from the pictures, love them! I was nervous that the numbers wouldn't be big enough to see in pictures, but you can definitely see them clearly, and the colors are perfect- vibrant enough to stand out but not too bright. I've been wearing a black top in each picture, but the colors could easily go with many other tops and still look so nice. I also like that the colors aren't too gender specific since we obviously have started taking picture before finding out the baby's gender.<br /><br />The quality is great too. I recently wore one for a couple hours as we walked around a garden to find a nice picture spot (sitting, bending over, etc) and it barely wrinkled. They stay put but come off easily enough not to ruin the clothes you put them on.<br /><br />They make such adorable photos for pregnancy/baby book memories, I'm excited to keep using them as my belly (and baby) grows! They also sent a sample of a 3 month sticker (for once baby arrives) and it is so darling I just might have to make another purchase soon!
B002DE7BH6|1|I love the looks of this stroller and how lightweight it is, however it is poorly made. The cup holder on the tray does not stay in and one of the straps that holds the seat up arrived torn.<br /><br />Update- after having this stroller for a couple months, you cant even steer it without struggle. Wish I didn't waste my money on a cheap stroller. I guess its good for quick trips or short walks.
B00JXN54DI|5|We received the HALO Bassinest prior to our daughter being born and as a parent, we fell in love with it!  The features really are amazing.  I loved the swivel feature as it allows me to pull my daughter closer to the bed without having to move the entire unit.  I also love the “soothing center”, which includes a nightlight, music and soothing sounds, a feeding timer, and a vibration mode.  My favorite feature is definitely the nightlight, but I also love the sound and vibration feature.  While I haven’t used the feeding timer much, I think it’s a great feature to have on this Bassinest.  The only downside to this product is that you don't know whether your son or daughter will like it. I think that's the challenge with any baby product.  Overall though, the Bassinest is really an amazing sleeper!  The features set it apart from other sleepers, making it great for babies and their parents!
B002HRFO14|3|It's a small plate but cute.
B010CDL4V8|5|Couldn't love this cover more! Using it for my 4th child and wish I could have had one for the other kids! Besides being adorable, the baby can't pull it off me like the apron style I previously used. Will be buying more for my expecting friends!
B00BHJ9ZN6|5|Beautiful! Thanks for the super fast shipping!
B005UL559K|3|I was looking for something without the typical baby designs and I love the pattern on the hood, but that's it. Other than that corner it is a well-made, but very typical soft baby blanket. I'm happy with it, but for the price I would have liked for it to have more interesting details or something else to make it unique.
B001B19D7I|5|Im paranoid about everything to begin with and after my wife and I had our first son my paranoia really kicked in. We did the same things most new parents do. Buy all the most expensive stuff for our lil one even though a lot of the cheaper items are just as good if not better. We wised up pretty quick to that stuff though. For me though, something like a car seat is a safety feature that is worth paying extra for.     We have two of these seats now for a 2 year and under 1 year old. They love the seats (compared to nothing else other than the carry seat that snapped into the stroller). The seat is very plush and looks very comfortable. The guys at the fire department said all seats HAVE to pass certain criteria, some just have more bells and whistles than others (some of those being additional safety features).     Installing the seat gets easier the more you do it. I had the fire department show me and then I did it after so they could check. One thing I was told not to do is put my weight on the seat, push on the metal bars on the side of the seat. I can cause stress fractures in the plastic of the seat otherwise.     These seats were produced probably a month or so before they were on our door step. An instruction book is tucked under the seat cushion which i like. Some of the pictures could be better to help you figure out where the belt should go but its not too difficult to figure out. On bumpy roads the side pieces keep my boys heads from flying around too much. My oldest tucks his cars between the seat and cushion. The seat is equipped with hardware to fit into the newer cars so you don't have to use the seat belt but can just as easily go into an older model (which i have) without any trouble. After the seat is installed securely it stays put. I check it from time to time and i haven't noticed any loosening of the belts. The seat shouldn't move once installed. I was also told not to put protectors under the seat since they aren't used in the safety testingof the seat.    I strongly recommend this seat to anyone looking to get a really nice seat. Almost forgot to mention, my parents bought the same seat to go in their vehicle so i wouldn't have to change seats when they drive the oldest around. GREAT product.
B001P307EK|5|Good value
B0006FHFYS|5|My baby has severe gas and digestion problems.  The Cradle Swing moves fast enough and with a long enough arc to assist her with her tummy issues.  I also like it because of its removable tray.  Our old baby swing didn't have the option of removing the tray and my daughter would constantly kick her legs and hit the tray.  She loves the Cradle Swing.
B007NG5UF4|5|This is an excellent monitor. It has a lot of great features. I love that you can talk to the child from the parent unit.
B00Q1CYTBC|5|ORDER PLACED<br />January 31, 2015  got Feb 27..only thing bad...way to long to recieve...but is so cute
B00CWN3FRS|5|DH put together in less than fifteen minutes. Hope LO enjoys it! Seems soft and interactive.
B00R8D48XW|5|I received a discount to purchase this item. Although I would pay full price because this is the best teething necklace I have owned. My son has two others and this one feels the best quality. It also works. I was skeptical with my other teething necklaces because they would be fussy regardless, but on days he doesn't wear this necklace he is definitely fussy. When he is wearing he has been my happy boy even with four teeth coming in at once. I also think it goes with anything and has a neutral look so could work well for a girl too.
B003REAPE2|5|this is a great gift for new parents, it has pretty much everything you need to start off with, and its all contained in a nice case to keep it all organized, its a great shower gift.
B00081J3N6|4|I know that it is the point, but these are almost impossible to get off without prying them off with something. Adult-proof as well as baby-proof!
B002HOQOVQ|5|Exactly what I was looking for with the waterproof! & exactly what I was expecting from this product! Thanks so much.
B00OLRKI1E|4|Click tight instillation is amazing! However, the straps are difficult to tighten.
B002IVTPIW|5|Very good product.  We use this for our granddaughter, it is quick and easy to inflate and deflate.
B002QYW8LW|5|Bought this for my daughter's two teeth. She grabs for it all the time and loves to teeth on it.
B005NK10E2|4|Works great. Connects well with monitor.
B004ZHXWB8|5|Excellent product
B0016ZX7AI|1|Overly priced my son bit a whole in this cheap piece of material. Don't waste your coins.
B00021D1GC|5|i use it for my 18 months old son and 5 years old daughter.  very easy to use.  just put some on a wet sponge than rub their face.  after that using shampoo and soap to wash their hair and body.  i'll use water flashing on their face to make sure all cleaning product off.  but actually its no need to rinse off.
B009UQPSE8|5|These are super bright and are great for hallways or bathrooms. I wouldn't use  them in bedrooms.
B000H3FRA8|5|Nice product. Velcro sticks very well!
B0033G9ZVI|5|I loved it!. Everything is easy.<br />Easy to clean, easy to pull the tray out, easy to fold, perfect fit for my 7-8 months baby. Totally recommended.
B0056S88AK|4|I really like this product. I know there were some complaints about it - but it works well for us. Certainly better than other options we have tried for our 7 month old.
B004FV6748|5|My daughter is now 7 months old and is ready to ride in the shopping cart, rather than her infant car seat.  I ordered the Itzy Ritzy in the mail and LOVE IT!  It is easy to put on the cart and my little gal loves to sit up and look around.  The first thing she did when I put her in the seat was to put the strap from the itzy ritzy in her mouth.  I was so thankful that it wasn't the cart strap (yuck!).  It is washable and easy to store in the car so we always have it.  I love the rodeo drive design.  It's not very girly, but that is fine with me :)
B002WDEIVA|5|nice to have in the event of spit ups, which are inevitable. Makes it a bit harder to put a cover on, but worth the hassle.
B000CSBP9K|5|When my kids were babies, I used a similar long sleeved washable vinyl bib that really protected their clothes. This Baby Bjorn smock/bib is very similar. It completely covers their clothes and can be machine washed when needed. This is the second one I've purchased for grand kids. Great product!
B00U1MV77C|4|Great product needs instructions.
B007HDPX9G|4|Not cheaply made, and I especially tike the buckle. It practically glides! Down side is it is not compact and the child tray is unreachable for my little baby.
B00ZA9FJAM|5|great product
B001U0PVWG|2|I bought this not because I'm passionate about co-sleeping, but just wanting my newborn to sleep on something besides my chest. Not enough incline, the nightlight and the sound are on a very short timer. My baby won't sleep in it, could just be him though...
B00DY6EQW0|5|Great product
B002UD65SG|4|I bought this for a different brand of play yard, and it's not a perfect fit, but it works.  It is very soft, and I think my daughter is very cozy sleeping on it!  I like it much better than just a regular sheet, and it is good quality.
B00FG6G7XM|5|really nice product and very easy to install
B00CQ9UUK8|4|It doesn't seem to fit my LO quite right, but after two years of use, it has stayed in great shape!  Very durable and no wear on it, except coloring on the inside from hard water.
B00INF1KF8|1|These are really, really cheaply made.  Several of them had 'runs' in them similar to when you get runs in panty hose.  They unravel after one wash and are very thin.  They're functional I suppose, but seriously cheap.
B007AAMXTE|5|one of a kind bag. Very trendy, sturdy and roomy.
B007F9YPDM|5|we love it  very easy to order & fast delivery
B0057ECYS0|3|I really like this product but I usually wash the bottles again after because it has a weird smell. It also rusts a lot but i pour vinegar in it for an hour to get rid of the rust.
B00BFQ5BMU|5|Bought this for my Jeep Wrangler to keep my seats clean from my 18 month old.  Love it!! It has a nice pocket on the front so I can put snacks in it for an easy to reach option for him when we are traveling.
B0054YZDWC|5|must haves!!  we take them with us on the go and it is essential!
B000SAWEJW|3|I had been looking at this stroller for awhile.  I was drawn to it because of its look, the fact that it is an umbrella stroller, sturdy not flimsy.  It also can hold up to 55 lbs and I love the extended shade on the canopy.  Its comfortable to push, my son and daughter are both comfortable in it (they each have one, my son is 22 months and my daughter is 4 1/2 yrs old.) we are going to disney and I wanted to have them for the trip - easy to carry around, lightweight, seat goes down nicely and has a big shade for sun protection.  I put it together easy enough.  I used it a few times and the wheels do squeak - I have not yet used WD40 but I plan to.  When I went to fold it yesterday and put it in my car - it was as if the folding \\"mechanism\\" just froze.  It took me 6-7 times times of just trying again and again to get it to fold and I am doing it correctly.  The first few times I folded it no problem - and the two levers you need to use are easy enough but like I said - I had some difficulties yesterday. Overall I am happy with the stroller - we'll see - that might change once I am on vacation and trying to fold the strollers as everyone is boarding the Disney buses!!!!!
B000U1XHEK|5|We LOVE this car seat. We bought the infant seat and loved that one as well.  This chair fits in United's small seats on flights, as well as our older Euro cars.  We live in Europe and had a lot of seats to choose from, US and European.  This seat is far and away the best buy and wonderful quality.  Our son gets to see out the windows of the car, he is comfortable for our long flights back to the states.  The padding on the seat is very comfortable. The one glitch is that it does not work with most carseat travel systems for getting through the airport. I often have to travel without my husband.  So I bought a small travel folding luggage cart, like people use for other carry on luggage and strapped it on.  That worked so well, when we landed after an 11 hour flight, my son was still asleep.  I put the chair on the cart, secured the straps and wheeled him off the plane and through customs.  Good thing as the stroller I gate checked did not arrive, yet again.  We are now buying a second one for my husbands car, after looking again at all the options we could not be happier!
B001LRAJDE|5|This was one of my daughter's favorite toys when she was a baby (a great teething toy), and we have since purchased one for almost every expecting couple we know; it's one of our \\"go-to\\" baby gifts.  It's cute, simple, and the sounds aren't too loud (but definitely audible).
B004GYAGBY|5|Great product. Shipped within hours of ordering. Couldn't be happier.
B001OC5UNA|5|This works great!  Our kids are two 50lb pit bulls that have restricted use of the house when we are not home.  Easy install.  Gate works well.
B002KCMSPQ|2|Great idea, poor implementation.  The pad is too light which causes it to move and fold up onto itself or out of position is you have any ceiling fans, AC, heaters, or even a breeze cause by someone walking by the changing table too quickly.  My wife found a different disposable pad that if much heavier and I greatly prefer that one.  (Sorry, but I don't know the name of that one.  But try to looking for one with more weight/thickness.
B00N1ZEFIO|5|Great sheets, and we've gone through multiple brands (Carters, etc). Reasonably priced, cute print, and very soft -- even after just one washing. (We've found other brands that take tons of washes before they're close to soft). Someone reviewed that these are too &#34;fleecy&#34; to use during summer, but it's a super fine fleece (if you'd even call it that), and seems quite breathable. We'll be using it year round.
B006YPTWHC|5|This bottle is a God send for sure! I have literally tried every \\"breastfeeding\\" bottle to no avail (i.e. comotomo, mimijumi, Adiri, wide neck Dr. Browns, etc...). I purchased the mOmma as a last ditch effort, purely based on how the nipple is shaped more like a real breast. I thought the nipple construction made so much more sense than the nipples that stick out like 2 inches :) Anyways, I didnt have high hopes, since every other bottle never worked out very well...<br /><br />When I recieved the item, I immediately tried it out. Not only did he take a bottle from ME (which has never happened before), but he latched on perfectly right away! No crying, no thing, I was in SHOCK!!! He is 6 months old, so when I recieved this bottle I put the fast slow nipple on and it made it even better! I am so happy that I finally found something that works for my son. Now hubby and I can finally have that much needed date night without worrying that he wont eat while I am away! Lansinoh: If you are reading any of these reviews... THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!!!!!
B000UPSVPG|3|I don't mind the frumpiness so much, although it is disappointing when you spend so much money on a stroller and add an accessory that takes away from its aesthetics... However, I'm slightly concerned about the degree of sun protection. When the stroller is in full sun, this shade doesn't seem to filter out as much sun as I would want it to.
B004HFQOLI|5|I wished I received this before I when off to buy separate bottles, brushes, formula dispensers. This has everything you need to begin bottle feeding your baby.
B001GIOPH4|5|I highly recommend the Boppy pillow! It was VERY useful when breastfeeding - especially in those first weeks when we were both trying to get the hang of it! It helps hold the baby comfortably in my lap. The case was easy to remove and wash when needed. As my daughter grew we used it for tummy time. Now she can sit in the middle of it and not tip over. Great product!<br /><br />I also recommend getting the water-proof cover to go in between the pillow and the case.
B00ECHYTBI|5|Great monitor. Really love the temperature reading. Image is very clear and sound is very good also.
B0035ER8LM|1|This crib arrived and was missing all screws for the wheels. However, customer service has not contacted me and I bought this for a 11 day trip and it is now a waste of money without having the wheels installed. The company should have overnighted the screws for customer service. I will not buy any other product from them.
B00EM5D12I|1|totally different set, the one I rcvd looks ugly&cheap!
B000GY5OBK|3|I have been reviewing booster car seats because my 3 year old's Century seat is about to expire so she needs a new seat.  She is not yet tall or heavy enough to have just the belt positioning--she still needs a harness.  I am a little disturbed to read that some reviews state you can go from an infant seat to this booster seat.  so please be aware of your baby's size.      if your baby is under one year old they SHOULD NOT be in a seat like this. Babies 1 and under should still be rear facing EVEN IF they are over 20lb; the rule is 20lb AND 12 mths old. These types of boosters are made to go forward only. and the height restrictions on these seats are important.  even though alot of these types of boosters state 20-40 lbs. the height restrictions usually start around 34-35\\". average toddlers meet the weight but NOT the height restrictions so BE careful.      there are many choices to choose from in the \\"convertible\\" type car seats.  those are the seats that can go rear OR forward facing; made for babies too big for the infant carrier type seat, not tall enough for a booster, and the convertible usually go up to at least 40lb (many go up to 80lb) so your toddler has time to grow tall enough for a booster.     I know it can be inconvenient and frustrating to have to transition your kid through three seats and some can't afford it. but it is worth your kids life. Luckily, there are some seats made that can take your baby from newborn all the way to belt positioning--these are called 3 in 1 seats. they are a bit more in the beginning but you use the seat for six years.      The only drawback is that research does show infants are safer in the infant carrier plus its nice not to wake your little one up getting out of the car. so maybe some people could just go from an infant carrier to a 3 in 1--then you only have to buy two seats for one kid.
B008XKIEFC|5|My 16 month-old grandson loves it. It is easy to grasp, holds up under a toddler's abuse and the straw always stays in the liquid until it's gone.
B00QFVPIJQ|5|The best
B004P1IVXS|5|Very happy with the lamp. Just as pictured and described
B000H1ZG7Y|4|Satin binding matched plush well in color.  A little small because of it's square shape in comparison to other security blankets.
B0057WLBG8|5|My son is so in love with this blanket. He loves to cuddle with it. It goes great with his bed, too. I don't think the picture does it justice.
B001AMR690|5|The hinge was a little tough to figure out, but the rest was easy to out together. Glad we got the one with storage.
B007Z9719W|5|I was afraid my the stickers wouldn't stick to our textured walls, but they are doing great.  They are so cute too.
B004HMQNTE|1|These make the food taste bad and they smell so strong like rubber (like new cheap tennis shoes).  I can't use them.
B0090IBQSI|5|These are the only pacifiers my baby will take and these came faster then they said, only 3 days! Great service, great product!
B000N0SNHY|5|Just what you need to clean bottles. I use it for Dr Brown 4 oz bottles specifically, but it can be used for any bottle.  I'd say it's even long enough to wash 8 oz bottles. It comes with a suction cup stand that enables you to prop it up anywhere on the counter.  This feels more sanitary to me, so I use the stand.
B00E280NIK|5|Love them!!
B00EFQXLW4|5|Safe, lovely and very light weight. I love it and purchased two, one for my 6 month old and one for my 2 1/2 yr old.
B00G3XRDRQ|5|I absolutely love this stroller! I can't say I have any complaints (yet). I did a lot of research before buying a stroller and found this had everything I wanted! I take my twin girls, soon to be a year old, on walks/jogs every morning and they both really like it. The shades go down low enough to keep the early sun off. But also still keeps it visible for them to see out. I love how flat the seats recline, and how easy it is to move it from an upward position to a reclining position and back! It swivels and pushes very well, and goes over our gravel driveway nicely. It's been an awesome stroller and I take it with me everywhere I go!
B000YZD0QM|5|This car seat was used for my daughter after she grew out of the pumpkin seat.  Good sturdy seat.  One draw back is that it takes up a lot of space in the car.  Went on a trip with a friend and her 2 children and it took up more space than the car seats she had.  However, this seat felt much more sturdy and secure than the others.  I felt that my child was very safe.
B000BNQC58|5|My 21 month old son LOVES this turtle and so do I! The body is soft and the buttons are easy for him to use. It has a 45 minute timer so it will automatically turn off after 45 minutes which is nice.<br />It will glow in 3 different choices of colors: blue, green or a soft amber. The blue and green are bright so its fun to look at, but for sleep, I put it on the amber.<br />It covers the whole ceiling and comes down a little on the top of the walls.<br />It is worth the money. As he gets older, we can use the little book it came with to look at the real constellations.<br />I looked into the Dream Lite version and they are much smaller and feel cheaper and they don't do REAL constellations.
B00BQGQR36|4|We tried a few different sippy cups ans this was the only one my daughter would use. It's really great and easy for toddlers to use. I gave it a 4 only because I wish there was an easier way to clean the straw.
B00747GWTU|1|As others have noted, this shouldn't even be advertised as a rear facing car seat. There is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY to install this as a rear facing unit without having a very large and unacceptable level of wiggle room. I am amazed they are legally even allowed to sell this as a rear facing unit.<br /><br />It should also be noted that to install this as a rear facing unit, they ask you to use folded up towels to elevate the seat to the right height, but the towels will settle, compress, and move around over time. So the seat again becomes dangerously loose over the time as the towel changes position. Last time I am buying a Cosco product.
B00A4YA14C|5|This pelican toy holder is working out for us but is a bit smaller than I thought.  I got this because the suction-cup toy holders were not working on our tiles as they kept slipping down.  We use this product for holding the foam letters, numbers, and sea creatures.  So far so good.  After the kids are done playing, I pretend the pelican is very hungry and to feed it.  This helps with clean-up.  Then it's shower-time.  Once the toys are pretty dry, I grab the whole thing and place it in our rectangle garbage can for storage.  It's great that I'm not picking up after the kids and risk hurting my back.  Nice and neatly put away.  The only thing I would recommend to KidsKit is to make the backing better stabilized.  Currently it's a thick sort-of-flimsy backing.  Nonetheless, I'm glad we have this for one set of bathtoys.
B006WLDJWM|5|I am a bit of a carseat fanatic, and have thus owned more seats than I care to admit.  For example, for only one booster-aged child family member (who only rides in my car about three or four times per month!), I own four booster seats-- two high back and two backless.  That's in addition to the combination seat (a seat that is harnessed, then becomes a booster) seat I also own.<br /><br />I believe in keeping children harnessed as long as possible, so I don't even begin to use booster seats until children are at least six years old.  Therefore, each child who has ridden in a booster in my car has been a minimum of 40 pounds and a minimum of six years old.<br /><br />The Recaro Vivo booster is rated for use from 30 pounds, but I've never used it for a child that lightweight.  My comments about belt fit, therefore, do not address the fit of the belt for little kids (30-40 pounds or under age six).<br /><br />~~BELT FIT~~<br />The Vivo has red shoulder belt guides in the headrest and cut-outs in the base for the lap belt.  Both guides work extremely well.  The shoulder belt guides are open enough to allow the shoulder belt to slide easily, which is very important so extra slack isn't introduced should the child lean forward.  The lap belt guides are nice and low, which appropriately fits the lap belt agains the child's hips/upper thighs.  Again, this is important so there is reduced risk of abdominal damage in an accident.<br /><br />~~EASE OF USE~~<br />Because the Vivo is simply a booster, and doesn't even LATCH in, it simply just sits on the vehicle seat.  Therefore, \\"installation\\" is quite easy.<br /><br />The Vivo's headrest is VERY easy to adjust by squeezing a \\"handle\\" on the back of the headrest.  It smoothly moves up and down, making it easy to adjust to the child's height.<br /><br />The belt guides are more than wide enough to easily fit the seatbelt through, but secure enough that the belt doesn't fall out of the guides.<br /><br />Finally, because the sides of the seat are low, it is EASY for the child to buckle him or herself.<br /><br />~~COMFORT~~<br />While I can squeeze myself into some booster seats, I cannot fit in the Vivo, so my report on comfort comes from the child occupants. :)<br /><br />The cover is a soft velour fabric, which is apparently cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  Perfect!<br /><br />The wings are close together, which is great for side-impact protection, but also great for comfortable sleeping (disclaimer:  big kids say the wings are too close together.  They don't seem to like the wings).  Because the high back does recline slightly, kids can rest comfortably in the seat.<br /><br />The seat depth is adequate, so medium-sized kids report that they have enough leg support.  For big kids, though, the seat pan depth is not adequate for leg support.  They report that their legs fall asleep due to the seat pan edge hitting them mid-thigh.<br /><br />~~EASE OF CLEANING~~<br />Thankfully, I've only had to spot clean my Vivo, but it cleans easily and completely.<br /><br />~~CONCERNS~~<br />The high back doesn't adjust to be very high, so this seat is outgrown before most children are ready for a seatbelt alone.  Granted, they can go into a backless booster, so there is an option \\"post-Vivo.\\"<br /><br />The seat pan depth could become a problem.  Soon.  I do wish the Vivo's seat was just a tad deeper.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with the Vivo and do highly recommend it.  Just be prepared that your 7-or-8-year-old might outgrow the seat by height.
B005U6NY0M|5|This item is exact in the photo.. I purchased it to put over our daybed on our porch.. it would almost cover the whole porch its so big.. so if you are looking for a canopy to cover your whole bed & it will definately cover a king no problem... this is the item to buy! Its very pretty & easy to put together & hang.
B0042I2BWG|4|The quality of the cards is great for the price. The cards fit very snugly in the envelopes. The cards themselves are off-white whereas the envelopes are white white. Would be 5 stars if they matched.
B000JJK9EY|5|Many of reviewers complained about mounting to the car seat.<br />Go-GO kidz already improved mounting isssue.<br />For verification, New model number is QRKIDZ and old one is UNIQR.<br />I used two times for air trip. As many reviewers mentioned, you must unmount before passing security check.
B004GVDZEC|4|These diapers fit really well once my baby was about 8 pounds.  So far no leaks.  I gave 4 stars because of price of Grovia diapers.  if the price included an insert, that would be nice but you have to spend an additional $18 to get 2 inserts to go with these diapers.  I have used prefolds in this and it works just as good.
B000ROBLA2|5|Definatly worth the money! My daughter loves this sheet!! I would recommend anyone who has kids to give this a shot!
B000IDSLOG|5|My grandson loves Sophie.  It's a squeaker so if you have a dog that goes crazy when he hears squeaks you might want to keep her only in the car.  :)
B00VQSETAW|5|Just got mine today and my girl is already enjoying it! It's pretty and not over bearing like another one I have. I love the color as it matches my carrier :) definitely may get another one in another color just to have!
B00GSP5CNQ|5|These are great for replacing bulky blankets if you like to swaddle your little one.  And you don't have to worry about them wiggling out because of th velcro closure (one on my laundry enemies).  I recommend washing them with towels so they don't stick to any clothing items, but overall, these are great!
B00EJ6MQRQ|5|Adorable and durable.  Found a hair in my package though haha
B00I8OH8LE|5|Just what I wanted
B000HDKXKM|5|These cups worked out perfectly for our 11-month-old grandson.  He didn't like the sippy cups with handles and was trying to always drink out of an adult cup.  We gave him the red cup (his favorite color), and he immediately was using it.  Lid stays on even when dropped.  Small spout is just the right size.  Good value.  Very pleased.
B002ZG7JTM|4|We chose this mattress because it was the featured item at 50% when we bought my son's crib.  Great price, seems like a nice mattress and good value.
B009WDYQT2|3|The quilt is not soft.
B00VSGIEQM|5|Very comfy and easy to put on
B00HUVLGMS|5|this is a lifesaver for pumping at work! does an amazing job for the price, and is super easy to use.
B003KVWKZO|5|I reviewed other hats but decided on this for the price and the reviews I read. My son gets hot easily and I read some of the other products did not have good ventilation. I was worried because it is all cushion and no hard protection but it works great. The baby keeps it on and it has saved us lots of crying when he bumps his head crawling around.  It came in a cream color with bears on it. It was also a lot cheaper than the other hats.  I have no complaints.
B00BLUCGGE|5|We bought this for our espresso finish crib and the chocolate color blended in well. I attached a few teething toys and my son gnaws on those regularly, in place of the crib rail. Crisis averted thanks to this product! The crib has been saved!
B00KDJ4YXM|5|Its great!  And its mobile! with good sound and view can't ask for more
B00FNJ78V2|5|This is a beautiful crib.  It went together easily.  Feels sturdy and looks beautiful with the crib bedding.  It is for our grand children's visits.
B0096AT0LU|4|Used this set when my son was using the crib/bed. Fit nicely on crib size mattress. Washed and dried well. Soft. When we got him a full size bed we gave the sheets to a friend and kept the comforter. He still uses it as an extra blanket and a playmat with his toy Dinos. Very happy with quality.
B000AV5LZ8|4|Easy to use. Daughter loves to use the &#34;big&#34; potty.
B000JXUJ2M|3|... super expensive for what it is ... I mean how much could 2 metal tubes and some plastic cost ... maybe less than $10?
B000BXHPEU|3|It does not fit most of the toilets I've tried (shopping malls, public library, some restaurants), since they are not round like the seat is apparently designed, but I leave it on anyway... it's better than nothing. My daugher is getting used to it, after six or seven atempts, but I can still see she is not quite confortable.
B00NUGH7HA|1|Looked very cute for pictures. But the packaging was all in Chinese so I had no clue that I should not wash them. Hand wash them or all the stitching comes out. Disappointed that I will not be able to use them more than once!
B00U46546K|5|I received this at a discounted price for an unbiased review - and let me tell you, this is a great product! I was hesitant to get another one, as I had purchased a different car organizer in the past but I just wasn't completely happy with it, it seemed like there wasn't enough space.  This one is so much better! there is so much more room to fit my daughter's books and toys in it.  It also seems very durable.  Very happy with this product!
B000I2Q0F4|4|I could have bought this at Target and saved shipping. It is a good little toy. It looks like it might do more but it does exactly what it looks like. Just for infant exploration, no sounds or pulling things. I think the rings must be for clipping onto strollers or jumpers so they don't fall on the floor
B00FNJ78V2|5|It is a good crib to restart with!
B001OC5UMQ|1|I just received my second gate today in a week and both were bent to the point that they wouldn't close.  Damage is definitely from the manufacturer.  Very dissappointed.
B0038JDV0Q|5|These are the first spoons I purchased for my daughter and they are great. Quality is nice, and color is as expected. The curve is nice because I can feed with the spoon facing forward or sideways. The silicone coating is great for her gums, but also makes a great squeegee for her face! A great buy, you won't be disappointed.
B00ARTRQ0Q|4|Bought 2 pack of these. The washclothes are good quality. But had problem with the pink solid color one. The stitching came apart and it looks nasty now. The designed ones are good.
B005UBCLLU|5|We have had a few car seats, but none of the other ones even compare. My daugter which is 3 years old,sits comfortably, and when she falls asleep, her head does not tilt forward.The seat belt is easy to lock, and it doesn't get tangled! It also doesn't hurt her anywhere (sometimes the other car seat belt would hurt her shoulders). The design is beyond cute - She loves it, and is very very easy to remove and set. As a picky mommy, I highly recommend it...totally worth the money. We are buying a second one.
B004FI5MHO|5|This is a great value. A quick and easily installed way to keep your baby safe.
B008X6RH0E|5|We always run out of spoons for my little girl, so it was great to find a 3-pack of just spoons.  She is 6 years old and these fit her hands & mouth much better than regular size silverware.  Cute design.  Good quality.
B004S027NQ|1|Had to return it because it was too bulky and didn't fold, thus not ideal for travel.
B004ETYJPU|3|I bought this for a birthday present for My son and when I recieved it I was shocked at how small it actually is. Definitely can't use it as a pillow more like a decoration
B00S5MWE4U|5|Love these bibs. Large size, soft fabric, easy to wash and keep clean, and the snap means not only will your baby probably not pull it off, but it won't ruin your other clothes in the laundry like velcro.
B000M278GA|2|Although the songs and the pictures are nice, the toy doesn't have on/off  button. So if you press the happy frog in the middle of the night - there is no way to stop that cheerful song. Also the flaps are kind of hard to open even for adult. And it is still too bulky for my 5 months old. She would love to chew on it but gets frustrated because is the base is too big and it's difficult to get a good grip on the pages.
B00HQMMLP2|5|My little one just began eating solids and eats about two heaping tablespoons. These pods are the perfect size! The food is also very easy to pop out! I made pureed banana and froze it in this and the ice cube trays. I'm having a hard time popping them out of the ice cube trays - but they popped out of this tray with no problem!
B000I2Q0F4|5|My daughter has a few of these toys by Lamaze and she absolutely loves to explore the many textures and sounds that the toys make. This one however is her favorite, she can't get enough of it!
B001F50FFO|5|Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy. No breaks even on hitting concrete multiple times. Beyond happy with this fine product. You won't be sorry. Makes plastic bottle look unsafe for kids.
B0048SOBGO|4|These work great for labeling bottles with flat surfaces and have lasted through months of hand washing every day.  However, they wrinkle funny when put on a rounded surface like my Tommee Tippee bottles.  I would definitely purchase again, but would be more careful about placement.
B008C9W2ZC|5|I love this so much
B0045IBIWM|2|Like the other reviewers, I was drawn to the cute designs and innovative details like the asymmetrical zipper (zips along the bottom, too!) and vents in back  (allows you to check a diaper w/o unzipping).  However, the actual product was very disappointing.  After only a few washes, the seam along the bottom came unraveled, and the printed design began to fade.  The collar is trimmed with a cheap polyester blend material, very rough. I had the same gripes other reviewers noted about the velcro tab--it doesn't stay closed and even when it is closed, you can still feel the rough part of the velcro, which tends to stick to T-shirts and burp cloths.  Also, our 4 month old is now sticking everything in her mouth and I really don't want her to chew on the velcro!  The head and arm holes are bigger than the Halo sleep sack, which makes me worry she will get tangled up, as she's now learning to crawl over and is very active in her sleep. For the same price, I will stick to the Haloes, which we used with our son without any problems at all.  The designs may not be as cute, but the quality is better and they last forever!
B00AJSIVWW|5|My 4 year old girl just loves this seat. Her smile lights right up when she rides in it in the back of daddy's big truck. Would buy again
B001F50FFE|5|i use these along with the 8 oz evenflow bottles. i love glass its so much more healthier then plastic garbage. easy to clean, fits to my medela pump, and easily sterilized in my avent steam sterilizer. great product.
B00OT8WQTW|5|I love this screen protector for my Kindle HD!! It was very easy to put on too!!!
B005S1CWFC|5|very nice product. colorful. i hang on the cabinet easily.  big enough for more v boy.  my boy loves to go restroom now.
B008RXWCT4|5|These are SO cute.  Would make a great baby shower gift or birthday gift for a little monster.  My son LOVES his monster cup.  He has it hold the hands of his monster snack cup.  So cute!
B000NVXBVG|5|My girls love it!  It is so soft and comfy.  I love it because it provides somewhere to store ALL their stuffed animals!!!!
B002QZ64T8|4|When my daughter was an infant, these liners worked perfectly to contain all her poops. We just popped out the liners to rinse those off before putting them in the wash. Now that she's 12 months and 20 pounds, these aren't wide enough to protect her prefolds and we wind up having to scrub those out before washing. If these were just a bit wider, I'd buy a million more because they're cheap, soft and at least used to make our lives easier. Now we're looking for a similar product that will actually span my daughter's entire diaper. But considering that they helped get us through the first ten months or so without scrubbing / rinsing most of her poopy diapers, I'd say that we have very little to complain about.
B00005QI1G|5|Great product! It's easy to put together, sturdy, and fun.  My 6-week old son slept in it when he was fussy and would not sleep anywhere else.  This seat is a &quot;must-have.&quot;
B005QUQC2E|5|Buen juguete, tiene un sonido agradable para los niños, es mas grande de lo que parece. El de cupcake me parece el mejor.
B000G0L2TM|4|Works like a charm.  Sometimes its a bit much to get all the wrapping going and there is a lot of fabric, but it definitely keeps baby contained!
B00JKAYEN0|5|So adorable
B002HMC3HM|5|This is a great affordable changing table.  Most tables with any sort of drawers are much more expensive.  While the drawers are made of canvas, they hold everything I need them to without a problem.  We are short on storage space/drawer space and this has helped out a lot!  We are able to store all diapers, wipes, current clothing, bedding, receiving blankets in this.  It is perfect for what we need it for.
B004184QAW|3|Definitely a flimsy attachment that will eventually break off by accident at some point.  I expect higher quality from Britax
B003FGWA8G|5|There are a lot of great features on this baby monitor:<br />- warning on the parent set if the monitor in the baby's room is turned off<br />- a long range...we can take the parent's set outside.  It will also warn you if you are out of range.<br />- multiple channels<br />etc.<br /><br />But the BEST feature allows you to adjust the sensitivity.  If you want, you can adjust the sensitivity so that the monitor picks up every little sound your baby makes.  If, on the other hand, and you are like me and you want only to hear if your baby starts really crying, you can adjust it for that too.  I credit this monitor (in part) for helping my baby sleep through the night at 9 weeks old and for allowing US to sleep through the night at 9 weeks.  After we moved our son into a different room and started using this monitor, we stopped jumping up at every little sound he makes.  As a result I think he has learned how to put himself back to sleep unless he is really and truly needing us.
B000056OWC|1|My son is 5 months and weighs 22lbs.  When I take my son out of this tub he scraps his legs.  Plus, I am unable to clean his bottom properly in this tub.  Don't waste your money....
B004AHMCLE|3|First off I am going to give this toy a 3 because if I would have paid $7.99 for it I would be very disappointed with it.  When I ordered, I thought that I was getting the pelican but they sent the frog and it appears that you don't have a choice as to which one you want, they just send whichever is available.  Also I think that the quality is flimsy.  I got this on one of Amazon's Black Friday deals, so it was .68 cents and wow it was worth that!  But $7.99 would be too expensive.  Just beware that you don't get to choose which toy you get and also that the quality is not that great.  The legs on the frog are just sewn on felt and I am sure that they wont last too long.  The chime though is really neat, it is very pleasant sounding.  My baby has not been born yet, so I can't say as to what he or she will think of it but I think that it is cute and I intend to hang it on the stroller.  Oh, I should say though that the frog is cute, I just thought that I would be getting the pelican which is more colorful.
B005DS56AS|4|I use this set to pack lunch everyday for my daughter so the nanny knows what and how much to give her and it works perfectly. I had been using the Munchkin Click Lock Bento Mealtime Set but this set is much, much better. Easier to arrange the little containers inside and easier to open and close the containers. I love packing her little lunch in this set.
B0076BNL6Q|5|I had seen this cool line of kids Tee's from a friend on Facebook. I bought 2 Pink Binky Tee's as a gift my friends twins. When they arrived, I was thrilled at the quality of the material and the logo!  My friend absolutely loved them!!! I have heard several times that people were commenting on how cute they were and how unique! I have several little ones in my family and plan on getting one for each of them! What an awesome unique gift!
B003LPUQLY|4|These prefolds are super trim and super absorbant, we have never had a leak. My only issue is that my son is 12 months old and 19lbs, I bought size two and they are barely wide enough to snappi they really have to be either tri folded or folded as thou you are going to use a snappi and then just use the cover to keep in place, I use the thirsties covers. They are still my favourite pre fold due to the trimness and absorbancy.
B003HAXHN2|5|We use these all the time. They work great as diaper inserts. Absorbent and soft.One thing though - we couldn't use them until my baby was 2-3 months old and about 15 pounds as back then  they were too bulky for him. I even decided it was a waste of my money at the time. But as baby grew bigger became our favorite inserts out of all other ones we own.
B008J4FHZ2|5|Love this bottle!!
B001H0GEYI|3|Purchased this seat for my second son and didn't use the back very long. It sits straight up and was very uncomfortable for him to sit in. He was forced to lean forward a little and the back could not be adjusted to lean back at all. We ended up just removing the back, which he was legal height and weight to do. But I purchased this one for the extra security for him incase of a wreck. He had the same issue with falling asleep as other reviewers, either was unable to on long rides, or he fell forward since the seat already made him lean forward a bit anyway! We do like the base without the back for the cup holders on both sides and it has decent cushioning.
B00GQQVNP8|1|Arrived with a hole in them
B00F0X0F5C|5|Easy to install.  The shield takes a little getting used to,  but keeps the poop from flying everywhere.
B00AWLZD54|3|I ordered two of these for each diaper bag and they take up a lot of room.  Definitely not something I'd keep in my bag and have put it away for later use but bought paci pods instead to use b/c you can slip them in a pocket and have them on hand easily.
B0071CT5ZQ|5|This stroller is perfect, it is very light, very easy to use and to navigate. The Nautical stripe theme is very cute.<br />Perfect for tall people as well as smaller people.<br />Comes with the rain cover and an extra pad for the baby in case the weather is a little cooler.
B0042W8ROI|3|Purchased this item for my 7 year old son. He was so excited when we finally received it in the mail. His excitement quickly turned when he noticed the G emblem on the front of the minions overalls was backwards. I would not have noticed, but he is a big fan. Although a little disappointed he still plays with it. Just a caution if that is a deal breaker for anyone.
B00JB2Q2HI|2|This is an okay carrier.<br />The main thing i do not like about it is you can't have the baby facing out from you so they can see.<br />My kids did not like this at all, it would have been better if it had an option to be outward facing.<br />Babys want to see the world around the, not stare in to someone's chest or back.
B000RFCSMQ|4|Love this brush and so easy to store away. Only thing though is that you have to make sure the inside of the larger brush is dry before putting the nipple brush back into it so that mildew or bacteria don't build up.
B0009OLSZ8|5|I love how easy this is to clean.  There are very few grooves for grime to stick.  Also looks great and matches the bathroom.
B000WUF4LS|5|My son loves this booster seat!  The seat is great because it is easy to wipe down as it is all plastic without any hidden areas.  the 3-setting adjustment of the feet allows him to sit at our kitchen table and even put his arms on the table when the tray is off.  The toy keeps him happy while I prepare his meal or just while I eat.  It is a great way to introduce sitting together for a family meal.  We also used it out at a restaurant and it felt much safer for a little baby and helped us have a great time.  I am so glad I went with this rather than a traditional high chair.
B00JK36UY8|5|My 8 month old baby loved this right away! It is soft, snuggly, and suckable. Putting him to bed got so easy!
B007RYU6LA|2|more expensive
B000V4BR4S|1|We bought this Kaboost to replace one we had that broke.  Within 1 week it broke too.  The plastic near the spring in one of the legs broke, which is where the last one broke.  I love the Kaboost, but one week is not very durable for $[...].
B0091WCL5A|5|Beautiful and soft baby headband. Striklingly beautiful rose. Easy to slip on baby's head. Great colors and textures. So pretty.
B00171WXII|5|Just like everyone told me, this works so much more quickly than the bulb syringe.  My baby still hates when I use it but the Frida makes it go by fast.  I was told that it's not as gross as it sounds BUT I still get grossed out when I use it; if you're overly squeamish, you might not want to use this.
B00EV1FGA8|5|This is absolutely ADORABLE! Seeing as now retailers don't include bumpers in infant/crib bedding I was worried I wouldn't find one that would remotely look good with the bedding set I night from target. However, I'm in love.<br /><br />I am also aware more that bumpers come in 4 pieces now. This doesn't cause any problems. If anything, it's easier to put around the crib. Guys tight and snug.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality product, this is it!
B000S8O9ME|5|These removable shower handles work very well. They probably wouldn't be safe to use if you need to put all your weight on them, but for stability in the shower, they work great
B003D7E2XI|4|I bought this pillow to try to force me to sleep on my side. Unfortunately I am a stubborn sleeper! I used to be a stomach sleeper and now wind up waking up flat on my back which is not allowed either! I have to admit I HATED this pillow at first and threw it off the bed for the first week. but I've gotten used to it. I've found it works best to have the long side along my back (rather than hugging it). Also, every time I get up (obviously frequently since I'm pregnant) I come back to my husband laying and cuddling the pillow. After this baby I have a feeling he will steal it ;).
B00029TCJY|1|We ordered this crib, the tower, hutch and 5 drawer dresser on June 15 and only yesterday when I contacted Amazon did they reply and tell me that in an \\"oversight\\" these items are no longer available.  My baby is 2 weeks old today and has been sleeping in her Pack N Play because we anticapted her furniture arriving today or tomorrow as Amazon indicated.  All they gave us for our trouble was a $5 coupon.  I spent most of yesterday trying to find a new furniture suite for my daughter because no one bothered telling me in the past two months that what we had ordered is not available.  Now I'm ending up paying someone else more for express shipping so we don't have to wait for a new order.  And yet, Amazon is still claiming delivery in 5-7 days.
B007PO3RTK|5|This is really an adorable bath time toy. I wanted something that floated on top so baby could swat at it. This does the job just fine! The cute little fishing pole loosely fits into the boat. Baby can detach and use to pick up the fish. Obviously he can't do this at 5 months, but can later down the road, so I think this toy will have a good long life in the bath. The fish do various cute things, like squirt, scoop, and strain water. It's by far his favorite bath toy.<br /><br />I wish the bottom part did not detach, but all-in-all, a safe and reliable bath toy that baby will love for a long time.
B000056OV3|2|Being a first time mom I got exited and registered for alot of things.  Diaper Genie shouldn't have been on my list!!!It really doesn't make it easy, I rather use a regular trash can!!! Overall I wouldn't spend money on it.
B0009RNXNK|5|Great cooler bag! I don't use it much for bottles, however I do use it almost daily for bringing my lunches to work.
B000MVVWFE|2|I bought this to attach to my diaper bag so that I could have my son's pacifier easily accessible and clean. It fits about two pacifiers. The problem is that when I snap the black strap together the pop comes undone with the slightest tug. I was worried that it would fall off with just the tossing around of my diaper bag. So I glue gunned it together around the strap of my diaper bag and when I don't need it anymore I'll have to cut the Pocket's black strap and trash it. I wouldn't buy this again. Next time I would go to the store and test the pop attachment before buying.
B005WG2852|5|Excelent
B001F50FFO|4|Bottles have worked well since we bought them 6 months ago.  Solid construction, no worries about breakage, but the trade-off is that these bottles are a little heavier.
B000056HLT|2|Works okay as long as you don't put it in the drier because it will shrink.  Mattress covers are hard enough to get on without having to struggle with one that is too small!
B0033CZ214|1|It came broken, I had to return it.
B00006RVHQ|1|My daughter is 6 months old and can hold herself up pretty well.  At dinner the other night she pulled herself forward and down at the same time.  She hit her head on the side rail.  How, you ask if she is buckled in.  The problem lies with the 3 point harness.  There is nothing holding her sholders back.  I'm returning this one and getting another high chair with a 5 point harness ASAP.
B00005C5H4|5|My daughter loves these!  She's currently 6 months old, but really got into them towards the end of 4 months.
B00007IT4Y|1|Because that is what it deserves!!!<br />My husband has put together many items (crib, dresser, armoire, etc.) and it took him over two hours to put this together.  Once it was done, he told me not to really use it until he put some tie wraps around where the two pieces meet.  OK, that's not a good sign.  I tried to pull up the lever, couldn't do it with one had and definately not with my left so I tried it with two hands.  It was hard and very painful but I did it.<br />Now, the fact that I can't carry my baby up the stairs and open the gate is a huge problem.  My husband said that there is no way to use the gate in that fashion and that I can only use the gate if I'm already upstairs and I wanted to keep our daughter safe.  Upon reading all the other reviews, it worries me that she may fall down the stairs.<br />I'm sure that my husband did not read the directions incorrectly as he is not missing parts.  He did complain about the diffulty in understanding them though.<br />We're taking it back.  I feel terrible after my husband spent so much time on it but the safety is first, easy of use is second and usability is third. <br />Heed our warnings - DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  40+ of us can't all be wrong about this product.
B00000ITF7|5|We bought this for our daughter shortly after her 1st birthday. She loves Elmo and loves playing in my purse, therefore we thought she would enjoy this toy. She does- she loves putting the items in and out of the purse and pretending to use the phone and put on the lipstick. The only complaint I would have is that all of the items barely fit into the purse.  My daughter can never get them all in - it's like a puzzle. However, she still enjoys playing with it. I recommend this toy.
B0049H9X7Q|5|I love this mat!  Great for music or to carry with you when you know you will be in a place that needs a clean place for your baby to play.  Its the perfect size and GREAT quality!   LOVE!
B00264YZNG|5|It was sweet and I like the protector that was over the nipple had never seen one.  It is for my first grandbaby!
B003NQTQRQ|3|I like these but they aren't anything too special.  They are soft but I wish they were a bit bigger and more substantial.
B005O55LN2|5|I looked around for a good changing mat for our changing table for a long time. I found a lot of the traditional style ones that were super cheap, but when I saw this one, I had to have it. I love the shape of it with the thick, soft round edges. It's also a nice size -- there is plenty of space for my daughter even with her \\"chicken legs\\" flailing around. I LOVE the thick, tall sides too. They are much more substantial than any other mat I found and I love that. One feature that I don't think is really shown here is that there is a strip of velcro across the top so the towel sticks to it and stays in place. Sounds kind of strange, but it works. It also helps keep my daughter in place. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the velcro strap that goes across her too. I hate those thin, awful buckles made of cheap plastic that you have to squeeze to release. The velcro strap also means you don't have to spend a bunch of time adjusting a strap to fit - just velcro it looser or tighter. The inside of the velcro strap is the same terry cloth material as the towel. The towel is a nice addition, but this would still be well worth the price without it.<br /><br />Buy this changing pad! You'll thank me when it's 3am and you're not fussing with nylon straps and plastic buckles and a changing mat that barely fits your kid! This saved me!
B002BSGXFA|1|Receive it on bad conditions!!! Very dissapointed :-(
B008U5PL8I|3|The crib liner serves the general purpose it was purchased for but the design is less than perfect. The panels are not sized well enough and the way it has to be secured to stay in place at the end is less than desirable. Also the liner was made for a crib that doesn't have a mattress support that secures to the legs of the crib. This makes the liner bunch up at the corners.
B00FPDAVYC|4|These protectors seem to be good quality and fit the iPad fairly well. I did have a very small overhang on the edge - about 1/32 of an inch. This is pretty typical of these bargain protectors. I tested the fit before I applied the protector so I know that it wasn't from crooked placement. My keyboard case would catch on the film and pop the screen protector up. Between that issue and trying to get rid of bubbles, I went through all three protectors within a few days.<br /><br />These were tougher to apply compared to a phone for obvious reasons (size). I kept getting bubbles and/or a bit of overhang. For the third attempt, I grabbed a cordless vacuum and turned it on as I applied the protector. I pushed out the bubbles with some extra force before I removed the second film. Had to trim the edge so it wouldn't catch on the keyboard case.<br /><br />I do not have to wipe the screen very often - but don't take that to mean that finger marks don't show up. They do. But this screen has a decent ability to mask stray marks while in use.
B00000IW2S|4|I had one of these shape sorters when I was a kid and totally loved it.  So when I saw one of these at a garage sale I snatched it up for my daughter, who was then 1 1/2.  I must say that when she was that young, putting the shapes in the right holes was a bit too challenging for her, although she did enjoy taking the blocks in and out of the box by way of the lid.  By the time my daughter was 2 she was getting really good at finding the right shapes for the holes and really enjoys playing with it.  I have one of the older, sturdier shape sorters since I bought it used, and haven't had any trouble with the lid coming off.  I would say that overall this is a great toy for teaching shapes and orientation.  There are hours of use in this toy!
B00W9OSTNU|5|Emma loves this. Super soft, sturdy. Gives her something to chew on instead of my gold necklace. Also distracts her during diaper change.
B003KTLYGM|5|Very durable material. Velcro snaps make it easy to install.<br /><br />Cons: if you put a water bottle in the console when running it wobbles slightly and is not as sturdy as I had hoped. But it still does the job.
B00HWGOVDM|4|I gotta be honest here, I expected it to be big, But its more of a baby blanket. I still love it though!! Its very soft & warm for cold winter days. ^-^
B002D76GX8|5|Our 10 month old has been chewing on the inside of his crib after naps, we just found out! these crib rails have been the perfect solution. he can chew them and not hurt himself or the crib. we ordered the side crib rails and the crib rail cover, so the covering goes all the way around.
B0030E9VL2|5|I would recommend to a friend.  As grandparents it is convenient to have it fold up for storage or to move about the house.
B00OJOB6UQ|5|Love this toy organizer! Delivered quick after purchase.
B002HJXHI4|5|First of all, the bedding arrived two days after I purchased it. Unbelievable!  Second of all, it is the most beautiful thing I've seen in a long time.  The quality is exquisite!  I'm so in love with this set.
B000U0R5D0|2|I had quads and needed 4 of these mattresses. I have already had to replace ALL of them AND now one of the replacements that I bought less than 2 months ago needs replaced. The babies are now 20 months old. My older children had standard mattresses. They used those until they were 4 and moved to full size beds after toddler beds. I'm shocked. These should really only get 2 stars. I feel stuck with buying these since I have mini cribs and I don't want to buy other cribs, and the babies will be in toddler beds before long. They are not really warranted. Only Amazon provides a warranty. Be aware!
B00008KWO1|5|We own the newborn swaddling type, the cotton and the microfleece and love them all.  Very much like not having to bundle baby in blankets they can kick or wiggle out of!  We keep our home cool (62-65) year-round and these help keep babies comfy and safe all night long.  One of our new mommy diaper bags with all the promo stuff in it had one of these in a microfleece style!  From newborn thru crawling, these are great and now they make them with feet for older kids.  Kudos Halo!!  We tell everyone about these and give them as baby shower gifts.  Have seen other brands but we've stuck with Halo as they've held up through multiple washings w/o fail!!  Baby #2 is wearing baby #1's Halo's and they are still going strong and will be donated to a Goodwill as they still look that good!
B001GQ2RWQ|5|needed a high chair for my grandchild but found this instead.  love it!  it is portable and  fits in any chair with a back.
B005QU55EA|5|keeping my two years old and one year old boys out of my cabinets. yayy!
B00KZ1GXCI|5|cute
B001PBFWLK|5|I have no complaints about this monitor, I love it. I love the motion sensor.. I'm a first time mommy and I used to worry so much in the beginning about irrational things like \\"what if she just stops breathing?\\".. this monitor works like a charm and it really really helps me with my peace of mind at night. it was worth every penny.
B00003TL3H|3|This busy bug is a wonderful idea. It also keeps my baby busy while we are out and about and he is in his stroller for a long time.  The only problem I find with the busy bar, is that it does not stand up completely while it is straped to the bar of the stroller.  I am always picking it up so that my baby can play with it.  I think it depends on the style stroller you have.  My friend has the same busy bar, and it works just fine for her and always stays up. I would recommend it, even though I am always fixing it, my son enjoys it very much, especially to teethe on!
B0017S2S86|1|As soon as we opened this mattress, there was a small piece of paper which had a Prop 65 warning: &#34;there may exist trace amounts of chemicals in this product know to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.&#34; I am returning this mattress and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT. Who wants to have their kids sleep on something like this? I think it's very deceptive for the sellers here not to list it on the Amazon product listing page, even though Amazon requires you to do so. DO NOT BUY THIS MATTRESS.
B006MW2WYC|5|I purchased this stroller for my daughter and her baby!! It's a great stroller! Beautiful and lightweight!<br />It's a well made stroller and one that will be used often. Thank you.
B0052QYLUM|4|I agree with all comments with good things about this product, I totally recommend, but for me there's a problem with interference in my wi-fi network. The performance dropped significantly and sometimes the network is totally lost! I think this device works on the same frequency of my wifi network causing going down
B000G7YO7M|5|We bought this for our son as it gets really cold in Chicago.  The toddler size fits our son perfect and he has fallen asleep in it on more than one occassion as he ges snuggled in toasty warm.  It fit our Chicco stroller with no troubles. A+
B001CWSVWO|5|This is the best crib sheet I've bought and I can't believe the price. I should have purchased 2 at once! It is the perfect size a bit oversized and secure so you don't have to worry about it popping off in the middle of the night. I love this sheet!
B0009RG8R8|4|Works great keeping my 13 month old contained. We have a big play room and after 15 minutes after installing He doesn't even mess with it any more.  Other reviewers complained of children figuring out the gate latch.  I can't see a child under 2.5 doing it. The hinges could be made of a stronger material than plastic, but I haven't had a problem in it's first 3 months.
B00EOML70W|5|Great product if you like organic
B003KEMMNG|5|The bumpers arrived 2 days after ordering, very impressive to the point I didn't mind anymore having paid a shipping fee!  The bumpers work great. They come in two 2-foot lengths, which we installed side-by-side under the sheets. After 3 nights, no tumbling out of bed. Our daughter is very happy, and so are we!
B001IAEMPA|5|works well and good price
B001U300I8|1|There is no minus stars!!  Just don't buy it, it's a waste of time and money!  We bought the biggest shield as the circumference of our table was exactly in the middle range of the larger size, and the cushions is so bulky and useless. It doesn't go nicely around the edge as is shown on the picture, except in the corners of the table, but on the four sides just stands without wrapping the edge.  On top of a bad product you have to:  1. PAY THE SHIPPING BACK  2. PAY RE-STOCKING FEES  3. ADDITIONAL CHARGES FROM THIS AND THAT  ....BUT FINALLY YOU GET RID OF THE ANNOYING BOX  .......TRUST ME JUST DON'T BUY THIS THING!!!
B000EIGJQ2|4|No problems with this gate, worked as expected.  Nothing stood out about it, but good value for the money and I like that it has the side extensions so I can put it in more than one place.
B001LVW8DE|5|The doll the is beautiful and the stitching looks hand sewn. The materials used to make the bed itself actually seems to be as sturdy as the one I sleep on. The many different mattress's are well made and vary in color, pattern etc. The little blanket is well made.<br />I actually received this gift as a Christmas gift 2 years ago Christmas 2011. I am an adult and begged my mom for it. I acted as if I were 5 again. I love this and have purchased other products made by the same company. I have never been disappointed. As others have said. It is a on the expensive side. However, you get what you pay for. I would prefer to pay for a high quality item than own a bunch of junk. I think the book is ok. I didn't purchase this for the book. I hope the company maintains their quality rather than to lower the quality and sell it at mass market discount stores.
B00HZ8JEKC|4|Very well may need backpack, my son loves it!
B00EM5CLUQ|5|When my baby wouldn't take the nuk or soothies I thought he wouldn't take pacifiers at all, but he loves MAM!
B00LHC950G|5|This was perfect for lighting at the top of a set of stairs. Not too bright but enough light to see where you are going.  Very cute and seemed well made and very easily turned on with a toggle switch.  Delivery was very fast and it arrived well packaged.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B000M4XVDW|5|Such a smooth ride for baby and so easy to maneuver. Has no problem going from rugged trails to cramped grocery store aisles. Really love the BOB! I have the infant seat adapter which I use with a Chicco Key Fit and it works great. I love that the BOB canopy covers the infant car-seat so baby is protected from the wind, I feel that the she is also very secure in there. We live in SF and it's great on all terrain (dirt, sand, city sidewalks with pot holes) especially a breeze going up curbs that are not \\"wheel\\" friendly yet.   Only drawback and it's not a big problem because we seldom take it in the car.. but it's huge when folded. We have to take the wheels off to get it into our corolla.. it fits but its a slow process getting it in and out...BUT if you live in walking distance from trails and or shopping destinations like we do its awesome!
B0047RI5YU|1|I started out really liking this warmer, minus the fact that it has no auto-shut off which i was willing to overlook. However, i have now been using the warmer for about 5 months and it has gone completely haywire! It is BOILING the water...like seriously big bubbles, overflowing that are boiling hot...I called customer service thinking they would of course replace the warmer because it is obviously defective. I mean what baby company would be ok with their product getting to so hot to the point of boiling, right? Yeah, they didn't really care and told me i would have to send the warmer in to them, at MY EXPENSE and they would investigate it, if they found it faulty then they would possibly send me a new one, which by the way could take anywhere from 6-10 weeks! i could not believe it, and what am i supposed to do for 6-10 weeks waiting to see if they deemed it faulty...i was basically told that was my problem.<br /><br />i'm sorry but there are sooooo many other baby companies out there that have amazing customer service and would not hesitate to make it right when their product was defective...Shame on you Tommee Tippee, what ever happened to standing behind your product.
B008J3UD4S|4|For the price, this is a great product. There were no instructions for how to attach it to the stroller, and even though it is described as folding into a small pouch there are no instructions for that either. I still haven't figured out how to do that, but I can fold it small enough to sit in the basket of the stroller when folded up. I've figured out how to attach it to the stroller and it is really easy- you just wrap it around one of the bars of the stroller and the velcro sticks to itself. We don't actually use the back straps, as the back of the cover hugs the back of the stroller just fine. I like that we can pull it down all the way over the stroller for when the sun is right over us (living in Florida, it is essential to cover from the sun). The product did come slightly damaged- several strings were hanging off that I had to cut. Otherwise, I like it fine.
B0001ZZQS0|5|I purchased this carseat when my daughter was 9 months old and outgrew her infant seat. I shopped around and it came down to two Britax products, the other being the Britax Marathon. I chose the Roundabout because although I have an SUV, the Marathon just seemed too large and bulky. I am so glad I chose the Roundabout; it is the perfect size for a mid-size SUV and my daughter has plenty of room to grow (she is now 15 mo.). The cover is easy to remove and washes really well without it wearing and the seatbelt is easy to work with (the velcro straps on the cover makes it easy to keep straps out of the way and untwisted). <br /> <br />The biggest plus is the high safety ratings on this seat. You can never put a price on that. Well worth it!!
B004LLBR6A|5|I have had these in my son's room for 2 years and they are still stuck tightly to the wall. Very well made and was a great alternative to painting the nursery. They matched well with our theme and are good sized.<br /><br />The tree was a bit difficult to assemble but it really varies on how much you want it to look exactly like the picture and wether you are a perfectionist or not. Each leaf is done one at a time, leaves on the vine, tail on monkeys, etc. Easy to do but can take some time depending on how much attention to detail you spend. Totally worth it to me and looks so amazing, fun to do!
B000WIBFCC|1|Bought this when my son was a newborn to relieve his congestion.  The tank is prone to leak if it is not on exactly right, and I started laying it on top of a towel to catch the drips.  Even the quiet setting is very loud, which he likes as white noise, but could be a bother for others.  The filters need to be changed very frequently, which quickly adds up.  I could accept all this if the product worked well, but very little of the water is evaporating, and it doesn't seem to help with the congestion at all.  Save your money and buy a warm mist humidifier just being sure to keep it out of reach of the kids.
B00UCU6R7S|4|Not as great of quality as it seems in the listing, but still cute and rustic. It looks nice in my baby's woodland-themed nursery.
B0016IZ2DK|5|Very easy to make cleaning products with my new jug of soap!
B0047O3Y30|5|I love this booster!! I was so nervous about moving from a 5 pt harness to a booster and it was really important that the booster had latch for added safety this seat has it all! It even has a strap for inbetween their legs to prevent them from sliding under the seat belt in an accident. My daughter is very tall and the height of this seat is fantastic!! I'm sold on everything britax and actually changed my younger daughter's seat to britax as well.
B000LP81H8|5|After trying out the Fisher-Price Rainforest swing, we thought our little baby boy was just not a \\"swinging\\" baby.  Well, that all changed after we tried out this swing.<br /><br />We've used it for about 2 weeks now, about 1-3hrs a day, and the batteries are still working great even at the highest speed with the music on.  Our \\"little boy\\" is almost 19lbs at 4 months, but this swing has no problem keeping up the momentum.<br /><br />The music is actually not that bad and although the nature sounds loop every 3 seconds, it seemed to calm him when he was being a bit fussy the other night, so if scratchy \\"water\\" sounds are going to put him to sleep, I'm not going to question it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this swing, especially if your baby is a bit above average like ours.  =)
B00F1LRN08|4|I am quite pleased with this item. It is almost perfect. The napper/changer is difficult to remove and reattach. It's beautiful and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00Q2VJPNY|4|Its beautiful but smaller than expected.
B001QT7U8Y|4|I was specifically looking for an alphabet design that would have a picture associated with the majority, if not all letters in the alphabet. Other alphabet designs take shortcuts with just a few pictures. I wanted to do this for my second child because my older child also has an alphabet design with a picture of an animal for almost all the letters and showed an avid interest in going over the pictures, learning new words and letters early on. I;ve even caught her quietly repeating the names of the animals to herself before falling asleep!    having met my first requirement, this is also a very cute design with a modern touch. What has been disappointing:    - I expected all cotton materials but both the blanket and the bumper have a fluffy, all polyester back. this was not apparent from the picture or the description.  - bumper ties are too short and a struggle to tie in the back and the 4 corners of a sleigh-type crib  - bumper ties are not in the right places if your crib has a solid panel in the center of the long side of the crib. I have tried to remove them and re-sew them in more usable locations along the bumper but there really needs to be more ties attached in the first place  - the sheet fits but the dots are just too much and too dense - it's a very busy pattern   - you cannot buy spare sheets and it is hard to match the color/pattern with another brand - important in a baby set given that you can have a variety of accidents
B000LSL5ZK|5|These spoons are fantastic.  The tips bend and are soft, which really helps when scraping yogurt and purees out of a dish (much like a silicone spatula when baking), but the spoons hold their shape very well.  They are comfortable to hold and, very important, hold a reasonable amount of food, whether the food is runny or more solid.  My husband is actually the one who requested I buy more of these and get rid of the Gerber spoons we had - he hated those.
B000L9HN00|5|We were so happy to find this on amazon as a backup for my son. He loved the first one someone got for him so much we needed a backup for when it was in the wash!
B007NG5UF4|3|This monitor sounds great, no horrible static like the last one, [[ASIN:B004Y6USAI Sony 900 MHz BabyCall Sound-Sensor Nursery Monitor (Baby Call)]], we used with our son. We live in a 3-story townhouse. The baby end unit is on the second floor and I take the parent unit everywhere in the house and in the yard with no problems.<br /><br />The talk back feature is great when I'm communicating with my husband or singing to the baby while I'm making a bottle downstairs.<br /><br />We keep it plugged in overnight and sporadically during the day and haven't had too many issues with it needing to be recharged.<br /><br />I would have given this a 5-star rating but the screen no longer works. We've been using it for 5 1/2 months now and it probably started to disappear 6 weeks ago. This renders the menu button unusable. I included a picture of whats left.<br /><br />But even with the malfunctioning screen I would recommend the monitor for how clear it sounds. If there ever is a next time, I think I'll buy the set with 2 parent units.
B000GAYYCE|5|great product
B00IR4F47A|5|We purchased the Lil Gems version.  Our 3 mth old daughter loves this!  It's easy to fold up and clean.  The toys are great and can be used in a number of ways.  Highly recommend.
B006GCAMG8|2|Not sure if we got 4 defective spouts, but every single one of them (we ordered 4) caves in when our twins drink their bottles. We have to unscrew the top to allow air in to get fluid to come out - we have even tried to poke the air vent with something sharp to help. We have been using Nuk sippy spouts for months now and these are the only 4 that we are having issues with.
B00GY8J1A2|1|They are cute, but small. I only recommend for use on infants or babies under 15lbs. The neck is too tight for my big boy.
B00317E3HA|1|Everyone kept raving about the Ergo so I went a head and got one with the infant insert.  I cannot get this thing on properly.  It takes an experienced playground mom to get it adjusted properly and I can't get the clip in the back of the shoulders clipped without assistance.  I find it hot, and my newborn is not real fond of the newborn insert.  Maybe when she gets older I will be able to use this, but for now, I wish I had saved my money or tried it first.
B0019LOJ8I|5|Works great. No leaks. Durable. Does take some effort to put together but it is built well and takes a beating.
B002UD6C16|1|I hate the smell waste of money no directions on this. Not sure if i should just use to clean the area or if it was a diaper ointment substitute.
B0042PZC70|5|Awesome product, Awesome savings
B001OC5UMQ|4|We bought this gate to keep our puppies from having the run of the house.  Works great.  Easy to install, easy to open and close.
B004CJ9D6W|3|Thee are a lot of things to like about this baby monitor.  The night vision works very well.  The picture clarity is excellent.  There was very little feedback noise on this unit.  However, after a few months, I have decided that this unit will be returned.  The battery life of our unit is very poor.  We can't even get two hours of time off the charger in VOX mode.  This just was not enough for us.  However, if you can keep the monitor mostly on its charging base, then this should work well for you.
B002UD6C2K|3|These wipes are very thick, which is good for cleaning off big poopy messes.  However, they are too thick to get into little crevices, especially when you fold them.  Folded twice, they are almost half an inch thick!  My baby girl doesn't like it when I use these in certain areas.  I plan to get some thinner flannel wipes to use alongside these.  Also, some of the thread is coming off around the edge.
B00005BTNA|5|I just wanted to assure anyone debating on these bottles that they are great.  With my 1st child I used the regular vent air when they 1st came out and I loved them so using them again was a natural choice for me however I did change to the natural shape. My new baby had trouble latching on to regular nipples at the hospital however once we came home and he used the natural shape vent air and his troubles were gone.  I did also buy the regular vent air for travel purposes since the bottles are smaller however the stage 1 nipples that they came with do not let enough milk out he sucked for about an hour barely getting 2 ounces out and I did follow all the directions even tried repearcing the nipples with a needle.  They only work with the stage 2 niples which may have too much flow for a newborn.  I had no problems with the natural shape nor have I had any problems with leaks from the bottom just make sure to tighten it well.  I give these bottles 5 stars the 2nd time around.
B00PTL86UG|5|These bowls are great not just for me but also for my child.  It allows my child the independence to know when they can eat. The bowls are strong and easy clean up
B003FGWA8G|5|I just want to let parents know that if they want to sleep with no interfering sound, do not hesitate, this is your best shot. It activates with movement, so while your baby is not moving you would not hear a sound. And when your baby needs you, it is crystal clear. It is truly the best!
B00O9K8NV0|5|This is a tiny change purse that I use for all of my various cards that I carry in my purse. It would work well for dress purses where you just want to take I.D., a little money and a credit card. It has a very strong smell initially but after airing for a few days, the smell diminishes greatly. It takes a little while to arrive (10 days) because it is shipped directly from China. If you have the time to wait for it to arrive and air out, you can't beat it for its utility and price.
B00B1M2NTM|5|Love it!
B00A9HX8TE|4|Bought them for my grand daughters - they were a hit.  have to use them inside because it's so cold.  for the limited space - they work great - cannot wait to get them outside to see how they really like them.
B00KHJXEHK|5|Purchased for 12 hour school days when I had to take breakfast, lunch and dinner along. I could fit everything with ease in here, including multiple, stacked glass pyrex containers of all sizes.... round, square, rectangular, 20 oz. water, a pint Mason jar, couple hard boiled eggs and other baggy items. I always kept it in the fridge at school so I can't speak as to how well things stay insulated. But if it's room you need, this will do it! Perfect height, width and depth. Folds up to store away, but a little bulky.
B003C1Q1ZW|5|they screamed with joy they all opened them together! it was the best christmases for me and nana to watch the grandchildren.
B0071CQIJW|4|The Born Free sippy cups are the only sippy cups that I have ever used for my sons and I am very happy with them! We are not huge sippy cup people but it is nice to have a couple around! It was very important to me to use a sippy cup that was made of the safest materials and te Born Free brand fit the bill! These cups are sturdy and have held up well to use! We personally do no use the handle piece; it doesn't seem necessary to me. My favorite part of these sippy cups is that the nipple part is soft and flexible like a bottle nipple. A lot of sippy cups have hard sipping parts and it seems horrible for a baby's teeth to me! These cups are inexpensive and they are my favorite sippy cups on the market right now!
B002LARFR8|5|I purchased these wash cloths to be used as cloth wipes since we are also cloth diapering my little one. These work just as I need them too. They are a little on the thin side so I would not want to actually use them as a washcloth for my baby. However, they are the perfect thickness and size for wipes! I fold these accordion-style and place them in a wipes holder. This way, they pull out one at a time, just like disposable wipes, but are completely washable and eco-friendly!
B005LAJEWO|5|We had some serious problems with other crib sheets--several of them were too short (lengthwise) on the mattress.  Two of the sheets I have are so tight that they make the mattress curl up!  That's obviously no good for lots of reasons.  I ordered two of the American Baby jersey sheets because they seemed like they'd be more forgiving than a typical percale sheet...and I love them!  The color is great, the fit is awesome, and they are super soft.<br /><br />These sheets are going on my list of must-have gifts for parents-to-be.  Highly recommend!
B003LQQNQK|5|My grand baby loves his turtle. I tested it before sending it to him for Christmas. And it was the perfect item for him.
B00HI0Y0I8|3|Color attracts my baby well but the 90% of the mirror distorts her image. Very bottom of the mirror is ok though.
B00081J3OU|5|High quality product. Thick plastic. Baby cannot slide the plastic cover over, but much easier for an adult to slide than trying to pull out those annoying plastic plug-in covers that then become a choking hazard.<br /><br />You don't need one of these on every single outlet, but if you have a place in your home where you will be plugging things in and out on a regular basis, this is great. My husband plugs in his laptop and works at the kitchen table - so we have one of these on the outlet by the table, which is a perfect example.
B002VWZU7S|5|Mu granddaughter (7 months) goes nowhere without her Lamaze toys. I bought this for Christmas and she just loves it.
B0096MLL06|5|These keep the changer surface clean and are nice and soft for baby. I machine wash and dry them and they've held up well. My only complaint is they are a little short for the changer on our day 2 night sleep system pack n play.
B002TOKHJE|5|nice,reaLLY GOOD quality product,buy it,, my relative will be so excited.......to get this as a gift ...really awesome ,wonderful<br />Awesome
B001OW6SAE|4|I got this product since I was looking for something small, compact, nice and less expensive. At first I was surprised at the weight (very light) but later on after assembling, I realized that its a cool crib and believe my baby will like it so much when he arrives.
B000PJ59NE|4|My wife wanted this so we got it.  It is a pricey bed.  It looks good but I don't know if that justifies the price.  Functionality wise, it works well.  My son loves it.  But it is a bit high off the ground and he has fallen off once when he stood up.  Now we have a king size pillow on the head part and it is working fine.  He still bangs his head because he spins around so we put blankets on the side.  All in all I like it better than our Stokke crib since it's bigger but don't know if this is that much better than any regular cheaper toddler bed.
B004BSFOJY|5|We actually already own 1 of these, but my daughter loves it so much, we needed a back up. Little taggies all over the puppy was a great idea
B00CWN8IK2|5|Heating with a woodstove is great exercise and heat.  But it can mean really, really dry air.  To combat this, I have several humidifiers going 24/7 throughout the house.  This is my first ultrasonic humidifier.  And I love it.  It's quiet, can really put out the moisture, and doesn't use those awful filter/wick elements that a lot of humidifiers do.<br /><br />Like all humidifiers, you're going to want to keep it clean.  And keep an eye on the tank (which in this case is border-line too small IMHO).  Otherwise, there's little to worry about with this - it just works.
B0029F1O2M|5|After a lot of research, it was obvious that this breast pump is the best manual breast pump on the market. It holds a simple technology that only this pump has.   It's fast, efficient, and extremely cost effective at one of the lowest priced pumps available. First Years is a great brand, and on top of that they add the extras of to 5 oz bottles with two sealing caps to store breast milk, which by the way, does not leak. :)) Don't waste your time or money on other breast pumps; this is the one for you!!!
B005GAVG5W|5|When I had my son the hospital did not give me a diaper bag so I needed to buy one. I have been using this bag daily for three months and there has been no wear and tear. It is large enough to fit many items. The price is great too.
B006ZL22PY|5|Really great. We use it for parks, beach , pool, tummy time at grandmas, etc. easy to clean material and thick enough so you won't feel everything under you but thin enough to move around with ease.
B004YGL65E|5|Works very well for my grandson, he fits in it well and it will grow with him.
B006Z6D61I|2|Good until the rust started coming out the bottom. It is perfect for holding the family's toothbrushes and toothpaste. I love being able to take it apart to clean it. Unfortunately whatever they used inside of it to weigh it down has gotten rusty and is now staining my sink. Now I'm looking to relace it. Waste of money.
B0090OM1F4|5|They are sooooo cute and these bows go with every outfit! Do you also make a larger size, these ones are great for newborns, but I could see a toddler using a larger set.
B000AV5LZ8|5|Our kids have loved this seat! It doesn't wabble so they feel secure, and saves me from having to clean a potty seat all the time. great purchase!
B00020L78M|4|I bought two superyards as a pet barrier for a new puppy.  It assembles and disassembles very easily, keeps the pup safe (and our house from the pup). Not sure the puppy likes it as much as we do, but once we're through the house-breaking she won't care.
B002QYW8LW|2|Not safe for teething babies. The bristles start coming off once they start biting on it. Wasn't too happy with it.
B000XBPSZI|1|this lovie is very small, scratchy and it has a hard lump in the middle of it. Also, the face on mine did not match the picture. The face on the one I received was rather scary and unattractive (the kitty had an angry frown on his face). The material is not soft either. I was very unimpressed and will not be buying anything from this brand again.
B00QFVVN7M|5|Love these bibs!  So soft and cute!  Perfect for a teething baby and for starting solid foods!
B009IW2HMA|1|haha.......I couldn't use even once, the blender doesn't fit with jar. no useful for me.
B0038JE5Y2|5|I love these trays.  The lids are great for stacking, they don't completely seal but I transfer the food to ziplock freezer bags once frozen.  I love that they are a little bit of smaller size (3/4 oz) and bpa free.
B007UDKKM8|5|I rated this as a five star product because I absolutely love it. We placed it above our newborns crib (which is white) and my husband did a fantastic job putting it together. You can follow the picture on the package, which is what I think my husband did. Give it a try, I would recommend this to a friend.
B00MLYK0OY|5|thanks perfect
B000YDDF6O|5|I bought this for my grandson who is 4mos. old. He loves it. The music is the right volume and he loves to see the changing. lights.
B00139Q4P2|5|My daughter has had this bear since she was born. She is almost 6yrs old and still sleeps with him every night. We actually bought 2 in case we ever lost one but she always knew the difference. Bear #1 and Bear #2 we call them
B000VZC4O4|5|I bought this for my daughter, and she could not live without it.  Makes it so easy to be close to newborn, with hands free to care for a 21 month old.
B001TY6O8I|1|It's comparable to low density foam. Also, it came to me ripped and had to send it back.
B000JKPZVK|1|This product is shoddy to say the least. It's the only thing I've ever bought that wasn't worth the time and effort to even put together. The screws don't line up with the holes, there are no pre-drilled holes in the wooden dowel rods and the cloth material of the cart is of extremely poor quality-paper-like. There was also ink on the material that smeared when touched. After an hour of fighting this thing during assembly I chucked it all. Actual carpenter skills and tools should not be required to assemble something like this.    I've never seen such a poor quality product. I would rate it at less than a star if possible.
B00LZKBUT4|4|this works as promised but my baby hates riding in the ergo. I keep hoping my baby will change his mind and I don't think it is due to any defect with the product. It is a bit of a pain to strap him in, especially if we are going from the car and I don't have a convenient place to lay him down and get him situated. I would rather have a carrier that doesn't require an insert. I understand they are out there but I had already bought the ergo.
B006G94D0C|5|This Mattress Is so firm yest luxuriously soft at the same time  make sure you do rush or expedited shipping because USPS tends to deliver damaged products that are over a certain weight I paid expedited and i came right on time I am completely content with my purchase
B00OPEJ738|2|see-through
B00ESXTNQ2|1|I was not happy i thought i was getting a pack of gel teether's not just one the picture showes a pack of 5 thats bad advertising
B004NWKKTM|3|Not as durable as I thought it would be.  A bit on the flimsy side, especially when you unfold the stroller and lock into place with your foot.  I'm always careful about that as it feels that it will break if I put too much force into locking the stroller.  Be careful when you stand stand the stroller up in folded position.  It does not stand very sturdy as the stroller will be top heavy with the wheels.  All it takes is a slight breeze and it will topple over.
B00INYJ6U0|5|Very cute. Well made product. Arrived quickly and good price!
B000M9QNQY|5|We were headed to the cabin, baby going to nap outside in her pack n play...and I thought I should buy this just in case. Man, it sure was a lifesaver!  Fit easily on the Graco playpen, very easy to put on and off.  Durable (I caught my wedding ring on it more than once, and it didn't rip at all).  Nice tight mesh so none of the various bugs could get in.  Great price and fit a great need!!
B0016JH9SU|4|bought for my granddaughter who is 2 1/2 she is a little young but working on the concept.
B00083HK0M|3|I LOVE that is has a foot pedal. And it keeps odors in REALLY well. It is just slightly too small because it only holds one load of cloth diapers (about 11 cloth diapers) so I have to do a load about every day, even though I have enough cloth diapers to do one every other day, I can't because I have nowhere to put them.<br /><br />When we were using disposable we seemed to fill it up in about 2 days, so...yeah. I wish it was a little bigger. If I had a laundry room, I may have considered just buying 2 of these. But we just have it in a den so it would look tacky and weird to have two side by side. But overall it is what I wanted, as far as the foot pedal and odor goes. Just a little small.
B004G8QT5C|4|This was top rated in consumer reports and well reviewed on Amazon so we went for it.  Overall we've been very happy with it and my 3-year old son loves it.      PROS: The shoulder strap design is nice that it automatically adjusts to the correct shoulder height.  Though if they fall to the bottom they're difficult to get back up if your kid is already in the seat.  Tension adjustment takes some getting used to and the release catch to loosen the harness is tricky.  Install is easy and there is plenty of room for my kids to grow into it.  It should last both kids until they're at least five.    CONS: This thing is WIDE.  We've got it in a Honda CR-V with another seat on the other side and there is little hope anyone would fit in between.  Also, the cup holder is flimsy and mostly useless.  We haven't used it much but I'd imagine it will be quick to break when we do.  Finally, a lot of the structure is the impact styrofoam, so it's a little squeaky at times, but we only notice it when we're loading or unloading with the engine off.  No noticeable noise while driving.    NOTE: But we've only had it in the forward facing condition and my son was 2.5yrs old when we got it.  I can't comment on rear facing or small baby configurations.
B004LLHB5Q|4|A simple and reasonably inexpensive option for nice looking crib rail padding.
B004T8NN9E|5|It spills a lot but my daughter loves it. So I let her practice with it empty, which she loves too.
B002UD65XQ|5|So far this matress cover has been good. My daughter doesnt have a problem at all with wetting the bed and I've got it on her bed but just in case we decided to order one when we ordered her mattress and boxspring to keep it protected and last longer. Isn't crinkly like old school ones as my husband puts it.
B00GVZ69PI|5|Recommended by the hospital! High quality pacifiers! Even the pediatrician recommended this brand! Buy with confidence! I highly recommend this product!
B0009XBXIQ|5|I just received my Joovy Parent Organizer.  Joovy finally came up with a design that works for the sit n stand.  It is made of a neoprene (wetsuit) material and it slips over the handles and is flat when empty, so it doesn't interfere with the folding.  There's a drink holder, two large pockets and one zipper section.  Perfect! The lack of a organizer was the only thing I disliked about this stroller.  Otherwise it does the trick... I have a 2.5, 4.5 and 3 month old and this stroller works well.  It's really easy to fold up, however a little heavy to pick up and put in the car.  It's about the same as any double/tandem stroller... maybe just a tad bit heavier.  It seems kind of long when steering around stores, however the swiveling double front wheels make it easy to turn. And I can steer one handed when I need to. I have an infant carier which sits in the front, and this makes it a little uncomfortable for the second child to sit in the back and this is because the front seat has to recline in order for the infant carrier to fit snuggly. Standing is no problem for the second child when the infant carrier is in.  Joovy has a new shade cover which fits over the whole stroller and covers the child in the back.  I don't have this - but I'm thinking of getting it.  I don't think this stroller would be good on long day trips ie: Disneyland, because the child in the back can't exactly relax or nap.  I have a double reclining umbrella stroller we use when we want to travel, or have two kids nap.
B004BJ0SPS|5|Got this for my parents' house and we were pleasantly surprised by its size and quality construction -- and how bright and visible it is!  Perfect for end of their driveway. We put a couple of small rocks inside it, just in case it wanted to blow down the street, but that was never even an issue.  Folds back up flat for easy storage.  We have the 'man with the flag' at home but I much prefer this for ease of use and visibility.  Very happy with our purchase - and it was less than ten dollars. Great wasy to feel safe when kids are outside playing.
B00CWN3HQM|5|awesome product
B00B7TESWY|2|My daughter would kick and it wouldn't bounce. You have to reall pounce on this thing to get it to move. I added some rings and other things to make it entertaining for her.
B00008GYD0|1|I am very, very dissapointed with this breast pump, it takes me about an hour just to pump one side and I only used it once or twice a week. Also it's hard to clean, way too many parts, and milk always gets into the handle. I do not recomend it to any one!
B004OR1DQK|5|easy to use,baby like it
B00FG6G7XM|4|I wish it would stick better but so far it protects our coffee table well.
B00B501F4Y|5|These changing pad liners are awesome! We don;t use a changing table and usually just change her diaper on our bed. I put one of these down and it's perfect! I also have one in my diaper bag. It fold up very slim and takes up almost no space. It's great to use on the go on a changing table in a restroom, in your car, etc. I wish they had other designs so I could get a few more!
B000GRLZZQ|5|This floppy, cuddly, little guy has been a huge part of our family for about 4 years now.  My daughter received this as a gift when she was 6 months old and is completely attached! I was actually looking for a replacement \\"just in case\\" we love him!
B000T9792O|2|These pads seemed like a good price to try for something that was reusable.  They got soaked pretty quick in the first weeks of breastfeeding so I used all 6 in a day, though that's typically when engorgement happens so there's a lot to soak up when leaking.  They were also very lumpy and didn't look good under clothes.
B0016KV73W|5|This was such a great purchase. My little one is almost ready to be out of diapers for good. This is small enough to fit in a tote bag and is pretty discreet. It is a little low when used on its own. Much lower than his potty at home. I have to point him down so he doesn't pee over the top of it, BUT, for a quick pee when we are out of the house this is wonderful!
B004MSWMBG|5|We have used the minky sleep sack for 8 months and have just ordered the same one in the next size up. My little one lives hers and has plenty of room for her wiggly, kicky routine before falling asleep.
B0089M3V4S|1|Junk
B00J5S3ZOQ|5|Perfect for my shoebox gifts
B0010L98DI|5|This is a great product for a new mom who is not sure about mixing baby formula.  Bought it for my daughter and she loves it.
B000RFFQEI|5|I used these Munchkin straws to fix a lost platex straw. The diameter is correct. It was a little too long and needed to be cut down a little.
B005PWVIZE|1|The only reason these still do anything is because my toddler (age 2) is used to seeing them on the cabinets.  After he undoes the double sliders to remove them (and opens the cabinet to get whatever he wants out of it), he will helpfully close the cabinet again, put this back over the knobs, and slide the latches back in place.<br /><br />They're useful only to slow him down very slightly, and that wasn't my goal.  If you have something that can't possibly be latched by any other means and slowing your toddler down is sufficient, these might work for you.  Otherwise, try something else.
B0039MIUXA|5|This is a great little stool. After a couple of years, the little nylon protectors on the bottom of the legs began to break off. I contacted the manufacturer (web site was on the label on the underside) and inquired about purchasing replacement protectors.<br /><br />I received a prompt email saying they would be happy to take care of it at no charge. I assumed they would mail me the protectors. However, a few days later, I received a brand new stool.<br /><br />Awesome customer service!!!
B000056JEG|2|I really liked the Medela products at first, but I never really liked these bags, mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them.  If you get too much milk in the bag, it will leak when you close it up.  Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked, causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean.  Plus, the bag got stuck in the puddle.  <br />I have also used the Gerber bags, and I liked those much better.
B001IACJQ4|4|easy to assemble. 3o mins to put together. good for the price since I got 15% off at baby-registry with amazon mom membership.<br />pretty comfy.
B00AHVR94W|5|My Daughter an I loved this much easier for me and her, when climbing into the car and out as well
B000RFG066|5|My son was having trouble with the soft-spout sippy cups so I decided to come on Amazon and look for some hard-spout ones instead. I landed on these and I'm glad I did because we both love these cups! He has an easier time drinking from them (compared to soft-spout cups) and they are easy for him to hold himself. They've never leaked and are easy to clean as far as sippy cups go. (If you have any other nuk cups you know the drill---lid, valve, cup) Another reviewer mentioned not being able to get the valves in and they are a tight fit but I've never had any issues putting them in or taking them out.<br /><br />Like a couple other reviewers I did not receive the color/pattern pictured. I received the cups with the faces on them. A little bummed out because even the description lists specific options but it's overall the same cup so I can't complain too much. Just keep that in mind when ordering.
B0028LXK74|5|This bedding is awesome as far as quality and price. It comes with all the pieces you need for your nursery. The colors are vibrant and it is very well made. I was very pleased to get so much for the price. Highly recommended.
B00I2HDG7W|4|Extremely cheap but pretty much what I expected for the price. Easy to assemble and looks nice.
B00HR8UBAW|5|Love the car seat.
B003XMWF2S|5|Somehow I think my toddler nephew thinks food tastes much better when he uses his little spoon and fork.  That works for me!!!
B0055LV4MM|5|Great for keeping my pets in/out of rooms.
B00BQ3H706|5|Great quality at a lower price.  Soft and everything fits perfectly.
B00003TL7P|5|This is a great product, so easy to use. I so far have had no smell. It is so easy to use. My daughter who is five loves helping me dispose of her little brothers' diapers. I would highly recommend this diaper pail to anyone. Its nice not to have to buy special liners and so much easier to use than the diaper genie. I can't say enough good things about this product.
B006YPTZRO|5|A LITTLE HARD TO DRINK,BUT THE QUALITY IS VERY GOOD.
B004AHKUHM|5|Bought this as a replacement for a Philips DECT monitor that cost 3x more. The Philips monitor's battery died, and the replacement cost almost as much as this unit. Wow, this Graco unit has much better volume and battery life. And if you carry the parent unit around, it also has a vibrate feature to alert you when your little tyke wakes up. The \\"DECT\\" technology is billed as more secure and less prone to interference from your electronics (may be true - despite the flaws of the DECT it did have impressive range and resistance to other wireless devices). However, this Graco unit worked well enough at 100-200 feet (across the length of the house, and on a different floor) without significant interference from wireless internet equipment or cordless phones. It did drop signal once from the basement (baby on 2nd floor) - but probably shouldn't be that far from the troublemaker anyhow...
B00I0D2U84|3|Ok, I purchased this for my son because everyone told me that the regular bumpers are not safe for an infant (every year there's a new list of &#34;used to be safe last year, but not this year!&#34;) but the regular bumpers are not safe for good reason.<br /><br />This mesh bumper still does the job. its ok, but it's just &#34;ok&#34; for the following reasons:<br />1) Installing it is not so straightforward, you really have to re-read the directions.<br />2) You tie the sections to the vertical crib slats, but cribs are all pretty much smooth/varnished wood so when you tie the mesh bumper sections to the vertical slats on your crib, it doesn't really grip very tightly and will slide down. When that happens my son has put his foot through the vertical crib slats, above the mesh bumper and got his leg caught in between the crib slats. This has only happened a few times. My wife and I are very diligent with watching him on the baby monitor as he falls asleep and we can hear him if he does that because he will cry out.<br />3) My son is 9 months old, he discovered at about 7 months that he can untie the sections that are normally tied to the crib slats. And he puts those, now untied pieces of ribbon in his mouth. he's only done it a few times and it hasn't been a hazard but it don't like that he's been able to untie the knot so easily.<br /><br />There are ways that this product could be improved:<br />1) make the mesh much taller, that way it could be higher and prevent kids from putting their legs above the mesh bumper and getting their feet/legs caught in the vertical crib slats.<br />2) If the mesh bumper was taller, you would be able to tie the sections to the TOP RAIL OF THE CRIB. then the infant wouldnt be able to pull the mesh bumper down. Right now my son, if he decided to, can easily slide down the mesh bumper since the sections are tied to the vertical crib slats and the ribbon cant grip the smooth/varnished slats.<br />3) Make those &#34;ribbon ties&#34; atleast DOUBLE THE LENGTH! when you tie the sections to the vertical slats, you have just enough to make a bow and its really difficult to make it very tight with the amount of ribbon provided. I would love to make a double knot. One way that I can fix this my self is to sew additional lengths of ribbon to the existing ribbon.<br /><br />Like the subject says, it's ok...barely!
B00BZO1PEA|1|I purchased this chair for the easy to clean and modern look. Very unhappy with it. The seat is textured and has stained in a very short time. There is a crevasse around where the tray clips in and food gets trapped in there at every meal. The seat cover does come off very easily and can be wiped down but under the cover is also a lot of compartments where the food gets trapped. There is also a large gap between the tray and baby so it is very easy to drop food onto the seat. The tray is not adjustable. I am so unhappy with this chair that I am getting rid of it and getting a different one. Would not recommend.
B00O10L87O|5|These are easy for my 5 month old to hold and she enjoys chewing on them. I like that I can put them in the sterilizer and that there are four of them, so one is always available.
B00CZDCWVU|5|This was a gift and the person was very pleased and thought the color was cute.
B0053Y2B6E|4|If anyone else is having a problem with the filter in this product the trick is that it unscrews apart, not pulls apart.  Meg from Be By Baby was super helpful and prompt getting back to me on what the issue was.  Wish the manufacturer provided instructions that would have saved me from the get go, but other than that it seems like a fabulous product.
B00LZKBUT4|5|I have an Ergo that I used with my first baby and plan to use for the second as well. I didn't have an infant insert for the first one and I wish I had! The Ergo on it's own is too big for a newborn baby, and I couldn't use mine until LO was 6months old. If you have an Ergo and a newborn, this is a must!!
B00FBDBEA6|5|These are cute and practical.  As my son has grown, I have bought and washed several sets.  They're still as good as new.  I'm very happy with them.
B001EDDUYU|5|Our family loved it!!
B00B5O3LSS|5|Hands down this is the BEST monitor out there!!!! My husband and I have been testing it today and we are so highly impressed with this product!!! It is so simple to use. What's even more amazing about this monitor, is that it almost seems like it does a 360 rotation of the room the current camera is in and you can adjust the camera using the monitor itself. You don't have to go back to the camera and adjust it there. The monitor plays music and it has a two way voice system so the baby can hear you and you can hear your baby. The night vision quality is superb!<br /><br />Thanks Levana!
B000YDDF6O|5|My baby has loved this toy since the day he got his hands on it.  The lights and music are just the thing to stop him in his tracks when he is crying sometimes.  We call this his \\"ipod.\\"  It's easy for him to keep hold of and carry around.  When other babies and toddlers are at our house, this seems to attract them too.  Someone is always carrying it around.  The music is not annoying at all.  Also, I love that there is a switch to turn the toy off, on low volume, or on high volume.  Great little toy!  I will be gifting this to friends having babies.
B00KBGTRAC|1|This only gets one star because it cannot be used as intended. It is very portable. But is very dangerous for a mobile baby. We purchased this play pen, and within a day of use my 13 month old got his foot up on the frame. The mesh fabric is weak and does not hold its shape allowing my son to easily step on the frame from the inside of the play pen. It wasn't long before he stepped on it, pulled himself up and fell over and out. Hurting himself, but not badly. Due to this incident, and the fact that it happening again cannot be prevented, we are returning the Summer Infant Pop n Play. Because the fabric is not tight and the design of the frame is so easily reached through the thin fabric, it can be used as a ladder. The potential for injury and serious injury is great.
B000TXUNOQ|1|I give it one star because the idea is great!<br /><br />I was given an older version of the Munchkin brand rear view mirror and loved it!  However, it broke.  We were super sad because we relied on it a lot.  So I saw this one and decided to buy without even checking the reviews.<br />The mirror is so distorted it's really hard to see. I attached it thinking it would be ok, not a big deal, but the instant my husband used the car and looked through he said, \\"please return this thing\\".<br />Done, returned.  It's that bad.  Please don't buy it, there's better ones out there.
B00NAAVAQ0|5|The bath towels are soft and large enough to wrap around my 2 year old granddaughter. As she has a new baby brother, it was time to order a new set of friendly animals for both of them. They wash well and come out of the dryer soft and fluffy. All 4 of the towels came together well packed and was delivered to my door within the week. I am very happy with my purchase.
B000IDSLOG|4|Hello,   I have purchased ove 5 Sophie dolls from Amazon, LLC adn all of them but one have been perfect. One of them i gave to my friend for her baby boy and the dots fell off, the rubber started smelling weird and the paint was wiping off. I am very sad this happened so i wanted to pass on the info. Hopefully the stock can be reviewed to make sure no Fake sophies are in the bunch. Overall i have never had any issues with my purchases from Amazon. Thanks for listening.   [[ASIN:B000IDSLOG Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether]]
B00AWAWMHC|5|Very happy with this product.
B004HFQOLS|5|After reading what seemed a million reviews and comparing this pump to the much pricier Medela pump, I decided on this one hoping that I would not be disappointed. I have not been for a single moment. I have been using it now daily for 3 months, sometimes twice a day, and it works like a charm!<br /><br />It comes with a very nice carrying case, which I was never sure of when reading reviews. It is something between a saddle bag and a suitcase but it is very simple and concealing, which I appreciate as I walk thru downtown to get to work.<br /><br />The pump really is very easy to clean. This was something that had sort of confused me as a first time mom who knew nothing of pump parts, etc. but it really was almost self explanatory to do even the first time, and it can be done easily. All the parts can be easily cleaned with the standard bottle brush, and run thru the sterilizer.<br /><br />It has a completely \\"manual\\" way of setting the speed and pressure with which it pumps, not a knob with different standard levels, so essentially you can literally customize it every time you use it and it is so easy to change the setting to faster or slower with the push of the blue button on the handle. I have been unfortunately battling with thrush which makes pumping sometimes very painful so this ability to manually set the pressure on my extra-sensitive days was heaven-sent!<br /><br />It pumps directly into the Avent bottles which I think are just wonderful. I do however use the edge liner that now comes with the bottles when I attach the bottle to the pump because as with the bottles if I left it out they do leak if turned sideways.<br /><br />I produce a lot so I expected that it would take me long to express, but this pump actually works very quickly. I am able to pump 10 ounces in 10 minutes even after feeding. One thing that helped me pump faster, and I imagine it will depend on everyone's individual anatomy, was to remove the silicone suction covers and pump directly with the plastic pump part. The silicone piece for me was only getting milk stuck in it and felt too small of a suction hole so when I removed it, things worked much more efficiently.<br /><br />I read this in one review and it is absolutely true... This pump IS the Isis Duo. The manual and instruction DVD that come with the pump are actually labeled Isis Duo, so if you were debating spending more to get the name, this is the same product.<br /><br />All in all, l am so glad that I decided on this pump. I don't think for a second that I would've been happier with any pricer pump and definitely believe that it has helped me keep my goal of exclusively breastfeeding my newborn, even as I go back to work. Highly recommended!!!with the plastic pump part.

B005XJ2VH8|5|We bought this for our first child and have no regrets. The removable tray is a must on any highchair. The option to recline back is also a nice option but we don't use it that much. It also rolls great on carpet. My parents have a different brand at their house and it does not roll well, which is a pain.
B001OC62VY|5|I love it!! It is my second option whenever it is not possible to use the Inglesina fast table chair. It keeps my 11 month old daughter comfortable and away from the germs and dirty surfaces of the high chairs in restaurants. easy to carry, fold and unfold. I recommend it
B00BXP9IIG|4|Great shell but I was under he impression it came with inserts. This is not the case. The inserts need to be purchased additionally
B00005BSXI|5|We have had this monitor for over a year and it has worked wonderfully.  The audio only monitor is clearer than 2 others we tried.  Even on the lowest setting I can hear just the baby and not all static or constant hiss which is helpful when you are a light sleeper.   <br /> <br />The video monitor is so great to see what our little one is doing in his crib.  Sounds I would have thought were cries I can see him playing with his toys and don't rush in right away and let him wake up slowly or play in his crib.  I often use the tv with just the video on without the sound when I am in the kitchen - I can see the lights diminish as he falls asleep without having to listen to every squawk and protest to a nap.   <br /> <br />Great product.
B000056JMU|5|Love playtex drop ins, works well in a house of multiples (we have two sets of twins and used them with both sets).
B00EYDTTHE|4|I love that these have snaps instead of velcro and the two snaps allow for these to grow as baby grows. The other big plus is that they are waterproof for this teething/drooling stage, but that also makes them a bit stiff, so it's a trade off. I wish they had some more neutral colors, but the price was great.
B00M7BHQIY|2|The  flap that goes over doesn't really go all the way closed like they cut it too short. After a while of using it it started making this weird noise so we stopped using it.
B001AXF5EC|5|Excellent and cute product
B0035RQF54|5|One of the best baby/toddler safety items we have used. Preventing un-authorized entry to higher risk rooms, such as kitchens or computer rooms, without hindering easy entry by grown-ups. Very sturdy, well-constructed, easy to use and easy to install. Stress-tested by two strong and determined 3 1/2 year olds.
B00DJP131I|3|It cannot be reclined while baby/child is seated in it. It is extremely bulky (but quite sturdy), and, thus, terribly challenging to buckle in and remove. We lugged this massive seat with us on trip where we had to fly and then get a rental car. It took us 30 mins (no exaggeration) to get it buckled into an unfamiliar car. It was also very heavy to carry from baggage claim, and I won't be taking it on any future trips.
B00E8KJYNC|5|Is the best
B002ZG7JQA|5|After much deliberation (my son is 6 months old and we still hadn't purchased a crib!) I decided to buy a mini crib. It was a great price and I thought it would work better in my son's tiny nursery than a regular full sized crib. I am SO glad I bought this crib! It's small enough so that I was able to have it next to my bed as sort of a \\"co sleeper\\" but then when we moved it into my son's room it looked perfect in there. A full sized crib would have been way too big. This crib was fairly easy to put together - I did most of it by myself until the end when I needed my husband's help. It is well-made and the finish is beautiful. We love the espresso color. We love that we can use it as a head and foot board later on when he's in a twin sized bed. I bought the CRESCENT MINI CRIB 50 COIL MATTRESS by Da Vinci to use instead of the ridiculously thin mattress that came with it. The mattress I bought is the same thickness as a regular crib mattress and fits perfectly. The ONLY place (that I have found) that sells crib sheets that will fit this particular mattress is [...] (they are 25 dollars a piece! But very well made, and I think worth it). We also bough the breathable bumper in white for mini cribs. FITS PERFECTLY! All and all, we are extremely happy with this purchase. No disappointments. We were able to find accessories that work with it as well.
B00JBYNNB4|5|I like it. But I wish the sound was louder.<br />My 2yr old boy likes it.
B00000IVWV|5|I originally bought this toy because my six-month-old baby seemed to be losing interest in his other playgym, that is, he would roll away after five minutes of batting at the toys.  As a stay-at-home mom, I needed a  safe place to rest my playpen-hating baby so that I could get some  housework done.  I figured that, at the very least, this playnest's  doughnut shape would keep him from rolling from room to room while I made a  meal, etc.  Well, hallelujah, he likes it so much that I can make a meal  and maybe even a phonecall while he entertains himself.  First, I start out  by putting him on his back to swat at the toys hanging from the pretend  &quot;sky&quot; -- a fabric sun, moon, bird, etc.  Each toy does something  fun like crinking, rattling, or playing music.  You also can adjust the  height of each toy with the enclosed plastic rings.  Next, I prop him  inside the ring for some sitting practice.  Finally, I lean him  stomach-down on the side of the innertube so that he can play with the  activities on the fabric cover, including a crinkly fabric door that opens  and closes, different-textured fabrics, and a squeaky duck bill.  This  playnest is my salvation.  What don't I like?  Well, the vertical posts  that form the pretend sky pop inwards periodically.  It looks a little  strange, but it doesn't affect the toy's playing potential.  Second,  contrary to the product info on the box, I don't think this playnest is  suitable for a very young baby.  There's not enough room to lay the baby  completely flat at the bottom, and a tiny infant would be uncomfortable  propped against the sides like the baby pictured on the box (I'm guessing  that poor kid rolled right over as soon as the picture was taken!)  But,  provided that your baby has at least some sitting ability (even with help),  I recommend this toy wholeheartedly!
B004HFQOLI|5|I love it
B0016KV8DG|5|Great! Perfect and compact.
B00JBYN0D0|5|Love this bottle brush! Bottles can be such a hassle to clean, but this Munchkin LATCH brush gets every groove and crevice of the bottle. I also like how it it's colorful and obviously stands out from other brushes that are for dishes - I don't ever want my husband or anyone else who might possibly be doing dishes to get the bottle brush confused with a brush for dishes!
B000KJBFC8|4|Used this for my 3 year old and 18 month old on a trip from Colorado to California. Good for coloring, holding toys, and snacks.
B00393E3NK|5|I love these they're well worth the money. My son Takes this to school every day and it has shown no signs of wear and tear yet. We also have the Fox version of the backpack and the thermos bag, we have had them for two years and they still show no signs of wear and tear and we machine wash them all the time.
B002V92XAS|4|Works as well as can be expected. Better than competition, but doesn't completely hide odors.
B001D7HLTW|5|Love these sleep sacks.  Perfect weight for summer sleeping.
B0052QYLUM|5|I purchased this item when my son was about 6 months old, after my pediatrician suggested replacing my audio monitor with a video version as a step to getting him to sleep through the night.  This model has a fantastic balance of quality and price.  I know someone who has a monitor that has a 2-way intercom system, remote control for adjusting the camera in baby's room from the receiver, and other functions that I feel are frivolous, and cost something like 5 times as much as this one.  While the functions on the DXR-5 may be more simplistic, it really is all I need and the price can't be beat. It has a full-color daylight mode, and an automatic night vision mode when the light becomes dim.  I keep mine on \\"VOX\\" mode where the monitor display turns off after a certain period of inactivity within baby's room, and comes back on only when a button is pressed on the receiver to check on baby, or if baby stirs.  This feature is great, because it seems to work with major motions or sounds.  If my son wakes up and is rolling around in bed for a while, I can choose to go get him before he gets worked up and starts crying... which is the point at which you know that baby is awake using a traditional audio monitor.  As a result, my son is generally in a far better mood, because he doesn't get a chance to get upset.  I can also choose to leave him for a little while if it appears he might go back to sleep.  When the batteries are low on the receiver, it beeps for about a minute before going dead to remind you to charge it.<br /><br />My receiver stopped functioning properly 8 months or so after I purchased it.  (Too many accidental drops?)  I hoped to buy another receiver instead of buying a whole brand new unit, but when I contacted the company to see whether this was an option (as I only found additional cameras for sale) they helped me troubleshoot. When it was determined that the receiver was indeed malfunctioning, I was told that I could send the whole unit back, photograph my shipping receipt, and email the picture to them.  They would then get a new unit in the mail to me free of charge upon receipt of the proof that I'd sent the item back, before they actually received the item!  If not for a snowstorm, I would have received the new unit within 24 hours of sending the old one back... as it was it took fewer than 48 hours.<br /><br />Great company to work with, and great product.  I highly recommend it for all parents in need of a baby monitor.  As an aside, between this monitor and a few tweaks in my son's schedule, I got him sleeping 10-12 hours per night, versus the 1-3 hour stretches he'd been having previously.  He has kept this up ever since, and he's now 18 months old.<br /><br />4.2.14 UPDATE:  I dropped my replacement monitor and the antenna cover broke off.  Before I was able to glue it back on, the little wire inside broke off, disappeared, and left the monitor with a very poor signal.  I contacted Infant Optics again, and had another monitor on my doorstep less than 16 hours after I sent them proof that I'd shipped mine back.  I can't speak highly enough about this company and their customer service.
B00SZ5UGWO|5|So cute and works well!
B00KB58JX4|5|Life saver. This is the only correctly sized, actually comfortable, and portable option for pack and play sleeping.
B004672QYG|5|My son loves this kids table and chair set. It was very easy to put together and is the perfect height for his age.
B00CCKC108|5|GREAT for infants at the beach! It kept the sun and sand away from my little one.
B00AFBM1RO|4|i would give this a 5 star review except for the smell. it smells like a tire shop or something...but for the price, cuteness (pictures don't do these things justice! they are adorable!!), and the good construction (looks high quality to me) it deserves a positive review. also, shipping time was really impressive, arrived way before the estimated time frame.<br /><br />***for those who own one of these backpacks...anyone have luck getting rid of the smell? I've tried a couple things with no luck (hung on a clothesline in the sun for week hoping that would air it out) and putting fabric softeners in them...maybe febreeze would work? any suggestion is appreciated...thanks :)
B000U9PUCO|5|I keep this on the car seat in the car.  My baby loves to bat it around, pull on it, and bite on it.  When he was around 3 to 5 months, this toy could keep him interested for a while in the house, but now that he is 7 months, the crinkle sound it makes when you hold it doesn't hold his attention as long.  So, as a toy hanging from his seat while in a car with nothing else to do, he enjoys playing with this.
B003HS5JPI|5|Best little rattle for a newborn baby! The sharp contrast of the black and white really holds our baby's attention. She liked this toy right away and it calms her. Plus now that she is 5 months and teething this is a great soft toy that she can chew on. She also loves the crinkle sounds in the ears and paws when she plays with it. Absolutely recommend this rattle for any newborn.<br /><br />Please let me know if this review was helpful. I hope your baby loves this as much as mine did :)
B0052QYLUM|2|I wanted to like this product.  I wanted it to be good at this price.  With all the reviews I had high hopes.  It just fell far short.<br /><br />&#62; My biggest complaint is the microphone.  It does not do a good enough job picking up noises in the room and picking them up clearly.  I should not have to wait for a child to be in meltdown to know something is going on, or to be sure.<br /><br />&#62; This in part stems from the second shortcoming, the volume.  Turned all the way up, this could not wake the dead.  And if you have an infant, you are catching zzz's when you can so you are sleeping like the dead.<br /><br />&#62; I also found it odd I could not view the screen from certain angles.  This was an annoyance, but otherwise the screen is decent in lit situations and IR, just a bit grainy.<br /><br />&#62; A bit of wifi interference, but it wasn't as bad as I would have thought.<br /><br />In short, I did not feel I could rely on this unit to wake me, the microphone needs more gain and they need to work on the volume.  If they fix these issues, the unit would be worthwhile.
B000AKB4IM|5|Great gag gift at a baby shower.
B001PTGPYK|5|My 2 year old daughter loves this stool. I originally bought it for potty training, but it is light enough for her to carry throughout the house whenever she can't reach something. It is sturdy enough that even I have used it on occasion, and the no-slip bottom gives me peace of mind that she is safe while using it.
B00A65YN8E|5|Really a sharp looking sprayer. Love that you can adjust the pressure via the valve connected to the tank. No problems with leakage; just be sure to use plumbers tape on EVERY connection. Very happy with it.
B005HB7IFW|1|We have these on two door knobs.  It took forever for me to get them apart to put on the door, but apparently the trick to get them apart is to get an 20-month old to spin them around the door knob and they pop right off.  We bought several brands to try out which work best.  This one is definitely being replaced!
B000PKXD6S|5|best changing table ever.... my daughter is now 1 and we still use it every time
B002SW3B0O|5|You can't beat Aden & Anais. So soft, so multi-use. These were a gift.
B0033UWSYK|3|I wish this was as good as I had hoped it would be. I washed it (following their instructions) and it looked like it came from a garage sale or 2nd hand store after only ONE wash! So far it has only fit well on a couple of carts and those aren't from the standard dept stores like the W-mart or Target. It IS soft, it WAS cute (before washing)and it IS nice that you can stuff it in its bag that is attached. I don't use the zippered pouch because my son kicks it and whatever is in it but the bag that the seat stuffs into is nice to put my stuff into. Oh and the biggest problem is that the straps don't stay in place. I had to not them which makes for a HUGE pain. They are too slippery and don't stay where I adjust them to. When I first received the seat there weren't any straps but Amazon was great about sending a replacement right away.<br /><br />Just make sure you know what is important and how much you are willing to modify a BRAND new product before you buy!
B003N0JXSE|3|I like that the detergent is environmentally friendly, but it doesn't get the stink out. We switched to Tide and have much better results.
B001ET5U2E|5|I bought this for my 6 mo old grandson and he LOVES it.  He chews and chews and drools and drools!  The first day he used it, he chewed so much his gums were a little bit sore the next day.  However, the following day he grabbed for it again and chowed down!  He's kind of a picky baby and not many things seem to entertain him for long periods of time.  He especially didn't seem to like any of the teethers he has and just wouldn't use them, but he plays with this teether for hours!!  In fact, I came back to Amazon to order a couple more.  This worked out great for us.
B0035QVHOE|5|My year old granddaughter loved it. It is perfectly sized and safe for an infant to hold and play.
B003EGTXN2|5|Very handy to have around my only concern is that baby sits really low in it and the top is always in his face.
B00SWI7IQG|5|Received in 2days! Worth the money. Would buy again.
B00MH6HHLA|5|Love this frame! Great gift for any cheerleader! :)
B0042D69WO|5|My son is almost five months old and weighs 17lbs and it still swings him great, we bouht this swing when he was two months old. It has a cute design and i love that i can turn it three ways. It does take up alot of space but worth it.
B0009UBSF2|1|I bought this monitor from amazon six months ago. The rechargeable aspect never worked well. Now the receiver no longer works.  My old monitor from safety first worked for 4 years!!!
B000096QQ3|1|I could not get my little one to use these nipples. They are extremely small. I also was not crazy about the bottles since they have five separate pieces to wash!! Good gracious, like you won't have enough to do as a new mom! I much prefer the Avent bottles over these for sure.
B00A7DVOO6|5|just the right thing for my grandson who loves music to go to sleep
B006PB2G14|3|I ordered this specifically for the functionality and color.  Something I can tote around easily and still have features like a diaper changer and bassinet.  The assembly is pretty simple and straight forward, reminds me of a tent.  The part I don't like is the comfort of the mat, which has sections under the fabric to help for storage(it folds around the pin and velcros in place to hold it securely), but seems to be thin and the metal reinforcements can easily be felt through it in playpen mode.  I really like the product still although I'm probably going to make a pad of some kind to cushion it more.<br /><br />Something I didn't notice in the product pictures before was that the resolution of the koi pattern is very low and pixelated.  Which is fine, but a little unexpected.  Another grievance is that almost every element has it's own tag and needs to be cut off.  The diaper changer has one printed on the white area.  Not exactly like the photos but still nice, functional and good for mobility.
B0018LRDIM|5|It doesn't matter how much research you do into how long it takes your body to metabolize alcohol out of your breast milk; you will still feel unsure the first time you go to nurse after you've been drinking. People will suggest \\"pump and dump\\" but it's actually a falsehood. Your body metabolizes alcohol out of breast milk the same way it metabolizes it out of your bloodstream, so you needn't pour the precious breast milk down the drain. The only reason you would need to \\"pump and dump\\" after drinking would be if your beasts were uncomfortably full. While the general rule of thumb is that if you feel drunk, your milk is no good, you can never be too safe when it comes to the safety of your child.<br /><br />These seem expensive, ranging from about $1.50 to $2.50 each, depending on the size package you want. Even at the high end, this is a small price to pay for peace of mind when nursing your baby. If you have trouble justifying the price, think about it as less than half the price of a drink. They are incredibly easy to use; I squeeze the milk directly from my breasts onto the strips. They change color quickly and the readings have always been clear. After you use these a few times, you will get a good idea of what the result will without the test strips. However, they are nice to have around for those times when you just aren't sure. I would rather be safe than sorry so I continue to use them anytime I've had more than a couple of drinks, even when a decent amount of time has passed. After all, if I can afford the alcohol I should be able to spend a little more to buy these test strips and know for sure that my milk is safe for my beautiful baby girl.
B000096LWJ|4|We've recently moved over to playtex from nuk and really like the product by my only question is, how come the arrow on the lid does not match up with the line on the cup itself. I have tried tirelessly to get the two to match up but it's impossible. It's not leaking at all so it's no problem I just find it strange that it doesn't match up.
B003JH7ZFE|5|quick ! safely received!
B00BGY935C|5|I initially bought the Ergo (on sale at Target) even though I really wanted the Beco (primarily because the Beco allows you to wear your baby facing in and out and with the Ergo your baby can only face in. I wore the Ergo for about four months before finally breaking down and buying the Beco. Beco for the win! It's so much easier to put on (with a squirming baby) than the Beco and my baby seems infinitely more comfortable in the Beco than the Ergo. The front flap is wonderful when the baby is very young and needs the extra head support (and it's also super useful for keeping the baby warm). Easy to adjust, lots of options to keep the baby's legs in different positions and even at 11 months (and a whopping 24 pounds), I can wear him for a couple of hours without feeling neck and back pain.
B00WWSDQO0|4|Wow, I wasn't supposed to get this for another 7 days!  Looks great.  Haven't had a chance to use it yet but it looks good so far.
B0012J45CW|5|I bought this stroller a few years ago. It was my 2nd attempt at a double stroller. My kids are 11 months apart. Now they are 9mo, 3 1/2, and 4 1/2.  I can have even the 2 bigger kids in it and it still turns nice. Great for walks on a bumpy sidewalk cause the wheels are a little bigger. Much lighter then most double strollers. Lots of room underneath for stuff.  Very good buy. Very happy.
B00KNYVXO0|5|this one fit great and worked fine. My wife and i are very happy with product.
B0028K2RME|1|Make another choice and buy something else. You can barely hear the sound. Other than the sound it was okay. I returned it.
B00H8MSOVK|5|Perfect for my tall 3 year old.  He is very comfortable in it and feels like a &#34;big kid&#34;.  Great look and feel.
B00I50PLWE|2|Not at all as stylish as I thought it'd be, looking at the picture.
B004T8NQAU|5|high quality,and as useful as my imagine.
B00IK6JTSA|5|Looks great, and it was bigger than I thought. That was a plus :)
B007MCSUF6|4|I just received my stroller lest than a week ago i took it out for the first time today and I have pros and cons of this item so lets just get to the point<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />- Awesome shade it covers both children comfortably but it may obstruct the view of the child sitting in the rear seat but GREAT for a napping child<br />- Great style, Looks AMAZING I've been complimented many times on my choice of color I chose the Green and Brown stroller<br />- Folds Nicely and smaller than expected<br />- Awesome 4 wheel locks i live in Washington DC and I commute quite a bit so great for taking the train<br />- It fits through all door just like a single stroller<br />- As we all know GREAT PRICE !<br /><br />Cons (which may be deal breakers for some but still worked for myself with other alternatives which are noted)<br /><br />- EXTREMELY small under carriage (no biggie I carry a backpack style diaper bag so it works well)<br />- Steering can be VERY challenging making sharp turns<br />- No cup holders (i purchased the  Childless Cups 'N Cargo Stroller Organizer which makes up for the lack of under carriage space as well)<br />- Assembly was a bit vague for the stroller's canopy but not too hard to figure out<br />- its a bit short I'm 5'6 and walking downhill is a bit of a challenge i constantly kick the wheel which is annoying<br />- Poorly stitched Velcro (it came off the first day and I'm concerned that the stroller will someday just fall apart)<br />- NO RAIN COVER ! (maybe they are considering the canopy a rain cover but its not )<br />- the front seat is a bit awkward it doesn't bend down so my youngest legs always stick straight out<br /><br />overall this stroller fits the bill for the price and it's purpose
B00CJD5Y4I|3|Nice but with no top staps to put around the headrest, the back just slides down.  No big deal but it help.  At least the seat stays clean.
B00F58OB4I|5|A great product!
B000S35QLC|2|This monitor works well in generally all regards, with a significant and persistent exception: the out-of-range alert. The beeping has worsened since we've owned the thing and is based on no discernible factors whatsoever -- certainly not some great distance between ours and the baby's rooms, in our not-exactly-palatial Manhattan apartment. The beeping frequently starts in the middle of the night after hours of quiet when no one is awake to have moved or adjusted the monitor. (Until the beeping starts. Then we're all awake.) It's unsustainable and we will be purchasing another one after a whopping 9 months of use. Pretty poor value at almost any price.
B000RFAYCW|5|This is for a Birthdat gift
B00M4UM9M6|5|util
B004YWKWJO|4|Pros:<br />Ease of use<br />Cute colors<br />Safer than safety pins<br /><br />Cons:<br />My husband seems to snap and break these fairly often. Not sure if it is the way he handles them, but in 4 months, he has broken 3.<br /><br />The white ones seem to get dirty easily. Sometimes, blue jeans will rub on them making them look dirty.
B00CXVHV0Q|5|Love this bumper. I have the Sweet JoJo set already. I wish it had been included in the set because there were other things included that I won't use but I'm glad I found this. Alot of children's crib sets are gaudy and super colorful and cartoonish. This is very elegant and understated. Good quality as well!
B000CNOIQ2|5|This thing is amazing.  Easy to use, very convenient, and works with a variety of wipes.  We didn't like the Babyganics wipes in it, because they won't come through the hole in the top each time, but the others work great.  The wipes also stay warm for a bit, so you don't have to rush to use them before they get cold.  Has a bit of condensation inside, so if you aren't using daily, it will leave a brown mark on the wipes.  We have one upstairs in the nursery, but have a changing station set up downstairs and haven't brought the warmer downstairs to use it there yet.  So that's how I know about the brown. Very strange.  But a nice thing.  Definitely a luxury that is worth it.
B0007TZZVS|5|I bought this car seat for my 3 year old when it was on sale for $60.  I felt this car seat met and exceded my expectations of a car seat in that price range.  The headrest is somewhat more narrow but I feel my son's head is better protected in the event of an accident.  It also can recline for seats that recline so it's a great fit in my mini-van.  This also is a big help when he wants to nap while I am driving.  The only drawback is that the cup holders are too shallow to keep any kind of cup upright without tipping over and falling out.  I am pleased with this seat and feel that it was a good choice and a great value.
B00K80DFUY|5|Wife has light triggered migraines. Has worked to knock out major direct sunlight.
B00000J4SP|5|I love that this toy is black, white and red.  The colors are great for little minds, in fact, that is what first attracted me to this toy.  After I got it, I was so glad that I decided to get it.  My play gymini is being used for a second time...we have a new baby and I still like this gym better than any other brand on the market right now.  I think its design is far superior to other models I have seen.  It is great!  So durable, and the babies love to look at the toys and stare at the black and white stripes and polk-a-dots.  The toys are soft and safe.  The musical toy does need an adult to press it for the music to start.  The arches are attatched at the top with a snap and then attatched to each corner with snaps.  The snap at the top of the arch can be unsnapped quickly so that the arches fold down and lay flat on the floor or all the snaps can be unsnapped and the arches will actually come off of the mat altogethere. So, with the arches folded down or detatched, the mat can be used for diaper changes or a sleeping mat etc.  You always have a clean, soft place to lay baby when you are out at grandma's or wherever.  The toy is very easy to take along for travel, just fold it up and go.  Oh, and the mat washes up easily...Just unsnap the arches and throw it in the washing machine.  <BR>     You can also purchase other toys to dangle from the arches and you can purchase extra hanging rings which allow you to extend the toys as low as you want...however, I like the toys just as they are.
B00I0M8RUA|5|Great first sippie cup. This is a nice first sippie cup. I like that the handles are so big and soft because it is easier for baby to grip. The nipple part is really halfway between a bottle and the hard plastic sippie cups made for the older children, making it easier to transition. It doesn't have BPA, which is very important. It likes the ounces and the ml on it, too, which I felt was a nice extra feature. Holding five ounces it is a good size for little ones to hold on their own. I would recommend this cup.
B004VL2VRY|1|At first I loved the baby monitor (MBP 34 - similar to 33). It allowed me to see sleeping baby in very very dark room. However, after ten days the video no longer reliably works. The screen goes so dark you cannot see baby at all for a few hours, then the image inexplicably pops up again. It looks like the camera's night and day modes don't get triggered properly at day/night transitions. Anyway, I'm now in the process of contacting Motorola, but my hopes about good customer service are pretty low given other reviewers' comments. Will update this review, but given what we paid for this camera I am already really really mad.<br />---<br />Motorola would exchange it but that would take 2 weeks. I just returned it to the store where we bought it, and bought a Summer Infant instead. Hopefully that will work.<br />---<br />OMG the Summer infant is WAAAAY superior. Image is crystal clear compared to the Motorola.
B00DNBA82S|2|Color and picture very low quality and night vision unable to see anything clear, almost non existant
B00E1ABYSC|5|I was reluctant based on reviews but I absolutely love this! I have a 3 year old and an 18 month old and these work great in the britax car seats as well as other brands!  We were on a long trip and my three year old (is fully potty trained) fell asleep and had an accident and it was only in the cover! I did a happy dance not having to pull out the carseat and disassemble to wash! Where was this 3 years ago!
B003069Z9S|5|Works very well.  Just follow the instructions to sterilize your items.
B004DFO57M|5|Out of all the stuff we bought in anticipation for our baby, these little scissors have been one of my best purchases. I use them once or twice a week and it makes trimming baby nails so much easier than attempting with traditional-style clippers.
B004G8QN6M|5|We love our sleep sacks. We like the flannel sleep sacks as it allows our baby to stay warm without us having to turn up the heat over 72 which is too hot for us. This way everyone is comfortable. We use this for naps and sleeping through the night. We started to use the sleep sacks when our baby would break out of his swaddle which was around 3 months. The first three months swaddling was great and then we transition to this product. This product has also held up to the washer and dryer without falling apart or shrinking. I recommend having two on hand in case of spit up or diaper accidents during the night.
B00003TKVX|5|I've used this product with all of my 4 children (2 of which are twins).  For my youngest, I tried one of the other systems with the small bassinet attachment and changing pad but he quickly outgrew it and he didn't like the confining walls so I switched back to this one.  It can be hard to pack up so I use it as a temporary crib for the early months when baby isn't sleeping through the night and I'm nursing.  It's a great compromise for nursing moms, the baby is not sleeping in your bed but yet he's not in a crib in another room.  This co-sleeper is worth the extra money!
B00ECHYTBI|5|The best baby purchase I made! I purchased this monitor and an additional camera for the living room. I don't have an open floor plan so bring able to watch my daughter play while I'm working in the kitchen is great. The sound quality is clear and it is very sensitive to sounds. I don't even turn it all the way up. I also use a wind/sound machine in the room and have no issues with audio quality. The picture quality is very good too. I love being able to move the camera around and zoom in to see my daughter more closely and also like the voice feature so I can let her know I'm coming if she is especially upset or if I am going to be detained for a moment before I make it into her room. I had the original unit that had issues with the USB port and it did break as other reviewers have noted, but their customer service was amazing and shipped me out a replacement right away. This new model has corrected this defect so don't hesitate to buy it. I have a split floor plan ranch style house and have had no issues with signal except for a temporary drop if I am playing on my phone directly in front of the display unit (within a foot or so). At night I charge my phone right next to the unit on my nightstand and have no problems. The new unit also does not make the loud beep like the older model, but I never had a problem with that anyways. It's not like you carry it into the babies room and turn it on while they are sleeping,  not sure why that bothered people so much. Either way, the newer model fixed that too. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this monitor, and if you were to have any issues they have real live customer support just a phone call away.
B00067AEGC|5|First off...you can't give it a bad review if you didn't even use it or if you didn't read the box.  It isn't portable or shouldn't be.  It's a suspension gate.  It's like two shower curtain rods with a soft mesh between them.  We have it in the opening between our living room and kitchen.  And we have to climb over it CONSTANTLY, but for the price and size, I can't complain.  For the money, it does the job.  It holds up against a pretty determined one year old, and keeps her from hurting herself at the stove or dishwasher.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*Price<br /><br />*The soft mesh feels better when my 1 year old crashes head first into it.<br /><br />*It holds up when my 1 year old crashes into it.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-It's not something you can take down and put back up easily (one handed) in high traffic areas.<br /><br />For an inexpensive gate that keeps my baby safe, it's priceless.
B0031U0UI8|4|The footmuff is warm and made sturdy, the only issue I have with it is that there is not a lot if room in the foot area... Others than that its perfect!
B00JV8GUE2|5|Awsome pillow. I received a personal email asking how I liked the pillow. Who does that nowadays. I would buy and recommend it again
B007NG5UF4|2|The sound quality is good, and the range also but the lights sensor only turn on for loud sounds even if they are 5. It would be a quite nice device if it would not periodically  disconnect without any reason, especially in the middle of the night starting to beep. My unit are very close, only one wall in between and the battery charge or power connection does not help.
B00CXPYWCC|5|I love this system! As a nursing mom with a full-time job, the Kiinde system has really made the pumping/freezing/transporting process much easier. I love them and so does my daycare provider!
B004BU3CDW|5|the first time i used these they seemed a little tight, like they weren't flexing enough to get the pressure needed to pump. but after a about 30 seconds they work great! i would definitely recommend as they are way cheaper!
B0038JDUDE|4|Just started using this at 22 months and have no trouble with spillage.  Baby used sippy cups until around a year and probably around then switched mostly to straw style. Haven't really been too concerned about switching to a big kid style cup since i loathe the clean up required, so 22 months seemed like a good age. To all the people complaining that their 11 months old have major spilling with this cup, suggest you wait till, uh, they are ready to use a big kid cup. What's the rush? They can't possibly understand water/gravity at that age, let alone have the dexterity to keep a cup upright all the time.
B003HC8622|5|this is a really cool walker, it seems to be well made and quality material.  I bought this at Baby Depot (part of Burlington Coat Factory) for $39.99, I was happy to find it cheaper but I would have paid the amazon price for it!!!<br /><br />Some reviews said this walker is too tall for their kid, my daughter is 6 months and can touch the floor while in it... but my daughter is also in the 85 percentile for height too.
B009QP3RSC|5|Other than costing more than what I would have paid in a local retail store (didn't know they had it) this is a very nice car seat.
B007ZBVD0S|4|Little hard to get my daughters hands through the elastic at the wrist, but it does the job once it is on!!<br /><br />Has held up after being washed at least twice a week for 2 months now.
B0002HYESU|5|My grandson played with it from the first moment!  It is very well done, wooden pieces are comfortable for his hands, and there are patterns that he liked. I highly recommend this mosaic!
B000O7SNIK|5|My baby loves soft sheets, so this was ideal for him! It is extremely soft and comfortable. Wish I had some like these for my bed! lol
B00GHAH12M|4|I really like it. I wish they offer more colors other than light pink and blue. The light pink gets dirty so quickly, but I love the room inside of it.
B000CSBP3G|4|not used yet, it's too hard for baby's neck
B000KO81QG|5|Bought these letters thinking that they were larger than they were, however they worked out great in the end!  Love them!
B00P84L692|2|Was disappointed for what I received for the price. All it is is a long piece of fabric with the ends sowed together. I could have made it myself for a cheaper price.
B004L2JJAA|5|I was given a baby mirror to affix to my rearview mirror several years ago, and after it had finally lost it's sticky, i realized I had to buy another one for my continued safe driving. I read all the reviews and was resigned to this product because it resembled my old one.  When the mirror arrived, the first feature that impressed me was the clarity of the mirror.  I had gotten used to the \\"fun house\\" quality of my previous one and figured it was to be accepted.  Not this one.  It has NO distortion and is slightly \\"fish-eyed\\" so you can see the entire rear seat without tilting your head.  I have two car seats in the back and I can see my children's entire bodies, so I know when little sister thwacks her big brother.      I know that the visor attachment is meant for the front seat, but I used the suction cup just under the rearview mirror.  I had to take my eyes off the road to check the mirror on the visor.  I think losing a tiny bit of visibility is worth keeping my eyes on the road.    The most important feature is it's heat resistance.  I live Florida and I've had the mirror in my car since the beginning of August and it hasn't budged or warped in our hot summer sun.  I can only speak for the suction cup attachment, but I doubt the visor attachment is a different design.    If you don't have the same experience I did,  you might have gotten a defective one.  Send it back.  Vendors prefer happy customers that write positive reviews.    Update on this mirror.  It is now 2014, and my 5 and 7 year old are still suffering from Mom knowing exactly what is going on in the back seat.  I am still driving (and parking) in the Florida heat, and it has not fallen off.  Sometimes, when the ball joint get bumped, I have to fiddle with it to get it into a position where it stays put, but once I readjust the mirror properly, it is fine.  The clarity of the mirror is also still perfect, despite effects of time and heat.  The product recommends placing the mirror in the back seat or on the visor, but just under the rear view mirror really is the best placement.     I'll concede that perhaps quality has changed over the years, but usually quality is tied to batches in production, so every few months the quality of goods can vary wildly, especially in Chinese manufacturing (which is why amazon reviews are so all-over-the-place).  If you get a bad product, always contact the manufacturer personally and they are pretty good about hand selecting a product in good condition.
B008VUZ8MQ|5|I purchase this adorable Puff the Magic Dragon &#34;jack&#34; in the box for my 15 month old daughter along with the board book and the stuffed animal. The illustrations are the same as the illustrations in the board book, which was a huge plus. I love that it plays the song Puff the Magic Dragon. It is made of tin, and I received one with a dent the first time. Without any hassle, Amazon sent out a new one that arrived in excellent condition. All three of my children ages 15 months to 8 years old enjoy playing with it. This trio (the book, stuffed animal, and Jack in the Box) will be my new go to toddler gift.
B001BKXV5E|5|I had a very difficult time getting my daughter to take any bottle.  I got these from amazon.com after reading the reviews and had great results.  My daughter not only took several ounces but took formula from these bottles and is still using them several months later.  These have been a life saver.  I think the design of the nipple is easy for her to manage and she can hold it easily herself now at 8 mos.  As for the multiple parts, they are kind of a pain and you have to get the bottle together perfectly or it leaks.  This is a very small inconvenience compared to the success we have had with these bottles and I am so glad we found them.
B000LJER7C|5|I bought this stroller for my six month old son and he LOVES it: so does his mommy :-)  It maneuvers beautifully and has full wind and sun protection.  We had a Britax lightweight stroller and it was a horrible ride with no protection or padding.  He loves honking the horn and listening to tunes with the speakers from my ipod. The pockets and storage are great and it looks cool too.
B00CXPYWCC|5|These are great for storage as well as feeding! They can stand up straight on their own, lie down flat, freeze and defrost easily. Before, I was storing milk in regular freezer bags then transferring to a bottle for feeding. This eliminates that step, plus I don't waste any milk in the transfer. My son loves the bottles as well. Only thing that I don't love is that the measurements in the bag seem off. I always pump into other containers first, and the amount of liquid I get there is different than what it shows in these bags (the bags overestimate the volume). But overall will not use any other bottle or storage system!
B00F0ZXBII|5|My 8 month old baby will not sleep without this! We ended up buying her two, so she would have a back up. Super soft!
B00OFGWQLQ|4|They came in pretty quickly and were very tasty
B004GSOHNS|1|Poorly made & constructed.
B00TSBGDZS|5|The Avent pacifiers are great, the only drawback is you can't really clip them like the kind with a hoop.  We bought a stroller attachment that holds 2-3 of these just fine though.  They also sell plastic covers that can be attached a clip.  Keep in mind you are never to clip a pacifier around a babies neck.<br /><br />We use all Avent products here including their bottles and their natural nipples.
B008BGNT4E|4|Very wide. Need a lot of room. Ended up using it in the driveway.
B00081J3N6|5|I got these as an add on and they were very cheap.  I couldn't believe I was getting 36 stoppers for only 2 dollars.  Seem to be good quality.  However you do know they are in the plug they kind of stick out like a sore thumb, but hey now my child is safe and can't stick her finger in the outlet.  Do not get if you do not want them to be noticed.
B000OS8BP4|5|Couldn't agree more with the prior headline! This product works so much better than any nasal aspirator I tried. At five weeks old, my baby girl caught a cold that lasted three weeks. After a week and a half of the regular bulb aspirator, I ordered this product and it made all the difference. She screamed when I would use the bulb aspirator but doesn't mind this little contraption at all. This is a must-have baby product and I will be giving this for shower gifts from now on!<br /><br />*I ordered this from the Nosefrida website because it cost less than on Amazon.
B000XT30G4|5|I ordered this gate after my Rottweiler tore down a different one.  My husband installed this and I don't know how we managed before.  Awesome gate and it looks very nice and like it is meant to be part of the house.  Very well made and definitely recommended!!
B007H0SFZI|3|It served it's purpose.  The baby was folded over, and the pacifiers had to be cut out.  Did not like that.
B004XOK0OA|3|Was quick to arrive. It was for a Christmas present so we did not experience putting it together or seeing it after it was together.
B00AGMBOXY|5|better quality than plastic ones
B0010CD2IO|4|I bought these because my toddler likes to close our bedroom door all the time. I was sure that as he got a little older, he'd also enjoy locking the door, and opening the door when no one's looking. Thanks to this, he can't get to the lock (but you can) and he can't open the door. Visiting children struggle to open this knob, and it is quite amusing. The doorknob we have on said door is apparently on the smaller side as there's still space inside for a slightly larger knob. We're still able to use this though. Basically you squeeze each side and turn to open as normal. The center grey piece can open to expose the lock (if there is one), but ours got pushed in and I haven't bothered to try and get it back out as we never lock the bedroom door. All in all, if you think you're going to have a troublesome toddler, like us, then I suggest investing in this and saving yourself the headache later.
B005GDW49Q|5|Even though these are expensive they were worth every penny.  We have been trying to potty train my grandson for over a year and these finally did the trick.  They are very comfy and easy for him to get on and off.
B0032B500O|5|J'ai acheté cette balancoire portative il y environ 2 mois. Je l'adore, elle est effectivement très silencieuse et ma fille peut dormir dedant toute la matinée. Le jouet est un peu drabe, mais j'ai accroché d'autres jouets plus colorés à côté. Je n'ai pas encore changé les batteries et je l'utilise au moins 2 à 3 heures par jour. On peut la mettre par terre ou sur une table.
B004CCRA4G|5|I love the lifefactory products and was excited to see that they make a teething ring.  Good width even for y 2 month old to be able to hold on to.  Love the color which is a little brighter than the image pictured.
B004BSFC6E|5|I sent this to my grandson for his 1/2 birthday and it was a huge hit.  Rusty is a nice size and my grandson can easily grab onto the toy...it is also a nice soft material with many different parts to keep babies occupied.  Good Job Lamaze!
B00M6N6UO4|5|I purchased this for the grand baby. My daughter had a different feeder on her wish list but I read the reviews on this and decided to take a chance and order something that wasn't on her list. It is easy for my granddaughter to hold and chew on. It's a breeze to clean.
B0039UULYS|5|I have been looking at a lot of baby print frames for my second son. Most of the ones I found were not my style, but this one caught my eye. It is simple and stylish, and I love the fact that you have a hand print, foot print, and the babies photo all in one frame. It looks great hanging on the wall and is very well made. I wish I would have found this one for my first sons prints so I could have had matching frames. Great buy totally worth the price.
B0035JL90I|1|This item is terrible, water seeps in so your poor baby is made heavy by their wet diaper.  Wrap a plastic bag around their butt and it wood have the same effect.
B00S06XFVC|5|my niece thought I was cruel, but uses them anyway
B001DWG3V4|4|I use this for diapers and wipes downstairs so they aren't just everywhere. It comes in handy and looks pretty good. I can fit a good amount of diapers and other supplies in it. I usually don't use all the extra pockets though. The carry handle is nice and it's a good size.
B005GGACJW|5|I bought one for myself and wanted to give one to my each of my two daughters so they would have pictures of their babies to share.  I really like have the 4 folders and being able to store 4000 pictures.  It is so easy to use.  I had a hard time finding something I could have in my purse without printing.<br /><br />Of the 3 units I received, one was defective.  I wanted to have it replaced, however, they are now unavailable.  I'm still looking for one more.<br /><br />I would recommend this and hope I will find one soon.  Many people I showed mine to loved it also.  There is a demand, just no supply.
B00F2MQ2BW|5|From the first time was daughter went in this jumper she has had fun. Easy to put together and easy to adjust. The colors are vibrant and the sound level is adjustable. She loves the lights and spinning toys. I think this will be even better when she starts wanting to walk.
B00CA88XXQ|5|They are great
B002YQU4TK|5|Awesome toy. My son (3 year old now) has been playing with it for 1.5 years now and still hasn't lost interest. In contrast, his interest in most other toys lasts for about 5 minutes!!! Also, very simple but interesting toy that lets the child exercise his/her own imagination, which is probably what makes it so interesting.
B0040K4IZE|5|Same material as the GroVia Shell and is great for a quick grab wet bag.  Compared to other wetbags, in my opinion, these are great because they &#34;crumple up&#34; and don't take up any room in the diaper bag.  I have even used it as a diaper bag when in a rush.
B001Q3L8RY|4|My son really enjoys these. I bought them for him at about 20 months when some of our other &#34;squirt&#34; bath toys got icky. As other reviewers noted, these can be hard for little kids to fill and squirt by themselves, but my son loves taking them apart and putting them back together. He also loves just pouring water from one to the other (with lids off). They seem durable and easy to clean if needed.
B000VZKGYY|4|Makes a nice canopy of stars with a moon, the blue and green light will cover ceiling and walls of a large size room, the red just reflects on the ceiling and is less impressive, but at the same time it gives the room a warm atmosphere.<br />It changes colors manually and turns off automatically after 45 minutes.<br />I think is a bit pricey for so little features, but it is worth it when the reaction to the blue light of my 2 year old daughter was looking around and exclaimed :\\"wooooow!!!\\"
B006I0R5HC|5|Hard to find slim neck bottles but these are great. I use for both feeding and pumping directly into bottle. Definitely recommend.
B002UD8L2O|4|I bought this as a \\"tummy time\\" blanket for my little one. Right now it works fine, since she can't scoot, but I do wish it were just a tad bit bigger.
B005ZNCEPQ|5|Love this insert! I got my diaper bag pretty cheap and it was just like a purse, all open. So when I thought about organizing it, I looked online and found this. LOVE the fact that I can take it out and change my bag up when I feel like I need a change. Turn any purse/hand bag into a diaper bag !
B00006H3D8|5|I have read all the reviews for this seat because I am very interested in buying the tan version. I have noticed that a person calling themselves ~a baby enthusiast~ is the author of almost every bad review.  I personally have decided to disregard these reviews.  Just thought everyone should realize that.
B00CLHDKD4|5|This blanket is so soft and wonderful.  When my baby was first born, this blanket went everywhere with us.  She napped wrapped up in it in our arms, she played on it on the ground, we used it in the stroller.  It was great.  Now that it is summer, we use it less, but it is packed away in the closet for the fall.  After using it nearly every day, there is almost no visible signs of wear. I am sure we will be using this blanket for many years with all our children.
B007MV0YMO|3|I received this as a baby shower gift and was so excited to use it. It did bounce alone and vibrate and my son enjoyed it.  I think, obviously the lighter the infant, the more impressive the bouncing so your average 7lb infant could probably get a lot better/longer use out of this bouncy seat. My son was 10lbs and 22 inches at birth so he quickly grew out of it. The seat didn't bounce that well under his weight after about 3 weeks.<br />PROS:<br />The seat is pretty upright- very good to set your child in after a bottle if they have reflux problems.<br />The bouncy seat is quiet-even the vibration.<br />I never had to replace the batteries.<br />Cute neutral design<br />It bounces itself!<br /><br />CONS:<br />You can't take the seat cover off to wash it. Only head pads are removable.<br />The bouncing could be a little better-but it still beats doing the foot bounce.
B00D6AAXIK|5|So cute. Came right on time for pictures
B000069RAO|1|I placed an order for a new mother on  or about August 3, 2006. It was available at the time I ordered it and received this confirmation:  <br />  <br />Shipping estimate for these items:  August 15, 2006 - August 22, 2006 <br />Delivery estimate:  August 17, 2006 - August 25, 2006  <br />  <br />1 \\"Boppy Luxe Nursing and Infant Support Pillow, Clouds\\" <br />Baby Product; $34.99 <br /> <br />I received two notifications asking me if I wanted to cancel and constantly delaying shipment. <br /> <br />This is now September 18, 2006 and no end in site. I have yet been given a reason why it was showing available at time of order and not not available.  I am still waiting. <br /> <br />
B005UV0UEA|5|Love it so easy to set up and fold it.
B009YSYCZI|5|This pump made my life so much easier, I was using a manual before. I like the fact the milk never comings into contact with the parts that connect it but you can still remove them and clean them when you want to since they are just plastic.<br /><br />My pump also came with lots of freebies like an extra zip up purse as well as the bag it comes in which is actually a perfect nappy bag size, and lots of day and night nursing pads which are some of the nicest pads I've used!<br /><br />It took me a while to find out if I would be able to use this in Australia and you can, the plug can be used on up to 240v sockets. But be aware the warranty isn't valid outside of the USA I have lots of Phillips products so I wasn't worried.
B0046N26YU|5|Our daughter LOVES this toy.
B003CK3LDI|5|We also have the monkey, we bought this one first and liked/used it so much we bought a second to keep at daycare/around this house.
B00DIKR1TW|5|This s great for a baby to toddler. I got it for my 8 month niece who loves unicorns - as she should. It comfy and helps her dry off. She's learning to swim, so this is great for afterward and looks cute on her.<br /><br />Plus, it's super adorable. Pink, check! Unicorn, check!,<br /><br />Auntie duties DONE!
B00O0AAB5U|5|Gift
B00005BX4Z|1|The clips did not stay attached for very long. Would not recommend this product.
B0006BAJIQ|1|Like many of the other posters, the toy bag does not stick to our bathroom wall. This is very frustrating because when it is full of toys and it falls off the wall it makes a loud noise and a big mess. It falls off the wall even when it is empty, which is still annoying because it should stay on the wall. <br /> <br />The other issue I had was the blue dye on the fabric bled onto many of the soft plastic toys or sponges.
B000PC5KNA|5|Excellent Item.
B0041IIG6C|5|I bought these bags for a trip, knowing that they would be helpful in case we had any \\"poopy-dos\\" while traveling. The bags were great for diapers and much more. They were handy on the plane for any garbage created until a crew member could come along to collect. They were also great for soiled clothes until they could be washed.<br /><br />They hold a lot more than just a dirty diaper. In fact, you could probably fit two in the bag easily and still tie it shut tightly.<br /><br />The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming, unless you stick your nose in the bag they come in and take a big sniff. One bag on its own is just enough to assist in the concealing of diaper odors, but not something a bystander would even notice.<br /><br />For the price they are a steal. I recently had to contain a foul smelling \\"poopy-do\\" and could actually place it in one of these bags and throw it away in the house. Usually I would need to take it directly outside to the trash can. A lot less spendy then a diaper genie approach, which I hear are not all that great.<br /><br />Ultimate, if you get these I am sure you will find more that the single intended use for them as I did. Looking forward to seeing how else they might be of use as I have so many bags to go through that hardly cost me anything to purchase. For the price give them a try.
B006BZETX2|5|This bag is very cute if you are having a baby boy. It is a good size for travel.. a little bit bigger than a purse. It is very cute. I am giving it as a gift for a baby shower.
B0057ECYS0|5|very good
B00KWR2BCQ|5|The kiddo loves this!!!!!! Perfect size for him and super soft
B00J9SBVW0|5|My son absolutely loves it
B000YDXP2I|4|This bag does the job. It is stylish and doesn't scream &#34;I'm a diaper bag&#34;. It is not the largest which my wife does not really like. When you put things in the small outer pouches it pushes into the cavity of the main bag and decreases its usable space. I like that it is not too big because I know that she would fill the diaper bag no matter what the size. This forces her to bring only what we need and saves my shoulder from a heavy bag.
B002BY1S5E|5|This was a gift for a friend who just loves anything with elephants, bright green colors, and artsy stuff.  This fit the bill on all 3 counts, and needless to say she loves it.
B0035CHO5O|5|Loved it!
B00AY4WWR6|5|Items came right on time. And was exactly what i expected
B001CCHUTE|5|Love this product. It i light enough for summer, but offers a discreet way to nurse in public.
B000LBETP0|5|The product is exactly what I needed.  It is lightweight and easy to fold up.  The only part that I would change is the sun shield.  They should have made it extend out more.  It is too short.  Other than that, I am happy with this purchase.
B0051GJ60S|5|Very high-quality for pressboard (especially for the price, wow) and very easy to assemble. Really glad I got them, they look perfect.
B000H1IYXW|5|Works on very thick King Bed.  Assembly took a few minutes but fortunately you only have to do it once.
B007IUYMUE|5|This is the perfect activity zone for my almost five month old. It is smaller in size compared to others and I love that since I have twins and space is limited when you have two of these things going at once.
B00K9QNP8E|5|adorable mat is nice quality - not flimsy or too thin.
B000XY0N0U|2|I bought this for Christmas for my son and was really excited to receive it. However, when I received it, half of the horns dont make a sound when you honk them, and the ones that did work were really weak. I was so disappointed, because the concept is great and it is so cute. What a shame.
B009UPUFCY|1|wheni recieved this item iw as excite although some what CONCERNED because they stuffed it in a box with BOX cookie mix making one side heavy and make the munchkin smashed in its box. i aws completely upset and asked for a refund. we are going to try ONCE more and hole the second time it comes back WORKING!!!! because our daugher doesnt fall asleep easily and loves the vibration in her bassinet and so we wanted to try this.... we will give you one more chance.....................
B00K5KVC52|5|Thank you! Everything was perfect
B00IHDL8A8|5|I bought this beautiful rose-patterned blanket for my daughter, Rose. It was the<br />PERFECT prop to use for her 6 month pictures!<br /> Also, I LOVE the minky fabric on its reverse...it is so soft!
B0049U5UGG|5|I have two of this storage cubbys in the living room for my daughters toys, books and shoes. It's great to have something for her that goes with the living room feel.
B00081MHJI|5|This product is one of those items that you'll never know you need until that one time you do.  It was easy to install and it seemed sturdy to do its job.
B002MN3JY2|3|I bought 3 packs of these to rotate through as I breastfed because whichever breast baby girl isn't feeding on will leak as she nurses. They work pretty well but will leak through to your shirt pretty quickly. They are kind of thick so I tend to only wear them in the house or overnight- you can see them through a lot of shirts. I like that they are reusable and washable- but a handful of them got lumpy after washing them (like the cotton became bunched up inside). I've been using them for 11 months though so they were worth the money for me!
B0058MITP8|5|Indispensable for potty training.  They have proven waterproof for us, and are durable in the wash.  I love the old trick of layering sheet-pad-sheet so that the kids' beds have 5 layers of bottom sheets & pads at any time. When they wet their beds in the night, it is nice to whip off the top most sheet & pad and have a dry, clean layer underneath.  For that reason, I'm glad this sit on top of the mattress, instead of being fitted.  The extra layers of sheets are bulky enough already.<br /><br />They also cover the entire surface.  My daughter stays put in one spot during the night, but my son rolls all over the bed.  I had one of those banded ones that only covered the middle of the bed, and it was useless to me.
B0046DOYIQ|5|I bought this one for my 3 year old son who loves cars.  He was so delighted that he pointed out all the cars on the sheet and won't sleep on any other \\"replacement sheet\\" when I do laundry.  The fabric is 60% cotton and 40% polyester and was softer than I thought it would be.  The pillow case seems thicker than the sheets and fits a standard pillow.  I eventually will upgrade to twin sheets when he transitions to a larger bed but for now these are a great pair.  I do wish it had come with a flat sheet so I could try to get my son to sleep under the covers instead of on them!  I also wash in warm water with no problems with bleeding or fading colors.
B004A5TTMQ|4|I initially ordered the door hanging ones for cloth diapering full time.  As other reviews have said - it leaves a lot of water inside the bag after the wash.  If you watch for it and can manage it, it's not big deal... personally it was just a pain for me so I opted for the large size instead of the door hanging ones.  The large is quite large and for us we could hold 2 days of full time cloth diapering in the large.  The door hanging one would be 3 days worth in our house (diapering one little boy).<br /><br />I tried to use the front zippered part for diaper covers that didn't get soiled but were ready for a wash and that made the bag bulky and awkward.<br /><br />All considered, it's a great bag it just didn't quite work as well as the large size will for us.
B00EBCEP6I|5|Super cute and much more affordable than most trendy baby sheets.  They coordinate well with the bedskirt and crib bumper I purchased elsewhere.
B0052VNQR6|5|I'm not a big fan of pack n plays because they are a pain to set up, so I only use it when she's needs a place to sleep over for maybe a few days, but for everyday use or visiting a friend's house, I use this thing the most. It's folds easy and washes easily. Its fool proof. It's comfy as well. I like to sit on it with my daughter while playing. I wish it came in a different prints, but this one is gender neutral which I like. I'm very glad I purchased this.
B001R1SOSG|5|i have tried avent, dr. brown's, you name it, i have bought them. it was only until i tried first year's breastflow bottle that my baby finally was happy to continue w/my breastfeeding and switch over to the bottle at the same time. its designed to help w/moms who breastfeed and bottle feed at the same time. my baby will not take to any other bottle besides this bottle and she loves it and so do i. i highly recommend this bottle.
B000056HNV|5|Super soft and comfortable for the baby!!!
B00003TL7P|5|Diaper Champ is the best.  Easy to use - even with just one hand.  I have a Diaper Genie too, but Champ is better!  My only complaint is that the diapers don't seem to fill the whole bag -it will seem as if it's full, but the bag is only 1/2 full when I open it up.
B00IR4F3LM|3|I thought that this was an amazing idea for our car seat. It fell short of my expectations.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Colorful<br />- Lots of items to grab<br />- Objects make different sounds and rattles<br />- Slides over easily when carrying the seat<br /><br />Cons:<br />- High in the air, hard for my little one to reach.<br />- The picture showed that it was not tightly wound around the handlebar. But I can't get ours to loosen up<br /><br />Overall, I really like this product and I hope that maybe over time it will loosen up a little and stretch out so it can go across the handle. Right now it is all gathered in one spot and all the toys are scrunched together. For my first child, I had individual toys hanging from the top; and I might switch back to that because at least it hung a little lower and they were spaced apart.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this again, but I think that the idea is excellent.
B00XB7MAYS|5|Love that it is light and breathable.
B0057L8UOU|4|Love it
B00X7FHMCE|1|Wow. So, the back of this 'safety seat' is holding your child in with Velcro. Velcro, people. This is not safe or legal for use in a car.
B007JVX47E|4|Purchased this car seat base separately as an extra to go inside the husband's car and the car seat snaps right into it perfectly! Also it's easy to install!
B0000A340I|5|I am a Child Care Provider and one of my clients came in with a Bundleme in her child's car seat and I thought what a great idea. I never saw one of those. So I went online and found them and low and behold I bought 3 because I have 3 babies. I am buying 3 more for the stroller I have. They are the best thing since the baby activity centers. Plus it makes an old 24 year old, 3 seater stroller seats, look new again. I couldn't beat the price on the Bundleme in any store near by so that's why I got them online, it was also free shipping.

B00MW6ZRUI|5|I bought thes diapers as a gift. The family are delighted with them.
B00AWLZDYU|5|Awesome bags. I've been using these for three months and haven't had a leak yet.
B004AHMCLY|5|The nubby blue ball in the set is one of the most fought-over toys in the house.  I have no idea why, but it is.  The other two balls in the set are also well-played with.  I call that a win.
B00L2FPBXS|4|They appear to be real amber. They have imprefection that seem to be consistent with showing authenticity. The quality of the neclace meets my satisfaction. My one year old wears daily. I was concerened about purchasing this necklace online because of all the reviews on amazon about different brands being fakes. But as i stated in the beginning that they appear to be authentic, but i am not an expert either.
B000CSBOBO|5|Fits perfectly on our toilet and is easy for our 23-month-old daughter to sit on securely. She can even put it on the toilet herself.
B00190JTAM|5|I bought this play yard to use for our first born. The assembly took about 10 mins and the whole system is very sturdy.  My opinion is that the actual colors look better than in the pics.  For the price I thought this was a very nice product. The changing table is removable and also seems sturdy. We set this up in our bedroom for the baby's first few months, but it's nice to buy something that will last and grow with her. The only downside: you do have to remove the mobile and changing table to collapse the yard. And we can't fit the playyard through the bedroom doorway when it's fully expanded, so it's not very portable set up with everything attached.  But as just a playyard, I could fold it up and fit it into the bag without assistance. Overall I thought a great product for the price.
B009ZMPZKE|5|Luv my sons new blanket.
B001P5ORBC|4|Its all about the nipple, our daughter preferred the drbrown kind but our new born son could not get a proper latch on the varity of other alternatives we tried including drbrown. We noticed while in the nursury our son preferred the NUK orthodontic nipple (zero sleep the first night home, went out the next morning to buy the NUK). There was an immediate difference in how he took the bottle, and so far so good tonight! YAY!!    As far as this NUK orthodontic nipple goes, NOTE there is a UP and DOWN side to the nipple, the air vent should be ontop to prevent dripping (note the other reviews, because of this design it is possible to leak if wrong side up), additionally because of the orthodontic design it can prevent the flow if the nipple is collapsing which is especially easy to do with this nipple (again confirmed by myself and another review below). So care needs to be taken to make sure the feeding is going well. In comparison testing the nipple it appears to work better wrong side up, but then you have risk of leaking (shrug).    In the end its all about the nipple and which your baby prefers.    Update our son continues to have issue with the nipple not flowing due to pinch off. Otherwise this bottle is the only one he can take. As a work around we have to use the bottle wrong side up for feeding to be a success. If it were only a perfect world.
B000GELCVQ|2|Be forewarned - the description on the outside of the box says that the toy sewing machine runs on batteries or an AC adapter. But this item does not come with the AC adapter! You have to buy it separately!
B002TUTP1O|3|I really liked this for my daughter but it is super small! We had it at my dads house for when we visit and with 6months she refused to sleep in this because it was so small that she couldnt even roll over or turn.<br />We used it maybe 5times until she refused sleeping in it.i wish it would have been bigger.now we have to buy another one
B00171WXII|5|I couldn't live without one of this. I used them since my kids were three months old. They are 1 and 2 years old now.
B005SPZG5Q|5|I own the Baby Jogger Double City Mini and the one thing I don't like about it is the lack of cup holders.  I bought 2 of these and they are awesome!  They can attach to about 4 different places up by the handle bar (I didn't try them lower because my babies don't need them there).  I did not try folding it up with them on there, I will probably remove them first so they don't get broken.  But, they go on and off really easily.
B00CKF0SSC|5|I bought it when my son was 4 months. He was already moving around a lot & I figured he would start rolling soon. Sure enough he did! At first I looked at the bumbo seats, but they were just too small! I have a very chubby baby & this seat is perfect! We usually sit him when it's dinner time, when we're cleaning, doing dishes & he's a happy little baby. The only thing I wasn't able to figure out is how to strap him in. I've adjusted the belt many times but I figure it's because my baby is pretty big. I love the fact that you can so easily clean it with wipes or anything else. All in all its a great product to have for your little one!
B0076GWZI6|1|The light only worked for about a week and then the batteries died.  The batteries cost more than the product itself.  I was disappointed in this as my daughter really enjoyed having this as a small light in her room.
B00DNQS6Q8|5|Great Product
B000F1OQPO|4|We use these gates as baby and pet gates; they work pretty well.  They don't scratch your walls, unless you have big dogs like mine that like to jump up and lean against the gate (1001b lab mutt and 65lb lab).  That's due to my rotten dogs, though---no flaw of the gate.  I only gave 4 stars since the gate I received arrived slightly scratched and some of the zip-ties had already been cut.  The gate looked gently used which would be fine except I paid for a new unit.
B0038OLMXE|5|Finally located a gate that stopped our dog from jumping out of his area.  This gate will not allow a jumping dog any mesh or other covering that he can get his paws into to crawl over. The vertical bars stopped his ability to climb over this gate.  Simply put if you have a dog that can crawl over a gate this one will stop him.
B0087UUKHI|5|My son (3 months) loves watching this. It only plays one song though. I like that you can shut it off if you have wound it up and finished using it.
B003YDWU2Q|5|I bought this carrier when my baby was two weeks old and began using it immediately. It is by far my favorite of the carriers we tried (also used a Moby and a Snugli). The Paige fabric is cute, but neutral enough that my husband doesn't mind wearing it too. Despite near constant use for a couple of months, it is in really good shape (no pilling or fading or anything). It feels really secure. I think it is incredibly comfortable to wear, and I'm not exactly tough/strong. I can wear her for hours and not mind/hurt one bit. My daughter has always seemed quite comfortable and happy to be riding in the Beco. She wasn't super tiny (8 pounds at birth), so she fit in it pretty well from the get-go. Now, at four months, she and I are still comfy and happy with it, and I anticipate using it for a long, long time into the future. My husband does need a little help getting it on and off, but that's mostly because he isn't that used to it. I can get it on and off really easily and quickly. I've heard of people breastfeeding with the kid in the Beco, but I think that's a little tricky. I did it once, and we managed, but it wasn't easy to get everything and everybody all positioned appropriately, and I definitely needed a blanket over my shoulder to keep things all covered up.
B003TU83SE|5|Our ten month old uses them every day. We love the bright colors and the thickness; They are easy to clean.
B00007DWBH|3|A little known fact about the Graco SnugRide--you can use them without the base as a car seat, and it is every bit as safe (it actually seemed more secure to me).  The bases mainly provide convenience. <br /> <br />If you will take your baby equally in both cars, then by all means buy an extra base.  However, if you will use one vehicle as the primary baby transporter and the 2nd one only occasionally, save your money on this item.  You can still take baby in the carrier with the seatbelt, and you'll have one less thing to store once you move into the \\"big\\" carseat.
B001LKQRHI|5|I BOUGHT THIS FOR NEWBORN PHOTOGRAPHY AND WHEN IT CAME I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT BECAUSE IT WAS COMPRESSED IN A CUBE BUT AFTER A DAY OF IT SITTING OUT IT WAS PERFECT!
B00PFO3SNC|5|I have 4 little ones and I will tell you that I have used just about every carrier and sling known to man. I'm severely uncoordinated and so I found that most took forever to get used to using, the material was super thin or it took 4 people to get this one child in. Mamaway ring sling is completely different. The material is beautiful. It's thick while not be so heavy you are afraid your child will smother. I also live in Florida and it's summer, so that means that anything extra you have to carry needs to be light enough not to make you pass out from the heat.<br /><br />The rings do take a bit of getting used to but they were even easy enough for someone like me. They are plastic but are very strong and hold the material secure. There are plenty of videos that I watched to show how easy is it is to use. My 5 year old wanted to be carried around in it and while I was afraid that it would break, I was able to carry him for more than an hour and I'm happy to report that the sling is still going strong.<br /><br />I 100% recommend this for anyone that is looking for a good quality sling that won't break the bank!<br /><br />I received this free in exchange for my honest opinion.
B004FTQ9AW|5|cute
B005MQR96U|5|We purchased this seat for my tall 3.5 year old. She is forward facing, and will be able to remain in a 5 pt harness for a long time in this seat. It is very sturdy, and we are very pleased with it. She is pleased with the comfort and to color!
B00NH5DUXE|5|Love the fabric, same a swaddle blankets. However, it has 2 layers of fabric so it is little thicker which is great for a changing cover.
B00LF5VZP8|1|they were not what I expected.
B006NTY1HK|5|BEST play pen ever! We bought 2, it takes up the entire living room but its ok! Now that the baby is starting to climb up on things she uses the holes to grab onto and support herself.
B003457E16|4|Received as a gift.  It works, but you have to warm the plastic up first, to get it on the faucet.  It is hard to get over the faucet on our bathtub, the shower diverter pull is at the front of the faucet not near the wall.  When we turn the faucet on all the way, with the way the mouth of the frog is shaped, we end up getting water out of the tub because it sprays in almost a 180 degree arc.  But it works to prevent our son from hitting his head on the faucet.
B00B8EUDDQ|1|would not buy ever
B003OUWIJE|4|As my 4 month old exceeded the height maximum for his infant carrier, we needed to find a good car seat for a big infant.  We previously bought the Marathon for our daughter (who is now 3 yo) and loved it.  We went with the Roundabout because it was a good deal for a Britax seat.  Overall, I am very happy with it, and our baby is okay with it (he was happier in the infant seat).  It looks great, is soft, and had a removable insert for smaller children.  It's on the heavy side and isn't the easiest to take apart to clean...but those problems are worth having a super safe, American-made car seat!
B000XA6DC6|5|We used it to travel to NYC. My car seat fit in it perfectly and even had some extra room to store my son's pillows and blankets.<br />Would recommend to anyone.
B002EEO68M|5|Baby loves this at 6 months now n still using this without issues. I recommend MAM 0+ anticolic bottles to go along with the nipple. Never tried the advanced bottles after reading too many reviews of nipple collapsing while baby is feeding
B00P0A6OM8|4|Shades stick really easily to Windows.  It would be nice if they were a little bigger as they only cover about 2/3 of the Subaru back window.  It was a little tricky to figure out how to refold them at first.
B004QZBEFU|5|Great storage for baby's food! Perfect size for packing lunches for daycare. Love that it doesn't leak!!!
B00144JM14|1|The tip is too short and fat to fit in our baby boy's nose.  It has suction but is useless for our baby who is 7 weeks old.
B00KH8S32M|5|This mattress pad was recommended to me by a friend of mine.  Great, quality product and excellent seller.  I have found the pad to be very durable after countless washings and incredibly absorbent.
B006ZISQW0|4|Got this when my 15 month old granddaughter came to visit for a few weeks. It did the job, is easy to clean and store, attached securely to my dining room chair, and will work for several more years since it supports up to 50 lbs. She missed having a tray, but we solved that by using a large colorful &#34;Hello Kitty&#34; placemat on the table. It's not as sturdy and secure as her Fischer Price one she uses every day at home,  but for visits with Nonni it works just fine.
B00B7M7BKW|5|Good quality.  Very satisfied.
B002WRGGSY|5|I love this candle.  I had birth date candles for my own children 35+ years ago and we burned them every year.  Now I am buying them for my grandchildren.  We always make a big deal out of burning their candles on their birthdays.
B001QT4AR8|5|Non-toxic with no foul smell, bright colors and educational too.  What more can you ask for?  It is worth the extra money to get these Taiwan-made non-toxic squares than the cheap Chinese squares that will stink up the house and rub off on your child's skin.
B00BTZJCKE|2|Having bought wall decals for my older daughter's room, I had high expectations. Unfortunately these do not live up to the pretty picture on line. Very thin and cheap feeling. Two flowers ripped just by trying to remove them from the paper backing. The decals were shipped from CHINA (not kidding) so it took almost a month to get them. They look better than I feared on the walls, and you really can't tell how cheaply made they are. Overall, for a total investments of $6.26, I'd say &#34;it's better than a bare wall&#34;. When I find a better product I will be replacing them.
B001D7FZDQ|1|The description says mesh so I probably should have figured this, but I was not prepared for the material to be as lightweight, kind of like my older son's gym shorts, and with all the holes. I wish this size Halo was sold in the basic cotton like their smaller sizes. I took one look at these and boxed them back up.
B000WIEHH2|4|Pros:   Extra size and weight support  Ease of use   Little guy seems to be comfortable during the drive    Cons:  Have to be a little careful when the clip-in portion (which is made of metal)is released.  Little on the unwieldy side and needs the front seat on a mid-sized sedan (Honda Civic 2007) to be pushed well up front in order for the baby seat to fit in the back.   Some options such as loosening the straps not very intuitive
B003DQC72C|5|Got this as a gift for our son and it is amazing!!! It was amazing the difference in his drooling. It also helped with the pain associated with teething....at least I think that it did. His behavior changed for the better, He was not fussy after we put the bracelet on.
B00332FZUM|5|Yes, this walker is more expensive than most models.  But, it is money well spent.  First, you're getting two toys in one- a bouncer and a walker.  Second, it's very well designed and made with quality materials.  My 6 month old son loves it.  He loves cruising in it and playing with the activity tray.  Plus, the tray easily snaps off for easy cleaning.  And I love that I can control the volume on the activity tray.  All in all, a fun and well made product.
B00794BOIW|5|We love these blankets for swaddling because of the size and lightweight fabric.  The prints are very cute too, one white with monkeys, one white with green flowers, and one solid mint green.
B00829U5RY|5|My baby sleep well with this swaddle. I used to use NB size but he grew out of it and got this one.<br />He moves a lot and it's hard to keep his arms inside with regular swaddles. This one is very easy to wrap him up and change diaper. Highly recommend.
B009IWTNKY|5|This Playard is the perfect Addition to the rest of our disney lion king nursery. The placard is easy to put together and looks great!
B00CXSVZI8|1|ordered by mistake, it was not advertised very well.  I thought I was buying the entire chair not a tray.
B001U9OUYC|5|Comfortable, secure, contoured shape for baby. Safety strap so moms & dads don't have to worry about baby falling. All of my pad covers fit perfectly. What more could you ask for?
B00313JCSY|5|After a month, the receiving blankets you get from the hospital are too small!  This is the perfect swaddle cloth:  large enough to get the job done throughout the months of the baby's rapid growth and development.  And oh so soft, like t-shirt material.  And with just enough stretch in the fabric to tuck the baby into the swaddle just right.  It's been a life-saver, as our baby sleeps best (and longest!) when swaddled.  Enjoy!
B00FNJ7FSI|4|Normal
B007U15ZZM|4|I had high hopes for this item. My son used this walker from when he was about 4 months until 13 months. At first it was used as a stationary play station but within a couple months i converted it to a walker. To convert it to a walker, stoppers needed to be unscrewed so that the wheels would be able to be used. This was time consuming because there were quite a few stoppers. The positive thing about there being so many stoppers though is that in the stationary position, it was very stable.<br />My son loved the walker. He basically pushed forward to make the walker move. It did not encourage him to walk but it did encourage him to be mobile. The motions he used to move in the walker were much different than those he used when attempting to walk.<br />I bought this walker because I liked that there were only a few items for him to play with but there was a downside to this. He was quickly put off by the lack of toys and wanted other toys to keep him occupied.<br />To convert the walker to one which he could push, was very easy. The seat was removed (which was great for when it needed to be washed.I found the product to be too big for this purpose. It was so large that it was so hard for him to maneuver around the apartment. He became quite frustrated about not being able to move about at his leisure.<br />This item is large and therefore the fact that it can fold down is nice. It can be placed to the side when not in use. When compressed it is still pretty big however, but does not take up as much space.<br />The walker is easy to clean. This too is a plus. When I bought this item, it was inexpensive and therefore a good buy.
B000MEB3GE|4|Really cool product.  Couldn't wait to receive it.  Love it.  It took some figuring out how/when to best use the timers.  It seems you can either use it to count down for example when baby last had a diaper change, etc., but if you set a timer for that same event, it erases your previous time when the timer goes off.  Biggest thing:  DON'T DROP IT!!!  I mistakenly had it clipped to my belt thinking that the belt clip would hold it.  I bent down to pick something up, it popped off, hit the floor, and landed it some way so that it broke the back-light button.  Took it apart thinking it would pop back out only to find that nothing would work whatsoever when we screwed it back together.  I liked the product enough though to order another one.  I intend to give these as gifts for baby showers with the caveat to not drop them.
B0000479VK|1|I have about an inch and a half of space between my lazy susan and the adjacent bank of drawers.  If I install this lock, the base of it will block one of the drawers from opening.  It also means that I would have to drill into the formica trim on the cabinet.  I'm returning it.
B006NWKDKG|5|This bag is beautiful! I ordered 6 different bags from Amazon, figuring I would keep 2, one for me and one for my husband. The one I kept for my husband has not left the house! In no way does it look like a man's bag, but my manly-man husband is proud to carry it. It is stylish and well made. Our daughter's room is pink and frilly, but this bag is not for her; it is for us to carry her stuff so I chose something more representative of our style. The dark orange geometric print and chocolate brown leather trim are accented beautifully by fuschia lining and changing pad. We get compliments on it everywhere we go!<br />We have had the bag for 2+ months now, and it looks brand new.<br />Easily holds 6+ sz 1 diapers, wipes, 2 bottles, 2 sleepers, changing pad, 2 burp cloths, a blanket, a book, lotion and diaper cream. There is a smaller pocket in front that is perfect for my wallet, keys and cell when we go somewhere and I don't want to bring a purse. The straps to attach to the stroller are lovely.<br />Did I say LOVE!? Yep, 3 times in the title.
B0000A1O7P|4|This was an affordable and practical purchase. My daughter fits great in it, and it was easy to install. I can take it off easily too. Messes are great to clean up as well
B00BQEGVMU|1|these shipped all warped as though they had been sitting in a warehouse in the hot hot sun for a long time. They also shipped with stains on them. After using them for about a week we noticed that the food stains were not coming off of them. Also they are so flimsy that whenever the baby leans up against the edge of the highchair they smash shut. We ended up getting the baby bjorn brand and have loved those...these we gave to the grandparents to have over at their house as a backup.
B001NIZVIE|3|These aren't my favorite burp cloths, but they'll do in a pinch.    Pros: thick, great fabric choices  Cons: not extremely soft, not large enough
B00NIU69SQ|5|This is a heavy duty mirror that is much easier to install and adjust than any other baby mirror I have used. You will not be disappointed.
B00UKBUE1O|1|This is totally unsafe to use. Anything that does not come with the car seat itself is considered unsafe. I can't believe they actually sell these.
B004DTT7LM|5|very nice
B007BI8GEQ|5|Bought the wrong....
B000ZEZ2BS|3|Does the job, though its difficult for my four month old to keep in his mouth unless he's actively sucking.
B004NSPFRI|1|I am currently pregnant with my first child and have a few moments of worry so I heard a home doppler would be a good idea.. I found this one because it was pretty cheap compared to the others I've seen. It says not to use until third trimester but I figured I would try. It says to use in a completely quiet room. I locked myself in my bedroom and tried this. Let me tell you to NOT waste your money.. It is completely crap! No matter how quiet it is the monitor still picks up the slightest sound.    I am going to throw this away and spend the money to rent or buy a better doppler.
B008J3UD4S|2|You have to have an existing sun shade for this product to be of value. If you don't, it won't work. The only way this works is by draping it over an existing shade. If you have a shade, it probably works well.
B002NGNF60|3|I've owned these cups by Playtex for several months now. Hard top is great for older (18-36 month old) children. However, on occasion I have experienced leaks. They have leaked around the lid a few times, and also through the spout. The majority of the time they do not leak. I have yet to find a sippy cup that is completely leak proof. I've also used the munchkin soft spout ones and a couple of different Nuby cups. The Nuby cup leaked a lot. Amazon's price is a couple dollars less than in the stores.
B006P05S0Q|5|This will come in handy since I am not using a diaper bag bag but instead just my normal handbags and it fits perfectly!
B000CBNSJC|5|Cheap but really cute
B002L3T9VA|2|baby likes it, however when my son was 3 months old, he didn't have good control over his arms, so he hit his head really hard and it left a mark there. i would recommend it for a baby with better motor skills.
B000BUQNXW|4|The fitted mattress pad fit great on my grandson's crib and made it so much more comfortable for him. I've washed it once and it came out fine.
B00020V5A2|4|Our first monitor was just for sound, but every time we'd hear somethhing, you had to go and check. With this monitor, if you hear something, all you have to do is look at the video to see if you need to go in the room. I was worried with the negative reviews I read for this product, but it works great for us. You can strap the monitor to your belt, and get some things done around the house. The video in the dark is great. The monitor is color, but you'll only see that if your room is brightly lit.
B0019ZTHJU|5|I have a Zosephine diaper bag (Kyoto) and I love the bag so much that when my children grew out of diapers I just kept using it as a purse. I've also given many as gifts and the receivers all rave about the bag. Zosephine products are sturdy and stylish at the same time which is how I'd like someone to describe me!
B005WHQKI2|5|Love it, baby loves it, comfortable, wide, fits well in car, would buy again if I had to
B003JFKMWE|5|It really hangs easily. Like the look and how easy it was to write on it and mark her growth.
B002G9USH8|5|my son loves this - he can find his paci in his crib at night and he loves to cuddle with it.<br /><br />it's perfect size and it should be light as it hangs from the paci.<br /><br />confused by the negative reviews - it's worth every dollar - we own 3 so we can rotate and back up in case of loss.
B009X4C3QS|5|Reality Good Car seat. It Ford for Babys and kids. Will Bye it an Time Again. Tralla cool colors for Ebert one
B00A6FABNA|5|It was used for my baby 9 months and also my todler 4 years. The cotton is luxurious. The cartoon is good quality. Perfect for us.
B00007EFHP|5|I was looking for nice quality crib bedding that did not have cartoon characters on it. I also wanted something that would work for a boy or a girl, since we don't know what we are having, and I wasn't willing to pay $300 for the other sets I liked. Well, this set is it. We went to 2 or 3 Target stores to try and check it out but none of them had it in stock. My husband convinced me to order it over the internet, which I was hesitant to do without seeing it in person first. I think he was just ready to stop shopping for crib bedding!:) We ordered the dust ruffle and bumper pad and love them both. I was planning to order the matching sheets too but read all the reviews that said they shrunk so decided to find those somewhere else. When it came we put it on the crib right away and my husband laughed and said, Wow, this is really cute! He's right! It's adorable, without being too babyish and cartoony. The green is somewhere between a lime green and a sage green and the blue is a bit darker or brighter than a baby blue. From the picture, I thought there was yellow in the dust ruffle but it's blue, green and white. The bumper pad is green and white. We ended up finding matching sheets at Sears (green cotton jersey) and JC Penney (blue and white checked cotton). The crib looks great! I only wish there was a matching window valance. For now, we haven't found anything but I will keep looking. I did not notice any smell as some reviewers have said. 5 stars for the bedding, 1 star for Target for not keeping it in stock.
B001CFFX72|5|I feel very safe using this grip.  It clings better than single ones. You can put a lot more weight on it.
B00FI3LSN2|5|Amazing product!
B004OR1DQK|5|very good
B000AV5LZ8|4|It doesn't look as strong as I thought it would be, but it is actually more sturdy than I thought when we actually use it. My two-year-old daughter managed to climb up all by herself the first time she used it. However, it doesn't really fit with our toilet (one side of the knobs landed on top of the toilet seat instead of going into the hole), although we can still use it.
B001PBFWMO|1|I always used a bulb syringe with my first child. It seemed to work okay (though I had to be careful what brand bulb syringe I used. Some work better than others). When my second child had a cold at 6 weeks old I was at my in-laws without my bulb syringe. So I ran to the store and they only had a useless bulb syringe (bad brand) and this Graco Nasal Aspirator. I bought the graco with high hopes. Let me tell you...this thing does not work. It will not suction snot that is any thicker than water! And it made my baby scream and cry. Really pretty useless. I used it several times and finally gave up. I bought the NoseFrida on the recommendations of my mom friends. THAT works wonders! My baby still fusses when I suction his nose but the NoseFrida is much quicker and gentler and EFFECTIVE. No gimmicks, no bells and whistles. Just a simple design that works. I wouldn't recommend this doohickey at all.
B0000AY9XY|3|I registered for the Avent line because I was going to breasfeed and bottle feed.  Avent bottles were great because you could pump, store, and feed all in one.  Overall I was not pleased with these bottles.  Conveinient yes, but that was the best thing about them.  I read the instructions, and half the time they would leak.  I would retry capping it but sometimes it leaked sometimes it didn't.  As for the flow, the newborn nipple was to fast for my son.  Most of the time he was gagging, choking, or the formula was pouring out of the side of his mouth. He did not latch on very well to these nipples.  He developed a blister on his top lip from the hard silicone.  Some babies may latch on better than others.  Some may suck faster than others.  My son took in a lot of air which lead to a very gassy, fussy, unhappy baby.  After about 3 1/2 weeks I decided to try a different bottle.  The playtex drop ins.  We are having a lot of success.  We still use the Avent bottles to make and store formula so it wasn't a total waste.  My advice would be to buy a few and try them out before you invest in the whole line.
B004FV69YG|5|It is very colorful and cute. I love the fact that I can fold and save it for my child. I just love it
B002BH3NEU|5|I bought 2 of these seats for my 5 year old twin boys.  I have been very happy with them so far.  I got the same fabric (Onyx) as they had on their Boulevards, because it held up very well.  My boys are comfortable in these seats.  They seem more sturdy than some other high back booster I have looked at.  The secure guard 'clip' gives me some peace of mind in transitioning from a 5 point harness to a vehicle seat belt.  The seat has been easy for me to use.  It is still difficult for my boys to buckle themselves, because of the position of the lower buckle in my truck.  This is fine by me, because this way I know they are buckled correctly.
B00IQBQF8Q|4|My wife calls her new Subaru Forester &#34;the blue bunny&#34;.  This nice little rabbit rides with her and she loves it.  She especially likes the bunny's feet and carefully defined toes.
B00BHW7QXO|4|Love this item although the suction is not tight enough to prevent my 18 mo from pulling it up and tossing his food.
B00129H04C|4|I've been a snoopy fan since i was little, when i saw this bag i couldn't resist, i had to have it for my daughter who i'm expecting in a couple of months.  It arrived in perfect condition and i absolutely recommend it to other snoopy fans out there.
B001QKDI48|5|Good quality, I like that I can wind the bag back in if I decide I don't need one.
B004DC9TAI|5|Beyond fantastic, the only thing that would make this thing a better ride is if it had handbrakes and cup holders. Have taken it down the street, up and down hills, and even on some trails and it is great. One time we tied our Husky to the front and he took our 5 year old daughter for the ride of her life. It's truly a great stroller, wish it came in adult sizes and my kids could push me around for a change. I think BOB needs to start making and designing off road vehicles, that would awesome. I am still kind of questioning the price I assumed it cost so much because it was made in America or at least Pakistan, but come to find out it was made in China (probably by children or Political Prisoners for 50 bucks). But hey who am I to talk down to a corporation making money, I wish I had thought of it, and then all the parents would be pushing their kids around in the Ken Revolution. That has a nice ring to it. Also this seller is fabulous, I ordered it and within less than a week; what I was promised was delivered, if only our elected officials were as efficient.<br /><br />Bottom line is if you don't get a BOB, you must not love your child. So you have a choice spend the money now on a BOB or spend the money on therapy for your little squirt. Only to find out that he or she resents you for pushing them around in a far inferior stroller. The choice is yours and the choice is clear:  Viva La BOB.
B00BJRBU0W|1|I'm disappointed by this item. It is a sturdy stroller and I like how compact it folds (in half), but I'm not pleased at all with the wheels. They get turned around too easily, so the ride isn't smooth at all for the baby. I don't like the tray either, not much leg room for the baby. My child always gets her shins caught when I'm trying to take her out. The tray does come off, but not very easily. Selling this and getting a different one!
B00CXVHBSS|5|So cute
B009F98SSS|5|I love, love, love these bags. When you are out with your baby it is really not courteous to just toss a diaper into the trash as it will smell up the whole place. These bags are perfect for containing the odor. I would buy a billion of them if I could.
B0013P7WXO|5|My nephew is 7 months old and from birth he used the Soothie pacifier and loved it so when he started teething, I wanted to get him something similiar to what he was using and this was perfect, he loves to put things in his mouth and the texture of this is great, although he dosen't like to use it as a pacifier, the nipple is different.
B00LPQAXC8|5|Beautiful decal.  EXCEEDED our expecations.  It was easy and fun to put on the walls as well.  Highly recommend!
B00KNB50E2|5|Great delivery soft blanket
B0031QPQKY|3|I bought this to throw in the car or stroller for times when I don't need a full diaper bag with my 13 month old. The size is great, and the print is cute. I can fit four size 3 diapers and a small package of 40 wipes. This would also work well for cloth diapers, or even an extra set of clothes. There are no zippered pockets like other diaper clutches. I like this because it is versatile. This comes with a small thin mat that has no padding. It is not long enough for all of my toddler, but it will cover from his head to his bum. The good thing is that it doesn't take up much room in the bag.<br /><br />The big problem with this clutch is that it does not stay closed. It has two small internal magnets that are not strong enough to keep it closed, even when it's just in a diaper bag. I solved this problem by sewing on two pieces of Velcro, and now I'm quite happy with it. However, if you aren't prepared to make this modification, do not buy this item.
B00CS1SEHK|5|I liked it. It´s cute, the colors are great and the size is correct. This collection is very cute for baby girls.
B000BNJU6G|5|this is so good. I love this. very convenient and useful. I especially like the price and the color of the it.
B00KHWBSIE|5|Does the job for our babies stroller and provides cool air, the clasp is very strong and thick. Makes a little noise, not bad!
B00MAS01JK|5|Cute shoes & perfectly suited for a 19&#34; Doll dressed in Vikings gear. The bib will be used elsewhere. Both items are well made.
B000138GNY|5|They are more than just wipes for us.  We use them as washcloths and handkerchiefs too.  They are super soft and have held up really well through almost 100 washes so far.
B00N18ULHK|1|Very rigid plastic.  I don't use it because it gets in the way of the baby's food on her tray.  Do not recommend.
B001WAJVZM|3|I like just about everything Skip Hop makes, but I could not for the life of me get this to stay on our bath tub spout. I'm sure each one is different so it will only fit on some of them. Make sure you can return this if it doesn't work for you.
B0099XV3HI|5|my daughter is very active and curious so it was a good idea to buy a one piece matt for her safety.
B000GC20J6|1|Very useless pants.  I bought them and tried them on my toddler twins and they did not work at all on a boy or girl and I did buy the correct size.  They even leaked when used over diapers at night.  They bascially do nothing.
B0093JQXU0|3|I WISH the chair were the color as pictured here- instead it's much more CREAM/BEIGE/LIGHT BROWN in color, than winter white as pictured. Looks a lot more modern & chic  in that color than in the suer beige-y taupe- like color it actually comes in.
B006PASIL2|4|I love the kneeling pad...but no matter what i do the mat won't stick in my tub...
B00E8NGRN4|5|My son was 5 wks early and spent some time in the NICU due to breathing issues. He had one episode of sleep apnea. The dr and nurses assured us that it will not happen again but that didnt make us feel any better. This device gives me piece of mind, especially at night or when my little guy has a cold.
B00IH1FMBQ|5|The crib set is so adorable. My daughter just loves her new room for her baby.
B00H8MSK78|5|My son loves this seat.
B00005OONH|5|This chair is great!  I got 2 for my twin girls and couldn't be happier.  There are several height settings so I can sit on a stool, a dining room chair or on the floor and still be comfortable.  The tray is easy to attach and remove.  The removable tray fits nicely into the dishwasher and makes clean up a breeze.  The adjustable reclining back makes it comfortable for my little ones to sit back a bit but will be nice for them to sit up straight as they get older.  The color is a bit bright but we can live with that in order to have the convenience, safety and reliability.  Also, the base is a bit bulky but it folds up so you can set in a corner or against a wall. <br />I originally had the Graco Harmony and went to put it together to find broken parts.  Then I read the online reviews to find many, many negatives about it. <br />I'd definitely recommend this to anyone (and have already to many family and friends)!
B00D731FCO|4|I love the necklace. Wish it was just a little bit shorter though so it would be in eyesight of my baby while he's breastfeeding.
B00AWLZDH2|1|cheapest made rack in the history of all racks.  It was difficult to even connect it because for some reason the customer has to assemble this tiny rack from 6 pieces it arrives in  (?!) and the parts didn't fit quite well.  A very disappointing product for this brand.
B00RDT3UYO|5|They work great! When it's on Voice Act, it's virtually silent until my daughter makes a noise, unless we've left the sound machine running, then we can hear that the whole time. Love them. Would recommend.
B005SZKICW|5|We bought this and it's big enough for the Smart Planet Round 3-Compartment Collapsible Silicone Eco Meal Kit on The Go with Spork. My daughter has a 9 ounce life factory glass water bottle which also fits, just not with the silicone meal kit.  At first I found that I wasnt able to fit much in the lunch bag, but then realistically, children don't need that amount of food I was filling it with. Hahaha my 3 yr old's first day of school and I was worried she would go hungry.  Silly me!  With careful consideration, this bag gives more than enough room for a child's lunch. And it's easy for my dashes to zip open and close.  There is a name tag on the inside which also has room for your phone number.  I've put this through the wash and hung it out to dry and it's good as new.  Drying time is very short.  I've packed her lunch in it straight from the wash and it was just damp.  But not wet.  A typical lunch that would fit in this lunch bag would be a meal in a 2-cup round glass container, her glass bottled water, fork, napkin, and a small bag with a salty snack and an ice box p. Or her 3 compartment meal kit and a juice box and and ice box to keep things cool.
B0045I6IAY|5|Our son was a 3 pound preemie and even with his little mouth, he was able to suck on this pacifier. He loved it!
B001W98104|5|Easy to wash and they hold up well. We have washed a zillion times and they show no signs of aging.
B001FOFGEA|2|There are other strollers around same price but use better materials. Cosco seems to have interesting designs a notch up from $20 generic umbrella strollers  but with terrible workmanship and material selection. Assembly was fairly easy although the illustrations and directions in the manual don't resemble the stroller parts, probably written for a previous model but were too lazy to alter. I don't have issues about the baby's snack tray banging on the ground when folding up the stroller. A highlight of the Altura is that it can be collapsed with one hand and that's true, I achieved it on first attempt, although I wish it would fold up more compactly.     However the following really irk me: the safety belt.. it just goes around the waist and does not go across the chest, so if you are blessed with an active inquisitive baby he might be able to escape the restraint, beware! Next the overall structure seems flimsy, I tightened every joint and it still rattles as if parts were loose. Weight balance is an issue too, back of stroller seems heavier so make sure your hanging diaper bag isn't heavy, unless you have a very heavy baby, it only takes a little pressure for the whole stroller to tilt backwards. The seat does not recline all the way, it's just a slight tilt maybe +20' degrees. Nylon canopy isn't completely water-resistant. If used in a light drizzle fine, anything heavier your baby IS going to get soaked. There are 2 not 1 pedals for the brake. Make sure you still got a firm hold on the stroller before parking it completely. Lastly front wheels are too big, when baby is tall enough he might kick them or rest his feet there posing a danger to you and himself when going downslope. Remember the seat belt only holds him at the waist. If he's tilting forward he might fall right off.     Verdict? Good for simple walks indoors like the mall, or outdoors on flat level terrain, not recommended as an everyday stroller. Otherwise please spend a little more for a safer stroller.
B0011MQLNQ|2|We were very happy with Fisher-Price Snugabunny Cradle 'N Swing and decided to buy one more swing to another floor. I liked the stile of ZEN one and we decided to try.  That was a disappointment! It is more expensive, but swing speed is much lower than of one of Snugabunny. Even if we put it on max!  Mobile does not move. Our little one does not like it as much as Snugabunny.
B00915TRUY|5|perfect fit
B003IT4YC0|1|Doesn't hold right, seems like its missing something, moves at every turn, I hate it! And just so difficult to put my son in everytime we get in the car..
B00E9F3LZS|5|I have a friend who buys these as a gift for every baby shower she attends, saying that this is the ultimate &#34;gift you never knew you needed&#34; for new moms. My sister got pregnant and I decided to steal my friend's idea. I got her these blankets and sure enough, 5 months later, I never see her daughter without one: wrapped in it, laying on it, covered in it. It's such a multi-use blanket, now my sister gives them as gifts to her friends!<br /><br />She says these are the nicest A+A blankets out there. She tried to buy some more at Babies R Us, but said they aren't the same softness or quality. She also said she likes the larger size - you can double them for colder days, or have them single layer for the summer.<br /><br />I will be buying these for all future baby showers I attend. Great gift!!
B00IJRYXYK|1|GARBAGE!  It is like cellophane to put on walls that doesn't stick and will most likely take the paint off when take down.  This is in Centimeters (NOT A USA Product).  Terrible delivery, took over 1 month to get. Cheap is Cheap - DO NOT BUY!
B0000789SZ|5|She is still playing with this toy at 7 months. <br />A bigger plus is that the sounds aren't horrendously obnoxious. <br />In fact, it is one of her toys with the best sound quality. <br /> <br />I especially like that this toy will grow with her.
B007DWC4UC|5|These work great. I no longer have to take the clip off the back of the baby's seat and can leave this one in my car all the time. Great for grandparents!
B000UD3ZGI|5|This thing is a Godsend! I loved that it was all one giant pillow and not a bunch of them Velcro'd together like one I previously bought and returned. I really would never have been able to sleep ever while I was pregnant if I didn't have this. It also was very awesome after my daughter was born since I had to have an emergency c-section and it was painful to lay down in bed. Highly recommend this!
B00624DJRY|4|Love it! most importantly my baby loves it too!!! and she is a very hard to please almost 4 month old. Let me say that I did a tremendous research before buying a sling. For some reason K'tan wasn't my first choice. I ordered ring sling instead... And sent it right back! Material was awful, very tarp like. Baby K'tan is SOOO soft and pleasant to the touch. Then ring sling didn't offer that many positions, not like K'tan. I'm using it only in a hug position for now, but I\\"m sure my daughter will love all the others as well. This thing has become a life saver for us. She would be fussy, screaming and crying - I stick her in k'tan walk a little bit or stand in a yard and she just looks around and quietly falls asleep. And that's the baby that won't fall asleep unless she has my breast in her mouth.:)<br />It's very easy to put on, no wrapping all those crazy layers of material - I just couldn't imagine doing that. Oh, and did I mention we live in S.Florida? So no layers for us )))<br />another thing - my back. I couldn't hold my baby for more than couple of minutes. Pain and burning in my back would get unbearable. But with baby K'tan I can wear my daughter for 1-2 hours. )))<br />There are only couple of things that i take 1 star off the ratings for.<br />1. I couldn't manage to breastfeed in it. But they say on the web site that it's not for everybody and it might not work for you. So i'm ok with that.I'd rather sit down and nurse her discreetly anyway.<br />2. It does stretch.<br />-overtime. so you just need to wash and dry it. which is not a big deal at all. You should do it anyway. My daughter that spits out pacifiers likes to suck or lick on this. ))) wrap didn't change the color or got any kind of wear from washing.<br />-as you wear it for an hour or so baby tends to slide down a little bit a i have to re-position it. I can see how that can become annoying for somebody who plans to wear it for several hours straight.<br />but I'm not doing any long hikes or vacation type walks wearing baby, so i don't care much.<br />3. We would need 2 sizes if my husband wanted to baby-wear. Which would get expensive.<br /><br />So that's it. I never leave reviews but I felt like doing it for K'tan, because i'm so happy with the purchase. The other day guy at the grocery store was asking me all kinds of questions about it and he said that I should work for K'tan because i was so enthusiastic about it. if I'll remember something else i will update.
B007TJVYSM|5|These were perfect for when baby was young. Need bigger ones now!
B00168DAWU|3|Nice
B00Q3D310Y|4|They are nice books
B003I867US|5|I got mine cheaper at Target, but this is an amazing carrier! I've tried numerous slings and wraps before this one and found them to be too warm, too difficult to use, uncomfortable for myself or the baby, or incredibly expensive. This one is perfect. Very comfortable, reasonably priced, attractive, and my baby loves it. We walked around the museum today for 2 hours...
B000FT7NSI|5|My husband and I were looking for a crib for our first child, but most of the ones we found were either ridiculously expensive or seemed cheap and not sturdy.  We bought the DaVinci crib online because the price was reasonable and it got good reviews.  We are very pleased with this product.  It was fairly easy to put together and is very sturdy.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B006QI1PCW|2|I bought this for our son when he was about 4 mos old. Started using it right away. So, it's a nice design. It has 3 big attachment toys, a piano, a &#34;drum&#34; with a spinner rattler, and a flip note (musical note) booklet that plays different tunes. So, he loved jumping on this thing, it's great. I had already read the troubles kids had turning on the seat part prior to purchasing this, but it wasn't an issue for us. The seat is hard, but my little guy Is crazy and God knows how he did turns on it, but he did. It also has 2 soft toys for chewing, a marraca set and and a musical note, he liked those, but they are not too soft on the edges, so I took those away. It also has a microphone that's practically a giant rattle toy. He hit himself once and cried a little, I guess he did learn that if he slapped it to hard and it came around in a circle it would slap him and he never hit it that hard again, so there's a plus. And it has 3 plush toys on a bar that if you pull them they make a short tune of each instrumental sound. The bar of plushy pull-e toys is okay. The 3 toy attachments, the piano is great, hard, but great, the flip note book things was awesome, but didn't last, my son would flip back and forward between tunes, and after a week or two it went haywire. The drum that you push, plays a really short drum &#34;solo&#34; and nothing else, and it's super low, so it was a bummer. ALL IN ALL, IT'S NICE TO LOOK AT AND MY SON LOVED JUMPING ON IT, and 3 out of the toys attached. I don't recommend this, just because it's too much money for  the toys not to hold up, and for it's limited features. y son also outgrew it quickly, but my son was a pretty tall baby, so not the jumpers fault. My son is 1 1/2 now. I got rid of the jumper, kept the toys, even the bar one, and slowly I'm getting them to work by taking them apart and just seeing what the prom could be. Only 3 work the book looking one, still goes haywire. But even now as a toddler he's loving the toys. They should sell the toys separate I'd buy them in an instant. Pleasant tunes, and the base was easy to clean and sturdy. Sorry if the review is all over the place, just trying to remember to not leave anything out. Once again, for the price it's too plain, I wish I would've bought him a Fisher Price one with more toys and junk on it. But what' s done is done. He likes the attachments NOW so that's a plus and it did serve him as a jumper, but again for the price it was too expensive for having limited toys and functions in it.
B001QXCF1C|4|Great starter sippy for getting a toddler off the bottle because the top is soft rubber, not hard plastic like some other sippy cups.  It's not perfectly drip free, but pretty good.  He still pushes it to the side and asks me for a bottle, but a lot less with these than with conventional sippy cups....!
B0042D69WY|5|I really like being able to change direction of the swing and chair.  The mirrored dome is great for holding baby's attention.  I wish the swing setting could be set even slower or with a shorter range of motion though.  For some strange reason, our baby likes to poop (in her diaper) when she's sitting in this, which oddly, is actually kinda useful.
B0002U1RFA|1|When the lining ripped the first time I thought it was a fluke, so I returned it and got another one. Within a week, the second bag ripped as well. This time I went to the manufacturer and they sent me a different style of the bag which I have been using for 5 months and I love it. This bag stinks, they need to stop selling it. I would think after all of these reviews someone would do something. My advice is to call Baby Boom.
B0007CQ6SG|5|Very durable product and loved that it comes with sticker labels and clear plastic corks [not sure their actual term ;)] that you put inside the bottle before screwing on lid to ensure it's not be hit by the air while inside the fridge. This can also be used with Medela products, as I also pump with these bottles. Total lifesaver in the 1st few months.
B00JRYS3FE|3|Pros  - Great colors  - Construction was much better than anticipated  - Very comfortable push  - Infant seat is compatible with hundreds of other strollers, such as something lighter    Cons  - Very heavy for my wife  - Folds flat but still very bulky  - Self locking front wheel    Unfortunately, we had to return this item due to the constant locking of the front wheel. Otherwise, this stroller would have been really good as an offroad jogging stroller.
B003IHN50E|4|Keeps moisture and odors from my cloth diapers to a minimum.  Cool colors and good quality.  Slightly moist thru other side when time to wash, that's after sitting up to 5 days.
B00IU0RAI2|5|👍
B0052QYLUM|5|The Infant Optics DXR-5 Digital Video Baby Monitor was exactly as advertised, and works flawlessly. Having a monitor with a camera, a night vision one at that, has proven to be a great reliable system for our family. The camera captures live, clear, non-choppy footage of the baby. There's 5 brightness settings on the camera. The audio that it captures is clear as well. There's a volume toggle on the receiver and the speaker is plenty loud, there also seems to be a system in place that turns the speaker off when it detects that a sound is constant (such as a fan) although it is extremely sensitive to even the slightest sound from the baby.<br /><br />The receiving unit has about 4-5 hours of battery life. No complaints.<br /><br />The range is solid, It works wall to wall in our 1400 sq ft apartment, and through the walls and doors.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend it.
B00F2MQDU2|5|It is a hit! Grand baby loves this toy.
B0009PAN7Q|4|Early on this is probably the harder way to train (compared to a separate potty) and when little boys pee sitting down you do get a little ring of pee on the toilet seat.  However now that we are potty trained (at 2 years and 3 months) it is perfect. We don't have to teach about going on a different seat or anything. And it stays on the seat easily with little adjustment and pull right off without any trouble if someone else needs to use the potty. I will be using this for my second child as well.
B00063EDEK|1|I was in my 3rd trimester when I ordered this. I started to get leg pains from having to lay on my side all of the time. My chiropractor recommended using something like this to support my stomach and my legs. This pillow was worthless. It did not help with the pain at all. It was too flat between my legs. It did no more for me than a $5 pillow did. I returned it and would not recommend spending $30 on this pillow.
B006NHAUPE|5|We recently had a chance to try out a couple of their swaddling blankets from their Carnival Pack and we love them. We are very familiar with swaddling because when my son was an infant we used it to help soothe him at night and during nap times. He used to sleep longer and better every time we used a swaddle for him.<br /><br />Because Aura Weavers blankets are made from breathable muslin there is very low risk of overheating baby, a safety concern  some parents worry about when swaddling their baby. Babies actually enjoy the cozy and calming womb-like sensation inside of the swaddle, specially during the first months of their life.<br /><br />What's great about muslin blankets is that they can be used with your infant, toddler and beyond. I find that you can never have too many blankets, specially when they are super soft and breathable like Aura Weavers blankets. Their blankets can be used as a nursing cover, sun shade or sleep shade for the stroller, play mat and more,  they are even great for toddlers who love making tents and forts or playing peek-a-boo.<br /><br />I really like that the Aura Weavers muslin blankets come with easy to follow swaddling instructions. With the Aura Weavers all the instructions you need are right on the box.
B002R2BFVM|5|This gate is perfect for the bottom of our stairs in the foyer. We didn't want something intrusive in the limited space, and this is perfect because it retracts and we can leave it open when our little one is asleep. We did NOT purchase the $30/side kits to mount to our banisters - my Dad and husband rigged it for a few bucks instead. They cut 2x4's to fit the area from the floor to just above where the gate mounts would be, used felt and corner protectors (plastic) and heavy duty zip ties to secure the (painted) 2x4's to the banisters. They do NOT move, we will be able to clip the zip ties when ready, with no damage to banisters, and they're not cheap plastic, as reviews for the expensive kits said.  PERFECT!<br /><br />The gate is a somewhat flexible material, so I would never feel safe with it at the top of the stairs, but we are just trying to keep our brave climber from climbing unattended, and at the bottom, it is mounted so it touches the floor, so there is a full-stair overlap - she could never squeeze through with her wriggly ways. You do generally need 2 hands to open/close, but it is worth it. We have used so many different gates over the years and this is the best for this situation. Worth the price!
B00KHZPH74|5|I was a skeptic when I ordered this for my 11 week old daughter. The first night she wore it she actually slept a full 8 hours! Prior to this glorious night she only slept 1.5 - 2 hours at a time and always broke out of her swaddle. Wish I had bought this sooner.
B002TNBIEI|2|I would love it to work, but it did not last even 2 months. Can't say anything about the smell, because just in 1 day the bad smell  was gone.
B003ZFPRHS|5|Previously i had one thermometer but dod not allow to change the batteries.  This one besides being cute and good quality i can change the batteries.
B00368CLXW|5|Nice quality and fits well. We won't be using the pockets because everything you put in there is in the way for the child's legs and feet.
B000CSEE3O|5|Nice Product
B001I481LM|5|Super time saver, I premix lots of formula for my twins. Easy to clean and assemble, I bought 2!!!!
B00OFGWQLQ|5|Great german snack, wish it was cheaper as it's just a tiny waffle.
B00AO084CW|2|The motor gave out a few weeks after I started using it. I don't find it worth the effort or money to buy another motor since it may break as soon as the last one did.
B00DNBA82S|1|The monitor is good, especially for the price. The battery life is pretty short and it only takes a month or so before you start to see it really dwindle to where you have to keep it hooked up to the cord after about 5 hours. It must be plugged in if you wish to have it on overnight. My biggest issue with it, and probably why I wouldn't buy it again, is the lack of ability to turn the screen off and still retain sound. It has a VOX mode but it is very very sensitive which means that it is not possible to have the screen off and just keep sound on. I like to have the monitor sound on at night but not the screen and have had to resort to putting the monitor face down to be able to accomplish this. Really wish that there was a way to do this, if they changed that one feature it would be a repeat purchase, if needed, for me.  ______  A couple months later and I have to edit my review. I had to have the monitor replaced after 2 months due to inability to charge the unit. The next monitor they gave me lost the charge even faster and I have had to resort to purchasing another monitor because this one is pretty terrible. PLEASE DONT EVEN CONSIDER BUYING THIS MONITOR. I ended up getting the Foscam Wifi camera that runs off your smart phone. I considered this model when I made this purchase and really wish I had just bought that one in the first place.
B000FFL58Q|5|I was tossing up between this one and the Lamaze Symphony.  I'm glad that I chose this one - my baby loves the music and seems very captivated by the various toys and color scheme.  Overall I would highly recommend it to new parents.  My baby can often amuse herself but I prefer to get down on the floor and play with her.  She squeals with delight everytime we use it together.
B00E9RMHD8|2|Update (3/2015) - I still really like this monitor 3 months after owning it but not holding a charge, not ok. If I unplug the parent unit, it dies instantly. Really?? Thank goodness amazon is replacing it (because it's within the return period) but come on Philips! Seems like this charging issue is a known problem...we'll see how long the next one lasts. Fingers crossed! Awesome monitor. After having a video monitor that interfered with our wi-fi, and drove us nuts due to the poor sound quality (the video was just so so), this monitor totally does the trick. The sound is excellent, I can set the sensitivity low or high so I can hear only when she cries or make it so it picks up all noise. And because our home's temperature fluctuates, the temp gauge alarm is super helpful!
B005WHQKI2|3|I was a little disappointed in the padding and construction.  I am having a difficult time with pulling the strap to tighten for the rear facing position.
B00433OQO6|5|Ordered for my daughter who just had baby. The bottles are of great quality and was the best price I have seen for the Avent bottles!
B007PDIA7A|5|This is my 4th zzzZipme sack. I have purchase 2 for 65-70F room and 2 of this kind (72-78F). The first couple I bought was for my baby when she was in the 3-6 months size. I got one for her daycare and one for home. Now that she grew up I got her the next size, also two of them, and I am planning on getting the next size up. This bags are very nice quality, very soft and durable and I am relax knowing that she is warm and safe on her crib at daycare and at home. She has enough room to move her legs around and the designs are also really cute. I tried a different brand first than this, but most other brands including that one, don’t have the double zipper, which is a key feature of these bags. For late night diaper changes it is so easy to undo only her bottom part of the bag instead of the whole thing. Another great feature is the tabs to cover the metallic parts of the zipper, so if she put them on her mouth she wont get in touch with them. It is just a very well thought design.
B00005YWN0|2|Safety 1st is more expensive then this monitor but it's well worth the money because this monitor is terrible I have to put the camera on top of my son to be able to see anything, the image is terrible and the light from the camera is way too bright, the only thing good about it is the sound.
B00HAZSOEM|5|we take pictures every month with this. at 4 months now, and he's starting to pull at them. but we still got some good shots, and we get tons of compliments. we dress him in his diaper and a t-shirt every month, and then stick the tie on.
B009FUL47O|5|I brought this bag for my wife and she loves it. Good quality and an affordable price. I recommend this bag to any and everyone.
B000067K0L|5|We purchased this gym ([[ASIN:B000067K0L Tiny Love Super Deluxe Lights and Music Gymini Activity Gym]]) for our fourth baby. I debated over buying it because we are pretty sure she is our last baby and it is not cheap. All of my babies have loved activity gyms, however, so I wanted one and thought this looked like a good option.<br /><br />My baby is now eight months old and she still completely loves this gym. It has value and interest for a variety of ages and stages. It has been completely worth the purchase and I would do it again without hesitation. She has enjoyed it essentially for her entire life. I have owned other gyms, and none have held interest this long into a baby's life.<br /><br />A great thing about this gym is that it easily folds flat. I can fold it and unfold it while holding the baby. Because of storage ability, I can fold it up when she is done playing and store it out of the way and it is not taking up floor space. You can also easily change out the toys hanging from it if your baby needs a change in toys.<br /><br />I definitely think this is one of the best gyms out there.
B006NWKDKG|4|I have bought 4 baby bags, and my son is only 5 months old!  I was looking for a bag that wasn't \\"babyish\\" but held everything I needed. I took a chance on this bag even though there was only one review, and I'm glad I did. The only complaint I have is that it's really an orange color, not RED like I thought from the site. It's still pretty though, and has purple lining. The pockets on the inside do not go up high enough to hold a tall bottle, but I still put my bottles in them and haven't had any issues with spills yet. The stroller straps are nice. So far, I'm pleased!
B007FI2KHG|2|It takes a lot of time to put together . Although it was really cute and great to hand out to guest .
B00A2F5LK2|5|My 20 month old who is 32 pounds and equally as tall fits on this perfectly. Great investment to throw in the wagon or stroller for on the go. Love it! Nothing to throw away, just wipe it clean and your good to go.
B0029DPGDW|3|These work great for damp and dirty items, but we had to use it as a barf bag in a pinch during a car ride and well...they aren't leakproof.  In fact, some of the liquid would transfer if you even touched the side of the bag.  Maybe it's because these have been through the water a few times and are about 6 months old...<br /><br />In any case, they've been great to stuff in the purse with a change of clothes and to put soiled clothes in, but I wouldn't trust them with anything really nasty or wet.
B002SWK6A2|5|I had them sent to my daughter and she loves them an uses them all the time.  Came very quickly!
B008VWOY6U|5|We purchased this item for our daughter who is just starting to walk. It's just adorable and she loves watching the wings flap while it moves. She has dropped it, dragged it on it's side and rolled it and it still holds up well. Would make a great gift for a 1-year old.
B002CGRSXC|4|Works great but need better way to stop gate from drooping.<br />Kids inadvertently push down on latch assembly while opening gate so i need to constantly re-square gate sections to allow the gate to latch.  Provided attached brackets with allen screws just bend when tightened.
B00KISGJJ0|5|So convenient. Love it. Holds my phone and water bottles.
B003IT4YC0|3|Well, I took a chance on this product and, even though I have bucket seats, was disappointed to find that the seat did tip over (not a little, but a LOT) with most turns. I read this in several reviews, but since I have bucket seats I thought this item might be ok. I was forced to return this item to Amazon within about a week of use. I believe this is due to the base being substantially narrower than the body of the seat.<br />Saying that, I was impressed with the fabric, cushioning, and head support. Arrived on time. Excellent customer service from Amazon, as always.
B000ALBM42|5|Love it.
B004U7OQWW|5|Before potty-training my daughter, I went looking for something to protect her car seat and found this. It's great. Ironically, we haven't had to find out its effectiveness with a potty accident, but it's even more useful to me as a crumb catcher and containment for a spilled drink.
B004XRT002|1|tooooooo tight and smelled
B006ZOIT7Q|3|Does it work?  Not for me.  I wasn't even sure if teething was the problem.  I just needed my baby to sleep.  I use it on his ankle at night.
B004P1IVXI|1|I bought this to match the theme for my baby's room (we have the matching hamper, bedspread, bumper).  I always wash everything before using it.  But as soon as it came out of the washing machine (and I was all of my baby's things with gentle cycle & cold water), the blanket was pilling and fuzzed up.  In fact, the rest of the load (my baby's clothes) were all covered in the fluff!  I had to re-wash the load without the blanket.<br />A BIG disappointment!  Love the colors and design but need to be made with better quality!
B00208S304|5|Keeps my baby from chomping on her wooden crib. Plus it's soft. Love this.
B000CSEE3O|5|I wish I knew a word that was stronger than Love. This is an adorable little booster. It folds compactly like the adult camp chairs. It has a little bag. It stores in my truck and remains there so we always have it when we need it. I would have liked the storage bag to have had a carry strap, but that was easily fixed with a strip of nylon webbing from the local craft store. I sewed it on to the bag and we are in business! We always get compliments on this little chair. The cup holder mesh pocket on the side is one of the best features! No more sippy cups knocked off of the table! There are so many great qualities to this chair, I can't think of one bad one! This is definitely a great product for the price and it is so versatile we can use it at home or on the go. It has a seat belt, and adjustable belts that attach it to the back and bottom of whatever chair you are using it on. Love this chair!
B003TFZ184|5|Love the large size, covers most of the tub.  It's aesthetically pleasing.  It's cushioned well, very comfortable on the feet.  There are a few loose spots on it but it suctions to the bottom of the tub just as good as any other bath mat I've owned.
B0029DPGDW|5|A lot of people seem to be complaining about the size of this product.  I easily fit my swim suit as well as my two children's suits into one bag with no problem.  I hang dry them inside out after use and when I do wash them I hang dry them as well.  I think this product is great!
B001I7PY1E|1|The mat does not suction on to the bathtub at all and slip slides around. More dangerous than no bath mat. Complete waste of money.
B0097C3V0I|5|When our son was asked what Kidzikoo to choose he picked the car design right away! And we have used it pretty much every day for months now. It still looks like new (you can put it in the washing machine!) and warm tea and cold water are no much more comfortable to hold.
B00QXGGYN2|5|Great product! Fits well and serves its purpose.
B000PE8E0E|1|I ordered 2 sets and they weren't the right tubing. I did purchase my pump prior to the date listed, but this did not fit correctly and when I tried it, a piece of my pump broke. Now I have to buy a brand new pump b/c mine is ruined.
B00GY04984|4|My grand son likes it. but it did get some water inside of it, i hope it last for a long time.
B00HHGTMNG|3|In case anyone can't do math, this &#34;value&#34; set now costs more than the individual components purchased separately.<br /><br />Good products, stupid packaging.
B002SW3BBI|5|Great pattern and quality - I just wish Aden and Anais made more sleeping bags available in XL - we love them for our 2 year old and helps keep her safely in the crib and warm at night..!
B00006S3RX|5|My son got this from his grand-parents for Christmas a few months ago.  Contrary to the \\"professional\\" people who leave comments to scare people away and make others feel like they are bad parents, this saucer is wonderful.  Lots of little things to catch a childs eye, and many things for them to play with.  My son is 6 months old and I will place him in the saucer for a quick shower or so I can start dinner.  I don't recommend getting one of these and keeping your child in it all day long, but for when you need a minute this is great.  Very sturdy and it also scrunches down for easy storage.  My father-in law researched quite a few, and I will admit I was against the exer-saucers at first.  However, when I actually became a parent to a very high-maintenance child...this tends to give me a minute if needed and gives my son a little recess time of his own.
B002IVTPIW|5|We just love this inflatable bed we purchased for our 4 year old grand-daughter. You can tuck the sheets and blankets in which is a plus with a wiggley little one and she doesn't end up on the floor, like she used to because of the raised sides. I notice that she actually sleeps better in this bed also. And it's big enough to last her for many, many years.
B0011H1Y06|5|This was the perfect size I was looking for and very soft.  Nice for little hands to hold and love.

B001G4RWG4|5|Perfect!  Just as described and exactly what I expected! It will get a ton of use.
B000056OV0|5|Once our baby was old enough to move into a larger tub (about 6 months), we had the hardest time finding one that she liked.  Everything else didn't seem to support her well, and made me very nervous trying to bathe her.  We tried 3 other tubs until we found the EuroBath.  She loves bath time now and so do I.  She can splash around safely and I don't feel like I need to keep both hands on her at every second.  This tub really keeps her secure.  Our baby is 8 months old now and I think we will be using this tub for many months to come!
B0010CD2IO|3|I bought these because I had the ones that had the hole in the middle and my 12 month old learned how to stick her finger in there and pop them off.  I liked that these had the cover over the hole so she couldn't easily stick her finger in there.  However, the part that comes down on these guards, make it easy for the little ones to open the doors.  At 18 months, my daughter learned how to squeeze them and open the doors.  These do look nice though.
B0012IXXGM|1|VERY VERY  cheap fabric.  The material quality is the WORST.<br />PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. ITS LIKE FLUSING THE MONEY DOWN THE TOILET. I do not want to give even 1 star.<br />I WOULD NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM SOHO DESIGNS EVER AGAIN.
B006I0R5AO|4|I liked the shape and the colors of these bottles. But when my smart daughter learned to push the nipple inside to loosen the cap and then unscrew it - she would spill the milk all over her... No matter how tight I would close them, she would mess with them, so I took them away.
