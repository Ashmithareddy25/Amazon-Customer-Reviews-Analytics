6305426651|4.0|Roberto Benigni's celebrated affirmation of the human spirit owes a little to \\"Rhinoceros,\\" Ionesco's absurdist play from the Sixties.  There's the same attempt to reduce the worse horror in human history to the absurd.  Perhaps this is a way of comprehending something monstrous beyond comprehension.  Benigni was criticized in some circles for trivializing the Holocaust, but that is not what he did.  He sought to rise above it.  I don't know whether he or Ionesco were really successful.  On the other hand has anybody-any religion, philosophy or great artist-ever solved the problem of evil in this world?<br />There's something of Charlie Chaplin in Benigni's irrepressible hero, and in the camera work look for the influence of Orson Wells in light and shadow.  The strange splashes of color on such places as the concentration camps walls reminded me curiously of Jacque Demy's \\"Umbrellas of Cherbourg,\\" a wondrous French operetta from the Sixties (starring Catherine Deneuve, music by Michel Legrand).<br />The movie is a little slow at times and we miss a lot of Benigni's mugging as our eyes chase after the subtitles (get the dubbed version), but the central idea, that with our attitudes we create the world, and that life can be beautiful even in the midst of tragedy, is uplifting, if hard to believe.
B000002LMK|4.0|I am not a Neil Young fan per se, so I can't really compare this to any of his other albums, so take this review for what its worth.  The song structures on this album are somewhat pedestrian, kind of folky, you know, three of four chords, chorus verse chorus and such.  The lyrics, too, are fairly banal.  Lots of lines about love, how great love is, etc.  Nice sentiments, just not particularly interesting.  Why four stars then?  Guitar solos.  Neil takes extended solos on many of the songs which are absolutely jaw-dropping.  Maybe they are not technical masterpieces, but the raw emotion, originality, and psychedelic insight they contain is absolutely astounding.  As beautiful, I think, as an average Jimi Hendrix solo, but beleive me folks, that's saying a lot.  If you're not a Neil Young fan and don't like mind-blowing guitar solos, avoid this though.  It's a pity that the songs themselves are such sing-songy summer campesque conceits.
6305609705|5.0|I've seen Apocalypse Now a number of times and own the original. Redux was my first opportunity to see the film in a theater, and for providing that experience alone, Redux easily deserves five stars. It's unfortunate that great films aren't re-released more often to theaters in restored prints, much like music is routinely digitally remastered and re-released on CD. If it takes the re-editing gimmick of Redux to bring the film back to theaters, then so be it.<br />Like certain great films (Lawrence of Arabia comes to mind), Apocalypse Now was truly made for a widescreen, surround-sound experience that only a good film print and theater can provide. See it this way and you'll be grateful for the experience.<br />That said, in my opinion Redux falls short of the original. The long French plantation scene is too talky (much of it in French) and distracts from the vortex that is the trip up the river to Kurtz. The river trip structurally mirrors the similar trip in Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and desperately needs to survive as the clear spine of the film. The French plantation scene could have survived in 1/2 its running time more effectively, or have been cut altogether without harming the film. (There are certainly a few decent lines in the dinner scene, but the digression overall takes the viewer out of the central movie plot and out of the visceral experience of moving up river.) The music accompanying the superfluous bedroom scene is also ludicrous and out of place.<br />The extension of the Kilgore scene involving Willard stealing the surfboard similarly disrupts the film. The original ended on Kilgore's famous &quot;love the smell of napalm in the morning&quot; lines, which are so devastating that almost anything else to follow in that scene would be a distraction. To cut to goofball action involving stealing the surfboard and shots of Willard giggling and falling down is a true failure in editing.<br />Unlike some reviewers, I thought the second Playboy bunny scene did improve the film, providing some good character development for two of the men and a further demonstration of the complete degradation of U.S. ambitions and morality in Viet Nam, mirrored in the movie plot. The &quot;bad acting&quot; of the women here is appropriate, if cruel; we're seeing limited minds at work here, among all four characters in the helicopter.<br />The remaining alterations were minor. If anything, I was surprised by how *little* changed in the movie, considering Redux was supposedly a complete re-edit from the original source footage. If this is the best Coppola &amp; Co. can come up with from 20 years reflection and 150 hours of source footage, this is more evidence than anyone needs that the original is a masterpiece that should be left alone. Buy the original.

6305128952|4.0|I like all those sprawling shots of the Montana landscape.  The score and cinematography are the best things about this movie.  But there are several scenes that could have been left out and kept this movie under two hours long: when Annie invites the Bookers over for dinner, Annie's heart to heart with Mrs. Booker by the creek, and the barnhouse dance.  Of course which scenes to be cut is a matter of personal taste and opinion.  I think it should have been trimmed down.
6304297912|4.0|Of course \\"Trainspotting\\" is a disturbing film. (The toilet scene is hardly to be endured or stomached.) It is also gross and disgusting, as though Larry Flynt had gotten his hands on something like \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" But this Brit production with the heavy Scottish brogue (subtitles in places wouldn't hurt) is fortunately more than that; it is original and clever and moves right along. This is partly a cult film with all sorts of indie shibboleths and counter-cultural references; and partly an art film, with splashy sets and studied camera work; but mostly this is a full-blown commercial seduction of contemporary youth, worthy of the talent of somebody at, say, Sony or Pepsi or even the WB. (Yes, that is a left-handed compliment, unless, of course, you want to work for Sony or the WB. We'll have to check with director Danny Boyle on that.)<br />The opening theme (actually voiced over) is the idea that heroin or any really demanding addiction is preferable to ordinary life, an intriguing but stale notion designed to shock the bourgeoisie. The central theme proclaims that a heroin addict is just another kind of junkie, along with your cigarette, cola, beer, sex, grease, etc. junkies. (Bingo!) Yet at the end we see, as one might discover by watching all the commercials on PBS, that money will out. Kinda reminds me of what Omar Khayyam asked about wine nine hundred years ago: \\"I wonder...what the Vintners buy/One half so precious as the stuff they sell.\\" Here the answer is clear: money itself. Closing theme: money triumphs over heroin; money is the power god of heroin.<br />Ewan McGregor is excellent in the leading role as a junkie who is as cute as your brother, with fine support by Robert Carlyle, who plays a bantam who likes to cut people. The script by John Hodge is partly unintelligible, which is good; and the direction by Danny Boyle combines cartoon fantasy with stark realism, slick horror with black comedy, in a manner both derivative and sure to be imitated. The sound track, \\"available on Capitol Records,\\" (I rest my case) sold well. Some might say that this is a penetrating critique of modern urban society, but the only thing being penetrated is your pocket book. Yet, it is not a film to be ignored or forgotten..

B00005A46T|5.0|I know it had to have been hard to top their self titled debut cd, but I think that this just might have done it. It is filled with a much much angrier sound (if you can imagine that) and there are aren't any bad songs on here. I prefer the older intro to this one, but then the intro just gives a hint of what's waiting on into the cd. The pain filled screams are rampant, along with raging guitars and double bass drums at blistering speeds. Slipknot's is the best thing metal has going for it right now. I have strongly recommended this cd to everyone I know. Fave song is probably &quot;My Plague&quot; or &quot;the Shape&quot; F'n AWESOME!
6304675348|5.0|It was about time that a film like Scream came along. There was never anything fun or suspenseful going on in the genre anymore. Scream along and made these movies fun again. Not just fun, but exciting, suspenseful, and clever. Anybody who disagrees doesn't know the first thing about terror or suspense. What's great about Scream is that it's real. These are real characters with real lives and real everyday things going on in their lives, who happen to get mixed up in this horrible situation. This is what's on the news. This is real. The movie goes for characters and scares, not excessive gore or nudity. The film is obviously a tribute to &quot;real&quot; horror/suspense films like &quot;Halloween&quot;, and &quot;Psycho&quot;. That's what we've needed. The premise of a killer in a mask stalking teenagers is nothing new, but that doesn't mean it can't be new or fresh or scary. You just have to have a good script, direction, music, and acting. This film has all four. It brings back true terror to the genre that hasn't had much in the last few years. Scream has taken some flack from real gorehound horror buffs who slam it for being too safe and funny. I find that rather sad. It's too bad Scream had to have a backlash because it's smart(obviously),and had great direction from Wes Craven at the top of his game. If you want scary movies to be scary and fun, and not just about being too dark or violent, then this is the movie for you. You can't go wrong with Scream.

0790729628|5.0|When the history of the motion picture buisness is written, this is one of the films that will be spoken of in hushed tones. It's nightmare vision of a sprewling metropolis gone crazy, with a fusion of Americana and Japanese, will infulence generations of film makers. But to see the DVD edition, after suffering years of the VHS version, is akin to being given the gift of sight after being blind from birth. From the opening sequence of the cityscape, to the closing shot of the realeased dove, this is a joy. With the classic ensoble cast, and Harrison Ford, given a sript and a character with hidden depth, this is a film that triumphs on every level. All this, then coupled with Ridley Scott's direction, now split from the hideous voiceover, makes this a MUST OWN disc. I have to say also, that a film of this quality deserves a better disc with features, and I hear that one is coming out in the new year. Lets hope that is does the film justice. Channel 4 tv, here in England did a great documentry, and as has been said in other reviews the two versions on the one disc would be great.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|The movie has absolutely no tie to the video game besides the title. The script is horrible, special effects are cheesy, the only thing that attracted people to watch this movie is Jolie's figure. <br />I was really looking forward to this movie, but I ended up sleeping for about 25 minutes during the movie. There were about 2 good action scenes, and thats about it.<br />Never the less, I'm going to buy this movie anyway, only because Jolie looks awsome is the movie, in any movie for that sake.<br />For everyone else, I suggest to rent the movie.

B00003CXXI|5.0|This has got to be the funniest fairy tale I've ever seen.  It takes cues from just about every Disney animated feature film that there's been, and then turns them into a farce.  The ugliest, most unlikely hero ever gets the beautiful princess (not like that hasn't happened before - see Beauty and the Beast), but in this case, she turns out to be a princess who's seen The Matrix a few too many times, has less than Emily Post-like manners, and ends up being ...ugly herself.  BUT THAT'S ALL COOL.  Because in a Disney film, they use the same people over and over for every film, whereas you will never see Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz in a Disney film (although they did have David Spade and John Goodman in Emperor - that was cool).  But I digress.  Shrek is the ultimate nose-thumb to all Disney films.  See it.  Buy it.  Share it with your children.  They will thank you...
B00005ABII|5.0|The third Cake disk, cleverly titled &quot;Prolonging the Magic&quot;, hits hard with thirteen amazing tracks.<br />The album starts off with &quot;Satan Is My Motor&quot;, a song laced with parody and clever lyrics. Most feel the song is a direct refrence to the dark prince himself. Could it be?<br />A soothing rock song &quot;Mexico&quot; follows, creating an atmosphere worthy of a well lit night club.<br />Never There, one of the strongest tracks on the disk follows this, followed by &quot;Guitar&quot; and &quot;You Turn The Screws&quot;.<br />A few happy-go-lucky songs come along. &quot;Walk On By&quot;, and &quot;Sheep Go To Heavan&quot; have great beats, and clever lyrics once again.<br />The most creative track is &quot;When You Sleep&quot;. A song about where people put their hands while in the act of sleeping could only be created by this sacrimento quartet.<br />&quot;Hem Of Your Garment&quot; is next, quoting the Bible, not referring to it. The Bass is heavy and the chorus is amazingly catchy.<br />&quot;Alpha Beta Parking Lot&quot; is calming, and chilling; creating a mood of joyous sorrow. The song leaves an impression long afterwards - much like the aftertaste of a pickle.<br />Afterwards is &quot;Let Me Go&quot;, a love song that proves a point, while making you bob your head.<br />&quot;Cool Blue Reason&quot;'s lyrics are chilling, and mark your mind with footprints. The song instills something of a sad dilemna.<br />And finally, the disk comes to a close with &quot;Where Would I Be&quot;. A touching Love song that, while being a love song, still packs some amazing bass and drums. The eerie sounding introduction makes you lift your head. <br />Beautiful music, Great Lyrics, Amazing C.D.
B00004RF97|2.0|That's my main impression of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, the movie that inspired &quot;High Society&quot;, about a headstrong young heiress and her planned second marriage being complicated by a new suitor and an old ex-husband. I'd heard about this for years, and only ever seen that opening shot of Katharine Hepburn breaking Cary Grant's golf club. Gotta admit, it's a great shot--but it's the only good scene in the whole movie! Wow, did that ever surprise me. I thought Cary was doing a very bad job, almost like the &quot;Wink Cary&quot; I described in my review of &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot;, serious autopilot. Slow-moving movie about a lot of people who think they're clever.

B00005LKIM|2.0|Hannibal is very disappointing. It lacks almost everything that Silence Of The Lambs had. The suspense, the intensity, and the chemistry between the two leads. The only thing this film gives us is violent, gorry, scenes that is ireevelant to the story. Anthony Hopkins is once again mesmerizing and creepy as Dr. Hannial Lector and Juliane Moore is wonderful as Clarice. It is unfortunate that the 2 leads had barely any scenes together except until the final scene. That is what made the first, is the intense interaction between the 2. The scrpit is confusing and there is too much emphasis on the Italian FBI agent trying to capture Hannibal. Ray Liotta is wasted in a role that only allows him to act like a jerk. Through this all I was hoping that there would be an intense ending, but there wasn't, it build and builds and then just ends. Silence of the Lambs is one of the best movies ever made, and they should have just left it at that,and not bothered with this pointless sequel.
B00001OH7U|5.0|'Station to Station' is not one of his better known albums. My only explanation for its relatively low profile in the Bowie canon is that it is not as high-concept as some of his other works, acting mainly as a bridge between the &quot;plastic soul&quot; phase and the more starkly experimental Berlin trilogy. Well, all I can say is it's one hell of a bridge. With only six tracks total, each cut is pretty lengthy; but this isn't a matter of padding. In fact, 'Station' is alone among Bowie albums in its total lack of filler: every song is a monster. This is elegantly performed stuff that finds power in simplicity, even understatement. There are no rock'n'roll suicides here. But Bowie's engagment is intense, both with the material and with his band, an ace assembly of players. Result: he never sounded more confident, never sounded more like a natural.
6305909326|3.0|The Ninth Gate with Johnny Depp is an interesting, involving, thriller dealing with a book written by a heretic and Lucifer himself.  At times excruciatingly long, the Ninth Gate is more like Rosemary's Baby in relation to Satan.  The Devil himself never makes an appearance although his presence can be felt throughout the movie.  If you are not familiar with the Bible, particularly the Book of Revelations, you may be confused by certain characters(the woman following Depp) as well as the storyline.  Unlike the Exorcist, the Ninth Gate does not even show the Devil's handiwork, just the feeling of the presence.  Johnny Depp and Frank Langella make this rather dull movie quite exciting and as always Langella plays an excellant villian.  I would suggest renting it if you don't like to go over movies over time, but The Ninth Gate is a good purchase, the second time viewing it will help you understand the movie a little more and you will be more alert for certain clues than before.

B00004Z459|5.0|After hearing &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;One Step Closer,&quot; I decided to download the other songs to check it out before I buy Hybrid Theory. <br />I got them all, then I had to buy the cd. At first I didn't like the rap mix in the rock, but I gotta tell you it's catchy. After I bought the cd, I couldn't skip one song. They all are really good. Chester Bennington dominates the rock based songs like &quot;One Step Closer&quot; and &quot;Crawling.&quot; Mike Shinoda works the rap vocals. He can spin lyrics with the best of them.<br />I highly recommend Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory for any rock/rap fan. Out of all my cd's, Hybrid Theory is one that I never skip tracks on.

B00005ASIL|4.0|Jethro Tull have created such a vast collection of material over the last 33 years that it is difficult to condense highlights of their career onto one CD. As group leader/flutist/composer Ian Anderson even says in his liner notes, if one were to ask Tull fans to compile a &quot;Best Of&quot; CD then there would be as many different selections as there are fans. It is to Tull's credit that their music is so wide-ranging, from rock to folk to blues with jazz and classical influences et al. thrown in for good measure. But, when it comes to &quot;Best Of&quot; albums...<br />This is not the first Tull compilation, but it is one of the better ones. Okay, Tull &quot;standards&quot; (i.e. those that get regular FM radio play to this day) are included, but they are not among my favorite Tull songs. Still, less-than-dedicated fans who want to own one Tull CD would probably desire &quot;Locomotive Breath,&quot; &quot;Living In The Past,&quot; and &quot;Aqualung.&quot; Thankfully, some more esoteric, recent, and higher quality Tull material is also included here (the majestic &quot;Broadsword&quot; and the bamboo-flute driven &quot;Roots To Branches&quot; - misspelled on the CD cover as &quot;Root To Branches,&quot; but one can't have everything!). This balance of &quot;the hits&quot; and some decent album cuts make this an overall pleasing collection.<br />One major criticism is the cruel editing suffered by &quot;Heavy Horses;&quot; a multi-movement gem in its original form, here it has the guts taken out of it and all that is left is the verses and the choruses.<br />A final thought: on a recent national call-in radio show, a listener asked Tull members Ian Anderson, Martin Barre, and Andrew Giddings to name their favorite Tull songs. Their choices were, respectively, &quot;Budapest,&quot; &quot;Under Wraps #2,&quot; and &quot;Dun Ringill.&quot; None of these are present on this album.<br />That ought to tell someone something...
B00003CXAR|5.0|In this classic movie, I liked how realistic the shark seemed. Just as in &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, man tries to conquer nature, in both cases a beast of the sea. This book may be taken to suggest that man can conquer nature, although incurring destruction in the process, but this is fictional story. In both stories, the beast means no intentional harm, that is just the result of its instinct. There are two technical errors in Jaws. It involves the initial harpooning of the shark to a barrel.  Even though Quint, an experienced seaman, notes upon the shark's first appearance that it is the biggest shark he's ever dealt with, he acts surprised when the shark submerges with one barrel and then with two barrels harpooned into him. After the first barrel is harpooned into the shark, it comes back at night and strikes the boat, with the barrel still on him. The next morning when the shark comes back, there is no barrel and no explanation for its absence. Those are just two minor errors in a great movie.<BR>I found it ironic that Quint, the experienced seaman, the fearless S.O.B., is the only one of the three crew members who are killed by the shark. Also ironic is that the Chief of Police, the one least knowledgable about the sea and sharks and most afraid, (&quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat&quot;) is the one who puts the shark to death.<BR>This movie will be loved for a long time. The TV version has started to censor things it didn't before like swearing and violence, which I think detracts from the quality of the film. The sequels to Jaws just don't compare with the original.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Everything is seductive, here....even though this movie is based on the action packed video game. Lady Craft's role in finding the past, in stopping the bad guy is seduction in itself. The movie starts with her, weapons in hand, dueling, jumping, and kicking a spider-like machine that has been programmed to kill her. This is how she trains. We move on to thieves trying to steal a time machine that her father found. The sequencing of moves, the tricky gadgets, the wicked dancing Buddha in the tomb in Cambodia, the trek to the Artic, the gigantic time machine that slices and dices..... Lady Croft sure handles all of these frolicking adventures with cool wit and grace. Excellent cinematography shows all of these journeys, one following the other. The only thing I found a tad disappointing is the dialogue: bland and undeveloped. But with Jolie in the midst, who is listening? If you like the video games, you'll like this movie.

B00005JK93|5.0|Hedwig is the best movie I have seen in a long time.  The first half is so hilarious, focusing on Hedwig's &quot;club&quot; gigs.  Her humor is biting and witty.  Her outfits and hair are fabulous.  I love it!  The second half shifts gears and focuses on her and Tommy Gnosis, possibly her &quot;other half?&quot;  The scenes with Tommy are the only ones that lack the excitment the rest of the film has.  I've already seen it twice already and I can't wait to see it again.  The soundtrack and book are both great too.  This story of a little slip of a girlyboy from east berlin that becomes the internationally ignored song stylist barely standing before us is the best thing I have seen in years!
0792841344|4.0|My review is the title. I'm using this space as a forum to petition my fellow Phantasmaniacs to urge Universal (or whatever controlling influence) to get Phantasm II on DVD. Who's with me?
0380973650|3.0|I read Neverwhere in 2 1/2 days.  I absolutely loved it.  And I wanted more.  So I bought American Gods as soon as it came out.  Don't get me wrong, American Gods was good, but the sex scenes surprised me, and I felt like the ending sort of left me hanging.  It was ok...not the best I've ever read, certainly not the worst, however.  If you are into mythology, you might really like this one.  My advice, if it intrigues you, go get it from the library before you spend the money on the hardcover.
B000058983|5.0|I do enjoy Arthur Lee and his supper-club phrasing of lysergic koans, the guitars, the session musicianship, and so forth. It's not a sane album and for that we should be grateful. Whether or not it evokes the troubled heart of America in the 1960s I will leave to the liner-note writers of the world.
6303109950|1.0|Inspired by my recent visit to Tombstone (the town), I finally saw &quot;Tombstone&quot; (the movie), which I've heard so much about. Everyone talks about how great it is, especially Val Kilmer's performance as Doctor John Henry Holliday. All I can say is: not nearly as good as the rival project, &quot;Wyatt Earp.&quot;<br />First of all, &quot;Tombstone&quot; is just plain boring. There's no getting around that. Second of all, the character of Wyatt Earp changes so completely too quickly for it to be believable or understandable. At first, he's lecturing his brothers that there is no feeling worse than taking another man's life. He'd never want to have that feeling again, which is why he is so adamant about not returning to law enforcement. Then, out of nowhere, he says to Virgil W. Earp, &quot;maybe you better swear me in.&quot; Where'd that come from? After the gunfight at the O. K. Corral (which, by the way, was so poorly choreographed that I would have had no way of knowing who was fighting the Earps if I hadn't already known), Wyatt temporarily seems to return to his old pacifist self, during a quiet conversation with Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton). But then he makes a COMPLETE reversal, going off on a freakin' killing spree for the remainder of the movie. What the hell happened? I know he's out for revenge, but this movie doesn't set that up as an adequate motivation for a complete character reversal.<br />A word or two (or more) about the cast: Kurt Russell certainly looks like Wyatt, but Sam Elliott is so much older than Kurt and Bill that I had a hard time believing that they were brothers. I don't know, maybe that really was the age difference between Virgil and Wyatt and Morgan, but it just isn't convincing in this movie. As for Powers Booth's performance as &quot;Curly&quot; Bill Brocius, all I can say is, &quot;over the top.&quot; And Jason Priestley seemed too 1990s to play a character from the 1880s. Who the heck was he, anyway? All I know is his name is Billy, although whether he is Billy Clanton, Billy Clayborne, or some other Billy is never established. Finally, I can see why Kilmer's performance won such raves. He is surrounded by performers who seem so detached from their characters that Kilmer looks impressive by comparison. The only character and performance I found really interesting in the whole movie was a minor one: Michael Biehn as John Ringo. He comes across as somehow both likable and menacing. I like how Biehn plays with this dual nature of his character: You never know when he might shoot you or turn around and suddenly start acting like a civilized, reasonable man. If the whole movie was as good as Biehn's performance, I would have liked &quot;Tombstone&quot; a whole lot better. But it's not, so I didn't. If you want to see a movie about this gunfight that is actually good, see &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; instead. It is not flawless, but it is better than &quot;Tombstone.&quot;y, although whether he is Billy Clanton, Billy Clayborne, or some other Billy is never established.

6303421563|5.0|This is one of my very favorite movies. It tells the story of a 12 year old orphan, Mathilda (Natalie Portman) who is taken in by a emotionless hitman named Leon (Jean Reno), when her family is killed by ruthless and insane DEA Agent Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman).<BR>Probably the most dramating action movie I have ever seen, The Professional is the story about a girl who's troubles are just beginning, who is adopted by the man who knows only troubles. Leon has lovable quirks: he has a potted plant that is the only special thing in his life (&quot;It is like me,&quot; he states, &quot;It has no roots.&quot;) and Mathilda is a lifelike and realistic character. Even though Leon is a hitman, he seems like a lesser evil and pales in comparison to the venemous insanity of Stansfield.<BR>Reno brilliantly acts Leon's part and Portman steals the show with her astounding portrayal of Mathilda. Gary Oldman, one of my favorite actors, sends chills down the spine when he takes drugs and then rasps about insects in the grass and beethoven, and when he screams in the face of his men to &quot;Bring me EVERYONE!!!&quot;<BR>I definitely reccomend The Professional for everybody except small children (there is no really graphic violence, nudity or sex.)
0553208845|5.0|Hesse was not very comfortable with the existence he found. His early books show unhappy and disillusioned youth struggle and find nothing that satisfies. It is no surprise that the youth of our counry in the sixties latched on to Hesse as an avatar that told its story before they lived it. His books struggle with issues you will find familiar regardless of your heritage or the time you were born to. It is the spiritual quest, and the quest for knowledge and all people are seekers. Some give up at some point and resign themselves to what is at hand but Hesse does not. So he can be either disturbing or inspirational depending on where you are in life. His books no doubt appeal more to youth but I think its a mistake to count him out. This book is not religious really, it is philosophical, and Hesse's imagined east is very appealing: In the shade of the house, in the sunshine on the river bank by the boats, in the shade of the sallow wood and the fig tree, Siddhartha, the handsome Brahmin's son, grew up with his friend Govinda. The sun browned his slender shoulders on the river bank, while bathing at the holy ablutions, at the holy sacrifices.(pg.1)<br />Yes, I have thoughts and knowledge here and there. Sometimes, for an hour or for a day, I have become aware of knowledge, just as one feels life in one's heart. ...but this one thought has impressed me, Govinda. Wisdom is not communicable. The wisdom which a wise man tries to communicate always sounds foolish.(pg.115)<br />But Hesse does communicate a wisdom in this book. And the final pages of this book communicate it in a very poetic way that will remain with you.
B00005A46T|5.0|Say what you will about these masked Iowans, but they've truly put forth an astounding effort with this release. Every song is truly amazing, including the remake of &quot;Gently&quot;. I loved the first version from MFKR, and I thought they would destroy it the second time around. They totally changed my mind, the new version is twice as good. Standout tracks include... well, all of them. Every single track. So stop wasting time reading these reviews and JUST BUY THE ALBUM!!
B000000Y59|5.0|Contrary to the views of some Evans' devotees, not all of his recordings are uniformly excellent. Much of the material from the middle of his career, especially, suffers from a kind of overly busy virtuosity and sterile, introspective approach to the same material. But this album measures up well against the best Evans' recordings--the early Vanguard sessions as well as the late Paris concert. In fact, it's a &quot;studio&quot; version of the same telepathic trio recorded live on the Vanguard session. But here the piano's sonorities are fuller, richer, and Evans' solo voice is more prominently featured. In fact, I find this the best album to use when demonstrating Bill's special genius to &quot;outsiders.&quot; &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine,&quot; the very first tune, showcases his luminous tone and clustered left-hand voicings; &quot;Autumn Leaves,&quot; the second tune, beautifully illustrates the &quot;democratic&quot; role of each of the three players, alternating ensemble polyphony with straight-ahead 4/4 swing. For the collector who's already acquired &quot;Live at the Vanguard&quot; and &quot;The Paris Concert,&quot; this is certainly worth considering as the next addition to a collection of Evans' best recorded work.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I really enjoy this album. I have been a fan of Santana for a long time and have a few of the early albums. This is, to say the least, a bit of a departure from Santana's early stuff, although there is still plenty of Carlos' wonderful guitar playing to satisfy old fans. Yes, this album was geared somewhat to the younger generation, in the use of top r&amp;b and rock vocalists like Dave Matthews, Rob Thomas, Everlast, Lauryn Hill and Eagle-Eye Cherry, but there is nothing wrong with that. I know a few young people, who, after hearing this album, purchased some of Santana's earlier albums. This is an album that works, and for all the good reasons. The songs are all good, and there's plenty of variety. It deserved the Grammy for sure. Recommended.
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you don't know Allison Krauss and Emmylou Harris now, you will surely be their fans once you've heard this CD.  This is the most awesome CD to come out in many years.  The movie would have been barely &quot;so-so&quot; had it not been for this collection of stunning songs.  The haunting &quot;Let's go down in the river to pray&quot; by Allison is beyond - far beyond - anything you've ever heard.

0345423496|1.0|The reason science-fiction exists is largely to comment on modern issues by placing them in a sci-fi context (well, that and the neat-o laser guns), but this book goes so overboard. There really isn't any story, David Poole's character isn't memorable enough to be even a cliche, the science is foolish. Instead it's mostly David Poole wandering around what Mr. Clarke considers to be a utopia. Basically it's an excuse for Mr. Clarke to deliver self-righteous sermons about the 20th century, that are unfailingly childish and annoying. <br />For example, nobody in the future is religious, they even shrink from the mention of god. The reason why is because a past pope released secret church documents on the cruelties of the Spanish Inquisition. People around the world were so shocked at the hypocricy that they simultaneously gave up on religion. I remember another utopia of Clarke's in Childhood's End, where racial difficulties were ended by black people being commonly referred to with a certain racial epithet, but not complaining about it. Both these examples are childish, offensive, and don't even make any sense - how did they make it past an editor?<br />I read this book because I enjoyed the author when I was very young. Now I know better, and believe this to be the worst book I've ever read, by an author who has no real talents other than milking his association with Stanley Kubrick's 2001.
0881036277|5.0|To me Hemingway epitomizes the hard drinking, hard living, hard loving, worldy writer. In this book, the main character Robert Jordan is a soldier send on a mission to the hills of Spain to blow up a bridge. There, Jordan meets up with a rogue band of warriors who believe in war but not in military. Once united with the militia, Jordan becomes involved with a woman named Maria. The fight scenes are incredible. The ending is even more incredible. I'm not going give away the book, but the ending  brought tears to my eyes- I guess it's true, underneath every man of steel is a heart of gold.
1572522232|4.0|The hype surrounding this movie gives it pretty high standards with which to live up to and though it wasn't everything I had heard it to be, it is a horror masterpiece.  To quickly give a plot summary, a girl from America flys overseas to attend a european ballet school.  Things start out strange as the first night, as it is pouring rain, a girl runs out of the ballet school in a panicked state just as the American girl is arriving by cab.  Instead of being allowed in, the American girl is refused entrance and is forced to come back the next day where, contrastly, she is eagerly greeted and taken in.  She is informed that two of the student are dead, one being the girl she saw the night before.  Once settled in, she begins noticing strange occurences and becomes very suspicious of her new home and seeks to find out what is going on.  The plot is good, made better by the acting, but it isn't what makes the movie a masterpiece.  The eerie ballet school, superb camerawork, creepy atmosphere created by red and green lights and possibly one of the best horror scores make is just a brilliant work of horror.
6305508550|5.0|I thought this was a hella funny movie.  I was busting up frequently during this because so much related to the hell hole I work in.  The cubes, the zoning out, the hating of the job, etc. was easy to relate to.  I thought the other two guys were funny too.  If you work in a cube cage, you will totally relate to this movie. Mike Judge rules.

B00003CY3W|5.0|This is a lovely ode to those who are disfranchised by being a nonconformist.<br />This movie is a clear look at the forces that come to bear on those that &quot;stray from the mainstream&quot;.<br />The humour is dry and pithy. Parts of the movie are incredibly cruel and hilarious at the same time.<BR>&quot;du sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas&quot;<br />Thora Birch does an wonderful job at carring the audience through a wide range of emotional landscapes.<br />Scarlett Johansson completes the the set. She anchors near the edge without being swept away.<br />Notice: This movie includes a fine example of the Americian Mullet.<br />One thing of note. This movie is a visual pleasure. In an age where blowup sets and CGI are the rule, this movie is a gem of great price.<br />I am a geek, a dork and I'm 50. This movie touched me.
B00003CXN3|4.0|First of all I am shocked at all the negative reviews for this movie. I thought it was the 3rd best movie of the year next to CROUCHING TIGER AND REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. If you havent seen REQUIEM FOR A DREAM GO RENT IT NOW. It is not only the best anti-drug movie ever made it is also one of the most intense and powerful films ever put to cinema.<br /> Now for Traffic. There was one major flaw,casting Micheal Douglas. He is typical Douglas,over acting and overly dramatic. Other than that it was an interesting movie. Benicio Del Toro gives a suttle yet powerful performance as a good cop seeing all the corruption around him. He is the only character who you feel for. He is the moral conscience of the film. Soderbergh did a great job directing this epic film. Both he and Del Toro deserved the awards they got. <BR> I dont understand some of these reviews. Did they even watch the movie? One guy made it sound like a pointless action film. Another said it was unrealistic.Back up these harsh statements!<br />    BELIEVE ME FOLKS YOU WILL NOT FIND A FILM WITH MORE SOCIAL COMMENTARY AND RELEVANCE ALL YEAR. EXCEPT OF COURSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.

B00005B4GU|5.0|This to me personally is Radioheads second best cd. I believe OK COMPUTER to be their masterpiece. This cd is to me a good combo of certain atmosphere from Kid A and The Bends. But it really doesnt have many similarities to any of their Cd's. I dont know why there are so many negative reviews for this. It doesnt come off as being as overly pretentious like Kid A was and it is more subtle than their concept album Ok Computer. If you are a Radiohead fan who was dissapointed because Kid A was too astray from thier rock roots,purchase this. <br />        BY THE WAY,TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAY KID A IS GROUNDBREAKING, BUY ANY ALBUM BY BJORK. SHE IS THE MOST ORIGINAL ARTIST TO COME OUT OF THE NINETIES AND THE NEW MILLENIUM BY FAR. SHE STARTED A SCHOOL MOST ARTISTS WILL NEVER GRADUATE FROM.
B000000OS2|5.0|One of the more annoying trends of the early '90's (along with the dominance of grunge) was to have artists &quot;unplug&quot; their music and show a more &quot;sensitive&quot; side to things.  It was so contrived and unspontaneous that it became downright tedious.  However, before any of that happened, one of the greatest, most underrated hard rock bands in history decided to unplug--and did so with great success.  This album is anything but contrived, and despite it's unplugged nature is still quite rocking.  I was instantly blown away when I heard the opening track &quot;Comin' Attcha Live&quot; break into &quot;Truckin'&quot; (and I'm not even a Grateful Dead fan).  Same thing when &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;--a great Beatles' cover--turns into the classic &quot;Signs&quot;, which Tesla has made a legendary hit of their own.  It is remarkable to hear the way such songs as &quot;Before My Eyes&quot; and &quot;Paradise&quot; came across accoustically as compared to their electronic counterparts.  Just an incredibly spirited performance from a band that has always done it right.  Now, 11 years after this release, I look forward to an electric double-CD set from this band that will be out soon.  Tesla is indeed back together!  For me, they never truly went away, with masterpieces such as this.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|i had seen the movie three times, and then bought the cd. i fell in love with both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. \\"elephant love medley\\" and \\"come what may\\" are so wonderful. i love it when both of them sing together. and \\"one day i'll fly away\\" and \\"el tango de roxanne\\" are just the kind of songs that stick in your head forever. i also loved the \\"spectacular spectacular\\"song, \\"like a virgin\\" and \\"the show must go on\\", which did not appear in the cd. i think it would be nice to include a few lines from the movie in each track. it'll be easier to get into the songs and understand them that way. like, \\"spectacular spectacular\\" would sound hilarious if all the lines of the duke are included. i wish the soundtracks will remind me of the scenes in the movie.
B000002GBB|5.0|I am a big fan of most Styx albums, from their earliest, pre-Tommy Shaw stuff right up through the more &quot;pop-oriented&quot; stuff of the '80's and beyond.  However, to me the most vintage Styx has to be &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; and this album (&quot;Paradise Theater&quot; is not far behind).  With the opening track &quot;Great White Hope&quot;, which starts with Dennis DeYoung &quot;announcing&quot; followed by James Young breaking into song, you can tell that this is going to be quite a ride.  Rarely did Dennis and James collaborate better vocally than on that song.  &quot;Sing For The Day&quot; is a nice mellow Tommy Shaw offering, while &quot;Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)&quot; and &quot;Renegade&quot; are big rocking hits with Tommy on lead.  &quot;Renegade&quot; to me is one of Styx' finest hits ever.  JY rocks again mightily on &quot;Lords Of The Ring&quot;.  I listen to a hard rock song like &quot;Queen Of Spades&quot; and have to wonder why Dennis stopped rocking like this.  He has a great ballad voice but also was a great and very unique rock singer in his day.  This effort as a whole is so diverse and rocking that I find it a very enjoyable and interesting listen right to this day.  The &quot;music critics&quot; who lump this music under the mindless category of &quot;corporate rock&quot; do not know what they are talking about.  Like its predecessor, &quot;Pieces Of Eight&quot; is one of the most original, unique-sounding rock album offerings you could ever hope to listen to.
B000002ORU|4.0|This box set does exactly what a box set is supposed to do.  It offers a history of the band, via both highlights and misfires (e.g. \\"Dogs,\\" which I love BUT...it seems to have driven the band insane, and it's just a novelty song).  To those who claim that a box set should offer \\"definitive studio versions\\" of the best tracks, and that one function of a box set is to provide a comprehensive overview for listeners who've never heard this music before... I retort that new listeners are NOT the primary market for these collectors' items.  Why would anyone spend [this money] on a box set by some band they've never heard before?  Ludicrous notion.  On the other hand, a consumer expects superior sound quality when he's shelling out [this much money], no matter what a bargain that price might be from an aesthetic standpoint.  I actually have the box set on cassette tapes, and it sounds OK in my car.  But my main point is that a box set is just a box full of CDs (usually including a book of fan's notes by Dave Marsh) and has no intrinsic duty to be sonically exquisite, tasteful, comprehensive, or whatever.  Maximum R&B is designed as a chronological overview of the Who's career, and it succeeds extremely well at charting the band's rise and fall with consistently interesting musical samples.  When I first heard the set I was blown away - it had been 10 years since I'd grown tired of my half-dozen classic Who LPs, and I'd forgotten how good their music really was/is.  Unfortunately I came to the band late, after their heyday, and I never saw them live or else I'd not have forgotten the experience I'm sure.  Bottom line:  This is a superior multi-disc set.  It's unique, it's the Who, and most importantly it's as musically coherent as a chronological survey can be - not an inferior collection of rarities and half-baked versions-in-development of the band's \\"hits,\\" but more like a set of several very good Who LPs you've never heard before.  (4 compact discs translates to about7 LPs.)  Regretfully I dock the set one star for the cover of Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting that closes the program.  \\"Anticlimax\\" doesn't begin to express the dismal effect of that flashy clunker.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I grew up in the '80's, the music of my day being the &quot;guitar rock&quot; of the '70's and heavy metal and &quot;pop metal&quot; of the '80's. The Beatles, while I always acknowledged their esteemed place in rock 'n roll history, were a band that (in my view at the time) was absurdly overplayed on adult contemporary and classic rock stations. I didn't want to hear anymore about their &quot;greatness&quot;.<br />Years have passed, and I am more than ever a connoisseur of various eras of rock music. While I rarely dip back as far as the '60's, the Beattles are an obvious exception.  How, then, to choose a Beatles album of choice? That of course is impossible, as they have too many albums that are &quot;representative&quot; of their greatness. That is why for me, an overall serious rock music fan but nonetheless just a casual fan of this legendary band, this collection is about perfect. Yes, there are dozens and dozens more well-known great songs by this band, but this collection of &quot;worldwide # 1's&quot; offers a nice slice of Beattles music. Also great packaging with the pictures of the singles inside. Surely a starting point for new generations who will no doubt grow up knowing who the Beattles were and what they meant to our culture and rock history.
B000058983|5.0|Well... here's a problem: an indispensable late 60's album that is regularly rated in industry polls as amongst the best of all time for good reasons, one of which is that the original record just flowed from start to finish. So, now we have an excellent digital re-mastering that enhances the original tracks by fully revealing their extraordinary intricacies - particularly the group's use of multiple acoustic guitars - but which also includes seven bonus tracks that range from the intriguing to the essential.<br />The problem?... well, a key feature of the original LP was its sequencing with side two building-up to the final ecstatic fade out on it's last cut - \\"You Set the Scene\\" - leaving the listener, quite deliberately, to reflect in the silence that followed. On this version there's not much time for reflection before being jarred back into reality by bonus tracks that weren't on the original because they weren't good enough, weren't recorded yet or didn't fit. And, while there's nothing wrong with \\"Laughing Stock\\" and the fabulous \\"Your Mind And We Belong Together\\" and, for Love fans, real interest in the other alternate mixes and unreleased workouts that have been added to this version, the truth is that they shouldn't be there! Subtle but important stuff when dealing with a carefully crafted masterpiece. The solution?... pretty simple really: program your CD player to stop after track 11, but it's a pain to remember and, for first time recruits, an unlikely event.<br />Here's an idea: with \\"classic\\" records that deserve this kind of meticulous re-mastering (and which have usually been elevated to such high status precisely because they worked so well as a unified whole) why not put the bonus tracks on a separate disk - the cost can't be that great and the benefits would be enormous. In the meantime have your programming finger at the ready to savour the full impact of this magnificent slice of musical genius.
B000001FYZ|5.0|Some Scorpions fans criticize this album because &quot;Winds Of Change&quot; became a huge ballad hit, and another ballad &quot;Send Me An Angel&quot; also made a dent on pop radio. My answer to that is: so what? Listen to the whole album--it rocks! How can you go wrong with songs like &quot;Don't Believe Her&quot;, &quot;Kicks After Six&quot;, and &quot;Hit Between The Eyes&quot;? The Scorpions have nearly always put a ballad or two on their albums; this album shouldn't be downgraded just because we got sick of hearing one of them on the radio. (Besides--now that it is never played anymore, &quot;Winds Of Change&quot; sounds good again in my opinion.) For sure this album stands right up there with any previous Scorpions efforts. Like most of its predecessors, a classic hard rock album.
B00005J7VJ|5.0|This shuffling, bustling fusion of acid-jazz &amp; blues, based on clever sampling and superbly tight playing, demands attention first time through and, like all great records, just gets better &amp; better with repeat listening. And... if you've got the extra cash and your dancing shoes on buy this import version rather than the standard US version for it's second CD containing three excellent club re-mixes - in particular the extended version of \\"Sure Thing\\" with it's quite marvellous John Lee Hooker sampled vocals. Wonderful stuff!
B000002IKR|5.0|This album is metal. It almost sounds like Slayer on a few of the songs. I recomend it to anyone that likes speed and thrash metal. This is surely one of TestAmenT's greatest albums ever. They are the masters of pinch harmonics. WAHH!
B00004SU5J|5.0|Out there in musicland's vaults there's some great albums just waiting to be found... and here's one! A shuffling, bustling fusion of acid-jazz &amp; blues based on clever sampling and superbly tight playing that demands attention first time through and, like all great records, just gets better &amp; better with repeat listening. Along with Suba's latin:hip-hop \\"Sao Paulo Confessions\\", Ernest Ranglin's afro:jazz \\"Modern Answers to Old Problems\\" and Kenny Burrell's classic jazz on \\"Midnight Blue\\" - all discovered this year - Saint Germain's \\"Tourist\\" grabs repeated space on my CD player and will on yours. And... if you've got the extra cash and your dancing shoes on buy the import version for it's second CD containing three excellent club re-mixes - in particular the extended version of \\"Sure Thing\\" with it's quite marvellous John Lee Hooker sampled vocals. Wonderful stuff and proof positive that however much you think you know there's more!

B000002J09|5.0|In the annals of Rock history 1,000 years from now - the 1950's will be represented by Elvis Presley, the 1960's by The Beatles and the 1970's by Led Zeppelin. No hit singles - but defined by a whole series of distinctive and differing albums. With the exception of 'In through the out door' they are all great recordings and are the bench marks against which few come close. Led Zep IV is the at the pinnacle of these recordings. Three albums preceded it, and three - 'Houses of the holy', 'Physical Grafitti' and 'Presence' followed it. The Magnificent Seven no less. What seperates IV from these however is only fully comprehendable when played from start to end. 'Black Dog' is quite possibly the best of the bunch. It rocks and the rift is to die for. The link up with Plant's searing vocal is spine chilling. Bonzo and J.P. hold it so tight behind that the track is anchored and from that position it just takes off !!<BR>Straight into 'Rock n' Roll' which surely would / should have been a Single Release at the time knocking tossers like Bowie into the shade and becoming a worldwide No 1 hit. Hey, the best bit is that they didn't suck up to Record Company men by releasing it. Being a lifetime Zep fan is like being in a special club. Sometimes the best things are not worth trying to explain to lesser mortals. They either discovered such beauty or they didn't and instead followed Bowie, Rod, Elton or Bolan in the misguided belief that THAT was rock n' roll!! 'The battle of Evermore'is Folk - rock and so delicate that to cover it would be impossible.<BR>'Stairway to Heaven' - it's all been said by others - UNTOUCHABLE.<BR>'Misty Mountain Hop' is a stormer and gets side 2 off to the raucos romp that side 1 had done. No lesser side than the first - it has a life of its own and does not merely replicate the successful formula adopted on the first. 'Four Sticks' is another little gem with Bonzo to the fore. 'Going to California' is quite possibly the best track i have ever heard live. That was during the 1998 Page'Plant tour at Wembley Arena. Stunning.<BR>'When the Levee breaks' is absolutely ballbreaking and is cataclysmic in its dynamics. Again i recall the first time that i heard this track on the first play of the Lp. I thought this was even better than 'Stairway .........' and to be honest i cannot find many reasons to rate it much less than that track. Probably the only reason against it is that niether Page or plant wrote the song but that is not much of a reason. Written in the 1920's apparently and who represents that decade?

0345350499|5.0|this book is the 1st one in a long time that i can't put down. maybe since i read The Virgin Suicides, &amp; that was months ago! i knew next to nothing about Morgan Le Fay, etc before this book, &amp; was worried that that would hold me back, but not at all. the characters are great, they have many sides, the setting is beautiful, the writing, amazing. all the good adjectives you can think of are in this book.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|I went to see this movie with my dad and my brother, I believe we were thinking the same thing, a female Indiana Jones, we were wrong, way wrong.  First off the action scenes, I don't really know what this new directing style is of putting 100 or so cameras in a room and switching camera ever second or two, it was going so fast I almost threw up my pop and popcorn.  Is that what they wanted me to do?  I hope not.  Another thing, in Indiana Jones, no matter which one you pick, almost every 15 minutes he's running into another problem...  Stay away from this, do yourself a favor.
B00005MAM2|5.0|This movie first got me started in anime and manga. This work of art is a masterpeice. Akira is a story of Psycic Powers, motercycle gangs, corrupt government and the horrific vision of Neo-Tokyo. In it's release on July 16th 1988 (in Japan), It was a hit, state of the art sound, picture, and animation made it No. 1 box office hit the day it was released. For the US it came out in 1989 from a company called Streamline Pictures which introduced Akira and other Animes into the US. US Critics think the anime industry began on July 16th 1988 because anime was never very popular until Akira's release. The Akira I'm talking about though is the version im rating right now. It's Digitally remasterd through a film cleaning proscess which removes all unwanted dirt and scratches. The sound is remasterd through THX and Dolby Digital 5.1. This is a masterpeice and I think that if your an Anime fan or sombody not afraid to try somthing new, you sohuld take a look into AKIRA

B00003CY3W|5.0|I highly doubt we'll see a better performance this year. This was my most-anticipated movie of the year (i'm a giant fan of the comic) and it didn't disappoint in one single category. a brave, awesome, and hilarious film. I saw it twice in one week, and I haven't seen a movie twice in its opening week since &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot;
B000002U8G|5.0|after listening to Animals, I thought I'd give meddle a try.<BR>Well this is one one my favorites by far. and echoes what tune.<BR>well I would say buy any and every floyd cd you can they are all great, you'll never be dissapointed. I just wish they would get back together again.
0553208845|5.0|This book is amazing.  This was a choice I had for summer reading and I was reluctant to read it thinking, &quot;it's just a dumb new age book.&quot; I was very pleasantly surprised.  It's and incredible read.  It's quick but after I read it, I had a new outlook on life.  Anyway, read this book.
6304383177|5.0|This is a must see.  It has a great storyline and is really funny.  It's a real classic movie.  They don't make them like this anymore.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  It's got great humor.  Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn are marvelous in it.
B0000025JT|5.0|Barbra Streisand performing Disco-esque Pop songs with BG arrangements and back up vocals? Sounds like a train wreck just waiting to happen.  Surprisingly it turns out to be one of Barbra's most fabulous albums.  Unlike other albums where she controlled almost every part of the music arrangement and orchestration Barbra gave total control to Barry Gibb and trusted him to use her voice in a positive way.  He came through with 9 great songs, she came through with some of her most involved passionate singing since the Way We Were album.  Even an album for people who DONT like Barbra because the style of the album is such a departure from what Barbra normally does.
0790743507|5.0|This is a must see musical for the entire family.  The first musical I ever saw.  I would give it ten stars if I could.  It's great and I highly recommend it.  They sure don't make them like this anymore!
6305538018|4.0|David Cronenberg has always been an unpredictable filmmaker, and even after 25 years in the business, his unique visions show no signs of decay.  The possibilities of the human body used for malevolent purposes fueled his &quot;Shivers&quot; and &quot;Rabid&quot;; the eerie drama of the human subconscious punctuated &quot;Dead Ringers,&quot; &quot;Naked Lunch,&quot; and &quot;Crash.&quot;  With &quot;eXistenZ,&quot; Cronenberg takes eager aim at the future and questions our reality in a film that's devoid of flashy, computer-generated EFX and mindnumbing violence (*ahem*, &quot;Matrix&quot;), but is exciting and intelligent all the same.<br />The plot concerns a Virtual Reality game designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) previewing a new system--'eXistenZ'--to the public, but things go horribly wrong when a would-be assassin puts her on the lam with a P.R. nerd (played by Jude Law).  For the rest of the film, this odd couple wanders about the VR world, occasionally coming out of the game, to the point where the line between fantasy and reality is blurred (the last shot in the movie only reinforces it).<br />Cronenberg has gathered possibly his best cast here, getting a lot of mileage out of familiar faces (including Willem Dafoe, Christopher Eccleston, Don McKellar, and Ian Holm, among others).  And even though the acting is occasionally overwrought and laughable, the director doubles back in the final sequence, critiquing his work with tongue planted firmly in cheek.<br />Perhaps most importantly, &quot;eXistenZ&quot; proves that FX don't necessarily insure a more 'futuristic' film.  Through subtle camera techniques, Cronenberg successfully merges from one level of reality to another with an expert hand.  Unlike &quot;The Matrix,&quot; which impressed me only on a technical level and left my brain hollow afterward, &quot;eXistenZ&quot; is for cerebral moviegoers, people who demand a little more than chic black leather and slow-motion bullets to propigate a satisfying experience.rience.
B00005K3O4|4.0|This movie is really great. Clowns that kill you with popcorn guns, cotton candy caccoons. What else do you need? It starts out where the clowns land on earth in a giant circus tent then some farmer finds the tent and the clowns go on a human killing spree. It's rather interesting and if you ever have time to see this movie it's well worth it. A very innovative film and you won't be disappointing. It features all types of great clowns too short ones, fat ones, skinny ones, tall ones, male and female clowns everything. It's mad circus fun.  Bottom line you can't miss this one.
0671024256|5.0|As one of my favorite authors, Stephen King has never ceased to amaze me with his masterful craft of fiction (The Shining, Bag of Bones) and nonfiction (Danse Macabre). He follows with On Writing, the latest trump card from the artist of mass-audience literature, a memoir both of writing and his own strange life.<br />In the book, King offers sound and sage advice for people looking to break into the world of writing, following closely the exploits of a fictional author-to-be in several real-world situations, including the writing process itself, finding a market for your work, and the dreaded cover/query letter. Through it all, he remains entertaining and engaging enough so as never to bore, and the chapters on grammar are accessible to everyone, even those (like me!) who have a hard time remembering what the rules are. He also manages to slip in the hardest advice for any writer: kill your darlings, and by all means, LISTEN TO ADVICE. If only more writers could learn this (I am no exception), there would be a lot less bad poetry at coffee houses - or a lot less coffee houses, period.<br />The second part of the book is devoted to King's two personal struggles - his cocaine and alcohol addiction, and his injury and recovery after being struck by a van in 1999. Here, he changes into a wistful but analytic mode, presenting the facts but not attempting to make himself look like a saint or a victim. A refreshing change from celebrities who blame everyone but themselves for their problems - and don't bother to help themselves, either. This part moves along at a steady clip, and will certainly rival autobiographies of other authors - Nabokov's Speak, Memory comes to mind.<br />For an aspiring writer, On Writing is a sound investment. For a King fan, it is indispensable. For fun, it's worth every penny. Pick it up, give it a read - you won't be disappointed.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This was an excelent film.  The story and acting was great.  It also seems like the creators were shooting for the feel of a full length Three Stooges feature film w\plot.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Goonies still rock!  My jaw dropped when I saw the pirate ship set again.  They really do not make films like this anymore. CGI should stand for (Cashcows Gone Insane), because what was done on this film with just a modest budget far surpasses most $100million epics from the past decade...  Kids deserve entertainment that widens the avenue of the imagination, not weakens it. Parents take note: If this film was made today it would have received a PG-13 rating.  You tell me if that's a good thing. I for one don't.  This is how kids really act and really sound.  If you deny that, you deny reality. Fantasy should highlight reality, not glaze over it.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I had heard &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; on the Pure Moods 2 C.D. and thought that if this song was as good on this one the rest of the c.d. would be comparable.  I was amazed at the fact that not only was it comparable, it exceeded my views on the &quot;Enigma sound&quot;.  They had surpassed the sound of their first album &quot;MCMXC A.D.&quot; and enhanced what they had produced from &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot;.  This cd not only has a good beat and rhthym it also gets you moving especially when you are having a bad day.  I thoroughly enjoy listening to it and will continue to listen to it.

6304007523|5.0|The 1st part in the beatiful Rocky series is perhaps the best. Starring Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa and Talia Shire(The Godfather parts I-III) as his girlfriend Adrian. The movie was loved by everybody. It recieved three Academy awards for best picture best director John G Avildsen and best editing. It spawned four blockbuster sequals from 1979 until 1990. Stallone,Shire and Burt Young starred in all five movies. Carl Weathers who played Apollo Creed in 4 of them. Burgess Meredith's carachter Mickey died in Rocky III but came back in Balboa's mind in the fifth movie. The movie's about a underdog fighter from Philadelphia who all of a sudden gets a shot at the heavyweight title with Apollo Creed after the real challenger suffered from an broken hand. Rocky trains really hard for 5 weeks and goes the distance with Creed, thats something that no one has ever done before. I am a true fanatic of the Rockymovies and I love all of them for it's feeling. The acting in this movie is superb. Stallone,Shire,Young and Meredith all got a Academy award nomination each. It's too bad they didn't win!<BR>I have also written a review for Rocky IV.
B00004ZD69|5.0|on their 2 LP, godspeed you black emperor! molds elements of rock and classical to create an very emotional album. but beware, this album may be hard to swallow for some. if you are already experienced with this 'post-rock' genre, you will enjoy this album. but, if you have typically listened to more &quot;mainstream&quot; genres of rock music, this may not be for you. i have heard from many that this album is boring and repetitious. this may be true. on lift your skinny fists... 4 tracks are spread out on 2 discs, filled with waves of swaying string movements and marvelous climaxes of distorted guitars and heavy drums. this album, even though long, has its moments. if you are a patient type and are willing to listen 19 minutes until it picks up. you will enjoy this gorgeous musical experience.
B00005A46T|5.0|I've got to say that this album blew me away the second I popped it into my cd player. I can see that this band is maturing from songs such as &quot;My Plague&quot; and &quot;Skin Ticket.&quot; Even though they don't have the talent or originality as Fear Factory (FUTURE METAL!), they can still get a long way. This album is just SIC.

B00003CX5P|2.0|What can I say? Lucas falls flat. Sure the film looks beautiful but it has no magic like the first three. Gone is the shoot em up space cowboy thriller of before and replaced with a kids movie with adorable Jar Jar Binks. The enemies are droids so with the exception of Darth Maul there are no real fatalities in this film. What happened to legions of Storm Troopers and planets being destroyed. Instead, we have a cream puff movie where the end is all happy and laughs and no one is left no laughing. This would have been great as a Scooby Doo episode!
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix defies all barriers in cinematic moviemaking. I'm not saying that the acting is simply superb and is Oscar worthy but the special effects are what all the buzz is about. The directors Larry and Andy Wachowski skillfully use the infamous &quot;bullet time.&quot; That's when a bullet is shot, time seems to be frozen in individual frames, giving the person being shot at a whole lot of time to dodge bullets. Also, when every karate move is shot, they are made into a piece of art.<BR>The film is about &quot;the Matrix&quot; a computer generated fantasy that our regular world is living in. I don't know if this has any spiritual meaning. A computer hacker junky (Keanu Reeves) is given the opportunity to look at the thing he's been searching for forever the real world. One day, he finds a message on his computer. It says to follow the white rabbit. He does, following a girl with a tattoo, to a club. There he meets Trinity (brilliantly played by Carrie Anne Moss) a girl who will tell &quot;Mr. Anderson&quot; the secrets of the Matrix. One event leads into another. Now, &quot;Mr. Anderson&quot; is Neo of a group of sort of rebels trying to outwit the agents. The agents are a group of three, part of an alien race who took over the Earth a long time ago. Agent Smith, in particular, seems the most bloodthirsty and has a taste for vengeance. The band of rebels include Morpheous, the wise leader and father figure. Then there's Mouse, Cypher, Tank, Dozer, and two others, whose names I seemed to have forgotten. Their mission is to try and show others the real world. Not the Matrix but the world from real eyes. The Matrix II: Reloaded is the sequel. Be prepared for an eye dazzler.
B000002JKA|5.0|I've had this CD for 6 months and it contains the best music I've ever heard. It always seems every time I get through listening to this CD I like it better then the last time I listened to it. The album just has that &quot;grow on you&quot;<BR>effect that is hard to come by these days. Other bands songs become routine after awhile, they are structured the<BR>same. I also appreciate the music that DT created on this CD more when compared to their other albums. It contains a<BR>variety of songs that I think is unmatched by any other DT album. Songs like Scared, Lifting Shadows Off A Dream<BR>and Voices are DT master pieces. There's also those really heavy songs like Lie and The Mirror, they kick arse by the way. The lyrics are the best in my opinion. The Lyrics are written by more than one band member, one thing I really like<BR>about DT. It's nice to have variety of styles to the lyrics, some of my friends think it's stupid to have a singer who<BR>doesn't write his own lyrics. Most bands don't have a singer like James. Compare James to any other rock vocalist<BR>and they will sound very flat. The melodies that James sings, and the amount of vibrato he uses makes him not<BR>just a singer, but a &quot;vocalist&quot;.<BR>I believe the recording is superior to all other DT albums, let me explain. If you look at the picture of the studio in<BR>the album cover, you'll notice how large it is. When listening to the album on high quality speakers the acoustics of<BR>the room become apparent. I think this created more depth in the sound stage because of the airy sounding room.<BR>I think John Prudell &amp; Duane Baron, mixed, produced and recorded the album well. Don't get me wrong SFAM is<BR>recorded well too. But I think Awake's recording has more character and depth too it, even though it's older.<BR>If Mike Portnoy says the new album sounds like a cross between Awake/LTE. You'll hear no complaining out of me.<BR>I can't wait to hear what they've come up with.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Okay, this is not really a review because we all know some people like these movies some don't. And does it really matter what I think. No it matters what you think. Anyway with that in mind. I want to let everyone know who watches their DVD's-as I do on my computer-that the second disk in this two disk set is encoded. That means you CAN NOT play this on your computer. The sad thing is that many more movies are going to be made like this because there are too many cheep, slime balls out there who want to make bootlegg copies of films because they are too cheep to buy them. Anyway, if you use your DVD player on your computer, do on get this two disk version it is not worth it. Wait untill just the one disk comes out. Also, the store won't addmit to this because they don't know. I had to call the manufactuer direct. This should be listed on the DVD box and it is not.
0375703861|4.0|It took me two weeks to read this book, and for the first week I felt I'd discovered my new all-time favorite novel. The narrative is spectacular (what was she when she wrote this -- 22, 23 years old?...amazing, really), the crafting of the story intiguing, and the characters weird and wonderful. I couldn't wait to read more. But somewhere along the way, maybe three-quarters into the story, I felt like the author ran out of ideas, and struggled to tie up her various loose ends. Having said that, I'd read this book again, mostly to see if my first impression is too harsh...perhaps I had unrealistic expectations, given the thrill I experienced during my first week of reading it. The book says a great deal about the painful struggle of assimilation -- for immigrants, the young, the socially awkward and the idealogically estranged. And it says it without guerilla melodrama. Ms. Smith is obviously very talented, and I can't wait to read her next effort.
0780020685|5.0|Akira Kurosawa, the name that many of my friends use when dscribing great directors.  After hearing how George Lucas based parts of STar Wars Episode IV on Kurosawa's &quot;The Hidden Fortress,&quot;  I tried to track it down, but instead, I found &quot;The Seven Samurai.&quot;  Also hailed by many people, I sat down and watched it, and lo and behold, Kurosawa told an involving story!!<br />  Now, someone on this thread was saying that this film is terrible for not having martial arts in it.  Well, not every film from Asia has to have people flying and throwing 100-hand punches.  Kurosawa takes us instead to a place where strategy and example fare much better than anything else.<br />   Set in the time of 16th century Japan, the country is in turmoil, and a lone village has found that in time, a herd of bandits is planning to plunder their village.  The people are distraught, but the village elder suggests that they hire Samurai to protect them.  Several men set out to find such a man or men, however, with the only thing to offer them is three meals a day, their prospects seem dull, until they find one Samurai named Kambei, who decides to help them, but with his knowledge, he feels that a band of Seven Samurai would be needed.  And in time, they find their men: a young disciple(Katsushiro), a master swordsman(Kyuzo), an old friend of Kambei's(Shichiroji), as well as Gorobei, Heihachi, and last but not least, Kikuchiyo, a Samurai who seems a true enigma.<br />  What makes Kurosawa's film work to a degree, is that we do not get these 7 men in just 7 minutes, it takes time and discovery to find the chosen who can defend this village.  Plus, due to the nature of structure, we get to learn about these men and find their ideas, faults and so forth.<br />  These men also seem to uphold a code of conduct, as they are not aggressive to everyone, but also take theri job seriously, such as helping to train the villagers, sharing their meager portions of food with others who would need it and so forth.<br />  The fact that this film was not colorized is also a great incentive.  The black and white does something to the experience that would somehow &quot;cheapen&quot; the film, just as if someone were to colorize &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; or &quot;Schindler's List.&quot;<br />  Overall, this film has leaped onto my top 25 list, and is one of those films that truly shows action, courage, and a number of qualities missing from action/drama films of today.
6305718954|1.0|When I saw the previews ( before the movie came out ) I could not wait to see it.. Whoever put together the previews for this movie should win an award, he/she made this move look like it was going to be the \\"NEXT EXORCIST\\" which by the way is a great movie! After seeing it in the theater, I was totally let dowm, you keep waiting for something to happen, but it never does. [...]DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY RENTING IT, AND WHATER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY IT! You will be better off taking you money and burning it!
B00005O5N1|4.0|I read the book first, and could _not_ understand why it was selling millions of copies. I just found Bridget Jones extremely boring and stupid. Then I went with some friends to see the film, and came out as a true fan. The film is a lot different from the book, and it works sooo much better. Faster, funnier, more humour, less weight obsession, less parents, and very Pride and Prejudice-like, but I think that's good. <BR>You recognise many things from the book but there are also new stuff, like half the plot for example. But it's excellent! We all left the movie in a great mood, happy and laughing, and I reread the book which I now can stand just because of the great film. <BR>And the actors are fantastic! My favorite is Colin Firth as Mark Darcy. Yum. <BR>All this together just made Bridget Jones sail right up to the top of my feel good-movies list. See it!
B00003CXSM|3.0|I sat though this movie and nearly went to sleep, my wife ended up buying this one! The plot(pretty thin) hits you in the first 5 minutes, it managed to keep me awake with its little twists and turns. The movie focuses on the wedding planner Maria (Jennifer Lopez), who falls in love with (Matthew McConaughey) who plays a doctor (strech) who happens to save her from being cleaned by a dumpster (I wish), After going out with him, she is wanting to jump his bones until she finds out that he is the groom in the wedding she is putting together.<br />Through the movie, the characters search for what they see best for both of them, with funny results.<br />You bet it's not an Oscar winner, but one that you can watch again and again especially if your wife buys it.
B00005KFUM|5.0|Radiohead are my favourite band of all times but lately they drowned in an electronic ocean. Muse are the best alternative to the fans of the old radiohead, the radiohead of ok comupter and the bends. This album remindes me alot of ok computer and each and every track of this album is just beautiful. If you miss the old radiohead then this is a must but if you like the new radiohead then medicore electronic cd's are prudocesed at masses today.
B00005AREQ|4.0|Though BLOW BY BLOW had antecedents in the seminal heavy fusion of Coryell, Cobham, Larry Youngs Spaceball, etc, for Jeff Beck this was a quantum leap forward in sound, an inspired mix of styles/genres that not only works, but single-handedly made the all-instrumental rock album, heavy on lead guitar, commercially viable. BLOW BY BLOW featured Beck out of his usual guise - noise merchant strangling his Strat - and his artistic restlessness leads him into subtler and more varied hues of playing on such diverse offerings as &quot;You Know What I Mean&quot; (jagged-edge funk), &quot;Scatterbrain&quot; (high-powered fusion) and &quot;Cause We've Ended As Lovers&quot; (permafrost blues), to cite only three. This opened the doors-of-perception of any number of guitar-hero acolytes at the time (quite a few journeys towards the inner mounting flame pitstopped at this album for refueling on the way), as well as cementing Beck firmly in the all-time Guitar Pantheon. People who don't know guitar players from Adam know who Jeff Beck is - at least partially, if not mostly, due to this terrific album. To some of us who bought this on vinyl Way Back When, BLOW BY BLOW's huge sales and high profile are hopeful signs that now and again, even if by accident, the public-at-large actually gets it.
B000050XEI|3.0|i'm sorry i liked enyas albums. but she is really is beginning to sound devoid of new ideas. everything on this cd is &quot;same ol same ol&quot;. this sounds so stale and lifeless.she is just going thru the motions.give me watermark anyday
B000002JSJ|5.0|PRESENCE represents a high-water mark, not just in the Zep catalog, but in 70s hard rock albums. Each of the album's 7 tracks is fully-realized, lovingly-crafted and unique from the others. It's like a clinic in the hard-rock form as you get essentially seven different approaches: the misty-mountain battle cry &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; (which sounds like what Robert E Howard might've heard playing in his head while he typed Conan stories); stop-and-start mating-shuffle &quot;For Your Life&quot;; the heavy-psych, Elvis-under-strobe-lights groove of &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot;, and the effects-laden distorto-stomp of &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; are four examples of why I consider this the greatest of all Zeppelin albums. Not only are the songs among Page and Plant's most fertile creations, but the listener is afforded a long look at how brilliant and visionary a knob-twiddler Page had become. Although PRESENCE was written and recorded in a scant few weeks (to recapture some lost immediacy), Page's production is dense and masterful - a testament to all the years of studio time he'd logged over the years, sounding as if seven different producers had overseen one track apiece! The sometimes-too-thin sound that had marred prior albums was gone, replaced by pure fat-bottomed thunder, anchoring the vocal and guitar flights like no Zeppelin album previous. This album was the Zoso crew's farewell to hard-and-heavy rock, followed as it was by the gentler melodic sensibility of IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR; which is only fitting as PRESENCE represents Led Zeppelin's defining statement in heaviness. If you haven't yet heard it, arrange to do so.
0805047905|5.0|This is a great book for the very young because of the bright illustrations and for toddlers learning animals and colors.  A favorite at our house.
B00005A46T|5.0|Slipknot's best cd. It's straight ahead aggression that has flow. I have to say this is the first album I have bought in along time where I have not had to utilize the skip forward button. I like this better than their s/t release for a few reasons. Iowa's songs are direct and too the point, the s/t release had some songs that gradually built up which caused a boring lull at times. I am not saying the s/t had boring songs on it, quite the contrary I loved that cd as well. The point is Iowa is about being in your face more so than in previous releases.  I also got more of an emotional feel coming from the Iowa release as well which added to the intensity. Emotion was a big part of the other 2 releases as well but like I said you feel it more on Iowa. This is a classic so was their last album, this album in my opinion though is Slipknots staple point. Iowa achieves the energy and excitement of the s/t and amplifies it ten fold. Buy this and compare it to the first and you will see what I mean.
B000059HAI|4.0|I watched this again after seeing the new Pearl Harbor and was amazed how much the new version copied TTT, right down to camera angles.   For it's day the special effects were some of the best.<BR>I liked PH especialy for the effects - there were only a couple of real planes and the rest digitized, the downside was having to put up with the sappy love story.
006092988X|5.0|I don't know anyone who did not enjoy this book. It is definetly the greatest book I ever read. It deals with themes like hope, poverty, finding your faith, pride, family issues, patriotism, political issues, and growing up. I was hooked on the first page, it may be 425 pages long, but it felt like 90! I read the book so fast, and I couldn't put it down!!! After reading the last page, I just held onto the book. The story was so moving and it's unforgettable. I'm gonna require all my children to read it.
B00001MXWX|4.0|This is a really good movie if you are just seeing it for the 1st or 2nd time. After that Patrick Stewart looks pretty stupid. Anyone who is a big trekkie, buy it if you havn't seen it before.
6302579295|5.0|If you are looking to enter the world of opera, this is the greatest way to do it.  I use this video with my 4th grade music classes, and although sung in German, the kids love the plot and the music (what's not to like about Mozart?).  The cast is strong all the way around, but for my money Manfred Hamm is the best Papageno I have ever seen.  Great voice, but even better comic acting!  Enjoy this finely staged production of a delightful opera.
B00005K3LU|5.0|Sure, this first installment of the Die Hard trilogy came to theaters 13 years ago, but to add freshness to this classic action ride, director John McTiernan and his crew technical craftsmen and producers have united to bring the power of INTER-action to the DVD viewer in their own home.<br />You, the viewer, can examine and re-examine, review and re-edit bits and pieces of the film in the editor's workshop section.  Believe me, you've never seen anything like this before.  Besides being fun to have the power over what you're manipulating, an added appreciation for the craft of editing is easily achieved.  The entire screenplay is also on the second disk, word for word as it originally was handed to the actors.  This allows the views to see how the script evolved in the hands of those who made the film.  The usual outtakes, bloopers, and deleted scenes are here (fairly standard nowadays), too.  Commentary and behind the scenes words from those who were there are also here for your enjoyment.<br />The best appreciated bonus is the amazing clarity of the digital transfer.  Cinematographer Jan de Bont's dark and moody work is seen sharper and clearer than anything which could have been put on a silver screen in any cinema house.  The full-bodied sound is spectrually sharp and defined.  This is how all film experiences should be.  <br />If you're tired of DVDs which are little more than &quot;theatrical trailer, feature, and scene selection&quot; (and SOOOOO many are just that), then get your hands on this special set right away and see what the DVD experience is all about.  For those who don't yet own DVD, this would be the perfect excuse to invest in a player.  My only warning would be to not expect all these fabulous goodies on every DVD you buy--for now.  I know this set is going to revolutionize the way companies package and &quot;re-package&quot; their upcoming DVD releases.
0800130952|5.0|Hysterical movie. However, this is not for young children. There are some scenes with violence and for a large portion of the movie, the tone is very negative. However, the movie is quite humorous. Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman deliver excellent performances. But the show is stolen by Pam Ferris as Agatha Trunchbull, the school principal and every young child's worst nightmare! Enjoy this movie, but be warned, it is a little of the beaten path!
6305784078|5.0|Alright, so it isn't the best movie in Disney history. But this fanciful, funfilled musical animation was wonderful. Characters such as O'Malley, the sleek alley cat, and Duchess, the sweet, high class kitty, really spiced this movie up. I absolutely adore this movie. So for all those that are thinking 'Ick, this movie (stinks)' I'd recommend seeing it again. This was a great movie, and I think everyone should at least see it for themselves.
B000002KAT|5.0|When I first heard this album in 1970, it immediately struck me as musically fascinating and worth buying. Since then it has grown on me with every playing -- and that must number in the hundreds by now. While I enjoy many of Van's later albums, and especially the live &quot;It's Too Late to Stop Now,&quot; Astral Weeks stands alone as a unique and brillant accomplishment. I only wish that Van had recorded MORE albums like this!<br />Yes, it was recorded in just 2 days in 1968, and maybe if it were recorded with today's technology, over a period of weeks like modern albums, the sound engineers would have softened Van's voice a little. But I can only assume that the people who post reviews saying they &quot;don't like the singing&quot; must not like any classic rock music by people like Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Tom Waits, or Leonard Cohen for example (and I could go on).<br />So critics, if you are going to put down this album, how about telling us what you DO like, so we can figure out where you're coming from. Are you expecting Luciano Pavarotti?
B000023VR6|4.0|Yeah we know this joint ain't good as tha Chronic, but 2001 holds its own.  It could be a little more gansta as the West Coast needs to retake the rap world, but as mentioned, this album is worth getting. Big Ego's is a tight, tight song. The beat for it is off the hook! Maybe the best beat ever? Xplosive is also tight with a really nice beat and the Next Episode iz da bomb ya heard me?!
B000002NAK|5.0|While I am no particular fan of musicals, Madonna's version of EVITA won me over. While she will never be compared vocally to Patty Lapone, she had the built-in moxie and wicked charm to make the Eva-connection and bridge any deficit of vocal talent.<br />I especially appreciate the contributions of Antonio Banderas and Jimmy Nail, who are both energetic singers and make great partners in the drama. I hope they continue making successful films of this genre.<br />So, thanks Madonna for making me see that there is more to music than the 2-minute-plus single. Keep it up, if you're allowed.
B000002LCK|5.0|new order has always been something of a question for me and for alot of people.  the music i think needs no scores or any reviews. if your not one of us who were around for the eighties to remember what it was to hear this band for the first time then you have really missed out.  music today has nothing in comparison to the romantic and touching topics covered by new order.  the substance cd is definately something that will change your life.  buy it take your guy or girl friend somwhere and let the music take you there.  dont just by the cd for the more popular songs by them but rather listen to the beauty of songs like perfect kiss and ceremony where so many complex and intimate thoughts have been shared.  enjoy
0345440757|1.0|I read a review which claimed this was a good alternative to Sears, because one's &quot;personal needs&quot; were taken in to account. Guess what? When one decides to become a parent, one best check his/her &quot;personal needs&quot; at the door. Child care is not static, it is a dynamic proccess. The house will not(should not) remain child centered forever. However, one must take into account brain development. Humans are born with incomplete brain developement, otherwise the mother would not be able to birth the baby. This means, human infants take longer to develop. We consider ourselves superior to animals, yet we would leave our young to fend for him/herself? Yes, we know they are &quot;safe&quot;, however, the baby can not comprehend this.<BR>The child knows when he/she needs to eat. They can only communicate through crying. Why would one ignore this?<BR>Adults do not schedule their feeding (how many snacks did someone you know have today?), so why it is okay to schedule a newborn?<BR>A baby isn't here for our convenience, we are here for theirs. It is the law of the jungle. Respect yourself and your child and skip this one, I wish I had.
6305282927|4.0|One feature not that loudly heralded about Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musicals was that there was always some song in there that might not get it a show tune Oscar, but it had a quirky charm all its own nonetheless. In the case of &quot;Oklahoma&quot; it was the tune &quot;I Cain't Say No&quot;, sung by Zasu Pitts as boy-crazy Ado Annie. The song is exactly as the title suggests--the statement of a lady who doesn't have the sex appeal to facilitate coyness. She likes men and has found that it's best to let us know it. I've dated at least one such woman--don't knock it. And, she suggests, the coy act can sometimes be counterproductive for the foxy ladies as well. Delivered in Pitts' thin voice, the tune never did get designated &quot;our song&quot; by couples, but such songs get you paying attention to the lyrics--every word. I first saw Pitts in her TV role as second-banana to Gale Storm (whatta name--sounds like a name for a stripper!) in &quot;Oh Susannah&quot;, a series about a cruise ship (no, &quot;Love Boat&quot; wasn't the first). Pitts didn't impress me in her role there as Elvira &quot;Nugey&quot; Nugent, but then again, I was a little kid. She's brilliant here as Ado Annie, though. I've heard women with a lot better voices sing &quot;I Cain't Say No&quot; in other productions of this show (including high school), but to me the only true version is found here, sung by a woman with a wierd name and a voice that doesn't exactly blow you away--Zasu Pitts&quot;
6305648522|5.0|I've had an italian class for about 2 years and i've seen this movie like a billion times and everytime i see it, it's like i'm seeing it for the first time again. I love this  movie! And I haven't gotten bored of it yet and it's a shame that they cut half an hour from this masterpiece because the original version shows toto reuniting with his long lost girlfriend. Also since it is a masterpiece they should make a new dvd having this movie remastered and adding the extra half an hour. And yeah it's a great movie to see with your female. Believe me you're going to like this movie, get it.
B000001GRE|5.0|The 7th symphony is, maybe, the most complex in the Mahler's symphonic cycle. Great conductors specialized in Mahler's music (Bernstein, for example) have not succeeded with this score. The first movement tends to be unbalanced in almost all the recordings I have heard, as there are a lot of difficulties concerning tempo and orchestral colour that must be solved in order to achieve a great recording.<BR>Boulez seems to know all these difficulties perfectly and produces, conducting the Cleveland Orchestra, a version of the Mahler's Seventh symphony that is truly a reference, strongly recommended. He seems to know the solution to all the musical problems of the score, and armed with the power of science, he reveals us the nocturnal secret and the hidden treasures of this symphony.
B00005J6UP|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies! It is a true classic, and I have seen it so many times that I have lost count. A bunch of kids go on a treasure hunt, with a bunch of bad guys on their tails. Great action-adventure film for all ages! If you haven't seen it, see it soon. I cannot wait for the DVD release, which contains deleted scenes, and a music video of the Cyndi Lauper song, \\"Goonies R Good Enough\\". It also contains a commentary track featuring a majority of the cast members! Goodie, goodie.
B00003CXSM|1.0|Bridgette Wilson does a convincing job playing a fussy, demanding, selfish bride. But J.Lo can't act--she's poorly cast as an Italian (and has a big caboose, too). Matthew McConaughey is a joke; his twangy accent makes him seem goofier than intellectual.<br />&quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; might appeal to women, but it's not for men. The typical wedding jokes and been-done-before romantic plotlines are worn-out, and this movie does nothing to refresh them. There are many obvious plot holes (a wedding planner with no social life, a doctor who never seem to busy himself with anything not to mention the occasional patient).  The characters are shallow and stretched thin over a plot that is not emotionally engaging.<br />This is a terrible movie. If your wife or girlfriend insists on watching it, demand a night out with the guys.
B00005M4JS|2.0|this movie was not what i expected<BR>the story was not well developped and i don't understand how vianne got all the money and all the cocoa in the middle of a little town in france. to me that sounds quite impossible.<BR>anyways, it's not a horrible movie, but i think the writers should have done some more research.
B0000542DG|1.0|In fact, slit your wrists and try to drown yourself on your own blood before fate &quot;snares you in&quot; and there is &quot;no escape&quot; and &quot;your time has come&quot; and you actually sit down to watch this load of nonsense. Go get Rosemary's Baby instead and remember how horror movies can be low-key AND exciting, instead of just low-key. Pros are an interesting death with a series of hilariously unfortunate &quot;mishaps&quot; and a candyman cameo... Everything else in this movie is a turd falling into my drink... Avoid it...
B00005N83M|5.0|Jennifer Lopez or J.Lo is one of the few performers who can sing, act, and dance. With This Album J.Lo she demonstrates that. The extra track (I'm Real Remix) is a great song, but not the best on the album. Some people might be saying that she can't sing, but for this type of materiel, she doesn't need great vocal cords. <br />1 (Lowest) 10 (Highest)<br />1. Love Don't Cost A Thing- 8. Great Song, But you get sick of hearing it after a while.<br />2. I'm Real- 9. &quot;I'm Real, What You Get Is What You See&quot; Sings J.Lo. Features A Cameo from her ex P.Diddy. He Sings &quot;She's A Bad Bad Bit**&quot;<br />3. Play- 9. A Great Dance Track. &quot;DJ Just Play That Song&quot; The Only Problem is that it could have been longer. This song is just 3min 33seconds. For This type of thing, it needs to be longer to get the feeling.<br />4. Walking on Sunshine- 10. My Favorite track on the album. If this song is ever released it will be a great Club Song.<br />5. Ain't It Funny. 9.5- This will be her next single. She Wrote this song for the movie &quot;The Wedding Planer&quot;. <br />6. Carino- 9. Great Salsa Song. It Brings back J.Lo's Roots. A Live Salsa dand played on it.<br />7. Come Over- 4. This is J.Lo's favorite song on her album, BUT NOT MINE! If you have weak vocals (Like HEr) You shouldn't let people know. That is exactly what she did in this track.<br />8. We Gotta Talk- 8. A Catchy dance song.<br />9. That's Not Me- 10. A Great Hip-Hop Song. Produced By Sean Combs.<br />10. Dance With Me- 10. You will do exactly what this song tells you when you hear it.<br />11. Secretly- 4. SEE COme OVER!<br />16. I'm Real (REMIX)- 10. Better then the original!<br />J.LO HAS SOLD OVER 5 MILLION ALBUMS!
B00003CXHJ|2.0|The acting in this movie was alright at best. The special effects, well, most of them anyway, were passable. During the sinking of the allied sub, you could tell the actors were in a tank on some studio lot. In fact, the tank didn't even look like it was deep enough. Some of the characters were literraly squatting on the bottom of the tank so it would look like they were drowning.<BR>The story alomost made sense. It was, in fact, the British who originally captured Enigma, not the Americans. And the Brits didn't get the machine off a captured sub, either.<BR>The part that really, really, bugged me about the movie was the ending. (I won't give it away, but for those of you who have seen this movie) it seemed rather lazy to me. I wanted the dierctor to spend a few extra bucks and expand on the ending.<BR>This movie is entertaining enough if you don't have anything better to watch.<BR>For sub movies, however, I still prefer The Hunt For Red October and Crimson Tide.
B0000025RI|5.0|Don't believe me? I dare you to buy this record. All though most people see Michael as a freak to make fun of, that doesn't make Thriller any less of a giant. The biggest selling album of all time, he must have done something right!!! And one of only three albums to generate 7 top 10 singles (The other two being Bruce Springsten's Born in the USA and Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation.)<br />Thriller is an energetic record, producing several everlasting hits including Beat It, Thriller, and Billie Jean. It has something for everyone, rock, pop, and funk. Dancey tunes and slow ballads, its all there! <br />Thriller ultimately proves that Michael IS and ALWAYS will be the King of Pop. He leaves shallow boy bands and pop divas of the 90's in the dust.<br />Two words, buy it.
B000002H6C|2.0|I just don't get it. How could Metallica, one of the best metal bands ever, release this as a follow up to Master of Puppets? I absolutely love this band, but the songs on this album really do sound like noise and a lot of yelling. <BR>On a side note-<BR>I have an IQ WAY above 70 (156), and I still love Metallica.<BR>I also happen to like Led Zeppelin, too.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|No need to say much about this engrossing film: it has received enough plaudits from others.  All the cast members give excellent performances, especially Guy Pearce as Leonard, the sufferer of short term memory loss who is investigating his wife's death.<br />The plotting is intricate and stylish with the audience put in Leonard's shoes as the story moves backwards, so most of the time we are as in the dark as he is.  Direction and editing (essential in this reverse storytelling) are very fine.<br />The anamorphic DVD has a superb 2.35:1 transfer, virtually as good as I've seen on disc.  No flecks or damage of any kind, and a complete absence of edge enhancement, artifacting or any other problems.  This picture is vivid and natural, really top notch in fact.<br />Similarly the sound is excellent, with the atmospheric score coming across marvellously.<br />The only snag is the complete absence of additional features, which is sad as this of all films would have benefitted from them.  I reckon a Special Edition could come along eventually.
B0000042H4|5.0|Solti's Ring was not my first, nor do I intend for it to be my last. However, I will be greatly surprised if I do find one greater. I admit that I cannot be completely objective as the only other complete cycle that I have listened to has been James Levine's. But I found Solti's Ring to meet, and beat every expectation that I had. From the first sounds of the Rhein river, to Birgit Nilsson's astounding Immolation scene, I was enraptured. I found the orchestral work magnificent. I think Solti was one of the greatest conductors since WWII, and when he passed away, I felt that something in the music world died with him.<br />The greatest aspect of this recording is the incredible singing. Sung like no other recording I've heard. Live recordings have their merits, and obviously Brunnhilde, and Siegfried, and Wotan may not sing with the same freshness at Beyreuth, but that's what I like about this recording. The singing is crisp and fresh sounding throughout. Who cares if you'll never hear it live the same way. Why not at least hear the &quot;ideal&quot; at home. Nilsson is of course the greatest star on this recording, and she sounds as good as she ever has. Windgassen is in my opinion the greatest Siegfried since Melchior. Neidlinger's Alberich can't be beat. His &quot;Habt acht!&quot; monologue and the curse are absolutely chilling. Likewise, Frick is still my favorite Hunding/Hagen. But despite the &quot;big&quot; stars... All the singing is wonderful! from the Rheinmadens, to the Gibichungs.<br />I have heard complaints about Solti's Die Walkure, but I don't understand them. Some like Karajan's. So do I. I love Vickers and Janowitz as the Siegmund and Sieglinde, but I found King and Crespin filled the roles equally well. And this Walkure is still my favorite. Something should be said for Hans Hotter... I have to agree with Solti when he said that Hotter was quite possibly the greatest Wotan of the century. I would quite agree. The third act scene between Brunnhildeand Wotan is absolutely touching, and Wotan's Farewell hadn't moved me like that since George London sang it.<br />All in all I think this recording is perfect. I have to qualms, set-backs, complaints, or misgivings. There may be other Ring's worth owning, but if I were to have one only, it would have to be this one!
B00003CXRM|1.0|Plain and simple bad, this movie could not keep my attention at all although Clooney is ok but thats it.
B00003CXSP|5.0|First of all, Hannibal, be it the movie or the book, is not a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs. Consequently, it is a different sort of movie altogether.<br />This seems to have confused and disappointed many people.<br />Hannibal is sometimes funny, sometimes violent, sometimes gory and sometimes sad - but it is always stylish, beautifully filmed and well acted.<br />The story does use most of the key moments from the book, but it is not exactly true to the text in all cases. But those wondering &quot;how can they do that in the movie&quot; about some of the scenes from the book will not be disappointed - all the extreme scenes that ask the &quot;how can they?&quot; question have been answered.<br />If you haven't read the book, then just sit back and enjoy - but make sure you have not just eaten - some of the scenes are gruesome by any standard.<br />The second disk of this remarkable two disk set contains over two hours of extra features - and this represents value for money in a big way. One particularly impressive feature was on how they used a combination of makeup, animatronics and computer graphics to execute some of the scenes.

B00000JZI9|5.0|I was watching the TV remake of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN a few weeks ago. For me it had no resemblance to the original 1960 film but instead looked like it was made from a blueprint from 1985's SILVERADO right down to the acting, costumes and production design. When I saw SILVERADO in the summer of 1985 I was not entirely pleased. It was directed, co-scripted and produced by Lawrence Kasdan. Kasdan had scripted RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and beautifully captured and updated the adventure film genre from the 1940s. However, Kasdan did not direct RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. I feel that the look and experience of RAIDERS is really more the results of Spielberg's direction and visual approach to the script, not to mention the perfect casting of Ford as Indiana Jones. Unlike Spielberg's film, SILVERADO under Kasdan's direction looks more like a product of the 80s the decade in which it was directed. SILVERADO is not a bad film and in fact it is rather a unique one. It seems to have not influenced or spawned any future cinematic Westerns in the traditional sense of any great consequence. In fact UNFORGIVEN and DANCES WITH WOLVES which followed were two Westerns that went on to win the Oscars for Best Picture of their Year. These are both complete inversions of SILVERADO being more psychological and sociological studies of the Westward movement and experience. SILVERADO is an updated homage to the myth of the American West. SILVERADO is a very entertaining film and it did help rejuvenate interest in the Western but not in Kasdan's vision. The heroes Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover and Kevin Costner were very good. Rosanna Arquette, John Cleese, Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt and Jeff Fahey were also good. The one performance that was critically overlooked was Jeff Goldblum as Slick. One normally does not associate Goldblum as a bad guy with the exception of his role as a sleazy street hood in the original DEATH WISH. There is no sleaze here. Goldblum in SILVERADO is definitely slick and a very smooth villain. One of the film's greatest and enduring assets was the score composed by Bruce Broughton. Broughton's score was a larger than life rousing tribute to the American Western. It's brilliant and very moving. When you look at Jerry Gatlin's stunts and Carol Littleton's and Mia Goldman's editing of John Bailey's cinematography combined with Broughton's score you are witnessing some great stand-up-and-cheer moments. Today I enjoy SILVERADO much better than when I first saw it. Like life in general, you never know where the good old days are until you think back on them.ick and a very smooth villain.

B000001Y2U|5.0|This is my second attempt at reviewing this album, as Amazon censored my first review. I must give this disc 5 stars, not only because it is Mansons VERY best release, but because there are scores of religious whackos who gave it bad reviews without ever having heard it. <br />   The songs here are much more intense than Manson's first albums. They also have a superior production thanks to studio wizard Trent Reznor. But the content is the most impressive thing here. &quot;Man That You Fear&quot; is one of Manson's most intelligent songs to date. &quot;Irresponsible Hate Anthem&quot; is hard and fast enough to please your hardcore metal fans. All said, there isn't a bad song on the album. If you like the songs you heard on the radio; &quot;Beautiful People,&quot; and &quot;Tourniquet&quot; then chances are you will really like the whole thing. The other songs are good enough to be singles, but most would require too much editing. <br />   If you are easily offended, then PLEASE leave this album on the shelf. Mr. Manson is fully aware of his right to free speech and exercises that right as much as possible. <br />   If you are not offended easily, and enjoy heavy music then by all means go get this one, even if you don't like Manson's other material. This is by far the best.
0451191153|5.0|Ayn Rand has very fascinatingly captured the lust for power in her nove. It is by the very virtue of lust that power exists among the like minded who think, and are in a materialist sense, capable of influencing and dominating the people who have no easy means of proving their potential, except their voice. Men have lusted for power since ages. It is a natural emotions, and deceptive enough. It is somehow inherent in any individual who cannot tolerate the co-existance of another superior being. Men have been mentors, there is something called conditioning of the mind, in which people are made to belive in certain theories in life. The earlier it happens more ruthless a person becomes. It is easy to affect ordinary, regular men and women who can be driven like flocks. Amongst them who are easily bored in life of secondary positions in life for themselves, but who wish for othes to remain in the backseat, must become supreme by cutting down any possibolity of opportunity of thought and action among the other. And lesser lot is the only word that the others must be confined to<BR>Fountainhead is about Howard Roark, a firm believer in himself. He is willing to defy the society when it comes to compromising in work. He is a truly gigted Architect whos only commitment in life is , his dedication to originality and honest efforts, and his constant battle against odds.
B000009QPK|4.0|I don't like most live albums. More often than not, live albums are poorly produced, have screaming fans overdubbed onto the music (KISS Alive I, II, and III) and the musicianship isn't as good as it is in the studio. Fortunately, that is NOT the case with this one. <br />   Slayer has always been known to be a good live band. This album proves it. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman prove that they are both very good guitar players. Dave Lombardo never missed a beat. The only thing that lacked at all is that Tom can't hit the high notes as well anymore, but I'll live. <br />   I'm impressed with the selections on this album. The majority are from their two best albums; Show No Mercy, and Reign In Blood. They started the show with &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; and ran right into &quot;The Antichrist.&quot; I wish they still did this. That is the perfect way to start a Slayer concert. <br />   Another thing that I'd like to point out is that while they were touring in support of the Seasons In The Abyss album, they didn't play all of the new songs, and forget all the old stuff. They played several songs off Seasons, and still played all of their old classics. <BR> <BR>   This is one hella good live album, not to mention a good Slayer album. This is like having a Slayer &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. If you are new to Slayer, this would be an intelligent choice for a first album.

B00005A46T|2.0|I have a real love/hate relationship with Slipknot. They, especially in the past year or so, seem to take themselves far too seriously, with all the stupid satanic imagery, the outspoken comments about other bands (warranted or not), and the fascination with the costume and mask schtick, which they don't seem to realize has grown ultra thin. However they remain some of the most intese individuals I've ever seen, and have proven at least in the past that they can write a mean song. Now, I can imagine where they're coming from on this record: a band who, three years ago, was scraping by in Des Moines, gigging with horrible bands in horrible venues, and building their fanbase up one by one. Now they are seen (read: mistaken) as gods of preaching the pain and angst that their fans have harbored since childhood, so naturally they have to come up with a record that has to destroy the last one in intensity, and true, they have delivered just that. However, all of Iowa literally drips with an almost poser-ish effort that reduces Slipknot to overblown aggro commoners who are more interested in proving to the audience that they're badder than bad than crafting the well written, well presented tracks that laced their previous release, such as Sic and Purity. The tracks, especially as the album goes on, become predictable and, worst of all, tired ripoffs of the band's own style. So if attitude and intesity is what you're looking for, this is the place. The problem I have is that I can't tell how genuine those attributes are with Slipknot anymore.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Actually, I saw the movie on a plane.  I laughed so hard, I had tears flowing down my cheeks.  The flight attendants were amused at my reaction to this movie.  The movie makes the DVD a must get!!!
0783225792|5.0|Just because it isn't the original doesn't mean it isn't the best. Casino is the best mafia film I've ever seen. Pesci's portrayal of psychopath Nicki Santoro is brilliant. Maybe it is an expansion of his previous role in Goodfellas but so what. A previous reviewer complained that these characters lack the inner conflicts that Scorseces earlier movies had. These are different characters and he's telling a different story. Psychopaths don't have moral conflicts and most of these mobsters are psychopaths. What is shown is the epic rise and fall of power in the underworld of Vegas. And, it is shown quite brilliantly. You aren't supposed to feel empathy for these characters. Do you feel empathy for John Gotti? Do you feel empathy for every murderer, psychopath, gambler, and gangster who walks the streets? This is a movie that shows a very ugly slice of life: the mafia. It is not a pretty scene. I especially liked the fact that it didn't try to show some twisted value in it because there really is none. As far as showing mobsters doing what they do, this movie is top quality.<br />As a side note, I'm not making any judgement on the mafia or its members either.  There are many people who grew up in this mold that is so brilliantly portrayed in this film, and who am I to judge them.  The actual growing up is shown well in the TV series the Soprano's when they show Tony as a kid.  These people don't live in a pleasant world and they may not do pleasant things but they usually reap what they sow and many of them don't have a choice.  Attempts to analyze or judge these poeple should be left to those who know them well and grew up with them.  I'm told that Mr. Scorsece lived and witnessed alot of what his films portray, so rather than judge and pretend I was the one who was there, I'd rather enjoy.  He is a genius for turning his experience into art.
0684833395|5.0|I was told to read Catch-22 as a summer reding assignment, and was not looking foward to it at all, but his may be one of the best books I have ever read! It is thought provoking without being too tiring, it is funny without being stupid, and nothing in it is too far fetched to be true. I reccomend this book highly!!
B00000J2SS|5.0|Having listened to the studio version of &quot;Difficult To Cure&quot; and then seeing the live version on the long-deleted &quot;Live Between The Eyes&quot; VHS, I was intrigued by the possibility of the version which exists on this release. It is worth the price just for that track alone. Rainbow with an orchestra.....Incredible. But while this is an exceptionally high high-point, it is not the only one. To finally hear &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot; live with Graham Bonnet (sadly the only live track from this short-lived incarnation of the band) was something of a revelation, although I still prefer the studio version. But this compilation covers almost every line-up of the band, presumably ignoring the line-up which recorded &quot;Onstage&quot;, for obvious reasons (see that album and the &quot;Live In Europe/Live In Germany&quot; sets. The only sticking point for this was the inclusion of a couple of non-album b-sides, which had already appeared on the &quot;Best Of Rainbow&quot; album in the UK in the early '80s. A couple of other live tracks might have been better. How about more from that Monsters Of Rock show which produced &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot;. If you're expecting a 2CD live album, forget it. This is a compilation, and should be treated as such. But maybe the time has come to release some of the older live material in the full glory of the concert recording format. &quot;Live Between The Eyes&quot; was a good show, but on CD you would certainly lose the full impact of the guitar-smashing - although it does SOUND really good!!! Come on Polygram, raid those archives!!
B0000026J6|2.0|I was introduced to Cohan via Austin City Limits rebroadcast of 1988 program. The show was fantastic and I wanted an album. This album has many of the songs featured on the program. On the program, the singers and instrumentalists had solos. The album lacks these brilliant interludes. What we are left with is just Mr. Cohan's voice--&quot;monotonal, gravel-on-velvet delivery&quot; which wears thin after a song or two.
630463949X|5.0|This is a great DVD for any Fleetwood Mac fan.  Even if you have the CD of the same name, you still need this DVD.  The CD doesn't contain all the music that the video does.  For me, the most notable example of this is Gold Dust Woman...one of my favorite Fleetwood songs of all time.  The band plays great here, despite their years--so much so, that I've grown to like some of the concert versions of the songs (The Chain, Landslide, etc.) better than the actual studio version.  Well worth the price.
0515125024|5.0|Here Child steps out of his guy-daydream stage in Killing Floor into Die Trying, a top-notch sequel better than the original.  No longer in the first person, Child offers up three (if not more) parallel plotlines that collide here there everywhere so quickly that almost no one could predict it.  Though the final fifty pages are rushed and a little tedious to read, much of it is inventive and a fun read.  Bottom line: Don't be fooled by Killing Floor's weak points.  Die Trying more than makes up for them.
6305910103|4.0|In my opion, this is still the best of the Star Trek series (movies and TV included).  It certainly is the most exciting.  It is great to watch William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban try to over-act each other while quoting Moby Dick.  The scenes of The Enterprise duking it out with The Reliant have never been topped.  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 Stars is that this DVD--although it looks and sounds great--doesn't have any extras on it.  Perhaps they are holding that version off for a few years.  It seems a common tactic so if you are holding out for &quot;The Wrath of Kahn--The Ultimate Version&quot;, hold onto your money.
B000003S5H|5.0|Kind of rare analog, melodic, jazzy groove. Downtempo and just darn good.<BR>This has become one of my alltime favorite albums and bands.  It's rare to find such a good album and band. I'm a hard grader compared to most amazon folks and these 5 stars are really worth it.
B00003CXAR|5.0|What can one say of the movie Jaws?  It is an icon--as much as the Statue of Liberty or The Empire State Building.  I've noticed some people dump on the special effects as &quot;pre-CGI&quot;.  This movie is the argument AGAINST CGI.  Don't believe me?  Watch &quot;The Deep Blue Sea.&quot;<br />As for the DVD itself, a lot of the material was all ready included on the 20th Anniversary VHS--notably, the Spielberg interviews.  However, that was just VHS.  This also contains many of the deleted scenes which (although clearly left out for a reason) are still quite enjoyable to watch.  This DVD sounds like no other broadcast version I've heard; compare this whale-song to the one on VHS.  Also, this is a completely different movie seen in widescreen format.  If you're a Jaws fan, you have to own this DVD.
0553213105|5.0|I read this book when I was 12 and because I had watched the Wishbone show and did not believe that the main character could be a dog. The words were a bit difficult but I read it and was really surprised. It starts out a bit slow, but after the middle, it became really interesting and after the book, I felt really good. I actually read the end a couple times again. The characters are really charming, especially Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I guess you could say it was the ultimate miscommunication. It is an adult fairy tale, is what I can describe it as.
079073639X|5.0|This movie is for those that like a challenge while viewing, and it helps to have a working knowledge of basic physics, biology, or to just be able to understand and appreciate laws/theories of science.  The acting is great, the suttle allusion made between Hoffman and Stone's characters lightened up the dialogue, Samuel Jackson is one of my favorite actors and definitely didn't dissappoint me with this one.  This movie will bore you if you don't like engaging in conversations (or even just thinking alone) about scientific &quot;what if's?&quot; or just don't appreciate thinking about the psychological dillemmas and dynamics that occur between humans that become confronted with a near, present, and unpredictable (insurmisable) danger.  But I say this, you don't have to be an MIT graduate to appreciate this Sci-Fi movie (my best friend went to MIT, I went to Brown, so maybe that's why I liked it), but if you're an intellectual, this movie provides you with something to see and think about.
B00004RF9I|4.0|When all is said and done, I'd have to say my favorite film of all time is &quot;Network,&quot; and I loved the VHS version of this film released in the early 1990s. However, in this packaging there are a couple of things that I really have to nitpick over. First of all, the MGM lion that roars at the beginning of this film, is not the one from the 1976 release.   For whatever reason, the MGM logo of the present is used.  (With a gold loop of film and the dubbed roar that's been used since the 1980's.)  This takes nothing away from the film's content, but for a true film buff this is problematic since there is no reason that springs to mind as to why the logo would need to be changed.   <BR>   Also, I've noticed since the early 1990s with their Widescreen VHS releases, that MGM wide-screen releases don't seem to be the real McCoy.  The film is matted to fit the screen with the double-bars, but it still seems like there are portions of the actual film space that have been cropped here.  I could be wrong, but I've noticed this in everyting from &quot;It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; to &quot;The Manchurian Candidate.&quot;  Don't call it Widescreen or Letterbox, if it's not the full picture.<BR>   And then finally, the trivia game that comes with this is extremely easy.  Even if you've only seen this film once, which character do you suppose is going to be quoted the most?  <BR>    I love &quot;Network&quot; but just wish I could love this DVD as much as I loved the VHS release from the 90s.
B000002UAO|5.0|&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is one of the greatest rock albums ever made and was a turning point in the Beatles' career. I find it surprising that there were no #1 singles on this record. Of the 14 tracks on &quot;Rubber Soul,&quot; only &quot;Girl&quot; and a Ringo tune called &quot;What Goes On&quot; fail to measure up to the Beatles' reputation for masterful music production. &quot;Drive My Car,&quot; &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; and &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; are as quality in production as any Beatles song ever performed. &quot;Norweigian Wood&quot; and &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; reveal a message that goes beyond &quot;She loves you, yeah, yeah.&quot; In this record, I hear not only 60's rock and roll, but also Chicago, Genesis, and every other band that was to later form.
B000059XUI|5.0|Alas, it's been 20 years since this film hit the big screen and here it is in its widescreen glory, plus a trailer, to help recapture the fun of the summer of 1981.   The liberties this film takes with the Superman saga are forgivable, because as storytelling goes, this is one of the best comic adaptations ever.  Zod and the Kryptonians come across as real terrors, and the humor of Lex Luthor saying &quot;Thank God,&quot; when Superman arrives after losing his powers is priceless.  Richard Donner probably would have added extra spark to this film had he been allowed to finish directing this, but there are few things you can nitpick with in terms of this film.
B0000028MA|5.0|released in 1992 on epic records, this album came out right around the beginning explosion of seattle.  in 1992 seattle was to rock what bethlehem is to christianity and this album encased in a movie and a soundtrack a good part of the idealogy of the movement.  This album holds many great bands.  We kick off with Alice in Chains with thier song WOULD? a dark contemplative song from 1992's DIRT.  Pearl Jam contibute two with BREATH(think ten era PJ) and STATE OF LOVE &amp; TRUST(a favorite of theirs to play live) Chris Cornell makes a solo appearance with SEASONS(a slower more thoughful piece)   The Lovemongers (otherwise known as Ann &amp; Nancy Wilson from heart) cover Led Zepp's BATTLE OF EVERMORE  quite brilliantly.  Mother Love Bone (queen meets Pearl Jam style rock) contribute their classic CHLOE DANCER/CROWN OF THORNS .  SoundGarden show up with the rocking BIRTH RITUAL (also in the movie!!)  Mudhoney contribute with the ironic song OVERBLOWN while the great but lesser known seattle band Screaming Trees hit with the catchy NEARLY LOST YOU.  Jimi (the classic seattle star)  makes a ghostly appearance with MAY THIS BE LOVE.  The only two bands here not from Seattle are Paul Westerberg who penned the very catchy DYSLEXIC HEART (which runs through the movie) and WAITING FOR SOMEBODY.  <BR>   The final song on this album is to me the chciago born SMASHHING PUMPKINS best song ever.  It is really ony a three minute rock song but it clocks in at 8:17 because of the five minutes of wonderful feedback at the end.  Only Billy Corgan (the greates 90's guitarist in my opinion) could craft such noise so brilliantly AND meldocially.  the textures and tones of the music he creates continually blow me away and of course he is backed by the master drummer Jimmy Chamberlain who keeps the song rock solid and yet still manages to throw in his usual genius fills.  never too much not too little.  this song is the perfect rock song and worth the price of admission.  <BR>   Singles delivers from begginning to end and you cannot go wrong with this album
B000000993|4.0|With the extrication of this year's &quot;Lateralus,&quot; I reckon a good reflection on the albums of Tool is in order. In comparison with the band's 2 other full-length LP's, this one is strong. Extremely strong in fact, placing itself right in the middle of the other two in terms of composition, concept, originality, and... well, greatness overall. By far more direct than the muddy, numbing repetition of &quot;Aenima,&quot; it is also more creative. This is what started Alt Metal, that would eventually be the upbringing of bands like Staind, Linkin Park, and Limp Bizkit. Whether you like these bands or not is irrelevant, other than to bring up that TOOL, in fact, planted those alt metal seeds that led to other hybrids of metal. &quot;Sober&quot; showed the world that alternative music COULD get more depressing and darker than &quot;Come as you Are&quot; and &quot;Jeremy.&quot; &quot;Undertow&quot; is also more talent-demanding and has more of a genuine feel than &quot;Aenima.&quot; Rather than the poppish hooks of &quot;Aenima,&quot; this one has musical movements and shifts. The crazy time signatures and off-beat guitar/drum combos would latter influence the 6/8's in Maynard's A Perfect Circle and the stellar &quot;Lateralus&quot; where Tool would bravely forge into the future of alt metal and music in general. The incredible shifts in &quot;Undertow&quot; would be reflected in the opus-like tracks on &quot;Lateralus,&quot; as well, so not just anyone can make the music on this album. It's quite demanding.<br />Aside from the talent required to make it and the album's concept, the individual songs are just as astounding. The afore-mentioned &quot;Sober&quot; was the first single and the song, really, that started the whole alt metal scene. Other greats here are &quot;4 degrees,&quot; the driving &quot;Swamp Song,&quot; and one of my all-time favorite tracks &quot;Prison Sex.&quot; Being one of the genre's first attempts back in 1993, you would expect it to soundnew and fresh then, but those qualities still remain for me almost ten years later. Simply amazing. A disturbing vision of innocence lost and the possible dysfunctional relationship of Maynard Keenan and his step-father, but the lyrics contain only hints. And that's what makes it art. It's challenging, esoteric, and requires thought and effort to decifer, in contrast to today's pop standard of &quot;what you see is what you get.&quot; Perhaps that is why this album stays so crisp so many years later. &quot;Intolerance,&quot; the opener, has many of the same qualities, focusing more on the population than an isolated incident. &quot;Bottom&quot; and &quot;Undertow&quot; are excellent tracks as well and deserve recognition. As a whole the album is infinitely important, considering the false imitators, the musically influenced, and the hoards of fans that followed. Amazing music.
B00003CXSP|3.0|The long awaited sequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" not only manages not to live up to the first film but it doesn't even live up to the book which although good was very flawed, namely in the ending.<br />Ridley Scott has taken the continuing saga of Dr. Hannibal Lector and has unfortunately made it rather slick and over the top. What \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" had that made it great Scott has taken away for this film in an attempt to make it his own but has fuddled it up in the process.<br />This film catches up with Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling some ten years after their last encounter and since then the good doctor has been quite busy. He now lives in Florence as a respected historian and is getting on with things. The film revolves around Starling's and a former victim named Mason Verger's attempts to catch him.<br />Let's look at the flaws of this film. For starters although Julianne Moore is a great actress she is no Jodie Foster and fails to provide the strength yet insecure vulnerability needed for the character to work that Jodie Foster did. I know the character is supposed to be older and stronger but this makes us less interested in the character and what happens to her. Starling still had the vulnerability needed to make us care about her in the book of \\"Hannibal\\" but she fails to have it here. Moore and the character are rather boring to watch and I never really cared about Starling because of it. Second, the film relies far too much on shock gore to keep its audience interested. The disembowelment in Italy and the feast at the end shock you during viewing but do not have the lasting chill that the tension from \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" provides. The violence is very strong in this film and for those who are easily disgusted: be warned. Third, Anthony Hopkins could never have lived up to his performance in \\"Silence\\" and does not. Lector is too slick, too playful and comes off as almost cartoonish at points. A lot of this comes from the fact that the film focuses on him and also because he is not behind bars. Free, walking around, talking to people Hannibal is not nearly as frightening as locked up, don't-touch-the-glass Hannibal.<br />In comparison to the book I would say that the strong parts of the book are weak in the film and that the weak parts of the book are stronger in the film. The best parts of the book are when Lector is in Florence and Merger's men are after him along with the Italian cop. This part is exciting and suspenseful and well crafted but in the movie they seem rushed and unimportant. I would say that Scott rushed everything especially the part when Lector returns to America. It was so rushed it was hard to tell what was going on. One minute he is in Italy and the next he is being chased around a mall in the U.S.A. Although not great, the end in the movie is an improvement over the end in the book. It is still to strange and not at all true to the characters or the story or just the plain feel of the film.<br />A disappointment but still interesting to watch and by no means awful. Just flawed.<br />Thanxs...m focuses on him and also because he is not behind bars.

B00005B36H|5.0|After reviewing the other Tool albums, resulting for a much needed clarity of thought on Tool's talent and the records that came as a result, I thought I'd give the time to review my favorite from this diverse, original band.<BR>Already firm in my respect for Tool's music, from the start of their creation of alt-metal during the &quot;Undertow&quot; seesions, and the not as adventurous, but still undeniably good &quot;Aenima,&quot; I secretly expected big things from &quot;Lateralus.&quot; Not liking to be let down, I tried to hold my hopes and simply take the record for what it was worth. But, as in times past, Tool has shown me something new, involved, and inspiring. A musical level reached by few. And the fact that they were able to accomplish the set of songs on &quot;Lateralus&quot; after only two full length LP's is impressive. When compared to the two said albums, &quot;Lateralus&quot; comes out on top; head and shoulders above anything they have attempted in the past. &quot;Undertow&quot; was a fabulous album with very few weaknesses. Incredible, considering they were rookies in alternative and pioneers in a new genre (Alt Metal) at the same time; this showed what the band was capable of. &quot;Aenima&quot; marked a new position for the band; pop metal, which entailed everything it sounded like, including becoming more accessable. The songs were weaker than &quot;Undertow's&quot; and the styles were less genuine and generally monotonous, though several tracks stood out as some of Tool's finest work. &quot;Lateralus&quot; marks an even more daring, complicated stance for the band, having gotten their feet wet with that characteristic back in 1993. The hooks had developed into shifts and movements, and the pop had mutated into full-fledged progressive rock, notched onto their already unique style. Some critics and many &quot;fans&quot; of the band site repetition and drawn out movements as the records downfall, but for listeners like myself, it's a score, a soundtrack to surrealism. Perhaps the way metal would sound if it were conducted in a symphonic style. This album, more than any other takes you further into the unique world of Tool.<BR>Much like the album as a whole, the songs are complex, layered, and downright exhausting. It requires something from the listener, hinting at the herculian task of writing it. &quot;The Grudge&quot; kicks off the set and further persuades the listeners to think for themselves and warns of the disastor of not being complete, &quot;otherwise it all comes down.&quot; &quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Mantra&quot; marks the noise and experimentation between tracks that Tool fans have become accustomed to, though said tracks are far more musical and foreshadowing than their past predicessors. &quot;The Patient,&quot; another LONG musical track intrigues the listener with haunting lyrics and eerie harmonies by Maynard. &quot;Schism&quot; is more along the lines of what fans were expecting, but it contains the new Tool element as well. Maynard has obviously progressed in his melody-writing, with up to four audible harmony levels in parts of &quot;Schism&quot; and the fantastic &quot;Reflection.&quot; Tracks 7,8, and 9 (&quot;Parabola,&quot; &quot;Ticks and Leeches,&quot; and &quot;Lateralis,&quot; respectively) create the albums centerpiece; &quot;Parabola&quot; supplying what is expected, &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; forging a new angst-Tool style, flexing the band's musical muscle, and &quot;Lateralis,&quot; perhaps the sets finest song. The listener is again chilled during &quot;Disposition,&quot; while MJK whisper's under an echoing guitar, &quot;Watch the weather change.&quot; It is the first of the album's triad, which contains the stellar aforementioned &quot;Reflection.&quot; Overall, this is something that has never been attempted on this scale, and if it has, it won't be as memorable as this. Tool's masterpiece.
B00005A46T|4.0|The new S.K. is an all around example of what the new revolution of N'sync and Backstreet boys destroyers are supposed to sound like.Put away your red New York Yankee hats and get ready for all out intensity.If you are tired with the everyday sound of the cliche groups that get  destroyed in the mosh pits of the world then this disk is your cup of tea.Not the kind of disk for people who want to ride the \\"trend\\" I think the only people who will truely grasp the meaning of this disk is the ones who can relate.An all around feel good disk that makes you want to destroy everything in your path while at the same time sayin have a nice day.Do yourself and society a favor get this disk now maggot.Track #6 makes me want to rip spines out while i enjoy the cookie crunch of a twix candy bar.Enjoy.

I love to escape into this simple story and take a look at life as it could/should have been. Everyone in the movie is terrific and I believe all of us should &quot;look for the sunny side of life&quot; whenever and where ever we can find it.

B00004XONN|1.0|people, it's okay to admit when a band you like puts out a ... record. Pablo Honey and The Bends had some brilliant songwriting. Great melodies. This sounds like the Demo mode of a Casio keyboard with some retarded guy on downers providing vocals. Use your money to buy lottery tickets. That is a better investment.

0876855575|4.0|I've read a few books of his poetry books and now know where Mr. Bukowski is coming from.  In his poems, he's not just acting as a silly, drunk, sorry gambler for the sake of art - he IS all of these BUT he can write!  He can tell a story, and Ham on Rye is a very, very good story.  It's sad and happy and funny and so real all at the same time.  For those growing up who think the whole world is against them and think their existence is so difficult, I recommend this book to them - and have already done so.  This is one that belongs in the classrooms for its frankness and honesty.  Sometimes, lots of times, life really does stink.  This book however doesn't!
B00000099Y|2.0|Metalheads practically blow their shorts when the word &quot;Tool&quot; is uttered, and I'm here to voice my opinion.  Yes, they're musically talented.  Yes, they're deep.  Does that make them good?  No.  Tool is so caught up in their weird-hidden-genetic-what-you-hear-isn't-what-it-means complex that they let it supercede the music itself.  There's very little emotion to the msuic; it's as if they spent so much time writing it and perfecting the performance that when they record, they go through the numbers and head home.  Maynard has this messiah complex that rivals Bono, (he's from U2, for you metalheads that think this is one of rock's all-time masterpieces)and though he has a degree of vocal range, he either oversings or cuts his vocals short when he could carry them a little more.  Many people are drawn to Tool for the modernist edge to their music.  I don't mind having to think about my music,  In fact, I prefer to have a little brain excercise.  But Tool takes it way too far.  How can you like this band when you don't know what the moogerfoogin fudge-monkey a song means?  It could be about Bill Hicks!  No-wait...that's what they WANT us to think!  It's about genetics!  Yeah!  That's it!  I hink I'll go read a textbook so I can know what this song means!  Yeah!  Cuz' Maynard wants me to think about the world around me!  Yeah!  Whatever Maynard says!      <BR>     <BR>Though I'm not much of a Tool fan, I have respect for their musical skill.  But their fans are idiots.  Sorry guys, but Captain Beefheart or Frank Zappa are much better alternatives to guys who shout obscenies when they're not sure how to express their angst.  They were true musical innovators, not Hollywood freaks who have their pretentious heads shoved up where the sun don't shine.  Shoot- the Ramones are a great deal smarter than Tool.  But that's the way metalheads are.  If it's not loud, heavy, and rife with guitar virtuosos, they won't listen to it.  And because Tool is all of that with Pink Floyd mindsets, they think they're God.<br />     This is gonna make you fume for days, but Nirvana was heavier, and smarter.  And not without a sense of humor.
6305171769|4.0|Nothing can come close to outdoing John Carpenter's Halloween, and H20 doesn't come close. Still, it is one hell of a \\"Halloween\\" film. This is the one that everyone has been waiting for. Michael Myers discovers sister Laurie Strode has faked her death, changed her name, and is now the Head Mistress of a private school in Southern California. Her 17 year old son John also lives with her there. Michael decides for a holiday family reunion. Jamie Lee Curtis is phenomenal. No longer is she young, innocent Laurie Strode. She is now a much more stronger person who wants to end her demons once and for all. Some fans weren't as pleased with this colder, harder Laurie. I was for it all the way. I mean, it's been 20 years. She went thru a lot and has lived with it. People change. Things will change them. She couldn't be the same Laurie we all know and love. I thought it was a great character dynamic. Jamie Lee blows her previous two performances to hell with this one, as well as pretty much every other scream queen performance. The remaining cast:Adam Arkin, Michelle Williams, LL Cool J, Janet Leigh, really have nothing to do. That's a horrible shame. Halloween gets an A list cast but doesn't take advantage of it. Arkin is exceptionally likeable and watchable. He should've been given a lot more to do. The film could've done without all the \\"fake scares\\", but it is still a suspenseful film. Nurse Marion being back was a nice touch, as was the use of a Loomis photo and the old \\"Mister Sandman\\" song from Halloween II. The ending was very strong and effective. Michael reaching for Laurie's hand was, dare I say it?, touching. It was a truly superb and extraordinary end for the movie and the series. There has never been a Laurie/Michael moment like that before in the series. It was a very strong scene that will no doubt be a pivotal moment in the series. Many people whined because it ignored previous storylines. That was a good thing. The previous storyline was so hampered down byinane junk that it was the problem the series started to really stink. Ignoring it was a good thing to do. It turned the series into something else. Something it doesn't, and shouldn't, need to be. I do wish, however, that the events of Part 4 were looked back on. I don't like the ignoring of the 'Jamie' character. It would of been nice to of mentioned her. This is the first film without Dr. Loomis. It is a sad thing to think about. He WAS the star of these movies. He made them. His presence was definitley missed. How nice it would of been for him and Laurie to be together in this. Chris Durand is an adequate Michael. The mask was pretty good, and he had the walk down. He was a little too thin and puney tho. The score, by John Ottman, is nice. It sounds good, but he mixes with the theme and eases the tension off of it. It sounded good, but was not right. All in all, they tried hard to return Michael to his old self. They succeeded. There wasn't much blood or any kind of gore(like the original), and the body count was down from previous installments. It was time they turned Michael back into 'Michael' instead of turning him into a ridiculous, over the top slasher like Jason. Why so many fans hated this is beyond me. All I know is that this is the first sequel since the original that was made like it was done with love and respect for the series and it's fans. The series will, and has, go on. What H20 tried to do will of been for nothing at all. That's a shame. They did such a good job. Let's hope future sequels, if there are any, will try as hard as the makers of this one to make a Halloween film that looks and feels like a Halloween movie, and that it is done with the same kind of love and admiration as this one. Nothing is going to be as good as the first one. People going in to see a new sequel should not even begin to think that. H20 is a great treat for fans. The real fans.
0783223668|5.0|I typically hate Westerns.  I usually find them incredibly boring.  I've seen the old ones (Shane) and the newer ones (Unforgiven).  I even managed to sit through The Outlaw Josey Wales because of all the hype I'd heard about it since I was a kid.  Boring.<br />High Plains Drifter is different; it's more than just a Western.  I happened to channel surf to the opening credits when it was on TV years ago.  I started watching it only half-heartedly, but to my surprise, I was quickly hooked.  It's a very dark film with a somewhat confusing story at first, but that's what draws you in. In the end, it all comes together.  Justice is served, both to the villians and the townspeople.<br />If you see one Western, this is it.
6300214044|5.0|To say that this production of David Lynch and Freddie Francis is my favorite film of all time is an understatement. I have seen it so many times over the years that I have honestly lost count. At one point I was so completely fascinated with it, I was going to it two or three times a week while it was still in its first run in the theatres. After all these years and all these viewings, I believe I can finally put my finger on just what exactly it is about this film that does it for me: It is what I would now call an \\"atmospheric\\" masterpiece. This film really transports me to another time and place, draws me into another world, like a time capsule. I leave the theatre (or in this case now, after a home video viewing) feeling I've visited another dimension - which is what I want a really great film to do for me.<br /> My introduction to John Hurt - here completely unrecognizable under makeup based on actual casts of the Elephant Man's head and body - came primarily through the \\"I Claudius\\" television series in the 1970's, and is truly one of the most underappreciated actors of the 20'th century in my opinion. This performance of his as the historical Joseph Merrick, a Victorian Englishman suffering from severe neurofibromatosis, is truly a tour de force.  Merrick, rescued from a life of degradation as a circus sideshow freak, is taken into the London Hospital by the altruistic doctor Frederick Treves, another factually based historical figure, upon whose own written accounts the story is partially grounded.  Initially wishing to help Merrick escape his life of hopeless servitude to wandering carnival proprietor/\\"owner\\" Bytes (perfectly portrayed by the great Freddie Jones), Treves soon faces the moral dilemma of whether he's resposible for having Merrick stared at all over again - albeit in better surroundings. This is an important film in my view, for its portrayal of human compassion. Although that having been said, the story also struggles with this issue of morality at the same time, in this comparison between Treves, Bytes and an unscrupulous nightwatchman at the hospital who all seem to want to use Merrick for their own ends.<br /> The beauty of Bernard Pomerance's play \\"The Elephant Man\\", was that the portrayal of Merrick was done without makeup - a part that would bring out the best in a qualified actor.  Here the roles are reversed, with John Hurt's features completely obscured by those of Merrick.  An astounding performance.  Another of this age's truly great actors - Anthony Hopkins - portrays Dr. Treves.  Top-notch supporting roles are turned in by Anne Bancroft as Dame Madge Kendall, John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller - whom some may recognize as Leslie Howard's personal project in the precursor to My Fair Lady, the 1939 adaptation of G.B. Shaw's \\"Pygmalion.\\"<br /> Whatever the difficulties morally speaking for Dr. Treves, Merrick is given the chance to live out his last days with the dignity his actually refined mind and spirit deserve.  There are many wonderfully touching scenes -  the recitation of the 23'rd Psalm, the reading of Shakespeare, the visit of Merrick to Dr. Treves' home, Merrick asking the doctor if he can be cured, and the visit to the pantomime.  Freddie Francis' black and white photography is the real selling point in creating this atmospheric masterpiece that I mentioned before. This just would not work in color. One of the greatest shots in the whole film is a long shot of a steam locomotive inching across the screen from right to left, its plume of thick white steam slicing across the palette of varying shades of grey, that looked absolutely stunning on the big screen.  And of course, the music by John Morris.  Minimalist, yet so much is conveyed.  In short, treat yourself to this film as a fine example of a story of compassion, human dignity upheld, or as simply an example of masterful film making, wonderful acting by a slate of the best of British theatre.

6305537542|5.0|What can you say?. Halloween is the granddaddy of horror/slasher films. This film started it all. You have to hand it to John Carpenter and Debra Hill. They took a simple premise that has been done before and made it new and scary. Very, very, very scary. Everything about the movie, the musical score, the acting, the look of October,is gripping and classic. No other film has been as frightening or memorable as this. Donald Pleasence is a master. His Loomis character is, may I say it, the anchor of the films. Not Michael Myers. His performance is so graceful in this that it's a shame his career and Loomis character had to end with the travesty that is Halloween 6. Jamie Lee Curtis is great. She comes across as a real teenager doing a very normal thing that all teens do. Babysit. This is the scariest movie i've ever seen. The original &quot;Nightmare On Elm Street&quot;comes in second. Halloween is so scary because it's real. Turn on the news and this is more of what you'd see. This can happen to anybody. The sequels, except for H2O, are another story. The film focused on suspense and terror. That's what sets it apart. It doesn't cheapen it by senseless, gratuitous gore. Any hack can write that. Not that a little gore is bad. To this day, this movie still scares me. That says something. The sequels, good or bad, are still quite fun and entertaining. Michael Myers still has his scariness in all of them. That doesn't happen often. I can't stress enough the fact that Halloween is a masterpiece of cinematic terror. The only thing that resembles Halloween is the original &quot;Scream&quot;. May Halloween live on to terrify trick or treaters for decades to come.
B00004XOWM|2.0|I bought this album the day it came out...Everyone has to admit that \\"Rollin\\" is catchy as heck, and it is a fun listen even though like all radio hits, it tends to get old. Really though, if you like heavy music \\"Full Nelson\\" is not a bad song at all. \\"Boiler\\" and \\"The One\\" are both good emotion driven songs....this CD is not all bad, and if you can get a bargin for it somehow buy it for those three songs.
B00003CXRM|5.0|My 5 stars nothwithstanding, this movie has several flaws -- Clooney's worked-beyond-the-point-of-death pomade fetish being only the most obvious and grating. What it also has, though, is several scenes that are nothing less than astonishing. At the top of my personal list (I'm sure you have or will have your own) is &quot;Down in the River to Pray.&quot; I have not listened to the CD &quot;soundtrack&quot; of this movie, but, reading the reviews, I get the idea that Alison Krauss pretty much took over the song there. If true, that's a shame, but whether it is or not, the visual element is so strong -- and so essential to the subsequent progress of the movie -- that no audio-only rendering could possibly duplicate the experience of the DVD. In this scene, the faithful &quot;materialize&quot; out of the woods -- and out of your rear speakers if you have a surround system -- to involve you personally. In their white robes (which costumes are repeated later in somewhat less harmonious circumstances -- a &quot;coincidence&quot; that I'm sure was NOT lost on the Coens), the congregation represent the ingenuous best in depression-era southern culture.<BR>Hmmm, I guess I better quit this review now, before I talk myself out of the 5 stars. ;)
6303182577|5.0|Without question this was a landmark movie. Some of the greatest acts in rock and roll were able to perform in this movie. The movie going fan was able to see the Who,Joe Cocker,Janis Joplin,Jimi Hendrix,Sly and the Family Stone, Richie Havens, John Sebastian and the Loving Spoonful as well as many other up and coming stars in the world of music. The music in the movie was very good. The on the scene footage was also well shot. You were able to see Woodstock from every perspective<BR>in this movie. That this video is till available 32 years later<BR>is a testament to this event. Buy this and watch it. It is a collector's item.
0792846303|4.0|The Fog is an insanely creepy film that will make you feel differently towards bad weather. A sinister fog that invades a small, fishing town brings the ghosts of dead sailors looking for gold. They will get anybody out of the way to get it too!. This movie is horribly overlooked. That's a crime. This is one of John Carpenter's best work, which, by the way, hasn't been stellar recently. The movie has a eerie, creepy look and feel to it that I haven't noticed in a horror film besides &quot;Halloween&quot;. The killer sailors themselves, are very scary. In fact, most of the film is. Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't get enough scare time in this film than &quot;Halloween&quot;, which is a shame. Adrienne Barbeau is more of the heroine in this film. It's also a hoot to see an ecclectic cast that also includes John Houseman, Hal Holbrook, Janet Leigh, and &quot;Halloween&quot; veteran Nancy Loomis. This is one spooky classic that's destined to leave you creeped out. Don't watch it on cloudy days with the lights off!. The Fog is coming...
0345350499|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I would say this is one of Marion Zimmer Bradley's best book! She brings you right to the time period in what every fantasy lover wants. You will lose track of you own time. You will fall in love with Morgaine and her family. The magic with sweep you off your feet and leave you thirsty for more. Margaine learns as well as teaches you all about her life and others as a priestess. This is about as close to the Arthurian series as can get to truth. I totally recommend it!
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles (White Album) is without a doubt the greatest Beatles album of them all, here is a quick runthrough the songs...<br />1) Back in the U.S.S.R.:  a great rocker, with a rather funny &quot;Beach Boys&quot; parody thrown in.<br />2) Dear Prudence:  One of the best on the album, one of John's best songs period.<br />3) Glass Onion:  Very delightful song, with a great sound.<br />4) Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da:  Pitiful attempt at reggae, but still a descent song.<br />5) Wild Honey Pie:  This song is more of a joke song, even though it's not very good, it's still not bad.<br />6) Bungalow Bill:  Very catchy song, a real sing along (expecially the chorus)<br />7) While My Guitar Gently Weeps:  Great George song, great guitar from Eric Clapton.<br />8) Happiness is a Warm Gun:  Very good song, one of the best on the album.<br />9) Martha My Dear:  They say Paul wrote this song about his sheep dog, if he did, I think he was a little &quot;too&quot; close to her, still a very good song.<br />10) I'm So Tired:  Good Song, if you're depressed, it will make you even more so<br />11) Blackbird:  Great acoustic song by Paul.<br />12) Piggies:  Very catchy song by George.<br />13) Rocky Raccoon:  Very delightful parody of those old &quot;Story&quot; Country western songs.<br />14) Don't Pass Me By:  Not a great song, but then again it was written by Ringo.<br />15) Why Don't we do it in the Road:  Funny song the first time you listen to it, but it gets a bit boring after a while.<br />16) I Will:  Very good love song, it will get you thinking about that &quot;special someone&quot;.<br />17)  Julia:  Who said John couldn't write a good ballad?  This is probably John's greatest ballad, and one of the best songs on the album.<br />18)  Birthday:  This is a great song to play at a birthday party.<br />19)  Yer Blues:  Descent blues song, but at all costs don't listen to this song while depressed.<br />20)  Mother Nature's Son:  This is my least favorite song on the album, I've given it a chance, but now, whenever I listen to this album I skip this song.<br />21) Everbody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey:  Probably the longest title of any beatles song, but also one of the catchiest songs on the album.<br />22) Sexy Sadie:  One of the best songs on the album, this song is severly underrated.  This is one of the best Beatles songs ever.<br />23) Helter Skelter:  The hardest rocking Beatles song ever, very good song.<br />24) Long, Long, Long:  In my opinion, THE MOST UNDERRATED SONG OF ALL TIME!!  This is without a doubt George Harrison's greatest song!  Just listen to the lyrics, they really speak to you, well at least they do to me.  The voice volume is a little low, but once you get used to that, you'll find, this is the BEST song on the album!<br />25) Revolution 1:  Very delightful, slower, version of Revolver.<br />26) Honey Pie:  Good song, it gets your toes tapping.<br />27) Savoy Truffle:  very catchy tune.<br />28) Cry Baby Cry:  I love the chorus, but I feel they could have done much better on this song, if John would have just taken some time to write lyrics that went with the chorus lyrics!<br />29) Revolution 9:  This isn't a song, and many people hate it, but in my opinion the sound arrangements are very good.<br />30) Good Night:  This is a good song to play to your kids as they go to sleep.<br />The Greatest tracks, in my opinion, are (in no particular order):<br />Dear Prudence, Glass Onion, Bungalow Bill, Happiness is a Warm Gun, I'm So Tired, I Will, Julia, Everbody's got something..., Sexy Sadie, Long, Long, Long (the best), Savoy Truffle...but all of them are great (Except Mother Nature's Son), those are just my pick of the litter.

B00005B6ML|5.0|This is a made for television movie (almost a mini-series, in fact, since the film clocks in at just under 5 and one-half hours) that I remember watching, spellbound, for three evenings.  I am delighted it is once again on video.<br />QB VII (the title refers to Queen's Bench Courtroom number 7 in London) is an adaptation from a novel by Leon Uris (\\"Exodus\\").  The story centers on two men: Sir Adam Kelno (Anthony Hopkins) and Abraham Cady (Ben Gazzara), each of whom provide compelling performances.<br />Kelno (Hopkins) is a doctor who is a Polish nationalist and anti-Communist.  Following World War 2, the Polish Communist government brings action in England to have Kelno deported back to Poland as a war criminal for atrocities he is alleged to have committed as a prisoner doctor in the Jadwiga concentration camp.  He is acquited, and signs on with the British Colonial Service as a medical doctor in Kuwait.  For his efforts in treating nomadic tribesmen there, he is Knighted by the Crown and establishes a medical practice serving poor Londoners in the Elephant and Castle district.<br />Abraham Cady (Gazzara) is an American who volunteers with the British Royal Air Force (RAF), and is decorated after being shot down while on a mission.  Although his father is an Orthodox Jew, Cady has no use for Judaism and is, in fact, a self-described Anti-Semitic Jew.  He goes on to become an Oscar winning screenwriter in Hollywood, and is unfaithful to his British (and non-Jewish) wife, played capably by Juliet Mills (of \\"Nanny and the Professor\\" fame).  <br />Only after his father dies in Israel, and Cady visits Yad Vashem, the Israeli museum honoring victims of the Holocaust, does he have an awakening of his own Jewishness.  He writes a massive novel, \\"The Holocaust,\\" in which he mentions that Dr. Adam Kelno performed castrations on Jewish prisoners of the Jadwiga concentration camp in collaboration with the Nazis.  <br />The book, \\"The Holocaust\\" becomes an international best-seller and Kelno sues Cady for libel.  Their Courtroom confrontation is at the heart of the film, and the film must be seen which is why I will not divulge the ending in this review.<br />Hopkins and Gazzara are perfect playing two very flawed men.  The talented and beautiful Lee Remick, who died much too soon, is excellent in her all-too-limited role.  British actor Julian Glover is very good in his role as Polish intelligence agent Zaminski, who comes to Cady's aid.  (The scenes that purport to be Warsaw, Poland were actually shot in Belgium).<br />The one time I had to suspend disbelief was in connection with Cady's father, ostensibly an Orthodox Jew, being so accepting of his son's marrying a non-Jew.  But that is somewhat nit-picky, and doesn't detract from this wonderful, dramatic, work.  Very highly recommended!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Almost Famous is a great movie... Very emotional and funny.

But &quot;Twister&quot; has something that most films don't have: characters that are real characters!<br />While the main characters do a great job in this film, it is the supporting characters, playing grad students, that will enchant you - especially if you have been in grad school yourself. This movie let me experience again that great time in my life where enthusiasm for what I was doing was my whole life and nothing else mattered. That's a great time in anyone's life and &quot;Twister's&quot; supporting characters will allow you to see it again, either in yourself or some of the friends you had.<br />And the floating cow is neat, too...
0385474547|4.0|Achebe's &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is simply a good book.  It is not spectacular, nor are its ideas earth-shattering; yet after reading it I felt quite satisfied.  The story follows the life of Okwonkwo, an Ibo tribeman.  A reknowned warrior in his youth, Okwonkwo strives to work his way out from the shadow of his listless father.  Far from a model hero, Okwonkwo is tragically flawed with a quick temper and a rigid mindset.  Okwonko serves as a metaphor for his tribe as a whole.  Both are in some ways beautiful, some awful, and some tragic - and with the coming of the white man, both are doomed.<br />Achebe does an excellent job of portraying the clash of two cultures.  He skillfully avoids politicizing the events and demonizing one side or the other.  Both the tribesmen and the white missionaries primarily consist of honest people.  The conflict between the groups arises not out of evil, but out of ignorance.  The near perfect ending to the story drives this point home with a subtle blow that will leave you thinking for quite some time.<br />While not a perfect book - it was too short to develop the characters to my satisfaction, the language was simple and lacked grace, and the names were often confusing - Achebe's work is well worth the investment of a few hours.
B00003CXB2|5.0|The line I always remembered best, from David Lean's &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, is said neither by nor to the eponymous Lawrence played by Peter O'Toole. No, it's Anthony Quinn to Anthony Quayle, only two of the remarkable cast assembled for this desert epic tale. Who else is in this film? Besides O'Toole, Quinn, and Quayle, try Omar Sharif, Jose Ferrer, Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guinness, and Arthur Kennedy. How can you miss with a cast like that? Dead on perfect, every actor.<br />The audience is left by and large to decide for themselves whether Lawrence was a mystic, a fanatic, a rogue, a meglomaniac, or anything else that comes to mind. We see his start, from an obscure British army officer merely delivering a message to Prince Faisal to a commander of an arab army sweeping the Turkish Empire back as World War I rages in the Middle East as well. Here's a movie that really is a feast for the eyes, as nearly every few minutes there's an incredible shot of desert caravans or looting armies or a triumphant Lawrence ego-tripping out as he parades atop a derailed train.  &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; made the careers of both O'Toole and Sharif, and deservedly so. If you haven't yet seen this granddaddy of all epics, hoist yourself onto a camel and hunt it down.
B00005614N|4.0|Why only four stars ? Because,for a few more bucks, you can buy the complete sessions,a two cd-set including a complete cd of rehearsals; and these rehearsals are gems; so,if you're able to buy the 2 cd set, don't hesitate. BUt if you can't, this one will amaze you; Duke's piano playing has rarely been captured as on this day,and Louis is superlative.Each tune is a masterpiece,Louis' voice is outstanding all through the record,and Duke's piano is great : listen to &quot;I'm just a lucky so and so&quot; for example.I used to listen to this record for 25 years, as far as I can remember,but certainly more,because my parents owned it and played it frequently; I was a child,and it was a great shock to me,just as Louis' &quot;good book&quot; and &quot;hot five&quot; recordings.Personnaly, I'll treasure this reunion forever.
0790733226|5.0|It may be understandable that &quot;Contact&quot; is well seen in Carl's adopted town of Ithaca, NY, where his wife, Ann, still lives. Ann has said that Carl would be proud and happy with this film.<br />For me &quot;Contact&quot; was able to nicely walk the tightrope between fantasy and fact. A good many of the characters you see are based on real people that Carl knew in the SETI community. While we can't know what will happen when - and I do say when - we discover other life in the universe, &quot;Contact&quot; gives us a good account of  the nobility that the human race will show when it happens (embodied largely in Ellie), the ignomy (embodied largely for me in the portrayal of the Government and David Drumlin), and the  misplaced but sincere concern we'll all feel (embodied in Palmer Joss).<br />In the end &quot;Contact&quot; is actually not about the aliens. It's not about the search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. It's not about the science or the technology. Carl Sagan, as he did so many times, wrote a story about US - the human race, the human condition as we will be when we take that final, humbling step on the road Copernicus put us on so many centuries ago when he ripped the Earth from the center of the universe and put it as one of so many planets in the Solar System.<br />As such, &quot;Contact&quot; doesn't have to be seen as a Science Fiction film if you don't want to see it as such. You'll love this film if you've ever felt passionate about anything in your life. You'll love this film if you've ever had that passion challenged.<br />Heck, you don't even have to know what a radio telescope is! See this film. Who knows, we might see it in real life sometime.
B000031XBQ|5.0|I first heard this CD in college... it was filtering through the vents from the dorm room above mine! I went upstairs and knocked on the door... A handsome Spanish exchange student suddenly answered. &quot;I am Alberto, and si, this is Abba.&quot; Intruiged (by everything), I stayed long enough to dub a copy onto cassette. Then his beautiful Spanish girlfriend showed up and I went back to my dorm room with only Abba to console me.<BR>Though Alberto, college, and my worn-out cassette are only memories now, I have my CD to make it last forever. Abba is just as fab in Spanish and this CD is quite a conversation piece. You can always tell the true fans -- put this on and they go crazy wanting to know where they can buy it. If you love Abba, this is a great twist on the favorites. I highly recommend it!<BR>(Handsome Spaniard not included.)
0792839692|3.0|Visually, the film isn't much to look at.  It's painfully obvious from the main titles that you're looking at models, plus the sequence goes really slow in my book.<br />Story wise, I thought the spectacle of people going into the arena to watch those people on LastDay &quot;renew&quot;, was something akin to Roman times where lions feasted on those thrown to them.<br />The &quot;lifeclock&quot; in the hands was a neat idea, too bad the producers had to end life at 30, otherwise we could have seen more interesting combos.<br />Jenny Agutter's costume, if you could call it that, was a bit racy for a PG rating.  And what is this &quot;circuit&quot; that was mentioned?  Apparently the era's entertainment.<br />I think more time should have been devoted to background items such as this, along with other aspects of life in 2274.  Another example is HOW do children get to Cathedrel?  Do they 'escape' from Nursery, or are they put there?<br />I thought that the &quot;New You&quot; shop was put there strictly for the plot.  I mean, if you're only going to live until you're 30, you won't have TIME to get tired of the way you look, as you'll be too immeresed in other things to much notice.
B00004U30D|5.0|This film is awesome!  So beautiful from it's cinimatography to it's message.  You will never look at a paper bag or your life the same way again...
0790733226|3.0|This is an excellent story. Jodie Foster is compelling as the child that never stopped believing in her dreams, in spite of everything. Oscar-worthy performance by her and her costar (Matthew M.)<br />Very watchable movie that can handle multiple viewings.<br />However, this dvd edition's \\"extras\\" come up VERY short. Audio commentaries sound canned & non-interactive. They would have been better off adding alternate language tracks.<br />There is NO theatrical trailer on this edition, which is a shame because Contact had a very good one. <br />Buy this dvd because you like the movie (which is good), but dont expect to be thrilled with so-called collector's edition bonuses. I'd rather buy a \\"no-frills\\" dvd than buy this one expecting something extra.
1878424114|4.0|I have read almost all of Deepak Chopra's books. From some I gained much, from some I gained little, but from this one I gained the most. It's filled with 7 common-sense principles for attaining your goals and being happy. All the principles presented are profound yet simple - some more practical than others. All are concepts most of us already believe in but don't know exactly how to express. This book clears it up. If you're going to buy just one Deepak Chopra book, let this be the one. I also highly recommend &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life&quot; by Taro Gold which is a collection of hundreds of thoughts from Eastern wisdom. &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life&quot; and &quot;The Seven Spiritual Laws&quot; are my two favorite books of wisdom of all time. Excellent!
0060392886|5.0|I stumbled upon this book recently and started reading it 3 days ago, I haven't been able to put it down since. <br />For those that didn't grow up listening to the raw distortion of Motley Crue's music, this book will horrify you...to those that did, it will also horrify you! The book is very well put together and provides the most revealing incite into one of rocks most pioneering outfits. Despite listening to these guys as a teenager and admiring the many pics of them in mags such as Kerrang! and Sounds, I had no idea that four human beings could be quite so depraved, stupid and helpless. It's gripping stuff....god help them!!!!!!
6305327084|5.0|Among my favorite movies of all time, you almost wish you were in the town hanging with these brilliant characters.  Preformances by Timothy Hutton, Michael Rappaport (unreal), and Rosie O'Donnel, among their best, while the rest of the star studded cast shines very brightly in their roles.  A movie that was not afraid to tackle subjects that may not be politicly correct (Hutton's interest in a 13 year old girl) will ensure that this movie is a landmark release for years to come.  'Beautiful Girls' already has quite a cult following with audiences aged 18 - 35.  I can't express enough how much this movie should be apprieciated.

B00004Z459|5.0|Great cd, I would encourage even the most conservative music listeners to get this one. I really wasnt that interested in heavy music at all until I listened to &quot;crawling&quot; on the radio. After that, I was on a mission to get the CD for linkin park and so I stopped at nothing to get it.<br />Like most people, I bought this CD because I wanted the song &quot;crawling&quot;... all the rest of the songs I didnt even bother with. DONT DO THIS! Most of the songs are pretty good actually, some of them are excellent! IN fact, id have to say, &quot;crawling&quot; is probably my least favorite song on the CD now. I personally like the songs...<br />2. One Step Closer (listen to this one if you just had a bad day at work! :)<BR>4. Points Of Authority<BR>6. Runaway<BR>8. In the End (excellent song)<BR>9. A place for my head (cool beginning, so-so for the rest)<BR>11. Cure for the Itch (strange beginning, but the song has a nice and mellow beat)<br />Make your own opinions and and get this album. Believe me, no matter what kind of music you like, jazz to punk to country, GET THIS CD!
B00005JIZA|5.0|Conneticut-born, Atlanta-based singer/songwriter John Mayer's major label debut, Room For Squares, showcases a refreshingly honest, genuinely passionate performer. In an industry dominated by flavors-of-the-week teen sensations, 23-year-old Mayer's versatile, emotive voice and unabashedly personal songwriting is a welcome change of pace. Naturally, the folky/jazz atmosphere and sleek but not slick production will draw comparisons to everyone from Dave Matthews to Jakon Dylan to Ben Folds to Sting, but closer inspection reveals an artist all his own. It's Mayer's unflinchingly honest lyrics that set him apart from near rivals. &quot;Well, these days I wish I was 6 again. Oh make me a red cape, I wanna be Superman&quot;, Mayer sings on the tune &quot;83&quot;, an inovocation to his childhood containing mostly autobiographical elements. On &quot;Why Georgia&quot;, Mayer tackles self-doubt over gorgeous acoustic guitar strumming. Mayer's talent as a 6-string guitarist is also on display throughout much of this disc, most notably on the funky guitar lines of &quot;Neon&quot;, a tune previously heard on MTV's Real World. There's the ode to foreplay (&quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland&quot;), battle cry for individuality (&quot;No Such Thing&quot;), and the vunerable call for love (&quot;Love Song For No One&quot;), each sung in Mayer's distinct vocal style and unique, irrepeatable phrasing. Verdict : get John Mayer now ; chances are you'll be paying a lot more to hear him later.
0767830555|5.0|With out a doubt, this is director Martin Scorsese's best movie.  Robert De Niro plays taxi driver Travis Bickle, a down on his luck Vietnam vet who takes a job as a taxi driver to make ends meet.  What makes this movie amazing is how true to life it is.  All that Travis Bickle wants to do is be somebody.  He wants to be known for something.  The bad thing is he is willing to do anything to get his recognition.  Many people have connected with this movie because Travis Bickle's life seems to mirror theirs.  No one takes him seriously and nobody seems to care about him.  He is just another face in the crowd.  Many people have felt like him, maybe not to the point of murder, but they have related to him.  Scorsese directs this film like no other and De Niro plays Bickle brilliantly.  This movie has impressive camera work and one of the best shootouts ever.  Watch it!
B00005AXEL|4.0|In the 7 years since Stevie Nicks' last solo album, 1994's spotty Street Angel, rock's gypsy-queen has seen both her image and her music elevated from near parody to the epitome of modern-day cool. She reunited with Fleetwood Mac and scored a Number One album, was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame, and made high-profile friends with the likes of Courtney Love and Destiny's Child. So it should suprise few that on her latest release, Trouble In Shangri-La, Nicks, at 53, sounds more confident than she has in nearly two decades. Trouble In Shangri-La finds Nicks clean and sober and in good company. Featuring high profile guest appearances from Dixie Chick Natalie Maines, Macy Gray, Sarah McLachlan, and close friend Sheryl Crow (who produced 5 of the albums 13 tracks), Trouble In Shangri-La offers classic Nicks in a suprisingly focus package. While some might argue the &quot;too many cooks...&quot; theory, the disc's guests never detract from Nicks and one gets the impression through that this is most definately a &quot;Nicks album&quot;. The most impressive improvement of the album can be heard in Nicks' rich, expressive voice. On the electro-acoustic &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, listeners are treated to a brief but striking falsetto from Nicks, backed by rush of earthy harmonies from Sheryl Crow. Seemingly renewed, having given up the Behind the Music excesses that brought her voice to a gravelly mumble throughout much of the early 90s, Stevie hits high notes she hasn't attempted in years. The songwriting of Trouble In Shangri-La is a mixture of new songs and holdovers from Nicks' pre-solo, Fleetwood Mac days, yet none of the tracks feel out of place. The mock-Babylonian chant on the title track suits the OJ Simpson inspired subject matter of &quot;fame&quot; while the sophisticated mandolin on &quot;Candlebright&quot; adds charm. &quot;Fall From Grace&quot;, while no &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;, is a punchy, up-tempo rocker and &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot;, aNicks/Maines duet, finds the singer dipping into twang territory with pitch perfect skill. Even the sweet, string-laden, VH1-ready &quot;Everyday&quot; evokes emotion. None of the songs sound alike, which is precisely what makes this album Nicks' most varied yet. While perhaps not Stevie Nicks' best album, Trouble In Shangri-La is still definately worth the price of admission.
B00000GAIW|3.0|Jethro Tull is certainly a very creative band.  And Aqualung has some captivating moments.  Locomotive Breath with its classical intro and driving guitar riffs is a definite highlight.  Mother Goose is a pleasant acoustic ditty.  And the first recording of Wind Up is certainly a hidden gem.  I love the shifts in volume and tone on this one.  Hymn 43, Up To Me, and My God have some captivating touches.<br />However, the excessive religious theme is a bit much over the course of an album.  Whereas I like the basic riff in Aqualung, the lyrics just irritate me.  &quot;Snot running down his nose&quot;...yeeech!  Some of the lyrics in Cross Eyed Mary are not actually appealing either.  The interview does not present this record well and is way too long.  Why in the wrold is it even on here.  The extra tracks add very little and the other acoustic ditties lack a decent melody in spite of being basically pleasant on the ear.<br />Tull fans will probably lambaste me but this CD is not as reverred as others may think it is.  Ian Anderson is a good vocalist and flute player and Martin Barre and the the keyboard player(John Evans??) make some strong contributions.  However, the casual fan of these guys is best off picking up a compilation.
0790743221|5.0|Katharine Hepburn stars as a socialite about to marry self made man John Howard. Her ex-husband, Cary Grant, brings a couple of reporters, James Stewart and Ruth Hussey, to her wedding to cover it for a tabloid. She hates any invasion of her privacy, but begins to get over it when she discovers Stewart's talent for writing. As the film progresses, it becomes apparent that a lot of the characters are in love with each other, and by the end, you're not quite sure who will be getting married. The characters also learn that perfecton is a lot to ask of someone, and it's really the flaws that we all have that define who we are and make us so interesting.  This film has become a classic of comedy for a number of reasons. The dialogue and screenplay are first-rate, with a tremendous amount of wit, sophistication, and humanity thrown in, as characters reveal themselves by both words and sometimes by just the look on their faces. This is greatly aided by a dream cast of actors. Hepburn has fun playing the tough, demanding socialite in the beginning, but then goes deeper into the insecurity of the woman underneath with a lot of honesty. Grant is at his usual classy best, delivering one liners with ease, while also demonstrating his true feelings underneath it all. But it's the reporters who come off the best. Stewart is witty, cynical, and surprisingly romantic in a performance that is not what you would usually expect from him, and Hussey is dryly funny and wise as his patient photographer more interested in him than the story. Young Virginia Weidler, as Hepburn's little sister, is terrific and very natural. George Cukor expertly weaves it all together, and topped with the usual M-G-M production values, it's a class effort all the way.
B00004RF9B|5.0|This movie rates as one of the best sci-fi movies of all time, easily in the top 10. Certainly it is my favorite pre 1970's sci-fi movie. The cinematography was truly memorable and story line captivating. It has everything, horror, action, great scenes and plot, and even a beautiful maiden. I wish they had made a sequel so I could learn more about those amazing Krell. Robie the robot was introduced by this movie and many other firsts of special effects. I can never get enough of this great classic.
B00004XOWM|4.0|I love Limp Bizkit, i have all their albums. This one was good not as great as &quot;Significant other&quot; but just fine has some pretty cool songs like Hot Dog,My Way,My Generation,Rollin and their hilarious intros and outrous. I thought it was good and should be added to any Limp Bizkit fans collection, even though not their best it's still quite good, don't listen to others rate yourself.
B000050XEI|4.0|It may sound odd but that was one of my objections to this recording.  It's beautiful, don't get me wrong, and I've loved all of her albums, but it just seemed like she went too mainstream on this one.  It sounds too &quot;pop&quot;, really.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This album is just a TOTAL triumph.  And how about all these reviews? Maiden inspires passion, because their music is powered by passion. So I'll add my 5 stars.<BR>Amazing thing about Maiden is, back in the day, they put out FIVE albums in a row that are just CLASSICS. They have stood the test of time, and they stand up to an unbelievable amount of repeat listens.<BR>And: I keep changing my mind about which of those is the best, depending on which one I listened to last.<BR>And Brave New World is in the same class.<BR>The one definite thing that stands out is that the sound engineering is a significant advance over the earlier disks. There's more richness here, more distinct musical voices punching through the mix. Let's hear it for modern recording technology. The mixers of this one have a genius consistent with the genius of Maiden's songwriting and harmonies.<BR>I find the best way to listen to this kind of music is with headphones. You get that great buzz in your head. It's like waves of sound crashing through your brain, into your soul.<BR>Trivia: did you realize Bruce has sung the phrase &quot;Brave New World&quot; in 2 earlier songs? (one on a solo album). Yes, you're right, I am too obsessed with this band.<BR>To anyone reading these reviews who ISN't already a Maiden fan and wondering what all the fuss is about -- they just have an amazing chemistry and sense of harmony. They are magical.<BR>So will there be another album? There HAS to be, guys, you're just hitting your stride!
B000002LTU|4.0|A few weeks ago while trying to get a BBQ together for 350 that was running behind I suddenly heard that familiar horn playing on the Chef's stereo but it wasn't the usual Miles Davis I was into. After inquiring I realized it was Doo Bop and after listening to a few cuts felt my tension melt away. A few days ago I picked up the album myself and loved it even though I'm mostly a fan of Miles stuff from the 50's and 60's. It's a shame Miles passed away while making this because I feel he was really on to something espeacilly considering that he was planning on working with Prince soon. If anyone is considering looking for something different than what Miles usually had put out, pick up this album today.
158234082X|5.0|in the restaurant biz. I laughed aloud many times. I remember the tattoos, the ripped clothes, the bandanas. I remember the oppressive heat, the frantic rushes, the crush of waitrons hoping to get a few of the (too few) popovers in the middle of a mad rush... I can hear A. yelling diminutives that only a sailor or a cookie could love.... after time as a dishie, time as a runner, and time as yes, (gasp) a waitron (no Doogie Howser here!), it's good to know that my experience rings true to the Chez OohLaLas of New York. And here's to the folks who still live this life, making dinner out so good for the rest of us. Makes me want to become a regular at a really good restaurant near me. :-) Not a book for the faint of heart, or for the folks who need to believe that their chefs are as figuratively scrubbed and polished as their surgeons. Bourdain describes people who are serving, creating, and dealing with life as it comes. These folks, for all of their colorful foibles, CAN take the heat in the kitchen. Good to see that through all the stress, and all of the hassles, that Bourdain is a stand up guy. I can see why his peers have responded so well. Makes me think fondly of the cookies at JPH, and reminds me that perhaps my life is calmer and more comfortable than it was those summers, perhaps it's duller, too. Maybe those folks are really LIVING a lot more than the rest of us are, too. It's a small consolation to know that I still can speak the lingo.
B00002616T|5.0|I am real Keith Jarrett addict. How many people listen to six hours of improvised music...and love it all the way (KJ: the Sun Bear Concerts) - so when i read the extremely positive reviews of the album, i just bought it. The CD has just arrived in Holland, and when I saw it I thought: oops, the album is almost 30 years old...it must sound horrible. Well: it doesn't. It sounds as if it was recorded yesterday. Fresh, vibrant, clear - with some great music on it. Music that shows a different Keith Jarrett. The music reminds me of the early work of Klaus Doldingers Passport - using these strong melodic saxophone themes. It's maybe the 'European influence'. Anyway. Worthwile!
B000050HTO|5.0|A common problem with artists as productive and versitile as Bob Dylan, is that new fans will often have a hard time getting introduced to thier work as a whole. For years the only way to Dylan's most well known songs was to buy one of his multiple disc collections. But now for the first time, new fans or those wanting to get introduced to Dylan's work have a great starting point; The Essential Bob Dylan is the perfect compilation of some of Dylan's most well known, well loved, and important songs. Like the Beatles One, there's no way you can go wrong with a collection of 30 bonified classic songs. This is a definite recommandation for starters.
0060931736|3.0|The good points:  an interesting story, which is at basic about a woman with a powerful and magnetic personality who used young girls to meet her own unmet personal needs - a manipulator extraordinaire.  At first she is presented as a sort of hero and receives the girls' worship, but as the book progresses it becomes clear how unpleasant of a person she really is, despite the positive effects she has on some of the girls.  Also positive in this book is that its plot definitely moves in a solid forward direction and it has a good smattering of flesh-and-blood characters and enough low-level perversity (mild examples of adults seducing teenage girls, and description about girls' developing chests, etc.) to keep the reader more-or-less expectant, or perhaps terrified, of what might just happen next...<br />The weak points:<br />1) much of the writing itself was quite dull, even repetitive, and so often the grammar - in the PROSE! - was horrendous, with the worst offenders being run-on sentences that cause you to knock your head against the wall.<br />2) much of the information provided about the characters was repeated over and over again, almost like the author was doing it purposefully and for some sort of quaint humorous effect, which at first it was, but soon became simply annoying and insulting to the reader.  I began to wonder if what the book really lacked was a strong editor.<br />3) Tons of extraneous detail about subjects that added nothing to the plot's core, subjects such as religion, politics, and who-knows-what-else.  Once I recognized the detritus for what it was I started skimming, to no ill effects on my enjoyment of the book<br />4) The book was set up with the expectation of coming to a powerful climax, but the author basically gave away the ending throughout the book, so that by the end there came no sense of fulfillment...
B00000064G|5.0|I, like pretty much anyone who has gotten into Nick Drake's music in the past year or two, found out about him from the Volkswagen Cabrio commercial. I fell in love with the song, and pretty soon I was on ... trying to find more and more of his songs. Pretty soon, I just bought the album and gave the entire thing a listen.<br />     \\"Pink Moon\\", the title track, is definitely one of the best songs on the album, but it is not the best. \\"Things Behind the Sun\\" is, in my opinion, the best track on the album; every time I hear it, I get chills down my spine, especially the last two lines: \\"And the movement in your brain, sends you out into the rain.\\" Every song on this album is a gem, from start to finish. My only problem is that it's only about 28 minutes long... I wish he could've put more songs on it.<br />     But that is only a very minor problem, and I only wish Nick Drake were still alive today to see that his dream really did come true. Nevertheless, at least I can still enjoy his music from all four albums and treasure them forever.
0679720200|4.0|Camus gave birth to a character whose apathy seems to be the<BR>fruit of pragmatism and a desire for simplicity. Meursault is <BR>cursed with hyper-sensitiviy to the people and elements around <BR>him. He becomes exasperated when others say things that he has no<BR>concern about. Whatever palpable enthusiam he once had has been<BR>replaced by the need to sate physical demands and momentary lapses of curiosity. His unrestrained stolid demeanor infuriates<BR>his employer who perceives it as a lack of ambition. It hurts his<BR>girlfriend's feelings when she ask if he loves her.

6302517052|2.0|I'm sorry but I can't look at a film that displays people being chased by tumble weeds and call it scary. These little guys are way to small to call this a horror film. It was more funny then scary. I was astonished when I found out that they made two more, hehe. Sacrilege!
B000059HAI|5.0|A unique collaboration between American and Japanese filmmakers, &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot; remains the definitive Hollywood portrayal of the tragic events of December 7, 1941. Perhaps the greatest compliment ever paid to this film was provided by none other than Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay, the &quot;masterminds&quot; behind the disastrous &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, who stated that &quot;Tora&quot; played too much like a documentary. Well, how about that? No meandering love story, no Hallmark script, just cold, hard facts. &quot;Tora&quot; places us smack dab in the middle of a lethal chess game played by politicians in Washington and Tokyo throughout the Fall of '41. The political stalemates and blunders which inevitably lead to war are the meat and potatoes of &quot;Tora&quot;. The climax is, of course, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor which is masterfully and accurately re-created. Vintage airplanes and actual ships are seemlessly juxtaposed with miniature models. The results are a spectacular cinematic experience which still holds up by today's standards. (Digital effects didn't exist when &quot;Tora&quot; was released in 1970.) Several big names-- Joseph Cotten, Martin Balsam and E.G. Marshall -- assume starring roles, yet wisely let the story be the &quot;star&quot; of the film. Credit the filmmakers for steering the focus toward the &quot;event&quot; without getting sidetracked in typical Hollywood fashion. To objectively portray the events of Pearl Harbor through the eyes of both sides, while keeping finger-pointing to a minimum, was no small task. In turn, the ability of the viewer to experience the preparation and strategy of both sides makes &quot;Tora&quot; truly unique. This is an important film which treats a monumentally tragic event with the respect and accuracy it rightfully deserves. Essential cinema -- not to be missed.
0380789019|4.0|Daydream a world where everything is as it seems and nothing bears safety. You've just imagined 'Neverwhere', the haunting, volatile Gaea that exists in the belly of London.<br />In Gaiman's first novel, London is separated into two cities, the popular, familiar London Above and the dark, forboding London Below.<br />Richard Mayhew is the man stuck in the middle, twisted reality and fantasy slipping between his fingers. Before he can assume his life above, he must assume it below. <br />The novel introduces us to multitudes of space and characters that are still fresh in mind after the last page is finished.
B00005LMBK|4.0|I was at a friends house and he had this album...I liked it so much I went out and bought it the next day. The music is really good, but also it's so different and weird that you just wanna buy it. I've never heard anything like it. I would have given it 5, but some of the songs aren't great, the others rock.
B000000132|5.0|This is, without any doubt, the best album Renaissance ever did. Besides the classics &quot;Running Hard,&quot; &quot;Mother Russia&quot;, and &quot;Black Flame,&quot; the other three cuts are so perfect its amazing they did not receive the attention the other songs did. &quot;Things I Don't Understand&quot; is the most underrated song this band ever did. &quot;Cold is Being&quot;--ALRIGHT!! Let's end it all right now!
B0000009TJ|5.0|I am the proud owner of more than 50 Zappa CDs. Yet I am continually returning to this two-CD collection because it is so unbelievably rich. Musicianship is top-knotch, production values are incredible (How did he capture studio-quality sound from live performances?), the variety and intensity are absolutely amazing. There are musical stunt-people on this album that will blow you away. And if you're hard-core Zappa fan who also loves Led Zeppelin, you'll find the group's rendition of Stairway to Heaven to be worth the price of the set. And Jimmy Hendrix fans will get a kick out of Ike Willis' Step'n'Fetchit version of Purple Haze.<br />If you're new to Zappa, this is a great place to start. If you're an old fan, you'll be pleased with the high quality and range of the performances.
B00000AFGM|3.0|For a man as outspoken as Marilyn Manson, I never understood why he constantly paraded himself on MTV when this was released.  &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; is a decent album at best, going more for melodic, industrial, glam rock sounds than the thrash NIN style on his previous &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;.  I love Manson's music, but &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; is such a departure musically it leads one to wonder what Mr. Manson is really all about.  Thankfully, he went back to his old self with his recent,  and best, &quot;Holy Wood&quot;.
B000001Y2U|5.0|From the fast and fureous &quot;live&quot; track, Irresponsible Hate Anthem to the quiet balled &quot;Man that You Fear,&quot; Antichrist Superstar delivers everything anyone would would want in a metal album. The riffs are especially killer, and just about every song has a strong riff that expresses the whole emotion of the song. The lyrics, while they may seem offensive, are really part of a greater story, and when delt with in the context of the album, they lose most of their offensiveness. Once you get over the face that this is Antichrist Superstar by Marilyn Manson, this becomes the ideal heavy album.  A definate must for headbangers and intellectuals alike. If you like this, you'll probably like Tool, Deftones, Slipknot, Nine Inch Nails, and Rage Against the Machine.
B000009QPE|5.0|This is Slayer at their nastiest, their loudest, and so insane there's no way to describe it.  The legendary &quot;Angel of Death&quot; starts off with ferocious ribcracking guitars from Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, over the top drumming from the great Dave Lombardo, and Tom Araya's inhuman scream.  After listening to this entire album I am convinced Tom Araya is Satan himself, don't believe me?, listen to the fantastic &quot;Postmortem&quot; and the epic &quot;Raining Blood&quot;, and you will hear the awesome slaytanic power that is the one, the only Slayer.  A true classic.
6304083769|4.0|This has to be one of the best animes that i have ever seen. It looms in the shadows of more popular animes such as Akira and Golgo 13. The overall atmosphere of this movie seems as if the Matrix was based on it. Some of the similarities you will be able to identify right of the bat. The film also has a great plot line. One of most original ones in Japanese animation in the recent years. It doesn't follow where you have a male hero who makes love to a least one women during the film. The movie is one of the most groundbreaking and entertaining of all anime. The only reason it deserved four stars instead of five, was that it did not develop the characters as most would like it to.
B00005A46T|4.0|When I first heard of Slipknot in 1999 when they released their self-titled album, I didn't really think much of them.  I figured they were probably just another rap-metal act jumping on the bandwagon, as unoriginal and manufactured as other such acts as Limp Bizkit and P.O.D.  However, I heard from a friend that Slipknot was definitely something different.  After I heard the song \\"Spit It Out\\" they reminded me more of older metal bands, especially Slayer and Sepultura.  I decided to buy Slipknot at a used music store, and was definitely not dissapointed.  Slipknot is a much heavier and percussion-driven band than any other mainstream metal act to surface in the 90's.  Clever songwriting and slick productions made their first record one of my new favorites, so needless to say, I was looking forward to their new album, Iowa.  As contested by Slipknot themselves, Iowa is much heavier and darker than the last record.  Most of the melody from songs on the self-titled such as \\"Wait and Bleed\\", \\"Spit It Out\\" and \\"Eyeless\\" is gone, but replaced with sludgy, head-banging cuts such as \\"People=...\\", \\"My Plague\\", and especially, \\"The Heretic Anthem\\".  The only real melody to be found on Iowa is in \\"Left Behind\\".  The record will of course satisfy Slipknot fans who loved songs such as \\"(sic)\\" and \\"Surfacing\\". An admirable follow-up which would be a great choice for anyone who is looking for something harder, and for a change from the TRL-friendly, teen pop-metal, dominating the mainstream metal scene.
B000008H1Y|2.0|I just sat down to try to listen to &quot;Songs From the Wood&quot; for possibly the 6th or 7th time... and once again failed. The title track works up a little momentum, &quot;Jack-In-The-Green&quot; tries to shine past a garbled vocal, and &quot;Cup of Wonder&quot; might actually be a good song if I could understand any of the lyrics. I can't make it past the first minute of any of the rest of the songs, with their nonsensical time and key changes, hideously buzzy synthesizers, and randomly tricky production. The things I loved about Jethro Tull's music on prior recordings - melodicism matched with off-kilter chord progressions, breadth of sound and scope, and Ian Anderson's incredibly lyrics and individual voice - are absent here; this is a cut-and-slash headache, where most songs sound like the first 15 seconds weren't even introduced to the next 10. Most frustrating, beneath it all I think I can hear those same great lyrics and bits and pieces of that melodicism and warmth, like broken artifacts from a once rich but long-ravaged burial. This is a brutally disappointing recording.
6304119046|5.0|To hell with technical achievement, camera shticks and the like (even if they were important).<br />This movie is great not just because of those things, or because it's about the fact that rich people can be just as lonely and hopeless as anyone (despite having lots of money). It's because it illustrates the theme so amazingly well with Welles' landmark portrayal of Charles Foster Kane. It is believable, which is the highest compliment anyone can pay to a job an actor does. You see Kane as a real person, and like the guys in the movie, you try to understand him - but you can't. Kane is a man who's desperate to be loved, but who himself is incapable of loving anyone. The result is that when he dies, there's utterly no one to remember him, and no one that has ever understood him - themes and images near and dear to my heart.<br />The reporters in the movie are trying to figure out what Kane meant with his dying words. In the process, they try to figure out Kane himself, but they fail, because no one was close enough to Kane to understand. Kane is a man who, despite having amassed unbelievable wealth, has wasted his entire life. He has no appreciation of art or culture or beauty even though he collects statues, builds opera houses, and marries beautiful women. His life is concentrated on &quot;getting stuff&quot; for no real reason. There's an amazing scene in the end where his wealth is just lying in piles and some workers just throw it in the fireplace (since no one wants to buy it). Everything is really expensive - finely crafted chairs, Oriental rugs, paintings - but there's so much of it and it's all in piles, so it looks like trash. And that's the point of the movie - the American Dream as it's commonly known is hollow.<br />Of course, all that would just be preaching if not for Welles' performance, which is outstanding, and creates a truly powerful film. I definitely recommend seeing it.
B000002V07|4.0|Hope Sandoval's lyrics and vocal style puts her in a special unique group of songwriters and singers. The closest songwriter/singer that Hope comes next to is Nico. Nico performed on the first Velvet Underground album, but decided to go off into a solo career.<br />Nico's solo work never gained any popular acceptance. Her voice and her bleak world-weary lyrics did not endear herself to a wide audience in the 70's. She was re-discovered by the Punk Rockers because of her ties to the Velvet Underground in the late 1970's, but even they didn't fully accept her. <br />Nico is the root for all of &quot;Goth&quot; music, and her world-weariness and sadness can be heard in Hope Sandoval, Nine Inch Nails, and Bryan Ferry (both in Roxy Music and his solo career).<br />Nico, Hope Sandoval, and Bryan Ferry have the same sadness and regret mixed in their music. In the case of Nico, the sadness and pain is so unbearable that you can only take her music in small doses (like one song at a time). In the case of Bryan Ferry, at least his world-weariness is combined with uplifting music and irony. <br />The other person singer/songwriter I hear in Hope Sandoval is Stevie Nicks. In some of her songs, she plays around with the same mysticism with elements of witchcraft references. In a sense, these Mazzy Star songs sound like Stevie Nicks on heroin.<br />There are three masterpieces on this album: Fade Into You,<BR>Blue Light, and Into Dust. The rest of the album has moments, but these songs are the jewels for me.<br />I've listened to &quot;Fade Into You&quot; hundreds of times, and although I know the song is about a relationship with a lover, the meaning of the song is still a mystery to me. Is the song saying that merging with her lover is scaring her and causing her to lose her sense of self? Is the song a love song to a lover or a song of contempt?   <br />The song &quot;Blue Light&quot; is another song that still mystifies me. What is the &quot;Blue Light from my best friend's room.&quot;?. Is the song about UFO's? Is the song about ghosts and spirits? I don't know, but listening to the song always opens itself up to interpretation (which is the sign of a great work of art).<br />Although I've heard &quot;Into Dust&quot; hundreds of times, it actually still sends chills up my spine when I hear it and listen to it carefully. What is this song about, really? Is it about wanting to be dead, and no longer having to suffer? Is it about the realization that death is always near us? Is it about the realization that love is not eternal, that most of the time love dies and relationships don't last, or that even if love lasts it ends finally in physical death? The song has elements of the Buddhist view that all things are temporal (all things are temporary, nothing lasts).
B000002LGQ|5.0|Madonna's most ambitious album of the '80s definetly is Like a Prayer. Every album on this song has relatively the same sound with a few minor exceptions. At the time, this was Madonna's most mature effort to date. It is equally one of the best albums of her carreer. The title song is great. Express Yourself, Cherish, Dear Jessie, Keep it Together, Oh Father, and Act of Contrition are my personal favorites. Buy this album!

0679879269|5.0|I fit into the right catagory for this, and I thought that this was absolutely breathtaking.  I'd like to see other people try to whisk up a whole book with all the ends that were left from the first two, and still manage to get the same amount of depth.  <br />Some people have critiscised it for thrusting too vigourously the author's views into the storyline.  I think that's great.  You have all the undercurrents to form ideas based on your own views from the other books, and Pullman's views served (for me) to allow me to deciede whether I agreed and could use what he said, or to disagree and wonder why and where I think he went wrong.<br />I loved the character of Lyra in 'Northern Lights' (I read it as Northern Lights, and I'm sticking to it) but I thought she was a bit muted in the second book.  But in the third she came back into her own, changed but recognizable.  And I thought that a great touch was that the characters, instead of falling so neatly like other childrens books (Potter for instance) into black and white / bad or good, fell into different shades of gray material in the middle.  <br />As for people who hate this book for it's religious views:  I was brought up Christian by my parents, and it didn't bother me.  Children can't be crushed into believing because the parents do.  They have to figure it out for themselves, and often turn out to be more capable than adults believe.  Writing must be able to explore, and people have to realise that there are thousands of views out there, and in all probibility none of them are totally correct in all accounts.  I think this offers a chance to talk over with your children your own personal beliefs and give them a chance to think about theirs'.
6301390725|4.0|Keeping up with Disney tradition Bednobs and Broomsticks again stars an all star cast of Angela Landsbury (who has done quite a bit with Disney inluding more recently the voice of Mrs. Potts in Disneys animated version of Beauty and the Beast in 1992), in this movie she plays an absent minded mail order witch who is in search of the wonderful emelius brown (played by David Thomlinson who did a splendid job seven years before as Mr. Banks in Mary Poppins) who is known for his witch craft schools. The movie takes place during WWII and Landsbury and the three children take a wild ride on a bed to find Mr. Brown and they even travel in the spirit of Mary Poppins and Song of the South into Animation land where they meet up with a lion who holds the key for Landsbury and Thomlinson's characters. This is a must buy and a must watch for anyone ages 1-101 and a great way for you to let your imagination run away with you. You and your children will never look at going to bed in the same way!

You want to know who the murderer is, but there aren't any give aways and you think you know, but you don't! You want to go to the back of the book, but you knew if you did it would spoil the whole book! So I just said ok I'll read it and find out who it is and rub it in everyone's face, well they too read the whole thing before the teacher asked us too!!
B00003CXQX|5.0|Just as Snow White was the start of the full length feature animation and the Little Mermaid started great animated features in the 90's I believe The Emporers New Groove could be the start of some great animated features to come in the new century from Disney and we have seen already other greats come from Disney in the Last year including Emporers New Groove, Recess Schools Out, and more recently Atlantis.  Starring the Voice talents of David Spade and John Goodman it is full of laughs and almost no doubt you and your children for weeks maybe even months after seeing this movie will be saying things like Uh huh, uh huh, uhuhuhuh!, No Touchie, Boom Baby, Somebody's throwing stuff wasn't me! and many many more one liners from this movie! It's a great adventure for both young and old alike!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|this movie is great. it's original, well told, and amusing.  the first time that i saw it, i though that it was a little confusing, but after watching it a second time, i realized that i understood it all the first time.  one question i have though:  how could he remember that he has short term memory loss???????
B00003W8NO|5.0|Disney over the years has been full of firsts that they have done dating all the way back to Snow White and the Seven Dorfs being the first full feature animated classic to DisneyLand and DisneyWorld being the first parks based around a central theme. In this wonderful feature Disney teams up with new icon in the industry Dreamworks productions! Together they make a wonderful production with the wonderful voice talents of Tim Allen from my favorite TV show Home Improvement (also a Disney classic!) and one of if not THE greatest actor of the 90's and the early new century Tom Hanks! You and your children alike will love this wonderful Disney/Dreamworks Computer animated classic! Including the wonderful song &quot;You've got a friend in me!&quot;

B00004R99M|5.0|Disney again places out a fantastic performance with an all star cast of the 50's and 60s Starring Dick Van Dyke as both Bert and Mr. Dawes Sr.; David Tomlinson who starred in many Disney films of the time including Bednobs and Broomstiks stars as Mr. Banks also in the movie are Ed Wynn Karen Dortice and Matthew Garber and of course keeping in the Disney Tradition the Magic continues in this movie.  Walt had such a wonderful imagination to make this wonderful book come to life and all the great special effects were wonderful especially for 1964! The scene where they go into the paintings where we here Jolly Holiday and Supercalifragilisticexpialidcious where Bert and Mary dance with penguins and other characters in an all animated villiage too bad this site doesn't allow for 10 stars because it so much more deserving than a 5 star rating!
B00000AFWW|4.0|The artist: Hole The album: Celebrity Skin. Courtney Love had spent the last couple of years, experimenting with an acting career once again. For those of you who do not know, she started in acting before the music industry with the movie Sid and Nancy. It was the story of Sid Viscous and heroin addicted girlfriend Nancy. Love decided to take her talents to the stage and released a couple of unsuccessful EP's. Now she has 2 successful full length CD's already under her belt. This new release as expected because of the high sales volume of her last album and the long waiting period between CD's had to be different and exciting. This time she brought in her long time friend and sometimes bedmate, Billy Corgan of the successful band the Smashing Pumpkins. Although Billy helped write the music for 5 of the songs Courtney still wrote all of her own lyrics. This combination makes a pretty strong song set for her 3rd full length release. <br />This CD starts out with a grinding grunge guitar anthem, which is also the Title of the CD. Celebrity Skin rips you open right away with massive power chords and fingers plugging her nose, snotty attitude growl style of singing. When the chorus comes you are surprised by her soft voice without the gurgle of spit in the back of her throat. It is almost funny because she has great backing vocals and her hateful lyrics. So far, so good. Great opening song to get you excited and wanting more. <br />Then comes Awful, this song has her odd lyrics once again much like her last CD. It is a bit softer then the opening track. It also has a great hook with the chorus. It makes you want to bob your head up and down. <br />Hit So Hard is a song that sounds like it should have been a rip your face off with grueling bash your brains out guitar but is the opposite, it is very slow and mellow. The lyrics are about physical abuse and makes a bit of a statement. <br />Malibu, another mellow song where Courtney try's to contain her course sound hintingthat she does have some vocal talent. This song really doesn't have a lot of flair but the fact that she sounds good makes it interesting. Next we have what I feel is the strongest track on the CD. <br />Reasons To Be Beautiful has an amazing beat and guitar hook to open the song. Her vocals match the lyrics perfectly. This song is about her once again struggling within herself to keep her sanity about her personal life. The changes in this song make it very interesting because the song keeps your attention the whole time. The backing vocals by her band blend perfectly with the feeling of the song giving it an even finer edge. The closing of the song is a soft completely different feel then the rest of the song. Courtney sounds like she if whining and sobbing during the closing giving it a bit more of a personal feeling. <br />The next song Dying is a very depressing and melancholy song showing Love's battle scars once again with it's haunting lyrics and sedated sounding effects. <br />Use Once & Destroy is another strange song with dark effects and odd off beat sound and glass cutting guitar chords. It almost sounds like she is chanting and panting during this song which keeps building as the song goes on with waves of Jimmy Page style layered flanged guitar chords. <br />The song Northern Star is mellow with acoustic guitars and some synthesizer background sounds. Courtney's voice once again sounding more live then revamped studio layers. This I can appreciate because she will sound very much like this live. A lot of bands focus so much on getting the vocals to be perfect and sound like they can't sing a note live. This song is has a good hook to the chorus once again which makes it very easy to listen to. <br />Boys On The Radio is a song which was left over from her last album and she liked it so much it was a mainstay in her live set. It is a really interesting song because she has mixed acoustic and distorted electric guitars and has that patented whine in hervoice again. The backing vocals add a lot of depth to the song as she sings about a broken love and obviously has a lot of hatred built up under her skin. <br />Heaven Tonight is a huge surprise because it seems like a happy song where you get a glimmer of hope that maybe Courtney is human after all. It is an upbeat song with tender guitar licks and once again very nice backing vocals. This song leaves you feeling happy unlike a lot of her songs which make you want to slit your wrists and fill your veins with heroin. <br />This one is definetly a dandy, Playing Your Song has a strange Indian Sitar sounding opening then you get blasted with grunge power chords and Courtney's abrasive razor blade cutthroat vocal style she has been noted for. This is a really good song and should have been up towards the top of the list. It is beyond me why she stuck this one near the end. <br />Last but not least comes the closing track Petals. This song is another extremely strong track that has an amazing beat and mixes the soft tender guitars with layered distorted guitars. The strong structure of this song almost outweighs Courtney's voice because of the synthesizer effects, which haunt you and close the song with an errie fading into the distance to await her next release feel. <br />Overall I would have to say that this album is her best yet. She has not only mixed in new styles and a lot more musical talent but seems to have attempted to, if I dare say it, almost a pop sound to a lot of the songs. <br />I recommend the CD strongly for anyone who likes female vocalists but still like that bit of an edge with strong guitar backing. I give this CD a rating of 4stars on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. <br />Well that is it for now, Happy Listening.
B00004T37H|5.0|This was a great anime film. I've watched it 5 times, and I've only had the movie for 2 days. There is blood, but no gore. I like the stunning animation and music. (I'm gonna get the soundtrack soon.) The relationship between the characters was great too.  The only thing that confuses me is, why do the animals' mouthes move so funny when they're talking?  Overall, I thought that the movie was great! I sugest that you buy it.
B000001EUL|5.0|My sister used to play this album while getting ready for school. <BR>I had never heard of the Scorpions in 1980, but I'll forever be gratefull to her. This is the first of a fantastic trilogy of Scorpion albums that I would purchase; the other two being, Animal Magnetism and Black Out. Over the years, I've managed to purchase all their albums, but this one is special. The instrumental, Coast to Coast is the purest form of rock and roll. There is no other song I've ever heard that tug at my soul as this song does. Always Somewhere and Holiday are incredible ballads, and Loving You Sunday Morning and Lovedrive are equally incredible rockers. Every song on this album is awesome. This is 35 minutes of pure rock and roll energy that puts most 70 minute modern day rock CDs to absolute shame. My hat off to Matthias, Rudolf, Michael, Klaus, Herman and Francis. This is an absolute must have!...
B00004R99U|3.0|The three stars are for the technical items - music, entertainment value, movie quality.  Your kids won't be disappointed and it is a worthy sequel.<br />Many reviews have wondered why so many are up in arms in regards to the Pocahontas movies, when other classic stories have been altered for contemporary audiences. It's very simple - Pocahontas, John Smith / Rolfe and even poor Ratcliffe were REAL people, not myths.  To fictionalize their lives is an injustice to them and their descendants.  Ratcliffe gets a bum rap, in particular (we always have to have a villian, right?). How would you feel if you were a descendant of this man and the way he is treate in these movies? Smith and Rolfe both come out smelling like roses, when their true stories are not so innocent.<br />As for Pocahontas herself, hers was a very short (she only lived to be about 22) story.  She was only 10 or 11 when she met the much older John Smith (more of a father figure than a lover), she most likely married John Rolfe (a tobacco planter) to be removed from a year of captivity.  She converted to Christianity and had a child before she ever went to England.  And she died on her way back to Jamestown, right after &quot;PII&quot; ends.  Take this movie and the previous one for what it is - PURE FICTION.  If your kids ask, tell them the same, as there is as much fact here as Hercules, Hunchback of ND, Peter Pan or any other Disney movie.

B000002GJH|5.0|&quot;Now I'm warm from the candle/ But I feel too cold to burn/ He came from an island/ And he died from the street/ He hurt so bad like a soul breaking/ But he never said nothing to me/ Say hello to heaven...&quot;<br />Understand, Temple of the Dog was not meant to be a commodity. IT was a one time collaboration of several talented musicians to honor the memory of Andrew Wood, the late lead singer of Mother Love Bone. Chris Cornell, Mike McCready, Matt Cameron, Jeff Ament, and Stone Gossard joined their efforts to create this album. Eddie Vedder's voice is present in certain songs. All in all, this is an amazing collection of emotion-driven ballads, mellow yet powerful, representing a tough time. <br />The most recognizable song on here would probably be &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;, in which Cornell and Vedder sing separately, then together. If you are a fan of Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, or Mother Love Bone, this should interest you. I think that anyone who appreciates the mellow side of grunge rock will like TOTD. Remember it was only meant to be a one-time thing and enjoy it for all it's worth.
B00005ALP6|5.0|I highly recommend this musical movie to anyone. The songs and costumes are lovely. I'd give it five stars if I could. It's a movie for the entire family to enjoy.  Audrey Hepburn gives one of her best performances of her career.  She as well as Julie Andrews will both always be remembered in the roe of Eliza. Rex Harrison reprises his broadway role as Henry Higgens, which he does brilliantly, and Jeremy Brett is supberb as Freddie- Heinsferd- Hill.  He's a very wonderful actor as well.
B00005A46T|5.0|All of these reviews are no &)@&#)(@. This is some great, aggressive, dark metal. It really is. I barely listen to anything in the mainstream with the exception of Nails, Zombie, Slayer, Pantera, Fear Factory, and Tool. I usually listen to very underground stuff like Today Is The Day and Neurosis. If you're heavily underground and you never try anything mainstream then this is a good opportunity to swallow your pride and walk into any store(how easy is that) and buy this disc. I'm also a bit of an audiophile and I have to say this is a beautiful recording. Ross Robinson along with Slipknot have their Reign In Blood or their Vulgar Display of Power. I'm not #$&$(*#& you! Go get it. The first 2 cuts go together beautifully and the rest of it is great also. I love every song here. Memorable heavy riffs abound. Some black metal influences aiding in the sound of a few songs too.  I never skip around the cd. It's one you'll put in and play as you walk around the room amazed at it's clarity, rawness, and POWER above all. Their primary drummer deserves some sort of reward. Watch out Vinnie Paul and Dave Lombardo, this guy pounds the toms and kicks the double bass.  Man, what a heavy great-sounding record! Go get it if you need your musical fix heavy and made by craftsmen. Also sounds great in the car if you have a killer system. I believe this album to be so good that it'll be put up on a pedastal for years to come. It got a good scary vibe to it, especially the last song. They use atmospherics well here. I saw 'em at Ozzfest and they were great but I can't wait to see 'em when they come to Baltimore right before Halloween.
B0000029J5|5.0|I have been a fan of the Blues, Swing, Jazz, Rock and Folk music for many years. In my life I have only heard one artist as versatile as Keb' Mo' and that was Van Morrison. I bought this CD based on one track (Love Blues) that I heard on an internet radio station. This CD delivered so much more than I expected. And what I expected was pretty high. He's all over the place and he's excellent at whatever musical genre he puts his hand to. Forget the Robert Johnson comparisons. Robert Johnson was great but the comparison is unfair in that it limits the view of this artist's versatility. He does so much more. <br /> On a negative note, I am going to watch my nickles and dimes for the next few months to make sure I can acquire every scrap of his music that's available. I am green with envy after reading the review by the person who saw him in concert with Bonnie Raitt and John Lee Hooker.
0553573403|5.0|George R.R. Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\" certainly has a lot to compete with, especially with talented writers such as Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind's caliber dominating the epic fantasy scene. But George R.R. Martin has achieved a individuality in his writing that is hard to ignore. His style is far different than that of Goodkind and Jordan, and his story-telling much more intricate.<br />George R.R. Martin has created a breathtaking world full of feuding houses and lords, a world where there is no one who is wholly good or evil, a world where a dark threat looms to the cold wastelands in the north.<br />His writing is just right. It doesn't become needlessly descriptive in areas that don't really matter, but it somehow accomplishes painting a picture that is perfectly clear in your mind. I found that Martin seems to accomplish more in a chapter than, say, Jordan who sometimes takes pages and pages just describing characters clothing or facial expressions. Martin uses the english language beautifully.<br />Conversation between characters seem much more realistic and natural as opposed to other books where conversation seems  stiff and contrived. This makes the text seem very believable, and a whole new world opens up in front of you. The intricacy of this work, as I mentioned before, is astronomical. Martin is controlling a lot of information here, and he does it masterfully.<br />The pages just flew by as I read, and I finished this book very quickly. Sometimes I would be so caught up in the land of Westeros that I would read for hours and hours without becoming fazed. Only a select few can do this for me, and Martin is at the top of that list.<br />In conclusion this is a book that no one should miss, whether you are a fan of Epic Fantasy or not. Read it, enjoy it, and become a George R.R. Martin fan.
0345406680|5.0|I first heard about Mr. Lomax in the &quot;Guidepost&quot; magazine, and was eleven when I read this &quot;the Railway Man&quot;.  And I must say, it's a painful read.  After reading an eye-witness account of the treatment of the prisonners, &quot;Bridge to the River Kwai&quot; seems so...tame.  This is the real stuff.<br />It's graphic, like when he drescribes the brutal treatment at the hands of the captors, the endless interrogations, being swarmed over by red ants when they were put in cages, and about the man who tortured him all those years.<br />Then he talks about going back to England, marrying, and then the jolt of his former torturer being alive.  And that they met up again, and how he forgave.  <br />I'm surprised it's out of print, and I still think it should be more widely read.  The story may be gut-wrenching (in more ways than one), but when he survived it all, one can't help but wonder how, when so many have died along the way.
B000003TA4|5.0|i think that this cd is one of my favorites ever. i love the songs, &quot;smells like teen spirit&quot;, &quot;come as you are,&quot; &quot;lithium,&quot; but my favorite song would be &quot;in bloom.&quot; &quot;in bloom&quot; is one of my favorite songs of all time. so i really recommend this CD.
0140277447|4.0|This is not an entertaining book.  In fact, it's a full scale, IN YOUR FACE account of arguably THE most autrocious crime in WW2.  <br />The Japanese forces invaded Nanking in mid-december and left at the end of January, leaving a trail of mass destruction, shameless slaughter, and 300,000 people dead.  For six weeks, civilians in Nanking were systematically and ruthlessly raped, tortured and killed (usually all three).  One shudders to wonder what would have happened had they stayed.  <br />Ms. Chang did an excellent job uncovering the truth  (although &quot;truth&quot; itself if subjective and faceted) about this forgotten holocaust.  It's a retching read, with the graphic descriptions of torture, as well as the pictures.  Like of the captives being buried alive, or the boy tied at a stake to be used as target practice, these pictures are worth a thousand words, and are a mute testimony that this had really happened.  <br />Intersped, though, are tales of heroism, most notably that of John Rabe, whom she calls &quot;the Good German of Nanking&quot; (who, for all he did -a review said he &quot;out-Schindlered Schindler&quot;- during the war, was a near-pariah when he got back home to Germany), and a group of expatriates who refused to leave the city when all foreigners were ordered to evacuate.  Their safety zone save up to 250,000 lives.  Most civilians who did not make it in had ultimately perished.<br />While the incident was downplayed, both by the Japanese government and was hardly known in America for years, the survivors died off.  Now that the Americas are getting to know more about it, the denials still ring.  How long will it be before it's known all over?<br />And yet, despite all the senseless horror, there was a plea to never forget, like with the Holocaust in Europe, and a little hope, because no one who has read about it (the Rape of Nanking) ever will.
2070513289|5.0|When I first read this book when I was a senior in high school  and read it for my French class, I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this book.  I'd heard so much about it.  After reading it I can say that I love this book so much, no wonder Le Petit Prince is on some French currency!  I've read this book in English and French, and I'd have to say that the French is sooo much better if you know French.  It's not all that difficult to understand if you are at a beginning level.  This is a great book and is worth every penny in both languages!
B000002NJS|5.0|This is one my favorite if not the best of all of Madonna's albums. There just seems to a great flow throughout the CD that makes this not seem so 'put together' and I like that. There are no fillers on this disk. There are songs to get up and dance to and songs to chill to but everything falls so nicely into place. I'm glad that Madonna took a chance to explore electronica music because Ray of Light sounds even better than the CD's done by other electronica artists. My favorite tracks are Drowned World, Swim, Sky Fits Heaven and The Power of Goodbye. Ray of Light is a must buy CD for anyone wanting to buy Madonna music. You gotta start from somewhere, why not with this one.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is one of the most spectacular Sci Fi Movies of the 20th Century.  Not totally originally, but it combines elements of so many previous Sci Fi flicks that it's more like a tribute to those previous stories.  It may not be totally original, but the combination of aspects have never been more originally executed.  The use of the wires during fight scenes and the rotating angles (bullet speed as they call it) give the movie a visual sense of a created world, something that is not real and can be manipulated.  The movie takes place somewhere in the future, opening with a glimpse of the life of Neo (Reeves in a role he was most likely born to play), a computer programmer working for a large corporation who does hacker work in his off time.  After being discovered for his illegal extracurricular activity, Neo is intercepted by a mysterious woman, Trinity (the striking Carrie-Anne Moss) who claims to know what or actually who, he is looking for;  Morpheous, a charismatic mystery man played by Fishbourne, who gives a strong leader performance.  Morpheous believes Neo is the coming messiah who will save mankind, but from what?  That is where the question, `What is the Matrix?' comes in.  Explaining it takes a few different scenes and although it's a fairly simple concept, the motivations behind it all take a little more length in detail.  As the questions unfold, Neo starts to realize his destiny and the action escalates as the movie moves on.  The inclusion of high energy martial arts fighting scenes are so ingeniously integrated into the movie as well as other aspects of action, that you have to applaud the writers and directors.  With this concept, you could put almost anything into this story line.  To state anymore may ruin the plot but simply put, Matrix makes you wonder about your own world.  The disturbing questions it brings to the surface make you question the validity of your own existence, and that is where the most frightening aspects of The Matrix lie.  Part Science Fiction, part twilight zone, part action movie and part big-brother paranoia propaganda, The Matrix suggests that we should question everything around us and supplement our minds with things that are outside the realm of what we accept as everyday thinking.  Packed with extra features for the DVD player as well as the DVD ROM for your PC, this is definitely worth the money.  No one can be told what The Matrix is, you have to see it, so buy the DVD and see for yourself.
B000056V73|3.0|The acting is the best part of this movie. Everything about Billy Crudup's performance is right on target. His expressions, movements and speaking are just right. His character comes across as likeable and very believable. Frances McDormand, as usual, is exceptional. Patrick Fugit, Kate Hudson are also real and refreshing. There just isn't any bad acting in this movie.<br />I didn't think the movie itself was all that memorable but the acting was so good, it made the movie quite enjoyable.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Why rehash all the stuff already written here? While Ep 1 is no where near as good as Ep 4 &amp; 5, it was BETTER than ROTJ. Aside from Luke's confrontation with the emperor and Vader, ROTJ is a joke! It took all the great developments of Ep 4 &amp; 5 and flushed them down a toilet with a bunch of stupid muppets! I'll take Jar Jar over the Ewoks anyday! Ep 1 had many great scenes and the beginning of a great story. While it's no Empire, it's still better than Jedi. As far as the CGI, it isn't by any means perfect, but it's a great alternative to the Muppet Show which Jedi is!
0671027573|5.0|I've read many of her books (I am working my way through the older ones) and so far have not been disappointed.  Definitely one of the best I've read. Don't miss it.
B000059XUI|1.0|Hello everyone, I must say that I am extremely displeased with Superman II DVD.  There are several reasons.  My first reason is that it is a Dobly Surround, and not digitally remastered in Dobly Digital.  Who would want to hear the opening credits and Superman II score, which was adapted from John Williams, and composed by some other guy for this movie??  That leads into my 2nd reason for not purchasing this DVD.  Missing from Superman 2 are John Williams and Richard Donner.  For Superman II, Richard Donner was replaced with Richard Lester.  Everyone knows that Richard Lester is a very, very acomplished director.  After all, his claim to fame is the Beatles' A Hard Day's Night.  Granted, the better scenes in this movie were directed by Donner, basically, every scene with Gene Hackman was part of Donner's vision.  THe scene in Houston was Lester's vision.  According to Lester's vision, it is apparant that Texans talk with an English accent.  The scenes directed by Lester and plain silly, and hurt the film.  In the first film, Superman can catch a speeding bullet, and why not??  Stuff like that makes him super, but in II, he trips over a carpet and lands in fire, in turn, that's how Lois finds out he is Superman.  So Lester wants me to believe that the perfect man has now become a clutz.  Yea right.  In Donner's orginal vision, Lois Lane put Clark Kent to a test to find out if he is Superman.  She pulls out a gun and shoots him (this can be scene in the bonus material in Superman DVD).  Now that is more believable.  Rumors have been circulating around the web, and hopefully they are true,but the rumor is that Richard Donner and Warner Bros (AOL-Time Warner), are gonna dig into their movie collection and pull out the original Superman II film, and make a brand new Superman II movie.  This version will be known as Richard Donner's Superman II, where the script is not campy, there is no forced humor, and the movie stays honest to the audience.  Gone will be the opeing sequence in Paris, the silly Niagra Falls will be replaced with the original Niagra Falls vision.  As a big Superman fan, I would hope that when Richard Donner creates his Superman II, that he will bring John Williams in to rescore the movie.  Now, the one problem is that Richard Donner filmed only 70% of the Superman II.  The Houston and Battle over Metropolis was filmed by Lester.  I'm assuming (and hoping) that Donner will reshoot parts of those scenes, and splice them into the movie, and remove some silliness.  I'm hoping the army is removed, and reshot.  With the computer capabilities in this day and age, I couldn't see how Donner couldn't tailor the scene to the way he wanted it, or at least make it close.  I'm sure everyone has scene Star Wars: Special Edition.  And I hope Donner removes the scene with Mt. Rushmore (Mr. Lester, what were you thining?).  And in the Battle of Metropolis, hopefully Donner removes the silly parts, such as the an talking on the phone, the man losing his wig, and the ice cream flying in the air.  If this rumor is turns out to be true, of Donner finally realizing his vision, then I advise everyone to save their money, and purchase Richard Donner's version.  People must remember that Richard Donner is one of three very special directors, along with Tim Burton and Brian Singer, he was able to take a comic book character and make a believable movie.  To close my review, I suggest everyone to purchase Superman, and wait until Richard DOnner's Superman II is released.  I know the only Superman II DVD that I will ever buy, will be Richard Donner's version.
1559408898|4.0|This is one of the best Sci-fi films ever made, in its full uncut form. Ok so it may be a little more graphic, but that's how the director originally wanted it to be, and to me it does make the film more enjoyable, under-lining the importance of those extended scenes. The quality of this edition is rather good, with image quality really high, although only releasing it in Dolby Surround seems a bit of a waste (but you can still get very good sound reproduction when played though a good DD amp). All in all a film that any Sci-fi fan will love, and if you havn't seen it yet, it's definately worth grabbing!!!!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Absolutely amazing! I left the theatre wanting to go right back and watch Memento all over again. It was so nice not to know what was going to happen next unlike most every hollywood movie these days. Great plot, wonderful acting, not for those who don't like to think during a film. I can't wait to see it again!
B0000029LG|5.0|Yeh true,not all his best songs are included but a damn good number of them are!You're not going to get all his songs onto one album so if ur just going to buy one,then buy this one.But if u like him as much as me and the rest of the world then dont stop at just one,buy them all and look out for his new album. You'll thank me!!
B00004XQ83|5.0|I have a confession to make my personal preference in music is Rock/Alternative. however, I love this album if not the best it is one of the best soundtracks I have heard in the last 10 years. For the country music lover it holds more of the old tyme style of country it is more of a mix of folk and country than the rock country mix of today. I would recommend this album to anyone country music fan or not.
6302787556|4.0|It was very difficult for me to go through with this film. However, the topic of race is probrably very uncomfortable to many Americans, whatever their skin color. If we are to move in the future we must discuss and learn about the controversies of the past. This includes Malcolm X, Nathan Bedford Forrest, and George Wallace. It was a little degrading at the end when Lee was praising racist Afrocentric education, the Kennedy assasination, and Black Power. Despite Malcolm's eccentric behavior, his point was clear that African Americans should be treated better by America. He was proud of his race, loved the African American people and his family, and his rejection of the Nation of Islam to embrace Whites as brothers were very positive in improving race relations. Very good and honest view of Malcolm X.
6304362498|5.0|I don't understand why anyone would give this movie less than five stars.  It is excellent.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Everybody who has seen Silence of the Lambs is entitled to consider it one of the best thrillers of all time, because there is no denying the fact that it is true. However, I believe strongly that everybody who was bashing Hannibal, which is a tremendous film, was simply blinded by these thoughts. A few words of wisdom: STOP COMPARING THE TWO MOVIES! Silence of the Lambs was no better than Hannibal is, it is just different. They are both equally tremendous works of art and I'm so sorry if Hannibal was just too intense and violent for some of you whiny crybabies out there! GET OVER IT! If you can't take the heat, stay out of the fire, that's my motto. Also, if the plot was too hard to follow for some of you out there, I'm only 15, and I was still able to understand it after viewing it only once! Here's an idea: why don't you actually try and make an attempt to PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL! So, what I suggest any readers of this review do is buy or rent the film, and base your own opinions on it. You won't be sorry.
B000023X9W|3.0|&quot;Silver + Gold&quot; contains Neil Young's basic song setups from years past.  Speckled with innocuous, repititous lyrics, there are few surprises.  However, there are some true stand-out tracks.  &quot;The Great Divide&quot; and &quot;Buffalo Springfield&quot; are inventive upbeat tracks, the latter a song lamenting about Neil Young's late sixties rock band.  &quot;Horseshoe Man&quot; is a heart-breaking ballad, one of Young's best.  The remaining songs seems like Neil Young 'rehash', but it's not that bad.  Thanks to veteran drummer Jim Keltner, the songs contain fresh beats, but unfortunately, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt are sorely underused as backup singers.  Not much new, but still good Neil Young magic.
B000059XUY|5.0|This is the best Disney cartoons of the 80's beside 'The Fox & The Hound', 'Oliver and Company' has very good characters, the movie is not too long for the kids (For younger kids it may be too intense at the last chasescene), the song are entertaining, the sound effects is great, there is some great computer animations, there are many fine details, and Sykes is one of the best Disney villians ever.<BR>But some of the bad things are the animation, and that Rita's and Dodger's songs are cut down.
B000002IFN|5.0|Simply Red just simply soars on this album. There's not a weak moment in this collection; all are very good. I really like all the songs but I must said that the song &quot;Suffer&quot; is an instant classic, great song. Then the rest is as good as Suffer, specially the reggae anthem &quot;Love Fire&quot; just awesome. Go and get this CD.
B000056Q81|5.0|Françoise Hardy was one of my favorite icons of the '60's, with her sweet clear voice, her songwriting talent, and her incredible style. She just oozed style. Eventually getting bored with the life fame brought her, she followed her own path out of the limelight, but these songs from the &quot;ye ye&quot; years of international stardom are a treat for her fans.<br />Though some of the early tracks have less than perfect production and backup musicians, it's a terrific overview of her early career. She penned 40 of the 50 songs on this CD set, and some of them are beauties. &quot;L'amour ne dure pas Toujours&quot;, &quot;La Nuit est sur la Ville&quot;, &quot;Voila&quot;, and many more.<br />There's a gentleness and a simplicity to these songs that delights me, and her voice, though limited, is expressive and appealing. The booklet insert is excellent, with lots of photos, a bio, and detailed song info...to quote from it, &quot;...the Françoise Hardy of the mid sixties still looks and sounds truly modern&quot;, and I agree wholeheartedly.

0060934913|4.0|When you describe a book as being hilarious, you don't always mean that you also learned something--or that there was anything worthwhile about the book other than it having given you a laugh or two.  Tony Bourdain's &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; handily accomplishes all these goals and more.  You'll never look at restaurant eating the same way again.  Worried about that little greasy spoon you hit for lunch every day?  Wait until you read about how things go even at the chi-chi, high-end New York City restaurants--in the kitchen, at the bar, when food is delivered, and so on.  Bourdain examines the type of personality drawn to restaurant work in every form--he looks not only at the executive chefs, but the prep cooks, the waiters, the hostesses, the owners (like the ones who want to own a restaurant just so they can display their good taste in furniture), the &quot;runners,&quot; the bartenders, and the delivery men.  His eye is acute and unerring and ruthless, most especially when he descibes his own foibles and quirks.  This is a superb read and a must-have for anyone who has waitressed, cooked, or otherwise worked in a restaurant even if they only lasted a day or two.
B00005KHJR|5.0|I posted earlier when I had first bought this set. I've watched it again carefully and done some research -- and yes, the 99 minute &quot;extended version&quot; here is indeed complete! The American video release, despite being variously billed as 102-104 minutes, is in fact 99, just as here. The DVD release, in fact, has some brief scenes that were NOT on the video. Unless some further original footage surfaces, THIS IS THE REAL THING! BUY IT!
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Angelina Jolie has been known for her seperable performances in several movies. However, her career is exploding with new movies and earning herself an Academy Award for her portrayl of a mental patient, Lisa, in &quot;Girl Interrupted&quot; co-starring Winona Ryder, Whoopi Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave. She was recently in the thriller &quot;Original Sin&quot; starring Antonio Banderas and Thomas Jane. Jolie is an incredible actress and no-one could have portrayed Lara Croft better than Jolie.<BR>        Jolie (&quot;Hackers&quot;, &quot;Pushing Tin&quot;, &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;) was well-equipped for this role having gone through massive training in different fields of fighting. Lara Croft:Tomb Raider starts out with Croft finding clues to an ancient mystery that can lead to destruction of entire lands. She has the Clock of Ages in her possession, but not for long. Croft gathers clues to find out what to do and where to look. Guided by the wisdom of her late father (Jon Voight, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;Anaconda&quot;, &quot;Enemy Of  The State&quot;), she discovers that the Clock of Ages has to be placed in different temples to obtain the parts of a Pyramid. Once fully together, the possessor of this pyramid will have ultimate power. Croft is ahead of another  tomb raider guiding someone to these ancient temples. Once everything is complete, the battle for world domination begins in this adventurous movie with laughs and lots of action and great special effects.<BR>       This movie is great and a really good treat. The DVD should be amazing with having lots of special features. Well, I'm definently going to buy this one because of its one-of-a-kind script, effects, action and cast. Jolie is brilliant. I can't wait to see her in the follow-up to this great action movies. But, Jolie only agrees to come back as Croft if the script is 100 times better!
0425170349|1.0|All the stereotypes are here: the big men with their big guns, the crazed terrorists with their slightly smaller guns and for good measure he throws in a bunch of mad enviromentalists ready to wipe out the entire population of the earth. It's clear that Clancy stopped doing research for his books years ago (his lack of knowlege is pretty glaring - he obviously doesn't know the difference between the Provos and the INLA) and this book proves that he could no longer bother to think up a plot either. The book is little more that a set of predictable action sequences strung together on the back of an absurd story which, thankfully, is little more than filler.<br />If you enjoy a good thriller, read one of the masters like Forsyth or le Carrier. If you enjoy books written by a computer program, read Tom Clancy.
B00001OH1S|4.0|I like this soundtrack quite a bit. Not only does it play well in the background of the original movie (a 3 out of 5 for me), but it has some great finds on here that I wouldn't have heard otherwise. Of course, &quot;Sinner Man&quot; by Nina Simon is one of the best, but so is &quot;Everything&quot; by Wasis. I can't honestly say that the rest of the unknown songs on the track may be as memorable (except for the Sting song), but it's a good buy. Again, makes for great background music...for a cocktail party, while working, or taking a leisurely drive.
B000002699|5.0|I first bought In A Silent Way when I was faced with a year long depression that was prompted by a vapid time in my life.  I bought this album to try and feel better about myself.  It turned out to have a profound impact on me.  No other album can make me feel the way I felt the first time I listened to this.  It evokes this odd combination of emotions.  The first track, Shhh/peaceful creates a spacy scene, a fluid PERFECT song.  The rhythmic continuity provided by the hi-hat and the bass provide the basis of a free-verse poem; a quiet reflection.<BR>       The second song is like another world.<BR>       The first time I listened to this song I nearly cried.  It's definitely, the most powerful song I've ever heard.  I wish I could understand how people can make music sound like that.  It's just amazing.  Both of the songs reflect my most pensive moods.  This is real music.<BR>                           <BR>                          BUY IT.
B000002MUW|5.0|I love this CD. One of Madonna's best, undoubtedly. If you're one to run out and buy a CD only because of what industry critics say, then don't even bother reading further. Otherwise, as a true fan, a music aficiniado, or simply one who loves a great mix of Madonna songs, you must own this one. Probably my most fave album of hers, next to &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Something to Remember&quot;.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather (1972) is the unquestionable greatest movie of all time.  Brando is awesome.  He is so good.  I like that movie more than II and III.  I think everyone does.  Hope you like it.
B000002N3J|5.0|Simply put, this is one of Madonna's best albums. My most favorite, absolutely-can't-do-without songs are &quot;Take a Bow&quot; and &quot;You'll See&quot;. What fabulously emotive songs, esp. since the latter seems to follow the former like a sequel to a story. The rest of the album is wonderful, too. &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; is one that gives you a rush, as does the remixed version of &quot;Love Don't Live Here Anymore&quot; (hey, did she look amazing in the remake of that video or WHAT??). I could go on. I love, love, love, LOVE this CD. Did I mention that I love it?  I do!  So are you a Madonna fan?  Not if you don't own this one!
B00003W8NM|1.0|&quot;Everything's missing in Fight Club, especially a point.&quot;<br />&quot;You're either going to love it or hate it.&quot;<br />Bloody mess of a guy film loses its battle to have any real meaning.&quot;<br />&quot;Fight Club is a work of prevailing violence.&quot;<br />   &quot;Fight Club is a distinctively dense and often hilarious film, but in the end it's nonsense.&quot;<BR>-- Andrew O'Hehir, SALON.COM<br />   &quot;If, as Fincher has said, this movie is supposed to be funny, then the joke's on us.&quot;<BR>-- Lisa Schwarzbaum, ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY<br />   &quot;If the first rule of Fight Club is 'Nobody talks about Fight Club,' a fitting subsection might be 'Why would anyone want to?'&quot;<BR>-- Kenneth Turan, LOS ANGELES TIMES<br />   &quot;If you want a movie that makes sense and doesn't make you chuckle at its sophomoric satire, laugh this one right off your list.&quot;<BR>-- Desson Howe, WASHINGTON POST<br />   &quot;Terribly underwhelming.&quot;<br />&quot;Fight Club is an empty shout of 'To hell with it all!'&quot;<BR>-- Jay Boyar, ORLANDO SENTINEL<br />&quot;As artistically fascinating as the movie may be, the spiritual sickness that it depicts is, at the very least, distasteful.&quot;<br />&quot;Laughably ludicrous.&quot;<br />I think that sopports my point but if you want it in my own words. It just plianly had no point. Why does this charater do these sick things and why this charater is still alive. Honestly anyone who was invaled with this project deserves to be hanged and tared and feathered or worse. Unlike other stinkers which you can make fun of like ohh say Battleflied: Earth, Dungeon &amp; Dragons or the remake of The Huauting you can't even make fun of the damn thing it takes itself too damn serouisly for it's own good. I once saw this trash compared to John Carpenter's The Thing and all I have to say is &quot;How dare he?&quot; Do yourself a favor and rent a good movie like &quot;Clerks&quot;, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; or &quot;Forest Gump&quot;. It was hard to find a movie to top my worst film ever but thanks to you bastards Brad Pitt and Fincher you've done it. Thanks for taking 2 hours of my life I can't get back. Hollywood scum.
B000003N7G|5.0|I would have to say that A Love Supreme is the greatest work that coltrane ever recorded in the 60's. It's making a move towards true spirituality. He's speaking to your soul. This is a must record for anybody! Period.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This album is psychedelic, satirical, sentimental, combining hard rock tracks (&quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; and Beck's &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;) with whimsical medleys of soft rock standards like &quot;Your Song&quot; and &quot;Roxanne.&quot; Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman add their fabulous (really!) vocals to this unpredictable and unforgettable soundtrack. The single &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; will stick in your head forever, but not in a bad way. Kidman's rendition of &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; (mixed with &quot;Material Girl&quot; no less) sparkles. Some the the most enjoyable tracks are the strangest, like &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot; or &quot;Nature Boy&quot; (dig the David Bowie contribution to the album). Like the movie, this album surprises, and for some it might seem too much, but in this reviewer's opinion, it's the best soundtrack to come out this year.
B000003TA4|3.0|OK...strange is not the word i would choose to describe this album, but the way i feel about it. Whilst this collection of songs is undoubtably one of the most influential and most highly thought of albums of the 90's...something's just not working.<br />Although i do enjoy listening to this album, and often find myself slipping it into my CD player, i really don't know why. The majority of songs are, ultimately, quite average, in particular Drain You, Stay Away and Lounge Act. <br />However, I can't deny that i love Come As You Are's mellow tunefulness and Kurt's Beavis and Butthead voice ('soooooooaaaaaakkkkkkked in bleach' haha). Smells Like Teen Spirit perfectly captured the grunge feeling of the time, yet commercialised it just enough to open it up to the masses, whether that was a good thing or a bad thing. I also like On A Plain for some reason.<br />Overall, whilst this is a good album to have, i wouldn't say it is as amazing as most people seem to think. Maybe at the time, early nineties and all that, it worked, because it was vaguely new, refreshing and different. But 10 years later its just not happening for me.<br />I mean look at the opening lyrics to In Utero...'teenage angst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old...'. Says it all really.<br />OK i'm rambling as usual. Anyway don't listen to me, listen to the sound clips and make up your own mind.
B00003CXN4|4.0|This flic covered both sides of the drug &quot;war&quot; without bias. The characters were believable, and the actors who portrayed them made you care about what happened to them.<BR>The only thing I didn't like was the accasionally ameteurish-looking photography of the film. Some scenes were slightly out of focus, or it seems as if the camera was strapped to the head of a trained seel named Zippo.
0380788624|2.0|This novel starts off as a brilliant exploration of determinism and randomness. The characters bounce from one part of the 2nd World War to another, often with little idea as to why they've been told to do the things they've been ordered to do. The whole aura of the writing is distinctly Pynchonesque, although with not as much satire.<BR>But, by the end of the 1st half of the book, Stephenson's origins as a thriller writer really start to come to the fore. It seems that he can't help but put in a rather cheesy plotline about treasure-finding. A disappointment after such high hopes.
B00003CX8J|3.0|This movie is awesome!
B00003CXHJ|3.0|Okay, let's get the other people's nitpicks out of the way before adding my own:<br />Yes, the writers should not have had the American heroes capture an Enigma machine, since we all know the British did.  They should have named it something else -- or had that part of the mission fail; a good war movie is the getting back alive, you don't have to win the whole war singlehanded.  But the Enigma machine is only a McGuffin here, get over it.<br />Bill Paxton wooden?  On the contrary, I thought his performance was the most believable; talk to a real ship captain sometime.<br />Not &quot;Das Boot?&quot;  No, it ain't.  But it's not trying to be.  It's just trying to be a historical swashbuckler.  If we still made twenty war movies a year, it would be more obvious that there are subgenres, from &quot;war is hell&quot; serious movies like &quot;Das Boot&quot; to adventures in a war setting like the &quot;Guns of Navarone&quot; or &quot;U-571.&quot;<br />I didn't notice any screamingly obvious submarine tech errors -- but then, maybe I wouldn't.  In a swashbuckler, the credibility level doesn't have to be quite so high, anyway.  The two things that kept this movie from getting above 3.5 stars in my book are:<br />A. Somehow it does fail to get us very involved with the characters.  The character writing is skimpy, the acting doesn't grab.  Our hero is given one (schematic, all-spelled-out) inner conflict to deal with, and that's all there is to him.  Harvey Keitel (whom I always consider overrated, but who occasionally proves me wrong, as here), manages to register his character as a human, but nothing comes of it.  T.C. Carson plays his part well, but the way it's written (see B) just hurts the movie.  The plot is involving enough to entertain, but it would have been much better with characters we cared about.<br />B. Okay, I wouldn't nitpick every little technical point, but I hate big fat anachronisms of speech that keep dragging us back to the 1990s or 2000s.  Doesn'tanybody in Hollywood have an ear for how people spoke in the 1940s?  Early on, when our hero calls a stranger &quot;Mack,&quot; I thought, okay, they're making an effort.  But immediately afterward, there's a macho confrontation ending &quot;If you have a problem, talk to X&quot;--sorry, in the '40s this hadn't yet gotten shortened down from &quot;If you have a problem with that,&quot; and even the long version wasn't the most likely way you'd say it.  &quot;If you have a beef with me&quot; is only one of a dozen more authentic ways they could have written it, if they'd just gotten their speech into period.  It gets worse.  I swear I heard someone yell &quot;Incoming&quot; at one point -- Viet Nam, yes, World War II, no.  And the cliche &quot;lock and load&quot; as the big finish to a boarding party peptalk!  The phrase was &quot;load and lock&quot; during World War II, and it was a practical reminder to people loading M1 Garands, not the Tommy guns used here -- it wasn't an all-purpose American version of &quot;Banzai;&quot; using it that way, as they do here, drags us out of our '40s sub and into some '90s corporate boardroom. <br />And finally, there are the awful lines given to the black ship's steward, played by T.C. Carson.  Now, again, this is just meant to be an audience-pleasing swashbuckler, and no audience wants to wallow in the worst aspects of the old segregated armed forces.  We'd all rather see a black steward getting his chance to be a real fighting sailor due to an emergency -- and there's no reason why it couldn't have happened; no doubt it sometimes did.  So why ruin it by making it unbelievable? -- by giving the steward, from the earliest scenes of the picture, a free-and-easy '90s outspokenness with the officers that even white enlisted men wouldn't have attempted in those days?  It kills the character's credibility, making him as much of a drag, in a way, as a completely subservient steward staying in &quot;his place&quot; all the time would have been.<br />Sometimes a good plot requires bending the crediblity of technical details -- but you can *always* get the language right, it costs nothing!  Watch a few dozen old movies for the slang, read five or six of the scores of good novels written by real '40s submariners, develop an ear.  For a writer dealing with '40s characters, these should be the basics, the minimum.  Nobody made an effort here.  Okay, a lot of the contemporary audience has absolutely no feel for the past, and would consider my nitpicks the pickiest and most pointless of all; I understand, that's why I'd go as high as 3 1/2 stars.  <BR>Personally, I think a historical thriller is much more fun if it really feels like the past, and not like a bunch of our immediate contemporaries dressed up in funny clothes.  <br />Anyway, the DVD looks great, sounds great, the story is exciting; don't take it too seriously, and you'll have a good time.  But it wouldn't have been hard to make it a lot better.
0767818040|5.0|A very ingenious, slick, sexy, movie with an unusual plot and a lot of unexpected twists.  Definitely a movie you'll remember.  I have yet to show it to someone who didn't think it was an outstanding movie.
0060922583|5.0|This amazing theory is explained in easy to understand terms. Very thought provoking and certainly made me take a new look at my concepts of reality. The theory of a holographic universe is backed up by years of scientific study and truly facinating. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind seeking explanations about the complex and strange world we live in.
B000050XEI|5.0|I rented the movie, &quot;Sweet November&quot; at the suggestion of a friend and loved it.  One of the reasons the movie touched me was because of Enya's song, &quot;Only Time.&quot;  The next thing I knew I was searching for THIS SONG--I had to have it!!  Ultimately, it was a choice between this CD and the soundtrack to &quot;Sweet November.&quot;  I am so glad I made the right choice!!  This CD is my first exposure to Enya's music, but I can guarantee it will not be my last!!  It is hauntingly, beautifully, familiar and I am loving every note of it!!
B000002B82|5.0|Some of Ozzy's best work - absolutely wonderful CD. Title track is my favorite but all other songs are great. Give a listen to the samples here and see if you don't agree.
006109594X|2.0|Leaving aside the stock characters and the childishly simplistic politics, since these are pretty much standard for the genre, the big problem here is that there is no compelling forward movement to this story: It's a series of set pieces, starting with irrelevant activity aboard an aircraft carrier (irrelevant because the carrier soon vanishes) and including episodes in an Iranian navy yard and the Bosporus straits that could easily have come from entirely different books. The main character jets around the world a lot in an effort to make this all cohere; the narrative logic, though, is less that of a thriller than of a detective story, yet without the thing that gives a detective story its urgency: the need to prove a case. (As this book takes pains to make clear, the US military can inflict &quot;justice&quot; upon whomever it wants without proving anything, and even without having identified the right culprit; so why spend hundreds of pages detailing its evidence-gathering efforts?) The one and only potentially interesting female character appears for a grand total of about 5 pages, and while, again, I expect novels like this to be male-dominated, the author loses a chance here to add an element that would interest even (or especially) his mostly male readership.
6305622930|5.0|While a little skeptical about improving this classic, I am now a believer. This DVD is a tremendous reproduction of the original film!  While some reviews of the sound quality have been critical, I have found that using component video inputs on my 36&quot; SONY Wega with my Onkyo Evision system yielded great results.  Conversion of  the 1970 audio into the Dobly Digital 5.1 is not an easy trick.  The surround effects are simply spectacular!!  Matched with the clean film transfer of this feature, my VHS copy will just never do for the future. The audio dimensions and crisp video are better than I have ever seen this film.  Technically, this 'thirtysomething' year old feature most definitely has new life.<br />  The story of war and General George S. Patton is as fresh and relevant as the day this feature was released.  While the cinematography is certainly grand, there are some anachronisms that I find are easily forgiven given the epic proportions of this movie.  As a professional pyrotechnician, the effects in Patton are well done and true to the grand scale of this milestone feature. Young and old patriots alike will continue to enjoy this picture and the superb acting from a master like George C. Scott.
6302821681|4.0|I shall rate each individual cartoon for you so that you know what you're purchasing.<br />Each Dawn I Crow: A<br />Very Hitchcock-like cartoon with Elmer Fudd in a supporting role.<br />Pests for Guests: A<br />Elmer deals with those two overly polite gophers.<br />Upswept Hare: A-<br />A Bugs and Elmer cartoon. It's not their greatset but it is still enjoyable.<br />Don't Axe Me: C-<br />Elmer Fudd's wife is a nice touch. However, the slow 50's sitcom pace ruins what could have been a funny cartoon. By the way, this cartoon is sort of Elmer Fudd's swansong. The man who did his voice died after this was made.<br />Robot Rabbit: A<br />A very good Bugs vs Elmer to end this collection.
B00005K3O4|4.0|when i first saw this movie when i was 8 i knew that it would be a movie i would watch forever. any true horror movie lover would like to see this original movie from 1988!
0812550706|5.0|This book was reccomended to me by a close friend of mine and highly trusted personal book critic.  Upon finishing several chapters of the book, every bit of possitive commontary she supplied me with was confirmed.  What an excellent read!  The twists and turns of this pathos-inspiring novel keep one interested, and the well developed characters hardly seem works of fiction.  The action and suspense picks up immediately in the first chapter.  Words of advice: Do not read if you need sleep, for you will not be able to put this one down!
B00003CXA2|5.0|You never know what you're gonna get!<br />Forrest Gump is without a doubt one of the best films of the 1990s.  Very unique, very original, very wonderful!  And now with the release of this gem onto DVD, you get even more to write home to Momma about.  <br />2 Audio Commentaries - The first with Director Robert Zemeckis, Producer Steve Starkey and Production Designer Rick Carter is a nice mix of storytelling, special effects talk, and personal memories, while the second commentary by Producer Wendy Finerman is a more intimate setting (since she's alone), giving cute stories such as the reason why the speakers are cut off while Forrest is speaking in Washington D.C. is because no one could think of anything profound enough for him to say for real.  <br />Through The Eyes of Forrest Gump - This 30 minute documentary is one of the most famous, in that it was sold separately on video in stores all over the country...and sold well.  On the laserdisc of Forrest Gump it was included as a bonus on side 4.  So many wonderful moments from the film are discussed, including how they were able to have Tom Hanks shake hands and interact with JFK, turning Tom into a ping pong wizard, as well as making Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan) believably look as if he truly lost his legs.  This is certainly not your run of the mill &quot;making of&quot; that gets boring after a few minutes.  It instead holds your interest to the point where you're saying &quot;WOW!!  So that's how they did it!&quot;  My only complaint is that the transfer of this documentary didn't seem crisp and sharp enough.  It almost seemed like they just copied it off of a laserdisc.  I happen to own the laserdisc, so I compared the two and to me, the laser looked brighter and sharper.  But it's a minor complaint.  The film itself looks great!<br />The Magic of Makeup - A wonderful look at how the makeup in this film was so crucial to its success.  Included is makeup for Tom Hanks, Robin Wright Penn, Gary Sinise and Sally Field.Tom's beard growing is interesting, but watching Sally Field being transformed into an elderly woman is astonishing!<br />Through The Ears of Forrest Gump - This is the sort of thing most moviegoers take for granted...the sound of a film.  When you watch this segment you'll get a sense of just how important sound was in making scenes come alive: the sound of the bikes rolling after a young Forrest as he breaks free of his metal braces, the tracers and mortar explosions during the Vietnam sequence, creating different ways to convey the sound of the rain in Vietnam as Forrest had said rained in so many different ways, the storm at sea, and much more!  <br />Building The World of Gump - Creating the places and settings of the film, including Forrest's home in Alabama, Vietnam, and Washington D.C.  All crucial to the films believability. <br />Seeing Is Believing - 11 visual effects from the film are discussed, including 2 that didn't make the final cut.  Forrest was planned to meet Martin Luther King, Jr., a scene involving dogs being released to stop what Forrest thought was a &quot;parade&quot; of black Americans, headed by King.  But because Forrest knew all the dogs since they were puppies, he unknowingly stops the violence by getting their attention with a stick, then apologizes to Mr. King, himself (&quot;They're just dogs&quot;) - The other new scene is a ping pong match with George Bush Sr when he was the Ambassador to China and having Forrest hit him in the crotch with the ball.  Both of these scenes are winners to me, but I'm sure they may have bogged down the story some, and that's why they were cut.  Nice to have them here though.<br />Photo Gallery - Some nice still shots of the film that are definitely worth looking at.<br />Screen Tests - A total of 7, the first 3 with Michael Conner Humphrey (Young Forrest) and Hanna R. Hall (Young Jenny), 2 with Robin Wright Penn (Jenny), and 2 with Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Gump Jr.).  Besides witnessing these characters coming to life for the first time through the actors, it's also interesting to see Tom Hanks before he employed Micheal Humphrey's accent to his own and how this made a huge difference.<br />2 Theatrical Trailers - including the &quot;Remember...&quot; trailer, which contains no dialogue and just uses Alan Silvestri's wonderful score.<br />Get the film that gave Tom Hanks his second consecutive Oscar on DVD in a nice two disc set.  Relive the magic and the memories.  Relive Forrest Gump.<br />&quot;And that's all I have to say about that&quot;. - Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump

0446608955|4.0|This is pure schmaltz, a genuine tear-jerker written for impressionable young teenagers to outline a more serious approach to love than the usual &quot;let's hit the sack and have some fun&quot; approach.<br /> The story isn't nearly as good as &quot;Love Story&quot; by Eric Segal, but that's a minor quibble.  Segal dealt with college students;  Sparks has written a book that relates to high school and junior high students who have not yet begun to date seriously.  The theme of the book is very simple:  true love is based on the content of a person's character, not on chest size or the willingness to engage in sex play.<br /> It's a favorite theme of Sparks, the idea of an enduring love that overcomes and outlasts all obstacles and setbacks.  He used it well in &quot;Message in a Bottle,&quot; dealing with two middle-aged adults who are old enough to have sex.  In this book, it's two kids who  barely hold hands and share only a few chaste kisses, which makes it clearly designed and suitable for the teen and pre-teen audience.  Any normal teen will appreciate it;  and parents can feel safe the book is as tame as a Donald Duck cartoon..<br /> One brief excerpt, near the end, nicely sums up the whole approach:  &quot;We kissed again, too, though not every time we were together, and I didn't even think of trying to make it to second base.  There wasn't any need to.  There was something nice when I kissed her, something gentle and right, and that was enough for me.  The more I did it, the more I realized that Jamie had been misunderstood her entire life, not only by me, but by everyone.&quot;<br /> Think of the movie &quot;Titanic&quot; without any hint of sex or nudity, and you have this book in a nutshell.  &quot;Titanic&quot; made millions of innocent young girls weep copious tears for a love that was snuffed out by the disaster to the ship;  &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; will appeal to the same girls who want such a love to come into their lives.<br /> If you're a parent of a teen child, buy this book.  Read it yourself, it deals with a fate and feelings that many adults carry through their entire lives.  It is a warm reminiscence of a long lost love that might have been, and it tugs on those adult heartstrings.<br /> Then let your kids have it, it relates to them on their level and it is one of the best introductions you'll find to the meaning of love in contrast to the shallow sensual emphasis that dominates so much of today's movies and novels.  Kids who read it will grow into mature sensitive adults with an ability to understand that true love involves more than chest sizes and hot pants;  it will help them become true adults instead of perpetual teenagers.arent of a teen child, buy this book.

B000003TAW|5.0|Ok, how can i describe this album to you, pure bliss, would be one way to put it, songs like the Sweater Song and Buddy Holly got us into these guys, but its songs like Say it aint so, In my garage, and Holiday that keeps us listening, and basically the whole album is that great, and  Weezer may be one of the best bands to emerge out of the 90's cause they basically opened doors for everyone from Green Day to Blink 182, by basically showing rock can positive but yet creative and wonderful, and Weezer on this album accomplishes this.
0792140346|5.0|As the first big role I had seen Edward Norton in, I was amazed.  Norton became a favorite actor of mine after seeing American History X (Norton, Edward Furlong).  His ability to get into a role and convince you that he is not an actor at all but actually the character he plays is uncanny.<BR>   Richard Gere graced the screen once again in a wonderfully written script which kept you guessing and intrigued you for every second of the movie.  Gere and Norton were a winning combination, playing off of each other as if they had been working together forever.<BR>   The script was amazing, the acting was amazing, and most of all, the movie left you with a hard-hitting feeling that you had to sit down and think for a half an hour just to take in the beauty of it all.<BR>   I recommend this movie 110%.
B00000JG41|5.0|To me Sweet Charity is one of the most beautiful songs I ever heard in my life, but add up the creativity of the rest of the album and you may have one of the greatest rock albums ever, Mr.Bungle may forever be underated for thier unpredictable and oringinal song formats, they just combine almost everything, it amazes how they can effectivily add so many styles of music into one song, but these are amazing songs, yeah they could stick to one genre and make an amazing album of that sound, but they basically include every genre likes its thiers to own, so what more can i say, this is definetly one of the great albums of the 20th century, enjoy.
B00005JHAB|4.0|.... It seemed simply typical: Two people are set to be married, the star of the movie falls in love with one of them, the engaged person falls in love with the star, the engaged person leaves their significant other for the star, and they live happily ever after. For this reason, I avoided seeing the movie for some time. I now regret not seeing it in the theater with my girlfriend. The movie provided the viewer with enough twists and turns to keep them interested and Jennifer Lopez worked magic in making you fall in love with her. It made for a great date movie and one worth seeing even if you weren`t on a date.<BR>This wasn`t a thought-provoking Drama or a action-packed Thriller, but if you are in the mood for a romantic film without the need of alot of thought, it is definitely worth watching. In the Romance genre, it followed in the footsteps of Pretty Woman in making you feel good, which should be the goal of any Romance. It was an unexpected delight and I recommend seeing it.
B000005ALP|4.0|Basically put this is one creative album, I heard so many genres of music on this one album, you just have to leave with respect for this just for the oringinality, a must buy for anyone who likes good music with some unpredictabilty.

6304595247|5.0|I remember seeing a professional review of this movie saying it was &quot;To Dark&quot;..Obviously the review never read the book. It is one of the darkest love stories every told and glossing it over, as in the Hollywood versions, doesn't do it justice. The look of this movie is perfect and totally believable. I assume that those who find it problematic haven't taken a look at what is happening in the world lately. The affects that evironment and lack of love can have on a child can be profound. In Heathcliff we see a child, taken from the streets, given a home, but not without the taunting of an older, &quot;brother&quot; and the care he receives only last until his adoptive father dies. Then he is treated as the lowest of servants. Is this so unrealistic that we cannot see &quot;Heathcliffs&quot; amoung us today!What we see is a man, full of hate and anger, but DESPERATELY clinging to the one person that gave him happeness, even after her death. (PLEASE MAKE IT INTO A DVD)
B000059XUI|3.0|I'm a big fan of director Richard Lester's work. There's an element of satire and black humor in the majority of his films that make them truly special (he's the only director other than Kubrick that I could have pictured working with Terry Southern on Dr. Strangelove). Nevertheless when I first heard about this being released in 1981 I was a bit surprised that Lester was the director.<br />Despite his considerable talents the Superman films are very much beyond his talent. Original director Richard Donner recognized the most important element in making the first film work; buying the story hook, line and sinker without making fun of the comic book genre. That's not to say that Donner's film didn't have it's comic elements; it worked well on both levels which is something that can't be said for any of the films that followed.<br />Superman 2 has its moments and the best of them are in the scenes directed by Donner and retained for the original release. Certainly Lester did a competent job of putting the final film all together but the uneven tone and the gaps in the narrative prevent Superman 2 from surpassing the first film. Certainly Superman had its flaws; the whole sequence with Lois Lane's inept poem should have been cut or at least trimmed in the original film. It goes on too long. The same can be said for some of the more comic scenes that Lester introduces to this chapter of the Superman saga.<br />Superman 2 isn't a disappointment just an underachiever. The original script had much promise. It's a pity that Warner chose not to research the deleted sequences (many of which appeared in the television premiere)and adding them to this film. These scens brought considerable depth and improved an already shakey production. It's also a pity that Warner chose not to let Donner go back and take the sequences he completed putting them on a second disc (or layer) for comparison to the finished final version Lester put together.<br />The footage reportedly still exists and with a bit of research Warner could easily put the material back together. My guess is that it has more to do with legal issues (something that has prevented Warner from doing the right thing before--such as releasing the final three Badfinger albums on CD in the US). A pity as this film would benefit from the TLC shown the first film. Maybe some upstart like Anchor and Bay can license it from Warner and do this fine but underperforming sequel the justice it deserves.ts and with a bit of research Warner could easily put the material back together.

0385484518|4.0|BOY did I have trouble rating this one. Relatives strongly suggested I read this book. It was (and is) on all of the best-seller lists. It has been a t.v. movie. It has been hailed as the kind of book that makes you pause and appreciate life -- a tool for a new spiritual awakening in many. It's one of these books that if you read it and don't like it people think you're out of it, or don't care or move your lips when you read. It is well-written and a quick read. I have to admit that during the first part of the book I was fascinated and deeply touched by story of the dying Morrie and his loyal former student and dear friend. Both teacher and student/author were folks I would have liked to have known and I admired them. And as the saga progresssed I became more involved. But the end of this book was very unsatisfying. It isn't that Morrie died (I sort of think that was not precisely a surprise...) but somewhere along the line this book seems to shift from a true, genuine testimonial to a wonderful man and teacher to a writing project concluded with a touch of triteness. In the end, I felt I had read something that manipulated my emotions, made me care, made me care partly because I knew OTHERS who read it cared... but didn't live up to it's beginning and middle in the end. True, it may take you on part of a spiritual journey...but towards the end it veers off course.
0783240236|4.0|I loved The Birds as a kid. The film is pretty frightening stuff and is one of the few films of Hitch's that crosses the line from thriller to horror (along with the much maligned but terrific little film Frenzy made with Anthony Schaffer of Sleuth fame. The effects, script and eerie &quot;score&quot; by Bernard Herrmann make this a late period classic from Hitch.<br />The script is a bit uneven and the performance of Tippi Hendren can generously be called &quot;wooden&quot;. Rod Taylor gives a nice, complex performance that enhances the film. All the performances with the exception of Hendren's are stellar. It's not that she's necessarily bad she just doesn't fit in the Hitchcock universe despite all of the appearences to the contrary.<br />Nevertheless the film benefits from a number of powerful set pieces including the sequence where Hendren is trapped in a telephone booth. The first major assault by the birds is effective and frightening. The effects work by Albert Whitlock given the time the film was made is nothing short of astonishing.<br />With Psycho Hitch seemed to turn a corner in his career. His films took on both a new complexity and venture into territories that he hadn't visited before. Although Hitch would have a few missteps after this film (Marnie, Torn Curtain and the uncertain Topaz)he managed to close out his career with two minor classics with Frenzy and the comical Family Plot.
6304342160|5.0|This movie is a gem.  Had to drive to Chapel Hill from Greensboro, NC in 1996 to see this film when it first 'came out', since GSO wasn't gonna show it and had no intention to!!  Wow - was it worth the gas money and then some!!  What a wonderful movie!  Suspense, sex, love, murder, theft, betrayal... need I go on?  Yes, film noir.  Yes, lesbian sex (and how!)  Yes, Jesse Helms would hate it (but I'd love to make him watch it with his wife!)  RUN to rent or own this film!!  DVD is probably the best bet since you can see the DIRECTOR's commentary, too.  Very interesting.  In any event, this movie is fun to watch, never boring, and who can argue with the star power and chemistry of Joey Pants, Gina Gershon, and the voluptuous Jennifer Tilly?!?!?  Check it out and have some fun!!
B00005JCAA|4.0|There is something about this movie that is difficult to put your finger on.  It gets under your skin.  It's easy to note the beautiful acting of of Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani, and the absolutely phenomenal cinematography and the sublime soundtrack.  But it is more than all of that.  The film says something about life and the value of &quot;sucking the marrow&quot; out of it that makes it irresistible to me.  And the scene where Pitt and Forlani meet for the first time is one of the sweetest caught on film that I've ever seen.
B000051VWW|4.0|Definitely a recommended CD.  The avid fans of Sade have waited years for a release and she has given us a great collection of her life experiences during hiatus.  She has put her heart and soul into each words she sings.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Requiem for a Dream is one of the most POWERFUL films. I have ever seen. I am surprised that this film came out of hollywood. The whole cast proved to me their addiction and their pain. Recommended to ANYONE who wants to see a great movie, or if someone is battling an addiction themselves. You will not be dissapointed.

I dont really like pop anyway, bu this is completely superficial, nonsense lyrics, and very little talent. that said, it could be worse. Mama is almost really good, and the rest are ditzy fun. However, I listened to it so much when i first got it, and ive heard it so often on the radio, that for me its been heard often enough.<BR>Basically, dont buy this unless either<BR>1) you love the Spice Girls<BR>2) Youve never heard any of the songs before<BR>3) You like totally empty, dumb pop<BR>or<BR>4) you are under 10 yrs. old<BR>sorry to all u total fans
B00000634J|4.0|Lennon Legend is the best available compilation of John Lennon's solo career. It has more tracks than the previous 2 attempts to compile a &quot;Best of Lennon&quot;, Shaved Fish and The Collection. The third time, however, is not a charm. The most blatant omission from Fish and Collection, &quot;God&quot; from 1969's Plastic Ono Band, is not included on this compilation as well. How can John's closing the chapter on the Beatles, the 60's and so much else not be included? The omission of &quot;God&quot; may be a blessing in disguise because 1969's Plastic Ono Band album contains no &quot;hits&quot; (although Working Class Hero did make it on to this collection). Therefore, anybody truly interested in Lennon's music must have Plastic Ono Band in his/her collection to hear &quot;God&quot; in it's proper context.
B000002I6T|5.0|This is Crosby at his very best. It is laid back to the horizontal, but is a work that is firmly rooted in its time and place. The guest list reads like a who's who of the counter culture with Jerry Garcia, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young etc. etc. providing the musical backdrop to Crosby's wonderful voice. 'Tamalpais High' and 'Laughing' are highlights, but there really isn't a poor track on the record. Turn it up, lie back and you could be back in the days of festivals, flowers and kaftans! A classic.
B00003CXSP|2.0|I loved &quot;The Scilence of the Lambs&quot;, which was a brilliant film. Much more than I can say for this garbage. It recieves 2 stars, because Anthony Hopkins played Hannibal *decently*, for what crummy script he was given. This movie was just a stupid hollywood ploy, which i got pulled into. The acting is VERY cheesy, as are the lines, as is the STUPID attempt at trying to use shock-value to save an unsaveable movie. It is intensly- and moreover unnecessarily- gruesome and disgusting. I winced at the sight of sickening scenes in that film, and I am not one to look down upon a movie for gore, but I certainly do here. The use of violence was unneceary- and this, folks, is coming from a teenager. Just to give you an idea. It was quite OBVIOUSLY unnecessary, which is really what struck me. Anyways, the plot is poor (almost non-existant), the lines are aweful (i mean truly cheesy and bad) and the use of rediculouse senarios do not make it any better. There were many of these- more than enough to ruin the movie, simply in this catagroy. So, stay away from this junk, it does not deserve to be associated with the original.
B00004XQ83|5.0|See the movie merely to listen to the soundtrack if you aren't willing to buy (which is a mistake in itself). This CD features an awe-inspiring array of bluegrass and folk tunes... wonderful vocalization and great humor.<BR>A MUST BUY!
B00005MAM2|5.0|What can I say about this movie? One thing is for sure, it's not for casual watching. Every single sentence in this movie is important, you have to pay complete attention to understand it, and even then you wont understand it first time. The first time I watched it, I had no idea what it all meant, but it was still hauntingly beautiful. It left me with curiousity, I watched again and understood a little more. I asked questions and watched another time, and it took three viewings of this movie for it all to come together. This movie has enough plots for 5 movies, it's an amazing film animated or otherwise. If you want questions answered go to a search engine and type in &quot;akira FAQ&quot; It might help out a bit.<br />The music in this movie is so unique, it's a blend between ethnic and futuristic, but it really fits the mood of the movie. This has to be one of my top 10 movies because everything in this movie has a reason. It may not seem that way upon first viewing. But keep watching it comes all together.<br /> Example: Tetsuo has a dream about him and Kaneda playing when they're young. He sees the building in front of him collapse, and then he himself physically collapses, but Kaneda isn't harmed.<br />This wasn't stuck in the movie just to capture the attention of the viewers. The meaning of the dream is that Tetsuo would destroy the city, and then himself, but his love for Kaneda would keep Kaneda alive. This is one example of hidden meanings lying within this movie.<br />As for the dub, yes the first dub was better, but even if it was on the dvd. I'd still choose the Japanese, it honestly does the best job of portraying the characters emotions. So don't complain about the dub, watch the Japanese, it's better then both. <br />The animation is top notch, and it is very vivid. It amazes me to think this film was made in 1988. <br />Akira will frustrate those who are not willing to spend some time thinking about a movie. But for the rest of us, it's a film we can actually think about, it's not a movie that shoves everything in your face, you will come to your own conclusions, and that's what makes it so beautiful.
B00005JY1B|1.0|This is a remake of the 60's movie.  It's the story of a man (Keanu Reeves) who's absorbed in his work.  He's obsessed with it.  While at the DMV, he meets a quirky, high spirited girl named Sara (played by Charlize Theron). She offers him the opportunity of devoting herself to him for the month of November if he will give up work (he's already lost his job, so why is this an issue anyway?) so she can &quot;show him life as it should be lived.&quot;  It's supposed to be a platonic relationship, but of course, they sleep together after spending only hours together.  So, after some mild resisting, he accepts the challenge and we see how he changes his ideals during that month.  <BR>Now, I don't know about anyone else, but I don't always have to see absolute reality in movies.  They *are* movies.  However, this was SO far fetched that even I couldn't believe this man wouldn't call the police and have her locked up for stalking after their second meeting.  And to have him change his values after a matter of about 2 weeks into this experiment just made me shake my head in disbelief.  There are some touching scenes and I liked the sub-story of his involvement with the neighbor boy who he becomes sort of a father figure to.  There were also some amusing scenes involving the cross-dressing neighbors.  But on the whole the story was just too preposterous to find entertaining at all.  The ending is meant to tear at your heart strings but it just didn't work for me.  Sad?  Yes.  Good?  No. If you must see it, wait for it to be on cable.

B00005O3VC|5.0|This is a very good movie, if your in for a lot of laughs. Right from the start you start to laugh out of control. He really knows how to put humor in english history. This movie is great for a slumber party. It has a few bloody scenes, but they're humorous. For example, at one fight scene to cross the bridge, he had to fight a knight who was blocking the bridge. So he chopped of one arm, then he slices off the other arm. The knight then starts to kick him so he slices off one leg, then the other. Finally as he is walking away with victory the knight says, &quot;Come back here, I can still bite you.&quot; How Monty Python puts the most disgusting things into funny things is just one of a kind. Then there's the deal with the knights who say niph. You just have to see this movie!! I was thirteen when I saw it, because my world history showed it to us on the last few days of school! It is the best!

In oposition to the first one, this CD grows as it aproaches the end. The first 3-4 songs funtion as an introduction and you almostn't notice when passing one to another. Then you have chineese food inspired &quot;Chop Suey&quot;, &quot;Forest&quot;, the one and great &quot;ATWA&quot; that will stay for long, &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;Toxicity&quot; another excelent song between great ones, &quot;Psycho&quot; groupie cocaine crazy, and &quot;Aerials&quot; that incredibily suites some violins (!!!). The songs are for me very alike &quot;spiders&quot; of the first album, with great melodic, beautiful and talented parts among the most powerful ones.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Everything has been said about this movie, so I won't add my comments, having had them said by others with more eloquence, perhaps, than I.<br />I think of this every time I hear the title &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;...Orson Welles's dying words, I believe to Peter Bogdanovich, were, &quot;Don't let Ted Turner gets his crayons on Citizen Kane....&quot;<br />And this...my persoanl favorite scenes are the great picnic scene on the beach with the music and the tents and all those black limousines, more suited to a funeral; and the scene of the wife, the Marion Davies character, sitting on the floor in front of a fireplace big enough to roast a rhinoceros, should one want to do such a thing, and doing yet another jigsaw puzzle and complaining that they never did anything or went anywhere...this, in a room of cavernous proportions, another reference to the fact that even San Simeon is not a guarantee of domestic bliss. (Although in life, they did give a few Hollywood parties...) It was after the fireplace scene that the beach picnic took place, Kane's concession to his wife's boredom and loneliness.

0140177396|4.0|Steinbeck is one of my favorite American authors, I've read most of his novels.  I hadn't read this book since 10th grade, so I bought a new copy and read it again.  I like the imagery and characterizations.  It's a good story, plus it is a good book to read when you want to read \\"literature\\" but are intimidated by the 800-page Russian or British books. (Or likewise, Grapes of Wrath)  The major problem I have with this book and much of Steinbeck's works are that the majority of women are portrayed as [prostitutes] who let their sexuality cause evil.  Even on the back of this novel, it says something like \\"George protected innocent Lenny until a flirtacious woman...\\"  I'm just tired of Steinbeck's view of women as evil sexual temptresses (East of Eden, Wayward Bus) or [prostitutes] (Cannery Row, Sweet Thursday)... definately worth reading though.

0684800713|5.0|Still, I'll have a go.<br />THE SUN ALSO RISES was Hemingway's breakthrough novel. And what a breakthough it was. Before it, he had modest success with his short stories (a literary form of which he was a master, to be sure). But it was this novel that made his reputation stateside (he was an expatriate in Paris, just like the characters in this novel, at the time he wrote and published it).<br />The book reads like a prolonged short story which is, in fact, its great strength. It is a slice of life, of very particular lives to be sure, painted in that finely crafted impressionist style which Hemingway honed in his days as a literary apprentice in Kansas City, Chicago and on the Left Bank of post World War I Paris. Briefly, the book details the escapades of a group of expatriates living it up in dissolute pleasure in the wake of the recently finished war in a recovering and still giddy Europe. Giddy, at least, within the crowded milieu in which these people mainly move. It has no plot to speak of, except for the movement of its people in and out of bars, parties and bull fights, and their conversations in cafes and taxis and, on occasion,in rural hunting lodges, most of which embody a tight and elaborate dance of almost ritual posturing. The tale follows them as they move cautiously about one another, and through various parts of Europe from their Parisian base, seeking connection and a tenuous spiritual sustenance which may only be had in the hurly-burly of a nightlife world of their own making, a world in which past troubles and insecurities can momentarily be forgotten. At its heart the novel follows, most of all, the growth of one man, its main character, from morose outsider in love with the unattainable to a person who sees his world all too clearly and, recognizing this, severs himself at the end from what he most desires. Nothing happens and yet everything does, precisely reflecting the emotional landscape through which the tale progresses.<br />I will add my voice to some others here, as well, regarding the inimitable Hemingway style, a style he fashioned (not entirely in a vacuum, of course) from the world of experimentalist writers and painters in which he immersed himself in his Paris years. At its best, the sort of writing with which he has crafted this fascinating novel explodes into the reader's consciousness, creating a sense of reality and freshness that previous forms of prose had failed to attain. It is poetry as much as prose for its rhythms and repetitive stress on simple, basic words which combine, at times, to build an image in the mind, a concrete sense of the real world which puts to shame all the abstractions and florid prose of previous literary works.<br />But there's no sense in trying to recapitulate the story here or to describe how it's told. The best thing is for the reader to step into it and experience it. It is still fresh and strong today and worth your time.y voice to some others here, as well, regarding the inimitable Hemingway style, a style he fashioned (not entirely in a vacuum, of course) from the world of experimentalist writers and painters in which he immersed himself in his Paris years.

B0000524CY|4.0|The Exorcist has to be one of the scariest movies ever made. <br />Contradictory to what the title suggests, the scariest part is not the exorcism but the lead-up to Regan being acknowledged by the church as possessed. <BR>The lack of incidental music throughout the movie ensures that there is absolutely no guidance leading up to the scares as usually happens with other scary movies. This elevates the surprise factor and makes the whole experience nerve-wracking and terrifying. <BR>The scariest part by far (and I still get goose pimples thinking about it now) is the dream sequence where father Karras dreams about his mother coming up the subway stairs (New York subway equals hell, gettit?)with sounds of children playing and the face of the devil flashing before you. It is nothing short of genius and it is absolutely bone-chilling (what black and red make-up can do!). It illustrates that the demon's reach knows no bounds. The medallion falling (the one Merrin found in Irak near the head of pazuzu) and the arabic clock stopping (part of the first scenes in Irak with Merrin)tells us that the demon is trying to draw him into his schemes. Something that we know at that moment but to Karras it is confirmation of guilt (abandoning his dying mother). A perfect illustration of evil. <br />It is a must see for everyone who enjoys supernatural horror movies but it is definately not for the fainthearted or the very young. I for one was absolutely convinced that I was going to be possessed by the devil when I first read the book at 13 years old :-). The added scenes in this version however really add very little to the orignal version. The spider walk is scary and is a good addition. I still have to see the documentary and I think it is a shame that it is not on this version.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane maybe my favorite film. It's hard to say. I read through all the reveiws and I agree with the people who say that many people cant enjoy it cause it's so huge. It was a turning point in movies. I really dont care what those idiots who say that this movie is bad just because they beleive it doesnt live up to all it's supposed to be. It is still an excellant film. I've benn watching classic movies like Casablanca, Gone With the Wind and the Godfather since I was 10 so I consider myself a bit of a film critic, (even if I am 14,) and I can say that this is, without out the hype, and documentries made about it, and all the critical aclaim, a really excellant touching movie about a man who wants all to love him buy moves farther away from those around him as he ages. Some people say that it has too many flashbacks and is too confusing, (like the guy who wrote the reveiw that is a few slots under mine,) in my humble opinion these are the kind of people who have no pateince at all. People who want a movie to be as easy to understand as it could be. But the truth is, the best movies are ment to be figured out and thought about. Despit all the nay sayers who say that this movie wasnt as revolutionary as many say it is and those who just dont understand it, it is a wonderful, excellant movie. If you can just sit and watch this movie without thinking of the naysayers and critics, I think you could really love it. So what if it wasnt the most innovative film ever. It is still very worth your money.
B00004C8TC|5.0|Radu Lupu, the famously reclusive virtuoso, gives thrilling perfomances of these two concertos, so often paired on LP and CD. The only other recording that comes close is Kristian Zimerman with von Karajan on DG; sonically, it is marginally superior, and Zimerman's flawless technical skill and emotional intensity are beyond reproach. But there's something almost indefinable about Lupu's playing, a sort of barely-controlled passion, that puts his recording in a class by itself. Like Zimerman, he negotiates the most difficult passages with ease, not only hitting the right notes, but giving them just enough of a new interpretation to make you sit up and take notice.<br />But he goes further, playing familiar phrases and entire passages so that the listener hears the notes more clearly than usual, and he doesn't just do this during the big, dramatic moments. It's more than just engineering or recording balances: Lupu plays the notes with a strength that you can hear, while never seeming to hammer them out. Perhaps it's this combination of powerful playing and extreme sensitivity to the music itself that makes his performances so memorable. Whatever the case, this is a recording you can listen to over and over, each time discovering something you had not heard before, and each time marveling at the sheer beauty of the playing.
630575067X|3.0|I found that this movie had all the action that one would come to expect of a Star Wars movie.Character developement was not bad either.The only character I had a problem with was that of Anakin-played by Jake Lloyd. I found this character to be quite annoying at times. I could not tell if it was Jake Lloyd's inability to act or if it was an incredibly bad script for him.Overall the movie is very entertaining and children will love it.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie lines up with Citisen Kane The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the wind witch where awarded the best movies of all time this movie goes right up there with it, Witch the MOVIE is about a guy who gos crazy and his family basicly spliting up and his daughter who falls in love with the boy next door. NOTICE SPOILER The guy ends up geting killed at the end, witch you will turn off the movie saying that it was probly one of the weridest movie you have  ever seen but after you watch it a 2nd time you will relize the meaning of the movie and in my opinon this was the greatest movie ever made in the last 8 years.
0062502182|5.0|&quot;The Alchemist,&quot; is an excellent, well-written book with intuitive and interesting thoughts on life, love and dreams. The story follows Santiago, a shepherd boy who has a dream about traveling to the Egyptian pyramids. He goes to a psychic to analyze his dream. She tells him that if he travels to the pyramids, he will find a treasure and fulfill his destiny. So, Santiago goes on his way, selling his herd, working odd jobs and encountering strange and fascinating people along the way. Several years later, he reaches his destination and has an epiphany about his life. The story's climax will leave you perplexed and will most likely lead you to question your own dreams and destiny. In conclusion, &quot;The Alchemist&quot; is a magnificent tale of self-examination and personal growth that I would highly recommend.
B000057NVH|5.0|When it was released, Tubular Bells brought a lot of critical acclaim to Mike Oldfield.  Virgin Records has recently re-released the album on multichannel SACD.  The results are outstanding.<br />The multichannel SACD mix is presented in 4.0 channel sound (rather than the usual 5.1).  This is because the original multichannel track was developed for 1970s quad.  While usually transfering a quad track to modern multichannel is bad, in this case it works very well.  There is no LFE or center channel included in the recording.<br />There is a very detailed description of the history of Tubular Bells in the CD booklet that accompanies the disc.  The disc also contains the original two track Tubular Bells as an SACD layer and a CD layer.  Interrestingly enough, some of the original Tubular Bells was re-recorded in the 1970s for the multichannel version.  So the stereo and 4.0 mixes truly are different.<br />While I would normally not recommend taking a quad recording and releasing it in any modern format (see Paul McCartney's &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; on DTS CD as an example of what not to do), Tubular Bells sounds fresh and clean.  <br />For those who have not heard the album before, it really defies categorization.  While very &quot;listenable&quot;, it is also very experimental in the use of instrumentation and creating an environment of interesting sounds.  There are only two tracks on the SACD.<br />The SACD is playable on CD and SACD players.  For high definition sound, you'll need an SACD player.  For multichannel high definition sound you'll need a multichannel SACD player, such as Sony's SCD-CE775.<br />Overall this is very enjoyable music that luckily is now available in 4.0 channel surround sound.
B00003CY3W|5.0|I had read Daniel Clowes comic prior to watching the film and I was very much looking forward to it. I was a bit concerned that the movie would be just like the comic(which would be great, of course) and that nothing would surprise me. I couldn't have been more wrong. Clowes and Zwigoff's screenplay was perfect. It incorporated some of the stuff from the comic, but had all these new and interesting expansions(Steve Buscemi's character being a fantastic addition). Thora Birch was excellent and hers is one of the best performances of the year(better than her turn in AMERICAN BEAUTY). All in all a fantastic film and one that will rank among my favorites of recent memory.
6304493681|2.0|I couldn't believe how boring this movie was! Sure, the animation was beautiful, but the story was sleep-inducing. If you like this kind of anime, than go for it. I personally like fantasy a lot better and that may be why I didn't like it.

B00004Z459|5.0|I got the Linkin Park cd for my birthday, and immediatly fell in love with it. The cd starts off with Papercut, a very fast song which catchy lyrics. The next song is the hit One Step Closer, which is despite being short, is very good with some hard and meaningful lyrics. The cd goes on with awesome hard, fast moving songs, and finally gets to track 11,Cure For The Itch, which is just music, without lyrics. Finally the cd closes with great song, Pushing Me Away. The entire album is very clean, without any swearing, which just goes to show you that good music does not always have to have the profanity such as most rap music does.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Dr. Lecter is back and comes out of retirment with a vengence. Clarice is on the case of Hannibal. Hannibal is moved up to the FBI's ten most wanted list.

This is probally the best DVD to date because it has four whole hours of extras which include the making of Hannibal, an interview with Ridley Scott, tons of deleted sceans with and without commentary your choice, an alternate ending, production notes, cast and crew bios, theatrical trailers, and much more.
0061020710|3.0|This is the Big Bang of Terry Pratchett's massive Discworld series. The book that gave birth to the craze.<br />Those who have read the other Discworld books first before reading 'Colour of Magic' may find this book not as funny and the writing not as smooth. That is to be understood. It is the first book after all. <br />Well known characters may also seem different. Death is potrayed as Death should be; dark and sinister. It is a contrast from his later appearances, especially in his own books 'Mort' and 'Reaper Man', where he (it?) is more...well, funnier. Other Discworld regulars also make their first appearances here such as the Patrician and the City Watch officers. Oh, the famous Mended Drum (Ankh Morpork's hippest hangout) is featured as well in the early part of the book...but something happens to it.<br />In fact, something happens to at least half the city. It catches fire. Then it floods. The inept wizard Rincewind swears its not his fault. Nor is it Twoflower's. It just so happens that trouble is attracted to them like pubescent boys are to Britney Spears.<br />Rincewind is a failed wizard with only one spell in his head. A spell so powerful other spells run away. Twoflower is a tourist from a faraway land who wants to see the fabled city of Ankh Morpork. Rincewind has to look after him and make sure he's not hurt by order of the Patrician...or else. Of course this being Rincewind and the world being the Disc, a nice leisurely stroll through the sights and sounds of Ankh Morpock are well nigh impossible. Its more like a gallop. <br />'Colour of Magic' reads like a typical fantasy novel like 'The Hobbit' albeit with more jokes. The reader is roller-coastered from one mishap to the next with a permanent grin on his/her face.<br />And that's all your face will probably make. A grin. Not a chuckle. Nor a guffaw. Read the other Discworld books if you want to laugh out loud. Especially the ones that feature Death or the City Watch. Saying that though, 'Colourof Magic' is still a good book from the fertile mind of Terry Pratchett. After all, if it wasnt good enough there wouldn't be a Discworld series.<br />3 stars.

0345442989|5.0|In short, this book was great. It provides an excellent story line and background for what happens in Episode I. When the Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter came out I thought that book would be the one to help answer the questions to Episode I, but as it turns out it was just a fun, albeit morbid, read. Cloak of Deception was the tool used to provide excellent background for Star Wars fans. Valorum is given much more of a role than in Episode I, along with each of the Senators we glimpsed for brief seconds in the movie. The taxation of trade routes finally makes sense as well as Jedi, Judicial, and Senate activities. Despite this book being the beginning of a saga, many old friends join us n this well thought out story, Darsha Assant and Anoon Bondara from Darth Maul. Vergere from Rogue Planet and the New Jedi Order. Even Tarkin and Sate Pestage make their brief appearances. This is a very worthy and exciting read. Enjoy.

0060920084|4.0|A window-shoppers' guide to the United States, The Lost Continent is an array of towns,<br />scenery and people given but passing glances.  A head-spinning tour of thirty-eight states,<br />Bryson whisks us along freeways and back roads at a dizzying.  However brisk, this tour<br />doesn't inhibit Bryson's expressing views on the merit of everything he sees.  Nearly every<br />small community is boring.  The few urban centers he enters are dangerous [in his eyes],<br />confusing and dirty.  National parks or historical sites are crowded with obnoxious,<br />overweight or overage tourists.  In short, this book leaves you with the idea that wherever is<br />home is where you should remain.  In his case, this is Des Moines, Iowa.  To those who have<br />seen Iowa or met Iowans, the proposal has some merit.<br />After a sojourn in Britain, Bryson has [temporarily] returned to the American Midwest to<br />launch a journey of exploration.  To those living elsewhere, the American term &quot;Midwest&quot; is<br />something of a puzzle.  Bryson reinforces the perception of the region being rather &quot;Middle&quot;<br />as he tours various American cities, towns and villages.  The contrast between &quot;small town&quot;<br />and urban America remains as stark as it was in Mencken's day.  &quot;Middle&quot; America appears<br />drab, self-contained, inward looking and static, changing only in details.  The urban scene is<br />rushed, dynamic, perceived dangerous and swamped by consumerism.  The cultural<br />advantages of cities are ignored.  In fact almost the only observation on cultural elements is<br />his failure to find a bookstore in Auburn, Alabama, a college town.<br />Bryson has a keen capacity for observation.  His Iowa roots remain the fundament of his view,<br />but he observes American communities of all sizes with a penetrating eye.  Such a perspective<br />can only be achieved by one who has been elsewhere and retains a receptive outlook.  Having<br />known Midwesterners who traveled the world and seen nothing, his breadth of vision is<br />refreshing.  Imparting his observations with stinging wit, he keeps his readers in keen<br />expectation for the next phase of the journey.  His style encourages you to remain with him as<br />he rapidly moves across the face of the United States.  The pace is hectic - the thoughtful<br />reader may pause to wonder how Bryson can render his judgments with the limited time he<br />remains in each place.  Those seeking more penetrating views of America should be reading<br />histories, not travel accounts.<br />This is a very American view of the world.  The title contains &quot;Continent&quot;, but even close<br />brushes with Canada are avoided; after all, this is where American winters originate.  He<br />even expresses the &quot;belief - no, the understanding-that America is the richest and most<br />powerful nation on earth because God likes us best.&quot;  It's a view he clearly subscribes to, even<br />if the &quot;real America&quot; abides around Des Moines.  A consummate Midwesterner, Bryson thrice<br />glimpses the Atlantic Ocean without comment, but never reaches the Pacific.  He likes<br />mountains, so long as they don't produce snow, and unspoiled hilly country.  Well, don't we<br />all?<br />Bryson's wit leaves us breathless.  His descriptive ability brings us beside him, in the car,<br />restaurant or strolling along a Main Street.  Droll observations keep us happily entranced,<br />impatient to have him reveal and react to his next disappointment or discovery.  and conceals<br />his lack of depth.  The pace is too fast to allow us to see what's lacking until the final pages.<br />By then, it's far too late.  We've come to sympathize with his encounters with unpleasant<br />waitresses, inhabiting grungy motels and missing meals.  Instead of research, he has Mobile<br />Travel Guides, distilled versions of history and geography.  These booklets don't fail him, but<br />then he asks little of them.  Even when they don't provide sufficient information on which<br />roads to follow, he blames the locals for failing to provide proper road signs.  Given that so<br />many of the routes he takes are for local transport and not interstate tourism, the lack is<br />hardly surprising.  He doesn't live and pay taxes in the communities he chastises.<br />A traveller's account, not a guidebook; even his criticisms are charming since it's his feelings being expressed.  He doesn't demand you follow either his route or his thinking.  Indeed,<br />there are many places where suggestions are offered and could be followed.  The National<br />Parks Service's role in Yosemite and Yellowstone parks are examples.  Better management<br />requires better knowledge of conditions.  He doesn't state it explicitly, yet it's fairly clear that<br />the Service is well down on the list of American priorities and requires elevating.<br />In short, this is an entertaining read, but not something to take on a driving trip to these<br />places.

B00004T9UF|5.0|My favorit CD ever this isnt a CD to gather up the family and lisen to it during dinner but it is great for partys and just  lisening to it where ever.
B000002MTR|5.0|The first impression I get from this record is that it's produced differently. Californication is very raw and ringy, a bit like BSSM and quite hard to listen to. The production on OHM is nice, it brings out the music. The songs themselves are great, Navarro's guitars add a more layered sound making, overall, a more mature-sounding CD. I especially like Aeroplane and Walkabout, very groove-orientated and Chad does his job better than ever. The album may disappoint fans that have become attached to the Chilli Peppers original style, but I enjoyed listening to it simply because it is different; they explore a new sound (which I actually prefer) that they all but lost when Frusciante rejoined the band for Californication. Overall a great album that you might like, just don't expect the same music that you usually would from the Chilli Peppers.
B000002U82|5.0|Only 3 albums have changed my life. Bowie's Outside, Muse's Origin of Symmetry, and this.<BR>A way to describe this is incredible. The best ones on here are probably Great Gig in the Sky, Any colour you like, and Eclipse. it never fails to amaze me how the album climaxes on this final song, the perfect end to a perfect album.<BR>I'm not a massive Floyd fan, but this was the first album I heard of theirs and I now have wish u were here and the wall, im impressed by these, and hope their others live up to the high standards. fantastic.
0060934913|4.0|I saw Anthony Bourdain on Oprah one afternoon. They shot a bit in his kitchen at Les Halles, and he was standing around, spinning a knife, while he showed America the secrets of restaurant food. He seemed like a pretty funny guy, and I eat way too many meals out, so I thought I would like to read his book. I waited for the paperback edition, because I am poor from eating out too much. And let me say first of all, there are no weird typos or random commas in this edition as there seem to have been in the hardback.<br />I suppose it could have been better organized, and there are a lot of things that i would have liked to know. I gather that his wife has been with him since his college days, but I don't know when he got married exactly. Also, he never explained what a garde-manger is. In the new preface for the paperback, he says that he wrote the book really for other cooks/chefs to read, so he maybe didn't think of explaining it. (A garde-manger is the cold foods station, I recently found out, for salads and appetizers and that sort of thing.) There are a few things like this that take a little bit from one's enjoyment of the book.<br />Anyway, it's a wonderful book. It is truly truly funny. It is so difficult to write humorously, but Bourdain really did a fine job. I don't know how many times I laughed aloud. I just wanted to keep reading it. I think I stayed up until about three in the morning to finish it. It's not fine literature, but it is whole lot of fun.<br />There are a lot of reviews here by people who were shocked by all the sex and drugs and profanity and how very self-absorbed Bourdain is. I think Bourdain knows exactly how arrogant he is. Half of the fun is in seeing how his arrogance got him into trouble over the years. He may be arrogant, but he also has no fear of showing the reader how completely foolish he can be. And I think he has a great amount of respect and even tenderness beneath his profane, macho shell. For example, he talks a lot about the sex that goes on, but he is personally involved in none of it. He is married, so maybe he just doesn't want to talk about it for his wife's sake, but still, he doesn't seem to be nearly as bad as you might think if you were not paying attention. And he also does appreciate and respect really great chefs, while freely admitting that he is not a really great chef. He has respect for the chefs that don't work in a pirate galley and who turn out beautiful and delicious food every night with consistency and grace. <br />He loves the business he is in. He loves people who really love food. He seems like a fun guy, and his book is a fun book. I highly recommend it.

6305342776|1.0|Of all the things in my life I'd like to change the one that tops the list has got to be the last 2 hours. For some reason I decided to rent The Black Hole. Oh my god, it is so darn dull. I feel like my soul has been sun dried then eroded to dust by the wind. I'm near tears for wanting the time back. I had thought the movie was dull when I was a kid yet some evil force conspired to make me watch it again. Now my body feels like I'm in the middle of a life threatening flu.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I know there is lots of folks who wish that Radiohead would just resume Bends-style alterna-rock but I am not one of them. Also I am not one who sees Kid-A as being that radical with the intergration of electronics into the mix. I simply love this album! Certain songs on this album are just sound paintings ( the &quot;Miro to music&quot; feel of &quot;The Pyramid Song&quot; and flat out surrealistic haze of &quot;Knives Out&quot;.) while others update certain musical styles(The ambient old timey feel of &quot;You and Whose Army&quot; and The New Orleans blue vibe of &quot;Life in A Glass House&quot;.). Alot is made of the electronic influence throughout ( The Teutonic freeze of the awesome &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; for example.) but I am especially impressed with the capable orchestral florishes which appear in a song like &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot;. It is no easy task to create great emotive songs in cinemascope. Make no mistake though every song has its moment. From the cybernetical enhanced mope rock of &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; to the gorgeous re-imagining of Kid A's &quot;Morning Bell&quot; The only fault I can find with this album is the sheer draining nature of it. The best thing to listen to after it is silence. It deserves that sort of time just to sink in. It has a density more often found in fiction than in music.
B00000I8NC|5.0|only two tracks - only a half hour of material they wrote during one of their concert tours.  this is fine by me.  infinity symbol lats a little long - a little over 60 minutes i get through two tracks and need a little break....that was what was nice w/ lift your skinny fists...which isn't available on amazon anymore....it was 2 disks composed of 40min on each disk..anyway - this album combinds the debut w/ their latest release...the first was very quiet and their last one was more loud this fits in the middle - easier to approach than the otehr two.  the same feelsing of dispair are incorperated...along w/ the liner notes a excert from teh bible explaining loss of the earth and being mislead by god.  makes you feel all warm inside doens't it? well, thats gybe for you. enjoy this i wish i had gotten it first in some ways its the best one.
B000002JS6|5.0|Let me just put it this way: I've listened to this album all the way through at least 200 times. I'm pretty sure I've listened to at least one song off this album, every day, for the last 2 years. And I'm STILL not even close to being sick of it. It's that good. However silly it seems, Angus and Malcolm are two of the greatest musical minds of our century. Laugh all you want. Most rock bands would sell their souls to be able to write riffs like this. Pure genious.
0452282152|5.0|Girl With a Pearl Earring is the story of Griet, young housemaid in the Vermeer home. Vermeer is a very well-respected painter and his work is highly valuable today, since he only painted 35 known pieces. In this work of fiction, Griet is, basically, Vermeer's young muse. After she moves into the house to assist Vermeer's wife, she slowly is befriended by the painter and becomes his assistant.<br />This book is full of rich characters...from the seemingly aloof Vermeer himself, to the bratty and spiteful daughter Cornelia. One of the highlights of the book is Maria Thins, the grandmother of the house, and one of the few friends Griet can trust. Maria is a quiet conspirator to help Griet in all the problems she has throughout the story. <br />There isn't one point in this book where it becomes unbelievable. The whole story is spectulation as to who the young girl in the painting Girl With the Pearl Earring actually is. This book will pull you into Griet's world and convince you that her life and story took place exactly as written by Chevalier. Overall, this is a rich, warm, and atmospheric work that is deserving of its best-seller status.
6304795254|4.0|When watching &quot;The Game&quot; for the first time, one will be pleasantly surprised by the film's continuous twist and turns literally leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat. It's almost impossible to predict the outcome of this mystery/thriller, all the more so because of director David Fincher's penchant for draping his film with ominous shadows and uncomfortable flashbacks dealing with alienation and suicide. &quot;The Game&quot; does not feel like the kind of film headed anywhere near a comfortable resolution. And if one recalls Fincher's previous effort, the dark and thoroughly depressing &quot;Seven,&quot; you know he is a director uninhibited when it comes to detailing the demons which haunt his psyche.<br />In &quot;The Game,&quot; rarely has the San Francisco locale seemed so dark and dreary. The rain-soaked streets, abandoned skyscrapers and lonely mansions are displayed in an almost gothic fashion, reminding one of the lonely fog-shrouded sets of early Hammer horror films. Drop into this desolate atmosphere the alienated and secluded protagonist played by Michael Douglas, and viewers find themselves in a most uncomfortable motion picture. The tension rarely lets up, as Sean Penn, who plays Douglas' kid brother, appears on the scene to offer a birthday present to his brother -- a game that will have a profound affect on his life.<br />Douglas, out of boredom more than anything else, eventually visits the company which will offer &quot;The Game.&quot; He soon discovers that the private and lonely existence he has forged has been violated with eerie mannequin clowns appearing in his driveway and television sets talking to him rather than reporting the stocks. Soon, nothing is what it seems, not even his relationship with his brother, and Douglas finds himself hunted by mysterious men and answering phone calls that play back conversations he's had previously.<br />Throw into this tumultuous mix a wise-cracking waitress (played with silky ease by Deborah Unger) who becomes Douglas' ally, and the viewer is in for a halloween-like rollercoaster ride complete with runaway taxi cabs, blazing machine guns and chases through lonely alley ways. All of this frantic activity eventually leads to the top of a downtown office building, where Douglas is confronted with a desperate choice -- either accept &quot;The Game&quot; as just that, or realize his life is truly in danger, protecting himself at all costs. His decision may not surprise the viewer, but the resolution absolutely will.<br />I'm not sure why I enjoy &quot;The Game&quot; so much, having seen it multiple times. Douglas' performance is fine, if not a bit derivative of his past work. Penn seems to enjoy himself in what is essentially a thankless cameo role. Unger, who steals many of her scenes, is appealing though nothing to write home about. <br />Perhaps what sets &quot;The Game&quot; apart is its atmosphere, undoubtedly fueled by Fincher. This is a director's film if ever there was one, complete with frantic pace, symbolic flashbacks, strategic camera angles and already-mentioned dark vision. While the over-the-top intensity of Fincher's better known efforts &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;The Fight Club&quot; is definitely in full bloom here, he does hold back just enough of those mischievous demons to make &quot;The Game&quot; his most mature and accessible effort. And thus, it is one of the finest works to date by one of the most interesting directors working today.
B000003TA4|5.0|Most of my mid-teendom was spent smoking pot and listening to Kurt Cobain wail about a denial.  I loved Nirvana then, and I love Nirvana now. I refuse to comment on Kurt Cobain's songwriting, for fear of misrepresenting him (a pet peeve of a musician, I would imagine, particularly Kurt Cobain), however, in reference to the sound, I can say nothing except that it is simply amazing. Nirvana achieves an ecstatic balance of guitar, bass, rusty, fuzzy, vocals, and driving drum beats. Although this Nirvana album leans a little further to the pop side than any of their others, it is the addictive catchiness of this pop element which lends Nevermind its replayability. It is unfair that Kurt Cobain get all the credit for this gem. He most certainly deserves much adulation, but Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl deserve just as much. Novoselic's basslines give songs like &quot;Smells like Teen Spirit&quot; and &quot;Come As You Are&quot; their somber heaviness, and Grohl's excellent driving drum beats raises Nevermind's sound above the formula which plagues many punk and hard rock bands. Nevermind has the same impact now as it did 10 years ago, when suburbia crowned its scraggly, reluctant savior.

B00004TJFL|5.0|I highly recommend this movie. this halloween, I suggest that you see Halloween 5, dont watch it alone ! this Halloween movie has not too high in blood, But this movie is more kinda.... a DARKER movie !! its dark in most of the scenes in this horror movie.  Jamie is back ! She still does a wonderful job as playing herself as a 10 year old girl. Alot of fright in this movie, and I think that it is an instant classic! I love Halloween 5. please rent it or own it, If you like the Halloween series and love all scary movies you will love this one !!!
0140434089|5.0|Whatever I say would not be enough to make you understand how I loose myself when reading this detective story.Actually this was my first try at a book written in that manner. But more or less I know Holmes' way of presenting crime and mysterious events. Moonstone goes far beyond the limit of these cliche detective scope and reaches to your hearts with its seven different characters;all narrating their own side of the story centering on an oriental myth of a sacred gem. There is the historical background, the emotional diologues, and finally the inevitable conciseness in language while dictating the action, just like in all detective stories. Wilkie Collins' touch can be seized when you go deep into characters such as Ezra Jennings. There is lot of things to be explored and make fun of! Don't be afraid of the length and page number:). When you follow the moonstone in its journey to home, you WILL DISCOVER OTHER THINGS SUCH AS LOVE, HUMAN SUFFERING other than the war given for the priceless Indian DiamOnd.<BR>Best Wishes On Your Journey Whoever You Are Wherever You ARE!
B00003CXN4|5.0|Traffic goes on the short list of great movies in the year 2000 that includes Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Almost Famous. The movies strongest attributes are its exceptional cast and moving story. Everyone is perfectly cast and there isn't an actor I would change. The brightest of all these bright stars are Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro (who won best supporting actor), and Don Cheadle. The story is told like Nashville and Magnolia. There are several mini stories that intertwine. I also loved the different colored lenses for each story. The DVD has superb picture and sound quality. If you're one of those people that likes a truck load of extras though, I suggest you wait for a special edition to be released. If not run to your local movie store and pick this baby up!
0399146253|5.0|Kay Scarpetta has really been put through the wringer in this one!  The reader gets so involved that the plot twists and turns leave you gasping. This is the best Cornwell I have read and I can't wait to read the next one.
B00005J6UP|4.0|Good overall, but still didnt have all the deleted/cut scenes on the dvd. Only had some of them.
B000059MEK|4.0|Before buying this album, I had heard some of the tracks from their previous album &quot;Homework&quot;. I was impressed with Daft Punk's creative approach by setting an individual sound to themselves, but using the backing of familar &quot;4 to the floor&quot; beats that House music contains. This CD was a mixed bag in my opinion, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.I have to admit that when I bought this CD I thought I had wasted my money on only 2 good tracks and that the rest was filler. But I gave it a chance with a few more complete listens. My opinion changed...mostly. I noticed that a few tracks here are instantly appreciable dance music tunes (ie. &quot;One More TIme&quot;, &quot;Aerodynamic&quot;) compared to others that may take some time to grow on you, but intice an equal amount of satifaction when realized.(ie. Highlife, HBFS, Face To Face, Superheroes, Crescendolls). These I find the only good DANCE songs on the album. 4 tracks that I found were less danceable, yet very good were Verdis Quo, Voyager, Nightvision,and Short Circuit. I'm taking this from a DJ mixing perspective to what songs could potentially mixed into a dance set well, or that it's individual song feel was interesting to me. The rest of the songs on the album I found to be either filler, or potentially good songs that were blundered horribly mostly due to the vocals. My prime example of this is Digital Love when I first heard it sounded like a commercial,mostly due to the cheesy-sounding vocals, and now I know why after seeing the horrific sight of Daft Punk dancing around on a GAP commercial. Overall, definitely good album, but my message to Daft Punk: Keep up the good work guys, but PLEASE don't let the commercialism bug devour your talent, I could feel it nibbling a bit when listening to this album.
6304106017|1.0|From Dusk Till Dawn is an awful movie. It is really bad. It's a shame. It had a lot of great, talented people in it and a promising premise. It completely went out of control. It was too much!. It was too much to the point where you lose hold of it and completely lose interest immediatley. An awful, awful waste of a movie.
0689825498|5.0|I work at a Day Care and we have this book.  It's one of the kids' favorites because they love lifting the flaps.  They all know the book by heart by now so sometimes they read it to me.  The books is easy for kids to understand and isn't full of big words that make them confused.  This book is sure to be a winner.
B0000542DG|4.0|Final Destination managed to stay away from other horror films that totally ripped off Scream. It was new, different, and very original. It was the only Post-\\"Scream\\" film that managed to not follow that film's style and to set out to find it's own voice. I can safely say that it succeeded. The film is about a bunch of graduating high schoolers who are heading on a plane for a graduation trip to France. Lucky students!. One of the kids has a premonition while on the plane that it explodes. When he awakes and finds that things are happening like they did in his premonition, well, he freaks, and he gets himself and a couple of other students and a teacher off the plane. When what he saw happens, the surviving people who got off the plane find themselves being hunted by Death itself. It was their time and they cheated death. But you don't cheat death. You can't. And he is making sure they know that.  The sense of doom and death, without there being a flesh and blood villain, is very creepy. It definitley works. The movie managed to do that without, like I said, a killer. That doesn't happen very often. I always believe that while it is fun to have a flesh and blood killer, and to see the likes of Freddy, Michael, and Jason, the real fear and terror is in what you don't see. This films takes that and runs with it. The actors are all good with the subject material they are given. Ali Larter is a real find. She plays Clear Rivers, a shy type who really grows and blossoms throughout the film. Kerr Smith was perfect as an annoying bully. You really wanted him to die. Does he?. Well, you'll have to watch. \\"American Pie\\" star, Sean William Scott, also appears in the film. As does \\"Candyman\\" star, Tony Todd. He and Larter are the only ones to return for the sequel. But the main star is teen pin-up, Devon Sawa. I am by no means a fan of this guy, but he does a fairly decent job as the film's main victim, Alex Browning. The movie has many clever set pieces. Some of the set ups and of the deaths are quite clever and intelligently shot. The sequel, however, went even further and the kills and inventiveness have gone up several notches. It was shot great and looks sharp. Do yourself a favor....See this!. One of the better recent teen thrillers.
0792841433|5.0|While lacking the intellectual and emotional depth of most of Truffaut's work, *Bride* is a classic on its own terms--a darkly comic Hitchcock tribute/parody and revenge epic of nearly mythic proportions.  Jeanne Moreau is brilliant as the gorgeous and unstoppable avenger who neatly works her way down the list of men (a playboy, a neurotic loser, a sleazy politician, a gangster and an artist) responsible for her husband's tragic/comic demise on the cathedral steps years before.  Each method of murder is more creative and outlandish than the last and the narrative is peppered with clever little references like one of the victims living on &quot;Nemesis St.&quot; and the killer taking a job in an art studio posing as Diana the Huntress.
B00005LC6Z|4.0|John Carpenter's chilling 1978 classic \\"Halloween\\" was a true benchmark for terror. Anything following it would not stand a chance of being as good. While some 'Halloween' sequels were very good(4 and H20), some were also bad(3 and 6). This follow up to the original is in the 'good' category. The film, however, fails to capture the real terror of the original. It tries very hard. The story continues on the same night as the original. Laurie has been transfered to the Haddonfield hospital. Michael has survived(!)and overhears on a kid's radio that the victims have been taken to the hospital. The kid with the radio is the son of Dick Warlock who played Michael. There, Michael hacks his way thru the staff to get to Laurie. Dr. Loomis is hot on his trail. It is also in this film that we learn the truth behind Laurie and Michael's connection. So, in that regard, this movie is pivotal in the series' history. It is very eerily shot and looks good, but it doesn't hold a candle to the original. It comes close at times. Director Rick Rosenthal definitley went to the ' John Carpenter School ' when he set out to direct this movie. He got the angles and the mood down right. What he didn't get down right was the characters and the emotional pull of the first film. The writers of this film also turned the Laurie Strode character into a nothing role. You rooted for her in the original, but in this one you barely remember she's even in the darn thing!. It was almost as if the Laurie Strode character was an after thought until the final chase and showdown in the climax. Donald Pleasence was great, but Jamie Lee Curtis was given way less to do. She has a much smaller part in this one. Her part kicks in in the last half. This film plays more like a standard \\"Friday The 13th\\" slasher film than the bloodless, suspense filled original. It works most of the time. The other characters in the movie don't fare as well as the few in the original. There is no one in the movie, besides Laurie, that you would care about one way or the other if they died or not. Very undeveloped. They are all just typical knife fodder who would of been just as useless in a Jason movie. Dick Warlock, as Michael Myers, is a very good Michael. At least I think so. He has the creep factor and the walk down pat. The mask is a little altered from the original. I have mixed feelings on the mask. Still, it's a fun, entertaining chapter to the series. Don't expect anything close to the original masterpiece. This film, along with the original and H20 make for a teriffic trilogy of films. The others, while some are okay, don't matter as much. Halloween 2 is not great art, but it's a fun horror film. It had a tough job to do to follow the classic original. It tried it's best, and even though it didn't completely succeed, it came okay. I enjoy it and I think any fan would too.
B00004RYZT|5.0|This 17 song set captures all the intensity of a Rammstein live show. From the opener, 'Spielt Mit Mir' to the closing 'Seemann', Live Aus Berlin is packed with footage from Rammstein's stop in Berlin in August of 1999. This DVD catches all of the violence, the emotion, and the fire of Rammstein. Unfortunately, the DVD version cuts Buck Dich out, but the extras and improved picture and sound quality make the DVD the overall better purchase. Rammstein uses a lot of stage theatrics, from costumes, to flamethrowers, fireworks, and slick lighting, to make the show more exciting for the audience. Till Lindemann even sets himself on fire (wearing a special suit, of course) during the song, 'Rammstein.' I don't know what's cooler than that? Their musicianship is tight and top-notch as ever, just as good live as in the studio. The extras include an interview with the whole band, as well as multi-angle views of 'Tier', 'Du Hast', and 'Rammstein'. If you're a Rammstein fan, this is an essential to own, a real Rammstein fan would be hard-pressed not to have this in his or her collection. It's a much better buy, in my opinion, than the 'Live Aus Berlin' CD, the visuals are half of Rammstein's show. Available on VHS and DVD.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This DVD is more than you'd expect for this movie. The best part overall, is the introduction of a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack (the DVD has been out in the UK for a while) but if you want a real treat, watch the deleted scenes on the second disc and be gob smacked at how Cameron would consider leaving these out of any restored edition. There's one superb scene between Reece and Connor when she realises they should take out Cyberdyne systems itself. The re-introduction of these scene into the main film (as with the others) would have fleshed out the movie a great deal and set the scene more for the sequel. The character development of Sarah Connor from unconfident waitress to gun-ho vigilante in the second would be less of a shock. Cameron states some of these scenes were removed to maintain the pace of the film, but now, 17 years later proper reinstatement would have breathed new life into the film. At least with the T2 disc we have the option to watch 1 of 3 versions.<br />Highly recommended. Not as good as the sequel, but great features, great menus, great packaging and good special features.
B00003CXA2|4.0|A movie like &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; can easily be misinpereted or over-examined to death, despite the fact it has an obviously simple story behind it: a man (with a 75 I.Q., played by Tom Hanks) drifts through rather turbulent times (from the 1950's to early 1980's), and tries to find a purpose in the world. There is the story of &quot;Gump&quot; in a nutshell. There's no great hidden politicial or sociological agenda in the story, outside of the obvious fact that life needs to be experienced, not mourned over (not a good thing to hear for a mild cynic like me). This is one of those films that was a surprise to see in my teenage years (like &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, both equally good films) and despite the criticism of &quot;Gump&quot; (and believe me when I say I've heard just about all of them and then some), I have only this piece of advice: lighten up, will you?  The DVD itself has some interesting stuff, such as several mini-documentaries of the making of the film (including two sequences that were never completed), commentary with the filmmakers, and more.  It's a movie that a somewhat cynical man like myself isn't afraid to admit he has in his film library.

6305807086|5.0|What fascinated me most about this film is it's originallity . The script is simply outragous . A wannabe famous puppeteer discovers a portal to Malkovich head which allows you to be him for 15 minutes . The guy deceides to try to use it for his financial profit with the help of his work-collegue Maxine ( Keener ) . Problems soon begin because his fiance Lotte ( Diaz ) tries to make her sexual turn a reality via the portal and he tries to get in bed with his object of lust Maxine with the same way .<br />The script has such high I.Q the viewer will have to see the movie several times to believe it . Jonze directs his film with a speedy , bold way . Scenes like the one where Diaz chases Keener into J.Malkovich's subconscious memories or the one where Malkovich actually enters his own mind are hysterical moments of a creative banquet . The characters nad further more the dialogues ( &quot; ... after dinner i'll introduce you to my chimp Elija &quot; ) are irresistably crazy and fun while all the cast delivers great perfomances . Special credit should be given to Diaz though who was brave enough to go after the role of the sexual frustrated Lotte and hide her good looks under a huge wig .<br /> After the end titles you can't help but wondering if you ever gonna see a movie like this again .
B00003CXRO|5.0|Sometimes life has a way of putting us in situations that test our ability to survive a traumatic event. We have to rely on our instincts, use what available resources we have at our disposal, and keep hope, as well as ourselves, alive. We have to go deeper within ourselves to use strength we never knew existed. We emerge from our experience with greater wisdom, no longer able to exist in the world as we once did, because our perspective has changed. And we become better people, more acutely aware of what's important in life. This movie tells the story of a man thrust into a very difficult experience, and how he learns to survive it. Tom Hanks gives a stunning performance. It is beautifully photographed and scripted. Cast Away is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
6302820448|5.0|This movie is about a day repeating over and over. Basically, it's like a twilight zone type thing. But it's really cool. I mean, the way it repeats itself is funny and cool. This movie is great!
0316776963|5.0|&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is simply the funniest book I have ever read. This auto-biographical look into the ironic and vigorously funny anecdotes of Sedaris's life offer the reader a bizzare sense of hope, and an invitation to take life less seriously. These are stories that make you cry with laughter and beg to be read aloud to friends. I can't imagine that David Sedaris is for everyone, however. This is not a book that I would gift to my grandparents or in-laws, but for an adventurous fun person with a decent sense of humor, &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; will certainly become a favorite.
6303257844|5.0|I watched this movie while speeding on a bus from southern Mexico to Belize: the bus company apparently thought it a good way to get us relaxed. Maybe this extraordinary setting colors my perception, but I really loved this movie: loads of action, fingernail biting stunts and a plot that was quite inventive.
B00003CXA2|5.0|What a great disk!  I loved the original movie a lot and this DVD was no disappointment.  For a movie that's 7 years old, they provided great documentaries, technical and special effect details, and many other extras.  I wish more pre-DVD era movies were re-released with so much attention to what makes a DVD great.
6302814359|2.0|As it usually goes, a military gas canister is opened(this time by a child)and the fumes cause the dead to rise and cause havoc among the living. This is more of a parody than a sequel but unfortunately, it is not that funny nor is is remotely scary. There are a few moments that will make you grin(zombie's stopping their attack momentarily as something good pops up on the t.v.)but nothing more. The effects are okay but nothing special and the rehashed plot feels like it was hastily thrown together without any effort or concern for originality. If you want something different in a zombie flick, try the 3rd installment of return of the living dead. It is a dark, depressing tale of impossible love that takes the zombie idea in a completely different direction...that of a teenager and his girlfriend, a lovely woman who has become a zombie.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Carrie may not have been the first &quot;teen&quot; horror movie, but it was the first one anyone took very seriously. Infact Sissy Spacek earned an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the title character. Everything, all the elements of the film, story, editing, music, photography - come together seamlessly to tell the tale Carrie White with a power that time hasn't faded in almost twenty-five years. Today CARRIE is as much a genre classic as FRANKENSTIEN. <br />The tragic tale of a tortured misfit who unleashes a terrible vengeance upon her tormentors was first released in 1976. Directed by a young Brian DePalma the film features an incredible combination of talent both in front and behind the camera- and it shows in every frame. <br />This new &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD shows the film in it's original wide screen format (unlike an earlier '98 release), the image quality is really excellent, as is the sound quality. I viewed it on a stereo system, but the box boasts a surround sound feature as well for all of you out there with the good stuff. <br />Also featured are two documentaries about the making of the film. One, &quot;Visulizing Carrie,&quot; is a discussion of all the behind the scenes decisions that went into the making of the film. And the other one is &quot;Acting Carrie,&quot; a film that talks with the actors about the film. <br />Probably the only truly &quot;dated&quot; feature on the DVD is the original trailer. It's a hoot. <br />All in all, this edition of CARRIE should be a must have for horror fans and movie collectors. The importance of the film, while overlooked for years, is obvious from the moment the movie starts until it's terrible conclusion. It's a powerful film that's influence can still be seen in today's Hollywood, beautifully presented on this DVD.

However, ... listed this as \\"hardcover.\\" I thought I would be getting a clothbound with clothbound size print. ... sent me a paperback with a hard cover on it.

6305232660|4.0|Deep Impact is a subdued film regarding what mght happen during a comet impact of the Earth. As such, its not a perfect movie by any means. There are several issues that are gotten wrong despite the fact that the Shoemakers (of Comet Shoemaker-Levy fame) consulted on the movie.<br />That being said, a movie like this is always a tightrope between accuracy and entertainment and I think Deep Impact hit the right balance between the two, ultimately. The movie is accurate enough with its science, although there are some holes, yes.  It is also sincere enough with its drama without going realistically overboard. Face it, done really realistically, this movie's content would depress you to suicide. Here I think the right decision was made to tone down the portrayal of panic that would accompany an announcement like this.<br />And in the end, I think the film's best attributes - ironically - are in public awareness and education. Such a collison of another body with Earth will happen, its just a matter of time. We are the only species on the planet that MIGHT be able to do something about it, but only if we start searching and keep searching now.<br />Why do I say &quot;ironically&quot; this film is good for public awareness and education? &quot;Deep Impact&quot; portrays a comet's collison with Earth. Even if we search really well a comet will, in all probabilty, be discovered too late to really do anything about. But we can also be hit by asteroids and those we can search for, plot, predict (to some degree) and push out of the way. That might give us a few more centuries.  8-)

0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember, was the first book I've ever read by Nicholas Sparks and he has immediately become my favourite author. The plot of his book was simple and predictable, yet it was the way he wrote it that truly captivated me, full of feeling and passion. It made me smile when Landon and Jamie's love blossomed and cry when I found out how their love was doomed and how they were never going to be with each other. And the ending of the book was just so powerful that i couldn't stop talking about the book for months and even now i remember it, for A Walk to remember is truly a memorable book that is absolutely worth reading and crying over.
0802136834|5.0|Alison Weir does a wonderful job introducing you to Henry Tudor and his six wives.  You get a real sense of what pressures King Henry was under, what his dreams and expectations were, and how the everyday routine of royalty influenced his decisions.<br />I've taken my share of European history in high school and college, but I'll confess that my knowledge of this man was simply that he was grossly overweight and that he had no problem killing his wives when he tired of them.  So, finding out that he was the epitome of masculine beauty, intelligence, athleticism and progressive thinking was a real eye-opener.<br />Even more, was the wealth of material presented to give life to each of the six women who married this complex man.  You'll feel despair for Katherine of Aragon; anger at Anne Boleyn; sorrow for Jane Seymour; fear for Anne of Cleves; pity for Katherine Howard; and admiration for Katherine Parr.  In addition, you'll learn a great deal about his children:  Mary, Elizabeth and Edward.  <br />A real plus for history buffs...all of the intrigues at court surrounding the various wives and children, the advancement of families and the religious struggles.<br />All in all, a great read.
1573225517|1.0|I wish I hadn't seen all the Woody Allen movies and just read Dave Eggers, because then I might've liked this book.  I found this book extremely pretentious and boring.  The theme of losers content with being losers is in all of these &quot;slacker contemporary novels,&quot; and it's getting so tiresome.  If you're a loser, don't read this book, because reading a book about losers is a waste of time.
B00003CXRM|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen this year. This was highly recommended by some work associates and I gave it a try. This movie seems to work on all levels and was a very enjoyable and fun movie to watch. I immediately watched it again a 2nd time which is something I almost never do. The music is very enjoyable and well matched to the movie. While not the music I typically listen to, it creates the right moods and lingers after the movie is done. I'll probably get the CD as well. Bravo! This is a well done and satisfying work that will become a classic.
6304712936|5.0|I had the great pleasure of seeing Amadeus in its opening week in a 70mm print with six tracks of surround-sound.  The clarity and scope of Miroslav Ondricek's cinematography was breathtaking - but then, so was everything else about this film.  I would go on to see it four more times in theaters (in 70mm and 35mm prints of varying quality), and countless times on video tape, laserdisc, and now DVD.<br />Amadeus is a &quot;fantasia&quot; on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) that centers on the age-old rumor that he was murdered by a jealous rival, composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham).  Don't let its subject matter fool you - Amadeus is thoroughly contemporary filmmaking at its best.  And the DVD, despite the many complaints, serves it well.  Yes, it is a &quot;flipper&quot; (somewhat annoying), and yes, it lacks commentary tracks, deleted material, or a &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; documentary.  But what more can be added to the staggering accomplishment of the film itself?<br />Much can be said about the performances, the writing, the music, Dick Smith's extraordinary old-age make-up, Milos Forman's direction, the costumes, etc.  In fact, Amadeus is a virtual catalog of &quot;best practices&quot; in each category. But to put the brilliance of Amadeus into words is to diminish it; like trying to convey the qualities of a Mozart opera by talking endlessly about the melodies, harmonies, and libretto.  To put it simply, no amount of description can do justice to the total effect.  I have seen Amadeus literally more times than I can recall.  It is to me like a favorite song or poem; I never tire of it.<br />Consider how this film towers over its own makers: aside from Amadeus, what else can you remember about the careers of F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hulce, Elizabeth Berridge, Simon Callow, or Christine Ebersole?  Or any of the other artists, in front of or behind the camera, who helped to put it on screen? As gifted as they are, no other project has fit them so perfectly.  Amadeus took on a life of its own, symbiotically fed off their unique talents and, in return, gave them each their most perfect expression.  It is as though each artist was born specifically to contribute his or her unique vision to this film.<br />If there is one thing that is consistently under-appreciated about Amadeus, though, it is its editing.  While it does not break new ground, or even draw attention its own technique (like Eisentsein's Battleship Potempkin, for example), Amadeus nonetheless demonstrates that there is no more powerful a cinematic device than a perfectly executed cut from one shot to another.it them so perfectly.

B00005K3OT|5.0|A contest between spirituality and life, the plot of this movie thrilled me.  A French village chooses between abstinence (Lent) and earthly pleasures (chocolate).<br />Extrordinary acting, scenery, costumes, directing and sound.<br />Without a doubt, this movie is on my list of all-time favorites!
B00003CXAR|5.0|Anyone old enough to remember the Summer of '75 will recall the sheer terror caused by the 20-foot mechanical shark in Steven Spielberg's classic horror film &quot;Jaws&quot;. Not only did this flesh-ripping Great White take a huge chunk out of the worldwide box office, it also put a dent in the profits of beach towns on both coasts. No one wanted to go anywhere near the ocean! Heck, you couldn't even jump into a kiddie pool without some prankster breaking into a couple bars of the classic &quot;Jaws&quot; theme. (Da-Dum-Da-Dum-Da-Dum...) The media, in fact the whole world, was caught up in a stupifying feeding frenzy of Shark-Mania. You see, &quot;Jaws&quot; wasn't merely a movie; it was an EVENT! It was the original Summer Blockbuster. But, unlike the majority of mega-movies it spawned, &quot;Jaws&quot; was worth every penny of the $3.50 we movie-goers forked over in 1975. In a stroke of genius, Spielberg kept us squirming by not allowing us to see the toothy, blood-lusting shark for the first hour of the film. We only witnessed the bone-crunching damage that this monster had inflicted. When the Great White finally surfaced, a collective gasp could be heard throughout the theatre. Nevertheless, we had faith in Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider -- the heroic hunters who set off to sea in a small fishing vessel named, ironically, &quot;Orca&quot;. But, alas, we knew that indeed they'd need &quot;a bigger boat&quot;. The inevitable showdown between man and maneater was more horrifying than anything we'd ever seen on the big screen. But, ultimately, in the end, we let out a whopping round of applause and got right back in line to see it again. (Well, some of us unemployed youth actually hid in the bathroom between shows!) Everything about &quot;Jaws&quot; worked. The suspense, the music, the chemistry of the stellar cast and, of course, the big rubber shark kept us coming back for more. Finally, after years of suffering through heavily edited pan and scanversions on Cable TV, we are treated to a beautiful widescreen version of &quot;Jaws&quot;. This DVD is truly worth it. The print itself is crisp and clean. The entire soundtrack, most notably John Williams' chilling score, is greatly enhanced by the DTS. For my money, the &quot;Making of Jaws&quot; documentary included within is worth the price of admission alone. Overall, a job well done and quite befitting of this all-time classic. Highly recommended.
B000002L82|5.0|This is my second favourite NO album (my fave being Low-life). As with every New Order album, it sounds very different from everything that came before it and everything that came after it. In this case, it's very synthesizer-heavy and &quot;experimental&quot; -- &quot;586&quot; being the case in point. Nearly every track on this album is excellent, and &quot;Your Silent Face&quot; is probably the best song New Order has ever written -- slow, ethereal and painfully gorgeous. And just as a side note - my first experience with this album was on LP, and since I couldn't figure out which was side A (in true New Order form, nowhere on the packaging was there a tracklist or any other helpful information), I decided that the album began with &quot;Your Silent Face&quot; and ended with &quot;586.&quot; I think it actually flows better that way. :)<br />But yeah, this CD is an absolute must.
B000050XEI|5.0|Beautiful, haunting, mystical.  These words only scratch the surface of the music of this talented artist.  Enya's music is art for the ages.  Each time it is played, it renews itself in your spirit.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is the sound of a band ridding of their previous reputation. Up until then, The Beatles' image had been that of &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;. Sure, they had evolved considerably, with hits like &quot;Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, but no one really thought of them as a group that could really change the shape of pop and leave it like that permanently. Revolver changed all that.<br />You can tell from the first minute of &quot;Taxman&quot; that something is definitely different about this album. &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, with its beautiful strings and sad lyrics further confirms it. &quot;She Said She Said&quot; is undoubtedly one of the best pop songs ever made, while &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; has the Beatles pushing the envelope further than they ever had before. Quite simply, every song on here is perfect. And in the end, the Beatles left their mark on the world, and it's here to stay for a long, long time.

B000051VWW|5.0|I'm pretty sure I've written a review of this CD before, but, after seeing Sade in concert in Atlanta last week, I felt that I had to say more about Lovers Rock.  This CD fits so perfectly into the experience that is Sade.  She is truly one of a kind--something that is elusive in today's clone-driven, Britney Spears/NSync/BackstreetBoys flooded music scene.  Her music and her concerts are sparse, minimalist, intimate affairs that draw you the listener in and wrap you in a blanket of deepest joy and highest sorrow.  It is one thing to hear her on CD or tape or wax, but to see her LIVE is something altogether different!  Since the concert, I haven't listened to anyone but Sade, especially Lovers Rock.  She is not one of those performers that gives you a 24-track CD with only three decent songs.  No, Sade gives you 11 tracks of simple beauty.  She has garnered yet another committed, devoted fan in me.  Thank God for Sade!
B00005KHJR|5.0|This Limited Edition does include the version most of us know and love. Have any of the above crybabies documented *which* four minutes were &quot;gutted&quot; from the Extended version presented here? No. I have the old Magnum VHS tape, AND the Republic tape of the short version, and the aspect ratio presented on the DVD is NOT merely a cropped version of either tape. Fans of the film will not deny that the short theatrical cut is a travesty, but the extended version is a pleasure to watch. For those singing the praises of the Magnum tape, consider this: the Extended disc is the same cut, but of better quality. In fact, the DVD eliminates an issue on the tape that I've always found annoying, a cut in the dialogue with May Morrison just before the search of the town. Anchor Bay have again done a bang-up job in bringing us a great release of an excellent, but obscure film.
6305750750|3.0|The world of SW is changing.  The Bantham novels are replaced by Del Rey's New Jedi Order series, Dark Horse's comics are now set in a new era, and the latest SW film is released.<br />[sighs]<br />I guess I'm going to be one of the old whiners who sits back and tells long stories about the 'good old days or Stackpole, Zahn, and Irving Kershner'.  The new SW just fails to match.  I moaned on and on about the NJO series in my 'Vector Prime' review, so I won't put you throuogh that here.  The start of the new trilogy leaves a lot to be desired, though.<br />The story's okay, although it fails to reach a full potential.  Lucas tried to do a politcal/intruige/adventure/ect. job with this one, wheras the others were war/adventure movies.  Leave politics to guys like Stackpole and Zahn, as they do it much better.<br />The special effects are good, and it was great to see Coruscant in all its slendor for the first time.  The lightsabre battle was superb, although the land and space battles and the end had their potential muddled by the blabberings and buffoonery of Anakin and Jar Jar.  Sithspawn, they were annoying.<br />Pretty movie, and lots of info and the like for SW fans.  I can't say I reccomend it for those who aren't SW fans, though.  for those who do, watch it to see Palpatine at his best.  Only thing is, that's about all that's at its best.
B00003CXA2|5.0|You forget how good &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; is if you haven't seen it in a while.  I bought the 2-disk DVD of this 1994 Oscar-winning movie. Disk #1 has the film in Dolby Digital 5.1.  The sound is just right, and very aggressive where it needs to be, like in helicopter or ship at sea scenes. The image is very sharp in a widescreen version, and the colors are highly realistic. Two different selectable commentaries are among the best I've listened to. Disk #2 has all the &quot;extras&quot;, and lots of interesting ones at that. Most of the features are in Pro Logic, but the feature on &quot;sound design&quot;, appropriately, is in Digital Dolby 5.1. They really go into all the &quot;secrets&quot; of making the film. All-in-all quite a bargain DVD set.
0800132009|5.0|The last line sums it up very well, but I guess that's what war does to people. People are changed in many ways by it, and this is a good example of that. William Holden plays another roguish character who gets turned head-over-heels once more in his mission, as does Alec Guiness. Whatever the case, the movie starts out rather slow, then kicks it in as Holden joins the Canadian and the Britt on thier mission to destroy the bridge. Meanwhile, Alec Guiness and his men struggle to build that bridge and take pride in it.  Guiness's character is rather interesting. In some ways he's a very resolute man, yet in others somewhat fooled by his own resolution. Once again, that's what war and imprisonment do to you.<br />The climax is quite the nail-biter as you see person after person fall... But I won't spoil the whole bloody thing. Still, everyone seems driven on by their own different senses of pride and that, in the end, is what is their mutual downfall. The only person who seems to have a grip on reality by the end of this all is the doctor. And, I should mention, he's the one who stands on the riverbed looking at the battle-scarred area around him screaming 'Madness! Madness!' as the credits start to roll.<br />Very good movie. Reccomended.
B00003CXRP|5.0|THIS IS A FANTASTIC MOVIE ABOUT A TALE OF A MAN GETTING LOST FOR YEARS ON AN DESSERTED ISLAND....NO STORY THIS GREAT HAS BEEN TOLD SINCE ROBINSON CUROSO. A GREAT STORY FOR ALL AGES.
B00005JKG9|5.0|This movie is awesome.  Simply awesome.  Those who &quot;don't get it&quot; definitely have the mentality of three-year-olds.  If you enjoy acting and dialogue, I mean to tell you this is where it is at.<br />I will not bore you with the rehashed details of the plot.  But trust me, this is one of the best movies of all time.  And all without any car explosions or anyone being murdered.<br />If you are a mindless imp looking for a typical &quot;action&quot; flick, forget this one.  But if you are looking for GREAT ACTORS acting great, oh man, look no further!<br />Thanks GOD that the DVD may actually be made after all!
B00005A46T|5.0|Most bands would rather sell out with their sophomore album and Slipknot was probably expected to. To a lot of people's surprise they didn't. This cd tops the first one in every aspect. It's harder, louder, angrier, and more focused. I recommend this album to every fan of heavy music because it doesn't get much better than this.
B00003CX95|5.0|As mentioned by some of the other raters, this movie has a great plot, wonderful acting, unforgetable images, and ageless themes. The movie is a (historicaly not quite correct) story of William Wallace who led the Scots to great victories against the British before he was betrayed by his own, tortured and executed by the English. Mel Gibson once again shows his talents by combining his natural physical talents with his top-rate acting skills. The supporting cast members are all first-rate. This movie will be known as one of the 'new' great movies (Saving Privat Ryan, The Shawshank Redemption) of all time. The battle scenes are the most exciting and realistic that I have as yet seen filmed. The beautiful scenes of village life amidst the surrounding countryside are a wonderful contrast. I have to agree that there are so many vivid images, that it is difficult to select a few as examples. My most memorable images are Wallace's revenge, the many battle scenes and the torturing of Wallace. This is definately a watch again movie.
B000006ZDR|5.0|Black Sabbath released THE MOB RULES and has proven that they can still rock on without Ozzy Osbourne. Simply put, THE MOB RULES is one of the best heavy metal albums of all time! Ronnie James Dio is a superior singer &amp; songwriter. His talents in writing such classic songs like &quot;Turn Up The Night&quot;, &quot;Falling Off The Edge Of The World&quot;, &quot;The Sign Of The Southern Cross&quot;, &amp; The Mob Rules&quot; add more dimension to the legacy of Black Sabbath. Tony Iommi's guitar playing is still as menacing as ever. Geezer Butler's bass playing is superb &amp; Vinny Appice's drum playing is outstanding. THE MOB RULES is a testament to Black Sabbath's longevity &amp; talent. This line-up with Ronnie James Dio defiantely holds up to their past accomplishments with Ozzy Osbourne. By all means, if you are a heavy metal fan, you MUST have this album. 'Nuff said!
B00005B36H|5.0|The first thought that crossed my mind as I heard the single, &quot;Schism&quot;, was that Tool was amazing! I can say with absolute certainty that before this point, I wasn't a fan of Tool, I just really wasn't into their entire sound. They had some really good videos, excellent videos, but the music and I just never connected. Well not until the release of &quot;Schism&quot;. What can I say, I fell head over heels on this one.<BR>   Having the full album blasting through my earphones, and having 'Lateralus' on a regular walkman rotation for a couple of weeks, I've been given ample opportunity to explore it, and what I can say is that I'm reminded of my first encounters with early Ozzy--Black Sabbath. The question that crosses my mind while I listen to the album is, &quot;I wonder if this is how people first reacted to hearing Sabbath?&quot;<BR>   The sound on here is intense. This is a rock album, no mistakes there, this is a metal album. You like guitars? basses? drums? killer vocals? Thought provoking lyrics? It's all here.<br />   'Lateralus' screams intensity, and beauty. This is their best outing as of yet, and the 5 year wait was well rewarded.
B000002J09|5.0|The fourth album by the legendary Led Zeppelin cemented their status as one of the greatest bands of all time. Robert Plant's voice resonates with syrupy blues (When The Levee Breaks), angelic hymns (Battle Of Evermore, Going To California), heavy metal wails (Black Dog, Rock &amp; Roll), &amp; straightforward rock (Stairway to Heaven). Jimmy Page's talents in his guitar playing is legendary in this album. His work on &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; is inspiring. John Bonham &amp; John Paul Jones supply the strong foundation that made the band great. Bonham's prowess in the drums was legendary. Jones rhythm on the bass provides the backbone for the great songs that Zeppelin produced during their legendary run.<br />LED ZEPPELIN IV is an album that every music lover should own &amp; cherish.
1572522089|5.0|You know, if I hadn't seen this movie and someone told me that it was a Japanified version of King Lear, I would probably scoff at the idea. We all know that &quot;creative remakes&quot; of Shakespeare usually blow big time. But Kurosawa did it so amazingly _well_ here. Sure, it's undeniably King Lear, and most of the characters have clear parallels to the ones in Lear - but it's also undeniably Japanese, steeped in Japanese culture and tradition, and entirely within the bounds of reality of a feudal Japanese society. (Not just because of the amazing costumes, either.)<br />That probably would be just artiness if the actors weren't so good - but they are. Nakadai is amazing as King Lear (or his Japanified counterpart Ichimonji Hidetora) - throughout the movie, we're told that he basically dug his own grave, having murdered thousands of innocent people in his day, but when we see his degraded, outcast state, it's impossible not to pity him. But he's not the only one. The Jester is great - we see his/her (the Jester is rather androgynous) inability to decide whether s/he hates Lear for the monster he was or pities him for the sad old man he's become, and it's really moving. Lady Kaede is chillingly evil, Lord Jiro is a very whipped and defeated man, and Lord Saburo is a rude guy with a heart of gold (and all three are memorable). Jiro's general Lord Kurogane is also amazing - he's on the bad guys' side because of his loyalty to Jiro, but he also is clearly an honorable man - and there will definitely be at least two times in the movie when you will want to loudly root for him.<br />However, probably the most compelling character is Lady Sue. She's presented as your typical &quot;sweet innocent girl&quot; archetype, but she's also very believable. You believe her when she says she is unable to hate Lear (er, Hidetora) for his crimes because after all, everything is decided in our past lives. She has a very small part, but she manages to become the most striking character of all, and her fate is probably the most unbearably tragic point in the entire movie.<br />King Lear is one of Shakespeare's most morose plays; Ran is even gloomier. Despite several light moments (the &quot;fox-head&quot; scene is absolutely hilarious), it's covered in hopelessness through and through. Like in the play, almost everyone dies needlessly, and even though the bad guys die too, they do it too late for you to feel good about it. But it's darker still. The main battle scene (in the first half) is horrifically brutal, but the most disturbing thing about it is that you don't hear the screams of the dying and the gunshots - all you hear is a funeral dirge, leaving the rest up to your imagination. It's really no surprise that Kurosawa had been taking his bitter pills when he was thinking Ran through - he had even made a suicide attempt at one point.<br />One other thing - Ran is almost 3 hours long. Don't let that stop you, though - it's the rare long movie that captivates you from beginning to end with its brilliant acting and directing. It definitely is Kurosawa's finest hour. If you like Japan, Shakespeare, &quot;Shogun,&quot; or King Lear, see it at once. If not, see it anyway. There's nothing anywhere that's quite like it.
B00004Z459|3.0|Mm...I really couldnt even have an opinion on this album. I just wanna make a few things clear. This doesn't sound like Bizkit at all... whoever says they do is on crack. this isnt really that nu-metal. more in a genre of its own. this is like techno-metal with a dash of rap... I personally think the techno metal sounding thing is very cool. its smooth... I cant really describe it. I like their sound. I just think the lyrics are trite and &quot;teenagerish&quot; or whatever. I mean its decent. but its not something to rant and rave about.

0385486804|4.0|I picked this bo ok because I had just read another book from this same author called &quot;Into thin Air&quot; about a tragedy in the Everest Mountain. I liked this other book from him, although I do not understand his critics to the Russian climber, whom to me was a hero in the hole tragedy.<BR> Anyways,in this book I clearly got the feeling of what might have happened to Chris McCandless,as well as to other characters on this book.<BR>  I think sometimes people overvalue superficial things. I personally love to get disconected from the city.<BR> Ive seen many people looking for an answer, a reason to exist, a diferent way of living. Some find it in religion, others travelling constantly. However, the tipical critisism to them will be to catalog them as disfunctional for not accepting the typical american values as their own. Please let live!! (but carefully)<BR> I agree with Chris McCandless in that if you do not accept and dont want to live under so many rules and laws you dont necessarly have to. But then find a way of life that suts you and dont fight the system hiding and living irresponsably.<BR> I guess my only critic to this book is the personal story on the autor s climb to mount McKinley in Alaska. As this book was not about him, this story turned out to be extremly long and detailed.
B00005JKHP|5.0|This is the director's edition of Star Trek the Motion Picture and the first time this movie will be released on  DVD. Now if you think this an average Paramont DVD, YOU ARE WRONG! Given the fact that this is the first  Star Trek motion picture Paramont and the people who work with Star Trek special effects. Decided that this DVD unlike the others is full of extras. One of the extras which is kind of a secret is a cgi model of the enterprise  which will be hidden on the second DVD. Which is somewhat confirmed on the startrek website. These kind of extras are what makes a DVD so cool and is the true explotation of the media and technolgy for this reason you got have this DVD five stars all the way

This cult classic &quot;midnight movie&quot; is being released on DVD for the very first time and it has many special features such as 5 behind-the-scenes featurettes, storyboards, deleted scenes, photo gallery, and a theatrical trailer. I have been a fan of this movie ever since I saw it as a little kid.
B0000027RL|5.0|Evenflow/ Thoughts arrive like butterflies/ Oh he don't know/ So he chases them away/ Someday he'll begin his life again...<br />There's no way you can deny this album the recognition it deserves.  But the beautiful thing is, it's not yearning for publicitiy. It's just there; it's been around, and it has always rocked. Immense talent put together with a voice that is unforgettable.  This is quality. Songs like &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Jeremy&quot; are easily recognizable, but however the other lesser known tracks are just as powerful.  Ballads such as &quot;Oceans&quot;, &quot;Garden,&quot;<BR>and &quot;Release.&quot;  Notice that most of the songs on Ten have no more than one-word titles. The music speaks for itself.
B00005221M|5.0|No film is perfect, but Michael Mann has managed to create a *nearly* perfect one. Despite a few flaws, the movie is romantic without being sappy, action-packed without being mindless, and moving without being contrived. In short, it has cinematic elements for just about everybody.<br />The characters are very real life, although hardly resemble the characters found in the book (which is a good thing, I thought the book was horendous). Daniel Day-Lewis does such a good job as Nathaniel Poe, or Hawkeye, he should have gotten much more recognition. I though Madeleine Stow was very good, although a little wooden (if you watch her other movies, she's like that in all of them, so it just must be her style. Nothing wrong with that!). The best characters, however, were the very three dimensional Uncas and Alice. Their &quot;almost romance&quot; was a little silly, and plays out almost as an afterthough of the producers. Kinda like they all sat around and watched the film and felt sorry for those two backseat characters, and decided to give them some action. Too bad the only other characters of consenting age were each other, because it seems like they're just mimicking Hawkeye and Cora.<br />Well done. Also check out the soundtrack (some people don't like it because bits of it are very Celtic - despite the lack of authentic &quot;Indian&quot; music, I think the Celtic sound adds a lot to the film.) A must see!!
B000002IZ4|5.0|Purple is one of the best albums to emerge out of the alternative epoch, although it is in a class all its own. The musical talent of the DeLeo brothers and Kretz perfectly complement Weiland's hauntingly emotional, seductive voice,which smoothly switches back and forth between mellow and grungy. STP proves to be an extremely versatile band that grows and changes with time, as Purple provides a sharp contrast to its predecessor, Core. Purple contains softer, more emotion-driven tunes yet the alternative undertones are present. (An example is \\"Interstate Love Song.\\") However, there are still faster, more rock-driven tracks such as \\"Meatplow\\" and \\"Unglued.\\" A personal favorite of mine is \\"Still Remains.\\" It's easy to pass on because some of the lyrics are kind of hard to understand upon hearing it the first few times, but I'll give a sample:<br />Drink a song and sing a yellow nectarine/ Take a bath, I'll drink the water that you leave/ If you should die before me ask if you can bring a friend/ Pick a flower hold your breath and drift away...<br />On \\"Kitchenware and Candybars\\", for all you grunge fans out there, you can hear the Vedder in Weiland's voice when he croons \\"What I wanted...\\" This is one of my favorite albums of all time. If you plan on buying any STP albums, get Purple. It's no less than a ... masterpiece, and that's the damned truth.
B000000W6X|4.0|There are lot of interesting songs here, but the album lacks direction. In fact, the songs lead into a terrible closer, &quot;Light My Fire.&quot; The cover features annoying-as-ever vocals by Horace Andy in what may be the worst cover I have ever heard. However, there are still some memorable tracks here. <BR>Karmacoma, Better Things, and Heatmiser remind me of why this album is still so listenable. The Nicolette tracks are decent, but they fail to achieve greatness... there's just something missing.

B000000H3W|5.0|all i can say is that slipknot should thank these guys on every album they do cuz its obvious the influence they had on slipknots music. this cd is pure metal perfection and i do not say that lightly cuz ive heard lots of metal and this ranks up there with pantera and old school fear factory. do not miss this album! at least do yourself a favor and sample it. i doubt you'll be dissapointed
B000002J0B|4.0|Led Zeppelin has recorded many excellent albums.  This is one of their finest creative works.  Personal favorites include the classic &quot;Over The Hills And Far Away&quot;, plus excellent album cuts &quot;The Rain Song&quot;, &quot;Dancing Days&quot;, and the comical &quot;The Crunge&quot;.  All the songs are worthwhile, even for the less-than-hardcore Zep fan.
0380002930|5.0|Simply put, 'Watership Down' is my favorite novel of all time. I have loved it since I was a small child and continue to revisit it every couple of years. Each rereading of the tale of these amazing and 'human' bunnies never fails to move and thrill me.  If you've never read this classic, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy. &quot;Talking rabbits&quot; or not, these are some of the most memorable characters in fiction.
B000002NBY|5.0|This album must contend for my favorite album of the 80s decade. Even after being initially impressed, the songs in this collection continue to grow on me, and though I bought it over ten years ago I still reach for it often. It introduced me to several different music styles, for which I am grateful. Most favorite cuts: &quot;The Boy In The Bubble&quot;, &quot;I Know What I Know&quot;, &quot;Under African Skies&quot;, &quot;Crazy Love&quot;, &quot;That Was Your Mother&quot;, &quot;All Around The World&quot;. But I love the whole disc.
1559408898|4.0|Despite its simplistic and quite-laughable title, Robocop is a wonderful piece of satirical science-fiction. In the Criterion edition, the amount of &quot;excessively violent&quot; added footage amounts to less than a couple of minutes but helps to make the story whole. This violence isn't there just for kicks; it actually fits the overall context of the particular scenes and further defines the story. Despite the MPAA's decision to give the added scenes a rating of &quot;X&quot; (remember, this was in 1987, well before the NC-17 rating existed), I can honestly say that I've seen worse violence in other R-rated films. In any case, the movie is now restored to its entirety and one aspect of Murphy's execution scene suddenly makes a lot more sense. The Criterion edition includes many extras, only a few of which are excellent. Most, however, are for ardent movie fans only. The audio commentary by director Verhoeven, executive producer Jon Davison, and co-writer Neumeier is very interesting but uneven: some passages are quite enlightening while others are awfully banal. The film-to-storyboard comparison is mildly interesting, for once you've seen it, it's enough. The two storyboards showing unfilmed scenes are rather unremarkable novelties, although the cemetary scene would have been a great touch to add in the movie. The illustrated essay on the making of the movie is very lengthy and sometimes overly detailed. The amount of time devoted to the design/production/animation of the ED 209 robot is excessive and goes on ad nauseam. An index feature within this essay would have been helpful because if you exit at any time before reaching the end, you must start all over again. The two trailers are surprising in that they somehow made the movie look like a low-budget snorefest. Fortunately for us, it's exactly the opposite. I would have given 5 stars for the restored movie alone, but some of the Criterion extras being what they are, I subtracted one star. Still worth getting, however.
B000002KHF|5.0|Starting with the admission that I bought this album by &quot;accident&quot; (via a new CD club membership), I will go on to say that my biggest mistake would have been to return it.  Once I played it I understood why it has ranked among the classic  albums for so many years.  Beyond the classic title track, songs like &quot;Come Running&quot;, &quot;These Dreams Of You&quot;, &quot;Everyone&quot; and &quot;Glad Tidings&quot; put a smile on my face and a dance in my feet.  A must for any collection.
B00005A46T|5.0|I'm gonna keep this short and sweet.  This is one the greatest cds i have ever heard.  They are harder then ever, and better then ever.  They're useing all 9 members to fullest,loudest, greatest, etc. potential.  I highly suggest this album to anyone who likes crazy death metal.
B000ICL3C4|5.0|Let's talk about the most underrated Cure record, The Top. Critics have traditionally panned this album (not that that matters), and for many years it was only available in the US as an import. But this album is a quasi-secret gem for fans, and a wonderful historical artifact representing the most insanely prolific and creatively fruitful period in Robert Smith's career.<br /><br />Just glancing over the list of musical accomplishments Smith racked up over the course of a couple of years - two Cure records, two Banshees records, The Glove album with Steve Severin and a slew of fascinating b-sides (to say nothing of all the touring inbetween) - is exhausting. But it's worth keeping in mind while listening to The Top.<br /><br />It's here that Smith finally bridges the gap between the harsh, bleak violence of Pornography and the clean pop whimsy of the Japanese Whispers \\"sell-out\\" singles (which still sound like two different bands), and by blending these seemingly disparate approaches, a whole new persona emerges -- eccentric pop genius/madman. Smith would refine the synthesis to greater effect on The Head on the Door and Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, but the seeds of unlimited musical possibilities are being planted all over this wildly colorful, wonderfully psychotic album.<br /><br />The lurid, roiling fever dream of album opener \\"Shake Dog Shake\\" is followed by the fresh, nylon-string pop of \\"Birdmad Girl\\", which acts as a perfectly-placed palette cleanser (much in the same way \\"Catch\\" did to KMKMKM's acidic opener \\"The Kiss\\"). From there, the album only gets more schizophrenic as Smith's imagination absolutely runs amok in the studio, exploding all over the place. There's the unhinged freak-out of \\"Give Me It\\", the beautifully inscrutable pop of \\"Dressing Up\\". Lone single \\"Caterpillar\\" illustrates how much going \\"pop\\" with stuff like \\"The Lovecats\\" liberated Robert vocally. It's a delightfully odd. quirky and effervescent track, the likes of which only The Cure could manage.<br /><br />As the second half of the album proceeds through the fun-house mirror world of \\"Piggy In The Mirror\\", \\"The Empty World\\" and \\"Bananafishbones\\", a strange cohesion comes into view. The hallucinogenic weirdness never gets out of control; on the contrary, these songs are actually tightly crafted and uniformly melodic across the board (even if some of the lyrics seem bizarre and tossed off) and each song occupies its own special piece of real estate on a kaleidescopically brilliant album.<br /><br />A listen to the remaster through good headphones will reveal all kinds of sonic goodies courtesy of Smith, drummer/percussionist Andy Anderson (and to a lesser degree, the recently demoted ex-drummer Lol Tolhurst). It was easily the most instrumentally rich Cure recording to date, dabbling in multi-cultural musical exotica no doubt influenced by Robert's recent world travels with Siouxsie and company.<br /><br />But the desperate finale (and title track) reminds us how relatively unwell Robert Smith may have indeed been during the druggy, nocturnal process of making of this LP:<br /><br />\\"Please come back<br />Please come back<br />Like all the other ones do<br /><br />Please come back<br />All of you\\"<br /><br />Thankfully, we came back, and so did Robert.d half of the album proceeds through the fun-house mirror world of \\"Piggy In The Mirror\\", \\"The Empty World\\" and \\"Bananafishbones\\", a strange cohesion comes into view.

B00003CXSP|4.0|It has been obvious that the best sequels do not strive to copy the original to perfection but stand alone as seperate, original bodies of work. So, do not watch &quot;Hannibal&quot; expecting an exact equal to the classic &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs.&quot; Like the novel, the movie is another PART of the trilogy started by the novel &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and Michael Mann film &quot;Manhunter.&quot; &quot;Hannibal&quot; is more of an art film, a dark romance that depends on the atmosphere and dialogue. Director Ridley Scott presents a stylish piece of film that is beautifully photographed in rich textures (the photography is by John Mathieson, who was nominated for an Oscar for &quot;Gladiator&quot;) in shadows. There are sequences that look like gothic paintings. There is a dreamy quality here. Much is due to the great team working on this movie. There is Scott, who directed &quot;Gladiator,&quot; the editor is Pietro Scalia who won an Oscar for Oliver Stone's &quot;JFK&quot; and was also nominated for &quot;Gladiator,&quot; and the hauntingly romantic music is by Hans Zimmer, composer of the &quot;Gladiator&quot; score as well. This movie is for people who like perverse horror mingled with artistic taste. &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot; was more about the psychological, gritty aspects of the story, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is about the theatrics. Anthony Hopkins is great as in the first movie, he is charming and engaging. We don't miss Jodie Foster at all and Julianne Moore perfectly captures the character which is a tougher, rougher Clarice Starling made hard as a rock by 10 years of FBI work. The writers of the screenplay, David Mamet (The Edge) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List), do a neat job of capturing the atmosphere of the book. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a dark romance, a more perverse version of Beauty &amp; The Beast. I am disappointed that the ending of the book was left out, nope, Clarice and Hannibal do not run off together. I loved the novel'sending because the author, Thomas Harris, went for broke. What is true horror but the unexpected and unthinkable? I don't understand how Ridley Scott is willing to film the top of a man's head cut off, revealing a red brain underneath, bowels spewing onto the floor, but left out the original ending. I suspect it's because there is a sequel in order. Still, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a gothic, atmospheric movie. It is not the classic that &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot; is, but it is an original, artistic thriller. A certain, unique taste is needed to enjoy this one. You probably have to read the book to really get it, but it is fine filmmaking.
B0000027RL|4.0|This is a pretty good CD. Buy it.
B000056NX4|4.0|I first came across this video when my mom brought it home from the local library for us to view it.  Since I had no idea that this version was out, I believed she'd brought home the 1973 version (which I'd seen years before but didn't really want to see again), and didn't believe that it was a newer version.  The first images not only made me realize this wasn't the 1973 version; it also glued me to the edge of my seat!<br />What is it about Gale Edward's production that makes it so much better than the 1973 production?  Maybe I should begin with the acting and singing, as that's what I first noticed.  First on the parade is Jerome Pradon as the infamous Judas Iscariot.  Pradon certainly enabled me to understand and even at times sympathize with Judas's situation (no small feat, considering Judas is all too often reviled by many, including myself).  I'm pretty certain I saw Judas witnessing the Roman guards drag off a Jew; and if I'm right in that, it certainly makes his fears as expressed in &quot;Heaven on their Minds&quot; understandable.<br />But he's not the only fine actor or singer.  Glenn Carter's Jesus was certainly not passive -- just listen to him in the &quot;Simon Zealotes/Poor Jerusalem&quot; sequence if you don't believe me!  He's not a bad singer, either.  Renee Castle as Mary Magdalene was also very good.  Whether you agree with the interpretation of her as being in love with Jesus or not, she certainly makes it believable, adding more fuel to Judas's fears about Jesus's losing control over the masses in the process.  And speaking of Simon Zealotes, Tony Vincent was brilliant as the revolutionary follower of Jesus; Frederick B. Owens and Michael Shaeffer brought great singing power to Caiaphas and Annas; and Rik Mayall made a hilarious King Herod as nightclub entertainer.  In fact, my mom said there wasn't a bad actor/singer in the bunch, and I tend to agree.<br />The staging also got high points for me (it would be awful in a cinematic film, but as it's made for video, that point doesn't matter), since it's a (usually) successful modernization of the musical.  However, I will say that the &quot;Superstar&quot; segment was my least favorite part, although I don't know if that was because it was too garish or just so painful to watch.<br />Ultimately, however, I'd say the reason I was glued to the edge of my seat was because it was so passionate, and for that reason, the last parts of the film were painful for both me and my mom (as I suspect it was intended to be).  So I'd say the passion behind the actors and behind Gale Edward's direction is why I found this version of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; an arresting production!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This whole movie has such an incredible look to it, very stylistic. I haven't seen any other movies that David Fincher has directed, but judging from this I'd have to say that he's awesome. The movie has some differences than the book, nothing too big. A lot of the dialogue is almost directly from the book. There are a few tracks of commentary, including Chuck Palahniuk and the main stars and those are interesting to listen to. Some of the behind-the-scenes features are amusing and I'm so glad that make-up features, costume sketches and multi angles are included.<br /> I'm a big fan of the movie so I guess I'm a bit biased, but I do think that the actors are amazing, and the plot is just so wonderfully twisted that I can't see how someone couldn't enjoy this movie. Make soap!
B00005MEPV|5.0|Yes there was a plot, a story, and good acting in The Phantom Menace; more ever, it was not just a F/X film! I have read some funny things in how the Fanboys express their limited opinion about The Phantom Menace. I find it my job to add my rebuttal to their case, and defend a movie saga that I love. <br />I cannot see how a film that can be so bad, that it end up making over 430 million dollars at the Box Office here in the U.S.? One would have to conclude that there are far less nay sayers, and that they are very vocal about their hatred for a good film. I am sure these are the people that would say: &quot;The Matrix was a better movie.&quot; If that were true, would it have made more money than The Phantom Menace? Thus showing that the Fanboys are out numbered, in their idea that The Phantom Menace was a bad movie!<br />So, why was Jar Jar put into the movie? Well if you watched it, you will understand that they needed Jar Jar to bring the Gungans, and the people of Theed together. So, they can fight the trade federation in the end. Also, unless you don't have kids of your own(and fanboys don't); it would be hard to understand the enjoyment they have watching Jar Jar. So please put your own selfishness aside, and let kids enjoy a character that does have a purpose in the Star Wars Universe! Unlike some people I did enjoy Jar Jar, and looking forward to see him in EP II:)<br />Now people what do you really want from a 9 year old? Is life so bad for you fanboys, that your going to base a whole movie on a kid that acts like a 9 year old? LOL.. How pathetic can you get? Is it so hard to see, or even look at the idea of loss of innocents? Can you not see a boy that is full of hope, and dreams of doing good for everybody one day; just to see all that strip away in the end. Can you not see the power, or even the sadness behind that? So, I found it very powerful to show this, the glory before the fall. Also I did find Jack Lloyd playing as Anakin Skywalker good, and delivered his lines very well. <br />I did found The Phantom Menace on par with the rest of the Star Wars saga; further more, it is refreshing that it did not copy everything that the first three movies did! This is a new Trilogy, with a new direction that will connect with the original trilogy in the end. <br />So, please don't let people try to talk you into not getting or buying this movie! Find our for yourself, please:) Than make your opinion known, I am sure you will enjoy this movie. <br />The Phantom Menace is a great movie, like the rest of the Star Wars Saga. It is different from the rest, because it is NEW story that needs to be different from the first Trilogy! Would you like watching the same story again? I know I would not:)<br />I am happy to see that we are going to get this on DVD now. I have been waiting forever to get a Star Wars Movie on DVD. It would seem we are going to have to wait for another 4 to 6 years to get the whole saga on DVD, and I'll be there to buy them when they do:)<br />p.s. if the fanboys only complaint about the movie is two characters, and the titles of the movie. I say we are in pretty good shape! Let them complain, while we enjoy a great movie over and over again; more ever, enjoy The Phantom Menace for what it is... ENTERTANMENT:-)
B000002H6C|5.0|I knew Metallica was good, I was just unsure of what album to buy first. My cousin reccomended me this. I was blown away. It was over 2 years before i took it out of my cd player. This is Metallica at their best. Their songs have provocative, thought full lyrics, and amazing guitar work. The CD also contains my personal favorite song, One. This song starts slow, and gradually increases its speed. It talks about a war veteran who lost his sight, hearing, speech, arms, and legs in a war. If you do not own this album, go out right now and buy buy buy buy buy!!!!
B000021Y77|5.0|Every now and than you'll find a movie that you cannot get out of your mind, and Run Lola Run is one of them. It is one of the fastest 81 min. movie I  sat through. <br />There are a few movies that will hit you right, and Run Lola Run had me jumping up, dancing, and yelling at the T.V. needless to say that this movie did hit me right...LOL!! I thought the acting, sound ( please view it in German, the english track is off), music ( get the sound track it is incredible), editing, and picture were all good.  <br />Because of this film, I have become a fan of Tom Tykwer, and the lovely Franka Potente. Tom Tykwer is a interesting directer. After I seen this movie, I went out and found the only other movie I can get by him called: Winter Sleepers. By far is was nothing like Run Lola Run, but is shows that he can do fast action movies as well as slow moving movies. Winter Sleepers is good for its kind of movie, I really enjoyed it; but not as much as Run Lola Run. I only wish I could see his other movie The Princess and the Warrior, but I guess I have to wait for that on dvd as well. Franka Potente, what a catch! She can act, sing, and speek three to four languages...WOW!! I have been finding movies she has been playing in, and buying them! I cannot wait to get Blow, I believe that is her first English speeking movie. Do I have to say she was Great in Run Lola Run? YES, She was just wonderfull in it. I cannot wait to see it again here soon, however, I just have one complaint about the movie. <br />The only thing I didn't like about the dvd: &quot;why did they copy the movie on both sides of the disk?&quot; May be they did not know how at the time to print both stander, and widescreen on the same side at the time. I just cannot stand having dvd's with both sides printed on it.  <br />Anyways<br />I only wish I watched this movie when it came out, but now that I have. I would very much like other people see this movie, because Run Lola Run is a great movie to see again andagain. Please pick up this movie, you'll love it.
6305878323|5.0|&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; remains the ultimate Disney musical that both entertains and, in a lighthearted tone, sends a sweet message to children and grown-ups alike. This might sound melodramatic, but anybody who has gotten so deep into the &quot;9 to 5&quot; work routine to the point that they miss the &quot;here and now&quot; could totally relate to this fine work!<br />Such a passionate statement rings true in almost any age; &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a wake-up call, a scathing assault on the mindless conformity that runs rampant in any modern society. I can't hum &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; without also thinking &quot;Protagasubterfugerist et antiphlogistic!&quot; Cheery tunes about nonsensical words indeed mix with angry Greek slogans demanding that the apathetic sloth we call society be energized with the inflammation that is the rising public anger latent in a hollowed culture.<br />Credit for the swift delivery of prosaic force that drives home this angry attack on modern corporate society should go to director Robert Stevenson, who directed many popular Disney films. &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is a departure for Stevenson; unlike his &quot;nuclear family&quot; hits like &quot;Son of Flubber,&quot; this body of work reveals a brave soul letting out a Guajardian cry for help. This is most abundant in the melodic tune of discontent disguised as joy &quot;I Love To Laugh,&quot; a symbolic parody revealing that laughing at jokes rife with dark humor spears our souls with a hallucinatory effect, delivering us to heights we may never return from, all while the impoverished starve and the farm animals sicken in the fields. Guajardian musical lyrics have never been better!<br />I can't help but believe this film was a cathartic exercise for Stevenson. Unlike his feelgood movies, this is a focused and consistent work. There is only one other Robert Stevenson film I can think of where he seems to cut deep with his personal creative punch. That 1971work parallels &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; with its upbeat sardonic songs, but also effectively utilizes surreal gothic imagery, chilling Wiccan chants and disturbing apocalyptic overtones. And while that particular film, &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks,&quot; delivers an almost Warholian assault on fascism, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; reigns proudly as the pinochle of Robert Stevenson's body of work.
B00005A46T|1.0|Dont get me wrong, im a fan of hardcore music.  However, i just find Slipknot, and this album &quot;Iowa&quot; especially, to be unnecessary noise, and the only reason it sells is because their idiotic masks and unusual # of band members is something a lot of idiots out there will buy.  Terrible, try some System of a Down or Disturbed.
6304711905|5.0|Tombstone is fast paced, fun, and packed with quality acting/writing. Historically padded, but who cares. Pure entertainment.<br />A must see. Val Kilmer is phenominal, shooting at OK Coral is amazing. You will love Doc Holiday. Buy it.
B00005221L|2.0|High marks for the movie which I really like, but the quality of this DVD was poor! The DTS sound was awesome but the print used on this DVD was of very poor quality with nicks, scratches and hairs, dirt marks...it looked like it had not been cleaned. This I would expect from a Good Time video but not from Fox. The DVD opened with a spiel on how wonderful Fox videos are with fancy menus, extra features, etc. All this DVD offered was a still photo menu and a trailer. Very disappointing for a Fox video. I hope they'll re-release it with a good quality print and again with DTS.
B00005JK93|5.0|I see a light on the horizon. A light that I have not seen in a long time. And that light, my friends is the genre of Movie Musicals. Finally after almost a 10 year dormancy. the genre is coming back and this movie is one of the best movie musicals I've seen in a long time. Based on one of the most risque Off-broadway musicals, This production was adapted, directed, and even starring John Cameron Mitchell one of the shows original creators. Mitchell has managed to adapt his work with seeming ease. The camera working is colorful, energetic, and intense. It doesn't miss any of the important details, and manages to make every scene a unique experience.<br />The Story goes like this...<BR>Hansel, a homosexal, east german boy, is eager to escape the opressive atmosphere of East Germany. One day he meets a soldier. They want to get married and escape to America. But unfortunately Hansel needs a sex change operation. The operation is botched, leaving him with the so called &quot;Angry Inch&quot;. well upon arrival in Kansas. The now titled &quot;Hedwig&quot; is abandoned by his husband. Well soon afterwards we follow Hedwig's turbulent rise to glory as a rock star.<br />Mitchell's work on this film is truly visionary, as well as original, striking, moving, and brilliant. You don't often see a film that will mercilessly tell a story with such sensitive subject matter. While at the same time dare to make a film from a genre that most cinematic ignoramuses think is dead and gone. WELL Guess what you pathetic &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; fans. Your immature flatulence jokes will never reign as long as there are independent filmmakers, daring to make films that the neutered Hollywood Studios wouldn't dare to touch! <br />Do yourself a favor, forget the multiplexes, go find yourself a small independent film theatre and see this exciting and inventive movie musical!!! Be sides, it's not like Hollywood has the gall to make anything original.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made.  i would strongly recommend it to anyone.

B00003CXS4|1.0|My friends and I were really disappointed with this movie. Ok. We really hated it and we all wished we would've walked out at the beginning. It was so boring. And so nasty. And lol just like completely dumb. We laughed once in a while, ok maybe you wanna say it was over our heads- but we wanna say it's the worst movie we've ever seen and we don't think anybody should see it although for some reason you ppl gave it a million good reviews. You don't have to listen to me- i mean techinically i'm not old enough to watch it anyways, but I just wanted to say what I thought.
6304675348|5.0|A brilliant mad slasher movie which breaks all the rules of a mad slasher movie.  You'll never guess who's killing everybody, and the plot twists don't stop.
B00005A46T|5.0|... The minute I put in the cd and heard the second track People=Sh t, I knew this cd would kick. It is a definately better than the self-titled release. It is much heavier and the guitars are much better. You can also hear the bass more. Paul does a great job. The lyrics are more hateful, \\"You touch me I'll rip you apart.\\" They did the 2 re-recorded tracks,Gently and Iowa, from a different angle. The original Gentle was more acoustic and softer. The new Gentle is just freaky. Iowa wasn't done so well. The original was much more deeper. At the end of Iowa, Sid kicks in and screws up the mood of the song with annoying scratches.

This features all of the songs you might've heard and loved - &quot;Building a Mystery&quot;, &quot;Ice Cream&quot;, and etc. - plus the awesome &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; and other greats!  There's not a bad song on the CD.

B000002BQK|5.0|I know many people have complain that Carey 'lost it'with this album; citing the lack of &quot;Hero&quot;-styled ballads, etc...but the truth is, this is who she really is and musically, the material here is personal, deep and at times moving (case-in-point; Butterfly).<br />How good or bad, it's subjective but i think the whole hip-hop with rap stars and some sentimental ballads really puts Carey ahead of the competition. Her voice, often the saving grace on the weak tracks and the spectacular star of the stronger ones, are definitely put to good effect here, whether you call it oversinging or whatever; you can't deny the Carey trademark vocals.<br />Best of all, this was released in 1997, a pretty poignant year and this was the start of the more-human side of Carey instead of the made-up picture-perfect celebrity that we used to know.
B00003CXTG|4.0|When was the last time you went to a Cineplex to see a documentary?  I'm guessing you never did.  In turn, no one should take a movie seriously as far as historical facts go.  A movie should be seen for what it is, a movie, entertainment.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  The fact that this one centers around the battle of Pearl Harbor is just a set piece.  Braveheart, an excellent, Oscar winning movie, had more historical inaccuracies then Pearl Harbor, but everyone accepted it.  The problem was the hype.  Media is to blame for the tremendous hype of this movie and in turn it raises expectations.  I kept my expectations low and I was not disappointed.  Not that keeping low expectations was the only way to enjoy this movie though.  Pearl Harbor has heart and it goes for the bravado throughout the movie.  It begins with the childhood friendship of two main characters, eventually played by Harnett and Affleck when they are shown as young men.  Both are pilots in the Army.  This is a time when displays of patriotism and courage were more important then your welfare, and men gladly died fighting for their country.  The two young men are more then anxious to fight, Afflecks character in particular who has Dyslexia (although back then it was fairly unknown) has to charm his way through the medical exam, being given by Beckinsale.  The pilot and young nurse start a romance that is very strong, Affleck and Beckinsale surprisingly have tremendous chemistry together, and the innocent yearning for one another is very apparent.  Affleck's character is then offered a chance to fight in England.  He accepts and as he goes into dogfights over the war torn battlefields of England, an inevitable tragedy happens.  To say anymore might ruin some of the story.  What follows is sadness at the loss of a friend, new romance, a surprise scene where we learn that Affleck's character is not dead (although we all saw it coming), then the scene that everyone is waiting for; the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The initial setup of the love story is pleasantly appealing, it is humorous, sweet, endearing and never too sappy.  It is well paced and does not get boring.  In my own opinion, Michael Bay is a very skilled director.  He has the makings of another James Cameron but something is still missing from his process.  He is a perfectionist as well, but Cameron has him beat hands down when it comes to balancing a love a story with hard core action.  Bay still does a very fine job here though.  He handles the love story with enough emotion and then throws us into the thick of this tremendous battle scene.  Not enough can be said about this scene.  Bay pulls out all the stops and makes sure we realize the scope of the power and destruction that was rained on this island base burns into our memory.  The camera that follows the bomb from the sky and into the bulkhead of the Arizona, followed by its eventual explosion as it lifts off the surface of the water is spectacular and frightening.  The long battle scene never lets up.  It keeps going until we feel as exhausted as the soldiers who suffered through it.  After this comes reconciliation of sorts.  Affleck and Harnett's characters have to get over certain personal issues.  The raid on Tokyo follows, with Baldwin playing Jimmy Doolittle (and he plays it well), the hard core army pilot who leads the bombing.  The wrap up is emotional, there is not a customary happy ending.  It isn't a shock, but it plays well against the backdrop of the war, and the love story that has played out in front of it.  The Japanese are not portrayed poorly, they are seen as people in a desperate situation.  The Americans at the time had cut off many of their resources.  The bombing was a last resort and the Japanese are depicted as hesitant to awake the sleeping American giant, especially the Japanese General who coordinated the attack due to the fact that he was educated in America and knows what they are capable of.  The reasons for the attack are stated and justified (at least by standards of war).  The statements made by Franklin D Roosevelt are inspiring and well portrayed by Jon Voight, still a great actor and hardly recognizable in the makeup.  He brings fire to the role of FDR and makes it known that he is the President at all times.  Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the black cook on board one of the ships that was attacked and plays his role for everything it has, seeing as it is such a small role.  He plays a real life Navy cook who took up an anti aircraft gun and shot down one of the Japanese planes.  Some may say his role was short and not necessary to the movie, but I disagree.  He was a man who took up the fight when the country wouldn't let him.  Instead of showing bitterness, he displayed his patriotism for a country that scorned him.  In that he shows that the fight to save lives became more important at the time then the bigotry of the country he was fighting for.  When all that this movie has to say has finally been said and done, we should know that history should not be learned from a movie, and even though Pearl Harbor has only a few inconsistencies in it's historical portrayal, the interest it may spark should lead people to look up the actual events in legitimate historical archives, or to watch The History Channel, to get the real facts.  In all, the movie fully deserves four stars.  Michael Bay made a tremendous effort here to show what he can handle as far the content of a movie and he succeeded on many levels.  I give it four stars only because there is still something missing that keeps this movie from being exceptional.  However, it is a very good movie and I would sincerely give it my recommendation.
0375703861|5.0|I have pondered but not penetrated the meaning behind the constant teeth reference in Zadie Smith's debut novel. Notwithstanding, what we have in &quot;White Teeth&quot; is an impressive and stunningly mature piece of work from a precocious new talent who writes likes she's already lived a hundred years, ingested the entire social and cultural history of mankind and applied those influences to create a wonderfully fresh new novel about multigenerational conflicts within immigrant families in England. There are even touches of the great Rushdie in this hilarious yet absorbing and relevant tale of racial, sexual, social and cultural confusion that now pervades the proverbial &quot;green and pleasant land&quot;.  There are many rivers and tributaries feeding into the soil of multicultural England. East Indians (Pakistan), West Indians (Jamaicans), you name them, they're there. What's fascinating about this explosion of influences coming from all sides including the host culture is the capacity they create for the unexpected.  Nothing is what they seem. The wilful retreat of Samad into eastern conservatism, the clear eyed revolt of his wife, Alsana, who wishes to annihilate all references to her own motherland, the opposite natures of their twin boys, Magid and Millat, and the mindboggling paths they took towards their destinies, etc is the stuff of great fiction. I also loved the characterisation of the obsessive Chalfens, whose eccentricity is uniquely English.  Joyce is an absolute scream. The novel just builds and builds.  It never flags and indeed ends on a big note. Smith's language is quite simply dazzling but also occasionally overworked. That's when you develop a mild headache but it's a small criticism. &quot;White Teeth&quot; is such a massively enjoyable piece of fiction it will entrance readers for years to come. The second novel will be the big test but if Zadie Smith continues to produce novels of this quality and standard, she will soon find herself ensconced among the pantheon of great contemporary writers.  Believe the hype. This novel is epic in breadth and sweep. Don't miss it. For once, the critics got it right.
0671024256|4.0|I read &quot;Carrie&quot; when I was seventeen years old and then did not read anything by Stephen King for the next twenty-five years. Somewhere along the line, I decided that since King was popular, his books must be poorly written. Also, the genre put me off. I don't know why I decided to read &quot;On Writing&quot;, but I did, and I am certainly happy I made that decision.<BR>As other reviewers noted, the book is actually two books, an autobiography and a manual on writing. This marriage is not as uneasy as it would seem. The experiences of Stephen King define why he writes what he does -- and that is a question many of us have asked over the years -- and the manual describes how he does it.<BR>How does he do it? Read, read, read, write, write, write. Focus on characters, not plot, and ask yourself continually, if I were in this situation, what would I do? Make your characters, their motivations and their actions, consistent.<BR>I don't know if it would work for all aspiring writers, but it is certainly practical, workmanlike advice. I liked King's humorous tone, too. I think I may pick some of those King books I've missed during the past twenty-five years.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Overwhelming in its ambition and far ranging in its scope, Steven Soderberghs eye-opening and mind-expanding Traffic comes as close to being a masterpiece as any American film in a long, long time.  Indeed, it reminds us of why we fell in love with movies in the first place.  Here is a film that finds not only the courage to grapple with a major social issue, but the artistry necessary to illuminate it.<br />Traffics greatest virtue lies in the nonlinear nature of its dramatic structure.  This allows director Soderburgh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan to weave a complex tapestry of characters and plot elements, permitting us to see the issue from a myriad of different angles.  The result is nothing less than an epic survey of the drug war as it has come to be waged in the homes and streets of our cities and towns all around the world.  Traffic is not content to provide a simplistic moral lesson, as so many socially conscious films are wont to do.  Instead, it tries to provide as honest and comprehensive a view of the subject as is conceivably possible, concentrating on the depressing futility and murky morality that exist on both sides of the war.<br />In its panoramic survey of the issue, Traffic looks at characters from all levels of the social strata, from the users to the sellers, from high government officials in charge of bringing an end to drug trafficking to the corrupt leaders of the drug cartels who live to ensure its continuance, from parents, spouses and friends caught up in the tragic effect of the drug world to soldiers on the front line who come to question the validity of their life cause. Traffic seems to be suggesting that, in the war on drugs, it is we, as a society, who are the ultimate losers.  Even those of us who never use drugs are inadvertently affected by the problem.<br />Traffic spares no one, yet, at the same time, it offers shreds of compassion to any number of the characters caught in the vicious cycle.  Caroline Wakefield is, in many ways, a typical adolescent: pretty, bright and strangely drawn to what she feels is harmless experimentation with drugs, unaware of the consequences of her usage not only to herself but to society as a whole as she becomes a small but intricate part of the whole vast problem.  Her father, Judge Robert Hudson Wakefield, who also just happens to have been appointed the nations new drug czar, is a fairly typical modern parent as well.  Here is a man so dedicated to the advancement of his own career that, despite his love for his daughter, he has begun to reap the tragic effects that come with parental neglect.  As played by Michael Douglas, Wakefield is a good solid man honestly confused by the fact that the very problem he is dedicating his life to eradicating on a global scale is occurring right in his own backyard  and, like most concerned parents, he hasnt a clue how to deal with it.  Suddenly, all the clever slogans, buzz words and shibboleths that he has used to deal with this issue on the official level become meaningless in the context of his own personal crisis. His wife, Barbara (Amy Irving), faces the problem like many good parents who have themselves tried drugs in their youth, not wanting to blow the issue out of proportion, thereby providing little in the way of moral direction for her child.<br />Traffic is filled with innumerable other complex characters as well.  In his Oscar-winning performance, Benicio Del Toro plays Officer Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, a corrupt Tijuana policeman who must decide which side of the law enforcement fence he will ultimately end up on.  Don Cheadle appears as Montel Gordon, a DEA agent who finds himself dedicating his life to a cause he may no longer believe in.  And Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Helena Ayala, a young wife and mother who receives a rude awakening as to the true character of her wealthy husband when he is suddenly arrested for drug dealing.  Each of these characters becomes an intricate part of the big picture and contributes, in his or her own way, to the moral ambiguity and complexity that distinguish this fine film.<br />In addition to all the brilliant performances, Traffic is distinguished by superb directing, cinematography, editing and scoring.  As both director and cinematographer, Soderbergh reveals a fine eye for texture, relying on a variety of color filters to root each scene in its own particular milieu.  Stephen Mirriones tightly-knit, award-winning editing keeps this sprawling tale from unraveling and Brian Eno and Cliff Martinez create a haunting, otherworldly quality to the film with their richly somber musical score.<br />One would be hard pressed to explain exactly WHY Traffic did not win the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2000.  It was certainly the finest film of the five that were nominated.  Whatever the reason, Traffic is a film that will live in the hearts and minds of those who have seen it for a long, long time.  It renews ones faith in the artistic possibilities of the American cinema  a faith that has been undergoing a large number of tests and trials in the past several years.

0448060191|5.0|I'm so glad to see that the cover and illustrations for the hardback version of LITTLE WOMEN have stayed the same; this book (along with Frances Hodgson Burnett's A LITTLE PRINCESS) were staples of bedtime reading when I was growing up, and as I became an avid reader on my own later on, LITTLE WOMEN revealed more layers to me. Some people think of it as old fashioned, when actually the novel was considered unconventional in its time, focusing as it does on what is -- for the first half of the book, anyway -- a single parent home made up entirely of women. The girls in this story are DOERS, and their lack of funds don't hold them back from attempting things. (In fact, it pushes them to be imaginative, as when Jo ruins her gloves with lemonade and can't go to a dance, so Meg lends her one of her own clean ones to wear and they both carry a stained one. Genius, Meg.) The second half of the story, especially, has scenes of tender drama, which is one of the reasons the material has been adapted to the screen so successfully and repeatedly over the years. (Was there a dry eye in the house when Winona Ryder came across Claire Dane's dusty childhood trunk in the attic and ran her hands across it?) The bond that the March sisters share is extremely moving, and like all good drama, it's based in recognizable human emotion. I've always been at sea when my gay friends report that they've &quot;come out&quot; to their brothers or sisters. Aren't siblings the people you walked to school with for years, the people whose diaries you shared or broke into, the people you ran away from home with for an afternoon? How could they not know you to begin with? LITTLE WOMEN is primarily about that bond, and it's a great, malleable dramatic subject.
B00005A46T|1.0|First thing is first. I need to let it be known that Slipknot is the corniest bunch of sideshow phonies ever. Why must the band go around in masks and little halloween costumes. No are no less intimdating to me then Linkin Park, or N' Sync. I hold them all on the same level as the rest of this horrible pop culture. There is nothing new about Slipknot other then thier horrible inablility to play well live, and there lack of musical talent, except for Joey the drummer since he is the only member with any musical aspiration in the band anyway. Well look before you shout Slipknot is the best band or buy this CD take time to listen to someone more powerful with more musical and artistic depth. Maybe if you are looking for something with some true emotions try Neurosis, or if you want to listen to some real metal try Nevermore or ICED EARTH. There is much more to music then the meaningless antics of SLipknot.
B00003CXSM|3.0|An easy to watch - no concentration needed movie that will allow you to pass time.  Things would have been acceptably okay had it not been for the cheesy - predictable ending.  I personally think it would have made a slight impact to the audience if Mary married Massimo &amp; not Steve.  There, just saving you your money in case you haven't seen it yet.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill is brilliant. She is so talented- she can sing, rap, and write music better than anyone I have ever heard. Some of the high points on the CD are &quot;To Zion&quot;- a beautiful ballad written for her son; &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot;- a great rap song that makes you want to get up and dance; &quot;Forgive them Father,&quot; A song with a great beat and awesome lyrics, it also has a great message; &quot;Every Ghetto, Every City,&quot; A favorite song of mine with a great beat and amazing lyrics; &quot;Everything is Everything&quot; a song with a great bass line and brilliant lyrics. Overall, this CD is amazing and every song is great. It is definetly more than worth it to buy.
B00004Z459|5.0|I luv every track on it! They're so good! I downloaded four of their songs off WinMX and luved those, and all my friends were saying that the CD was really good and that I should buy it. Well I bought it today, and I have to say this is probably my favorite CD. Their songs have really great beats, and no, they aren't like Limp or KoRn. They're somethin' different. It's like rock/techno, and it's an eargasmic experience. I just listened to every track on their CD and now I'm going to listen to them all over again. What a great CD!
B0000214F0|3.0|I do own this, and although I find the sex and particularly the violence realistically graphic to the time and manner of Rome at this juncture in her time, I find alot of the acting just plain sucks. The great O'Toole, Gielgud and even Mirren are all around for alittle time only. We see much more of Malcolm of course, and though he plays &quot;mad&quot; well enough, it gets alittle boring and over-the-top. And when he mourns his sister's death, I simply fastforward away from THAT. Otherwise, to quote a (female) friend, &quot;There are images in it that are burned in my brain forever...&quot;
B00004R99I|5.0|Walt Disney's &quot;Pocahontas&quot; could never be used in any classroom as a depiction of textbook history. But it is a tale of people learning to overcome their personal prejudices, and to enjoy the beauty of nature without always letting civilization take over. It offers the viewers a tale of adventure, greed, heartbreak, tradition, and sacrifice.<BR> What impresses me about the way many cartoon movie characters are drawn is the accuracy in capturing the features of the actors who give them their voices. Captain John Smith looks and moves like Mel Gibson (with the exception of the blond hair), with his classic features captured to perfection; Pocahontas looks like Irene Bedard, Powhatan like Russell Means, Grandmother Willow like Linda Hunt, Thomas like Christian Bale, etc.<BR>   The musical score is intense, as is the final confrontation between the English and the Native Americans. Judy Kuhn's rendering of &quot;The Colors of the Wind&quot; is very uplifting . When I had a chance to view the edited version of &quot;If I Never Knew You&quot;, I realized that Gibson's singing has potential; with a little training, he could handle the range of either Al Martino or Robert Goulet.-- I wouldn't write him off completely as a singer even though he does leave something to be desired there.<BR> David Ogden Stiers, is reprising his role on M.A.S.H. in a different medium as the snooty Radcliffe.<BR>  The woodland cuties, Flit, and Meeko,and the bulldog, Percy continue the Disney tradition of giving the main characters a few animal sidekicks. The ending where a wounded John Smith literally beams at the site of the reconciliation among the animals is a delightful one.<BR>  I would recommend this benevolent, politically correct tale to children of all ages. The younger ones can always deal with historical accuracy later.
0783211856|1.0|Do not misunderstand me: I neither like what the N-Socialists did to the Jews, nor do I care for the decades of the world pointing its finger at Germany (or holding its hand open for cash...).<br />But - if Spielberg wanted to make a movie about how bad the Jews are treated in this world - why does he trample on Germany´s AND the majority of Europe´s nerves for a war that´s almost 60 years gone now?<br />If he wants to pull the world on his side, why doesn´t he make a movie about the Muslin terrorists bombing Israel to pieces - instead of criticising the long obsolete Facisism?<BR>Why doesn´t he make a movie about Israely soldiers defending their country and families - instead of reawakening the slaughter of Omaha Beach and wasting German soldiers defending THEIR country?<br />I still think that Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all times, but it definitely is time for him to come back to what he does best: bringing fantasy, heroes, and sci-fi into the cinema like nobody else does.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Since I don't know how to start this review, I guess I'll start with the plot. When a space ship carrying 40 civilians (including a convict) crashes on a planet that's very hot and has three suns, the survivors of the crash have to find a way to survive without food or water. But then they encounter strange creatures that have a hungry appetite for flesh and only come out at night. And then there is an eclipse<br />Vin Disel stars in the suspense/horror/science fiction blockbuster (in my book, anyway) along with Radah Mitchell and Keith David.<br />First, the good things: The special effects are great as well as the acting. The movie isn't exactly scary but it's very entertaining. There are some good one-liners, and the ending is great.<br />Bad things: It takes a while to get in to the meat of the movie. Although it starts with a huge crash, the movie doesn't pick up the pace until more than an hour in to the film. (and the film in 1 hr. and 48 minutes long) Intead, the first half is about character development and the second half picks up on the creatures. <br />DVD: I expected more special features. The 4 minute featurette isn't very good, but the commentary with the director, Vin Disel, and Cole Hauser is the meat of the special features. The other commentary is OK. The 3 minutes of restored footage add to the 1st half of the movie (character development) and the production notes are an intersting but quick read. <br />All in all: Good movie but was a little slow on pacing. I recommend you rent it before buying it.<br />1999; 112 minutes; Contains strong language, some scenes with intense violence, sensuality, and drug use.
B00005LKIM|4.0|I almost did not watch this film because of the reviews and gore factor. However, I did not find it as gruesome as expected, and I watched it twice in 24 hours. During the second viewing there were a couple of scenes I chose not to watch again. I found this film quite riveting, although for different reasons than &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. In &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; I found Dr. Lector to be more of a monster whom indiscriminately killed his victims. However, the story line was unpredictable and challenging at times. However, in &quot;Hannibal&quot; Dr. Lector's own psychology is made clearer, his contempt for the rude and corruptible, and his respect for the incorruptible. I found myself actually liking Dr. Lecter, although still a monster. And the people he killed were rather unpleasant individuals and, surprisingly (shamefully), I found myself not bothered by their demise. Which demonstrates the magnetising effect Anthony Hopkins has in this role. I felt Clarice's character was quite realistic following her experiences in the FBI, and I found myself understanding her plight and respecting her incorruptibility. The story line was not really challenging, but the film was interesting and entertaining.
0553266306|5.0|I have read the novel several times and have seen the film version several times.Both are excellent. It is a real tour de force that Forsythe makes irrelevant the fact that we know that De Gaulle was not assassinated. The pace is so fast and the storyline so gripping that we are carried along by the thrill of what happens to the exclusion of the fact that De Gaulle will survive. The detail of the preparation for the kill is credible and superbly researched. In particular the novel details for the first time, as far as I'm aware, the best method of applying for a passport in a false name, something with which the Jackal is all too familiar. You enter easily into his world and yet you never really know who he is, even his nationality. His anonymity is attractive. A personal point of interest is that I spotted an error in the text that has persisted since the book's original publication in 1971 but should be corrected since I have pointed it out to the current publishers. It's a really freudian slip in chapter 18 when instead of asking about the &quot;make and number&quot; of the car Lebel actually asks about the &quot;make and murder&quot; of the car. Strangely enough the italian translation of the novel corrects the mistake. I was curious to know if Forsythe had made the mistake in the original text, particularly if he had handwritten the original. The publisher did not forward my question to the author or give me an e-mail address to correspond with him. If anyone knows it I'd be grateful.<br />This novel must rank as one of the greatest thrillers of modern times. I highly recommend it to those who enjoy thrillers.
0871137380|4.0|Bowden's book reminds us how messy and horrific war is, even<br />in the modern era of smart weapons, smart tactics, and overwhelming US superiority.

0679720200|4.0|In 'The Stranger', we are taken through the daily events<BR>of a seemingly ordinary man leading up to and following<BR>his senseless murder of an Arab, over a domestic dispute<BR>concerning his 'pal', Raymond. The novel is essentially<BR>a character study from an existentialist viewpoint. The <BR>anti-hero, Meursault, is a man of no convictions who is not<BR>driven by passion, money, or love.. but by the simple desire <BR>to get by, day to day. The murder of the Arab was senseless, and<BR>he knows it, but does not feel particularly remorseful. When his<BR>mother dies, he is apathetic. Meursault felt, from day<BR>to day, the way all of us have felt at times. His nihilistic<BR>attitute, while repulsive to many, has a cold and inescapable<BR>logic. In the end, death is inevitable. It will claim us all,<BR>no matter how much we cling to life. It is this fact that makes<BR>our lives and the frantic scrambling for happiness absurd. There<BR>is no God, there is no higher meaning, or for that matter, any<BR>lower meaning. This brings me to my objection to some of the<BR>earlier reviews which criticized the lack of plot in the novel.<BR>To them, I'd point out that the lack of plot is a stylistic<BR>device used to showcase the randomness and absurdity of life.<BR>The events in the novel in fact are random. Meursault does not<BR>play an active part in his fate. The shooting of the Arab was<BR>not intentional, and when he says during the trial that<BR>it was 'because of the sun', we should take him at face value.<BR>This is not a plot driven novel. Like many existentialist works,<BR>much of the prose is devoted to minor details which may seem<BR>irrelevant. Meursault once states that he has lost the habit of<BR>self-analyzation. Camus spends as little time analyzing his<BR>character as the character does himself. The style of the novel<BR>is almost phenomenological in that we are given a list of events<BR>and mindstates from the point of view of the protagonist,<BR>without analysis or futher reflection. The prose is simple and<BR>to the point. A complex plot would have worked against the<BR>theme of the book, which is man's crisis of facing the absurdity<BR>and pointlessness of existence.<br />Definately give this short novel a chance. While it does not<BR>say a lot that hasn't been said by other existentialist authors,<BR>it does so with a certain grace and economy. A word of warning<BR>though: it can be a somewhat depressing read.

It's early days and Amnesiac may well grow on me but so far I'll confine it to my albums and books file marked, 'the ones I thought I should buy'. <BR>The only 2 songs I'm hooked are Pyramid Love Song and Life In A Glasshouse. Both have drive and verve and really kick up a storm.<BR>The album is technically top dollar and there can be no criticism of their desire to stretch boundaries but for me a lot of Amnesiac is just a bit too close to lazy and self-indulgent. Kid A, its predecessor, although rated by critcs to be a similar soundscape, was a much more interesting experiment in sub- Bowie avant-garde rock. That experiment really did pin back my ears!<BR>I hope that Amnesia does not mark the decline and fall of Oxford's finest. What they do next  is going to be interesting irrespective of what it sounds like simply because of their legacy of truly innovative and exciting songs. However, I hope that former glories are revisited and allied to their worthily progressive (oh no, it's that 70's word!) rock of the 21st century.
B0000028RR|5.0|I bought this album on December 26, 1998, after just finding out that one of my favorite band at the time, Rage Against The Machine, had a debut album I never knew existed (and I have been a fan since 1996). Doing the actual calculations, I have listened to at least one of the songs on the album at least every other day to this day -- I have listened to this album over 700 TIMES.<br />Point being, this album is the embodiment of perfection. It will never lose listenability, even after 700 spins on my CD player. I can't even begin to explain the immense quality of every single instrument, plus Zack de la Rocha, the best lead singer and most powerful lyricist ever put on this earth. His lyrics are such a slap in the face to political wrong-doings and corruption with the system today that I think that some people are just afraid to listen to him. Tom Morello, simply put, is the most unique guitar player out there. He uses effects; not to make him sound better, but as part of his talent to create new unique sounds that fit each song perfectly, it's hard to believe some actually come from a guitar, sort of like a modern-day Hendrix. Timmy C.'s bass and Brad Wilk's drums are probably one of the best rhythm and bass combo in 90s rock music. Each song is a perfect 10.<br />Each song has a unique quality of its own and each song varies so much, that you could listen to this album whole and it's still like a new album you just bought each time. Tom's guitar still leaves me breathless, and Zack's lyrics are infectiously quotable and powerful, for example:<br />- Killing in the Name: &quot;... you I won't do what you tell me!&quot;<BR>- Take the Power Back: &quot;The teacher stands in front of the class, but the lesson plan he can't recall...composure is well kept, I guess he fears playing the fool, complacent students sit and listen to that bull... that he learned in school.&quot;<BR>- Know Your Enemy compromise; conformity; assimilation; submission; ignorance; hypocrisy; brutality; the elite; all of which are American dreams.&quot;<BR>-Township Rebellion: &quot;Why stand on a silent platform, fight the war, ... the norm!&quot;<br />And also, my all-time favorite from Freedom: &quot;ANGER IS A GIFT.&quot; This album will never ever let me down, and I vow to listen to it until it can't be listened to no more. Buy this album now, I have made countless people addicted to this CD, and the 3 others they put out (none of them being as good, but some songs come damn close), and now I will make you.<br />I was in such disbelief when I heard the news that Zack left the band last year that I almost cried. I really hope that he can come to his senses and come back to the band, but I will still buy his solo album and the new collaboration with Chris Cornell with the rest of the band (particularly because of Tom). <br />Rage Against The Machine 1991-2000
B000020617|2.0|Having listened to and loved the Colour and the Shape, a powerful, rocking album with great riffs and bursts of anger juxtaposed with lovely melodies and smooth vocals, I really looked forward to hearing this album. The first song, Stacked Actors boded well, containing exactly the same mix that made the Colour and the Shape one of the best albums ever, with a healthy dose of catchiness too. From there on, however, I was dissapointed. It's not a bad album, but perhaps thats the problem - the songs are mostly weak and quite boring. Learn to fly is good, as is Gimme Stiches (which has an incredible riff), but apart from that Foo Fighters seem to have run out of energy. I suppose it might work as a hook to get pop lovers into something a bit rockier, but if you like good rock I suggest you forget this and buy the Colour and the Shape instead, and hope their next album will be a bit rockier.
1879557541|4.0|May be it's just mine, but the last tape's second half didn't play at all. I was disappointed for not been able to finish the book. Overall, it was nice, and I agree with the author greatly, though I got very confused with the huge amount of info quiet often. By the way, I could hear the Reader turing pages during the last two tapes, pretty cool.
B000002N3J|5.0|this is a great album, way different from madonna's old albums, and it includes great songs like &quot;you'll see&quot; and &quot;oh father&quot; and more from all the years, and it's great to have all the madonna ballads together, old ones and new ones. you can't get enough of it. i really recommand it!!
0790729652|3.0|I was really disappointed at the movie, because Batman got beat up so much. Sure, he was smart and strong, but most of what he relied on was the Batman Suit and gadgets. He couldn't even fly; What's so cool about batman if he is so normal! It seemed to me that he was great only because he had all those money to get all those nice equipments. Though the end with the Batman Airplane hanging unto the moon was very nice, but I was amused that such a great plane was incapable of shooting accurately at a man at most 20 meters away. It just looked fake. Also, I would have liked the movie to be less SciFi, a more I-am-your-neighor kind of feeling. Really, I tried to like the movie more, but just couldn't do it.
B000002MUW|5.0|100% madonna... this is a great album, i love it!!! it's not a cd you'll stop listening to someday... the classic madonna style with great songs like &quot;secret&quot; and &quot;take a bow&quot;, it's a fun cd, it makes you wanna sing and dance with it, especially &quot;don't stop&quot;.. this cd helped me realize why madonna is the best. if you like madonna, this cd is absolutely a must, you can't love madonna and not to have &quot;bedtime stories&quot;!!! this is the best!!
0380713802|4.0|I first heard of Bill Bryson when someone mentioned him to me in a conversation. So, off I went to the bookstore, looked around, and thought, &quot;The Europe one sounds good.&quot; I have been to some of the places Bryson visits (Amsterdam, Paris, Belgium, Germany - but not the part he went to, and Istanbul) so; I wondered how we would compare notes.<br />A comment about the other reviews here; Bryson is accused of xenophobia (Fear or contempt of that which is foreign, especially of strangers or foreign peoples) and other such politically incorrect attitudes. However, I think such designations are a bit of an over reaction. I do agree with one reviewer that there seems to be some gratuitous swearing and this could have been scaled back.<br />I found it interesting when Bryson visits places that are probably not on non-European's Travel hit list; Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Yugoslavia. However, it is interesting to see what he thinks about these places. In this book, one gets a sense of what it is like to go traveling; one must constantly find places to stay and places to eat. The downside to this is that Bryson calls nearly every place he stays at very expensive; one wonders if he is comparing it to the USA... At one point, he recounts a familiar (to me anyway) travelers dilemma; one travels to experience a different culture, yet one still wants pieces of home for comfort (whether it me English-language television, recognizable food, air conditioning etc) and to acquire these comforts is often prohibitively expensive.<br />Some of my favorite parts were in Yugoslavia (he went there before all the wars, bombing etc wrecked the country), Italy and Scandinavia. A common problem that I have experienced in certain parts of Europe is communication. I have undying admiration for the Dutch; everybody in the Netherlands speaks 3 or 4 languages. I am fluent in English and to lesser degrees in French and German. Yet, I think it better to try to communicate in the local language than always blunder around in English. Sometimes strange things happen; once I was in a small town in Turkey, and in not a few shops, I met people who knew German.<br />I also agree that Bryson is fun to read and reading this reminds me of meeting people on the road and swapping stories. I have just started reading his book about Australia (title: In a sunburned country) and I think it is much better researched (there is a bibliography), the writing seems better but perhaps it is somewhat less funny (in the course sense of the word).
B00005ABKC|4.0|THis is TOm Petty and his band at their best. This album was never equalled. THe only weak point are the drums, really annoying, flat sound. The rest is close to perfection (well, if you like pop anyway...). Congratulations. This album was released in 1981.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album is a landmark rock album. First released in 1968, the album stands up as a musical masterpiece and a rock milestone. Like SGT. PEPPER and RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER, the WHITE ALBUM presents a unique and totally different musical texture and landscape. The Beatles, unlike most other musicians, were constantly evolving and experimenting musically and as artists and musicians. This is one reason why the Beatles and their music and movies stand the test of time. Current pop sensation Ricky Martin once asked why the Beatles were able to endure and remain the pinnacle of artistic achievement. The answer is found on the WHITE ALBUM. The Beatles were always willing to challenge themselves, to explore new musical frontiers, to destroy barriers and obstacles. They were always true to themselves. Above all, art is about conviction, beauty is truth, truth is beauty, and beauty and truth are how art itself is defined.<BR>In the WHITE ALBUM, the Beatles explore many themes and issues: &quot;Blackbird&quot; is about the civil rights movement, &quot;Revolution 1&quot; and &quot;9&quot; are about the assassinations and political protest movements in 1968, &quot;I'm So Tired&quot; is about the hollowness of fame and success, &quot;Yer Blues&quot; is about the isolation, loneliness, meaninglessness of being a pop/rock star. &quot;Julia&quot; is a love song, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; is a no holds barred rock and roll jam, &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot; is about finding harmony in nature, &quot;Piggies&quot; is about the establishment. Each song is a revelation and unique in its own way. The Beatles did not have to prove anything anymore. They concentrated on the music. Each of the Beatles is spotlighted on the album.<BR>One of the criticisms of this album is that the Beatles were not performing as a group but as individuals. But what is wrong with that? That is actually what gives the album its unique musical texture. Each member of the group is in the spotlight. Thismeant that the band was much more loose. The style ranges from parody to experimentation to ballads. The Beatles use the whole canvas. In the process, we see the depth of their vision and talent as musicians. They stretch out here and the result is a masterpiece. They don't hold back. As Bono of U2 said, the WHITE ALBUM is the blueprint for all rock albums that followed. The Beatles combined experimentation with songwriting fundamentals and accomplished musicianship. This is what is usually missed. Experimentation must be grounded in an anchor of musical basics and fundamentals. Otherwise, the result is unconvincing and produces noise and not beauty and art. The Beatles knew this. You can only go so far with experimentation. Being trendy and artsy just as a gimmick they knew was phony. The music had to be genuine, it had to be real. The singing and playing on the WHITE ALBUM are excellent. Eric Clapton is the guest soloist on &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. Slowhand's solos are scorchers. Who else but the Beatles would have the genius to invite Eric Clapton to play on their album? In 1969, Billy Preston would be invited to play keyboards on their sessions. Needless to say, the Beatles knew talent when they saw it. Clapton and Preston became one of the greatest musicians in the next 25 years. The Beatles approach was: If you have talent, go for it. Challenge yourself. The songs on the WHITE ALBUM are classics and standards that everyone knows. There is no point in going over the songs here. Everyone knows the songs, from the party jam &quot;Birthday&quot; to &quot;Ob-la-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot;, to the put-on parody of &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; to the psychedelic &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;.If you want to know why the Beatles were the greatest band of the 1960s,and why they remain the greatest band even today, listen to the WHITE ALBUM. The Beatles were not great because they had pop hits on the charts. Milli Vanilli and Britney Spears and N'SYNC too had many pop chart hits. The Beatles were great because they were genuine musicians and artists. They were real. What they released was art, not disposable pop rubbish. You can only go so far with hype before everyone sees through you. The Beatles understood this better than anyone else. What is so great about the WHITE ALBUM to me is that it shows the Beatles themselves struggling to transcend the hype and shallowness of the music industry. The result is a rock milestone, a classic album in rock and roll. It doesn't get any better than the WHITE ALBUM. Everything that needed to be said was said.
B00003CX7L|5.0|Sequels generally are horrible and worst than the first one. TOY STORY 2 is an example that sometimes this rule has some exceptions. What a movie, what a movie !!! The new characters are outstanding, the scene where they parody the Luke Skywalker / Darth Vader relationship is stupednous, there are few boring Disney's kind songs. Everything flows smoothly. It's for every age, but I thing adults will enjoy it more !!
0684853523|4.0|I took a lot of English classes in my high school days. Some of them actually involved writing. All of them, even if combined with the multitude of college classes I've had on the subject, have not taught me or encouraged me as much as Stephen King's &quot;On Writing.&quot; This three part book is a real treat.<br />In the first part King tells of (with great dark humor) the events in his early life that formed him as a writer. From being locked in a closet by a baby sitter, to hearing dreadful tales of a building cleanup from coworkers at a laundry mat, one can see why King writes what he does.<br />The second part of the book is a rather straightforward &quot;how to be a writer&quot; manual. King has some great insights, a raging hatred of adverbs, and entertaining illustrations of the craft to share. I find this part invaluable. Anyone who has read my reviews here on Amazon must have guessed by now how little help all my writing classes gave me. While I will no doubt not be the next Herman Melville or John Irving, I think King has given me some great stuff to work with.<br />The most moving part of the book for me is &quot;On Living.&quot; It is the tale of King's run in with a big blue van and his journey back to the land of the living. I am amazed (and glad) that he survived his injuries. The love between Stephen and Tabitha seems to be something special.<br />I give &quot;On Writing&quot; a big ol' recommendation from my heart. Thanks Steve...and keep on writing.
0140386335|5.0|This book is fantastic, no pun intended. Kids will enjoy it for just the fantasy, but adults will have the added attraction of the novel's allegorical slant. I won't tell what that is because I don't want to ruin the surprise. There's a lot to enjoy here.
0783225792|5.0|Now, I'm not the biggest fan of mob-flicks [the only other mod-movie I've seen is Suicide Kings], but I know that this is one of the best films, regardless of genre, that I've ever seen! DeNiro's performance is next to the best, and Pesci just can't be stopped! The film starts off giving the viewer a sense of amazement as to how Las Vegas functions, seen throught the eyes of a gangster. Also, it's an interesting approach having &quot;Ace&quot; and &quot;Nikki&quot; both tell the story in their own view. Anyway, Ace sets himself up as one of the greatest mobsters in LV, and it seems his indomidable presence can never be wounded. However, after firing a certain &quot;yokel&quot; who wasn't performing up to par at his job in the casino, Sam gets in trouble with the Senatory [also a yokel]. This leads to a hearing about his gaming-license, which in turn becomes his great downfall.<br />People: This movie's a classic. Probably one of DeNiro's greatest films ever. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a DVD that they'll watch as soon as it arrives, and then keep watching it ever 10 years, just to be reminded what good movies USED to be [Hell, I know I'm going to]. Also, let it be known that some of this is, in actuality, true. Of course, as with most films, a lot of it is just pure DeNiro magic.
B00005A46T|4.0|I got into Slipknot quite early on &amp; was worried that after their succes &amp; with the amount of &quot;wait &amp; bleed&quot; fans out there they would produce a more comercial album &amp; lose everything that was good about them. Well its good to hear that this hasn't happened! This album is just as brutal as the first one was and mixes many styles, there are melodic bits, thrash bits, &amp; typical slipknot mayhem. I recomend this album to anyone who like the first album &amp; although it might not be the best album to be released this year it'll definetly be in the top 3.

0060926317|1.0|I read this book in 1994, and it read like something written by a new-ager who went to the library to gather some info on Australia, and then put her beliefs on paper with an Aborigine twist on them. Although at the time I was sort of a new-ager myself, even I could smell something rotten. If you read critically, the very language she uses TELLS you that it's a hoax--it's just too new-age! If your interest is to see what Aborigines really believe and practice, and not to indulge your new-age appetite, then get something else. I'm amazed at people who say that they don't care if the story is real or not, because it so appeals to their new-age souls...this book is seriously misrepresenting the people of a REAL, as well as ancient, spiritual tradition. And those people are upset!!<br />If you want to read about how this book has been received by the real Aboriginal community, go to [...] You'll be glad you didn't buy it. Myself, I'm glad I returned mine as soon as I finished it--I couldn't stand owning it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is a ground-breaking album that has stepped up the standard on quality music.  Just like Amnesiac and Kid A it is not an easy listening album at first however after a couple of auditions the pieces of the puzzle are put into place. This makes this album brilliant because you can listen to it on many occasions unlike simple pop music that doesn't have any depth to it.  Listening to OK Computer is like walking through a long dark corridor with a bright hazy light at the end, it paints an ambient dark yet inspiring picture that is purely intriguing and will make you want to listen for more. Occasionally you will come across windows which might have beautiful green hills and blue skies, other windows will have inner city scenes articulating pain and struggle of human emotion.<br />There is an excellent balance of vocals, instrumentation and structure to each of the songs. Thom York's voice is world class and perfectly fits the music - his clear and high pitched voice pulls out your insides and twists them whilst delivering intelligent and thought provoking lyrics. This album is also a lot more acoustic which brings about a pleasant change because there is a lot more breathing space in the songs allowing for subtle background riffs to be heard. The synth and strings lift the songs and add dimension making the listener want to look further and further into the songs. <br />There are no other albums that are similar to OK Computer in my opinion and therefore it will fill a new gap in your record collection. It is not for the lighthearted purely because there is a lot more to the music than meets the eye. Listen to the lyrics and look at how the instrumentation translates it - a very intelligent album. Radiohead are one of the best at pulling out emotions that we didn't know even existed, listen to it if you don't believe me.

B000000WG4|3.0|Tubular Bells may have turned Virgin's Richard Branson into a millionaire, a good thing for CD crazed travellers however that is a far I can take the positive impact of one of the most sold albums in the world. So why is it one of the most sold albums in the world even though it is not up to scratch? First of all it has been well marketed - any album wishing to be sold in the millions needs to be well marketed though. The music is very different and original and to people sick of listening to radio music and the top ten in the charts then Tubular Bells does offer something different just like people who might want a change from Burger King  might go to KFC. Neither is better than the other but the change is nice. So if Tubular Bells is a nice change in music then why still is it only a 3 star album? There are only two songs!! Not a bad thing in some cases (Wishing You Were Here by Pink Floyd only had 5 songs and is one of the all time greatest albums) however the songs don't progress quickly enough if at all. One of the ways that Mike Oldfield progresses these two songs is to change the melodic instrument, which does change the sound, and not the melody (you might as well buy an album with only one song but different versions using different instruments). Mike Oldfield's ability of using a lot of different instruments is remarkable however with this route we are going down quantity not quality. He doesn't excel in any of these instruments so the melodies are very limited, you might as well listen to a group of top instrumentalists (Donny Hathaway - Extension Of A Man).<br />According to this review why have I given three stars and not less? It is ground breaking for its time and therefore does command a little respect, the technology in 1972 to produce an album like this must have been state of the art and I am sure that in 1972 listeners probably hadn't heard anything like it before (I wasn't around to know, I was born in 1982). With the technology of today I believe that Mike Oldfield would have done a much better job. In concluding I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone because it is repetitive, musically unsatisfying and boring. There are many artists out there today who have created better easy listening albums that Mike Oldfield so please do not waste your money on Tubular Bells - look harder!
B00005JG6Q|2.0|Akira has been my all time favorite movie for years.  I felt like a kid at Christmas when I saw it FINALLY came out on DVD.  Then the unfathomable happened.  I noticed that this classic movie's entire audio track had been redone with new dialogue and new voice actors.  All I can say is that I am heartbroken by this awful decision.  While the visuals have been greatly improved on this DVD, I will prefer the old VHS version until the original audio is brought to DVD.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The two greatest films made in the history of film, wrapped up with a mediocre Hollywood biopic. The first film: absolute perfection. Brilliance achieved with acting, directing, music, art direction... everything. The second part of the first film takes perfection to new heights. A must for anyone with family, especially an estranged family member. The third film: okay. I am sure I am not alone when I say that it does not deserve to be included in this set. It should be an option. Let us save our hard-earned money.
B00005221M|2.0|There's absolutely no action in this film! The fight sequences looked like something Walt Disney and friends could have slapped together! I sat through the whole thing, awake, which, by the way is not easy, because not only does this thing have no action, the story's not very interesting, either. The acting is overly melodramatic and the film itself is entirely to LONG.<BR>For a good movie set in the same era that's also a lot cheaper, pick up The Patriot.
6302054982|3.0|Although it's one of the most original mob films made to this date, I found it to be fairly slow.  <br />The first part is pretty interesting in how they set up the story, and how Ray Liota's character becomes involved in the mafia.  After that, though, I think it became very slow and boring.  I think I would recommend seeing this film once, but when I tried to watch it again, I lost interest after the first few scenes.
B000002NIW|5.0|This CD is one of the most unique and best metal CD's ever. The riffs on this CD are spookier than on most other nu-metal CD's. Plenty of quality tracks are on this record. Chino's voice is the spookiest voice in all of nu-metal. Another thing I like about this CD is Stephen Carpenter's excellent guitar work (it's even better on White Pony). I highly recommend this CD.<br />Favorite songs: My Own Summer, Lhabia, Around the Fur, Rickets, Be Quiet and Drive, Lotion, MX
0440219078|4.0|The book the Giver by Lois Lowry is about a community of people that live in a perfect world where everyone has what they need. They have don't have to find there own jobs or have their own kids it all done by someone else. This book is good for people of all ages and really makes you think.
B00000JZC4|1.0|This CD doesn't have many quality songs on here at all. Most of them are just the same corny crap you can hear from poppy crap rock bands like Filter. The only good poppy rock band is Everclear. There are 2 good songs on this CD. 2! I strongly don't recommend this.<br />Favorite songs: Welcome to the Fold, Captain Bilge
B000002KE2|5.0|I was 14 yrs old when Vol.4 hit the airwaves. Being a Sabbath fan already, [Paranoid hooked me] Vol.4 was simply &quot;icing on the cake&quot;! Few bands can follow up with equal, or superior work, to match their &quot;as good as it gets&quot; previous album. But, not only did they do it with Vol.4, they did as well with, Master Of Reality.In many of their songs, Black Sabbath reflected the devastating influences of WWII, and realities of post WWII England, which is witnessed in their arousing, thought provoking lyrics.What else can be said... Black Sabbath was the creator of &quot;Heavy&quot; Metal!
B00000IPAX|5.0|These days, people think that Blink 182 are just another sell-out pop band. Nowadays, if you walk in to public places with Blink 182 shirts, people think you are a pop fan. Those people have probably only heard &quot;All The Small Things&quot;. This CD might not be as punk as their prior CD's, but that doesnt make them sell out. In fact, this CD is awesome. It's definitely one of their catchier releases. Some songs are punkier than others, and I think people who dont like Blink 182 should listen to those. This CD has the cleanest production, which is a little sad, but hey, they got cash now. I recommend this CD to anyone.<br />Favorite songs: Dumpweed, Don't Leave Me, Aliens Exist, Going Away To College, What's My Age Again, Adam's Song, Party Song, Wendy Clear, Anthem
B000058T5E|5.0|Jeff Beck has always been my favorite guitarist since the sixties and this album is a killer. As good as or better than Blow by Blow or Wired. The first cut Earthquake is downright menacing and Dirty Mind conveys that dark, sexually charged undertoe that surfaces in most of his playing. His phrasing,vibrato and Stratified screams leave you in a cold sweat. His cover of Rollin' and Tumblin' is awesome.He doesn't play the guitar,he strangles it! The more you listen,the more you will love You Had It Coming. You young guitar punks got nothing on Jeff Beck!
B00004Y635|1.0|this movie should not have been written. This movie is the absolute worst of the scream series. \\"Terror on the movie set\\"<BR>is sort of the theme for the movie.  Being that this movie was the final installment you would think that it would be good but NO. The ending is the worst.  The only good thing about this movie is the cameos. (especially the one by Jay & Silent bob)
B00004U2G4|5.0|Jeff Beck was/is the forgotten hero, which is sad considering he may be the greatest of all. Jeff Beck took the Yardbirds to heights Clapton only dreamed about and then he flew the coop. Luckily for us he came back stronger. His debut solo/group album shows his real power as a guitar virtuoso. The reworking of his Yarbird-days hit &quot;Shapes of Things&quot; blows away the solid original in every way. It keeps going from there. Other standout tracks inlcude &quot;Beck's Bolero&quot; and &quot;I Ain't Superstitious.&quot; If you like guitars then it doesn't get much better than this.
B000002KO1|5.0|This is an absolute stunner of a debut album with an incredible band that meshes together in an amazing chemistry rarely found in rock.  Bassist Pete Farndon, unsung drum hero Martin Chambers, and especially guitar wizard James Honeyman Scott provide the perfect vehicle for Chrissie Hynde to get her point across.  (I find it just amazing that what with all the great bands coming out of England in the late 70's that these guys were not already in another band.)<BR>     The album starts with the barely under control thrash of Precious, truly a legendary song.  Chrissie wonders if she is pregnant, says a couple of naughty words, and in the end decides so what lets rock. Musician magazine once speculated that this is the greatest use of the f-word in rock history.  Hard to believe now, but this attitude from the women's point of view was considered so shocking at the time--1980.  (I just remember that I was nearly kicked off my college radio station for playing this song in 1982)<BR>     The rest of the first side has some more great thrash punk songs in The Wait and Up the Neck, but the centerpiece of the first half is definitely Tattooed Love Boys.  Check out James Honeyman-Scott's short but inventive solo and especially Martin Chamber's drum part--this track has got to have the greatest drumming of any punk/new wave song ever recorded. (as a previous reviewer noted, it is not 4/4 time but some weird 7/5 time that is virtually impossible to play)  <BR>     The 2nd half features the tender side of Chrissie's songwriting with Kid (the sequel to Precious?) and the hit Brass In Pocket.  The beauty of the 2nd side is in sharp contrast to the 1rst side.  <br />     This version of the band would only last for one more album before ending tragically so I strongly suggest if you are any kind of a fan of post punk to give this record a listen.  The importance of Chrissie Hynde cannot be understated--she virtually alone proved that chicks can rock (intelligently and it is OK for a guy to listen)
6303022901|2.0|The film opens with a fake story about a duck that wants to be a swan, and says, you see this, this is what it means to have Chineseness. Uh, all we Chinese do to ducks or swans is eat them. Then, there's the idea that a &quot;woman's worth is measured by the loudness of her husband's belch.&quot; You won't find anything in Chinese culture or literature about Chinese males measuring the worth of women by how well they feed them. If you want the facts on Chinese people, you won't find it in this movie.  I recommend you guys see SEVEN SAMURAI by the great Akira Kurosawa who knew the Chinese Heroic Tradition well.
B000002J1L|4.0|Genesis' debut album had been a somewhat overambitious (for teenagers) retelling of the Biblical history of mankind, all in twelve short folk-pop tunes; the second album, &quot;Trespass&quot;, was a heartfelt album of more complex compositions that began to define their sound, but stayed within somewhat normal prog-rock confines.  &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; was a key Genesis album in many ways, for it not only introduces the greater instrumental firepower of guitarist Hackett and drummer Collins into the group, but marks the ascendance of Gabriel's bizarre lyrical vision--the weirdness truly begins here, and should prick the ears of anyone who thinks &quot;In Too Deep&quot; is the highlight of the group's career.<br />At this point in rock history Genesis were merely trying to keep up with the times: heavy rock bands like Zeppelin, ELP, King Crimson, Yes, even Black Sabbath (those were the days!).  Thus, &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; ends up as an interesting amalgam of quiet English folk, proto-metal and symphonic mellotron grandeur, with a few pop songs added in for good measure.  The overall sound builds on that of &quot;Trespass&quot; but the arrival of Collins and Hackett--both of who arrived with very distinct styles--gives the tracks more muscle and originality.  Of particular note is Hackett's guitar technique, which employed two-handed tapping years before Van Halen and a brittle, staccato typewriter-ish sound to accompany the attack of the killer plants in &quot;Hogweed&quot;. Many fans compain about the overall production, although the CD remaster is arguably better than the vinyl and about as good as the album is ever likely to sound.<br />What really set the group apart from the majority of its contemporaries, however, was the increasingly surreal stance of the twenty-one year old Peter Gabriel, who abandoned any pretense of earnest, straightforward lryic writing on this album for a more twisted, ironic, cynical and spiritual edge that was definitely a leapforward in originality and sophistication for both the group and the generally po-faced ethic of prog-rock in general.  The mix of high drama and subversive humor finds its mark in cautionary tales of giant killer plants (based on an actual news story), humble restaurant owners driven to the brink of suicidal insanity, and a certain ten-year old boy named Henry who comes back as an old man to haunt his murderous fellow croquet player Cynthia.  Such topics, which stirred elements of sexual lust, the doorways between life and death and the darker undercurrent of the English subconscious were completely alien to rock music at the time and when later acted out by Gabriel in various masks and costumes on stage, would cause a minor sensation that continues to draw a rabid cult following to this day (indeed, one popular Canadian cover band names itself after &quot;The Musical Box&quot;).  For all of its innovations, however, the album is not perfect; when other members of the group step up to the lyrical plate--as on &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; and &quot;Fountain Of Salmacis&quot;--the fun is once again replaced by unintentionally campy retellings of fairy tales and ordinary UK life.  Still, the music throughout &quot;Salmacis&quot; is the most complex the band could muster up to that point.  Genesis would refine and perfect the sound and vision of &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; on its next four albums, fine-tuning their musical attack, production values and lyrical creativity (which became less self-consciously &quot;clever&quot; and more dream-like with each release), but this is where it all began.

0201485672|5.0|I would have to give 2 thumbs up to Martin Fowler's book on Refactoring. He has addressed so many common refactorings in such a simple and elegant way that many will benefit from his work (as well as the others that helped write this book).<br />Martin's writing style is very relaxed and sincere. He's entertaining and doesn't complicate things as you can easily find what you need. You can tell he simply wants to make programming teams' lives easier and he has accomplished tenfold. He's not going to tell you that your an innately bad programmer or that he is a better one - he truely captivates that quality code is important and refactoring is that one big step that each organization and programmer must take to improve the quality of code.<br />Some of the patterns that he identifies are very common - but for completeness' sake, he includes them. Others are very insightful such as Introducing Null objects, which I've used 5 times in a single application now since I've read this book.<br />This is also an excellent book to accompany Design Patterns, as many of these refactorings will help you achieve design patterns in your code - it's like working them in your code in a different, systematic way.<br />All in all, this is a fantastic contribution to improving code and developing quality programmers in the software development industry.  I would recommend this to any software professional and especially university students (where quality code is not touched on at all).  It's the will of the programmer to improve their code and this is one of those books to read if you want to do that.  If you want to just be an average programmer, a following in your organization and not take responsibility - then don't read this book.  If you want to truely be effective in your job or entrapreneural projects, add this book to your bookshelf and read it, use it and live it.
7119005901|5.0|I am sure that I couldn't extol this epic's virtures moreso than the other reviewers have already. I would just like to point out that the unabridged version is the only way to go - some of the other reviewers who claim certain parts are left out/translation errors are referring to the abridged version. For example, Zhuge Liang's taming of the Man in the South is represented in full in the unabridged version, and all the ideas are present and translated. Get this version if you can afford it - if you can't, save up until you can. It's as simple as that, really.
B00003CXAE|4.0|Grase is a pure classic I remember going to see it the day after it opened and it was packed I waited for 3 hours for tickets but it was worth it ANYWAYS <BR>  Grease is about a High School boy who meets this girl (Sandy) on the beach during the summer but when they supriseingly run into each other at school, the movie really has a little to much singing after watching it a few times you will relize that the movie is mostly just singing and the plot of the movie just kinda drifts with all of the singing.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I've reviewed this album before, but I decided to review it again... I love this album... I'm listening to it now, and it's awesome... Radiohead was really one of the first bands I got into(U2 was the first really, but anyways), and The Bends was maybe the second or third cd I bought... I now have over a hundred albums from Aphex Twin, to Led Zepplin, to Miles Davis, to Peter Gabriel... when I bought Ok Computer, I was into pretty poppy music... not saying anything against U2, cause they're a damn good band, but their music is radio friendly... but Ok Computer really opened my eyes to what good music can really be... I enjoyed this album on so many levels... yes there are single quality songs on here, but that's what's so amazing about this album... it's radio friendly, but can withstand numerous listens (I've owned this for years, and it still sounds fresh)... And really, this is similar to the Beatles music... it was poppy, with catchy hooks and all, but was very innovative... Radiohead was the band that got me interested in Techno music, and on this album they dabble very effectively... there are electronic sounds all throughout the recording, and none of them sound out of place... As with the concept album idea, I think it's definately about technology taking over... I mean, just listen to some of the songs, the end of Karma Police, and the music makes this idea clear... when Thom Yorke sings &quot;For a minute there, I lost myself&quot; you can hear his voice sounds like its fading away and being taken over by the electronically produced sounds... that's my favorite part of the album by the way...<br />anyways, I've gone on long enough... this album is one of the best all time no doubt, but THE best? I don't know... It is in my opinion the best of the 90's, and that alone is enough for it to be considered the best all time, but when you're talking about the all time best album, there's more to take into account then just the music... influence, is it groundbreaking, etc... and well, The Beatles are THE band there... I don't like The Beatles, but one of their albums, I guess Sgt. Pepper would probably be the best all time... Ok Computer however, is one of my FAVORITES...
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple has THE sexiest voice I have ever heard. Her brilliance doesn't stop here, however. Her songwriting skills are unsurpassed in the female vocalist category. She is an exceptional pianist and her understanding of musical simplicity is remarkable. This is one of my favorite albums.
B0000028VT|5.0|The second and third album are the hardest for any artist.Mariah keeps turing out fantastic ballads and dance numbers in &quot;MusicBox.&quot;My favorite hit is &quot;DreamLover.&quot; Mariah's vocals are all over this song.High,low,she takes you everywhere you want to.Carey used this style on alot of her hits after this number 1 record.&quot;Hero&quot;and &quot;Without you&quot; are wonderfull ballads, but Music Box,&quot; is my favorite .There's not much production on this cut,just Mariah's vocals and keyboards.The dance numbers are great,but I love the ballads the most ,&quot; except for &quot;Dreamlover,&quot;my all time favorite song from this gifted artist.
B00003CXSP|1.0|&quot;Hannibal&quot; as several characteristics that set it apart from &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; The plot is weak and fairly predictable. Scene transitions are poorly developed. It is gross simply for the sake of being gross. Anthony Hopkins was true to the &quot;Hannibal&quot; form but, Julianne Moore as Agent Starling was no Jodie Foster. She looked the part but no other personality traits carried over. Casting would have been improved had Ms Moore played a different agent. Finally, the movie was fairly well photographed and the DTS 5.1 sound was OK. But, overall, the film alternates between being sick and sicker. No wonder it was a box office flop.
0385486804|5.0|I discovered \\"Into the Wild\\" while writing \\"Discovering Denali\\", a reference book to Denali National Park in Alaska. I once took six months from life and toured the country by motorcycle and could relate very well to Chris McCandless. But, if you ever wondered what it's really like to live in the wild, read this book. He led an amazing life while wandering from place to place. To hear from those who were touched by Chris' extraordinary qualities was also very moving. The story had a sad ending, but few people have experience life like Chris did.
B00005B5L4|4.0|This is my first DVD-Audio Disc. I would have given it 5 stars if I had a DVD Audio player with 6.1,since it would probably sound superb. On my present system, the sound was ok but it had this muffled quality to it. It wasn't quite as clear and crisp as I expected it to be. I think it's still good anyway, and the interviews were great.
B00005A46T|5.0|I wasn't sure about this album before it came out. I didn't know how Slipknot could come up with more songs that could compare to their first album. BUT THEY DID! I am so amazed by this album.... But is it better? Yes and No. Some songs are and some aren't. Theres a few songs with some catchy melodic stuff in there and some just pure .... Overall I don't think this CD is better than their first, but it is definately up to par. I definately recommend it to previous Slipknot fans, you won't be dissapointed. Great job by Slipknot on this and I'm going to see you live SEPTEMBER 26!....
B000000WHC|1.0|My Uncle recently loaned this CD to me. All I can say is it is obvious Gary Moore ate too many lead paint chips as a child and has no concept of real blues music.  The reason for this harsh review is that my uncle was a member of a harshly reviewed band by Gary Moore himself and my uncle before the review considered Mr. Moore a wonderful and talented artist.  BUT, after reading his review of Frost music, one of Detroit's premier  groups of the late sixties and seventies, I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Moore has obviously lost more brain cells than we had originally anticipated.  Either that or his near fatal accident affected his ability to review music competently!!!  Thankyou
1878424432|1.0|The title grabs one's attention since it promises to address all of life's challenges and problems with a neat &quot;four agreements.&quot; As might be expected it proves to be over-simplistic. What I did not expect is that it is contradictory at several points as it tries to wed several ancient, well worn philosophies, all of which have been tried and rejected as serious contenders for a wholistic worldview. Ruiz dichotomizes and fragments the human being, suggesting that we and our minds are not part of a whole personality. He contridicts himself, first telling us to reject those things our minds suggest but then telling us we should passively accept whatever comes to mind. He totally overlooks the question of authority, apparently expecting us to think he has some inner light not available to the rest of humanity. His &quot;agreement&quot; that we should not take anything personally is nothing more than a rehash of stoicism which has been rejected as emotionally stunted by all world religions. If put into practice by Ghandi or Martin Luther King it would have singlehandedly killed the 20th century civil rights movement. Ruiz fills in with a melange of platitudes such as &quot;Do Your Best&quot; where substance is lacking. This is a vague new age quest for non-specific spirituality at its best, or theology and philosophy at its worst!
6305499365|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I did not find it that funny because I did not know how a day in an office job went.  However, after I worked in such an environment, I rerented this movie and I laughed till my stomach hurt.  Peter, Michael Bolton and the guy with the name nobody can say played corporate slaves to a T.  My favorite part of the movie is when they are in Peter's apartment dancing like fools.  Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who has worked in an office for any amount of time, you will see yourself in this movie!!
B00004WC6J|5.0|After reading all the reviews on this CD I found out that most of the \\"critics\\" have one thing in common, which is embracing a certain image of Sylvian's music. In this respect \\"Everything and Nothing\\" might not have fulfilled everybody's expectations, but at the same time it shows the diversity of Sylvian's music. Listening to the tracks made me nod and at times shake my head in \\"disagree\\" to the new interpretation, but that is the real fun of this CD. If you are a fan of Sylvian's this is a must. \\"Ghosts\\" definitely lacks the depth of its original version. One of my all time favorites, \\"Bamboo Music\\", gets a bit too \\"slick\\" with Sakamoto's voice beeing pushed into the foreground much more than in the original. But still all the tracks are fun listening to. And, yes, \\"Ride\\" would definitely have earned this CD a sixths star!
B000001EC1|5.0|This is THE essential album for the Bon Jovi fan, and for anyone who loves great 80's rock.  This collection is vintage Jon Bon &amp; Co., 11 greatest hits &amp; 3 new cuts for '94. All the hits are here, spanning the first ten years from '84 to '94. The hits include: &quot;Wanted Dead Or Alive&quot; (which is my all time fav Bon Jovi song and it features a killer acousic intro by Richie Sambora and brilliant lyrics by Jon).  &quot;Livin' On A Prayer&quot;, &quot;You Give Love A Bad Name&quot;, &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; (which features great keyboard playing by David Bryan), &quot;I'll Be There For You&quot;, &quot;Lay Your Hands On Me&quot;, &quot;Bed Of Roses&quot;(which features great piano intro by Jon and fantastic guitar solo by Sambora).  Also the very early hits &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;In And Out Of Love&quot; are here.  3 new cuts are the unforgettable hit &quot;Always&quot;(which is a great romantic song), &quot;Someday I'll Be Saturday Night&quot;, and a newly recorded and laid-back version of &quot;Livin On A Prayer&quot; entitled &quot;Prayer '94&quot;.  If you love great music, don't let this one slip by.  Brings back some great memories for me, and is a great listen any time.  If you don't have it, get it.  ROCK ON!
B000059XUI|3.0|Unlike the DVD release for the first film, Superman II has not been digitally cleaned-up.  The quality of the recording is no better than that of video tape.  Add the fact that the extra scenes which were restored when released on television over the years are completely absent and a complete lack of extras and you end up with a sub-par package. More than a little disappointing.
0812550757|5.0|As basically any other Brazilian science fiction reader, I was always curious about Orson Scott Card's  &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, famous in my country as one of the few American scifi books making any reference to the Brazilian culture. My review will focus on this particularity of this book - I think that I have a privileged viewpoint to write about that, and I think that other readers have already commented well enough more universal aspects of the book, like psychological diving and cultural conflicts.<br />Well, overall, I would say that O.S. Card was convincing while creating an extraplanetary colony with Brazilian flavor. In many parts of the book, I felt myself immersed in a small Brazilian countryside town - not exactly my expertise, for I've always lived in major Brazilian cities. And so, in many ways, cultural aspects of the Lusitania colony, like for instance the massive influence of Catholicism, are completely alien for me. Anyhow, O.S. Card visited Brazil twenty years ago, when things were very, very different.<br />However, Card often slips when using the Portuguese language. Although he may speak Portuguese fluently, and although he even has a perception of the language deep enough to make sophisticated word games in some points, he sometimes make the mistake of trusting too much in literal translations, resulting in inevitably weird expressions. (Nothing wrong with that. Probably, this text is littered with language oddities written by someone whose first language is Portuguese.) The most prominent of all is the very title of the book: he translates &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; as &quot;Falante pelos Mortos&quot;, a literal translation that makes little sense to Brazilians. Here, the book was actually published as &quot;O Orador dos Mortos&quot; (and &quot;O Porta-Voz dos Mortos&quot; would also be an acceptable translation).<br />Also, the importance of the Portuguese language and culture to the Brazilian culture is kind of overestimatedalong the book. Brazil is a country formed by racial and cultural mix, and five hundred years of mixing left a population with little ethnical and cultural resemblance to its original components. So, naming Lusitania a planet colonized by Brazilians makes less sense than naming Britannia a planet colonized by New Yorkers...<br />Finally, I must emphasize that that's just a critique to the Brazilian culture portrayed in the book. But \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is much bigger than that, and if this aspect has some weakness, the rest of the books is yet another AWESOME story by O.S. Card...
B000053V7Q|1.0|The original version of &quot;Elvis: That's The Way It Is&quot; was a classic about a musical legend. Yes there were some annoying fan interviews which did slow down the overall impact of the movie, but this new &quot;Special Edition&quot; version of the movie is just a 21st century, MTV-style edited version that, while it still entertains, leaves those of us who saw the original version of the movie, wanting much much more. I don't want to see fast motion montages of Vegas, or Elvis and his entourage walking backstage, this is supposed to be a chronicle of one of the greatest performances of the King of Rock and Roll, not the Benny Hill Show! Alright, so all those interviews were wiped out, good move. But for all the good that did, cutting out several of the King's best songs (shown in the original version) just wasn't worth it. I don't know who decided to produce this new &quot;Special Edition&quot; version, but it's obvious they went about it all wrong. What about the DVD extras? A 9 minute pretty worthless documentary about the reconstruction of the movie. Also some more useless tidbits about who Elvis was...blah blah blah...as if the actual person who would buy this DVD would have never heard of him or his life story by now. It really saddens me to say this, but I wanted to love this DVD. I wanted to look at this movie, and say &quot;This is the difinitive Elvis DVD EVERYONE should own&quot;, unfortunately, I have to say to people...if you can find it anywhere, buy the original version instead. Oh the potential is there for a newer, far better version of this movie to be released, but it's too bad this version doesn't cut it. Now I'll tell you what REAL Elvis fans would like to see in the DVD &quot;Elvis: That's The Way It Is (The FANS' version). Take the original version of the movie, then remove all the fan interviews. Now take all the pre-show planning scenes of the original, combine them with the pre-show scenes of the new version, and edit them together into one great &quot;Behind the Scenes of Elvis: That's The Way It Is&quot;...This will be the 90 minute &quot;making of the show&quot; (DVD Extra)...Now that we know what the DVD extra will be, what about the title movie? Well, with all the great new concert footage used in this special edition, they should combine all of it, with the old footage, as well as all the songs from the original version that were FOOLISHLY edited out for the Special Edition. There you have it. THIS is what Elvis fans want: 1. A 90 minute &quot;Making of&quot; documentary that shows all the behind the scenes action, clowning around, etc. and 2. A 90 minute &quot;In Concert&quot; version of &quot;Elvis: That's The Way It Is&quot;, which shows all the actual performance footage from the original version, plus the new found footage from the Special Edition. Yes the DVD quality of this version looks awesome, but I wanted a coherent concert movie, not the mess they gave us. Nuff said.
B00004XOWM|4.0|I got this CD in the wake of hearing &quot;Rollin&quot; on TRL.  I feel that while Limp has sold out on some of their songs (such as &quot;Get Your Groove On.&quot; This is just ridiculous.  Save that for X, not a Limp Bizkit alblum), mostly all of them are great.  I especially like &quot;Hold On&quot; and &quot;The One&quot; because they keep it up with honest lyrics.  Those are probably my two favorite songs. It is no surprise that &quot;My Way&quot; is nominated for a couple of MTV awards, it is one of the better songs on there, mostly because it appeals to all Limp Fans, old or new.  Unfortunately, there is just a little too much rap on the CD.  Fred has strayed from his early days of &quot;no-vocal metal&quot; to his &quot;rapping to rock&quot; style.  Although true Limp fans will argue that Fred has sold out, and they are right, I think Fred would rather do that because he has made tons more money off of Chocolate Starfish than he has off of Significant Other or 3 Dollar Bill Y'all.  I would much rather make a lot of money, now wouldn't you? True pundits can say he has sold out, and I'm not arguing with them, only to say that I would rather change my style a little bit if it made my next alblum jump in sales by a million copies or so.  In fact, I think that Fred does not notice or does not care when his fans say he's sold out, because when he has concerts on the Family Values tour and he plays his &quot;true&quot; songs, those are the ones that will thrill fans.  So what if 14 year olds like his music?  It's just like comparing a fan who has only heard Sugar Ray songs that have been released.  Sugar Ray plays happy songs that get play on the local pop stations, but if you've ever been to a Sugar Ray concert, they rock pretty hard on some of their songs.  So is the way with Fred Durst and Limp Bizkit.  If you haven't heard anything from his 2 earlier alblums and think Limp is all about rapping to rock, then you are sorely mistaken and you will wonder &quot;whythe heck there is so much metal, isn't Limp Bizkit about rap?&quot;  Such is the way with the true Limp fan.  They'll be there in the end, and although they will not like every song on Chocolate Starfish, you can't please everyone every time.  Just wanted to say to the wondering person out there, if you are having second thoughts, give this CD a try.  You may find that you won't like every song, but you'll enjoy the majority of them.  Especially those that don't make it to the airways.
0201626632|5.0|I got this book when I was trying to decide what to do after graduate school (I'm still in, but soon I'll be finished). This book and my experiences in graduate school really opened my eyes as to what a university professor really does and is expected to do. This book give a realistic account of what happens to assistant professors. This is one of the main factors that lead me away from that line of work. There are many little bits of information (that probabally have been learned the hard way) in this book that can really simplify your life if your looking for a science career. It isn't long and it doesn't matter how busy you think you are, if your going into the sciences your absolutely have to read this book. Some of what is in here, you'll already know, but trust me it is worth the short amount of time if takes to read it.
B000056K04|1.0|Easily the worst release the band has offered, Everyday is full of trite lyrics and numerous references to rain -  no doubt a result of Glen Ballards \\"input\\".  The change of style of music and lyrical tone isn't so much a shock as the uninspired lyrics are.  This album lacks the depth of previous releases from the band.  RCA had a hand in this one as well.  The label didn't like the \\"dark\\" tones of the previous sessions recorded with long time producer Steve Lillywhite, so the superior tracks were shelved - only to resurface on the internet.  A lot has been made of whether or not people had the right to hear and in many cases distribute these unreleased recordings, but in my opinion, if you were duped into paying ... for Everyday, you deserved something better for your money, mainly the Lillywhite Sessions for free.  <BR>Glen Ballard managed in one record to turn a successful and popular band with its own sound into a cookie cutter sounding pop band like most of us are all sick of today.  This was most likely the bands last studio release with RCA, although a new live cd will be released soon - a last gasp for the label to grab more cash from the DMB name.  Let's hope that if the band moves to their own label, they don't put out another dissapointing flop like Everyday.
B000002KBH|1.0|like man I put this disc on for my siameses cat Reggie and I swear to god he tried to gnaw through the radio plug, luckily I unplugged it. So I was all like &quot; What gives lil Reggie you don't feel the Dead?&quot; and he was all like licking his tail then he took a nap.
B00004Z459|5.0|The band Linkin Park defiantely isn't your ordinary band! The CD is just explosive, the CD starts with the song &quot;Papercut&quot; which is one of the best songs on the album. Mike (one of the TWO lead singers) raps while Chester (the other) does the chourus and some other parts. This has been released as a singer in the UK and I'm thinking it'll be released in the US as their 4th single soon. Next is the ever popular &quot;One Step Closer.&quot; It's a great song which of course was their first single, great lyrics and catchy guatar rifts. Further down the cd is &quot;Crawling&quot; (2nd Single) which really made a name for them. Personally is my favorite song. Track 8 is the ever popular &quot;In the End&quot; which will be there 3rd single, the video is being released within the next week. It has everything, piano, rapping. Chester gets to show off some of those singing abilities off in this one. The CD doesn't stop there of course, other great ones include &quot;Place for My Head,&quot; &quot;With You,&quot; and &quot;Runaway.&quot; Just an explosive CD, a must buy!
B00003CXSP|4.0|I first read the book - excellent.  I was anxious to see the movie!  It followed the book pretty well, but the ending is so totally different!  Why change the endings like that?  I much preferred the ending in the book.  Other than that, it was overall a good movie.  Don't plan on eating while you watch it!  If you don't have a weak stomach, I'd recommend this movie.
0679879269|5.0|then Phillip Pullman's The Amber Spyglass. It was not that I felt like I had some sort of relation to the characters, for I have almost nothing in common with Lyra or Will, the two main characters. It was Pullman's writing, pulling me deeper and deeper into the story, making me want to be there; feeling the sorrow, joy, love, and the many other wonderful feelings and emotions that have been packed into this amazing book.<br />The Amber Spyglass is the sequel to The Golden Compass (my favorite book of last year) and The Subtle Knife, the other two books in Pullman's His Dark Materials series. The Amber Spyglass cannot be read or understood without reading the first two books. In the first book, The Golden Compass, Lyra Belaqua (later renamed Lyra Silvertongue) discovers that she is more than what she seems, for she can read the mysterious alethiometer, or truth meter. She turns knobs and hands to ask a question, and it replies to her by pointing to a number of various symbols that compile into an answer. In the second book, The Subtle Knife, she meets up with Will in a world called Citagazze, and he comes into the possession of the Subtle Knife, which is a blade so powerful on one side that it will cut through anything with one easy swipe- rock, stone, anything. The other side is so subtle that it cuts through the film between worlds: ours, Lyra's, and the thousands of other worlds parallel to each other.<br />In The Amber Spyglass, Lyra and Will travel to the world of the dead so that Lyra can speak to her friend Roger, whose death she blames on herself. To go there, a part of themselves was torn out of their hearts. For Lyra, it was her daemon that she left on shore, who shares her thoughts, her desires and her personality. As for Will, he comes from our world, so his daemon is inside, but his trip to the land of the dead formed his daemon to a real animal, like Lyra's. When they got to the silent, endless plain where the terrified ghosts were huddled, Lyra realized that her destiny is to free all of these souls into a world, where they will float, as atoms, and be part of a real world again. Will opens a window into a world where Dr. Mary Malone, a scientist from our world has been living with a race called the mulefa, who look somewhat like antelope, but instead of a central spine, they have a diamond shaped structure. What is most odd about the mulefa is that they travel by using wheels. A strange pod grows on a species of tree that is vital to this world, and it is this that the mulefa use as their wheels. The trees are dying, and they must be saved. The entrance of the ghosts' atoms into this world balanced it out.<br />The Amber Spyglass is definitely the best book I've ever read. This series is said to rival Harry Potter and I wholeheartedly agree. The Harry Potter books just don't have the same mysterious air to them, or the seriousness and depth of the plots of these books. There are so many stories involved within this book; Lyra and Will's, Mary Malone and the mulefa (before Will and Lyra met up with them), Lyra's parents, and quite a few others that I won't go into. I would have been quite pleased even if the only story here was that of Mary and the mulefa, or likewise Lyra and Will's story. But Pullman's way of blending them all into one perfectly mixed concoction of wonder and amazement makes reading this book a pure joy. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, all ages, everywhere, for it truly is a marvelous masterpiece.
0800196767|5.0|I'm really picky about movies, my only favorites are:<BR>The Wizard of Oz<BR>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory<BR>Legally Blonde<BR>Princess Diaries<BR>DR.2<BR>All That Glitters<BR>and now Matilda<BR>well, maybe I'm not that picky!<br />I found Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at the school  library. I read it, loved. Then I decided i liked that author so i picked up a copy of Matilda (my favorite book). Read it, loved it. So i decided to get the movie Matilda. I got, watched it, loved it. I know added it to my very picky Picky (hehehehehe) list of fav movies! READ THE BOOK. YOU'LL LOL. WATH THE MOVIE. YOU'LL LOL.!<br />age group: 4 to 104
0380018179|4.0|The summarize the Thorn Birds, it is a great, but very depressing book.  The first part of the book is especially depressing, so if you're looking for a feel-good kind of book I definitely don't recommend it.  There is nothing humourous in this book.  It is the tragic love story between Meggie Cleary and Ralph DeBriccarcent  (I don't think I spelled his name right!).  They both love each other, but Ralph is far too self-absorbed and ambitious to show some humility and admit his love to Meggie.  and Meggie is too obsessive to get over Ralph and move on with her life.  That's the really sad part.  Most of us have had some bad experience with love sometime in our lives, or even had our heart's broken.  But most people are able to pick up and move on after awhile.  Well Meggie spends literally her WHOLE life pining away for Ralph, whom she knows she can never have.  That's the tragedy.  Her whole life is ruined because of her obsession.  It is said that Meggie is a strong character but I think if she was really strong she should have actually done something worthwhile with her life and found a man who really loved her, enough to give her a warm home and many children as she always wanted (unlike Luke!).  The only purpose her whole life had was the raising of her two children.  Of course one of them had to die to make the book even more tragic but let's just say that the children are the two strongest characters in the book.  Dane, her son, becomes a preist like Ralph, but unlike Ralph, he is the perfect preist.  Instead of simply trying to move up in position in the church, he is sincerely interested in finding God and the way to best serve him.  Justine is also an amazing character and in all the other reveiws I've read, she's been absolutely neglected.  Justine's being in the book is the very reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 2.  When the book focuses on Justine the book really livens up.  Here's a woman who won't spend her life pining away for a man who doesn't love her.  This girl is moving!!!!!!!!  She isn't content to waste her life as a nothing on little old Drogheda.  She runs out into the real world and grasps from it what she can.  And she becomes a rich and famous actress in London because of it!  Plus, she is EXTREMELY intelligent and quick-minded.  Her vocation choice (an actress) fits her perfectly and she is brillant as an actress as she is in everything else.  Well, everything except love and emotion, but she does have an emotional awakening at the end.  She is a lot of fun, has many friends and is very exuberant.  Unlike the other characters who seem to refuse to be happy no matter what there circumstances Justine excepts happiness.  She is by far the happiest character in the book (Dane and Rain are close at least).  Unlike her mother, grandmother and Ralph who are content to stay down in the dumps and depressed for their whole lives, Justine always stays mostly high-spirited and optimistic.  That's one of the reasons you've gotta love her, she brings some cheer and humour and vivacity into this tragic-beyond-real-life book.  She's a very spirited and animated and lively, energetic person who is vivid and will stay in your mind.  So don't forget Justine.  She helps the book out a lot in the end and really ties things together well.  You cannot wait to find out what this chic does next!  I think they should have a sequel called JUSTINE.  Well anyway, this is definitely a book you want to read, and if the middle has you down a little bit, the Justine part will perk you up a bit.
B00004XOWM|1.0|This CD has some great, rockin tunes, but Fred Durst just can't write a song.  Almost every song on this CD either has the F word or L-I-M-P B-I-Z-K-I-T in it.  Its total crap, if you like rock, get something with meaning like Finger Eleven. I can't say the band doesn't have talent though, since West Borland's solo project, Big Dumb Face, is great.   Fred Durst screws up Limp Bizkit, this CD isn't nearly worth shelling out 15 bucks.
6301969251|4.0|&quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the best, if not the best, Jesus films to come out of Hollywood. It may not be 100% accurate, but it certainly follows the Gospel story more closely than other films, such as &quot;King of Kings&quot;.Max Von Sydow is very good as a quietly dignified Jesus of Nazareth, and Charlton Heston gives a great performance as John The Baptist. Indeed, Heston almost steals the show in the first half of the film. Telly Savalas is also very good,as a calculating and sinister Pontius Pilate.This film is often singled out for criticism by viewers and critics alike, due to all the cameos in the picture. And it does seem that every actor in Hollywood of this period appears in one role or another. But don`t let this ruin your enjoyment of the movie.The cameo thing was a common Hollywood ploy in epic, high budget films of the `60s. &quot;How the West Was Won,&quot;The Longest Day,&quot;and certain other films of the time used the same gimmic, to draw in theater goers.Taken as a whole,'The Greastest Story Ever Told&quot; is a very moving film on the life of Christ, with above average acting and a beautiful music score.Definately worth a look.
6304578482|5.0|This movie is one to add to your collection! It is hilarious.
B000002U82|5.0|Every few years or so, an album comes along that defines an era or feeling.  Dark Side of the Moon wasn't the first to do this, but may be the best album of all time at striking a feeling in the listener.  Not only is every song great, but they all fit together perfectly. From the opening heart beat on &quot;Speak to Me&quot; to the closing of &quot;Brain Damage/Eclipse&quot;, Roger Waters and Co. show why Dark Side was the the longest running album on the top 200 of all time.  Songs like &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Us and Them&quot; have become radio favorites over the years.  But others like &quot;Great Gig in the Sky&quot;  are no less deserving.  In short, a must have for any rock fan.
B00003CXBK|5.0|For those not familiar with animie, the first 10 minutes may seem a bit extreme in the violence area, beheadings and all.  However, this movie is fantastic for the whole family.  My wife loves it, and so does my 3 year old daughter (This is the only movie in my animie collection that I let her watch).  Every scene is very well done.  A gripping story, well done character interaction, multiple sub plots, and fantastic cinemetography, all add up to one of the best movies I have ever scene.  There are probably only 10 to 12 movies I would give 5 stars to, and this is one of them.
B000006045|5.0|I bought this CD a while ago and I still love listening to Massive Attack's Mezzanine. The way I found out about this CD is that I heard a bit of &quot;Dissolved Girl&quot; from the Matrix, when Neo is sleeping at his computer, and I had to found out who sang that. And I came across Massive Attack and bought the CD right off Amazon after I couldn't find it anywhere. I love the semidark moods the songs pull off, or, as from &quot;Exchange&quot;, a little late night get-together. I love all of the songs, except for one, and one only, which is conincidently, &quot;Mezzanine&quot;.<BR>But everything else is perfect! You need this music!
B00004R99J|5.0|Sadly, people expect Pocahontas to be another Lion King, which it is not.  It's a much more quiet, serious, magical, more adult love story and of the recent Disney films, the one that touches me the most.  Unfortunately, the DVD transfer is terrible.<br />At least it's presented in widescreen, but on all other counts the DVD is sub-par.  The image is washed out, grainy and the colors seem to bleed a bit.  Plus the sound is a bit distant sounding at times.  I have the deluxe laserdic edition wich was a perfect transfer.  Why they didn't just use that for the DVD I'll never know.  There are a few extras included like the stroy book mode which lets you read or have the story read to you, 2 music videos, a short and simple trivia game and the obligatory trailer.<br />Reading through these reviews I don't understand why people expect this film to be historically accurate.  First of all this is Disney.  They even revise all their stories so they are more to their liking.  Secondly, it was said again and again in all of the offical information for Pocahontas that it was based on the LEGEND of Pocahontas.  Besides, it could never be historically accurate because historians themselves disagree on the actual events. Does all this mean that we should be deprived of experiencing a marvolous film that teaches compassion and the evils of bigotry?  I think not.<br />This film is Disney's first serious attempt at growing up and presenting deeper, more realistic emotions into it's films.  It was a courageous step taken in the most beautiful way.  The songs are wonderful and moving.  You're sure to be singing them long after the film has ended. My girpes with the film are it should have been longer, even more adult and the touching love song, If I Never Knew You should never have been cut.  But these quibbles are just that, taken as a whole, Pocahontas is an astonishing achievement for the new Disney, topped (posssibly) only by The Hunchback of Notre Dame.  Disney needs to grow to survive and this was an excellent frist step.  Do not let the naysayyers or the bad DVD transfer stop you from enjoying the greatest love story ever animated.  Get it on VHS if not DVD, but don't miss this film.  Enjoy!o survive and this was an excellent frist step.

B00005J6UP|3.0|I love this movie, but am disappointed with the version on DVD. It should've been the &quot;disney&quot; version with the extra footage added into the movie......the ultimate cut version it should've been. However, I do love the film and love the fact that the deleted scenes were included, as an extra..... both Cyndi videos are fantastic and I am glad Part one and two are included. I would've rated this higher had it been a version, like the disney one, that contained ALL the scenes.
6305508550|5.0|I love to watch this movie after a bad day, they way it pokes fun of the corporate morons is dead on. Everybody has a boss or knows a manager that you look at and say, &quot;how in the hell did that person get that job?&quot;
B00003CXSP|5.0|Well as DVDs go this one is pretty reasonable value for money.  I think that there is over 300 minutes of footage on the two DVDs.  There is an alternate ending and the usual deleted scenes.  I would have liked some of the great trailers, but they are lacking on this edition.<br />As far as the movie goes:  It's great, very well done all round.  Some die hard fans of the first movie may not like it.  At the end of the day this is a quality movie, which stands alone.  I enjoyed it.
0790729725|4.0|Martine Scorcese is absolutely brilliant!  Robert De Niro plays Jimmy Conway, a guy who will never be &quot;made&quot; because he is part jewish.  Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill who will also never be made because he is half jewish as well.  And Joe Pesci plays Tommy DeVito, a full Italian who will some day be the boss in Liotta's well-narrated part.  This film focuses the most on Liotta and this is the movie that no joke &quot;made&quot; all three of these talented actors.  This is also from the maker of&quot;Casino&quot;, another great film by Scorcese.  But, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is the better of the two.  Pesci roles in both films are very similar and he is funny and entertaining in both.  &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is one of my favorites and I will recommened it to just about anyone who can understand it and like it as much as I did.

B00005A46T|5.0|Ok id first like to say that this isnt slipknots 2nd album, this is there 3rd (not including the other CDs that are the same). Slipknots first album was MXPR (excuse me on the title, im not to sure on that is the spelling). It was a good CD but alot softer than there 2nd and 3rd. Anyway you can hardly reconise that the first is slipknot, after all only 2 members of the original band are in it today. <BR>Now that i got that out of the way i will review Iowa. Iowa is a very good CD, It of course has the originall Slipknot sound that cant be heard anywhere else. I will note that in this CD they took advantage more of haveing 9 members in the band to create a more complex sound than the previouse album. This long awaited CD was well worth the wait, and standing in line for 2 hours just to own it. Although It was still one of my favorite CDs, it isnt quite as good as the previous. It does come close though, i dont know what it is about it, but i just seem to think that you can never top that previous album. It was just to perfect.<BR>All in all this was still an exellent CD and i highly recommend it to anyone.
0767020308|2.0|That's Jane Austen's own take on her creation, Emma Woodhouse, and indeed whenever one studies this novel in college, that's always brought to the fore, that there's something about Emma that just keeps the reader from identifying with her and liking her. And that's why this novel, alone among Austen's books, poses the most trouble for us readers. Now, that being said up front, it should have come as no surprise to me that after  loving the film adaptations of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, and &quot;Persusaion&quot;, I should not like &quot;Emma&quot; so well. Well, it's even worse than that: I hate it!<BR>The casting of Emma, Mr. Knightley, and Lucy is all wrong! Kate Beckinsale makes a tiresome Emma, the fellow playing Mr. Knightley is always furious, as though he escaped from &quot;Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, and Samantha Morton's Lucy--you know, in the book, the whole point of Lucy is that she has only her pretty face going for her. PRETTY face, okay?  This insipid looking young woman just won't do at all. The very fact that this actress later got work playing the plain and insignificant Jane Eyre should point up that she's not a beauty.<BR>I will give the production credit, however, for a good Frank Churchill, Mr. Elton, and former parson's spinster daughter--those are all excellent characterizations.  But the faults of those other three pivotal characters are just too much to satisfy any real fan of Jane Austen's. <BR>I was greatly disappointed with this video, and wouldn't really recommend it to you.

B00004Z459|5.0|I really bought this CD because I had seen their video for &quot;Crawling&quot; so many times on MTV that the song was always in my head.  It was going to be my &quot;angry music&quot;.  But now I have to say that it is an excellent CD and worth the 13-18 bucks for it!
0743201140|5.0|I'm a coach -- personal, business and EQ -- and I find this book to be an invaluable tool in my practice. The nomenclature for the strengths is wonderful, and makes sense. As a helping professional, I can generally see what's going on with a client, but can't see the forest for the trees, and wasn't that easily able to describe my own strengths. Taking the test myself was most illuminating and I found out, with some feedback, that I wasn't really portraying my stengths in relations with others. I immediately compared it with the profile of someone I was working with, and it made it clear to us both the one area in which we were 'clashing'. Tension eased as we saw each other for what we were, and it's been smooth sailing. It's a shortcut to understand the person you're managing, relating to, living with, or working with. No single assessment is going to explain a complex living being, but this one will put together a lot of pieces for you and for your client, employee or S.O. The book is very easy to read; clear, well written and informative. Yes, we DID need words for strengths. It's time we quit focusing on &quot;weaknesses&quot;. Everyone has them, but everyone also has strengths, and, as the authors say, your best chance at attaining excellence is by increasing your strengths, not shoring up your weaknesses, and it's also a much surer path to contentment.

Since I'm an EQ coach, I delight in giving it to the pressured executive who hasn't touched a children's book in a long, long time, or the harried housewife who's forgotten the adventure of it all, or the ivory-towered philosopher who thinks it all beneath him.

B00004TRD8|4.0|Let me say, I do like this movie. Linda Hamilton never looked<br />better. But I prefer the original. I do not like Arnold as a<br />&quot;good&quot; Terminator. I do not care for Edward Furlong - a tad too<br />whiney for a &quot;hero of the future&quot; and although you can see that<br />all that money is up on the screen, the immediacy and callousness<br />of the original seems lost to me.<br />I'm sure that many people will have given this a 5-star review.<br />I think I will reserve that for the original.
6304288433|5.0|Halloween 2 is a great movie, which expands on the original's story but lacks the atmosphere or terror and replaces it with blood and gore. Picking up precisely where &quot;Halloween&quot; left off, Laurie Strode is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital after being attacked by Michael Myers.  This movie had way more blood than the Original HALLOWEEN did! Thats 1 reason why Halloween 2 is better than &quot;HALLOWEEN&quot;.  1 thing I hated so so much about the original was that.... it was so dark in every single scene.<BR>Halloween 2 was very colorful and well lighted !!! Also Halloween 2 had better actors than those teens in<BR>The first &quot;HALLOWEEN&quot;.  one thing that I hated about this movie was that The MASK was so so.....HORIBAL LOOKING !  it made me want to cry everytime i saw the mask  =(<BR>    If you never saw this movie.

B000050FEN|5.0|To quote Shakespeare.....<br />&quot;...the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and<br />now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to<br />show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very<br />age and body of the time his form and pressure&quot;.<br />Neither Art nor Movies have any business being in the<br />&quot;redeeming value&quot; business. That was for the Middle Ages<br />where the Lord of the Manor's brother was local priest and<br />the illiterate peasants could be kept in line by paintings<br />and sculptures depicting the suffering of Christ and by firey<br />sermons intending to reinforce the social order and tell them<br />that they would have it better &quot;in the next life&quot;.<br />That &quot;Seven&quot; has as some reviewers say, &quot;no redeeming value&quot;<br />is for me one of its strongest and most telling points.<br />I love also that it was pretty much unpredictable. All those<br />reviewers who claim to have seen the ending, must be better<br />movie watchers than I. Because they forget the one law of<br />American movies - IT MUST HAVE A HAPPY ENDING.<br />Because if something has a happy ending, WE CAN MAKE A SEQUEL.<br />Spacey was excellent in this movie. If you know the ending, the<br />dialogue with Pitt in the police car is just too much.<br />This movie really does hold a mirror up to the mind of a killer<br />and it is disturbing and the images are disturbing and the<br />murders are disturbing. But that is what it is trying to show.<br />As to it being too slow. The pace is absolutely correct, slow,<br />slow, mundane, &quot;the life of a simple man&quot; and then SPLAT!<br />horrific murders. The juxtaposition of the banal and the<br />visceral make this movie work - in spades.<br />In the special edition DVD, I don't remember flipping the disc.<br />Are other reviewers referring to an earlier release? If all you<br />have to complain about the movie is flipping the disc, I think<br />that says something about you, not the film.<br />The special edition DVD is so cool. The second disc of bonus<br />features is beyond excellent and the alternate endings were for<br />me, a revelation. But I do think the ending in the movie is<br />perfect as released.br />The special edition DVD is so cool.

0800141660|4.0|This is a &quot;chicks movie&quot;, but really in the best sense of the<br />word. This is a movie to purge the male thirst for &quot;action&quot;. You<br />have to truly have a heart of stone not to enjoy this movie.<br />Kate Winslet was I believe only 19 when she made this movie -<br />what a performance. I found Hugh Grant's performance a little too<br />mannered, but Alan Rickman was excellent - as he is in just about<br />everything he does - from the bad guy in &quot;Die Hard&quot; to Obidiah<br />Slope in the BBC's production of &quot;Barchester Towers&quot;.<br />But the stand out performance is Emma Thompson's, holding in all<br />that emotion. Truly superb. When she thinks Marianne is going to<br />die and her inner resolve slips - that is truly some of the best<br />acting of our time.<br />This movie is wonderful. And no one gets shot.

The cimematography is stunning, the soundtrack is haunting, the story line is all about love and war and what it means to be a human being.  I think the critics saw another movie!  I have never been so shocked by their reviews in comparison to what I saw on the screen!  Far and away the best movie of the summer...only &quot;Memento&quot; offering it any competition. All I can say is that this movie must have suffered from some sort of &quot;Titanic&quot; backlash...and that is truly a disservice to this great movie.  &quot;Titanic&quot; is great in its own right, but so is &quot;Pearl Harbor.&quot;  <br />I have visited Pearl Harbor several times...and look forward to the next time I am fortunate enough to visit, as I learned new information about that day...and because of the film, have a deeper sense of the loss and devastation that took place.  The film is dignified in its sensitive yet powerful re-enactment of one of the most shattering moments in American history.  Don't listen to the reviewers...they were wrong on this one.

B00004SCX6|4.0|i have this cd and i really like it. it's just basically a simple, easy-going, pop artist that creates bubblegum music and Britney's good at what she does.the song &quot;oops i did it again&quot; had a really catchy chorus and tune but i didn't exactly like the message that the song was saying. i mean she's playing with real human lives and just comming out and saying &quot;oops&quot; giggling and walking away. but like i said the beat and tune are good. &quot;stronger&quot; is a better song, much more to my liking bc it sends out a more positive message saying that she doesn't need a guy to depend on and she can survive without one and she feels more stronger and independant. the video to this song was really cool. it's probably my favorite video. you can just feel the energy vibe and the message strongly expressing itself. &quot;don't go knocking on my door&quot; is more of an R&amp;B sound that i personally don't care for but this song was fun. you can tell that this song was definately just made for fun. &quot;satisfaction&quot; i thought was actually good. i think she did a good remake of it. she did slow it down a bit but it's still good. &quot;don't let me be the last to know&quot; is ok. i like the beat to that song but that's about it. &quot;What u see is what u get&quot; is my favorite song on the album. it's a song that just makes u want to get up and dance with a brush in your hand being used as a microphone. the chorus is catchy as well as the beat and the lyrics. &quot;lucky&quot; was a cute song. it's not about the whole love, break my heart, i need you baby deal. it's talking about something different. the chorus and beat i think is catchy and cute. the video to this song is creative too. &quot;one kiss from you&quot; i think has a cool chorus. but that's about it. the chorus is what makes this song. &quot;where are you now&quot; is one of the slow songs. it's pretty and i find myself listening to it five times in a row. and &quot;can't make you loveme&quot; is ok. it's another song that u can just have fun with and dance too; really nothing special. &quot;When your eyes say it&quot; is probably the only song that i hate and just have to skip every time. it's boring, slow, and uninteresting. &quot;Dear diary&quot; is a cute, short , pretty song. it expresses the feelings that most girls have and teenage girls could probably relate a lot to this song. britney co-wrote it. everybody that i know likes this song even people that hate britney so, this song's a keeper. well all in all the album is cool and fun. something u can listen to when you need to get up and dance.
B000002UJQ|5.0|At the end of the last century, Q Magazine in England did a poll for the best British Album of the 20th century.  About 225,000 people responded.  At the top of the list was Radiohead, and the album was OK Computer.<br />This album is, indeed, the most incredible album I've ever heard.  The textures and soundscapes range from ethereal to pure, angry rock.  It lashes out with abusive guitar in Paranoid Android and Electioneering.  It lulls your fears with the saccharine lullabye of No Suprises.  It chills your bones with the dark, neurotic Climbing Up the Walls.  And it rips at your soul with fingers of desperation in Exit Music (For a Film).  It is a pinnacle work for an incredible group of musicians.  Thom Yorke's vocals pull at every emotion you're conscious of.  The guitar work is impeccable, as you would expect from Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien, and the arrangements of strings, brass, percussion, and electronic samples and blips are placed with a composer's precision.  It never seems like overdone or just simply noise, although that's exactly what it may be.  In a way, it all just makes sense.  If you already are a fan of this band, you probably already own this album and this review isn't for you.  But if you haven't experienced Radiohead beyond Creep or perhaps one of the great tracks off The Bends that were released as singles, you owe it to yourself to buy this album.
B00003CY3W|5.0|On a recent trip to NYC I was able to watch this unique piece of modern art. Staring the confuse,lonely and angry Enid and (Thora Birch from American Beauty) Rebeca (Scarlett Johansson from the Horse Whisper) as a relatively more &quot;normal&quot; girl. Both of them  are living the last days of High School and in all honesty they are uncertain about their future, having wished only for a dead end job and an apartment they soon realize things are really not that easy in the so called &quot;real world&quot;. We then have this cool, strange and average guy named Seymour (Steve Buscemi from Fargo) who collects odd things, has no social live and lives with a fat guy and spends weekends selling used things on a garage sale outside his house. The three of them met thanks to a cruel joke that the girls thought and got it done, Enid has no idea of the further impact that Seymour would have in her own life. So slowly we see how their existence changes as Enid summer course moves on.<BR>The movie delivers a strong message as you can see how terrible, sad, funny and bizarre growing old is really all about. <BR>You get the idea of the despair, and emptyness that can be, searching for a place you can called your own.<BR>Ghost World is that movie that resumes the feeling of a particular day of you life when you feel or behave in some way, and there really is no explanation on why you are doing anything <BR>As other guys out there put it´s not a movie for everyone, not that is was meant to be a huge sucess, I think that the makers must be quite happy because they were able to develop this project and show it to the rest of the world. The team of writer- director manages to create really funny moments without losing any sense of the drama it was intended. I would love to see another colaboration between this two original artists<BR>I feel I can relate a lot to Enid feelings and attitudes.<BR>I really loved been able to seen some similarities of my own existence on screen.
B000002KDB|5.0|Emmylou Harris released her first major-label album in 1975 and she's still making great music today.  Although this is actually officially her second album (the first one, recorded for a small label, is unavailable), it's considered her debut.  'Pieces of the Sky' features ten great songs, almost all of them covers, with no two written by the same people.  The only tune Harris co-wrote, &quot;Boulder to Birmingham,&quot; has become her conert signature tune and is still a wonderful song.  It's amazing how condfident Emmylou sounds singing such a wide variety of material ranging from Merle Haggard (&quot;Bottle Let Me Down&quot;) to Dolly Parton (&quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot;) to the Beatles (&quot;For No One&quot;).  Harris somehow manages to make each of these covers her own.  On every song she sounds like a seasoned veteran, not a first-timer.  Emmylou Harris has recorded several great albums, but if you are a new listener, this is the place to start.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Surprisingly warm and sentimental sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; finds everyone's favourite serial killer setting up shop as the curator of a posh European art museum, while simultaneously falling in love with FBI agent Starling from the earlier film!  Nicely complemented by some of Celine Dion's prettiest songs, this bullseye sequel is sure to rekindle magical memories of first love.  Hopkins is compelling as the museum curator.

B00005JKHP|5.0|Greetings fellow Star Trek Fans. As you all know, we live and die by the future. While I understand many comments made by people regarding this series and movies, and especially this movie, there are a few things you must remember. No one was prepared for the Star Trek Phenomenon, including Paramount. It's true, The motion picture dragged a bit at times, but would have preferred no movie? They were setting up the series. Remember, this was a 60's short lived series supposedly. We live in the now with fuuristic effects, with a Lucas and a Spielberg. They had none of this. They did the best they had with what they had to work with. They were succesful in launching a new movie series, and now the transition to a 6th? Television series? Remember, the core is good. This new promised DVD wil have all the deleted scenes (finally) as well as the director's cut exploring among other things, The development of Scotty's nephew's character. I am anxious to see it. I'm sure all fans will want to buy the new DVD, and see the way the director originally intended it. Maybe that version is better.
0783232039|5.0|This movie was great. Not as good and suspenseful as one and two, but still very good. As everyone who saw all the movies knows, 3 just plain .... It was the worst one in the series. However this one is a lot more funnier and the kills are awsome. I really just wish it was more suspenseful. However this movie had the best ending of all of them. If you know the ending, you must be waiting for a sequel just like me.
0140189378|5.0|Just wanted to say that although I can see why some of these people say nothing happend in this book, nothing could be further from the truth.  Seize the Day is a book that has no action, no last miniute courthouse confessional, but is one of the most moving portraits of the American male I have read since Death of a Salesman.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is the #2 highest grossing movie in Japan for a reason (it's right behind &quot;Titanic&quot;). It's yet another masterpiece from studio ghibli. The voice acting is great, so those of you who hate watching subtitled films (which are often the only decent versions of many import flicks from Japan) are not left out in the cold, and the action will keep anyone glued to the screen while the story will keep you slavering for more. I highly recommend it!
B00003CXD0|3.0|This is an excellent film. It's been around nearly 20 years and what features do they give us for such a special movie and special performances??   NONE....NONE.  I don't really consider production notes a &quot;special&quot; feature.  In my opinion, special features &quot;move&quot; and talk.  <br />Who out there thinks that TOOTSIE should not only have commentary but also deleted scenes, a gag reel (can you imagine how funny a gag reel would be for this movie?), a nice featurette, and for God's sake, at LEAST a freakin' theatrical trailer!!  That's right, they couldn't even come up with a theatrical trailer.  I know that Columbia had been planning an anniversary special release for Tootsie for about two years now.  This is what they come up with?  <br />I'm sure that what happened was, someone at Columbia noticed how so many DVDs are being rereleased, sometimes only a few months after their initial release.  Hence, making consumers buy the same thing over again.  Ya know, there are a sea of good movies out there and people work hard for their money.  Is there any way that these movie distributors can stop being so selfish and just do it right the first time?<br />This DVD has a good transfer.  the sound is okay but nothing to write home about.<br />Just watch out folks, in 2002, they'll be some sort of &quot;Ultimate&quot;, &quot;transcendant&quot; edition of TOOTSIE that will include all the features that it should.<br />What do I do with this one, you ask?
B00003CXSP|3.0|Jody Foster was right in choosing to skip this misguided sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;  &quot;Hannibal&quot; is Anthony Hopkins show and he remains delighfully twisted as the ultimate cannibal serial killer- but the plot is just an excuse for grotesque set pieces. In orde for us to sympathise which such a demented psycho we are given a more monstreous villain- a hediously disfigured child molestor who is obssessed with getting his revenge on the good Doctor Lecter- but this revenge is elaboratly preposterous-the entire film seems to be an attempt at classy Grand Guinol-but the results are gorgeously revolting- the final shocking dinner scene is simply silly.
0767849493|5.0|I've seen this movie three times, and I love it. It has a great cast, is very well written, and extremely funny. I reccommend it!
B00005AAFS|5.0|of course its not all about the american music scene les talk about something more important like th Briutish heavy meatl music seen i mean mutter has everything being a korn and marilyn manson fan myself Rammstein are my fav band the are very talented and i hope to see them when in london on Oct6th. <br />ive seen there shows on tv amazing what you can do with leather leashs and 6 guys! they mix classical with metal with orcestra and melodic tunes in a way unknown to be so amazing. i just cant believe Papa roach won best video over rammstein's sonne in the kerrang awards. i mean whats that about? <BR>anyway im just gonna leave with &quot;rammstein, i speak for England when i say you rule!!!!!&quot;
B00003CXDZ|5.0|SUPERB. Music,Great for the modern generation. Lighting efect, contrasts and editing, Fantastic.The actors Oscar for them. I just came out of the theater with hope in seeing it for sale.I guess I will have to wait until it comes out. I still say GREAT. I went to see it thinking I was going to see a new version of the Jose Ferrer, how wrong I was. All diferent.
B000001FY9|5.0|LEGEND demonstrates that music can provide a religious experience regardless of what one believes.  One only has to be human to feel the heart and soul in this music.  Certainly One Love/People Get Ready best epitomizes this notion, but it is equally true with No Woman, No Cry, Stir It Up, Get Up, Stand Up, et al.  This is truly a great introduction to Bob Marley And The Wailers, perhaps even too great, for it is a hard act to follow.  If you enjoy this album, especially the live No Woman, No Cry, I highly recommend LIVE and BABYLON BY BUS, both excellent examples of the power of an unforgettable live performance in which performer and audience turn something great into something that borders on divine.
6303965415|5.0|This 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is subtle and understated and simply superb.  Amanda Root is a perfect Anne Elliott; faded and overlooked at the beginning.  You can see just how much she's let herself go, even with the stooped stature and limp hair.  And you feel the mortification, along with her, when her former fiance, Capt. Wentworth, dashingly played by Ciaran Hinds, sees her in this state.  <BR>The movie does move rather slowly, but this is it's power.  Even the score of piano music by Chopin conveys how slowly and heavily the time has moved for Anne.  And once you see the transformation that occurs, physically, for Anne, it's even easier to understand how re-awakened hope has transformed her spiritually.  <BR>One big difference is the director's use of BOTH the endings Austen wrote to illustrate Frederick's dilemma.  And the ending is one of the most romantic scenes I've ever watched.  <BR>I highly recommend it to devotees of Jane Austens's work.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|A great job From manu chao.From the merry blues to the infnita tristeza you can listen music from many places of the world.Close ur eyes and you will travel to cuba,jamaica,mexico,etc.Music isn't only new sound (for Mr Bobby and Homens that use sample from Bongo bong) its the feelings that the artist try to give u.<br />MANU KEEP up THE GOOD WORK
B00005MEPV|1.0|What was originally a brilliantly all-inclusive sci-fi epic has become just another vehicle for selling toys and posters to teenagers. Did this series really need poop jokes, or an hour-long go-kart-on-spped race scene? Though visually stunning at times, this movie is a sad disappointment, destroying what could have been an amazing opportunity to continue a powerful story.
B000002G1Y|4.0|John Hiatt's loudest album, you've got to be in the mood for it. When I'm not, I just pick out the exceptional tracks and leave the rest for a loud day. The title track is one of those: a quintessential Hiatt song with howling guitars and sassy, unusual lyrics. &quot;Old Habits&quot; is the best song on the album though, and almost worth the price on its own. Hiatt gets into an unmatched swamp-groove on this track. Perfect. The rest are mostly good, if sometimes uncharacteristically lacking in light and shade. Only &quot;The Wreck of the Barbie Ferrari&quot; makes me want to skip on to the next track. So, if you like the Hiatt style, and can stand the extra noise, you'll probably like this well enough, but it wouldn't be my choice of your first ever Hiatt album.
B000002X2B|5.0|THIS C/D, AND I DO HAVE THE ORIGINAL VINYL, IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE BEST GUITAR/PIANO ALBUMS IN THE HISTORY OF ROCK &amp; ROLL.  STARTING WITH TRACK 5 TO THE END, IT'S THE BEST.  ONE LISTEN WITH HEADPHONES YOU WILL BE CONVINCED.  YOU CAN HEAR GRACE SLICK A LOT IN THE FOREFRONT AND THE BACKGROUND WITH LOTS OF HIDDEN GUITAR STRINGS.  BUY IT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
B00005K3LU|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  Since I didn't get this DVD for my birthday, I'm gonna have to buy it myself!!
B00000IMTF|5.0|This is the classic metal album for Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow,<BR>before axemeister and taskmaster Blackmore turned the group membership into a game of musicial chairs.The lineup of Ronnie James Dio(vocals ),Ritchie Blackmore(lead guitar),Tony Carey(keyboards),Cozy Powell(drums),and Jimmy Bain(bass guitar) finally broke free the the Deep Purple sound and influence that pervaded the debut album(RITCHIE BLACKMORE'S RAINBOW) and stamped the musical world with their own unique Wizards and Warriors rock.It is this lineup and album that remains the classic with fans of the band.<br />TAROT WOMAN - Tony Carey takes us on an interstellar flight with his keyboard intro,before Ritchie's opening riffs bring us back down to earth,waiting for Cozy to pound us into the ground.The first time I heard Dio's voice on this track,I became a Rainbow fan.<br />RUN WITH THE WOLF - Great bluesy number with amazing fretwork from Blackmore and great lyrics sung with menacing conviction by rock's Napoleon.&quot;There's a break in the sky . . .something evil's passing by&quot;.<BR>   <BR>STARSTRUCK - Tale of an overzealous and overbearing groupie.Dio spits out the words with exasperative fury.Powell's pounding around his kit is a joy to a skinpounder like myself.<br />DO YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES - Straightforward chunky rocker that showcases the bedrock team of Powell and Bain.Great lines: &quot;I know a rich man,a poor man . . .I know how to talk to a king&quot;.<br />STARGAZER - The best Rainbow track ever . . .bar none.All the band play a hand in the epic telling of the rise and fall of a Wizard,as witnessed by his slaves/servants/subjects.Blackmore's guitar solo has a Middle Eastern flavour to it.Quite possibly Dio's best lyric and vocal performance of his long career.The orchestra buried in the mix,when released,lift the track hig into the stratosphere where in remains for the next track.<br />LIGHT IN THE BLACK - A glorious excuse for a long jam session.<BR>All band members get a chance tosolo and shine.Tony Carey's fingers fly over his keyboards.Brilliant way to end this landmark in Heavy Metal.
B000002KCI|5.0|I bought this album (vinyl) in 1976 when I was 20 and it helped me through a tough summer.  One of Neil Young's best, only second to &quot;Tonight's the Night&quot; from 1975 which in my opinion is his absolute very best.  Zuma is full of great songs written, played and sung with a lot of heart.  For the true Neil Young fan...this one's a must.  &quot;You're such a beautiful fish. Floppin' on the summer sand.  Lookin' for a wave you've missed.  When another one is close at hand.  You're such a stupid girl!&quot;
0792839730|4.0|This movie is a very good war movie featuring an all-star cast including Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, and Sean Connery. It takes place a few months after the invasion at Normandy and is about Operation Market Garden, a plan the Allies devised to win the war much quicker. If you like good war movies, than this is probably worth buying.
B000002J6F|5.0|I wasn't much of a Steve Stills fan until I recently bought this...  WOW !  This is a great great CD.  I was drawn to this by Chris Hillman's being one of the musicians.  Chris is probablyl the most under-rated musician and composer in the business.  His country influence, vocals and efforts are essential to this.  Now I'm a Still fan too !  There are four (4) sections to this CD with different styles in each section...21 or 22 songs in all and it's perfect.
B00005M4JS|5.0|What could you dream of better devil than chocolate, and during Lent! Really great. Fantastic spirit, super script, the actors are very well played and it is not for the &quot;one star&quot; but for all actors... I strongly recommend you to see it!

0679777547|4.0|&quot;This mystery is considered insoluble for the very same reasons that should lead one to consider it soluble&quot;<br />The Club Dumas follows the adventures of Lucas Corso, a cross between a mercenary and an antique book dealer.  He has been given the task of authenticating a rare book - one that can be used to summon Lucifer himself.<br />But, as Corso begins to uncover the secrets of the book and its printer, he is involved in another mystery.  He is followed by characters that bear such a striking resemblance to Dumas's most famous serial, the Three Musketeers, that he begins to delve deeper into the fiction that has become his existence.<br />The Club Dumas is a fascinating read.  It is an adventure story in its own right.  Woven into the text, however, is commentary on intertextualism, the meaning of literature, and man's relationship with the occult.  Perez-Reverte does an especially good job of setting the scenes which are presented in the book - the reader feels the antiquity and beauty of the European villages which are the setting.  Overall, a fascinating read and highly recommended.
B00005ATZT|4.0|When I first saw 'The Fugitive', I was hoping that it didn't fall into the trap of silliness that most TV-show based feature films have fallen into (remember 'Car 54', or 'Wild Wild West'?). Needless to say, I was more than pleasantly surprised to see that it went WAY beyond my low expectations! Great moments of suspense, action, and plot twists galore!<BR><BR>Harrison Ford's been knocked for not putting much 'feeling' into some of his roles. But if there are emotions he does do well, it's desperation and determined stoicism with a touch of sarcasm... a perfect fit for a fugitive out to clear his name. As well, Tommy Lee Jones is a lock as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard- he plays the character's somewhat cocky and no-nonsense attitude to perfection. He also gets the best lines, and a pretty good supporting cast playing his U.S. Marshal Service cohorts (including the recently- recognized Joe Pantoliano). It's scenery-chewing at it's best, and definitely an Oscar-worthy perfomance. <BR><BR> Their performances of the two main characters and antagonists is so compelling that, like my fellow reviewers have stated before, I was rooting for the both of them throughout the presentation. It's two 'good guys' against each other, with one helping lead the other to the same end! <BR><BR> When I heard about the Special Edition DVD release, I was kinda bummed. I'd already spent a few bucks on the original release, and never anticipated the possibility of an enhanced version. But, thanks to those wonderful buyers on eBay, I got a good return on my original disc at a minimal loss, and grabbed a copy of the new one. <BR><BR> The new  disc isn't half-bad, but doesn't quite match up to the standards of other fully-loaded DVD fare as `T2 Ultimate Edition' or `The Abyss'. It features teasers, trailers, and a few behind-the-scenes bits, including the setup &amp; shooting of the train wreck. Davis even discusses a `flub' following the wreck that was cut out of the original video version, but wasthen digitally corrected and restored in this DVD release! And no, I'm not gonna tell you about it- you'll have to see it for yourself! <BR><BR> The commentary track by director Andrew Davis and Tommy Lee Jones was not one of the better feature-length commentaries I've experienced. There are parts where neither of them speak for a couple minutes on end, almost like they didn't have that much to say about the movie in the first place. Jones' commentary was minimal, with mostly throwaway-type observations that didn't really add much to the track. <BR><BR> And now, my biggest gripe: Warner is STILL using cardboard snap cases for their digital discs! You'd think they'd've gotten out of the DVD Stone Age by now...<BR><BR>'Late
B00002NDB1|1.0|In a music world characterized by change, Maiden follows along.  X Factor and Virtual Xi really are departures from Maiden's norm, and it's not just about Blaze's poor singing.  Now, I am not terrified of change--if the change is good--and neither should you.  I particularly liked X Factor, with its intense dark, gothic sound and themes.  It was slower and deeper than previous albums, an album characterized more by tone and feeling than by crazy guitar solos.  Fine, I can accept a lack of crazy guitar solos--the 80s were filled with high-pitched squealing guitars, and even I (as a lead guitar player) got tired of listening to some of Maiden's solos. I think X Factor was a darn good album.  Now, Virtual Xi is different.  Virtual Xi lacks BOTH of these components: a passionate tone and good guitar work.  The songs, from a musical perspective, are not as tight as other Maiden works (before and including X Factor)... there are, as other reviewers noted, some good riffs, but they just repeat these riffs over and over, and then without any good transitions or hooks move into other riffs.... it's as though they composed these songs in different pieces during TV commercials and not with their full attention. Good songs aren't just comprised of good riffs--they are comprised of good arrangement.  So Virtual Xi lacks passion, it lacks fire, and it lacks real musical creativity. (And some of the songs are just so cheesy). The arragements aren't good, and for an album this new, the sound engineering just isn't up-to-par. This album is a sore disappointment, and it has nothing with our new Bruce-wannabe.
B000000H5J|5.0|I bought this cd a while ago and I still listen to it more than any other. This is the best cd ever recorded and fear factory's best by far.  A must by for anyone. Metal fan or no..... <br />I have spoken
B00004TH7Z|5.0|We all knew that Maiden was returning to their roots, but damn... I had no idea that the album was going to be that good. Very rarely do I find that an album lives up to media &amp; fan hype before release. This album is characterized by good songs, great riffs, excellent hooks and transitions (as opposed to Virtual Xi, maiden's worst album in this respect), very few cheesy lines, and great sound engineering. The harmonies are awesome and the solos are what I'd expect of a talented 80s metal band. I can't say that this album exactly recaptures early Maiden spirit and tone (it's a bit different than stuff like Powerslave and Fear of the Dark), but it's similar and MORE MATURE. Their musical ability has obviously matured, not that they are faster or heavier sounding now, but they cover a broad range of musical techniques in this album. They borrowed some sounds and techniques from every album. These techniques include heavy bass interludes, well harmonized and melodic interludes, shredding scales, that low E-string gallup riff so well loved by metal fans, great sustain (sometimes when you slow down a song and sustain your notes you get a great effect), and great arpeggiation. Bottom line is that from a musical perspective, this album is richer, more eclectic, better arranged, and all-out catchier than any of their previous albums. Now, of course, if you like this album will depend on your tastes. If you only like, for example, Killers (which is very different from Maiden's other albums), you won't like Brave New World much b/c it only incorporates a little of the Killers sound. The best way to describe this album is: SUMMARY. It is not an ingenious step forward by any means, but it takes the best of each album and wraps these things in new arrangement... a brave step in a Brave New World-- up the irons!!
6302453356|5.0|Oh wow, I just viewed this movie for the first time since I was little! What a great movie!! I always it enjoyed it as a boy but now as an adult I can again say WOW!  After the movie was over I felt like all I had to do was think of a wonderful thing and woosh I would be wisked away by pixie dust and have incredible fights with Captain Hook! This movie may not be Disney, but Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts, and the rest of this wonderful cast truly bring the adventures of Peter Pan(ning) to life! Definatly a must by for the whole family!

0380002930|5.0|If you are of any age and hate to read you must read this book a soon as possible. Before I read this book I hated to read because I thought it was boring a dull, but after I read Watership Down I found out what an exciting world some authors can bring you into.  <BR>   I mean I at first got this book for summer reading (for school) because my grandmother said it was a great book, but she did not tell me it was 400 and somethin' pages.  So, I said Britt you have to read a book it might as well be a 400 and somethin' page book.  <BR>   As soon as I started reading I was automatically I was pulled into this wonderous and magical world of rabbits. I mean Richard Adams makes you feel you are one of Hazel's mighty crew, and because of that I plowed through this book in three weeks, which is incredibly fast for me. I recomend this book to anyone of any age who does not like to read or loves to read.<br />Summary: Fiver, Hazel's little brother, has this horrible preminition of something horrible hapening to their warren (group of holes or a rabbit comminity).  Hazel tells the cheif rabbit, he does not believe them, and will not leave thier warren.  So, Fiver convences Hazel to get a small group of rabbits together and leave the warren. You will have to read the book to find out all of the adventures they go through looking for a new warren.
B000002VC3|4.0|If your looking for some easy listening well produced music then buy this CD. Alan Parsons is very talented and produces some great CD's. Great vocals and incredible music. Great when listened to kind of loud or on the headphones.
0790729628|1.0|Pass on this one.  I want the narration and I love the happy ending. It is a classic, with the narration, and a bore without. Someone force Warners into releasing the original version.<br />This is one case where the Studio was right.
B00005LB9O|5.0|Never heard of Travis until today. Listened to a few cuts off this CD at Borders and new right away this was special. This is a very talented group. Finally I have found some new music that I really love from the first listen. Tomorrow I am going to buy their other CD's. If you are looking for some new music don't pass up this band. The songwriting is very good as well as the music. I can't really compare them to any bands out there today. If your as old as I am (47) and like pop/rock music then this is highly recommended. You will love it. DON'T PASS THIS UP, IT'S WONDERFUL.
0446608955|3.0|This was a pleasant book to read, though the entire story was quite predictable. From the moment the Landon begins describing Jamie....well, most readers will know that this &quot;bad boy&quot; will soon lose his heart to the &quot;good girl.&quot; I don't want to say anything about the ending, so as not to spoil it, but most readers will see it coming. This novel lacks any tension or mystery. We know what will happen -- the pleasure lies in watching it unfold.<BR><BR><BR>The story is spiritual with a Christian message. This is the first Nicholas Sparks book that I've read, so I don't know if all his novels are oriented towards religion. I was expecting a love story, but the emphasis on church and religion surprised me. I think the book will probably be most meaningful to Christians. As a Jewish person, I found it somewhat unreal. The &quot;bad&quot; characters were revealed to be quite harmless and good at heart. The &quot;good&quot; characters were beyond human good - Jamie is described as angelic, and so she is. <BR><BR><BR>It is a sweet book, though. And I read it quickly, in one day. It is not at all suggestive or sexual, and is appropriate reading for all ages.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Very well formated, a must see for Children and Adults alike. My family loved it #1 on list to buy for Christmas buy it not a bad price either.
B00003CXP1|5.0|To put it simply: Requiem for a dream is a masterful and creative piece of cinematic brilliance.<br />Jared Leto plays plays a young man living in New York City who is plagued with a hungry and relentless Heroin addiction, which demands to be fed. His mother (Ellen Burstyn) is addicted to diet pills. This powerful and creative movie shows the decent of these two central characters until they hit bottom. <br />Amazing screen and camera work make this an extremely interesting film, which at no time becomes boring. I highly recommend this film and personally believe that every parent should allow their children to view this film in the hopes of installing some kind of fear of drugs in them.
6305161992|4.0|If your making a Brandon Lee collection Showdown in Little Tokyo<br />is one of his good one's to have. Brandon's best movies are Showdon, Rapid Fire and The Crow, I also enjoyed Legacy of Rage.<br />One movie that is so bad of his is Laser Mission. Brandon does a good job in the movie Laser Mission but the movie over all is [bad]. I got the DVD because you can't go wrong with amazon [price]. But Showdon in Little Tokyo is a real fun action movie to watch.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have probably listened to this album 100 times, and yet it feels incomplete somehow.  So why do I give it five stars?  Because I have listened to it 100 times.  It just gets better and better with each listen eventually becoming a masterpiece.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is an awesome movie and I'm sure you can find many positive reviews for it already.  I just felt like infoeming people on the dvd version.  Before I go into the dvd features I want to say this is the kind of movie you'll want to see multiple times so it's worth owning in any form.  The dvd version is even better.  The picture looks great the movie sounds very good.  The features are less than I was hoping for but still a nice showing.  There's an interview featurette with the director, the short story the movie was based on, a copy of the webpage and a few trailers.  I wish there had been a commentary of some sorts but even without one, this is a must have.  You won't be let down by this dvd by any means.  Buy and Enjoy!
6305752672|5.0|All the matches were great with the exception of the TV Title<br />Match and Goldberg Finally won back the World Title.Disco/Leroux<br />was a awesome Cruiserweight title bout.
B00005M4JS|5.0|From the first moment the 'husband' tasted the sweets, then poured the bag down his throat my husband and I knew we wanted to find these chocolats.  This movie is a sensual, visual, witty feast.  Read the reviews if you must, but take my word for it, this movie is excellent.  I didn't even know the plot when I rented it.  :)
044022165X|4.0|The Rainmaker follows the same pattern of a majority of the author's other books.  they are full of suspense, a page - turner, and a battle of the little guy verses the big corporations.  The Rainmaker follows the same pattern except for the addition of the woman the attorney falls in love with throughout the court case. Overall, a captivating book that does John Grisham fans justice.

0060934700|4.0|This is the first book that I have read from this author and I am highly impressed.  Finally, a book where you can get a glimpse of how an author comes up with his stories and what they may mean.  The best story has to be the &quot;Murder Mysteries.&quot;  You will want to read it more than once to locate the clues hidden in the story.  I am looking forward to reading more of his works.
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|The scary thing about \\"Scary Movie\\" is that it is aimed to a strong audience of American (As in America the Continent, not the USA, duh!) teenagers and young adults with no sense of good taste and a preference for toilet humor instead of some good comedy. I'm glad I didn't have to pay from my pocket to see this one. <br /> Call me an antiquarian if so much you want to, but with the sole exception of a few scattered jokes, there is nothing of much appeal in here for anyone with a high self-esteem. (Yes, this movie is THAT bad) The \\"jokes\\" are all in the classical North American tradition and this is enough to make you think for a second time before venturing in. That's right my good sir, we have everything ranging from fart jokes to gross sex and everything in between. The only thing this movie is capable to do, is to show the importance 90% of North American teens give to sex instead of other, far more important, issues. (Well, the horror movies this movie tried to \\"spoof\\" already show such given importance, anyway) <br />  The producers, director and screenwriter(s) seem to be unable to spot the difference between the disgusting and the genuinely funny, and knowing that there are people out there who find this funny gives me the creeps. After all, how stupid do you need to be to think that a penis that ejaculates like a hog house is funny?<br />   Case closed.
B000005HN6|5.0|That's the only way I can describe Orchid.  You can't just sit down and pick apart Opeth's music, you just sit there and get lost in awe to it's beauty.  As with every other majestic Opeth release Orchid has it's influences but transcends every genre of music used to label particular bands today.<br />Opeth has very fastly risin to be my 2nd favorite band just below Radiohead.  As I said before it's hard to review Opeth because you really can't explain their music.  It transcends words, you just have to experience it.  The only way I can really rleate the albums is to say which is the best.  And IMO it goes Morningrise, Blackwater Park, Orchid, Still Life, My Arms Your Hearse.  But every one of them is amazing, if you ever find one at a local record store snatch it up immediatly you won't be dissapointed.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Yes, yes it is... and I've never seen the movie... the music stands perfectly alone... I love techno, and classical music and here Bjork mixes the two perfectly (maybe a bit more classical in most of the songs however)... I've Seen it All, the duet with Bjork and Thom Yorke is particularly stirring, but the highlight for me is the song In The Musicals... however, there are no bad tracks here... from the Overture straight through to the final song, it's all very beautlful and brilliant... maybe one day if I see the movie in a story somewhere I'll rent it, but I find I don't need that to enjoy this music... as with any good soundtrack, it can stand on it's own as an album... Passion, Peter Gabriels soundtrack to the movie The Last Temptation of Christ is maybe my favorite album of all time, and I've never seen that movie either... this album Selmasongs is absolutely stunning... definately check this out... similar to Homogenic, but in my opinion is better...
0671024256|5.0|I have to admit that this is my first Stephen King book, and it most certainly isnt my last. It also helped me make the decision to become a writer.<BR>The book is written in several parts, the first part, his memior, is good enough to stand as a story on its own, then he goes into detail about what he believes makes a good writer. I have seen people on amazon write that his teaching in this book isnt much help but i will say that everyone is different and will have different writing styles, this is Kings point of view.<BR>The book is warm, funny and wonderfully written, its almost like Mr. King himself is sitting in your lounge room and having a chat with you and he feels like an old friend once the book is finished. He is the sort of person you wish would teach your english class.<BR>I recommend this book to any aspiring writer and even if it doesnt help you in any way it will no doubt entertain you.
B00003CXTG|3.0|My reaction after seeing the film? Well, I was totally unimpressed. While it held my attention, I never got involved with the characters and never &quot;felt&quot; for them. Even during the scenes when Pearl Harbor was being attacked, I never once felt any emotion for anybody. It reminded me very much of the old films from the 40's and 50's which depicted the bombing taking place and that was supposed to be enough. The actors were simply going through the motions here and you knew it. (Though I've never thought much of Ben Affleck as an actor anyway. I can't name anything I've seen that he's been really great in. Josh Hartnett did a much better job here in my opinion.) You knew they were just acting instead of getting attached to the characters and somehow &quot;believing in your mind&quot; that this was actually happening before you. There were some scenes which were such a direct rip-off of Titanic that I almost expected someone to shout &quot;I'm King of the World!&quot; at any moment. I never connected with the love story part of this movie either, though it worked into the plot. I just never bought the fact that anyone was really in love. Maybe there was just too much in this movie. I feel they should have concentrated on the friendship between Affleck and Hartnett (which was the only part I felt really worked and was believable) and the events at Pearl Harbor more. After the attack, you see hardly anything of the aftermath which I think would have been much more interesting than the love story part which didn't excite me at all. (The movie IS titled Pearl Harbor!!!) After all we've found out since Pearl Harbor took place, this one wasn't even historically correct. You think they'd have at least gotten that part right. So, my opinion is that it was a decent film that no one will hate, (if you get all giddy over explosions and loud noises you might really like it) but it wasn't anything to get all excited about either. Worth the cash if you have 3 hours to spendand don't know what to do with it, but hardly worth going out of your way to see.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Wainwright has presented us with that rarest of commodities these days, a good album (though the packaging is terrible.) He offers something a little different - piano-driven songs of the old tin pan alley standard variety, with a modern edge. The result is a series of incredibly tuneful numbers, with interesting arrangements, instrumentation (especially the chinese-restaurant style twangs on &quot;Greek Song&quot;), and lyrics (&quot;My new grandma, Bea Arthur&quot;). Some of these are so darn catchy they will follow you for weeks, especially &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot; and the title song, &quot;Poses.&quot; (I understand the reviewer below who didn't like his singing - like all distinctive voices, Wainwright's isn't for everyone. Try listening to a sample - either you like it or you don't.) It's rare to find this kind of thoughtful pop nowadays, and I appreciate this man's efforts to do his own thing and do it well.
0395645662|4.0|It's evident some of the reviewers are not old enough, or did not bother thinking about the plot before writing their reviews. The glaring obvious are those which, in their infinite wisdom, state that the perfect world depicted in this book is far from perfect. If you had thought about the plot, you'd realize this is the central problem of this story.<br />The story revolves around the conflict between the main character, Jonas, and his knowledge about the truth. In his community, there is no pain, war, or hate - all which we experience in our daily life. On the other hand, the population is incapable of understanding joy, love, or even colors. They are in a state of Sameness, as it is known in their society.<br />Jonas is chosen by the elders (without his opinion) to become the next Receiver. The Receiver holds all knowledge hidden from the rest of the community. They are all the memories and feelings from the past. Only the Receiver holds all the joys and sufferings, in order to maintain Sameness.<br />When Jonas is selected, the current Receiver is called The Giver. He starts to give Jonas many memories - snow, war, sunshine, pain, color. Soon enough, Jonas realizes how society lacks uniqueness. Thus, he attempts to change things.<br />The quality Lois Lowry puts in her books is excellent, but I have two problems with this particular story. (No, it's not about how the perfect world sucked.) First, it seems to be short. A year passes in just a short chapter - it would have been nice to read more about Jonas's training from The Giver. Second, the ending was not as good as the rest of the story. It is cryptic, and gives very little information as to what happened to Jonas.<br />The Giver is much, much better than the way some people make it out to be. I would recommend it to those entering high-school and above.
6300182355|4.0|I remember seeing this movie years and years ago, (I was only 3 years old when this was released in theatres back in 1980) so I rented it last night. This movies cheesy special effects and corny, comic strip dialoge give this movie a certian charm that made me want to watch it twice in one night. This movie is a result of the sci-fi, Star Wars craze of the late '70's/early 80's (that was alot better then the kung-fu craze at that time) that sadly, when widely unnoticed during its release. <br />Sam Jones is the perfect Flash Gordon and he gets flown up into space with a reporter and a scientist, who all get captured by Mings minions, (Ming is the emperor of the universe and classic bad guy.) From there he escapes, (I wont say how incase you haven't seen the movie) and gains allys from hawkmen and woodmen to fight Ming. Alot of action and alot of passion in this movie make it alot of fun to watch.
078401213X|5.0|im a self-educated 15 year old that appreciated the complex esoteric message i've recieved from this film. the best acting and directing i've ever seen. the films contains an abundence of philosophy, mathmatical enigmas, and accurate anxiety attacks. please watch and enjoy this film and try not to analyze it too much, instead try to feel it.<BR>                         <BR>                          note: best when on wacky tobaccey to help induce connection.<br />                               thank you for the best film i've ever seen darren aronofsky and sean gullette. you are truly masters as what you do.

B00005NW02|5.0|I am new to the System of a Down experience and loving every moment of it! I just bought the cd and from what I heard in the car on my way to work, IT ROCKS! Chop Suey is great and the video is a perfect accent to the song. I look forward to a live tour.
0380789019|4.0|Richard Mayhew finds his life changed after he stops to help a mysterious young woman. Through contact with her, he learns about a hidden London, the world of London Below, and he can't seem to make it back to his former life. Richard's adventures helping the young woman called Door bring him back to life, away from his steady, plodding life. I am a huge fan of Gaiman's work, and this showcases his talents, but it does have a few flaws. We aren't given enough character development, and the amount of amazing people and views and things in this story is overwhelming, and we never really have time to digest or enjoy them to the fullest. Despite this, this book is still remarkable, and it's based on a great miniseries, too. And this book features two of most stellar assassins ever seen in fiction: Croup and Vandemar. You'll never forget them!
0767903854|5.0|Mr. Bryson's wonderful sense of homor is evident on every page of this deeply researched and personal visit  to Oz. An extremely erudite writer with a supreme command of the English language, Mr. Bryson practically demands that the reader have a dictionary handy while reading any of his books. His trip to Oz highlights not only the better known cities, but also the small out-of-the-way hard-to-reach hamlets rarely visited. This is a book that has laughs on every page, and causes the reader to read pages to anyone within hearing distance. If you have been to Australia, you will have a greater affinity for Bryson's adventures, but even if you haven't been there, the book is richly entertaining. They say laughter is good for your health-reading this book will cure anything.
B00003CXDU|5.0|THis is what comedies are all about. This movie is an example of how a comedy can be really great. The cast is in top notch performance, the special effects are fantastic but not overwhelms the movie, God, everything is fantastic here. You can see clearly that all the actors,. the director, everyone involved believe in what they are doing and are havin fun doing it. Congratulations !!
B00003CXA2|3.0|Some people confuse this film as an all out sugar coated love fest but their are some hints of all out grim reaper in here! For some reason where ever Gump goes so does tragedy! From Jenny, Lieutenant Dan or Bubba to name a few they al seem to have some kind of physical or emotional problem after they meet Gump! I know a story hast to be propelled with drama but to give the central chracter all the best lines and all the best expressions to deal with the ordeals is just plain wrong! Forrest Gump leaves a little murmur in the viewers heart after its all over. But to its credit Gump is a tear jerker at its best. Zemeciks uses digital feathers and faux handicaps to paint a depressing, dark and dank world with only one bright spot and his name is Forrest &quot;Grim Reaper&quot; Gump. The film plays on every emotion from adolescence to childhood that the viewer has no choice but to root for the cinema's ultimate dim-witted hero! A good film in its own Gump-ish ways.
B0000062Y2|4.0|Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice are amazing! I have listened to this ten million times in five different recordings and I love them all! This particular recording's strong points are that it has Ted Neely, my favorite for Jesus, and Carl Anderson, my favorite for Judas. It also has &quot;Could We Start Again, Please?&quot; and &quot;Then We Are Decided&quot; which are only on the soundtrack recording. Joshua Mostel isn't the best singer as King Herod and the sound gets kind of funny during the 40 lashes though. If I were you, I would buy this soundtrack recording and the original broadway cast recording (I have both). That way you get the good parts from both. I hope you love it as much as I do!
B00004Z459|5.0|My god, I don't think I've ever liked a Cd so much.  I havn't listened to every song yet, but don't think I'll find a song I dislike.  There's a couple different styles, and with two singers, you can't get much better.  If you've read the other reviews and saw the rap/rock bit, it's not.  Metal, or a Heavier rock would fit best.  I'd highly suggest getting this cd, or get an mp3 of the following to test out; One Step Closer, Crawling, Runaway, or With you.  You'll definitly like Linkin Park.
B00005NW02|5.0|System of a Down's Toxicity is everything I expected from them - and more. This album's sound is generally tighter than that of the self-titled release. Also, there is a palpable sense of growth within the music. System has obviously been hitting their instruments, fine-tuning their unique sound. <br />The vocals are not only as frantic and hectic as before at some points, but also poignant and sweeping at others.  The lyrics on this release also seem to make a bit more sense than those of the self-titled album. The guitars are just as shattering as ever, but with more melody. Also audible on the album is a wide range of different percussion instruments. This is all indicative of System of a Down's ability and willingness to experiment to create new sounds. <br />All in all, System of a Down's Toxicity is worth every penny I paid for it.  People who liked the self-titled CD will enjoy being able to compare Toxicity to previous System of a Down works. Kudos to the band for focusing their immense creative energy into such an exciting and uplifting package.

1571200851|5.0|A very well written instruction, and project book.  Clear, concise instructions, graphics great, and the projects are varied, and not difficult.<BR>I would recommend this book to beginners, even children and teen-agers I think, who are craft minded, would love the fabric folding, and the many ways in which to use the flowers.
B00005K3NY|5.0|Scanners is a David Cronenberg classic. It has a great story about how some of the disenfranchised of society are actually telepaths cursed with actually hearing your thoughts. These Scanners also have the horrifying ability to manipulate your bodily functions from a simple nose breed to blowing out your veins to exploding your head ( One of the 2 most famous head explosions in horror - other is Maniac ). Anyway it seems that one Scanner is vying for world domination and a security corporation wants to stop him. They seemingly recruit a homeless scanner and turn him into an agent of good versus the evil scanners. The rest of the movie I won't spoil but it is a great one. The final confrontation between good vs. evil is outstanding. Although it isn't full of gore, it does have a couple of very gory scenes so it isn't for the squeamish.
B00003CXTF|5.0|I think that Pearl Harbor has a great background about the attack on Pearl Harbor, with a little bit of romantic spice between Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett. It gives the viewer an entertaining movie, while still getting that point of the attack across to the public. I would defenitely recommend this movie to anyone!
6305558167|3.0|I dont know if many people ever notice this, but when Arthur pulls the sword out of the stone for the very first time: the picture shakes slightly! I thought it was just the dvd disc itself, I exchanged it, and the same scene shakes again! It only lasts from Arthur pulls the sword out of the stone, to where he tells his father to rise, and then finds out that ahis father is not really his father! Check this out, and tell me if its not true! Two dvd discs I have seen this happen, so its gotta be Warner Bros. problem!
B000002J1H|5.0|1977 brought about the return of one of the most respected lineups in Yes history (if you think this is an amusing statement, they've had almost as many members as they've had albums).  Going For The One brought Anderson, Squire, Howe, Wakeman and White together again.<br />Going For The One achieves what no album prior to Close To The Edge was able to - a challenging yet not unpleasant foray into emotional and complex progressive rock.  Its predecessor, Relayer, while challenging, was unable to maintain much emotional punch despite the closing section of \\"The Gates of Delirium.\\" The bloated Tales from Topographic Oceans was just a little too much - the concept, the music, the length all seemed a little over the edge.  Yet Going For The One saw the band exhibiting a certain amount of restraint...for the better.<br />The album opener and title track show Yes in a musically conservative mood.  They make their point while showing a harder edge and a dense, layered sound.  With \\"Turn of the Century\\" however, the hard edge disappears and listeners are given a well crafted song based around Howe's acoustic guitars and Anderson's melodic vocals.  This song sounds huge and expansive.  \\"Parallels\\" brings Yes back to more familiar territory with a strong, upbeat progressive rock song.  \\"Wonderous Stories,\\" while being the most commercially popular song on Going For The One, is probably the least imaginative.  The lyrics are compelling but its easy to get too much of this song.  The album closes with one of the definitive Yes songs, \\"Awaken.\\"  A return to the long form, \\"Awaken\\" clocks in over 15 minutes yet delivers an emotional punch almost unequaled in the Yes catalog.<br />Overall, this is a powerful Yes album that ranks right up there with the so-called classics.
B00005NW02|5.0|Wow. It's hard for me to say this but anyone with any taste in music should enjoy this album. Essentially it invokes the same mind jarring reaction all of us had to the previous album: \\"Oh my god, I can't beleive htey are doing this. This is odd. This is crazy. IThis is ...amazing\\".<BR>Without giving too much away, Toxicity delves even farther into the range of SOAD's musical background with plenty of folk and ballad influence along with alot more hard-core jamming (ala War).<BR>I would gives tracks of note, but this album does NOT have a bad song on it. Honest. I am absolutly for the first time this year, completely satisfied with a musical \\"album\\". By album i mean 15 tracks of full body and NO filler and not ONE misplaced riff, chord, yell, scream or maniacal chortle. Listeners of this album will find this to be a more ocmpelte and well polished version of the first album while properly progrsssing into more intricate songwriting. Amazing. Simply Amazing =]
B000002J1C|5.0|If you put The Yes Album up against Fragile, you'd end up with a pretty interesting fight among Yes fans.  But to me, this album will always be THE defining Yes album.<br />When The Yes Album was released, it was seen as a major style change for the band.  Prior to The Yes Album, they had been playing slightly jazzy yet very laid back short pieces of music.  With the addition of guitarist Steve Howe, however, things began to change.  The six songs laid out on The Yes Album were to become progressive rock hallmarks.  Out of those six songs, five are still considered major Yes staples.  <br />This is perhaps the most cohesive and well-balanced album Yes has produced.  \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" reveals the true progressive genius of the band while \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" shows a Yes that isn't afraid to have fun musically.  \\"Perpetual Change\\" is a masterpiece of complex rhythms and emotional power.  The album's finest piece, however, might be \\"Starship Trooper.\\"  Through each movement of the piece, the emotional intensity increases until finally Howe's closing solo tears loose.<br />The Yes Album foreshadowed future, more progressive Yes releases.  Sure, personnel changes would decrease the stability of the band and introduce new musical elements but The Yes Album remains one of their true masterpieces.
B00000D9TK|5.0|I love this french cd by celine... it is her best work in french music... My fav tracks are ,&quot;L'abandon&quot; and ,&quot;Terre&quot; and &quot;On ne change pas&quot;!! Go out and buy this cd today... it is great! <BR>Ps, i do not speek french but i enjoy it anyways...
B000002J1F|4.0|Fragile finds Yes with what is to be considered their \\"classic\\" lineup consisting of Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Squire and Howe. However, while many feel that this is their best effort, I'd argue that The Yes Album is a more impressive effort.<BR>While Fragile contains some of the most vital tracks Yes has produced to date, it lacks cohesion. Because each member of the band was asked to contribute a solo piece, the pace of the album is uneven and the album refuses to flow.<BR>Of the five \\"solo\\" tracks, \\"The Fish\\" (a bass piece by Chris Squire) and \\"Mood For A Day\\" (a solo guitar piece by Steve Howe) are the most interesting. Wakeman's \\"Cans and Brahms\\" exhibits nothing he hadn't done before or since while Bruford's \\"Five Percent For Nothing\\" doesn't add all that much to the listening experience and sounds rather dated. Anderson's \\"We Have Heaven\\" is interesting but doesn't contribute much to the album as a whole either.<BR>The four group collaborations are very impressive and are worth the price of admission. \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" finds a more aggressive Yes while \\"South Side of the Sky\\" exhibits more experimentation. \\"Roundabout\\" and \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" became radio staples for good reason as they find Yes in top form.<BR>Fragile is excellent but because of the format, it is more a collection of songs than it is a traditional album. So, while many would argue that this is THE Yes album, I'd take The Yes Album any day but give Fragile a few spins as well.
B000002BHE|4.0|This is a awsome cd by celine but why was &quot;Your Light&quot; left out of the us version's? I love &quot;Your Light&quot; song, it is a great song i just don't understand why she would leave it out...That is why i gave this cd one star! Anyways, my favourite songs are &quot;Call The Man&quot; and &quot;Make You Happy&quot; and &quot;I Love You&quot;!!!!=)!!!! Buy this album even though it doesn't have the song &quot;Your Light&quot; it is worth it anyway's.
6301963717|5.0|This is probably one of the smartest gangster films ever. Incredibly well-shot, each set and scene is masterfully done. The double-cross plot is deftly laid out, and Tom's machinations and recoveries from set-backs is great strategy to watch.<br />Byrne's portrayal of a character of mixed-motivations and passions -loyalty and spite towards his boss, enrapturement and disgust towards the woman, steely self-control and compulsive gambling- all interplay to create a complex anti-hero. In the end you know he wins, but you are still not sure what he was fighting for or what he has gained. His weaknesses are brought out just as strongly as his strengths.<br />Although they oversimplify and caricature the mayor and the police chief, the Prohibition-era ethics and hypocrisy are masterfully portrayed. The competing mob bosses, each beset by his own romanticism and bizarre idealism along with their ruthlessness, also provide a backdrop for Tom's manipulations.<br />Simply a well-written, well-shot, well-acted, totally masterful work.
B0000029LG|3.0|Allright... So MJ is the bestselling artist in the world, but he still needs a lesson on how to make a greatest hits album. I know this wasn't quite meant as one, but seriously folks, there are too many titles missing on the first CD. When you want to make a retrospect of your carrier as a solo artist, the first thing you do is to make a list of your... Greatest Hits! Then you add some songs that have been  underrated. And some that your fans think are great. Voila... You just made a perfect Greatest Hits album. Just give the people what they want! Now, you may disagree with me, but I think this would be a great Gratest Hits Boxed Set:<br />CD 1:<br />Off The Wall<BR>Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough<BR>Rock With You<BR>She's Out Of My Life<BR>Burn This Disco Out<BR>Billie Jean<BR>Thriller<BR>Beat It<BR>The Girl is Mine<BR>Leave me Alone<BR>Smooth Criminal<br />Cd 2:<br />Dirty Diana<BR>Liberian Girl<BR>Man in the Mirror<BR>Speed Demon<BR>The Way You Make Me Feel<BR>Bad<BR>Heal The World<BR>Black Or White<BR>Gone To Soon<BR>Who Is It?<BR>Dangerous<br />Cd 3:<br />Remember The Time<BR>Jam<BR>Keep It In The Closet<BR>Earth Song<BR>History<BR>Stranger In Moscow<BR>Scream<BR>You Are Not Alone<BR>They Don't Really Care About Us<BR>Ghosts<BR>Blood On The Dance Floor<br />Then you put a nice fourth cd with some of his stuff with his brothers (ABC, I Want You Back, Can You Feel It etc.), a good bio/discografie, artwork from all the albums and a dvd of his video's. There you have it: a grand and great GREATEST HITS album boxset. Call it MICHAEL JACKSON's DELUXE GREATEST HITS BOXSET: THE REAL HISTORY and you have a sure seller!
B0000203Y5|5.0|This is an outstanding and very enjoyable documentary about a number of elderly Cuban musicians who have been brought together again after having been retired for many years. They show they indeed still have their stuff, and can still give lively performances of their music, despite being 80 or even 91 years old (in the case of the guitar player). The piano player's virtuosity was especially amazing. The movie alternates between musical scenes and interviews with the performers. Although I don't know much about Cuban music, I found this to be a engaging look at a perhaps forgotten era of Cuban music, recreated by some of its greatest performers.
B00003CXDD|5.0|...Willow struck a great blow in showing the movie-going public that the Fantasy genre wasn't just for D&amp;D geeks and computer nerds. I was happy to see Willow then, and I've been egerly awaiting it's arrival on DVD for YEARS. Willow shows that with great actors, a solid story, and a decent budget fantasy films can be successful and endearing. As opposed to the plethora of &quot;b&quot; grade fantasy movies with nobody actors and $200 budgets Willows was light-years ahead of its time (thanks Ron!).<br />Lucas, if you read these reviews, it's time you brought another classic back to life on DVD, Indiana Jones! The Laserdisks were awesome, but I know better can be done on DVD now. So please give 10s of thousands of fans some hope! Release the Indiana Jones trilogy on DVD!
B00005NW02|5.0|Easily surpassing their critically-acclaimed self-titled debut, System of a Down's &quot;Toxicity&quot; thrashes, howls, screams, growls, and bounces with a frenetic, addictive intensity, while at the same time remaining melodic and, at times, strangely beautiful and haunting.  If you're at all a fan of heavy music, this is the album to buy. <br />The limited edition features a CD-ROM.  Along with your standard extras--wallpaper and Internet links, mostly--there is a nice movie that features studio footage shot while recording the album.  Get the limited edition if you can.
B00004OCRN|5.0|Chimes is a great cd! I paid 14 dollars for this 4 song collection, but it was very very worth it! Tougher Than the Rest gains this energy I never realized it had, Be True was my anthem for a while there (and I guess it still is!), Chimes of Freedom is great as the 'new Dylan' covering Dylan, and Born to Run is like you have NEVER heard it before! <BR>Each song pertains to me in different ways, and I'm sure most people would feel the same. I highly recommend it! Bruce is always the best, and this is a fun cd to have in your collection! Don't pass it up, I guarantee you'll regret it!
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Don't waste your time with this movie, because you have seen it before. It is the same old action movie with the same old plot and...characters that are shallow and underdeveloped. The plot was so thick you couldn't cut through it with anything. It was a real disappointment!! It was too bad that with such a great premise, and an oscar winner that this movie couldn't have made more sense or been somewhat interesting. By the end of the movie I was sick of seeing Angelina Jolie waliking in slow motion, and close-ups of her lips. Laura Croft's quest for the mystical item was too easy, and made the bad guys look like they were total idiots. It's not like she is the only one that figure this stuff out. The villians were a non-issue and posed little threat to her. They can't shoot her with machine guns in wide open space? There was an imbalance between good and evil. Laura Croft would win in the end very easily just like she had all through the movie. The action sequences were hokey at times, I'm surprise they didn't just leave the green screen behind her green, because its not like we couldn't tell that's what was back there. Angelina Jolie does her best with want she has been given, and does a fair job with the five speaking lines she has in the movie. Other than that she does what she was paid to do, look sexy and wear tight fitting clothes. Over all the film had character that were strangers. You didn't know anything about them, and really you didn't care who won in the end. The hunk of plastic that is going to save or possibly destroy the world, also had no meaning. No body knew what it was suppose to do, not even the writers it sounded like. There is nothing here that is different from any other action/quest movie. Watch an Indiana Jones movie or even Alan Quartermain and you will have seen a bettter version of this movie.
B0000256VK|5.0|One of the first music videos I saw on MTV was &quot;More Than This&quot; in early 1982.  I bought the cd a few years later and I was hooked.  This would be Roxy Music's last album together.  It was a clasic.
B00004XONN|5.0|If you are stupid, do not buy this album, you will not like it.  If you lack creativity and are a complete and total bore, buy something else, this one is not for you.  If you think important music begins and ends on TRL, please, I am warning you, stay away from this album, it is a waste of your money.<br />Thank you.
B000001FMC|5.0|This album has always been my favorite.  There are a number of tracks that get my attention including the highly popular, &quot;Breakout&quot;.  &quot;Twilight World&quot; and &quot;It's Not Enough&quot; hits my interest even more.  The album is a mix of Pop, Jazz and Rock.
630027179X|5.0|Film adaptations of Malory's &quot;Le Morte Darthur&quot; have never been scarce, and several of them are indeed classics of their kind.  But ultimately, in the field of Arthurian movies, there is &quot;Excalibur,&quot; and then there is everything else. From the opening night-and-blood veiled battlefield to the closing shot of the mythic Avalon-bound barge, &quot;Excalibur&quot; is a feast for eye and soul alike.  Though no movie could ever hope to encapsulate the full scope or grandeur of Arthurian lore, &quot;Excalibur&quot; comes reasonably close, encompassing Arthur's conception, birth, rise to power, and climactic war with enchantress Morgana and illegitimate son Mordred, with many of the legend's highpoints well hit in between. Particularly powerful is director Boorman's portrayal of the Grail Quest, sobering yet inspiring.  Some raised on Disney's &quot;Sword in the Stone&quot; and T.H. White's classic books may find Boorman's vision strong meat, but in fact it is a mostly faithful adaptation of Malory supplemented by an awareness of other Athrurian writers as well. One thing in Boorman's heavy favor is that he realizes Arthur himself is indeed the central figure of these myths--not Lancelot, not Merlin, not Guinevere or Perceval.  Into this demanding role Boorman thrust little-known Nigel Terry, who meets and exceeds all expectations as the best Arthur ever on screen, a man bound by ideals he cannot fulfill but determined to see them through to the bitter end.  Helen Mirren is a glorious and elfin Morgana, and above all Nicol Williamson nearly steals the show as Merlin personified.  Half Solomon, half Loki, Williamson's Merlin is an almost unfathomable creature not of this earth, but even he consistently underestimates the inner strength of the young protege he sets on the throne. For Arthur's greatest strength is not his magical sword, but his commitment, his honor, and his faith--and while the walls of Camelot itself may crumble in the grip of Time, theseworthy things are eternal. One quarter each romance, fairy tale, Christian allegory and Shakesperean tragedy, &quot;Excalibur&quot; is nothing short of a poem written on celluloid. And, so far at least, the &quot;Le Mortre Darthur's&quot; ultimate cinematic avatar.
B000059QY2|5.0|Everything in this DVD works well: the comprimario roles (Furlanetto as Sparafucile, Vergara as Maddalena, and Barbieri as Giovanna) are very good. The major roles are also great: Pavarotti here is a good actor (perhaps because he was directed by Ponnelle), and his singing is a pleasure for my ears: his Duca is a perfect portrait of a &quot;Don Juan&quot;, althought hes a little fat for a young lover (&quot;giovane, possente e bello&quot;). Gruberova sings very well, excellent in &quot;Caro nome&quot;. But the surprise is Wixell: not a great voice like Bastianini or Warren, but what an actor! And Mr.Verdi really liked good actors, not just &quot;singing machines&quot;.<BR>Great sound and images, very nicelly staged, a very good orchestra and chorus, a excellent work from Chailly, and a sometimes controversial, but good direction from Ponnelle.<BR>Buy it.
B0000025H0|4.0|Sometimes everything just clicks into place and you know that it is as it should be. The trendy term today for this phenomenon is, I believe, \\"Feng Shui.\\" Whatever you want to call this coming together in harmony, its presence permeates this excellent recording. Carlos infuses each song with his special sound of spirits crying for enlightment---but without the excessive pyrotechnics that sometimes make his albums tiresome after repeated listenings. I agree with the other reviewers who note that the sublime keyboards of Alan Pasqua hit just the right note and that vocalist Alex Litgerwood delivers the perfect tone to these songs. My favorite song, though, is the haunting, transcendent instrumental, Aqua Marine, which will calm jagged nerves and inspire you to scrawl lines in the sand or spin a few haiku.
6303921248|5.0|Call me lame- but seriously- I have watched the miniseries several times. Ehle is a very appealing Elizabeth, and Firth- although I didn't see much to like about him at the start of the show- by the end I *loved* him. <BR>The music complements the story well, the adaptation of the story was great... This is definitely my favorite version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot;
B00003CXAA|5.0|Some of the greatest movies of all time and the greatest mafia movies of all time (only Goodfellas is even in the same league and it comes up short).  Although GIII is not as important as GI and GII it is not a betrayal and is a worthy conclusion to the story.  My main reason for reviewing, however, is to attempt to shut up the people on here whining about the release not being in &quot;saga&quot; format.....if you watch the movie in &quot;saga&quot; format you ARE NOT WATCHING THE MOVIE you are watching a modified version of the movie....these same reviewers move on to praise the additional scenes added to this version (which are actually making me consider not purchasing this release)....cut scenes are interesting but THEY ARE NOT PART OF THE MOVIE....they were intentionally left out of the movie by the director and THEY NEVER HAPPENED....if they want to make these scenes avaliable hten do what Ed Harris did with &quot;Pollock&quot; this year and include them seperately on the DVD but do not add them to the body of the movie...they arent supposed to be there!
B00005NW02|5.0|This cd is the best I have heard since the original system of a down cd. I am a huge fan of these guys and I wish tha this cd was longer. I wish it was three four days worth of system music. They have progressed ALOT since self-title. They havn't changed though. The lyrics are amazing (as usual) Serj sings them beautifully. Darron has come up with some amazing riffs. John and SHavo (though the don't garner much credit as far as song credential) are better than ever. Possible the best songs are well, all of them. The ones that stand out though are ATWA, Aerials, X, Prison Song, Chop SUey, Forest, Shimmy and Arto (it i actually a bonus a little while after Aerials. Never mind ALL the songs stand out. I know that may not be helpful but If you liked self-titled you'll die for this one. If you don't buy it I PITY YOU AND YOUR LACK OF CHOICE IN GOOD MUSIC. (sorry if offensive) BUT BUY IT NOW!!!!!!. Thank you for your time. And always remember SCience has failed our mother earth.
B000002J1S|4.0|This album was Peter Gabriel's last outing with Genesis, and represents the peak of the &quot;art-rock&quot; phase of the band.  While I personally prefer the previous album, &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;, this one is well worth listening to.  It's a &quot;concept&quot; album about a New York City street punk named Rael, who undergoes a mystical transformation and undergoes a series of (seemingly) unconnected adventures in another plane of existence.  It sorta reminds me of Alice's Wonderland, in that a person from the &quot;real&quot; world is suddenly thrust into an unfamiliar place and is the victim of a series of random-seeming, unexplainable adventures until there appears a chance to return to &quot;reality&quot;.  For those who have not listened to this album yet, I won't spoil the ending with too much detail, but let me just say that Rael finds himself with a choice - save someone who needs help in the &quot;unreal&quot; world, or take a chance on getting back home.  What he does with this choice is, to me, the heart of the album.  The album includes a lengthy set of sleeve notes, written by Peter Gabriel, that explains the action in each song, without going into much detail as to the meaning of it all.  This is definitely required reading in order to get a grasp on what's happening, since Peter Gabriel's lyrics themselves are often vague, sometimes bordering on impenetrable.  <br />Musically, the album is up to Genesis' usual standards overall, although the length of the album means that a few subpar pieces have made it in.  For me, the highlight of the entire album is Hairless Heart and Counting Out Time, but there are many other good pieces, too.  In The Cage and Carpet Crawlers are two strong tracks, and they surface on a lot of the later live albums that Genesis would release in the future.  Tony Banks' keyboards and Steve Hackett's guitars really shine!<br />This album was performed live by Genesis numerous times on their 1974-1975 tour.  Boy, I wish I could have seen that concert!  It's a shame there are no video recordings of it.  <br />Having said all this, I would give one word of warning.  As excellent as this album is, it is probably not the best intro to the Gabriel-era Genesis, especially to those who are more used to the later, Collins-era Genesis.  I speak from experience here.  As much as I like it now, it took a few listens for me to warm up to it.  If you are unfamiliar with 70's-era Genesis, I would recommend listening to &quot;Selling England By The Pound&quot; and &quot;Foxtrot&quot; first.  That's the main reason I gave this album 4 stars instead of 5, becuase it is rather inaccesible to &quot;new&quot; Genesis fans.
B0000010IS|2.0|There are two movies, one called &quot;The Fear&quot; in 1994 and one that is just &quot;Fear&quot; which starred Mark Wahlberg in 1996.  I would like the 1996 Fear soundtrack.  You have &quot;The Fear&quot; soundtrack listed under both movies. The Fear soundtrack I purchased was definitely not the music I heard in the 1996 Mark Wahlberg film.
B00005NW02|5.0|This is such a good CD! It is WAY better than their old stuff, but it's not for everyone.  If you aren't a fan of their old stuff, this CD is obviously not going to change your perspective on them.  But that's not to say that it isn't different, because it is.  All the hard riffs are harder than the first album, and the mellow, complicated \\"Daron-ized\\" riffs are even better as well.  A great example of this is \\"Deer Dance,\\" possibly the heaviest on the album.  It is has brutal, crunching riffs that show no mercy at the beginning, but then it goes into a more groove oriented bass sliding lick, with light noting by Daron.  In the middle of the song, however, it has a sweet little solo, similar to the riff from \\"Sugar\\" in that it is one note patterns, but it is much tastier.  Here is a layout:<br />Prison Song: GREAT STUFF it has some really cool time signatures at the beginning ( all heavy stuff ) and serj sings in a cool voice that almost sounds like it's from a documentary on prisons. Kewl.<br />Needles: My least fave song on the album, it just doesn't click with me.  I'm sorry, Serj, please forgive me :(<br />Deer Dance: Great heavy song, with a catchy chorus, too. It has a great 'lil semi-solo in the middle. One of the best.<br />Jet Pilot: Pretty good song, pretty heavy, but with a lighter verse. ( not too light ;) ) Man, Serj can really work his voice methinks...<br />X: Neat little song we got here starts out really slow and death black metal here, but than goes into a sugar rushed battle cry type anthem. Nice<br />Chop Suey: If you haven't heard it, too bad.  This one is great, but I don't think Sytem shud hav singles. With singles come waves of posers ( ECCH ) SOO only videos no singles ok? NEXT PLEASE!<br />Bounce: OMG this song is kewl. It short, but it is VERY catchy (I'm still singing the \\"BOUNCE JUMP UP DOWN\\" part, lol. It is a little tune about wierd things, it is just for fun though.<br />The Forest: !!! This is awesome stuff, it is amazingly moshablestuff, one of my definate faves!<br />A.T.W.A: Very good song, takes the viewpoint of charles manson methinkz... (sorry if reviews are getting shorter, but im bored)<br />Science: Good song listen on!<br />Shimmy: Good as well!<br />Version 7.0: Come on, you know if it's by sytem it's good!<br />Psycho: The one exception to my above rule, I dont like this song.<br />Aerials: VERY GOOD SONG!  It honestly could have been named \\"Spiders: Part 2\\", or something...  Different music than spiders, but ALMOST EXACT SAME LAYOUT listen and you will know!<br />Arto: Instrumental...<br />IN CONCLUSION: BEST SONGS ARE: AERIALS, and everything besides Arto, Needles, and Psycho.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|I'm just talking about the movie here (I don't own it yet), but I felt I had to say something. <br />I watched it on the recommendation of my brother, who I introduced to the world of convoluted, somewhat disturbing, interestingly ended movies about a year ago.  If he had a debt to repay in terms of movie recommendations, he has done so in full.  Thanks Bro.<br />Acting:<br />I didn't initially realize that I had seen &quot;Teddy&quot; and Natalie from the Matrix, or our protagonist Leonard, from LA Confidential.  Despite the fact that I had seen the players before, this passes my major test, which is to say that I didn't think of them AS acting during a moment of the film, nor afterwards... not until writing this review actually.  Whether you buy into the characters played is a related, but separate matter.  I did, but maybe not everyone will.  &lt;gasp... not everyone can relate to, or understand everyone else.&gt;  If you can get into the characters, you will be well rewarded for it.<br />Storytelling:<br />You all know it starts at the end and ends at the beginning, yes?  That's the basic idea, but there's also, ironically, effective use of flashback not relating to the bit of the story shown so much as to break things up even more, and provide more context for the story to develop in.  The forward rolling flashback and backward action merge at the climax quite artfully.  <br />Even without attention to these bits of craftmanship, or even much sense of cause and effect, the movie is not only watchable, but enjoyable.  Very few movies with such pretensions are actually cool BEFORE you know what's going on.<br />The overall backwards telling is, as pointed out before, not original.  It is however, in the case of this movie, more than a gimmick.  Non-comformity to timeline in telling does lend itself to abuse... all you have to do is confuse your audience and they'll have to watch the movie again... ha ha!  However, it's a step in the right direction atleast in terms of experiencing Lenny's condition and more importantly, the story works better told in reverse.<br />Again?:<br />I'm writing this after watching the movie again.  In the first viewing, quite a few iffy movies manage to entertain... a little.  Besides, I haven't been able to think about too much in between viewings.  I think I can wait another month, when it comes to film society to see it for the third time.  I think after that, I might not watch it for as long as a year or so, but I do have to see this movie again... especially with folks who've never seen it before.<br />Why not 5 stars?:<br />There pacing problems with the movie... not big ones, but noticeable in parts.  Hang in there.<br />Some people have criticized the ending as being implausable.  Here's my take on the practical end.  That a person could loose all short term memory was news to me.  I don't know the neuroscience (though I'd be curious to learn), but that a particularly traumatic short term memory might find a space in long term parking before someone in his condition could forget is unremarkable in contrast to his condition.  As for repressing memories... no credibility lost there.  <br />The bigger challenge is with the decision the character makes in the end... it's not unmotivated, and it lends a certain badassedness to the film, but it feels a touch out of character maybe.  It worked better on second viewing, but the voiced over thoughts still didn't quite bring me quite there.  If they had, this would be a five star movie for sure.
0393038912|5.0|Frankly, many books on history, biology, geography, or even evolutionary psycology, seem to skirt around the issue of why Europeans 'won', why the West dominated the world and other 'races' did not.  This books finally ties all the loose thread together, giving a whole image, if in sketch, of the ramifications of those subjects as currently understood.<br />Some of the not so favorable reviewers seem not to have read the book, or seem to be in basic disagreement with evolutionary theory or scientific theory.  Diamond is apparently well versed in history, biology, archeology and evolutionary thinking.  If not, he is a pretty good con man.  His avoidance of teleology alone makes this book several notches above other works I have seen.  &quot;Farming gives more food, so people turned to farming&quot; is not allowed here, since the proto-farmers would have no idea of how it would turn out!<br />There are some faults.  In the later chapters Diamond is not nearly as meticulous as he is in earlier sections.  His sketches become 'sketchier' and apparently more open to criticism.  However, I could find no real factual mistakes, especially in reviewing some source documents .  In some cases he does not seem to 'demonstrate' his work, only giving the premise and conclusions.  Since earlier sections were demonstrated in detail, the conclusions drawn are obvioius.  I was just somewhat disappointed that Diamond did not detail those conclusions.  These faults are trivial.<br />The display of Pacific Islander history was particularly enjoyable.  Compairing and contrasting the resulting myriad societies, and their interactions with each other and finally the 'outside' world sets the tone for the rest of the book.  The other sections, describing areas of the world, too are gems to anyone seriously interested in history.<br />If you want a clearer understanding of history, and wish not  to rely on religious or racist ideology to bolster claims of superiority, read this book.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This is my fave movie of all time!  I love the soundtrack also!
B000002KHH|5.0|This is the album to which EVERY metal band, from Iron Maiden to Cannibal Corpse, can trace its lineage.  It wasn't their first album, but it was the album that signifantly changed history.  Before Sabbath came along, the heaviest thing anyone had heard was Led Zeppelin.  Not only did Sabbath bring a sound that was heavier than anything else, it was also much darker and controversial.  With this one album, metal was officially born.  This was the first metal masterpiece.  It seems almost odd to refer to it as that today, as this album isn't on the same plane as albums like &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; or &quot;Powerslave&quot;, but you've gotta remember that there was nothing else like this 30 years ago.  This album was mindblowing for the period it is from.  But, even today, it is still evident why this album is considered a classic.  All of Sabbath's legendary tunes are here, such as &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;War Pigs&quot;, and the title track.  But there are also lesser known songs here that are very good, such as &quot;Electric Funeral&quot;, &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;, and the excellent &quot;Hand of Doom&quot;.  Tony Iommi is a very creative and talented guitarist.  He's written some of the most amazing riffs of all time.  I can't figure out how he makes such deep, sludgy sounds.  One can't help but wonder if he has some sort of custom-made guitar or something.  No one can seem to duplicate them.  Bill Ward's fast, complex drumming also stands out.  With the exception of Jon Bonham and Neil Peart (who actually came along a bit later), he was probably the best drummer of the time.  Ozzy's vocals are pretty good too.  If you're only familiar with his solo stuff, he sounded a lot different here, a lot more...normal.  Bottom line, this is a great album.  If you love metal, you need it.  The only bad thing about this album is that you can get practically every song on it somewhere else, making this album almost unnecessary.  If you don't have this album, but you have &quot;We Sold Our Soul for Rock and Roll&quot;, both &quot;NIB&quot; albums, Faith No More's &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, Megadeth's &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot;, Iced Earth's &quot;Melancholy EP&quot;, and Pantera's &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;, you're pretty much just buying this for &quot;Rat Salad&quot;.  But, if you want to hear all the songs as they originally were, you shouldn't think twice about getting this.  This was probably the best album of the 70's, outside of Boston's debut.  After this, I would also recommend getting &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, Sabbath's highly underrated album with Ronnie James Dio.  I think it's actually better than this one.  It's generally faster paced, with better solos.  And, no offense to Ozzy, and all the die-hard Ozzy fans out there, but Dio is a far superior vocalist.  But hey, this is where it all began!u have &quot;We Sold Our Soul for Rock and Roll&quot;, both &quot;NIB&quot; albums, Faith No More's &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, Megadeth's &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot;, Iced Earth's &quot;Melancholy EP&quot;, and Pantera's &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;, you're pretty much just buying this for &quot;Rat Salad&quot;.  But, if you want to hear all the songs as they originally were, you shouldn't think twice about getting this.  This was probably the best album of the 70's, outside of Boston's debut.  After this, I would also recommend getting &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, Sabbath's highly underrated album with Ronnie James Dio.  I think it's actually better than this one.  It's generally faster paced, with better solos.  And, no offense to Ozzy, and all the die-hard Ozzy fans out there, but Dio is a far superior vocalist.  But hey, this is where it all began!
B00005KHJR|5.0|The very indignant folks writing in to say the long version presented in the LE version of Anchor Bay's 'Wicker Man' is incomplete or missing scenes must be engaging in some sort of &quot;I'm cooler than you are&quot; one-upsmanship. Whatever's going on, they're mistaken. As others have pointed out, this is the longest and most complete version of the film that has been released thus far, and is virtually identical with the Magnum &quot;103 minute&quot; version (the box timing of the Magnum release is incorrect.) If complainants can provide details of scenes omitted from the Anchor Bay release that they themselves have seen in other versions (the Magnum, or any other), I'd love for them to back up their claims by posting  the information.  It must be noted, though, that even this version is apparently far from what Shaffer, Hardy, and Lee intended, as the film was mauled by the studio and the original footage is supposedly lost.  But it's the most complete one available.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|It's obvious from the get go that whoever owns the creative rights to Tomb Raider the game, had no say so in what went into the movie. I don't know everything about the game, but what I do know is that in Lara Croft's bio for the game, she was raised by a rich family, and put through finishing school. So, she IS a lady, unlike the movie makes her butch and tomboyish. Next, she was disowned and made her own fortune. So on and so forth. Angelina Jolie is a great actress, but this movie had just plain bad direction. Even great athletes need good coaches. The other performances are on par for a free-for-all cheese fest. All I can say is I hope these aren't the same people doing Resident Evil, or that they're not planning to do a Duke Nukem movie.
0553106635|5.0|What more is there to say?  If you've read the first two novels of a Song of Ice and Fire, you know just how good George R.R. Martin's writing is, and nothing I say will likely influence whether you read A Storm of Swords.  If you haven't read A Game of Thrones yet, do yourself a favor and add it to your reading list.<br />Rest assured that this novel is every bit as good as the first two.  The struggle for control of the Seven Kingdoms remains as engrossing as before.  Martin continues to shine when it comes to character: with each chapter he jumps to another member of the cast, each one strong enough to support a novel in his or her own right.<br />Jaime Lannister is a particularly welcome addition to the set of viewpoint characters.  For the first time we see the world through the eyes of the Kingslayer instead of from the vantage point of those who regard him as a monster.  Admittedly, the other new point of view character, Samwell Tarly, fails to be as interesting as any of the other characters.  He doesn't get very much to do in this novel, and I can only assume that George Martin is leading up to a bigger role for him later.<br />The only other criticism I can find about this novel is the sheer brutality of the last chapters.  It doesn't bother me that fate (the author) doesn't have a happy ending in store for everybody, but I can't help but get the feeling that George Martin saved a flurry of staggering blows for the end so as to leave the reader reeling.  It feels a little artificial.<br />But overall, A Storm of Swords solidifies A Song of Ice and Fire's claim to the title of best fantasy saga on the market.  I eagerly await the next entry and the fates of, well, to avoid too many spoilers, all the characters that survived this one.  This is the good stuff.
B00005NW02|5.0|I've been downloading songs from this CD off the Internet for weeks, but still am making plans on buying &quot;Toxicity&quot; today, it's THAT good. System of a Down is going to be HUGE. Serj Tankian with his ingenious and socially conscious lyrics and hypnotic manic vocal style is destined to become the Bono of thrash metal, just less annoying and certainly much, much more deranged. <br />SOAD mixes bits and pieces of their Armenian musical heritage into their sound to come up with music that you simply will not hear anywhere else. Dont fret headbangers- this isnt music that will be playing on National Public radio anytime soon. Armenian Folk Death Metal? Well, its a cliché, but System definitely defies classification, but your getting the idea of how unique this band really is.<br />&quot;Chop Suey!&quot; is one of the best songs I ever heard, though buyer beware: it's not a typical song on this CD. The rest of what I have heard from &quot;Toxicity&quot; is much, much harder edged. Not to say that Suey wont impair your hearing. With it's classical acoustic guitar interludes immediately devolving into thrash metal hysteria, and climaxed by an incredible chorus, &quot;Suey&quot; is one of those songs you can't get out of your head, and simply has GOT to be a bonafide radio hit.<br />&quot;Prison Song&quot;, while I've only heard the rough studio track, is another destined to be a concert anthem for this group. It's a straightforward blistering attack on the War on Drugs that is aims at it's target and completely destroys with extreme prejudice. Potheads all over will be playing this on their car CD players as loud as they can while getting pulled over by drug confiscating feds.<br />&quot;Deer Dance&quot;, which I believe is a swipe at the LAPD, is where the key to SOAD is to be found. Serj's almost chant like central Asian influenced vocals shine through on the line &quot;From the Staples Center /you can see America(?)&quot; and referring to thefuzz and their &quot;rubber bullet kisses&quot;.<br />&quot;Jet Pilot&quot; is the best example of this bands incredible composing skills. &quot;Pilot&quot; starts out like a sledgehammer, hitting you over the head wondering what the hell did you get yourself into when you bought this CD, then goes into a goofy jazz riff, then builds steam again as Serj goes into a trance once again. <br />According to a story in Rolling Stone, when one of the members of Pantera was in the studio listening to System cut this record, he described it as Crazy man's music. That's from PANTERA. System is hard to simplify, but that phrase comes the closest to doing it.<br />System of a Down has everything going for it- a great vocalist, incredible lyrics, great musicianship, inventiveness and just incredibly heavy, heavy metal. At the risk of contradicting myself, think Primus + Metallica +Crowbar + Alice in Chains- with an undeniable folk influence, insanity and Rick Rubin as your producer mixed in. It just cant get any better than this.<br />If this CD doesn't sell a million copies, then Rock IS Dead!
0399230033|5.0|While I do not have children of my own, I enjoy children's books, and this book was a delightful discovery.    I even share Good Night, Gorilla with my students (college students -- Business majors).  Each page is full of discoveries and surprises, if only you look carefully. This is a perfect gift for the children or the young-at-heart in your life.  My latest purchase is for a young boy who is being adopted from overseas; it will be a fun way to learn his new home language.  Not a lot of words on the page, but wonderful pictures that tell a delightful story.
B00003CX8I|5.0|I have always been a fan of the X-MEN; and the movie made me a bigger fan. The only disappointing points in the film were: Rogue-a teenager? and no Jubilee! Other than that, the movie was fantastic. My favorite mutant, aside from Jubliee, is Storm (played beautifully by the stunning Halle Berry) the mutant with the ability to control mother nature. My favorite scenes are the train station scene and the battle inside the Statue of Liberty. When Sabretooth thinks he has defeated Storm by grabbing her throat and slamming her against the window, she turns the tables on him and kicks his [butt]. She summons the fierce lightening and blows him back threw a concrete wall. WAY TO GO! The other scene which is almost haunting is when she is fighting Toad and he kicks her down an elevator shaft (notice how he does his Darth Maul move afterwards, hence Toad is played by Ray Park). Then all of a sudden the doors to the elevator start to shake and glow with lightening. Then the doors blow open and the STORM ARISES out of the shaft. See the movie and find out what happens.<BR>I would not have picked a better person to play Professor X than Patrick Stewart. He is an amazing actor. Another mistake was Ian McKellan playing Magneto. It looked like my grandfather was in the film. They could have expanded Cyclops and Jean Grey a little more. I have never been a fan of Wolverine, until this movie. Hugh Jackman gave his character a whole new dimension. I love Wolverine. I can't wait until the next movie. I hope we see more of Storm, Jubilee, (rumored) Gambit and Jean Grey.<BR>eXcellent movie!!!!!!!!
0380973650|5.0|Bravo, Mr. Gaiman! An epic tale that is a must for those of us who are lovers of mythical characters &amp; creatures. The common interwoven with the unreal in a convincing manner is a tribute to your writing skill. I had known of your name from your comic book work, but had never read anything of yours until now. It makes me wonder what I have missed.
B00000ILBK|1.0|I am a huge Star Trek fan who has enjoyed among many Trek films, STAR TREK II and FIRST CONTACT, but this film, INSURRECTION, is an embarrasing entry in the series. It is to the Next Generation what William Shatner's STAR TREK V was to the original cast. A lightweight, inconsequential, New Age film which has the worst elements of LOST HORIZONS and THE SOUND OF MUSIC thrown in. Add to that embarrasing humor (breast jokes, Picard doing the mambo, Worf singing 'Gilbert and Sullivan,' wart jokes etc) plus brief and shoddily edited battle space battle sequences (with Ryker using a joystick to manouver the Enterprise (!), villains in bad need of plastic surgery, and overall, hom hum special effects, with a painfully hard to watch Data subplot about him trying to understand what its like to be human, and you've got a film that makes STAR TREK GENERATIONS look like CITIZEN KANE. When will the madness end? Please someone fire Rick Berman and bring back Nick Meyer or Leonard Nimoy to salvage the Trek movie franchise. At least they knew how to frame, shoot, and edit films, utilizing the widescreen format to its limit - the original cast movies did not look like made for tv movies that were shot in Northern California, like INSURRECTION does. This travesty of a Trek film (&quot;lock and load&quot;) unsurprisingly, was the second lowest grossing Star Trek film (after ST V). It is a film even a fan can only watch once.
B00000633U|5.0|This cd has a lot of beautiful music on it. I really enjoy it. Thanks.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|My rule of thumb is, for the most part, if a movie does not do well at the box office AND there are little or no special effects, it is probably a good film.<br />This film forces you to think in reverse and reconstruct the film in your mind in a forward direction, scene by scene. The movie starts at the last scene and ends with the beginning scene.
B00005K3OT|5.0|My wife and I saw this film twice in Nashville, once in Montana, and once in Jackson MS. We have now purchased the DVD and watch it on our farm in North Mississippi. Once in a while a film comes along that moves one in a certain way, we love 'Chocolat'. The story is a bit 'Magical Realism' meets 'old fashioned' paced movies from the late 40's. It moves like a good novella, and the story is relevant.And, it is a good story. The characters are important, and no character is wasted, or 'filler'. The importance of the film from a social view is also important. Tolerance, Grace, and Mercy are words you don't usually leave a cinema thinking about. 'Chocolat' is good for you.
B0000039QA|5.0|Hip Hop fans, eager for a follow up to Biggie's magnum opus &quot;Ready To Die&quot; will not be disappointed by his follow up, which he sadly did not live to see the release of. Although, as one reviewer already mentioned, his death helped to sell the album, this album can stand on its own as one of the greatest hip hop albums ever. Almost every song on this album is ganster rap at its best. If you're looking for great beats, this is the album. If you're looking for some of the tightest lyrics in the genre, look no farther. This album has it all. <br />The best songs are: Notorious Thugs, 10 Crack Commandments, I Got A Story To Tell, Kick In The Door, I Love the Dough, and Hypnotize
B000002G60|5.0|Suzanne Vega's Nine Objects of Desire is well penned poetry put to music.  As other reviewers have stated, this is a sensual album.  It is also intelligent and spare.  There is nothing extra, nothing overdone.  A voice, a guitar and percussion.  Ocassional piano.  A lovely, heartwrenching, sexy, lonely album.  If I had favorites, I would place this near the top.
B000002J29|5.0|Recorded in Paris in 1976, this album provides an excellent overview of the band's Gabriel-era material, as well as their first two LP's with Phil Collins on vocals.<br />The recording quality is superb, and many of the solos still existed in their live show at this point (e.g. the beginnings of 'Lamb Lies Down on Broadway' and 'Firth of Fifth').<br />While the band made several albums of considerable merit after this, this CD contains their best material.  The quality of musicianship is superb, and the integrity of the studio albums the songs come from is maintained in terms of the instruments used (e.g. Tony Banks' mellotron and the organ used on the earlier albums).<br />Out of their entire catalog, this is the CD I go back to the most.  A sonic masterpiece!
B00005JIZA|5.0|It will take only a minute of listening to one of his songs before John Mayer becomes you're favorite musician. This guy exudes passion in his voice and in his guitar playing that mesmerizes the listener; leaving you wanting more after each song is over.  His melodies are fluid and each rhythm appears to take on a life of its own.  His lyrics are brutally honest, and you can tell he is sharing the deepest part of himself with his fans.  After listening to this cd you won't possible be able to pick a favorite song.  &quot;Love Song for No One&quot;, &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, &quot;Why Georgia&quot;, &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot;, each of these songs have their own identity which makes it impossible to compare or choose between then.  I cannot describe the feeling you will have from experiencing his music, I only urge you to put faith in my recommendation and of others and go ahead and buy the cd.  This will be by far, the best cd you have ever bought.
B00005NKKY|5.0|I've always thought Simon and Garfunkel were one of the most beautifully arranged groups ever to record. Their voices are angelic. Their songs are often so emotional that I can barely stand to listen to them.<br />This album, Bookends, stands at the top of my list of favorite S&amp;G recordings.<br />As the liner notes indicate, this is their fourth, &quot;and arguably best, album&quot;...&quot;a meditation on the passage of life and the psychological impact of life's irreversible, ever-accumulating losses.&quot; That's probably what sets it apart from their other recordings to me. It's ambitious, and chock-full of import and meaning. If a progressive rock band would have attempted a concept like this in the 1970s, they would have been labeled &quot;pretentious&quot; or &quot;bombastic.&quot; Yet, S&amp;G got away with it.<br />Granted, there are tracks I don't like as well as others (&quot;Save The Life Of My Child&quot; for one), but tracks such as &quot;America,&quot; &quot;Voices of Old People,&quot; &quot;Old Friends,&quot; &quot;Bookends Theme&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; more than make up for the odd track or two that doesn't strike a chord within me. &quot;Bookends Theme,&quot; alone, tugs at my heartstrings like very few songs do. And if any song seems to resonate with the spirit of the Sixties it's &quot;Mrs. Robinson.&quot;<br />There really isn't anything else I can say about this album that you probably don't already know, or haven't already read in previous reviews.<br />Except for this: The remastering is outstanding. The voices ring out clearly, the acoustic guitars are crisp and bright and there are things going on in each track that you might not have noticed in previous editions of this album.<br />While S&amp;G's previous release -- 1966's Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme -- contains many more sing-alongable songs, more that you probably know by heart, I think Bookends is their crowning achievement. If you don't yet own one of their albums, I suggest starting with this one. If this isn't available, try Parsley, Sage.<br />Oh, one more thing: If you can, listen with a good pair of headphones on to capture every nuance and note. You'll be amazed at the remastering, and captivated by the depth of their performances.
B000053V7Q|5.0|OK, it's all been said. In art there can never be perfection, only masters. The single most serious flaw in the original, being the sound, has been wonderfully corrected with a Dolby stereo re-mix that truly shines. &quot;I Just Can't Help Beleivin'&quot; (from the same take that's in the original film) was released as a single 30 years ago, so get over it that it's not in this film. This is a great remake of a flawed original film. O.K. besides all that, I just gave it 5 stars for only this: Hands down, Simply the best recording of, &quot;I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU&quot;...Ever.
B000021YQV|5.0|This album is honestly great. I am loving it. The guitars are awesome and the <BR>drumming is great and i play the drums so i know the beats to the songs. My <BR>favorite song is chop suey. I think you'll really love it. Bounce is pretty funny to.
0140186409|5.0|Beyond the Depression-era stereotypes often presumed from Steinbeck's classic are the values stemming from the Everyman nature of Tom Joad's plight.<br />What Tom Joad faced is what we face each day.<br />Joad might be seen as just an Okie looking to make it another day beyond dust and grime. Instead, once the dust blows away, we have post-Depression Oklahoma, and WWII, and today.<br />The struggle of Joad is not just his struggle in a hard time, but the same perseverence through adversity faced by Carl Sandburg's characters in his &quot;Chicago Poems,&quot; in Dicken's &quot;Bleak House&quot; and in Billy Joel's song, &quot;Allentown.&quot; Tough times are universal, no matter the environment.<br />Complex situations wrought hard decisions by Joad and his family. In these contexts, things seemed complex and heart-breaking --- and they were -- but no less are our difficulties today. Hence, Steinbeck's book is transcendent of his time and culture, and worthy of reading today.<br />Beautifully... deliciously written, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; will likely captivate you through each page.<br />I fully recommend this book.<br />Anthony Trendl
0783114222|5.0|This is an expensive boxed set, and it would be natural to wonder if a made-for-TV documentary is worth the price.<br />Don't worry, though; you'll get every penny's worth. This is nothing short of the definitive telling of the American manned space program through the Apollo program. It contains 12 hours of material, plus a disk of bonus materials.<br />The series uses a primarily dramatic retelling, rather than a factual presentation. This is used to great effect, as it better captures the spirit of the times. To get the general idea, imagine the Tom Hanks movie &quot;Apollo 13&quot; expanded to encompass the rest of the space program.<br />Some of the parts can take your breath away, as you re-live the challenges of the Apollo program and experience the awe of accomplishments that they made.

B00005NKCM|5.0|A previous reviewer warns that episodes from the first season were not aired in America as a part of the original package in the 1970s because they were considered &quot;inferior.&quot; This is extremely inaccurate.<br />Thirteen early episodes (actually pulled from both the first *and* second series) were not shown here originally because five episodes were produced in black and white, while others were considered too adult in tone for 1970s viewing in America. There is nothing inferior about these 'missing' episodes.
1881273156|5.0|People express and recieve love in different ways. Dr. Gary Chapman identifies these as the five languages of love:<br /> Quality Time* Words of Affirmation* Gifts * Acts of Service*  And Physical Touch<br /> If you express love in a way that your spouse doesn't understand, he or she won't realize you've expressed your love at all. The problem is that you're speaking 2 different love languages. <br />Perhaps your husband needs to hear encouraging words, but you feel cooking him a nice dinner will cheer him up.  When he still feels down, you're puzzled. Or, maybe your wife craves time with you-time away from the kids and television. The flowers you gave her just don't communictae that you care.<BR> <BR> This book is designed for marriage survivalists. If you have intentions of surviving out your marriage instead of living with the consequences of divorce, this is a good book.
B00005AW41|2.0|Daft Punk's second release is better than their debut, and yet it is only for fans of this kind of electronic music, or soft techno.<br />It was recommended to me because I, despite my rejection of this musical genre, fell for the other French band 'Air'. But Daft Punk is less soulful and more electronically sterile. Still, the variation in the songs is remarkably high - my compliment for that.<br />Songs like 'Veridis Quo' and 'One More Time' do possess a certain charm. But for an old rock fan like me, it is far from enough to justify a buy.
0140186395|5.0|The greatest novel which I have ever had the priveledge and delight to read. God bless John Steinbeck, or better yet, John Steinbeck bless himself for having the capacity (and choice) to choose such a frotuitous career, which yielded the most sophisticated and human epics penned by any American authors hitherto.<br />East of Eden is the finest of Steinbeck's novels, and the way that Eden and the Fall have been oriented into the story of the Trask and Hamilton families puts a whole new light on existence itself. What is man? Is man a species who is predestined by original sin to carry a guilt within them, and upon every meditation to yield that guilt into their disposition? Or is man a self-governing being who can make the choice to tear the mask of guilt off of his face and conquer his own destiny? <br />To attempt to throw you headlong into a preview/summary of the novel is not my intent in this review, but to forebode a mission into the heart of American literatures finest accomplishment.<br />This is the type of book which you close and stare at for 20 minutes upon finishing, and then procede to take a majestic walk through a park, or better yet a bad part of the neighbourhood, and brood over the lessons you have just learned about man, the universe, and the meaning of life itself.<br />In sum; read the book.<br />Thou mayest.

B000009QPO|5.0|Hollywood Town Hall was the last Jayhawks disc I bought. What was I thinking? Great harmonies and melodies, crashing and crushing guitars gave me a little bit of insight into the sometimes mystifying Sound of Lies. Sound of Lies didn't flow well from Tomorrow, but it makes more sense as a segue from Town Hall. Town Hall is a little bit closer to the Hawks roots, but establishes some of their trademarks: impeccable songwriting, soaring melodies and solid musicianship. This is one of my favorite discs.

B00005ASQ1|5.0|Whether in print or on the screen (or on the evening news for that matter), stories that aren't on the fringe of believability rarely find their way to the mass audience - &quot;Forrester&quot; is a runaway.  But not so much because of any capricious flights of fancy, but rather because of the fascinating mix of one very bright inner-city youngster who wants desperately to belong, and one churlish and equally bright, but panicky, recluse who wants desperately to be left alone - or so they both thought.<br />A marvelous tale that will probably make some English composition teachers cringe, and will reaffirm many students' suspicions that every school faculty has at least one pompous bigot begging to be dethroned.  But the story isn't some intellectual version of the never-ending marshal-arts genre.  Rather, &quot;Forrester&quot; is an enthralling story about two people separated by several generations and vastly different experiences, but symbiotically linked by their search to find out what they can accomplish with their uncommon talents, even if it requires each of them to stretch well beyond their comfort zones. <br />&quot;Forrester&quot; is about growing up - as suffered at both the dawn and sunset of adulthood.  Superb - I'm well on the way to wearing out my tape.

B0000029GA|5.0|There's something about lyricists like nas, jigga, 2pac and biggie that just blows you away everytime you listen to the way they flow on the tight beats. This is one of those clasic albums which you collect along side your 2pac, biggie, 36 chambers, doggystyle, the chronic, reasonable doubt and dark and hell's hot albums. Nas, like the artists already meantioned is a great lyricist and he shows this in this project. I enjoy every song and it is definitely an album i would recommend to any hip hop fan.
6305909326|1.0|This movie was little more than a waste of time. All that happened was he went to find the books, someone dies.  He goes to Europe and finds one book, someone dies, he finds another, someone dies, and then he finally finds out what the book does and, guess what, someone else dies.  It was just find the book, someone dies, over and over again with each one getting much more boring and more predictable.  If you ever get the chance to see this movie, DON'T!
B00004TH7Z|2.0|BRAVE NEW WORLD is not the masterpiece people are talking about. IRON MAIDEN released five great studio records: IRON MAIDEN, KILLERS, THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST, PIECE OF MIND and POWERSLAVE. After that, everything they released, however good it might be, was second-rate material. Their great merit was not to sell out to MTV standards, and this fact alone made their fan base to stay loyal even after the horrible albuns they released in the nineties. With BRAVE NEW WORLD, thing were considerably better, but the presence of Janick Gers still in the band assured that some of the weakest parts of the bad albuns are still in the band, i.e. - lousy guitar solos by Janick. And waht about a new &quot;idea&quot; discovered by the band, that of repeating choruses at least twelve times (in sucession !!) ??!!!
B00003CX5P|5.0|Ok, this review has to be done in two parts because I'd like to address both the content of the movie itself as well as the DVD release. Here we go.<br />As a longtime Star Wars fan (first movie I ever saw was &quot;Star Wars&quot; in its theatrical release in 1977 - I was 4) I deliberately avoided the hype and promotional campaigns surrounding the release of &quot;Episode I&quot; in 1999. I thought I'd be more objective if I went into the film with no expectations. Since then I've seen it once again, on video. Based on those two viewings, here's my opinion:<br />The good: Ewan McGregor as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, the political machinations of Senator Palpatine (staging a Trade Federation conflict to precipitate his rise to Chancellor of the Senate), the closing two-on-one Jedi battle (great choreography), some excellent special-effects work (the cityscapes of Coruscant and Naboo are intricately detailed), nice glimpses of familiar characters in their salad days (Artoo, Threepio, Jabba, etc) and cameos of others (note the Wookies in the Senate, as well as the species we know fondly as E.T.). There's a lot to like in this movie.<br />The bad: debunking of the mythic origins of The Force (it turns out to be a parasitic microorganism), anthropomorphic stereotypes and caricatures (specifically, the Trade Federation and the Gungans), continuity problems with the rest of the saga (Invincible battle droids and destroyer droids predate stormtroopers who fall over if you sneeze at them? Anakin built Threepio? Obi-Wan was apprenticed to Qui-Gon Jinn, not Yoda?), lack of any real character development (remember Captain Panaka? Neither do I, but he's got an action figure), and more than anything else CGI overload (at times you feel like you're watching a cartoon, especially during the Gungan battle with the droids). <br />The downright ugly: the presence of Jar-Jar Binks and the acting performance of Jake Lloyd. I know he's just a kid, but we've all seen what Haley Joel Osmentis capable of, so this kid has no excuse. <br />Overall &quot;Eisode I&quot; is a so-so movie, important primarily for its role as the &quot;stage-setter&quot; (being the first of three). It's a far cry from the triumph of &quot;the Empire Strikes Back&quot; which is the high point of the saga so far, but it's no chopped liver either.<br />That said, on to the DVD release.<br />The good: George Lucas commentary! Seven deleted scenes! Five featurettes! A one-hour &quot;making-of&quot; documentary! Multi-angle storyboards! And a music video too! This is a smorgasbord of extras for any movie buff and definately worth the price.<br />The bad and ugly: why can't the original trilogy get this treatment? I know George is busy working on &quot;Episode 2: Insert Riduculous Title Involving Clones Here&quot; but c'mon - do we really have to wait until 2010 for the &quot;Episodes IV - VI&quot; DVD releases?<br />Bottom line: this DVD should be on any Star Wars fan's list on general principle, and on any movie fan's list for the extras alone.
B0000025YL|3.0|The music fan from Irvine, CA, defined ACCEPT perfectly and in a sincere manner. This German band was always a kind of Dokken, for example: you just couldn't feel real emotion in their playing or their silly lyrics. They are a kind of worsened Scorpions. And the singer, Udo...uau !!! The guy just can't sing, it's a shame ACCEPT had Udo as their singer, since musically ACCEPT had good musicians (WOlf Hoffmann being a melodic a tenlented guitar player ). Well, but that happpened with AC/DC too, when they hired Brian Johnson.... Anyway, none of the above means RESTLESS AND WILD is a bad album. IT is not. Just forget Udo's &quot;voice&quot; and you'll discover marvellous riffing and original metal.
B00005JHAB|5.0|I loved this movie! Timless and classic, this movie is the best chick flick ever! I can't get enough of Lopez's style, and Matthew M. is a winner as well. The ending was no surprise, but it still made me cry. Great for a girl's night in!

B00003CXP1|5.0|This film is certainly not one to show your children to discourage drug use. Undoubtedly, it discourages drug use, but it is perhaps the most graphic film I have ever witnessed; certainly in the leagues of 'A Clockwork Orange' etc. I wouldn't hestiate to say that this is perhaps more graphic that the former, and again, I believe it to be more disturbing.<br />It truly will make you think twice about touching substances, with its bleak take on the world of junkies, from 'diet pills' to hard hitting heroin. There is absolutely nothing positive about this film, and that is perhaps its most effective feature.<BR>It is drug abuse at its worst; desperation to the highest degree, and it is both marvellously acted and written, with hugely innovative and clever cinematophy.<br />Certainly, one of the best films of 2000, and one that I personally won't be forgetting too soon. It has certainly altered the seeming innocence of diet pills for me!
B00000I07Q|5.0|Subtlety has never been a strong point for Bon Jovi. Whether it be the car wash girls featured in SLIPPERY WHEN WET or the demand to be considered with Bruce Springsteen on the appropriately-titled NEW JERSEY, Bon Jovi's messages and album titles hit home as strongly as their lyrics. Whatever the case, this is one time where Bon Jovi unseats the Boss and claims the title for the band that best rocks the state.<br />Without a doubt one of the greatest CDs in my collection and certainly one of the best that Bon Jovi has put out in their many years together, NEW JERSEY is truly the album of undiscovered hits. The catchy lyrics by megastar frontman Jon Bon Jovi are cemented in place with the otherworldly guitar talents of Ritchie Sambora to create the music that defined the 80s.<br />NEW JERSEY gets things rolling with \\"Lay Your Hands on Me\\" before launching the contagious \\"Bad Medicine\\" that brought post-\\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" recognition to the group. These are followed with \\"Born to be my Baby,\\" a tremendous, soul-shaking power ballad. The album dips slightly with \\"Living in Sin\\" and \\"Homebound Train,\\" both weaker tracks that are seperated by \\"Blood on Blood,\\" which flows well musically but comes off as somewhat repetitive.<br />This is, however, the setup for five of the greatest Bon Jovi songs ever, most of which have gone unheralded. Track 7, \\"Wild is the Wind,\\" is a haunting power ballad that rates as one of the best on this CD. It is followed by \\"Ride, Cowboy, Ride,\\" a short but touching prelude to \\"Stick to Your Guns.\\" This is an intense ballad that draws heavily on \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" with its Westernized cowboy theme.<br />The most beautiful song on the album is undoubtedly the tenth track, \\"I'll be There for You.\\" With the possible exception of \\"Thank You for Loving Me,\\" this is the band's most soulful, moving ballad. Even if you can't stand the other tracks on this album (for whatever reason), it is well worth the money just to have this song on hand.<br />The album closes with \\"99 in the Shade,\\" a fun song that will get your toe tapping, and \\"Love for Sale,\\" inserted as more of an outro piece than anything else and is the album's weakest link. Still, that makes three weak tracks out of twelve, and trust me the highs on this CD are very, very high. Any fan should buy this if for no other reason that to own tracks seven through eleven. If you are a new Bon Jovi fan, START WITH THIS ALBUM. You will love it.
0790731479|5.0|I buy a lot of movies a year and never get around to watching them, but Beetlejuice can be watched over and over again.  As proof, I've seen it more than five times since I bought it a year ago.  It's like Indiana Jones or Who Framed Roger Rabbit or Batman; you just HAVE to own it because it just never grows old.  So what if it's maybe not the best story ever told? Everything about it is classic.  And the scene where Beetlejuice goes to the miniature whorehouse is one of my all time favorites.
0140186409|5.0|This book brings one of the most inaccessible disasters of the 20th century, the Dust Bowl, into focus. What a mean coincidence that it had to happen when banks were going through tough times. This book, perhaps Steinbeck's best, brings the personal melodrama of Of Mice and Men on the road with a family of 14 Oklahomans. Meet the Joads, who have lived on the same land for many generations. They have killed for the land and have died for it. The bank has forclosed on the home loan, and they have been pushed out. Now they gather all they can carry with them, sell all they can't, and hit the road in a rickety car and with only about a hundred dollars and wild hopes. Grandma and Grampa are the stern, traditional voice of the family, Ma and Pa lead the family in their oddysey west, Uncle John is a booze hound with strength and grit, Noah is a strange individualist, Al is the testosterone filled young man, Tom is an ex-con who just happens to be the pragmatist and clearest thinker, Ruthie and Winfield are the wild kids, and Connie and Rose are newlyweds. I know I am forgetting someone. The book is divided into two parts: the journey to California and their heartbreaking quest to make a living. It just happens that they are members of an outcast society despised by everyone. Throughout the book they are run out of settlements, antagonized and harassed, and mistreated. A member of the oddysey is Jim Casy, a former preacher. Casy turns himself in for beating a deputy to keep Tom from getting turned in and in prison meets a man who wants to end the victimization of migrant workers. He wants to form unions. While protesting against a peach orchard (that the Joads just happen to be at) he is killed by corrupt deputies. The book is shattering in so many ways: the way the Joads are treated, how the migrants at large are treated by the cops and by the rich malevolents, and how the general people allowed themselves to be blinded by bitterness and hate. There are several deeply affecting passages: one where a bunch of oranges are dumped in a vacant area behind a Hooverville (where 'Okies' lived), then kerosene was dumped on them so that the impoverished Okies couldn't eat them; the part in which the deputies send in a starving guy to start a fight in a government camp so they can break it up (because the government camp is treating Okies like humans), one man owning a million acres and not even farming it, just owning it so he can say he owns it. These concepts of gluttony and cruelty are more than the poor migrants can take. I absolutely loved the book and think every person should read it: it shows what happens when ordinary people are hated, and how devastating and frivilous that hate can be.cting passages: one where a bunch of oranges are dumped in a vacant area behind a Hooverville (where 'Okies' lived), then kerosene was dumped on them so that the impoverished Okies couldn't eat them; the part in which the deputies send in a starving guy to start a fight in a government camp so they can break it up (because the government camp is treating Okies like humans), one man owning a million acres and not even farming it, just owning it so he can say he owns it.

B00003CXRP|3.0|I like Tom Hanks, I truly do, I think that he is a phenominal actor but this one just didn't do it for me.<BR>There is plenty of description here of what happens in the movie so I won't bore anyone with the details, just say that something seemed to be missing. The time on the island was overly long and I never really felt the characters desparation. I also felt that far more time could have been spent on his reactions as he returned to civilisation, this aspect fascinated me and wasn't touched apon at all.<BR>The three stars are really out of respect. Not the worst movie in the world by a long shot but nothing really special.
0812550706|5.0|The plot is seemingly simple: Boy Genius saves Earth. The telling of the story is what makes this book so extraordinary. The world and characters created by Card are original and believable. The Battle School, a low and null-gravity space station where students who are potential military leaders are trained, is fascinating, not only for the war game played by the students, but for the psychological interaction of the students with each other and with the teachers.<br />Ender, the hero of the book, will appeal to anybody who suffered through bullies at school. He is also a sympathetic, intelligent person upon whom a lot is laden. We follow Ender through his training and development as a leader. The ending has a neat twist, and even more wonderful, the new parallel novels Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon are worthy companion books. (There are two earlier follow-up novels, good, but not on the same theme as Ender's Game. These are Children of the Mind and Speaker for the Dead.)<br />If you like military history, war games like Age of Kings, science fiction or stories of \\"coming of age\\", you will probably enjoy Ender's Game. It is on my top 10 Sci-Fi novels list.
6305232660|5.0|I have to say that I enjoyed DEEP IMPACT a whole lot more than ARMAGEDDON, even though I loved that one, too. DEEP IMPACT, I think, is less-known because it was released like, right after ARMAGEDDON and that one was more hyped-over than DEEP IMPACT. But I think DEEP IMPACT had a better, more solid plot and more of a believable storyline with believable, talented actors. I don't say that there's anything wrong with Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, or Billy Bob Thortan (they are all great actors) but Robert DuVall, Tea Leoni, Morgan Freeman, Eljiah Wood, and Leelee Sobiski were better choices for this kind of film in some way.<br />Anyway, DEEP IMPACT is about a teen astronomer, Leo (Elijah Wood) from an astronomy club at school, who discovers that a comet, large and powerful enough to destroy the world, is heading straight for earth. There is no stopping it. And now the government must try to find a way to save the people before everything is destroyed. One thing I liked about this film that I thought was more cleaver and intelligent than in ARMAGEDDON was the fact that in DEEP IMPACT, the comet actually hit the earth and everything was destroyed. In ARMAGEDDON, they save the world in the last few seconds. And I just thought the ending twist of DEEP IMPACT was more believable and cleaver. <br />But anyway, both films are actually really good. The special effects (sound effects and visual effects) are absolutely stunning in DEEP IMPACT. This is a very original and underrated masterpiece. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes good sci-fic and action films!

B00005NW02|5.0|System of a down prove with this album why they are a true rock band. Rock is about being loud and creative and thats what Sytem do so well. System of a down have their own unique style and it rocks. Serj's vocals are prettier at points than on their self-titled debut and this really works to offset the harder music. Beautiful music. Rick Rubin scores again as producer.
B00005LKIM|3.0|I originally wathced \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" right before going to bed, and actually dreamed a sequel.  Therefore, I was anxious to see what \\"Hannibal\\" had in store.  I was disapointed.<br /><br />Although this is above average compared to much of the current films in this genre, \\"Hannibal\\" is best considered on its own merits.  It pales in comparison to the original.  In the first 20 minutes you can guess who's going to wind up dead.  (I doubt if I'm giving anything away here in saying that the roster is extensive.) There is the requisite gore, but other than one slightly squeemish dinner scene, it is pretty mild.  And suspense?  The most suspensful part was in waiting for something suspenseful to happen.
B00000IQC8|5.0|What's great about the Clerks Collector's Edition DVD is watching it scene by scene.  I did that one weekend afternoon: I'd watch a scene, then I'd go back, turn on the commentary from Kevin Smith, et al, and be entertained.  I learned several things:<br />1.  Smith originally wanted to play Randall, but decided that he couldn't be a major character and direct the film without going nuts.  Instead, he became Silent Bob.  The world hasn't been the same since.<br />2.  The idea for Mallrats came out of a guy at Sundance wanting to re-shoot Clerks as an A-movie, with color.  That's one big reason that Mallrats is just as much a &quot;buddy movie&quot; as Clerks is.<br />3.  The scenes with Randall randomly driving through town are completely incorrect--they're going nowhere near the funeral home they end up defacing later on in the movie.<br />4.  The guy who owned the funeral home really didn't expect them, and wasn't too happy with them.<br />There's plenty more, but for the insight into the world of the Jersey Trilogy, this is a good bet.
B00005NW02|5.0|I have been looking forward to this album every since hearing their new single &quot;Chop Suey&quot;, the blend of acoustic and hammering drums and guitar riffs made it an immediate catch in my head. I also had been hearing a lot of buzz concerning this album's release, which also helped to fuel my desire to purchase it as soon as possible. So when I got it I was expecting a lot out of the album. What I got was a remarkable piece of work that blew away my expectations.<br />The album starts thumping with the heavy hitting, but very odd &quot;Prison Song&quot;, in which the vocalist changes voices several times and once sounds like a nasal Fred Durst. Then comes &quot;Needles&quot; and &quot;Deer Dance&quot; which both have thundering guitars and a very fast drum beat. They also both have beautiful if not odd vocals with amusing, but poignant lyrics. &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; starts out fast then slows down slightly, then picks it up again and continues this way until the end of the song. Has beautiful vocals though, probably one of the best tracks vocally. &quot;X&quot; is a heavy song, that starts out slow, then kicks into some super-high gear, with anthemic lyrics. Good song. &quot;Chop Suey&quot; is a very good song, great mix of speedy beats and acoustic sections. A beautiful song, believe it or not. &quot;Bounce&quot; is another fast song, but seems less serious than those before it, similar to &quot;Prison Song.&quot; Decent song, one of the weaker tracks. &quot;Forest&quot; does not have the punk beat, the earlier songs have, but is still a good song. Great vocals and lyrics, sounds similar to Tool. &quot;ATWA&quot; starts extremely slow, but kicks in during the &quot;I don't feel it anymore&quot;, and repeats the cycle. Another excellent song vocally and lyrically. &quot;Science&quot; is a cool song that slows down in the middle, then the hammering guitars and drums kick back in with Serj's anthemic vocals. The lyrics seem to convey that he believes religion over science. &quot;Shimmy&quot; is another odd song similar to &quot;Prison Song&quot; and &quot;Bounce&quot;, better than the latter. Cool lyrics make this a memorable song. &quot;Toxicity&quot; is a poignant song with powerful lyrics and pounding guitars. &quot;Psycho&quot; is melodic song that talks about cocaine adicts. One of the best tracks on the album. &quot;Aerials&quot; is a harmonious blend of stunning vocals and moving guitar work. The best song on the album, incredible lyrics, great way to end this brilliant album. After the song there is some odd tribal music, not really worth the time to listen to, though. <br />As a band the musicians are top-notch creating beautiful metal riffs and punk beats. The lyrics are affecting and have great meanings, while Serj Tankian sings, rants, and screams beautifully his passions. These guys are similar in message to Rage Against the Machine, but have their own distinct style. Beautifully done, recommended for fans of Staind, Tool, Godsmack, etc.
B000001GQB|4.0|Bohm's interpretations of Mozart's great symphonies, to quote the Penquin Guide &quot;have the air of inevitability.&quot; Bohm may be the most perfect metronome that ever led an orchestra, but when it comes to Mozart a little flexiblity of tempo (rubato) can reveal more subtleties in the music. There is no question of the existence of power in Mozart's last symphonies and Bohm is no slacker here. There are however lighter moments throughout these works, and this is where Karajan, Britten, and even Szell surpass Bohm. A dedicated Mozart devotee will find kernels of delight and many revelations in all of these great conductor's recordings of these brilliant works, and will eventually come to own sets from several conductors. A person seeking to just fill out his collection of the basic repertoire may be better served (and even save a few dollars) with the Karajan set, but that is not to say this wouldn't be a good representative collection. If perfect tempo and full sound fill your cup of tea, this set will do you fine. If the lightness of the Mozart line, and the sweet humor of his genius are more to your taste I would recommend the Karajan set. If you like your hair to stand up on the back of your neck, Szell is then the engine to drive the orchestra to frenzied perfection. If you like a gentler Mozartian spring breeze, Britten's set will mist your eyes with delight. If you love Mozart with all your heart and soul, buy them all. I did.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I think it is interesting to read reviews of books and CDs that I have read and listened to. I was totally amazed that so many people were criticizing Creed. I have heard all the groups in the past 10-15 years that are considered Alternative or Grunge or just plain Rock. Some good, some bad. Creed is the best I've heard in a long, long time. Yes, Scott sound a lot like Eddie Vetter, so what! Maybe that part of the initial appeal, but anybody who listens further will realize that this band is just not another knock-off of what has been done and re-done over and over in the past 10 years. These songs really rock, but they have wonderful meaning also. This group has been through a lot individually and as a band and it shows in the maturity of the lyrics. How can a song that you've heard over and over and over still give you chills when you listen to it??? A great song that touches your heart or soul will do that every time, and there are several songs on this CD like that. I can honestly say that this is one of the best CDs I've ever listened to.
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down's Toxicity is an instant classic. By far the best metal band out there. No can sing like Serj,and their distinct sound is great. Toxicity doesn't sound the same as their self-titled album, but they don't stray too far from the sound that makes them unique. With less screaming,and more singing Serj proves his vocal talents have grown since the 1998 debute. The single Chop Suey! being one of the best songs on the album,only helped the urge to get this the second it came out.Some of the songs are alittle on the short side,but they still kick a**, they don't have all of those un-neccasary solo's. The shorter the song,the faster and harder it is. Like Shimmy,Bounce,Jet Pilot,and X. My only realy complaint is the amount of tracks left off. Like Johnny, F**k the System,Innervison,K.I.T.T.,and Chick N Stew. Songs that for no apparent (well not apparent to me) reason where left off an' otherwise classic album.
B00005221M|4.0|Picture yourself in the year 1992: three years before Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' and 'Scarlet Letter', and two years before Daniel Day-Lewis jumped to world fame with his brilliant Oscar-winning performance in 'My Left Foot'. What we're talking about is 'The Last of the Mohicans,' the first of the 90s such epic movies, brilliantly directed by Michael Mann.<br />If you're used to his more recent works, such as 'Heat' (with Pacino and De Niro), or 'The Insider' (Pacino/Rusell Crowe), you'd find this one very different. It's about a different time, a time of war between the English and the French for control over the American colonies; and it's about a love story that goes on between Hawkeye (the adopted son of Mohican Chingachgook, played by Daniel Day-Lewis) and Madeleine Stowe, who plays the role of Cora, one of the courageous daughters of a British general.<br />Ironically enough, given that the movie would make out of Day-Lewis a super-star, this has not been his most brilliant performance, although he's impressing with his ability to be running all through the movie, and with the ease with which he switches from English to Mohican and back. The best performance, it has to be said, was Wes Studi's. He played Magua, a Huron filled with hatred toward the English and their allies.<br />As for the photography and the score, impeccable and largely responsible for serving as a very good frame to the epic story. The audio of the DVD, though, had some issues such as important differences between the intensity of the dialog and the sound effects, which made the viewing a bit annoying at times such as battle scenes.
B00003CXA2|1.0|If you fall in line, follow orders, and follow the rules of society no matter what your mental limitations are, you will be successful (to a certain extent). If you think, question authority, question reality, question society, and live for yourself; you are irresponsible and will fall down a spiral and die of a terrible debilitating disease.<BR>That is either a sad message to send to the world, or the writers of the film are making sardonically poetic commentary (but I really don't give them that much credit). Are Baby Boomers done patting themselves on the back yet?
B00005A3KS|5.0|Kathryn Bigelow's &quot;Point Break&quot; is quite frankly one of the greatest films ever made mainly because what it's not; serious.<BR>This is not a serious film...not in the least, but it is entertaining...which was exactly what the filmmakers intended. As with all action films, there are basic plot elements, and characters that are sometimes thin, but what &quot;Point Break&quot; contains are characters that know exactly what kind of situation they are in, thus making them believable. Patrick Swayze is especially memorable as the zen surf master, Bohdi, who believes that life is a thrill ride designed by gods. The plot is perhaps stretching it a bit (how to stop surfers that rob banks), but the film itself, taking into account the technical aspects of it, is brilliant. Executive Produced and written (uncredited) by James Cameron, Bigelow's film towers above most others in areas of energy,and in surf and aerial cinematography. The film's surf and sky-diving sequences will take your breath away. Other high- lights include virtuoso steadi-cam movement in a memorable foot-chase through a suburban neighborhood. &quot;Point Break&quot; is a film that knew it wasn't going to make AFI's 100 best films ever made...it knew that it wasn't going to change the world in any way...and it knew that it's existance was only to entertain. Because of that, it becomes a film that is astonishing in it's sheer amount of energy, and an example in action filmmaking.

All in all a great cd and definatly worth the buy.
B00003CY3W|5.0|This adaptation of a comic by the same name follows two unconventional teens as they graduate high school and embark on an adult life.  The friendship between Rebecca and Enid (the latter played to perfection by Thora Birch) changes as Rebecca gets a job and Enid doesn't.  <br />We follow Enid as she sketches strangers in diners, follows people around, and becomes strangely drawn to one misfit whom she plays a prank on, pities, and then admires.  The middle-aged misfit she befriends, Seymour (with a really wonderful performance by Steve Buscemi), collects old 78's and can talk your ear off about the blues.  Their complicated, lonely relationship is beautifully written and acted with its unstable mix of friendship, mutual affection, and confused sexual tension.  <br />Here is a really truthful coming-of-age movie about ordinary people.  People with blemishes and obsessions, who bear no resemblance to the humanoid creatures we see in most Hollywood pictures!  Ordinary folks dwelling in an urban world of commercial banalities and packaged foods.  It is such a relief, and this is such a witty, smart, sensitive film with a sweet side that is NOT sentimental or phoney.
B00005ASOC|5.0|The fact that 'Finding Forrester' somewhat brings 'Good Will Hunting' to mind is not such a big coincidence, considering that Gus Van Sant was the director of both, with a very weird and unsuccessful project (the movie 'Psycho') in the middle. But Van Sant was careful enough to maintain things at a resemblance level, only picking up the best elements from his own masterpiece (in fact, more like the masterpiece of Matt Damon -who happens to play the minor role of a lawyer in this movie- and Ben Affleck, authors of the script). The script for 'Finding Forrester' instead puts out there the name of an amateur script writer and not-so-amateur News Director from Oregon: Mike Rich.<br />The movie is centered in the Bronx, where a gifted high school student and neighborhood basketball star Jamal Wallace (played by young talent Rob Brown) begins an interesting friendship with a former literary star turned hermit, William Forrester (played by Sean Connery). The relationship between the very mature sixteen-year-old and the seventy-plus-year-old author evolves as Wallace earns the respect and trust of Forrester, as a result of the his brightness and candor, in the midst of a most adverse environment.<br />As Wallace experiences the chance of a lifetime in the form of a scholarship to one of the most prestigious private high schools, he is faced with a human feeling he was not as used to in his poor Bronx: envy. The envy of another just-as-talented basketball player, and that of his bitter and not-so-brilliant literature teacher, Robert Crawford, notably played by F. Murray Abraham. Abraham is an actor that has already performed roles of this sort, such as Antonio Salieri in 'Amadeus' so you can guess that he does this extremely well.<br />Connery's performance, as usual, was flawless, and so was Brown's. All these performances along with the script, one which deserves the highest praise, make very upsetting the fact that the movie went so unnoticed when it was playing in Theaters. This movie stands up there with 'Dead Poets Society' and 'Good Will Hunting', among the movies of its kind.rs.

B00003CX9E|2.0|I watch movies on the surface as they were and are intended. If I want to look deeply into something I read a book. This movie is moderately entertaining though.  You do need some intelligence and patience to watch it, as it does drag on in parts of the movie. I think what this movie needed was some twist at the end. Don't we feel ultimately cheated at the conclusion, when we discover that rosebud was a sled?  Who cares?  Maybe I missed some deep rooted meaning to the big mystery that is rosebud.  Sorry!  Anyone who saw this film without preconceived notions as I did, wouldn't say, &quot;Oh my God its the sled, rosebud is the sled&quot;.  They would groan and say as I did; &quot;oh...It's the sled&quot;.  Once is enough, It's not a movie I could watch again and again as I can with a Hitchcock film.
630575067X|2.0|I'm suprised at this movie. I was realy cheesed off. I thought this would be some great scifi drama like the last 3. You could call this a kids movie practicly. In the movie the good guys will only nuetrilise threats if they our non living. Naboo all they talk about is we must realy on negotioations. Even when the power is out. There was no siege at all they didn't even go down figting on there own. It reminds reminds me of the halacust. They dont't even pick up a laser until the Jedis come.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I have never been much of a Blur fan, though some of their songs did strike a chord somewhere. However, Blur frontman, Damon Albam who fronts this 3D virtual band, did invoke my interest. The novelty lies in the fact that Gorillaz is a virtual band, you wont see them in person in videos, no live concerts...just music. Bu then no just your plain old rock music. In fact, the album shines beyond the novelty.<br /><br />The songs on this album is much more diverse than Blur's own. A concotion of pop, rock, and even hiphop, all nicely rolled into a package. Blur fans may shun this as Damon opts for a visibly more comercial path, but then it's still way better than your run-of-the-mill teen pop. Where Blur has previously failed to penetrate in the USA, Damon does it with Gorilaz. The album is #16 and gold in the US.<br /><br />Excellent tracks include Clint Eastwood, Today Comes Tomorrow, and the big smash 19/2000. Lacking here is the upbeat remix of 19/2000 (soulchild). But you'll be able to find the remix of Clint Eastwood (Ed Case) as a hidden track after Track 17. Included on this version are two bonus tracks and an enhanced track. Check out their string of animated videos, funny! Worth parting your $ for!
B00005KHJM|5.0|I too was pretty horrified to see that this was a 99 minute version and not the '102 minute' Magnum version that I have on tape. However, I did find the reason for this curious discrepancy that enraged some of the reviewers. It has to do with the fact that Magnum included the blank lead time and the &quot;Rated R&quot; bit in their timing of the movie. If you start the Magnum tape right at the bit where the British Lion logo comes up, you'll see that the real running time of the Magnum version is 99 minutes.<br />My only real complaint is that I didn't see any need to package the cut version. Why not just make the second DVD full of extras such as the soundtrack?
B00003CXC7|4.0|Great dialogue, Stewart as the chair-bound reporter observing life as it occurs outside his &quot;rear window&quot;, in the alley below and also through the windows of the opposing apartment complex....does he observe a murder?  We do not know, and neither does he, it does make for great suspense, kelly is fun as his girlfriend, too!
630575067X|2.0|I'm suprised at this movie. I was realy cheesed off. I thought this would be some great scifi drama like the last 3. You could call this a kids movie practicly. In the movie the good guys will only nuetrilise threats if they our non living. Naboo all they talk about is we must realy on negotioations. Even when the power is out. There was no siege at all they didn't even go down figting on there own. It reminds reminds me of the halacust. They dont't even pick up a laser until the Jedis come.
6300216365|4.0|As I'm sure you now by now, this film stars Woody Allen as a film critic and CASABLANCA buff (coincidentally named Allen) whose bored wife leaves him in the throes of insecure bachelorhood, while he secretly yearns to fulfill Humphrey Bogart's role in his own love life.  Watching Woody at his neurotic, self-deprecating best is fun, and he does a lot of physical comedy in this entertaining little film.  It's funny that this is an essential Woody Allen film, yet Woody Allen himself didn't direct it!  The film's director is Herbert Ross, director of some clever &amp; funny movies such as MY BLUE HEAVEN (1991), and some not-so-clever-and-funny movies, most notably the awful PENNIES FROM HEAVEN (1981).  However, Woody wrote the screenplay, which had been adapted from the stage play that he also had written.  Since Herbert Ross doesn't take any liberties with Woody's style, it ends up being by all accounts a classic Woody Allen film.<br />Co-starring in this enjoyable film are Diane Keaton (in her first of many films with the irreppressable Allen), Tony Roberts (as Keaton's too-busy and full-of-himself husband), and Jerry Lacy (who continually appears to Woody as a vision of Mr. Bogart).  This film was originally set in New York City, but ended up getting re-set to San Francisco due to a labor strike.  Of course, all of the actors in this movie have New York accents, but that's no matter.  PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM is so much fun to see for all of the trouble that Woody gets into with his dates that we only care for how his character will redeem himself by film's end.<br />Classic Woody!!!

B00003CX5P|2.0|Well, after only 1,800+ reviews, I figured I would add my two cents worth.  Enough about Jar Jar, we all hated him, end of story.  The real problem with this movie is that Lucas has forgotten what gives a movie value and entrances the watcher.  There simply was nothing to pull you in, to make you feel like you are watching some great epic struggle.  This is what the first two movies had (and somewhat the third movie).  Nobody cares about CGI generated tadpoles fighting CGI generated robots!  &quot;Gee wiz the special effects are great, but do I really care what happens to either side being depicted?&quot;  Um, no.  Please, Mr. Lucas, go back and watch the first two movies of your own series and try to recreate the magic.<br />Now, as for whether you should purchase this DVD or not?  Yes, but skip to the Jedi lightsaber battle scenes.  This is the best thing about a DVD--it's way easier to do this than with tape!
6302814359|1.0|You may have seen the first Return of the Living Dead and you probably enjoyed it.Most horror fans enjoy the first one,I know I did.I did not see this movie until recently.It came on the Sci Fi Channel and I was happy because I loved part one and thought I would be seeing something as cool.I was very wrong!This is a zombie movie for twelve year olds.The first one was great it had humour but a dark and morbid humour yet it was also really scary in some parts.In short it managed to make twisted people laugh but was still true horror.Now part two was basically the stupidest slapstick comedy you have ever seen.In part one the zombies were scary because they were intelligent and hard to destroy and could run.The scene in part one when they rose from the grave was very scary because of the atmosphere and the fog and because it seemed like to be a large graveyard and the characters were surrounded by zombies with almost no chance of escape.Now in part two when the zombies rise it is a joke.You see an elderly woman zombie looking for her glasses,you see one zombie stepping on anothers hand.Things only kids would find amusing.The ideal of the dead rising is scary and it should not be made into a joke.I do not watch horror to laugh.If I wanted to see the type of things you see in Return of the Living Dead part two I would watch Abott and Costello or something,I mean this movie has more in common with Abott and Costello than it does with the first Return of the Living Dead or any horror movie for that matter.Return of the Living Dead part two belongs in the comedy section of the video store not the horror section.The sad thing is it fails to even do comedy right.It is just pure stupidity no matter what category it is called.Kids that liked that GooseBumps show that was on Saturday mornings at one time or the GooseBumps books may enjoy this.However if you really want horror avoid this worthless and truly idiotic movie.
0871137380|5.0|I recall hearing very little about this event when it happened, but I will never forget the video of our brave KIA's being dragged through the filty streets of Mogadishu by the very same people we were there to help.  The fact that the media glossed this over is a shame, and is a smack in the face of every soldier who puts their lives on the line for this country every day.  Many thanks to Mark Bowden for reminding us of their sacrifice, and for doing what the media should have done 8 years ago.  Finally, many, many thanks to the soldiers who remind us of how lucky we are to be Americans, based on their hard work defending our way of life.<BR>NSDQ!!
B00004NRWH|5.0|Canada has some absolutely killer music. Finger eleven, Econoline Crush, and of course Nickelback. This cd is quite original. I only wished that the guitarist would display more of his skill like he does on track #6 Diggin This. This song is definately worth however much you pay for it(considering that if you pay over $... for a cd your getting royaly ...). Anyways, good ... cd. Definatly worth the greenbacks. Check out the up and coming \\"Silver Side Up\\". I'm sure it'll rock.
B000021YQV|4.0|This album is a rarity these days--a pop album that doesn't try to be anything more than a lot of fun.  Certainly one of the better freshman entries from a top-40's style band in the last few years.  All the songs are fun, and although the lyrics are sometimes silly, they don't detract from the overall song itself.  The production on this album, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  The music often bleeds into itself and becomes mushy.  But I have no doubt this mildly popular Los Angeles band will take care of that on their next album, and will go on to become extremely successful.
B00004Z400|5.0|I know that alot of you think or would think that it isn't as good as Around the Fur. To me really, it doesnt really matter, you either like the album or you dont. This album is really suprising when you realize they are trying something new, and to tell you the truth, its not that bad. Alot of songs (including back to school, rx queen, digital bath, and elite) are well written and well played. The Deftones have done a great change and are still one of my favorite bands. This album is worth to purchase if you are a big metal fan or a big deftones fan. If you dont get it, your missing out.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|Featuring a number of their most insipid songs (\\"Love Me Do\\", \\"All You Need Is Love\\", and above all \\"Yellow Submarine\\"), this completely unnecessary album is a tribute to the greed of the surviving Beatles and those around them.  Enjoy your royalty checks, Yoko.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is the best, I mean , all of the songs are good,and I never get tired of listening to this album, no band can compare with Nirvana.<BR>-Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) wishes Kurt Cobain was &quot;alive&quot;!!!-<BR>+RcD-
0385335482|4.0|I think you've met your match! In the tradition of &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; ms Kinsella has created another almost smart, british airhead who finds herself in crazy, improbable situations. Also like Bridget Jones, you can't help but like the story, as she looses all her money and credit, and has to work her way back to financial security. All the while her hair, clothes, and love life are much more important. At least she finds a financially stable man who seems to really care for her. This was a quick, cutesy read that I enjoyed despite myself.
B00005JCAA|5.0|Don't be put off by the 3 hour running time. The performances and direction, the delicately-told story need the time and make full use of it.
6305627347|4.0|First of all let me say that while I enjoy South Park the series, when I get a chance to see it, I fully admit to having been completely disgusted or just plain offended by it more than once.  But the movie is a different story.  Definitely not for children and DEFINITELY not for those lacking a sense of humor but one of the funniest ever.  Those songs crack me up &quot;you should never say f***, you should never say f***, F*** NO!&quot;, the mockery of every sappy Disney movie ever made, etc.  Hysterical.  And let us not forget the introduction of... THE MOLE.  I've seen this movie over and over... and laugh through it every time.
B000053VAF|5.0|With Dogma Kevin Smith shows an excellent blend of comedy, controversy, and profound thought on the concept of religion. Many people will tend to latch onto one of those three things upon first watching this movie, but I think the most enjoyment comes from watching how those things play off of each other to drive this movie.
0140177396|5.0|Most people have read this book already - most likely because they had to in school.  No one likes doing things they have to do, so you may not have fond memories of this book.  But read it again - it's worth it.
B000059POY|4.0|You can read any of the other reviews and get the idea.  This film puts together vignettes featuring a panoply of famous actors (Brando, Coburn, Burton, Matthau, et al.)and not-so-master-thespians (Sugar Ray Robinson, Ringo Starr, et al.)  It is fun.  Ewa Aulin is nice looking and generates the one or two emotions required for the role.  The film is entertaining more for seeing the cast do so well in silly situations than for serving any plot or theme.<br />The soundtrack is special.  Dave Grusin is mostly known as a jazz composer and musician.  His soundtrack has the simplicity of the rock sounds of the late sixties blended with jazz elements.  The result is one of the best collections of music I have ever heard.  In addition, there is &quot;Child of the Universe&quot; performed by the Byrds, co-written by Grusin, and &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot; by Steppenwolf.  My old vinyl disk has seen better days and I am not aware of this soundtrack ever making it to CD.  Darn!<br />The combination of the various elements of &quot;Candy&quot; results in a movie I recommend viewing.  I have the DVD and will view this every once in awhile for the fun and the music.
6304578458|2.0|Am I the ONLY one who found this movie to be &quot;Grosse&quot;-ly overrated?  And I am a huge, huge, HUGE Cusack fan.  I really can't say I was impressed (the fact that Minnie Driver was in it didn't help matters any)nor did I find it to be overly funny. Definitely not Cusack's best.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The soundtrack really sets the tone for this well paced journey.  Not too fast, not too slow, the Coen brothers show us depression era America and some of it's famous faces.  All loosely tied together after Homer's Odyssey, O Brother has enough substance to keep my attention,  without demanding it.  The quirky characters and situations keep the pace up and lead you through this amusing story.

B00004Z459|1.0|This band and Adema sound like a hardcore Backstreet Boys conversion, thus the birth of the horrid new genre N'Sync-Core.  This band is mainly popular with the same crowd that just graduated primary school, as anyone that has been into hard music before that time would see the sickness of this type of sound.  No band should ever have a singer...takes no talent..this band has 2 and 98 degrees has 4, like I said about half Boy Band and half &quot;x-treme.&quot;  Anyone that has been playing this type of music for anywhere over 2 or 3 years I'm sure is disappointed that nu-hardcore is mutating into Boy Band with guitars.
0780625129|5.0|The Genre of a movie is often extracted by certain characteristics that we associate with specific aspects in that movie. Why are we drawn to view certain genres of movies? We may be looking for a specific genre of movie because of something that is going on in our own lives at any given time. Drama is one of the most widely viewed and created genres in the film business. This could be because drama centers around conflict of characters and our lives are consistently revolving around conflict of sometime. If it is not directly in our lives it plays a part in someones life who is close to us. Though movies are characterized as a drama, western, horror film, or one of many others, this does not mean that the film will solely roll along the tracks set forth by that genre. American History X is one of few movies that may be classified as a drama, but it will also give you a whole new perspective on how you view what is going on around you, and may even lead you to question areas of your life.<BR>American History X does show many things that you would expect to see in a drama film. Camera shots that start us viewing the normal state of a character and then changing pace as he is plummeting in a downward spiral through life. We see this in Derek Vinyards (Edward Norton) case as we see him in his house, (though already we can tell something is wrong by the way he is living) and shortly after we see him murder someone. Drama, as defined by Webster, is: A prose or verse composition presenting in dialogue and action a story involving conflict or contrast of characters, intended to be performed on the stage. Conflict plays a significant role in American History X. We see conflict between Derek Vinyard and his brother Danny (Edward Furlong), we see conflict between the Vinyard boys and their mother, we see conflict between just about every character that has a prominent role in this film. Most of all, we have conflict between black and white, which American HistoryX is centered around. We live through the drama of Derek Vinyards life and see his perspective and why he views things the way he does. We are so immersed in the drama that we begin to ask ourselves questions about how we are living. We watch Vinyard as he turns himself around and how he tries to undo what he has done in his life. We feel the struggles of his dramatic path through life, and we begin to ask ourselves the same questions he faces. The conflict surrounding Derek is so strong that it is impossible to ignore. It is very easy to see how this movie is classified by a drama, but American History X is definitely not just another drama. American History X is film so dramatic, so controversial, with so much conflict, that it will leave you sitting in silence while the credits roll. American History X will have you questioning yourself and your life, all because of a movie some people say is probably just another drama.<br />written for: CST 4395
B00004Z459|5.0|After hearing of the break up of one of my favorite bands, rage against the machine, last in the fall of 2000, I didn't think that there would be another band that would fuse rap and metal that well or that intesley ever again. It seems like the other acts lacked the intensity or style that rage did. Then, a few months later, I hear Linkin Park's One Step Closer. For the life of me, I couldn't get the song out of my head. The band was talented, fast, angry and forceful. After listening through their album, I was suprised that there could be another group of positions that could combine rap and metal in a really interesting way that I hadn't heard before. What makes the album interesting is that it has two lead singers who play off each other. In addition, Linkin Park bring has more of the  instrumental side of rap present style present with the help of turntable and synthisizers.<br />Hopefully this band will go on to great things.

I remember my parents letting me and my school friends watch The Warriors in the early 80's, and then we all went to school the next day with WARRIORS scrawled on the back of our jackets, shirts, t-shirts, anything.....<BR>Must have seen the video loads of times and one day it was on British TV and I was startled to see a different beginning, and a few different camera angles throughout.  So Ive got two versions on tape, and the DVD.<BR>This film is an absolute classic and the DVD, although not spectacular, helps blast the gangs identity through the NY darkness.  Managed to visit NY last year and had my photo taken next to the Wonder Wheel, Union Square, and of course home sweet home - Stillwell Avenue.<BR>Still watch this almost every week, theres nothing better.<BR>You guys are good...real good..........we're the best
B00004XMS0|4.0|BATMAN.......this movie was a classic, the original Batman, we've got Michael Keaton as the alleged Masked hero, and outstanding performance by Jack Nicholson playing the one and only Joker, of corse we've got outstanding makers of this film, Tim Burton's first time directing which was extrordinary, he really put the right image of the Dark comic book version of Batman in Gotham City, and let us not forget the beautifle masterpiece of Batman's theme and the score by Danny Elfman in which he won an oscar for. Batman Returns,a very most darker tone, the same people,includinge new stars; Michelle Pheiffer and Danny Devito as the sick and twisted Penguin, this movie had some insite with its story of Batman, Catwoman and, Penguin. Batman Forever.......this movie was a completly different point of view of the Dark Batman Knight, with Zanny Jim Carrey as the Insane Riddler [aside from the possible oneliners to be said, it was a great role] and of corse the great Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, but this wasn't Batman, Keatonless, Burtonless, Elfmanless, the greats that made the first 2 landmarks, yet the director did capture the cartoonish Batman comic style introducing Robin. As for Batman &amp; Robin, whew! nice cast and all but, these guys are flying through the air,swinging from strings, Mr.Freeze is frozen not Mr.super human strength, Poisun Ivy.....just think Uma Thurman, it was a nice role, too many pointless oneliners, interfacing with God only to put a dramatic realization to the un real, un dark, un batman story and not only that they dragged it on for 2 hours or so, the only thing worth the price of admission is the cast and the &quot;action&quot;. Aside from the 4th, the first 2 are absolutly incredible movies the 3rd is entertaining and watchable and.......worth the price.
0876852630|1.0|I bought this book based on the reviews I had read.  The story is incredibly tedious, repetitive, tedious and repetitive.  Bukowski's writes well but the book lacks any direction.  I do not recommend this book at all.
B00003CXAR|5.0|A Number One Classic! Everything about this movie is perfect, 1975!  This movie became a legend of its time, this movie scared the heck out thousands of people because it was perfect, it was a perfectly made horror film, even if you arent scared to swim at the beach or go in the water,if you see this movieit will forever give some intellect that something below you could grab you with enormous sharp teeth, even if it does'nt ....its still down there and it can kill, and your swimming above, hows that for a scary idea, well thats what brilliant upon brilliant Peter Benchly created up there in his old noggin of a brain that sared the heck out of thousands of people across America.  Bringing Steven Spieldberg to this review is wise, after finishing Duel, he came to this after reading the novel by Peter Benchly, they decide to make the movie, Peter Benchly with the screenplay, Robert Shaw makes the part on the spot, Richard Dreyfuss who implied to have the part of Hooper that was originally given to someone else, got the part, and after thinking about it Roy Shcieder took the part of the Sea struck Rode Island Police Chief.  These guys were remarkable in this film, they were too real asuming the coincidence of this happenening never, they were also extremly funny especially Drefuss and Shaw's little quarries....&quot;Hooper!&quot; it just cracks me up, and above all John Williams terrifying score, the movie would have only been half as scary without the music, in which became one of many memorable symbols to the movie, 4 stars from Leonard Maltin, srtictly by book speaking I agree 110%, yet out of boundaries I give this one 5 stars.
B000000HTM|5.0|I rediscovered this ancient classic during a clear out of the record cabinet. It was one of the half dozen records that I gave a spin to decide if they were worth keeping, and the only one of them to make it safely back to the cupboard (rather than the bin). More than that, it was a moving experience. Although some of the instrumentation and production sounds a little dated, this is a strangely up-to-date work of art that out-achieves many fine recent offerings (e.g. Radiohead) on their home turf.<br />The most remarkable aspect of all VdGG's work was the lyrics. Peter Hammill was (and remains) an accomplished and visionary poet in his own right (how many other rock lyricists have had their work published in book form?) whose prophetic insight has stood the test of history. When he was actually putting pen to paper in the swinging sixties and early seventies his words seemed too black, too preoccupied with social fragmentation, too pessimistic. We still thought we were going to carve out some kind of hippy utopia here on earth.<br />If only New Wavers of the later seventies had listened to Van der Graaf (and Hammill's solo albums) instead of slagging them along with the other glam and prog behemoths of the era, they might have recognised kindred spirits (although no new wave band ever approached Hammill's clarity or beauty of expression). Hammill could have been to New Wave what Neil Young was to Grunge - a sort of grandfather in arms - and who knows we might have escaped the horrific excesses of New Romanticism.<br />Hammill takes the alienation and sorrow and doubt and loneliness that in my adolescent years were mainly confined to the experience of socially retarded individuals, and imagines . . . what if these pains were felt not just by lonely individuals, but collectively by a whole lonely civilisation? (&quot;A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers&quot;)? What would happen if a whole society developed suicidal tendencies (&quot;Lemmings&quot;)? What will society be like when we are so dehumanised that men and women are thought of as no more than units of work (&quot;Man-Erg&quot;)? And of course those nightmarish pictures, which were once so much on the fringe of our artistic consciousness, are now mainstream. Sadly, the price of bringing these patterns within the grasp of a wider audience is that to present-day listeners they no longer seem prophetic . . . merely realistic.<br />The most remarkable thing of all - the aspect that makes Hammill's work into art rather than mere science - is that he is not afraid to find a glimmer of hope in the darkness. And he does so with the finesse that only a wordsmith of genius could pull off: &quot;What course is there left but to die&quot; all on its own means little today - that sort of thing has become the staple diet of Norwegian metal headbangers. But switch the final verse to this: &quot;What cause is there left but to live . . . (falsetto croon) in the hope of saving our children's children's little ones&quot; and you have a call to redemption that will bring string men out in goose-bumps.<br />The final lyrical flourish is to alternate a statement of despair (&quot;All things are apart&quot;) with a statement of transcendent unity (&quot;All things are a part&quot;). The fact that you might never spot this subtle exchanging of pain for acceptance without reading the lyrics in print is a measure of the composer's rugged integrity.<br />Imagine this awesome lyrical freight carried by a group of virtuoso musicians unafraid to experiment. The fact that some of the experiments don't quite work is part of the work's radical beauty. Steel yourself for moments of jarring noise and dissonance alternating with moments of melting sweetness. It is arguable that Hammill at his peak had the most beautiful voice in rock, and almost beyond argument that he possessed the greatest musical and dramatic range. Add the searing brilliance of Robert Fripp out of King Crimson, playing the sort of guitar that nobody else can copy even today (although Radiohead have tried once or twice). You end up with a statement unequalled in the history of rock music. <br />No compromise, just art. Easy listening it isn't, but truth and beauty are rarely pretty and never bland.
B00000ING2|4.0|This was above all one of the most original movies, directed by Joel Coen who brought you many other wierd sensed yet enchanting movies like; Fargo, Raising Arizona and, O Brother Where Art Though. Joel Coen also wrote this Dazzling story along with Ethan Coen and Sam Raimi[who did the Army of Darkness trilogy]. Simple Seeming Tim Robbins finds his way to the top, working above the evil Sidney J. Mussburger, who along with the other men of the company want to crash the corrperation and buy it cheap, assuming Robbins for an idiot, they make him president. Stupendis idea for a movie and very Extrordinary music by Carter Burwell, and Spectacular shots of the falls from the top of &quot;THE HUDSUCKER PROXY&quot; they must have used a green screen and computer graphic, but that alone is worth the viewing time, the story is so well put together with little people like Buzz the elevator man, and the man who works the clock, it will leave you pondering and thinking and wanting to see it again, it really has a great intreguing feeling about the movie that comes with the work of the Coen brothers.
B00003CXSP|3.0|A decade after the original SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, Anthony Hopkins is back as one of the most memorable characters to ever grace a movie or televison screen, the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter. It's too bad that most of the original's sophistication and style didn't come back with him. Uber hack Ridley Scott manages to add all the gore and guts that Jonathon Demme only hinted to in the first film--this is not for the squeamish. Hopkins is typically brilliant, going just short of over-the-top, and also manages far more screen time than the half hour or so he took up last time. Julianne Moore does a fair job as FBI agent Clarice Starling--it is admittedly a little jarring at first thinking of anyone but Jodie Foster in the role, but as the movie progresses(and you realize that this in no way measures up to the original on any level), then you sort of just go with it. In the end, what you have is A-list actors stuck in a big budget, B-level horror flick.

6305909326|3.0|Roman Polanski's latest outing as director of the macabre is both amusing and disturbing, though never impressive. 'The Ninth Gate' was expected to be the director's comeback bid after the brilliant 'Death and the Maiden', and the top-notch star cast (save for Polanski's incredibly untalented wife) promised much. But what remains at the end of it is a confused, directionless film with no soul.<br />Johny Depp, who has been seen in better films such as 'Ed Wood', plays a heartless book dealer, who specializes in locating and trading valuable and rare books. The role seems interesting enough at the start of the film, and Depp's emotionless performance is intriguing, but after a while it just gets to be plain boring. He is hired by a mysterious satan-obsessed collector who wants him to trace two books that are supposedly written by Satan himself . If this isn't unbelievable enough, it gets even worse when Depp jumps at the idea (he does it for the money, people) and takes off for exotic foreign shores such as Lisbon and the French Riviera in search of the elusive works of the Devil. He also seems to have a Guardian Angel of sorts - a blonde puffy woman who follows him around everywhere. This role is played by Emanuelle Seigner, Polanski's real life wife, and its difficult to imagine a role more nonsensical. Its bad enough that Seigner is a depressingly poor actress, but to watch her drift in and out of the frames with no particular purpose, is quite enough. She fared far better in 'Bitter Moon' where she was cast aside Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott Thomas. She held her own in that film, but falters hugely in this one.<br />Depp's mission is this : armed with one of the books written by the Devil, he is to trace the other two and compare the contents, to decide which of the three is the original. This task seems hard to accomplish, as there are far too many people dying and too many weird incidents going on for Depp to feel comfortable. He is also followed around by Seigner and a dark-skinned motorbike-rider who seems to want him dead. Depp is repeatedly saved by Seigner, who reveals herself as non-human in one scene where she flies down the staircase rather than walk it (rather useful, don't you think?). The duo finally discover the secret behind this whole sorry tale, and the viewer is left wishing that they hadn't. This is not much of a story to begin with, but as the tale draws to a close, you begin to wonder if this really is a Polanski production. Everything is dismal, the lighting is bad, and the performances are third rate. Depp almost sleepwalks through the entire movie, even during the sex scenes (pity that they're as short as they are). Seigner, who has grown as an actress (and I mean this strictly in the physical sense of the term - she seems to have packed on at least 20 pounds since her last film) is eminently forgettable in her role as Angel, despite the secrets that are revealed about her toward the end of the movie (though you probably guessed it all along). The only time she looks remotely inspired is while shes riding Depp as they have sex outdoors. Its also the time Depp expresses any emotion, but its far too late for any of us to begin caring.<br />One wonders what the message of 'The Ninth Gate' is, and what the purpose behind making such a film is. The problem with this film is that it starts off looking terribly good - the opening sequences are very interesting - but half way down the line, you realize that it lacks any kind of direction. And despite Depp's dark, brooding role as a man with no conscience, his potrayal of the character is so ill-acted that its a shame. He could have done better, and one would say the same of Polanski.<br />Ultimately, the problem with 'The Ninth Gate ' is that it doesn't know what its about. If you want to know how a film shouldn't be made, then, by all means, rent this title (but for heaven's sake, don't buy it!). Personally, I haven't seen a film this confusing and disappointing, in years. Heres hoping that Polanski's next is something more upbeat, and something far more sensible.inting, in years.

B000002KJQ|5.0|This album is a classic album. ZZ Top was a hard driving boogie metal band. The music was bluesy and tough. I never understood why they went in the direction of \\"Eliminator\\". It worked for a couple of albums, but they have not dropped the electro sound now almost twenty years after \\"Eliminator\\". The person who ruined this classic with the fake drums should be brought to justice. This album sounds horrible now because of the 80's mix. If you don't have this album, buy it. We are going to have to listen to this version until they remaster the albums. That may be some time, because ZZ likes this sound on their albums. Note:\\"Deguello\\" was not changed and has the classic drumming on the cd.
0345409671|2.0|There were so many times while reading this book that I wanted to just scream and rip it to shreds! <br />And I am not talking about the particular thing that seems to catch so many as &quot;shocking&quot; and &quot;controversial.&quot; Please! The most shocking thing about this book is how bad it is! The interminable, excruciatingly boring passages where Memnoch recounts his tale is almost too much to bear. If it were not for the fact that I am a huge fan of the previous Vampire Chronicles (especially &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;), I would never have been able to finish the thing.<br />It is almost painful to read. It is so unbelievably self-conscious and pretentious. Yes, even more than you would expect from a &quot;Goth&quot; novel. The characters were totally unbelievable. Even Lestat was a pale imitation of himself! She trots out Armand and Louis and Mael and Maharet in a procession of gratuitous cameos -- none of them display a shred of the character she has imbued them with in other works. David Talbot has (slightly) more of a role in this story than the others do, but it is sadly empty as well.<br />The central story is a product of Rice's constant escalation of the stakes with Lestat. What to do after Akasha? Well, how about the DEVIL! The cheek! Her attempts to offend with the constant barrage of pseudo-blasphemy were just too over the top to be taken seriously enough for offense.<br />Her ideas about God and the Devil and Heaven and Hell and Scripture and History are so thoroughly flawed that incredulous amusement almost overtook irritation as the dominant reaction to the book. I kept reading until the end, hoping beyond hope that she would somehow redeem this tragic installment to the Chronicles. But no. It got worse and less believable up to the last, heavy-handed page.<br />Her &quot;theosophy&quot; is a joke. And in very poor taste. She plays so fast and loose with Scripture, that it is insulting to anyone familiar with it, religious or not. The root conflict of the story is that Rice doesn't like the &quot;problem of suffering.&quot; A millennia-old debate that she cheapens with a whining shrillness that  confirms how ill-prepared she is to tackle the subject matter.<br />She puts words in God's mouth that betray her own personal issues. It is needlessly, pointlessly abhorrent. Purposefully so. From the asinine things she has God and Christ saying, to Lestat's CONSTANT obsession with Dora's menstruating -- culminating in one of the most amazingly horrid scenes where Lestat, freshly returned from three days in Hell and exhausted beyond all measure, can only manage to summon the strength to fall on Dora and suck all the blood out of her womb, even detailing the draining of her bloody maxi-pad! I'm not making this up! This is beyond trash! The context of this atrocious scene in no way calls for anything remotely like this behavior. It was as if in her notes she had &quot;make sure to really push the whole menses thing, really &quot;shake up&quot; people.&quot; Well, steeping to the merely gross is no substitute for thoughtful, provocative literature.<br />Christ shows Lestat the Passion, the Crucifixion, his plan to save humanity by sacrificing himself. She dismisses this offhandedly by showing us a brutal historical scene of the sack of Constantinople -- with the juvenile sensibility that because there is horror and violence done to the innocent, therefore God's efforts are all a &quot;mistake.&quot; Look at all the evil done in God's name! Well, that just proves it! Case closed! <br />Throughout we are treated to the concept that we -- us humans -- hate God. That he had no right to put us on this suffering planet, and that those who die will no doubt be consumed with nothing but hatred for God, thereby unfairly condemning those souls to purgatory. It is laughable! We have rights? God owes us something? This is like a child whining about \\"unfair!\\" She refers to the Book of Job, but obviously cannot grasp the whole point of it. (It's kind of embarrassing.) <br />According to Rice, the whole Jesus Christ thing was the Devil's idea! But God, ever the bumbling fool, keeps making mistakes. Like he allows himself to be martyred &quot;while retaining the knowledge that he is God.&quot; This is supposed to be a big argument between Memnoch, the loving, caring, smart one, and God, the omnipotent buffoon. Memnoch claims that God cannot know true suffering unless God gives up his power and knowledge. Once again, her knowledge of Scripture is appallingly meager. What of the pivotal moment in the Passion, prominent in all the synoptic Gospels, where Christ, on the cross, cries out to heaven &quot;Lord, Lord, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot; Totally ignored. And what of Christ's prayers to the Father at Gethsemene? I would have thought she would weave this into her story, as it was right there with the crux of her topic. But no. That would ruin her pat little &quot;theosophy&quot; about the big, dumb insensitivity of God. There are a thousand holes in her argument. Those whose thoughts have been provoked by it should try Kafka or Watts or Lewis or Nietzsche, to name but a few. Try some meat before you go off thinking this thin broth has flavor.<br />She ends it with the customary defiance of Lestat. Only this time she has inflated her story to the point that all that is left for him to defy is both God and the Devil! Yes, Lestat has beaten them both, shown himself the superior being, clearly smarter, the most beautiful, and by far the coolest! Oh, and look at his stylish, expensive clothes! To die for! Oh!<br />This book shows a Lestat more shallow and flat than any other. Or, more accurately, this time around, Rice shows herself more shallow and flat than ever.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is a movie unlike anything I could have possibly imagined. Never before have I watched something so innovative. This movie is only for thinkers. If you want to be brain-washed by mindless action and romance, stay away. However, if you want mental challenge like no other film can possibly hope to accomplish, then watch this movie. Make sure you are not drunk, sleepy, distracted, etc. Be at 100% full attention because this movie is going to utilize every last one of your brain cells. You will not understand everything after one viewing either, as it takes at least 2 times through before everything clicks together. There are tons of VERY subtle hints and foreshadows. If you're into finding clues and innuendos, then you could not be possibly more delighted.
B000001DQG|5.0|This is an often overlooked CD.  Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me and The energetic The Bitch Is Back are more commercial hits but the other tracks are very touching.  Pinky has some beautiful chords and Ticking is an emotional masterpiece.  The additional of Pinball Wizzard and Step Into Christmas only elevates this work.  Pick it up soon, you will not be dissappointed.
0064407667|1.0|Okay, I love Harry Potter.  I love Roald Dahl and Charles Dickens.  I love the Addams Family and the episode where Susan died from licking cheap stationery on \\"Seinfeld.\\"  But I hated this book!  I found it incredibly sadistic toward children.  When a man tells a little girl on p. 49 (after \\"taking her face in his rough hands\\"), \\"...try not to anger Count Olaf , or he might wreck that pretty little face of yours\\", I had to quit reading.  Babies are threatened with being dropped from high heights.  The baby is also locked in a birdcage, tied up, and left with a piece of tape over its mouth.  I'm sorry, but this sounds like the musings of some child-hating mysogynist to me and I couldn't bring myself to read another word.  I'm deeply disturbed that Harper is passing this off as entertainment for children.  For those who are comparing this to Roald Dahl, Charles Dickens, or Harry Potter when he was still living in the Dursley's cupboard, I can only say that those books had a message of hope, of good triumphing over evil.  THE BAD BEGINNING reminds me more of something someone's dirty-minded old uncle would write while huddled in his basement watching kiddie porn.  Ick!  I'm off to wash my hands and take this book back to the bookstore.
B000002OZY|4.0|This Rock Opera is just loaded with great songs.  Townsend was sure at a creative high with this release.  Acid Queen, We're Not Gonna Take It, Overture, Pinball Wizzard, and I'm Free are all classics but Christmas, Go To The Mirror, and You Didn't Hear It are overlooked gems.  Underture is way overlong and some of the short snipets are a bit annoying. The Listening To You Theme is a little overdone.  None the less to get so many quality songs on a double CD is rare. And the vocal arrangements are certainly top knotch. This Rock Opera led to some other highly celebrated works like Pink Floyd's The Wall and The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway by Genesis.  A sure fire winner.
B00003CXSP|3.0|This movie has some of the best acting. Hannibal, Verger, Starling, all done superbly. Let me just say, people gave this an unfair rating. People were dissapointed that this isn't Silence of the Lambs II. This is a whole different movie. Just like Ridley Scott said in the DVD case(which you'll just have to read for yourself).<br /><br />So, my advice is get it. Watch it knowing it's a totally new movie. And don't watch this and eat at the same time.
B000001EGA|4.0|This is certainly a very creative Elton John rlease.  Its hard to pick up on all the catchy hooks and piano embellishments during the first listen.  None the less, the songs certainly sing like symphonies once you've played this for the thrid or fourth time.  Each track is certainly a winner although I prefer Tower of Babel, Better Off Dead, Someone Saved My Life Tonight, and Writing somewhat to the others.  And now the CD has Philadelphia Freedom and Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds as well as a track that I have not heard before.  I guess you readers can tell that I have the lp version.  None the less its a solid four/four and a half rating.

B00005214X|4.0|Certainly one of George Harrison's premiere efforts. And there are two CD's in this collection. Most of the songs are spiritual but there is so much meaning behind them. Some people have a problem with the jams but I kind of lack them. The mood just grooves during that section. As I said before in an earlier review pick this one up.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I love this movie but it is based on the premise that we, the audience, are trying, along with some reporter, to find out what Rosebud was because it was the final word of Kane.  Sooooo, my question is, &quot;Who heard him say this word in the movie?&quot;  I guess that the reporter was called by someone who was watching the movie and told that the last word Kane uttered was Rosebud.  You know; like in &quot;Spaceballs&quot; when they watch themselves on the video of the movie that they are starring in at the present time.  I also would recommend the movie &quot;RKO 281&quot; which tells the story of getting this movie made and, more importantly, distributed.  Lots of famous Hollywood and New York people wanted this film destroyed.  You also will learn what Rosebud really referred to when Kane/Hearst used the term.  Anyway it is great entertainment and I guess I really enjoy it because Welles was such a &quot;loose cannon&quot; in Hollywood and did what he wanted with his movies- as best he could while fighting studio heads.

B000002I2G|4.0|The Soft Parade is an interesting mix of songs and styles as the Doors continued experimenting with their sound. The addition of a horn section is great and gives depth to some of these songs. <br />This album is not for all and those looking for the pure rock and roll of their first album or the bluesiness of LA Woman, wont find that here. But what you will find are some gems.<BR>&quot;Touch Me&quot; is a very pop sounding song, &quot;Shamans Blues&quot; showcases Krieger and Manzericks panache. &quot;Easy Ride&quot; is a loopy sounding, carnival piece. The album ends strongly with &quot;Wild Child&quot;, &quot;Runnin' Blue&quot; where Jim pays tribute to Otis Redding, the brooding &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot; and the classic 8 and a half minute &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; which is up there as one of my favourite all time Doors songs; it showcaes their enormous talent and ability to switch into different musical genres as the song goes on. All members playing their part brilliantly, with Jims opening declaration sending the song off, allowing Krieger and Manzerick to start a slow, reflective feel, that builds into a party of sound and fun. By the end you can be excused for thinking that you have heard four or five different songs all connected. A great tune! <br />Overall, 'The Soft Parade' is a very good album. It is not the Doors most famous or most loved album, but nonetheless is full of songs with a variety of sound and appeal. Not quite worthy of 5 stars, but its not far away.

B00005B58Y|5.0|I'd consider &quot;Milestones&quot; one of Miles Davis' five or so best albums, which means it's probably one of the best 15 or so albums in the entire jazz genre and perhaps one of the top 40 in any genre.<BR>If you listen to the first two tracks and find it a bit off-kilter (&quot;Dr. Jekyll&quot;) or slow (&quot;Sid's Ahead&quot;), keep listening. The final four tracks, particularly the brilliant &quot;Miles&quot; / &quot;Milestones,&quot; will get you hooked. In fact, while Thelonious Monk gets credit for his classic composition &quot;Straight, No Chaser,&quot; I believe that this album's version is the definitive one -- much like &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; may be a Bob Dylan song, but it really belongs to Jimi Hendrix.<BR>Don't hesitate to buy it and make it a regular part of your collection. &quot;Milestones&quot; is well worth it!

0792836634|3.0|Child's Play deals with a killer dying and entering his soul into a children's doll in a toy store. The doll, Chucky, is given to a little boy named Andy as a present by his mom. The doll comes to life and starts knocking people off. He wants to enter his soul into a human body before he's trapped in the doll's body forever. This movie is a lot of fun. It is filled with pretty good suspense and acting. At one moment it's thrilling, and the next it's kind of funny. Alex Vincent, who plays Andy, is not the greatest kid actor, but he's fine. Catherine Hicks, who plays his mom, is the best of the bunch. Fans of her work as the mother on TV'S &quot;7TH Heaven&quot; will be surprised. Brad Douriff as the killer and Chris Sarandon as the cop who killed him, round out the cast. All used well. The steam was sort of missing from the sequels, but they were all enjoyable nonetheless. Not great, but fun. Child's Play is a simple, enjoyable little film. Give it a try.

B000001EXB|2.0|First of all, The Big Picture isn't a bad album. It's just not what one would of hoped it would be. This album is a disappointment. Especially coming off a string of good albums like \\"Sleeping With The Past\\", \\"The One\\", \\"Made In England\\", and the greatest ballad hits collection, \\"Love Songs\\". This album is fairly low tempo. There are a few mid tempo songs, but not many. That's alright. It's just the low tempo ones are a little too long and unmemorable. There are high points. \\"Something About The Way You Look Tonight\\", \\"The Big Picture\\", \\"Wicked Dreams\\", \\"If The River Can Bend\\", \\"Love's Got A Lot To Answer For\\", are the high points. The rest aren't bad, they just don't seem to hit the right notes. Elton, by the way, sounds great. He always does. This was just a disappointment. Not that great. Could of been so much better.
B00005LB9O|5.0|I heard Travis's song &quot;Side&quot; at 2 AM in the morning on MTV and I loved it right away.  I thought the cd was going to be different ad have more hard rock songs.  But their songs are mellow and cool.  Some of the songs are really deeply depressing like &quot;Dear Diary&quot; and &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; and The Humpty Dumpty Love Song&quot;,  but then there are inspirational songs like &quot;Flowers In The Window&quot; and &quot;Follow The Light&quot;.  Then there are songs about the meaning of life like &quot;Side&quot; and &quot;Last Train&quot; and the occasional love songs like &quot;Sing&quot; and &quot;Safe&quot;.  So anyone could relate to at least one song on this cd.  So no matter who you are, this cd is for you.
0684800713|5.0|No other American has written better about what it is like to be an American in Europe. Hemingway seemed to belong there. The Paris memoir A Moveable Feast is a beautiful account of those early days when Hemingway was writing his early stories. The Sun Also Rises is something quite different. Not a memoir but a novel. And a great one. Great not just because it describes 1920's Paris, which is no doubt part of it's appeal, but because it describes Americans living abroad in the aftermath of WWI. Though it does not specifically address the war, the style of life and attitude that these characters exemplify make them members of what Gertrude Stein called &quot;the lost generation&quot;. That phrase defined a generation and Hemingway's book was the best comment on that phrase and his generation. The American characters of Sun Also Rises all have their reasons for being in Europe. Part of the reason is that WWI disrupted all the old notions and fabric of society and Hemingway underlines this by showing them all in a state of aimless drift. With Jake Barnes Hemingway shows an American who understands Europeans and is at home in their company. He is a new kind of consciousness, not a representative one, but one that seems to have an understanding of life that other Americans do not. Jake's unique understanding has led him to the formulation of a code(expatriots code) which is not altogether explained but one which allows him to be at home in all cultures and deal with trying situations very well(most of the time). But Jake too is wounded. Jakes presence attracts an unusual group of friends and hangers on(some American, some European). Those who understand the code get along well with Jake and those who do not find themselves in conflict with him. Hemingway's A Sun Also Rises stands in interesting contrast to Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby. While Fitzgerald goes for a mythic rendering of American life , Hemingway describes a new kind of ground that only he occupies. Hemingway brings an understanding to things which is not specifically American but his own hard won ground. Fiction writing one imagines was his way of defining that ground. &quot;You must get to know the values,&quot; as the Count says. Each character presents an almost separate plot line. The book begins with Cohn's story but several other stories intertwine along the way as new characters arrive on the scene. Jake is the center around which all the action revolves. Although an awful lot of action revolves around Brett as well. Every one has their turn with Brett. The sad thing is that the two who should be together are Jake and Brett and yet they can't be. And that seems to be the overall feeling and theme of the book and perhaps the deepest interpretation of the oft used phrase &quot;lost generation&quot;. The war seems to have cheated a whole generation out of its innocence, and with that it's ability to love, perhaps. The bullfight segment which is very exciting is a kind of moment when all the characters try to in their own way fill their lives with something. If you want a happier book about Paris read Hemingway's A Moveable Feast instead.ings an understanding to things which is not specifically American but his own hard won ground.

0792844890|4.0|I can still remember the first time I watched Spaceballs.  I was about 9 years old, at a friend's house for a sleepover.  I'd already eaten an enormous bag of potato chips, and drank so much Coke that my joints were aching from the sugar and caffeine.  After laughing so hard it hurt for an hour and a half, I threw up and had to go home.  To this day, I cannot eat plain potato chips without getting nauseous, and I have Mel Brooks and Spaceballs to thank for it.<br />Spaceballs, like Brooks' other movies (Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights) is a spoof of all things SciFi - and the ridiculous (ludicrous?) marketing blitz surrounding movies like Star Wars.  Plot is unimportant: Lone Star, a kind of space cowboy who drives around in a Winnebago with wings, has to rescue Princess Vespa, a snob who ran away on her wedding day, and save her planet from the Spaceballs, an evil race that wears gigantic Magic 8 Balls on their heads (and rear ends, too).  The movie is a collection of scenes and jokes from different science fiction and action movies popular in the 1970s and 1980s, some of which border on the inanely stupid and some of which (Pizza the Hut comes to mind) are still funny today.<br />It's a good and funny movie, if your idea of good is what a 9-year-old boy at a sleepover would find good and funny.  It's also a great retro-piece for us children of the 1980s, and is a relatively inexpensive DVD for the fond memories it elicits.  The DVD itself is great: a tight-as-nails video transfer and a solid 2.0 sound track to match.  Brooks' commentary can be funnier than the movie, although his Jewish jokes get a little old after a while (especially if you're seen them done over and over in his films.)<br />At this price, it's a hard disc to beat.  There is a rumor that MGM plans to revisit this movie along with several of Brooks' other films sometime in mid-2002; if you can't wait that long, 12 bucks is a pittance for a transfer this good and a commentary track this entertaining, even if the movie has lost a little of its shine as we've grown up.<br />Let the Schwartz be your guide, if you can't decide.a commentary track this entertaining, even if the movie has lost a little of its shine as we've grown up.<br />Let the Schwartz be your guide, if you can't decide.

B0000214F0|3.0|Some epics are famous for their content.  Braveheart, for instance, revitalized interest in William Wallace and might be credited with drumming up support for the Scottish National Party and the new Scottish Parliament.  Others are famous for their quirks; Spartacus director Stanley Kubrick employed the &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot; blacklist, a group of people accused of communist activities by the McCarthy witchunt.  Still others, like Lawrence of Arabia, are so unique in their locations, subject matter, and cinematographic pioneering that they top the list of influences of every major movie director - and a lot of the minor directors, too.<br />Caligula, on the other hand, is famous for being the most expensive pornography film ever created.<br />I'm not going to bother summarizing plot, as there really isn't any to speak of.  Obstinately, it's a historical epic about Emperor Caligula, the ruler that was responsible for such excellent history-class tibits as naming his horse a Senator and marching the Roman Garrison into the ocean because he'd declared war on Neptune, drowning them by the thousands.  And you thought our presidents were bad!  The movie, from a script by Gore Vidal (that he attempted to disown), details Caligula's personal insanity, including his incestuous relationships with his sister and the forces that plot against him, both real and imaginary.<br />Say what you will about the film, it is still a $15 million porno flick, with better actors than usual.  If you're going to take the plunge to buy it, then get the blue-packaged Unrated version.  Not only does it have the extra hardcore, but it is the only one with 5.1 sound and the interview segment with Gore Vidal himself.  The DVD is OK; the title screens are well-done, but the video transfer looks almost like a VHS tape, fuzzy and full of dust.  Sound, at least on the Unrated version, is decent, making full use of all channels, but it is pretty obvious that the soundtrack wasn't remastered for the DVD release.<br />If you're feeling particularly masochistic, there's no reason to add this title to your collection, other than just to have it there.  Fans should pay the extra for the Unrated version, but anyone who hasn't seen it will probably want to make the trip to their local video store first.VD release.<br />If you're feeling particularly masochistic, there's no reason to add this title to your collection, other than just to have it there.

Rufus Wainwright will not exhaust you with overrused expressions, but he will probably impress your English teacher with literary allusions. Rufus Wainwright won't learn a hip new step to go with his songs, but he will probably wear a really fabulous scarf. Poses combines pretty piano pieces with funky electric drums, and imperial string arrangements with folky acoustic guitars. Rufus will sing to you of a Rebel Prince and an Evil Angel. He'll take you to Greece on a motorbike, and then wisk you off to Paris. He will be frank about his affinities for cigarettes and chocolate milk, but he'll tease you with &quot;those other things, which for several reasons we won't mention.&quot; With a sort of nasal melancholiac passion in his voice, Rufus can bring you to tears on the title track Poses, and make you laugh out loud on the single California with his winning wit and charm. To categorize Poses is to try to fit an elephant through a mousehole. Its just too big.
0345347951|4.0|Along with Rendevouz with Rama, this is probably one of A.C. Clarke's best known works (not counting 2001).  In it he paints a portrait of an Earth under the protective wing of the Overlords, but man has no explaination...nor do they really need one.  Only a handful of humans question the motives of the Overloads who have abolished everything from disease to poverty to war.  The book is broken into three sections:  arrival, the golden age, and the last generation.  Each part is populated with believable and vulnerable characters.  The only constant throughout the book is Karellen the Overlord who is the Supervisor of Earth.  It is his task to prepare mankind for the destiny that awaits them.<br />Clarke does a great job making us feel like we are insignificant in this universe, and that there are stranger and more fantastical things possibly awaiting us.  The concept of the ending (whick I won't give away), or the hook, of this book is quite interesting.  While not a 5 starrer in my book, this is a great read, and one of the classis that has truly earned it's label.  READ MORE CLASSICS!

I donÕt know if itÕs MorrisonÕs best (there are just too many riches to choose from), but I know it is an absolutely flawless album, made up of ten perfectly crafted songs, not one of them less than stellar.<br />ItÕs also the only one of his albums I know of Ð the only album by anyone, for that matter Ð that is rewarding to listen to no matter what kind of music youÕre in the mood for. Unlike Astral Weeks, or Veedon Fleece, which you wonÕt appreciate unless youÕre willing to sit down and listen carefully, Moondance can work as high-energy background music while youÕre doing something else. The horns, the rhythm, that soothing, but never bland voice Ð it has a soulful, jazzy groove that wonÕt quit and is fun to listen to over and over.<br />But it has another side. When youÕre ready, sit down and pay attention and youÕll find lyrics as deep and poetic as anything on Astral Weeks, and fine, subtle, soulful singing that youÕll miss when youÕre just focusing on the big, brassy sound. ItÕs not just that Van Morrison has a gorgeous, soul-shaking voice, and brilliant phrasing, although he certainly does. He sings with so much genuine passion that he makes you see the world in a whole new way. And It Stoned Me, for instance, is about nothing more than water Ð fishing, swimming, rain and drinking Ð but the way he sings &quot;oh, the water&quot; makes the experience shine like great poetry. <br />I donÕt know any other album that has it all the way Moondance does. No matter how many times you listen to it, you can never exhaust its possibilities. I have hundreds of CDs, but, hands down, this is the one I play the most.
B00003CX9W|4.0|I bought this set. they said it was restored with theatrial aspect ratio. they ... mines 4:3. bought mine at a local store, im taking it back. Do they think just because most people dont care that it doesnt matter. DVD features should be more then just writen on the box, it would be nice if they were on the DVD.
B00005KHJR|5.0|Yes, ignore those reviewers that don't actually own or compare the various versions, the extended release on the new Wicker Man Limited Edition is actually longer than the supposedly 102 minute Media VHS release.  I've watched them side by side and the DVD actually includes an short verbal exchange between Sgt Howie and Mrs. Morrison that is missing from the Media version. Other than that they are identical.<br />The only misstep I can see is they used the low quality ending credits in the extended version, possibly thinking they would be different.  But a side by side comparison of the set's short version and extended version shows they are identical - they should have used the higher quality footage.<br />I've been waiting for a complete edition of this on DVD for years.  Thank you Anchor Bay!
B00002E23E|4.0|If not for the silly fantasy sequences interspersed throughout the concert footage, I'd give this a &quot;5&quot; rating. A must-have for any Led Zeppelin fan, especially because the movie contains two live songs ((1) an edited version of &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; with most of the Page solo intact and (2) a raw, blistering version of &quot;Black Dog&quot; with the &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; riff lead-in) that never made it onto the double-album vinyl (and for that matter, CD) motion picture soundtrack version, probably because there wasn't enough space. Too bad Jimmy Page didn't take the time to put a real &quot;bonus features&quot; section into the DVD which he could have used to include unused, left-over footage from these MSG '73 shows (which he presumably has possession or control of) or some later concerts from the '75 and '77 tours of which bootleg video tape versions exist. Regardless, a keeper DVD through and through.
B000021YQV|5.0|Well, not sure if I'm gonna be the first reviewer... but in any case, here's my review:<br />Of course in light of all the recent good/notorious news about this Armenian LA-based genius band (including the *famous* free concert in Hollywood this September), I believe the fame of System of a Down is now spread pretty much all across the country. Their first self-titled album has grown a huge fanbase in California, especially among the large Armenian community. No wonder that all the songs from their highly-anticipated &quot;Toxicity&quot; sieved through the Internet way before the release date. <br />Not only I perceive &quot;Toxicity&quot; as a big step forward for System, but also also an incredibly strong statement in today's rock music. SOAD is boldly diverse, rich and deep. Their lyrics are politically-oriented and poignant which truly makes them new &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot;, they are aggressive and powerful, yet that does not keep them away from producing remarkable melodic tunes. Their rhythm can change many times within a song ranging from a roaring speed, then suddenly turning into a marvellous slow melody. One definite plus of SOAD is their cultural heritage. A lot of times you can hear Armenian musical influence, which drives to its apex on the album's closing instrumental track &quot;Arto&quot; (a prayer for the dead), where the band uses Armenian duduk and hums the melody. <br />For those who still ponder on whether to buy or not to buy, let me make this clear: System of a Down is not a band, it's a huge historical event that was bound to happen sooner or later. I can't remember being so fascinated by music as I am by these guys. &quot;Toxicity&quot; is a masterpiece. Among the recent primited headbanger bands, they remain one of the very few who can produce such a masterpiece. Buy this album, you won't be disappointed!<br />Here's a short breakdown song by song:<br />1. Prison Song - as far as I know this is one of their early works and themost politically-poignant. Written by D.Malakian, the song is about... you guessed it, about American prison system. This song should become a darling of their upcoming concert tours.<BR>2. Needles - another poignant track, this time about drugs<BR>3. Deer Dance - ooooohhhh, this one just blows me away! Once again, bold politically-oriented lyrics about riots and invisible police.<BR>4. Jet pilot - ever had a ride with the speed of light? An incredibly fast and aggressive music. reminds slightly of the early Slayer style<BR>5. X - Another fast song starting with Malakian's guitar riffs flowing into sabbath-like bass and scary roars saying a very disturbing statement &quot;We don't need to multiply - Show your people how we die&quot;. <br />6. And here comes Chop Suey - the single made available to the public on their website... Words cannot describe the beauty of this song. A definite masterpiece. Oh, also make sure to catch the video of this song - the first video off &quot;Toxicity&quot; shot in Hollywood with armenian flag waving in the background.<br />7. Bounce - sounds more like a crafty theatrical performance than a heavy metal song. That's exactly what I meant when I was talking about the main theme and rhythm changing within their songs. The song's duration is less than 2 minutes, and they *bounce* the rhythm so many times... Highlights Tankian's amazing singing abilities.<br />8. Forest - walk with me a little while and make the forest turn to wine. Amongst all the insignificant lyrics by other bands a la &quot;let the bodies hit the floor&quot;, this is a breath of fresh air. And the music is impeccable. Again, they don't sound like anything else, this is something unique. The rhythm and chorus on this song is also great. <br />9. ATWA - remember &quot;Spiders&quot;? This song is from the same apartment block. Serj Tankian keeps shocking with his voice. Starting off slowly and quietly, the song suddenly gets an adrenaline rush and goes into an aggressivetone with Tankian roaring repeats &quot;You don't care about how I feel -  I don't feel herrrr anymorrrrr&quot;. The background vocals by Malakian is another innovation from their previous album.<br />10. Science - Interesting start with solo/bass cringing sounds. Science has failed our world? Great song with a visit to the Middle East in the middle. <br />11. Shimmy - roller coaster ride. Excellent job by J. Dolmayan on drums!<br />12. Version 7.0 - this is my favorite song on the album. Not sure if it's gonna make it to the live performances, but I'd surely love to hear it live. Outstanding vocals. <br />13. Psycho - a song about serial killer Mason. Very controversial and disturbing. Sounds like the lyrics don't endorse the serial killing, but rather attempt to represent the mentatlity of a serial killer. <br />14. Aerials - Ohhh My God! Is this a heavy metal band singing like this? Hard to believe that &quot;Deer Dance&quot; and &quot;Aerials&quot; are written by the same band. That's the diversity I've been talking about. Correct me if I'm wrong, but is there an Indian citar here or... ?<br />15. Arto. The closing instrumental. A mourning for the dead performed with Armenian duduk and coke bottles. It's a kind of a tribal mix sieved trough Armenian melody. Voice humming sounds haunting here.<br />Final comments: best album of the decade!
0425180638|1.0|My husband and I just finished THE LAST PRECINCT. We have now read all of the Kay Scarpetta books, and probably won't read any more of them. Patricia Cornwell has a real gift for orchestrating grisly plots, but nothing more. Her main characters all sound alike: stilted and sullen. Kay Scarpetta has built her life to order, and all she does is whine. In fact, no one ever smiles or laughs in these books. They ooze the determined, self-obsessed misery of folks who have never truly suffered a day in their lives. We held some hope for THE LAST PRECINCT because of the blurbs: &quot;...takes readers deeper into Kay Scarpetta's heart and soul than ever before&quot; . . . &quot;'Where do you go when there is nowhere left?'&quot; Could it be that Scarpetta would finally undergo the epiphany she so badly needs, and be forced to work her way through the chip on her shoulder? Nope. These characters age but they never grow. And we're just too depressed to care any more.
B00004KD1L|4.0|The duet from the UK represents all that downtempo textures and flavor stands for. This is the freshman release from these UK-based DJs. Those expecting more of the cheesy lyrics found off the single 'I See You Baby' will be way off base. The river flowing from this album is filled with downtempo dips, jazz hooks, and blunted-bass tones which when put together, makes for some serious head-bobbing beats.  Cato's formal jazz training comes through on many of the tracks and I was amazed at the horn work which was infused with the deep downtempo bass rythms. Special stand outs are Dusk You & Me, Chicago, Inside My Mind, and Your Song.  At The River is the album's lynchpin and takes the listener on a ride filled with a steady bass and percussion combination along with one of the best muted horn solos I've ever come across. <br />This was one of my favorite purchases of 2000 and I still listen to it. This album is not as uptempo as St. Germain's \\"Tourist\\" album and don't compare it to Fatboy Slim; those looking for a more uptempo/dance version of this CD will want to check out G.A.'s \\"Remixes\\" which has similar art work on the cover.
0141301120|4.0|This book lacks some of the focus and the sheer joy of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but it is a delight nonetheless -- Charlie, Mr. Wonka and Charlie's family take the Great Glass Elevator around for some wild adventures.<br />It's a sequel, folks. And, frankly, when you are the sequel to the greatest children's book ever written, that's a hard act to live up to. Dahl does a decent job, so I give him 4 stars.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is a great Album.  I can hear my grandma singing &quot;You are my sun shine&quot;.  It has made me look into bluegrass and Alison Krause.  I hate to say I got the album to play while painting I have music for different kinds of work and this is perfect.  You should see the painting.  Makes you feel good again.
0141301155|5.0|This book ignited my love of reading when my second-grade teacher read it to the class over the course of a month in the middle of the day, a chapter or two at a time...I looked forward to going to school every day just so I could hear the next chapter. After it was over, I had to get my own copy, which I did -- and promptly wore it out and had to buy another. I think I have read it something like 30 times, and the story has cap<br />You know the story -- about a poor kid in a poor family who has to eat cabbage soup every day, who loves chocolate but can not afford it. One day, however, the most magical thing ever happens to him -- he wins one of the five golden tickets to the nearby Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory. <br />This is a wonderful book in so many ways, but especially in modern American suburbs where children often grow up spoiled with riches. This book shows them that, yes, some children grow up too poor for chocolate bars, and also shows them how loathesome spoiled children of various types are. There is the obnoxious bubble gum chewer, the TV-obsessed kid and the glutton.<BR>Willy Wonka teaches each of them -- and the reader -- a valuable lesson.<br />On top of that, it is such a fun story -- with amazing candies that will delight children of all ages (including their parents).<br />Every child should read this book, or have it read to them. It is absolutely the best children's book ever written. I can give it no higher recommendation.
B00002E23H|5.0|When I first saw &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; I was expecting a &quot;Jaws&quot; Ripoff.  This dosent even come close.  The plot is that on a reaserch station out far from shore (Arnt they all?) we have a group of your typical heroes, the scientest dedicated to her work, the butiefull assistant, the gung ho hunter with a slight accent, the disastor survivor, the religious cook,etc.  They are experimenting with sharks to find a cure for alzhimers disiese.  While this is a noble cause, things of course go wrong and mindless violence and blood ensures.  This film is a mix of &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;The posiedon adventure&quot; and it turns out pretty well.  There are lots of &quot;Escape the flooding room, corridor, etc&quot; moments with lots of blood and deaths.  The acting is good and there are funny moments (Especially the &quot;Big Stick&quot; joke near the end)  And at times there are just &quot;Yeah right&quot; moments.  The sharks, although they are nowhere near as frightinging as the &quot;Jaws&quot; dude, are basically well done and a bit scary.  The biggest issue I have is that there are lots of deaths.  And I mean LOTS of them.  In fact all but a few of the characthers die.  The bottom line is that if you want a film whith a great story, lots of charachter development and a moral, dont see this movie.  However if you want water action, with lots of people in wetsuits getting eaten, watch this.  Its just mindless fun.<br />The good: lots of water action, silly, some funny moments<br />The bad: Mindless, lots of deaths<br />And the ugly: Graphic deaths, not for kids
0141301139|5.0|Right up there with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Danny the Champion of the World and The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar as Dahl's best.<br />The clever Mr. Fox will have you laughing along with him as he outwits the farmers.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Sooooo...You are reading this review for one of two reasons: 1.You've been devoid of any human contact in the last five years and have never heard this album (In which case welcome back to society, stop reading this review and GET THIS ALBUM!!!!)or 2. You know of this album and you want to see what others think of it...Either way I doubt there is anything I could include in this review that hasn't already been said before, so I will be brief. Every once in a while a breakthrough is made so mind boggling that you wonder how anyone could have ever thunk it up. (e.g. Einstein's theory of relativity, indoor plumbing, the George Foreman Grill) I was eighteen when this album came out. I never had the pleasure of buying [insert your favorite Beatles, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones album here] right when it was released but with this disc I did. Granted, Axel Rose is a poet :) and grunge/alt rock was a good listen... OK Computer made me wonder who dropped this album off on Earth. This wasn't Creep...I wasn't sure what it was, but I knew I liked it. I still might not be able to analyze the humanist approach to inhumanity, but I don't need to, Thom Yorke did, with a voice that seems to hit you like an other wordly instruction from a super human entity, the album is something you own, not a few songs you download. Give Thom and the boys some more dinero for coming up with this masterpiece. If I had to limit my cd collection to 3 this would stay...if for no other reason than it grabs your humanity and smacks it around. I think everybody should experience that from an album in their lifetime. It might not reduce the amount of fat in your burgers and steaks, but then again what kind of magical grilling machine could do that?

0891416811|4.0|I first read this book in or around 1967.I was riveted by the accounts of the training for the paratroopers for combat in WWII. The author an 18 year old caught up in the idea of war enlists in the paratroopers and does a wonderful dsecriptive job telling about the bonding and closeness of the troopers as he takes the reader on his expolits through D-Day and beyond. A must read for ex-paratroopers. I have recommended this book to several friends who were paratroopers.
0385501560|5.0|Choke is an apologetic novel in which Chuck Palaniuk, author of Fight Club and contributing writer for Gear magazine takes us on a wrinkled tour of raw, guttural humanity. Palahniuk asks us to pretend to think deeply about the reason we treadmill through life hiding our problems and insecurities behind the guise of perceived imperfection and incapabilities.<br />Choke is the freeze-framed version of Fight Club that went over our heads in a cloud of nihilism. It was never about nihilism; it was about questioning the path that's brought us here.. This nine-inch nail is hit hard and driven past the cerebral cortex into the very crux of human depravity, emotion and despair.<br />Nymph-O and museum worker Victor Mancini discovers at a young age that - during a moment of choking - &quot;...the whole world cared what happened to him.&quot; When flailing and turning blue, he was on center stage and in a position to make the one who saved him a hero. Victor intentionally chokes to manipulate the &quot;hero&quot; nightly. The hero then plays a paternal/maternal role, virtually sponsoring his egregious lifestyle and subsidizing his Alzheimer's-exasperated mother. This also includes cards on birthdays, calls on holidays. <br />Thus Palahniuk constructs a cockamamie, ludicrous storyline and asks us to enjoy his humor and bizarre plot's unfolding. Laughing out loud is simply inescapable. But the plot is merely a physical embodiment that draws us inside. Although the storyline is absurd, that only sets up a foil for his brilliant microscoping of human emotions and desperation. The plot adds the thickness of void fulfillment upon introducing Denny the, um, rock-collector, except that is too casual. Denny is the comedic avatar of overkill.<br />Some have called Choke's Victor an antihero, but they are not seeing the big picture: heroes no longer take on the form of men in blue tights and red capes - the new hero, the Palahniuk hero fights his battles within his mind, life. This is represented by Choke's first-person cataloging of introspection and inner struggle not to decide based on precedent. <br />In Palahniuk's world, there is no Xanadu, no Brigadoon. The reality is dystopia. Within this construct tragic is interchangable with realistic. Life is not clean. &quot;There are chickens with no legs...Blind chickens without eyes. Without beaks. Born that way. Defective. Born with their little chicken brains already scrambled.&quot;
0553106635|5.0|Many times while reading a Storm of Swords I would forget I was reading a book. The world created by Martin is so compelling. There is very little of the redundancy that hampers many other books, even very good ones. Every word works hard in this (and the other two) novels.<br />I thought the series started a bit slow in A Game of Thrones. A Strom of Swords reads just as it is entitled and as in a true storm where rain and lightening march across the landscape seemingly at random yet not so, so too does the action in A Storm of Sword beat on the reader in a frenzied action packed manner. Martin has a plan and unveiling it is part of the excitement of reading this series.<br />I would give SoS six stars if I could. <br />Not for the very faint of heart but anyone who has gotten this far knows that already.
0767853636|4.0|I have watch the musical and the movie, though there are differences, both are great productions! Be it the stage production or the screen version, both are fun. And absolutely a delight to watch. It doesn't have to be historically correct. Just sit back, relaxed and enjoy the movie!
B00005NKTD|5.0|These are defiantly two best movies of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Predator is a very smart, scared, sci-fi movie with unpredictable plot. In my opinion, it is the best Arnold's movie and also is the best movie I have ever seen.  True Lies is a second greatest film of Arnold. It is creative and very original action movie with a lot of fighting, flying, and good humor. <br />In my opinion, Fox would better release &quot;Predator / Predator 2&quot; DVD set with a lot of features, behind the screen pictures, interviews and documentary. That would be a great product!!!
B00004RF9B|5.0|The initial reason I took a look at `Forbidden Planet' was because I'd heard that it influenced both Gene Roddenberry when he developed  `Star Trek', and George Lucas when he was conceptualizing the `Star Wars' saga. Any movie that was an inspiration to the two biggest sci-fi franchises of all time (and two of my faves) is definitely worth a viewing! <BR><BR> After growing up watching `Airplane!' and `The Naked Gun', it's kinda strange seeing Leslie Nielsen play a more-serious role as the ship's commander. No double-takes in reaction to strange sight gags? No droll one-liners with the straightest face one can imagine? Definitely something I'm not used to...<BR><BR>Then there's the introduction of one of sci-fi's ultimate legends- Robby the Robot! Being one of the more fortunate cast-members of this little adventure, Robby would make many subsequent appearances through the decades in TV-Land, including a throw-down with the `Lost In Space' robot, and staying over at Mork's place for a few days. I think he's hanging out in some Hollywood museum somewhere nowadays. If anybody knows where Robby's hangin' out nowadays, let me know! <BR><BR>Although I'm not an absolutist when it comes to movies in the widescreen, there are exceptions. This movie in particular is one of them. I remember two particular scenes- Robby giving a monkey a bit of a zap to make him behave, and the Cap'n having to vaporize a tiger- that went the full width of the screen, and looked really weird when the studio panned &amp; scanned it for the VHS release. In this case, for maximum cinema enjoyment, wider IS better! <BR><BR>`Late
B00005NW02|5.0|This cd is fantastic SOAD. The whole thing is pure rage. If you like their first album get this. Haven't stopped listening for over a week (got an &quot;advance&quot; copy)
0689835604|5.0|My son loves all books. The only time he will sit still is when I read to him. The rest of the time, he is on the move (even when he's eating). When I got him this book, he absolutely lit up! I had never seen a book elicit the kind of joy and amazement that this book does. So, it is defintely the favorite one in our house. I've read it to him hundreds of times, but he still giggles when I lift the first flap to expose Baby's eyes. He bends down to kiss every baby on every page. (Some of the pages are starting to stick together from all his wet kisses!) Some of the flaps are wearing down a bit from his uncoordinated hands trying to lift the flaps. But, I won't mind spending the extra $$ for a new one if I need to. The look on his face when I read him this book gets me every time!!
B000021YQV|5.0|3 words... Buy this Album. Period. This is the best album out this year so far excluding Tool's Lateralus. You know what? If I wasn't already a big Tool fan I would have to pick this album as the best of the year... Almost all the tracks are just mind blowing... heavy yet melodic... The best way I can describe the sound is Perfect Circle with the Intensity and drive and hard edge of Slayer. Highlights of the album include Chop Suey(excellent video by the way), Jet Pilot(strange lyrics that I've woken up singing in my head the last few mornings),Deer Dance, and Bounce.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I know that people complain about everything that Metallica does but don't judge them by trying new things.  I mean basically every CD Metallica has ever made was very different from the last I mean look at Master of Puppets to ... And Justice For All.  Justice was a heavier and more violent album while puppets was a faster album.  I like every CD Metallica has ever made and S &amp; M is no exception.  I think that Micheal Kamen and Metallica were able to give each song a new spin and I believe that Nothing Else MAtters is even better on S &amp; M.   I don't really understand why the Unforgiven and Fade to Black weren't included but every song is great.  If you just want to complaina about Metallica don't buy this CD, but if you are a true Metallica fan and love their CDS this has a song from every CD.  The only thing I can say bad about this is sometimes the orchestra can be louder than Hetfield and the riffs.  Buy this CD it is a new spin on Metallica!!!!
0671027573|4.0|This book was a quick, enjoyable read.  Why?  I liked meeting the principal characters, the romance and sex were hot, and there was a murder mystery with psychological implications, too.  What more could you ask?  The dialogue and exhanges between Jaine, Sam, and her friends were lively and fun.  The mystery element was not as finely handled as most of the other details of the book and that's why I can't give it 5 stars.  It was kinda like the Columbo TV series.  They tell you who the murderer is and then you have to wait for the other characters to catch on.  For some, the realization comes too late.
B00005NW02|5.0|Well I presumed nothing would top System's self depute album...I was wongs. 'Toxicity' is THE BEST heavy/rock album I have ever listened. Tracks such as ATWA and X touch an more of a sensitive side of the band, but dont worry, they keep their natural stile of playing in every track. Other tracks such as 'Arto' remind us where the band had originated from, Armenia with the insturment used 'doodook' (also originated from Armenia). This is very commendable for a foreign band to I'd recomend this album to anyone that appreciates good music.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This CD was different from her previos, CD - it's just as good though.  A beautiful voice combined with excellent music.
0316921173|1.0|Infinite Jest reads like a math textbook, and I question my sanity for pressing through till the end. The plot, if that's what we're to call it, is motionless. The characters are as sterile and flavorless as hyperbolic topological expressions -- it's not exactly that they are flat or dimensionless, they're just dull. Wallace inexplicably includes mathematical equations as part of the text, rather than in the footnotes ( ! Too full with the real plot events already?), and these equations are either simplistic or just wrong. Perhaps the nicest thing I could say is that all this is intentional, an attempt to match the style to the central theme of addiction, and if this is the case, Wallace's succeeded brilliantly: this book has all the coherence of the verbiose ravings of a strung-out cocaine addict. If you want verbiage as well as a decent read, I'd suggest Pynchon, Gaddis, or Eco.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This may be one of the best reissues in the history of Columbia Records. If you have the previous CD pressing of &quot;Live at Folsom Prison,&quot; you owe it to yourself to get the   unexperguated version.   Johnny Cash's greatest recording ever is improved by the remastered sound, off-color jokes, and the inclusion of missing songs (although when you hear his take on &quot;Busted,&quot; &quot;Joe Bean&quot; and &quot;Legend of John Henry's Hammer,&quot; you kind of understand why they were excised to begin with). Cash's original liner notes are included, along with new reflections by Steve Earle. <br />The redo of &quot;At San Quentin&quot; is similarly commendable. (In fact, that restoration may be even more remarkable, since the original &quot;At San Quentin&quot; was badly botched.) Here's hoping Columbia will soon reissue other missing Cash classics, like &quot;Hello I'm Johnny Cash,&quot; &quot;A Thing Called Love,&quot; &quot;Any Old Wind that Blows&quot; and &quot;Ragged Old Flag.&quot;
B00000JPYD|4.0|Trower, Reg Isidore and James are in top notch form here, delivering some of the best rock music ever recorded in the nineties. The extra-tracks here are nosense. I prefer they be inedit tracks, something like this, than live version of the same original songs of the  CD. Other than this, this album is pertect.
B000002G7E|5.0|i heard her call my name is cool
B00005KHJM|3.0|I looked forward to the Wicker Man but was somewhat<BR>disappoited. I is hardly a &quot;serious thriller&quot; and does not<BR>have the suspense of old Hammer productions. With a few<BR>scenes deleted it could probably get a PG rating. It would<BR>have been controversial had it been released in the 1940's<BR>or 50's but a Bible-quoting policeman investigating a<BR>crime on an island with nude pagans is really corny in<BR>our modern society of secular and jaded cinics.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|As a film, Memento is loads of fun, but from the description above it sounds like the DVD doesn't have a lot of bonus features. I was so hoping the disc would come with the ability to play scenes in chronological order once you'd watched it through once or twice correctly.
B000002BFZ|5.0|While it's not quite the dark epxerience of Vitalogy, No Code continues Pearl Jam's maturation into the clever, subtle and complex songs which pepper the CD. Certainly, there's no clearly delineated &quot;theme&quot; on this album, it's an aural cornucopia which is visually demostrated by the album cover; a seemingly random collection of polaroids focusing on different aspects of the world.<BR> &quot;Sometimes&quot; is a quiet, simple song which leads abruptly into the raw energy of &quot;Hail Hail&quot;. &quot;Who You Are&quot;, &quot;In My Tree&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; are hypnotic and mid-tempo which build perfectly into one of the highlights of the album in &quot;There He Goes&quot;, a beautifully sad song about friendship. &quot;Habit&quot;, &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; and &quot;Lukin&quot; are in stark contrast; hard, guitar-driven and full-blooded. &quot;Present Tense&quot; is another moody, quiet track and &quot;Mankind&quot;, more of a straightforward rock song, allows Stone to exercise his vocal chords and &quot;I'm Open&quot; is a chillingly melancholy spoken word pseudo-experiment which works well.<BR> So that's No Code in a nutshell; 13 beautiful tracks, each completely different from the last and tracing a variety of different emotions and experiences. It's also a testiment to the deep talent and broad range of Pearl Jam. <BR> You know what I believe is one of the greatest assets of Pearl Jam? It's their profound ability to alienate masses of so-called &quot;Die Hard Fans&quot; by being constantly dynamic, stretching their talent and imagination and flexing their creative muscle instead of churning out &quot;Alive&quot; after &quot;Alive&quot;. If you resent what Pearl Jam have become since Vitalogy: great, we don't want you. Block you ears, lock yourself in your room and put Ten on repeat. Come back out when you've opened your mind. As Eddie would eloquently sum up in Yield... It's Evolution, Baby!
B00003CXSP|5.0|I know that there are many people out there that didn't like the movie. Many people loved Manhunter and silence of the Lambs because it was a suspense. There was very little bloody scenes in those movies, Hannibal has more. Hannibal is just keeping up with the times. Many more people are going to movies to see Horror films. It was an excellently made film. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. But, if you get squeamish at Horror movies, maybe this isn't for you. But, for people like me, It was an excellent movie, and I recommend it to all of my friends.
B000028U0Y|1.0|I hated it but I already knew that I bought it for my husband who is in love with it.  the songs are all about dying and jail time and one about killing a Dog  for easting eggs.  But hey it is old fashioned country.
0393316041|5.0|Enjoyable, Hard to put down. The chapter on Altered States was only so so.
B00000JGHM|5.0|&quot;Heat&quot; is without a doubt the finest movie ever made. Getting a chance to watch the two best actors go head to head is great, as well as rare. The coffee shop scence is almost classic. The shootout after the bank heist is the best shootout of all time. As well as one of the best action scences ever filmed. The film also features a great supporting cast.The music also gives the film another touch of greatness. Keep in mind this is not an action movie such as a Die Hard or a Lethal Weapon. It is a crime drama at it's best. But the action will blow you away. You might just break your rewind button for the shootout scence.
B00005NW02|5.0|This album is the most amazing hard rock I have heard in years. System Of A Down has put together an Album better that the first. If you like the first album you will love Toxicity. I can listen to the whole CD over and over again if you like hard rock... This is a must buy.
1558908420|3.0|This was a good movie, fun to watch but hard to follow due to a great many plot inconsistancies.  It's a little hard to take seriously a murder conspiracy where every member insists on having shouting matching detailing their plot in very public places.  One cop who's death has been faked, wanders around town and attends parties with no concern of anyone realizing he's alive.  When the fantasticaly poorly conspired plan starts to unravel, these supposedly trained investigators decide to fall back on a daylight kidnapping and murder, right in front of the local Sheriff, whom they know is not on their side.<br />Stalone gave a fantastic performance as an underachieving cop who has been content to be walked on by &quot;the big boys&quot; until the conspiracy unfolds.  Worth watching if your a cop movie buff, but don't get too wrapped in the story.
B00005KHJR|5.0|Don't be *warned* or thwarted by these 103 minute spoiled sports.<BR>I am a HUGE fan of this film and have it on audio cassette, audio<BR>CD, VHS (the Magnum full version), and now I have the DVD LE set.<br />I got chills when I viewed the Theatrical 84 minute version!<BR>It contained little bits that I've never seen! Too cool!<br />The Extended version is utterly the same as the Magnum VHS<BR>version release. I notice very little difference.<br />What really excited me was the incredible interview footage.<br />I learned a lot about this film that I never knew.<br />If anybody is telling you to NOT buy this because it lacks<BR>footage, then the truth (right from the directors mouth) is<BR>that the footage they are looking for does NOT exist.<BR>Otherwise, I think it'd have been released within, oh, the past<BR>thirty years at some point.<br />I also love the neat little box it came in.<br />&quot;True&quot; fans will appreciate the gorgeous quality.

B000009O8A|4.0|When movies first came out on video there were two legendary exploitation films I had to track down. One was &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; and the other was &quot;I Spit on Your Grave,&quot; which is actually the more memorable film of the pair overall (although I do grant the highest place to the &quot;hook&quot; scene in TCM). Director Meir Zarchi's 1978 film has become rather infamous, since critics hated it, audiences were outraged, and the film was banned in Germany and Great Britain. The story, such as it is, finds Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton, Buster's grand-niece) out in the woods of Connecticut to work on a novel when she crosses the path of some local boys who decide she should be the first sexual partner for their mentally-disabled friend. When he cannot complete the rape, his friends do it for him. Then they decide that they are not done with Jennifer.<br />At issue are not Jennifer's specific acts of revenge, including the infamous bathroom scene, but rather the series of brutal rapes that precede them. I do not want to meet anyone who is not disturbed by these rape scenes and I think it is fairly obvious that Zarchi intended to make audiences uncomfortable. In retrospect you have to wonder about all those movies with rape scenes that do NOT upset the audience. But Zarchi certainly pours it on thick, absolutely assuring that things go beyond the tolerance level of anyone who watches this film. So the bottom line is that this film will upset you and it is therefore effective at doing exactly what it wants to do, which is supposed to be a good thing, right? I have always considered this an &quot;X&quot; rated movie although I would not consider it pornographic in the traditional sense. But it is a very disturbing film and I do not think I would want my kids to see it until after they graduate college (if ever). Anyone renting this film for cheap thrills is in for a shock.<br />As I now understand it, this 1978 film was originally released as &quot;Day of the Woman,&quot; but that rather innocuous title was replaced by the well known &quot;I Spit on Your Grave,&quot; although the film was also screened as &quot;I Hate Your Guts&quot; and &quot;The Rape and Revenge of Jennifer Hill.&quot; All of this is interesting since it seems the producers were trying to pass off this film with both higher and lover levels of pretention. Beyond being letterboxed, this DVD offers nothing than the cheesy original theatrical trailer. But this is one film where you would certainly like to have to hear what the director has to say.uot;Day of the Woman,&quot; but that rather innocuous title was replaced by the well known &quot;I Spit on Your Grave,&quot; although the film was also screened as &quot;I Hate Your Guts&quot; and &quot;The Rape and Revenge of Jennifer Hill.&quot; All of this is interesting since it seems the producers were trying to pass off this film with both higher and lover levels of pretention.

0887309372|4.0|This book is highly recommended for anyone trying to build a brand strategy. It may be a bit much to call these &quot;laws&quot;. They seem more like &quot;guidelines&quot;. While evidence is given, it's in the anecdotal category, and dubious scientific cause-and-effect hypotheses are fronted.<br />While I buy the theme of not diluting the brand with line extensions, and have watch products in my own companies suffer similar results, I have to raise an eyebrow at the notion that Diet Coke should have been shelved in honor of &quot;Tab.&quot; I do agree however that Taco Bell and Boston Market grocery-store-freezer brands are line extensions that should have gotten someone fired.<br />In summary, this is a quick read that makes you think, but it won't make you a brand-master overnight.
B00003CXSP|4.0|We have gotten to the point with DVDs where we really need to be able to rating both the film AND the packaging (similar to what we get to do with the THREE rating categories for toys), because whatever you might think about &quot;Hannibal&quot; as a film this is an excellent 2-disc DVD package.  Director Ridley Scott's commentary is first rate, although there are more lengthy pauses in the last act of the film (and I cannot get the subtitles to work during the commentary, which is how I prefer to do it).  The best of the extras is probably the bit on the Fish Market shootout that allows you to look simultaneously at the multi-camera angles used to film the scenes.  The &quot;making of&quot; featurette is okay, the cast bios above average, and the dozens of discarded examples of posters for the film are fascinating.<br />I think we are all pretty much in agreement that the shortcomings with the film version of &quot;Hannibal&quot; are inherent in Thomas Harris's novel.  The main problem is that when Hannibal is &quot;out&quot; he is simply not as powerful a figure.  The potency of the character in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is that even when he was thrown in a dungeon cell or masked and harnessed to a dolly he was still in psychological control of the situation.  The idea of Hannibal getting Meigs to swallow his tongue was more horrific than what happened to Pazzi or Krendler in this film.  I am sure the ending of the film has to be more satisfying to fans than that of the novel, although I do want to point out that in the book Lecter used drugs and psychological conditioning to reprogram Clarice into not his lover but rather his consort, which is closer to Frankenstein than Pygmalion.<br />Watching &quot;Hannibal&quot; on DVD confirmed the two strengths I found in the film when I first saw it in the theater.  First, screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian did a marvelous job of concocting scenes between Hannibal and Clarice.  In the novel the two are never together until the very end, while in the screenplay we have Clarice listening to tapes of their previous conversations and talking on the telephone in a couple of interesting situations.  Without these creative additions &quot;Hannibal&quot; becomes just like &quot;Sleepless in Seattle.&quot;  Second, the best performance in the film is turned in by Julianne Moore.  We have no trouble believing this is Clarice Starling ten years down the road.  Of course this is particularly impressive since the actress is following in the footsteps of Jodie Foster's Oscar winning performance.  I even think you can clearly see echoes of Foster's original characterization in Moore's work.  As for Anthony Hopkins, he is certainly presenting a different, more mellow side to Hannibal, which I suppose is justified by the intervening years.  Still, as the ending amply proves, this is not the same old Hannibal Lecter.<br />Anyhow, whether you have already seen &quot;Hannibal&quot; or not, as long as you have seen &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; you should check out the DVD version and make up your mind about all these nonsense.  You have to admit the author and the film give you plenty to think about.are never together until the very end, while in the screenplay we have Clarice listening to tapes of their previous conversations and talking on the telephone in a couple of interesting situations.

B00005JKHP|4.0|Great movie! I know many people, even the fans, still don't like this movie because it is so slow, but I think of all the Star Trek movies, this is the most artistic. It isn't, I would say, a pure Star Trek story, since it is so much more focused on film-making than it is on story. Watch this film, and you will see many of the artistic film styles that Kubrick sought in 2001 - very slow camera movement, ships moving slowly through space, long minutes of visuals focused on one thing. Even the sound of the movie has the real quiet, real slow quality of the film-work. It's a beautifully rendered movie, and a pretty neat story, though not what it could have been. The character's Decker and Alya were, I feel, a bit too contrived to fit so perfectly in the story. Love the ending, though - great unexpected surprise twist to V'ger, which I will not give out here.<br />Artistically, musically, cinematographically, this is my favorite Star Trek film. Story-wise, it is not as exciting or pure Star-Trek as Star Trek II or Star Trek IV, but like all the movies, it is still a compelling and interesting story.<br />I am glad to see that Paramount is finally being generous to its army of Trek fans who pour so much money into their coffers, and are offering what appears to be a VERY loaded DVD version!
B00004WEJZ|2.0|I never thought i would say this but i am sorry to have seen this particular movie made. Whilst Sean Connery turns in a good performance the rest of the cast and indeed the plot leaves something to be desired in their performance and indeed their standard and it is well apparant that the usual Bond Team was not involved in the production of this movie. If your a Bond fan then maybe give it a look - otherwise give it a miss.
B00004TFK3|4.0|I am admitting here that I did not see this movie in the theater, and only recently rented it to watch on a small TV.  However, even on a small screen without full-blown multi-track sound, I still loved it!  This is a brilliantly executed movie, with clever dialogue, some wonderful story line, and great acting by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith both.  Jones is absolutely perfect at being the completely unflappable straight-laced professional dealing with the most bizarre things - space aliens, shape changers, tentacled aliens giving birth - and makes a great dramatic counterpart to Will Smith's very excellent acting of the freaked-out character seeing all the weirdness for the first time.  This is a great, farcical romp with a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, some great special effects, and very clever alien design and situations (such as the scene in which Will Smith is in the background, helping an alien give birth in a car, and being bounced all over and thrown around by the alien's giant tentacle, while Jones is discussing space travel permissions with the male alien in the foreground of the scene).  It's also a good film for the family, without sex and very little dirty language.  I can see the kids loving this for the cool aliens, the surprise situations, much of the humor, and the over-the-top bad guy scene at the end.  I would not hesitate at all to show this film to children.<br />The DVD is chock-full of goodies, too, including a very fun \\"edit your own scene\\" part.  The commentary is quiet good, and the making of Men In Black is also very interesting and informative<br />This is a very, very fun movie for an evening of light-but-good entertainment, along the lines of Ghostbusters or Cannonball Run.  It's not real high on a literary or artistic scale, though it is not inartistic - it's just not on a par with an Orson Welles film, or Howard's End, etc. It is also not quite a \\"watch it over-and-over\\" film that I would need to have on DVD - the novelty of the story, while I enjoyed it immensely, isn't quite riveting enough to watch it frequently, in the way that Ghostbusters is.  I would be satisfied simply to have the cheaper video. However, the extras on the DVD make it absolutely worth the price if you are a big fan of this movie, or a fan of overloaded DVDs. I give it four stars for movie quality, and 5 stars for the overloaded features of the DVD.ory, while I enjoyed it immensely, isn't quite riveting enough to watch it frequently, in the way that Ghostbusters is.

B00000AFDW|4.0|Even though Kiss is my favorite band, I didn't really like this album on the first listen. However, it definitely gets better every time I listen to it. There are some problems with this record though. I was expecting the &quot;classic&quot; Kiss sound, but Ace &amp; Peter seem to have been pushed to the background. Can't Peter do anything other than a love ballad? I guess they waited too long to reunite, because nobody bought this album. Do you think that Paul &amp; Gene would be retiring if this album sold by the millions? The novelty of the reunion has worn off! Thanks for the memories!!
B00005BL2A|4.0|This CD is a breath from the past, with an updated feel.  If you loved Violator, then you'll like Exciter.  A great shot at redemption from their more recent attempts to modernize DM's music.  It hasn't yet landed on my &quot;All time best CD's&quot; list, but is avery strong album that compliments any DM collection.
079075116X|4.0|Great movie,hope to soon be released in dvd.
B00005LMBK|3.0|This being the &quot;first&quot; CD from the Gorillaz makes wonder.  The Album is pretty good overall - each track is a completely different music style than the previous.  There are songs on here that harken memories of Blur Song 2, and some gansta rap, to trance style.  <br />To me, it sounds like an artificial band put together by a group of producers - kinda like Kid Rock - all marketing and very little substance. The music is good, and the CD doesn't contain any surprises.  Very good for background music.  There are some catchy tunes - namely &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; which has recently been picked up by MTV.<br />If you got the cash, it wont damage anything.  <br />Note: the CD is embeded with a data section - insert it into a PC and it pops up wanting to load a &quot;key&quot; to access the bands website.  Very annoying.  With the inclusion of the data track, it renders the CD unplayable in my computer - where I listen to most of my CDs.  There is no useful or entertaining value to this added &quot;bonus&quot;
0060916540|3.0|Given the plethora of reviews of this slender tale that gush with praise, my thoughts about this story are clearly contrarian. Actually, no amount of praise would be enough to describe Joe Simpson's courage, determination and strength in surviving seemingly insurmountable odds, while suffering tormenting pain, after plunging from a vertical face of a 21,000 foot peak in the Andes. However, my appreciation for this tale was marred by nagging questions about how Simpson ended up in his nasty predicament in the first place. Given the objective technical risks of the chosen route, wouldn't it have been wise to have a third member on the rope team? With several near misses along the chosen summit and descent routes before the &quot;final&quot; disaster, would &quot;tempting fate&quot; (one of the chapters in the book) be a better name for the book? Was achieving a first ascent more important than making a successful descent? The tale infers Simpson's partner was unsettled about leaving base camp, so why didn't he try harder to confirm his assumption that Simpson had died before making a decision to leave the area? I would be first in line to hear Simpson teach a lesson on courage, but I would think twice before taking a lesson on mountaineering from these guys. Moreover, the substance of this tale seems better suited to a short story or magazine article than a book.
B00001O2WQ|5.0|Mark Free's Long Way From Love is an absolute masterpiece released in 1992. Mark Free is known as a legendary King Kobra vocalist who also made another rock masterpiece Loud and Clear when he was with Signal in 1989.<br />The album shows Starship or Heart styled excellent pop rock. My favorite is Hard Heart To Break remnicent a bit of Starship's It's Not Enough. Only lucky Starship, Survivor, Two Fires, Heart and Hugo fans may get this rare CD. Act it quick!
0679746048|2.0|I have had a similar experience to Kaysen. After about twenty minutes interview (though I have not checked recently) a professional who did not know me decided to have me put in McLean, the same institution as Kaysen. At 18. The same age of Kaysen.<br />There I had some very bad experiences. I don't believe I should ever have spent any time there. I don't have time to detail them all but I had very hurtful experiences. They diagnosed me with some iffy psychiatric diagnoses out of the current version of the DSM and also with a neurological syndrome which I do have. <br />They never explained or told me about the neurological syndrome. (I choose to use the language they use.) Apparently I could not learn from or help myself in knowing that I had it. So they kept this to themselves.<br />Her commitment happened in the late 1960's. The book says that she began to write it circa 1990. (Unless she had taken notes earlier.) She managed to compress two years of experience into a novella-length story. In the space of twenty-plus years you lose some memories and bad memories do tend to fade with time. <br />I think Kaysen can write well but also over-writes though. She lyricizes her own experiences. Prettifies them. She criticizes psychiatry and at the same time seems to accept it. She accepts herself as mad. I don't accept this experience as a spiritual journey or a chemical imbalance or anything except a judgment made by other people and judgment made about the self.<br />&quot;Victims. Therapy. Borderline personality disorder. &quot;<br />Enough. No more.  Away with them.
B000001DTM|5.0|&quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is definitely U2's best work of late.

This is a marvelous piece of work by a talented group.

B000021YQV|5.0|for this album! I must say this is an awesome album from SOAD. Although I've heard how great this was going to be it certainly exceeded my expectations! With 14 tracks in all, its great all the way through with a great blend of hardcore and melodic tunes much to the credit of the emotional vocals from singer Serj. I definitely recommend this anyone! Go buy it now!
B000002P2V|5.0|Recording techniques improved dramatically every year since the 1880s, peaking about 1978. Subtle improvements have been made since then. Unfortunately, like many albums that remained popular into the 1980s, the first CDs were hasty transfers--they sounded flatter and cleaner, that's all. Finally, we have Who Are You in all its atmospheric, explosive, gyrating, rasping glory. It is a desperate album: The Who barely made it to 1978 to put its dying words on tape then expire for all practical purposes. It's amazing that no rock and roller has ever done anything worthwhile after his early thirties; none probably ever will. Thank God for this album. And thank God for the additional tracks: Empty Glass with John Entwistle and Keith Moon just &quot;going off&quot; over Pete Townshend's prerecorded vocals and guitar, a more passionate Guitar and Pen, and Who Are You with a substituted stanza that in some ways crystallizes the desperation that lay just behind the album but which Pete Townshend obviously had mixed feelings about revealing under the name The Who. Any rock fan who does not buy this album is missing something.
B00005NW02|5.0|This album is a bit heavier than the first one, i liked the first more, because it changes pace a bit more. but over all it's a great cd, and if you enjoyed system of a down's self titled album then this is definitely worth buying!
B00005NW02|5.0|I bought Toxicity yesterday, after looking around for what felt like forever! Finally, I got it and I don't regret it. SOAD has evolved and has formed their own sound from all the other bands out there. Anyone could figure that out from there first CD but in their second, they have controled and harnessed their sound. The album is one of those where I never have to skip a song. A note on younger people: if your parents won't let you buy this CD because of the parental advisory sticker, then by the non-limited edition CD. All you're missing is the extra CD that has a long video that's alright.<BR>Prison Song--this song really makes you think. The only song on the whole CD that contains any swearing.<BR>Needles--a very hard driven and makes a point and leaves you with a strange feeling. I had to play this song a few times before I fully got its messege.<BR>Deer Dance--all the songs on this CD, except 9, are hard. I'm not sure how to explain this one.<BR>Jet Pilot--hummm...but good.<BR>X--this song contains a really good messege. Some may not agree with me.<BR>Chop Suey!--this song is curently my favorite, probably because I've been hearing it on the radio for about a month.<BR>Bounce--this song has a lot of humor and a messege that I find refreshing.<BR>Forest--another good hard one.<BR>ATWA--one of my favorites. This song reminds me of Spiders.<BR>Shimmy--another one of my favorites.<BR>Toxicity--the cover song. Once again, this one is also good.<BR>Psycho--this song is the only song that I don't like as much as the other ones. For one thing, it's under 2 minutes.<BR>Aerials--I love the ending of this song! It finishes the album nicely.
0790729342|4.0|Of the three Mad Max movies, this the middle installment, is my favorite. Great action combined with appropriate costumes and the use of the outback terrain for location filming accentuates the continuation of the Mad Max saga.While Mel Gibson grew sick and tired of filming in adverse conditions such as this and \\"Thunderdome\\", it is these movies vs. the cheesy more mainstream Lethal Weapon flicks that Gibson's fans will look back upon with fondness.
0688170528|5.0|Jodi Picoult has written a beautiful love story, chocked full of emotion. I was involved with the characters from the very beginning. From the very first paragraph, I was on an emotional rollercoaster. This novel not only painted a wonderful love story, it also demonstrates how difficult sometimes it is to be a parent, wanting only the best for your children. I could not put this book down and I demonstrated this by finishing this in record time. I had never heard of this author before, but you can bet I will be reading more of her.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is just a great movie. If you are intelligent and open minded you will love it. Fight Club is a little crude at times, but any adult should be able to see through the violent exterior and understand that the message of the movie is not to go destroy things. If you are unable to do this, you will probably hate the movie. I won't bother talking about the story, just buy the movie and enjoy. This DVD also features many bonuses, which you can view by looking at the description above. This is the best movie of the 90's, don't miss out.
B000008H1U|5.0|Many reviews of CoaK seem to express a view I share. This is a terrific, melodic, and controlled album in which Anderson constrains himself within a very narrow commercial rock genre - while showing his usual brilliant variations on it. Apart from the overlong end to Budapest, it is pretty hard to fault the core tracks (I don't think that Raising Steam is up to the rest of the album and is rightly a late appendage). Mountain Men and Jump Start are about perfect. These are just superbly constructed and balanced pop objects; they refer across to Dire Straits and ZZ Top but are as close to them as Henri Rousseau is to naive art. By the way, I think it is this artificial quality (in the best sense of artifice) to Anderson's work that puts so many people off. Rock musicians and audiences are normally full of aspiration to authenticity; Anderson has always struck me, thankfully, as wholly conventional, musically and mostly lyrically too.<BR>There is something I disagree with in some other reviews of the lyrics on the album which tend to personalize and banalize the words. The lyrical treatment of East European communist societies is historically very insightful. 'She was the nearest thing to rock and roll, this side of the velvet curtain that separates Eastern steel from Western gold.'; apart from the gratuitous slight (why isn't she 'rock and roll' - think of how important rock music was to that generation of Russians as a source of connection to the world), the line neatly anticipates the 'velvet revolution' and gets so well at the cultural gap between East and West that developed in the 1980s. Budapest is also highly prescient for 1987 (or 1986 when he wrote it). The song is a brilliant poetical expression of the fall of communism and its causes. Anderson has the sense, before most others did, that things are hotting up socially and politically in Budapest and that the restrictions on advancement are about to collapse. From running round in circles as the best means ofescape (internal exile or cooptation within the ruling circle), the young woman who could have been a 'budding stately hero' is about to run straight at last, and for her own sake, to the Westlands. She is not, or not yet at that point in history, a prostitute, either to the Western band or to the communist government but a kind of elemental force. It would be interesting but less romantic to see Anderson follow her into the post-communist period. Maybe on the next album?

B00005NW02|5.0|I just got into System of a Down after hearing a song on the radio.  So I thought I'd check em out and bought this cd and its amazing.  The guitars and unique vocals make for a great sound.  This cd is a great buy and worth your money
B000006NPY|5.0|The name of the second single off this disc is the apt title for my review as well.  I know many Pumpkins fans disliked this album, and rated it as one of their least favorite.  I can understand their sentiments, as this album was quite a departure from Gish and Siamese Dream.  Traces of a similar music style were shown in Melancholy, but too far and few between, meshed between numerous songs that shouldn't have been released.<br />Overall, this is my favorite Pumpkins album, followed by Siamese Dream, Machina (believe it or not), Melancholy, Pisces Iscariot, and Gish.  In fact it is one of my favorite CD's (out of about 400), and I always seem to come back to it.  Why, you ask?  Let me state the reasons.<br />First, this is THE most emotional album that the Pumpkins ever put out.  Billy Corgan managed to dig into his soul, past the rage that covered up his insecurities, and get to the heart of all of his feelings.<br />The number of weak songs on this album are few.  In fact, many of my favorite tunes can be found here.  Between &quot;Perfect&quot;, &quot;Daphne Descends&quot;, &quot;Crestfallen, &quot;Apples &amp; Oranges&quot;, and my personal favorite, &quot;Behold! The Nightmare&quot;, there are many songs whose beauty will stick with you all day.<br />I love listening to this album at night.  Although it puts me to sleep at times, it is so relaxing and soothing that I would recommend it to everybody.  It is unfortunate that the Pumpkins broke up...they will be missed by many for masterpieces such as &quot;Adore&quot;.
B00005NW02|5.0|This album rules. Since the last release, &quot;System of a Down&quot;, the group has been touring alot, and Terj, the lead singer, has developed greatly. All the tracks are excellent, especially Chop Suey! and Aerials. The bonus CD-Rom has some great features for any big fan.
2080704753|4.0|Marcel PROUST (1871-1922) through his 'RESEARCH OF THE TIMES LOST'(published l913-27) carries us to a mental paradise. Analysis of the sub-conscious is the main characteristic of this fictionised reminiscence, for which the author has used long complex sentences. Otherwise the human characters involved and their situations are described vividly.<br />&quot;DU COTE'DE CHEZ SWANN&quot; is the first book of this long series. It is based on romance of the COMBRAY of his young age,in which the innocent sensibility of a child is mellowed with the craving sensuality of the adolescent.A number of interesting characters emerge with their contradictions, cruelty, hypocrisy, snobism, irony and mind conditioning. The first book is the best book.<br />AUNT LEONI enjoys her last days within confines of the bed room. She keeps abreast with the street life through direct window observations supplemented by more informations FRANCOISE and EUTALIE bring. She receives only those friends who know what to tell her but, amusingly, she cannot prevent the priest from droping in and tiring her from his disenchanting show of knowledge.<br />Family member, kitchen chief, and Personal Secretary to AUNT, FRANCOISE, could not be a less personality, offering from matured life experience 'expert' opinion on many a matter. She respects the time table and wishes of her Mistress in minute details, all the time preparing for the imminent change of command to the narrator's mother. From the long association, Aunt and Francoise know ins and outs of each other's psyche.Aunt on occasions to herself detests FRANCOISE astoundingly,while the latter grudges any small gift the former gives to poor and deformed Eutalie. Francoise shows great affectation on human suffering in abstraction, but derives sadistic pleasure from it under her eyes. She would cause every possible affliction to the kitchen girl - pregnant, in travail or allergic - till she runs away vacating place for Francoise daughter.<br />An unorthodox M. SWANN is family friend with property in the neighborhood. Often he dines in the house and brings presents as requested or by himself.When he comes,the dinner is prolonged to late night hours and the boy narrator misses the sweet good-night kiss of his mother. The stream-of-consciousness description of the unique night he could retain Mother in his bed-room is breath-taking; it motivated writing this book and the series.<br />Mother reads out from the book for the boy Proust and with what an elegance: 'Sentences seemed written for her tender and melancholy voice...She infused into the prose a continuous sentimental life!<br />Parents take the boy to evening walks either to the side of Swann's property, or towards that of GUERMANTES duchy. These provide the first two subtitles of the Proust's  &quot;Research&quot;. <br />One evening, he returns tired of a long walk. Then at the very sight of the familiar backyard, &quot;the ground moves for him in that garden without he having to take a single step forward&quot;.<br />The lunch hour is advanced on Saturdays by one hour for Francoise's sake. It impresses all afternoon activities up to heavens: &quot;After the lunch, even the sky appears to have changed face; the sun, conscious of it being Saturday, loiters one hour more on celestial heights&quot;.<br />As the book advances, Swann's image grows slowly and steadily till, in the second part, he is the hero. A non-conformist to the social prejudices of his time and class, humble, kind, considerate, lover of music, literature and women, Proust acclaims him in these words: &quot;Swann of the charming errors of my youth, our life, musium of his time's all familiar portraits, full of leisure and perfumed by all the best of nature&quot;.<br />M. VINTEUIL gave lessons of piano to Aunt Leoni in her early age, and hoped to edit a day his original compositions retained more in memory than in writing. His daughter comes under the influence of a known lesbian and the affectionate father, for her sake, tolerates the woman under his own roofs. Vinteul has been very severe to youngsters for a least misdemeanor,and after this humiliation too, remained a proud fault-finder for others. He dies, however, soon crushed and suffocated. His daughter loved and respected him, but under the spell of carnal pleasure, swallowed all insult the woman inflicted on the old man living or dead.<br />M. LEGRANDIN is a writer. When at Combray, he showers the young narrator with poetic kindness: &quot;May the heavens be ever blue on your life, my young friend...be careful to keep some open sky on you...All the ear can hear now is the moonlight music on the<BR>flute of silence!&quot;<BR>On the litmus of personal experience, however, he turns out to be only an erudit miser who, with empty words &quot;could build a castle of ethics and a universe of geography without admitting a word of truth&quot; which would benefit a friend.<br />It is unforgetable to read how a small event like tasting a tea-soaked piece of cake triggered, in narrator's memory, that vivid emergence of the long forgotten Combray. Remember the church tower of Sainte HILLAIRE, omnipresent in the town. It haunts PROUST henceforth wherever he goes as a symbol of something exquisite and intimately his. &quot;I turned into a street, still looking for my way...but..it was in my heart!&quot;<br />Proust's prose abounds in beautiful expressions as already quoted and as in this praise of BERGOTTE: &quot;With confidence and joy I wept on the writer's page as if in the arms of a rediscovered father&quot;,<BR>and thoughtful socio-psychological observations as<BR> &quot;Our social personality is a creation of others' thought. Even the simple act of seeing a person is partly an intellectual act.&quot;<br />The world of Proust is vast and deep. We can touch his soul and meet his Muse only under infinite peace of mind.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Words can not describe how amazing this band is. They are the most brutal, insane metal act I have ever heard. But they are not just tough, they are amazingly talented songwriters and lyricists. Jacob Bannon has the most death rattling scream, one capable of inducing heart failure in the elderly and possible bowel leakage in anyone of any age. Anyone who is either a fan of Hardcore metal or simply of musicians at the top of their field, you must own this album. It is the best release by Converge, which is impressive considering how good their other albums and split EPs are. Converge makes Slipknot look like trick or treaters. No major record label can ever contain this sound, and that's the way it should always be.
B00003CXSM|1.0|This movie was garbage. Placing a well-mixed martini atop the DVD on your coffee table will provide far more entertainment than this movie, even if you are spending your evening completely alone.  I'd like to say the script was terrible, but, to be honest, I don't think there was a script.  Lopez and McConaughey, two people with at least some talent, never had a chance in this film.  If I had to allow this movie one saving grace it would have to be Justin Chambers as the puppy-lovesick Mossimo, but even he was sadly underserved by this sadly underwritten script.
078401213X|1.0|Pi, director Darren Aronofsky's first feature film, is about an obsessed mathematician, Maximilian Cohen (Sean Gullette), and his search for a numerical code that is supposed to predict the stock market.<br />This film is not for everyone. Usually, when I begin a review with these words, glowing praise will follow. Not this time. This film is not for everyone--in fact it is only for people who see depth where there isn't any. Pi is not a deep, thought-provoking film. It won't cause you to re-think humanity or anything, unless you happen to be on drugs while watching. It's basically about a guy who has constant muscle spasms and shouts &quot;NO!!&quot; over and over.<br />As a drama, this movie fails. As hard sci-fi, it's laughable, but as a dark comedy, it has some potential. Gullette's performance of an obsessive techie-type is supposed to be intense and philosophical. As an obsessive techie-type myself, I find his performance to be more like a sarcastic in-joke: as if he's saying, &quot;Look how ridiculous you nerds can be!&quot; If you can get past the unresearched pseudo-math and the repetative narration, you'll start to see a film that laughs at science--and scientists who think they can sum the universe up with a few formulas.<br />Sadly I don't think comedy was Aronofsky's intent. We viewers are actually supposed to find deep meaning in Pi. Unfortunately, it takes more than a depiction of inner-turmoil to make a compelling drama.<br />For a $600,000 production, Pi is well done. Its musical score is edgy and creative, and the film is shot cleverly--not over-artsy. The DVD has a lot of extras, putting many big-budget films to shame.<br />Rating: *<br />Over-acted science fiction that's not grounded in real science.
B00005221M|3.0|I, like the other reviewers, loved this movie in the theater and on video.  It was wonderful and I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD! Alas, I was disappointed greatly in the Director's Expanded Version.  They muted down the Irish music during the love scene, and totally cut out the singing during the captives walk (even though they included that song in the credits).  I didn't really notice any outstanding &quot;expanded scenes.&quot;  But I did notice the quip that Hawkeye gave the Major (on the lake with the pistol pointing at him) was cut out.  To me, that quip showed how well Hawkeye could still face adversities and strife.  I would much rather have had a DVD of this movie with behind-the-scenes interviews and deleted scenes (like the love scene between Uncas and Alice under the waterfall).  I would have loved a double love storyline!  It would have made their end much more intense.<br />Overall, it's still a good movie, but I'm probably going to get rid of my DVD.  I would buy another one if they came out with a better DVD version with more options.
0345350499|3.0|Undeniably well-written and perhaps the most easily digestible long book I've ever read, Bradley's extremely popular and widely influential feminist take on the Arthurian legend is nonetheless a difficult book for me to recommend. Despite its considerable literary merits, &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; is badly flawed by the author's own questionable philosophical agenda, particularly as regards her evident mistrust and/or misunderstanding of Christianity. None of the Christians in the novel are admirable or even likeable, and the Church as a whole is too often portrayed as a bastion of intolerance and ignorance. Though some of the book's characters occasionally announce that it is not Christ Himself they fear, but merely His overzealous followers, it's just too little too late. On a more purely literary plane, Bradley further errs by casting Morgan le Fay as her main protagonist. Despite all the love Bradley can lavish on her &quot;heroine,&quot; the Priestess of Avalon still never comes across to me as anything more than a venomous spider at the heart of a very dark and vast web. Moreover, the book is rather repetitive, relying chapter-to-chapter on many recurring set pieces and devices, a weakness common to most lengthy novels. Finally, by telling the Arthurian story from the viewpoint of the largely non-combatant females, many of the elements that most appeal to large numbers of Arthurian fans (epic battles, tests of bravery and chivalry, etc.) are simply glossed over in passing, robbing the tale of much of its inherent grandeur. Even so, &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; manages to be largely entertaining and is clearly more than thoroughly researched. Liberals and especially New Agers will probably consider this a genuine masterpiece. Conservatives, particularly orthodox Christians, may find certain elements disagreeable, and might consider the recent TNT-produced movie more palatable. It's certainly more exciting, less dogmatic, and generally a little more instep with traditional Arthurian interpretations than its source novel.
B00003CXSP|1.0|Save your money!<br />Boring, blood, gut's, and no real plot.<br />I thought Gladiator was great!<br />Alien was great, but the director failed<br />in this.<br />Good try Mr. Scott, but you did not get my money!
B00000IAU3|4.0|This album was not what I expected from all they hype that came out when it was released.  When I first listened to it I was not sure what to think and was honestly a bit dissapointed.  However, after listening to it a second and then a third time it grew on me.  Now it is one that I reach for fairly often.  If you got it and are upset it isn't what you thought it would be try listening to it again, it might help.  ;)
0743517849|4.0|I'll add this to the fray only because I haven't seen my particular viewpoint expressed yet.<br />The gist of this book (not necessarily the statistics) was a real eye-opener for me. I was groomed and encouraged to pursue &quot;a professional career&quot; because that was what my parents believed was the road to financial prosperity (not necessarily great wealth.) But I was never really suited for the lack of independence, the snobby corporate atmosphere, the modern-careerist mindset that I found.<br />At about age 20, I met a good friend (a merchant) who is a &quot;millionaire next door&quot; as these authors profile them. He does have a high income; his wealth does not come merely from extreme frugality. However, he does clip coupons, drive an old pickup truck (bought new but ten years old,) and make spaghetti sauce from scratch because the prepared stuff is &quot;a ripoff.&quot; (He also owns a mansion and will &quot;waste&quot; money -- thousands!-- on leisure pursuits he values.)<br />The authors of this book articulated something for me -- STATUS costs money. That reality is what I'd been experiencing and what had had me troubled. For some of my college friends having a &quot;high-status&quot; job is important. The high-status job itself requires an expensive lifestyle -- meals out because you don't have time to cook, extensive use of a car, etc., all kinds of convenience based spending. The status of the possessions is another issue that I won't discuss now.<br />This book really clued me in: I couldn't care less about having a high-status job. And my belief that a high-staus job is the only path to prosperity (or even security)is nuthin' but a corporate brainwash.
0898705525|5.0|To know the writings of G.K. Chesterson causes one to wonder how Orthodox he could really be! To be orthodox requires a certain seriousness, a constant respect for serious matters.  Yet Chesterson is known to be a boisterous writer, remarking with self-depreciating humor that mystery novels (his own Father Brown sereis belonging to this genre) were the least interesting and formulaic of all novels.  Orthodoxy, however, represents an odd challenge, which Chesterson doesn't seem to be bothered by at all: approaching the serious matters of true religion with wit, the greatest of the Aristotilian virtues. The result is a profoundly intelligent, and remarkably sensible in the Thomistic tradition, work of apologetics and, indeed, philosophy.

6302820448|1.0|The only thing I have to say about this movie when I saw it the first and ONLY time is this...  It was funny, and it was good, all the way up until it was Feb. 2 for the third time.  It must've been Feb. 2 for about 30 days or so.  It got old after a while.  When I saw it in the theater, I actually got up and left the movie because I was tired of waiting to see the end.  I never did find out, and I never will.  The movie seemed like it was six hours long just because of the repetition.  Please don't rent this if you get bored quick.<br />~Natalie Kilpatrick
B00004Z459|5.0|I am not a fan of this type of music at all, but I saw their first video and decided to try it.  Every song on the cd is worth it, not just a few, but every single song.  Some songs sound the same, but the words are very different.
B00003CXA2|5.0|THE STORY OF FORREST GUMP<BR>Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) sits on at a bus stop on a bench in 1981.  A black lady gets off of the bus and Forrest begins talking to her, even though she's ignoring him the whole time.  He starts out by talking about when he was a kid.  Before he begins school, Forrest visits a doctor helping out with his spine, which \\"Is as crooked as a politician\\" notes the doctor.  He then goes into talking about how he got his name, by an Uncle who started the Ku Klux Klan (of course, he IS telling this to a black lady, don't forget).  Afterwards, while walking home with his mother, people along the street stare at Forrest, as if he's wrong and shouldn't even be alive.  Mama (Sally Field) makes sure to let him know that everybody's different, and \\"If God intended everybody to be the same he'd have given us all braces on our legs.\\"  Going on away from the storyline, Forrest tells the black gal about how the house he lived in had been in the family throughout Grandpa's, and the house had been there about a thousand years (remember, this guy's slow).  Mama then tries enrolling Forrest into a public school, however, his IQ isn't quite what they need to get him in.  Mama demands that Forrest get the same education as everyone else.  Mama does get him into school alright, by doing what every woman needs to do when it comes to getting higher up in the food chain.  Next, young Forrest gets on the bus to go to school for the first time.  Later the next day or so, Forrest is caught by Mama pestering a man with a guitar (supposedly Elvis Pressley).  Forrest ends up to show him some moves while dancing to the sounds of the guitar, which were later used by Elvis in concerts.  He explains to the black lady that \\"that young man\\" died for some reason, but it must be hard being a King.  After not wanting to get on the bus because of the bus driver being a stranger, they introduce themselves, and they're on their way.  However, nobody will let Forrest sit with him.  They know that he's different, and nobody wants a thing to do with him, except Jenny.  They began a conversation all the way to school.  After school, kids start throwing rocks at Forrest, Jenny tells him to run, so he does.  Forrest's leg braces break off, and he begins really running, faster than the kids can pedal their bikes.  He runs through town, where the people in the beginning of the movie gave him dirty looks saw him, they looked on in amazement.  Later on, a few days later, he goes to find Jenny because she didn't go to school.  Forrest begins knocking on the front door, runs around back, and finds Jenny there.  He begins asking Jenny questions, but Jenny doesn't want Forrest talking loud because her father's sleeping.  When they find out that he has been wakened, they begin running through the corn field to hide.  They begin praying that God turn her into a bird so that she can fly far, far, far away.  Instead, she moves into her Grandma's by order of the police.  She snuck out often to see Forrest because she was scared.  Forrest assumed that it was because of her Grandma's dog.<br />HISTORICAL EVENTS<BR>Although I'd like to tell you the rest of the story, this is only the first 3 chapters in the movie.  After this, Forrest has grown up.  Forrest meets many celebrities along the road of his life, including Elvis Pressley, many Presidents, etc.  He \\"accidentally\\" steps into some of the most important aspects of History, including when the first blacks were enrolled into a white college, playing on the All American Football Team in college, the Vietnam War where he meets Bubba and promises to start a shrimpin' business with him after they get out of the war, and many others.  You'll have to find out to see for yourself.  Most all of the historical editing is done superbly, with Hanks being inserted into many of the scenes.<br />2001 TWO-DISC DVD SET<BR>The re-release version in 2001 contains \\"Through The Eyes Of Forrest Gump,\\" Outtakes, and how they made special effects work.<br />MY OPINION<BR>In my personal opinion, this is a great movie.  It has no plot, there is no evil, just Forrest, his Mama, and the friends he meets along the way.<br />~Natalie Kilpatrick
6300251616|5.0|This is an excellent movie and has very good special effects for what resources O'Bannon and Carpenter had.  I especially liked the hyper-speed sceen with the planet zipping away and the ship disappearing into hyperspace.  This was a funny movie, especially O'Bannon's character, which was the most deranged of the bunch.  &quot;I don't like the men on this spaceship, they do not appreciate my 'finer' qualities.&quot;<br />This film gives you an idea of what space travel would most likely be like.  Just a series of meanial chores and boredom.  Much like a job at a warehouse(and feeding the rabid dog) and no weekend off at the beach.<br />I have the cassete version of this and the expansion scenes are at the end of the tape instead of integrated.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|beatles 1 is a great collection of hits, highlighting incredible songs that characterize the beatles as most people know them.  the hits range from the early turn of beatles stardom and into the final stages.  however, the album, being a compilation of #1 hits, doesn't capture the true essence of the beatles or hint at their artistic growth over time.  great album, but if the beatles mean more to you than top-40, then this album might not satisfy your urge for the musical essence of the beatles.

B00003CXZ1|3.0|I was slightly disappointed with Tomb Raider.  The aspects leaned toward being unrealistic with over the top action.  I dont mind a sub realistic plot like the alignment of the planets and an ancient time device that can be utilized for good or evil, but lets the make the physical abilities of the characters a little more realistic.  I know Laura is an asskicking relic hunter and I really enjoyed watch Jolie bring her to life, but I would like a hint of believability.  The scene where her arm is healed by a Buddhist is almost useless.  If her entire body had been damaged or she was near death, this scene would have been more striking.  But it was almost unnecessary.   The movie is an entertaining adventure and hopefully if they make a sequel, they will work on the script and story.    Jolie certainly has expressed immediate interest but hopefully she will stick to her word and stand fast to her desire for a better script.

0805062971|5.0|Both. Fight Club dives deep into the mind of an insomniac with a death wish. Our nameless hero meets a man named Tyler Durden, who seems to be everything the narrirator wishes he was. The two soon form a bond. And late one night Tyler requests an odd favor of the hero &quot;I want you to hit me as hard as you can.&quot; The two then physically take out thier anger on one another, fighting not thier friend, but everything they hate in the world. It is here that fight club is born. But as the popularity of fight club spreads like wild fire and Tyler's twisted philosophies reach more and more minds it grows into something more. And all our &quot;everyman&quot; hero can do is be dragged along. I'm not the quickest reader in the world, but I finished Fight Club in about a day. It's a quick read, but don't just blaze through it. I found myself going back through and re-reading parts. This is easily one of the best books I've read. However, and this is a sincire warning, if you are easily disturbed, paranoid, or don't like anything controversial, you may want to stear clear of this. There are people who, if they read this book, would feel a need to ruin it for everyone else. Those people are called cowards and fools.<br />Mischief, Mayhaem, Soap. FIGHT CLUB.
B00005NW02|5.0|Toxicity burns away at your ears until it reaches into your skull and makes you realize just how (expletive deleted) good it is. From the first track you realize your'e dealing with much more than anything else that's being offered in the metal scene today. The pulse of the music along with Serj Tankian's scowl makes for instantly gratifying music to move to and the lyrics certainly make you think a hell a lot more than anything bands like Drowning Pool or Slipknot have been putting out. Although I do enjoy Slipknot's brand of metal (I'm not a fan of Drowning Pool), SoaD bring the element of true substance into there music much more with the words that have been penned by Tankian. The entire album never falters from this incredible starting point, but does change into some incredibly melodic territory in a few songs, showing off the entire band's musicianship; along with guitarist Daron Malakian's ear for a great song, as he writes most of the music on the record. On an album this good it's very hard to pick favorite tracks, especially when some of the best go right into other songs. This is another credit to Malakian who co-produced the record with legendary producer Rick Rubin (if you have any thoughts of Rubin that don't involve the tag of legendary, check out Metallica's self titled album, the Beastie Boys-Licensed To Ill, and the still new, already classic Red Hot Chili Peppers-Californication). But I will add that I believe my personal favorites on the album are &quot;Deer Dance&quot; and &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;. I became a fan of SoaD as soon as I heard their first record, but this one is already showing how much they've improved with the touring that followed that sick debut. To end I will just say that in a time when heavy music is all about angry white boys who've got their hands on some turntables (which isn't a bad thing, but overkill is overkill), and the puddles of (expletive deleted) that they are putting out it's nice to see that System of a Down is there to tell people what they should really be angry about. Buy this record, see SoaD live, support music that means something.<BR>P.S. I'm not one to give out 5 star reviews for any record i just &quot;like&quot;, so trust me on this one.
B00005NW02|5.0|Just purchased this cd and boy was i surprised...I caught bits and pieces of the their first ablum and wasnt impressed but something told me, on the strength of &quot;chop suey&quot; video, to give this a chance.  I am glad I did.  Besides chop suey, Bounce and Forest are immediate standouts.  Just what metal heads needed a band that isnt pretty looking bringing back guitar rifts and great lyrics.  Hopefully, between At the Drive In and A system of a Down can spawn metal and hard rock back to where it belongs!
B000059MEK|5.0|This is some of the most beautiful cheese ever put on record..<BR>.
B00005NW02|4.0|SOAD have to be one of the most original bands on the scene at the moment, and as such, are deserving of huge recognition (although I'm not too sure if they'll get it, at least on my side of the water). This album is both intelligent and entertaining, and shows what great musicians the 4 band members are. Stand out tracks for me are Toxicity and Aerials (the more mellow tracks), but Bounce is a classic. I knew after hearing their first album that I was onto something great, and this album proves it!! One of the big disappointments is that they didn't get Mike Patton to appear on the album, which had been rumoured - oh well, I guess we can't have everything.
B000021YQV|5.0|At first listen i was a little unsure.  I really loved the first album and at any volume it was played seemed to have a huge impact.  On this one it didn't seem as the raw production was there.  Ever since then tho it has really grown on me.  Tracks like 'Prison Song', 'Needles', 'Chop Suey!' and 'Toxicity' are the obvious stand out tracks that are the selling point for the album, but there is something so special and original in every track.  Tracks like 'Shimmy' seem to have a pop element in the chorus and you can't avoid tapping your feet to it.  There are also mellow tracks on this album to break up the noise onslaught every once in a while, tracks like 'ATWA' and 'Aerials' highlight this.  This is an album you need if you are into hard rock but are looking for something a little bit more original.  What a superb album!
B00005NW02|5.0|Let me say that I have the first album, and love that, and this is just as good. It's got the same attitude and is still heavy. It may have a few more slower songs, but they're just as good in their own way. If you liked the first one, you should like this one, and if you're a fan of hard rock, then you should like this.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Oh, lawd.<br />I'm sure Fred Durst is a nice guy, really. I feel that he had the best of intentions with Chocolate Starfish.<br />But OH, LAWD.<br />That's all there is to say, really. Oh, lawd. Limp Bizkit, the band that aspires to be the &quot;Most Hated in the World&quot;, has had a humongous fall from grace here. After the entertaining-but-uneven &quot;3 Dollar Bill Y'all&quot; and the solid from start to finish &quot;Significant Other&quot;, Durst and Co. simply try to do a repeat of their last CD, only to fall flat on their face. It's hypocritical in some spots as well, with Fred's bragging about dating Playboy models and then immediantly jumping into comical attempts at reflection of disoriented youth. Uh, there's a difference between diverse subject matter and just being schizophrentic, Freddy. The angst-ridden commentary isn't all that great, either, with songs like &quot;My Generation&quot;, which is more or less a bunch of profanity in between the words &quot;my generation&quot;. The energy and grooves are there, but that relentless Bizkit charm is really reigned in.<br />If the critics thought before that they were merely an attitude in search of a groove, this won't help the matter. There's no particular stick-out track here, with the possible exception of &quot;Take a Look Around&quot; (the song from the MI2 soundtrack), the only song here with a serious brain. I couldn't find any songs that burst out on their own. I must say though, there's a sheer bright spot- the lead single &quot;Rollin&quot;. The song's so blithering, unbelievably stupid, juvenile and unrelevant that it's actually a complete gasser. I mean, c'mon- you can't help but laugh when you see the rooftop video and Fred waving his arms like the proverbial white-boy gangsta. All in all, C.S.A.T.H.D.F.W doesn't just bank itself on the chance of obnoxiousness, it completely falls over the edge, and the sad thing is that it didn't have to happen.<br />I usually don't make recommendations afternegative reviews, but if you're new to the Bizkit, pick up &quot;Significant Other&quot;, because there they have it all together, and they're swinging for the fences without shame.
B00000634J|5.0|One would have to use a bigger world than genius to discribe John Lennon. This man was part of a musical atomic explosion that brought us a revolution in our world! This album brings out the best of the best of his work being solo. I think one would have a hard time picking a favorite but listening to &quot;cold turkey&quot; pretty much hits the nail on the head. That is if you're thinking of doing drugs. You can feel the pain he went through getting rid of his own addiction. Only John could put it in a song. I would recomnd this album to everyone young and old.
B00004Z459|5.0|Personally, this CD is my absolute favorite, residing permanently in my stereo.  Linkin Park's debut album can be compared to the other rock/rap CDs that share the same shelf, but that would be an injustice.  Hybrid Theory is an eclectic mix of hard-core rock, mellower alternative, and one track of simply acoustic music that sounds like a cross between Beethoven and Metallica.  The lyrics are deep and heart-felt, sung skillfully by lead singer Mike Shinoda, set to a unique and pulsing background.   These CD works for those who like more mainstream music, or for hard-core fans.  No matter who you are, this CD is worth it.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I first known about this band when I saw all the big displays at a music store in a mall. Oh great! I thought. Another hyped-up commercial bit to push to the kids. I assumed they used a collection of bad music to hype up the cartoons. It never occured to me that real talent was behind it. So I saw all three videos including &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; on a Friday night on cable. (One of the few times I got away from my friends on a Friday night to watch cable.) I was impressed so a few days later I bought the CD. I have not regret it. The three videos gave me the idea the music is different on each track. I was surprised I was right. Every song is different and defies description. I loved all the songs on the video and there are other gems on this CD as well like &quot;Slow Country&quot; and &quot;Dracula&quot; it is Albarn's vocals that seem to tread all these songs together. I guess the best description to this music as &quot;Zombie Underground Hip/Hop&quot;. I agree with other reviewers that this is a great album for driving. It is music to play when you are at a Starbuck, you gaze over your Vaio laptop and see an urban wasteland. So what! I choose to live in an urban wasteland. The sound is perfect for it.
B00005A46T|5.0|Corey sings a little bit more in this one, but the first album established a sound that is uncomparable to any other! He would scream and almost laugh at the sametime(eyeless). His voice was much more intimidating, he sounded more insane. But dont get me wrong i love IOWA it aint as raw as the first, it has songs like 'the plague' that remind me of songs from the first album(me inside). ....
B000021YQV|5.0|i just have to say that this album is just great, it follows well in the footsteps of the other.<BR>these guys know how to rock, pure and simple.<BR>do your self a favor and pick up this loud mess of great rock.
0451457994|5.0|I believe this book Is Great, it would have to be my very favourite book. I thaught it was so good that i went to my local video store and hired it straight after i finished and watched it and to my dissapointment it was hopless, fair enough it is a classic but it has everything and if i hadn'y first read the book i wouldn't have understood it at all, But getting back to the book, it is marvelous.
B00005NW02|4.0|System of A Down somehow manages to combine the political content of Rage Against The Machine, the emotion of Tool and the music of... well, SOAD. The vocals are quite unique, being more than the sum of their parts: Death metal growls, plaintive wails, militant barking and melodic singing; it works. The music itself is simply a step forward for it's genre. The band doesn't allow the detuned riffs to blur into a mess. Once a riff has had it's time in the sun, it's retired and the band stops on a dime. Tempo shifts, eastern melodies and the unapologetic sound of insanity make up the band's &quot;hooks&quot;, but unlike other popular acts, the band keeps their sense of humor (which is fully on display on the extra disc). <br />  Serj Tankian's fascinating yet confusing lyrics (&quot;Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup - Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?&quot;)  hint at sinister themes such as domestic abuse and violence, yet the words don't paint the clearest picture. The perspective of the lyrics seem to shift with the tempo, creating a cinematic effect which makes the music that much more compelling. <br />  I consider this record a step forward for two reasons. The first SOAD album was good, but far less textured and subtle. The band seems to be more confident in their own personal style and more likely to head further into their own twisted world. There's nothing more arresting than artists fully committed to their own concepts. In addition to that, SOAD seem to be moving away from the pack and becoming more popular because of it. In a climate of music acts that the average person can't differentiate between, it's notable and wonderful that a band can separate from the pack and be lauded for it.<br />  Fans of heavy music will undoubtedly appreciate the sound of this band, as it is not a strict departure from the conventions of the genre. The level of talent, however, is undeniable and indicative of future success. The members of the band, all of whom are of Armenian descent, hold a new patent for bizzare, eastern tinged, political-minded heavy music. An indication of the divergent paths found on this record can be encapsulated in the \\"thank you\\" section of the liner notes: Thanks to \\"God, Buddha, Allah and Lucifer because they are all so lovely.\\" Well, there you go.
0452282152|5.0|In this radiant novel we are introduced to the minutia of family life in 17th century Holland as seen through the eyes of the maid Griet, a sixteen-year-old girl who became the subject of a famous painting by Johannes Vermeer.  This is in fact the story of how she became his subject.  As such it is a fiction fused into history, an imagination of Vermeer and the life of one of his models.  It is a tale that makes us see with alacrity the poverty of choices that a girl without means had in that world, a world caught between feudalism and the rise of the mercantile class.  Indeed, Griet had only her cleverness to stay her as she maneuvered among the men and women of privilege who would control her life.<br />Novelist Tracy Chevalier has a gift for expression and a great talent for telling a tale and weaving into the fabric of her story the poignant details of everyday life.  Somehow she makes those details and the acting out of the petty politics of domestic life utterly enthralling.  Her first-person narrative of an illiterate girl charms and disquiets by turns.  Although this may seem a far-fetched comparison, I was reminded of Mark Twain's Huck Finn, also illiterate, who nonetheless waxed poetic with not just a novelist's but a painter's eye for detail.  The words they use are everyday words, but spun out so beautifully, so aptly that they become something close to poetry, all the while maintaining plausibility.  In truth no maid nor elegant lady of learning could express herself so well as this girl, but that is the novelist's license, and Chevalier uses it well.<br />Griet has these choices: a butcher's son with blood under his fingernails; Vermeer, who has a wife and five children (and a sixth on the way); and van Ruijven, Vermeer's rich and lecherous patron, who also has a family.  She cannot move to another city, although sometimes she vaguely expresses this childish dream.  She, like the vast majority of humankind before the Industrial Revolution, was fated to live and die in the town of her birth.  Her life was controlled by the choices she had in men; and what would become of her depended on how she handled those choices.  She could not take a job and live alone.  She could not abandon her poverty-stricken parents.  She could only steer between the rocks and the shoreline, torn between her heart's desire and her good Dutch rationality.  Thus, on one level, this is a disturbing tale of how people, especially women, were subject to the dictates of property and privilege, without real choice, working six days a week, from sunup to sundown, for subsistence wages in economic subservience to the privileged few.  On another level this a Horatio Alger story of how one might, through hard work, right morality, a bit of clever common sense and--in this case--a pretty face, rise above one's predicament in life.  Or, perhaps how one might try.  This is also a tale of how our emotions lead us to ends both desirous and disastrous.  Griet loves her master, as all good maids should, almost inevitably.  Hers is a restrained and protracted love, beyond her control, so that she is caught.  In this sense Chevalier's book is a romantic novel, a woman's interest tale of how the heart's desire may or may not be fulfilled.  The beloved is a station above Griet; he is an accomplished artist, and he is taken--consumed in a sense--with his work and his large family, and yet she, as her brother points out, &quot;wants him.&quot;<br />One of the nice things about this book is the reproduction of the celebrated Vermeer painting, &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; on the cover.  As one reads, one can easily refer to the painting again and again; and this is valuable because part of Chevalier's story is an imagination of how the work was painted through an intense study of the painting itself.  Those in the visual arts I imagine will find this part of the novel fascinating, and may speculate on how closely Chevalier came to a truth about the process of artistic creation.  Chevalier's interpretation includes the idea that the painting was the artist's way of making love to the girl.  There can be no doubt of that.<br />I wish I could write with such grace and with such a feel for the felicitous detail and the absolutely apt phrase that is the hallmark of Chevalier's prose.  I also wish I had the cunning to construct a novel so carefully.  I knew I was in the thrall of a master as early as page nine when Griet learns that she is to clean Vermeer's studio without disturbing anything so that every object is returned to exactly where it had been.  Chevalier has Griet remark: &quot;After my father's accident we had learned to place things where he always knew to find them.  It was one thing to do this for a blind man, though.  Quite another for a man with a painter's eyes.&quot;  Or, on page 163, Griet is home visiting her mother, and a &quot;neighbor, a bright-eyed old woman who loved market talk,&quot; was there amid the rumors that Griet would appear in a painting alongside the lecherous van Ruijven.  Griet tells her mother, &quot;my master is beginning the painting that you were asking about.  Van Ruijven has come over...Everyone who is to be in the painting is there now.&quot;  Griet then observes that the gossipy neighbor &quot;gazed at me as if I had just set a roast capon in front of her.&quot;  Griet adds, &quot;That will take care of the rumors.&quot;<br />Such skilled and subtle writing moves the reader along with a sense of deep involvement, and opens wide the eyes of other writers, who might learn from the very accomplished and gifted Tracy Chevalier.cess of artistic creation.

B00005AREQ|5.0|Quite simply, this release is a masterpiece.  I hate how people often compare &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;Blow by Blow&quot;, always preferring one over the other.  Here is what I think.  They are both suberb recordings, fairly similar but each with its own feel.  Get them both! You can't have one without the other if you are a Jeff Beck fan.

B000021YQV|4.0|This may have been the most anticipated album of the year for me. I loved System of a Down's self-titled album. It is one of my favourite albums of the last couple of years. I wasn't expecting to get a sophmore effort that could match their debut, and truthfully, I didn't. Serj's vocals are still just as amazing. He patterns himself perfectly around the best vocalist in the history of rock music, Mike Patton. His vocals on &quot;Forest&quot; perfectly display his amazing range and dexterity. Shavo's bass licks work well with his counterparts, Daron Malakian, heavy guitar riffs. My complaint is Darons guitar work. Although he used 12 tracks of guitar (only two on the debut) they seem much more repetitive then they were on the debut. Still, I think he is a talented guitarist. The main riff of &quot;Science&quot; sounds like something that would come out of a 70s metal album. One of the highlights of the disc in my opinion is John's drumming. I feel he has solidified himself as one of the better metal drummers of the new millenium. John displays a great knowledge of the art of drumming with the most complex time signature's one will ever hear from a new millenium metal band. Lyrically, this album also posesses some gems. &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;Deer Dance&quot;, and &quot;Prison Song&quot; are all filled with terrific, thought provoking lyrics. Although I think self-titled was better; System of a Down have still passed the painful test of the sophmore effort with flying colors.
B00005MAM2|5.0|The movie everybody knows then I'll review the DVD, not the movie. The transfer is very good, not a perfect one but it's very nice. The English track is not very good (since I'm Brazilian, we are used to watch dubbed movies then we know when is not very nice dubbed) but the japanese is great! The Extras are very very nice. The special about the soundtrack is a very nice one. The interview with Mr. Otomo is great and very complete. I liked the feature that translates the graffitis from japanese to english. The box is a neat one! The metal case just stands out in my DVD collection. Overall it is a must have to all animation fans.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I didn't expect to like this movie particularly. I thought it was about southern baptists or something but I really enjoyed it, largely because I loved the music.<br />The fact that they state at the beginning that it is based on Homer's Odyssey was a bit of a distraction - I kept wondering &quot;was this in the odyssey?&quot; and it might have been more fun (in fact, I know it would have been more fun) if they hadn't TOLD us it's based on the Odyssey, and we, the viewers were allowed to make the connection ourselves.
B000021Y77|5.0|Every now and then, a great foreign film makes its way across the pond. And films like &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; makes me wonder how many other great foreign films we're missing out on because Hollywood is unwilling to distribute them to American audiences. Of course, there's also the minor fact that, until recently, few Americans were willing to give subtitled films a chance. <br />&quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is a masterpiece. Combine the look of Madonna's &quot;Ray of Light&quot; music video, and the inter-twined subplots of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and you get a basic feel of what to expect from Lola. The soundtrack fits the film like a glove, doing for Lola what say, a John Williams soundtrack does for a Spielberg film. You owe it to yourself to run, not walk, and check this film out in its original German (down with dubbing!) ... wide screen if possible.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I have a big problem with people who say Star Wars I has racism in it just because Jar Jar speaks English with Jamaican accent. What is racism, by dictionary, racism is a belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others. So my question to those who say Star Wars I has racism is this: Do you think American English is superior than Jamaican English? No matter if you do or not, let's consider another fact, is American English superior or British English superior?<BR>In my opinion, no accent is superior than another, it's just the matter of how many people are using a particular accent. By the way, most people in Star Wars universe speak American accent, should a English man say that's racism too?<br />Speaking of the film, can you really believe that Jar Jar would speak a perfect British accent? That would make people laugh. And remember, Star Wars is not made just for Americans, it's made for all audience around the globe. And people elsewhere don't have the accent issue at all, why Americans are so different? Stop saying RACISM now.
B00005NW02|4.0|If these songs don't get your blood flowing, I don't know what will. Most of them are mind-blowingly intense. And I dare you to try to keep up with Serj Tankian's vocals. A few of the songs frequently change back and forth between being fast-paced and being slow and sensitive, and the guys pull it off excellently. If you liked System's first album, 'Toxicity' will blow you away. By the way, if you buy 'Toxicity,' make sure you get the Limited Edition. It includes a CD-ROM containing some great footage of the recording process, including commentaries from each band member.

B000059MEK|2.0|It's definitely true that most people will write reviews for albums that they love (... and perhaps one's they truly hate). I thought I'd balance this trend. <br />I probably wouldn't have purchased this disc had it not been for a friend of mine who'd said he'd heard it and told me to \\"just get it\\", as it was \\"amazing\\". He didn't tell me that he'd only listened to it once after he'd returned from a large night clubbing and subsequently slumped on the couch with an enormous spliff in his mouth. Not that that invalidates things, but he did later apologise and admitted that he'd made a mistake! <br />Homework was a good album and some truly original thought when down on that one. Discovery sees the boyz move closer to that dreamy territory occupied by their compatriots Air. Unfortunately these guys seem to have a penchant for eighties vocador style vocals and even when they find a groove that seems promising, they just can't seem to pull it off! <br />I didn't like this record... Frankly, it ... me off.
074322454X|1.0|For readers without much background in history in general or the military in particular, Band of Brothers will probably seem like a heroic saga of male-bonding in combat. However, for those readers with knowledge of the subject, this poorly-researched book offers little more than the standard episode of the old TV series COMBAT! Author Stephen Ambrose, who favors oral history over meticulous research, used his interviews with selected Second World War veterans from E Company, 506th PIR, 101st Airborne as the basis for recounting the tales of an airborne company in combat in 1944-1945. Most of the book focuses on Richard Winters, who commanded the company in Normandy and Holland. Private David Webster, a cynical self-proclaimed intellectual also wrote a book of his experiences in E Company, from which Ambrose has borrowed liberally [...]. Interviews with other members in the unit fill in gaps, but Winters and Webster are two of the primary protagonists in the story. Unfortunately from the viewpoint of historical accuracy, the book is hopelessly riddled with errors, exaggerations and vicious slander.<br />  First, let me address the errors, which are mostly due to lack of research on the author's part. Ambrose claims that the troop transport to England \\"carried 5,000 men from the 506th\\" and how it was a cramped voyage. Yet Shelby Stanton's authoritative US Army Order of Battle in World War Two, states that the 506th had only 2,029 men. Ambrose has his usual problems with nomenclature and names; Germans used 81mm not \\"80mm\\" mortars. A British officer rescued by E Company is identified as \\"Colonel O. Dobey,\\" when it was actually LTC David Dobie. The German officer who surrendered to the unit at Berchtesgaden in 1945 is described as the 35 year-old \\"General Theodor Tolsdorf, commander of LXXXII Corps,\\" when it was actually a 36 year-old Colonel Tolsdorf who commanded the 340th VG Division. At Berchtesgaden, Winters supposedly finds a German Major General \\"Kastner\\" who committed suicide, but there is no record of such an officer in the Wehrmacht or SS. Nor does Ambrose do much better with unit identifications and he claims that in the Battle of the Bulge, the 101st Airborne Division, \\"had won its head-to-head battles with a dozen crack German armored and infantry divisions.\\" Actually, the Germans only committed elements of five divisions to the Bastogne fighting and they were hardly crack troops. Ambrose's statement also ignores the fact that the 101st was fighting with considerable help from the US 9th and 10th Armored Divisions in Bastogne. Finally, readers may be shocked to learn that the US 3rd Infantry Division actually beat the 506th PIR in the race to Berchtesgaden by several hours. Readers should check Clay Blair's well-researched Ridgeway's Paratroopers. These errors may seem minor to some, but they demonstrate a lack of research that means the whole narrative is suspect.<br />  When it comes to exaggeration, Ambrose pulls out the stops. All enemy tanks are referred to as \\"Tigers,\\" but only 5.3% of the German tanks in Normandy in June 1944 were Tigers. All enemy troops are referred to as \\"elite,\\" such as SS or paratroops, even though German records indicate that the 506th mostly fought ordinary Wehrmacht units. According to Winters, E Company was always better than the other companies in the 506th and Ambrose vouches that, \\"there was no better light infantry company in the Army.\\" How about the Rangers at Point du Hoc? Since Ambrose makes no effort to compare E Company with any other similar unit (e.g. did it kill more Germans than other units?), this assertion is asinine. It gets worse. Ambrose asserts that Winters \\"is contemptuous of exaggeration,\\" but the following account of E Company in Normandy flatly exposes this as a lie: \\"So was Winters [outstanding]. He made one right decision after another &#8230;he personally killed more Germans and took more risks than anyone else.\\" So Winters killed more Germans than the company machine-gunners? He took more risks than the men on point? Interestingly, Winters was never wounded.<br />  The worst aspect of the book is the vicious slander campaign, which is pure Winters. Winters attacks his superiors, starting with MGN Taylor, Commander of the 101st, then COL Sink who was commander of the 506th PIR, then LTC Strayer his battalion commander and CPT Sobel, the first commander of E Company. Taylor, who was one of the best US Army generals of the 20th Century and later Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Kennedy, is viciously attacked for being on \\"Christmas Vacation\\" during the Battle of the Bulge and for ordering an attack that \\"had the flavor of an ego trip.\\" Winters tells Ambrose that \\"I don't want to be fair,\\" about Taylor. Ergo, he doesn't want to be honest. Sink, who commanded the 506th for the entire war is derided as \\"Bourbon Bob.\\" LTC Strayer is virtually omitted from this account, even though he commanded from Normandy to VE Day. Ambrose misleads the reader when he states that Winters became the battalion commander on 8 March 1945 - in fact the switch was only temporary and Strayer returned. Winters reserves special hatred for CPT Sobel, the man who trained E Company stateside and who is labeled a petty tyrant. Winters recounts a chance encounter with Sobel later in the war, when Winters outranked his former commander, and he proceeded to humiliate him in front of enlisted men from E Company. Classy. The slander campaign is also directed at other officers who succeeded Winters as commander of E Company, most of the lieutenants, staff officers, \\"Air Force slobs in England,\\" (who were dying by the hundreds over Germany in burning bombers), the British, etc. It's pretty sickening after awhile. The American paratroopers of the Second World War deserve a far more accurate and honest account of their accomplishments, with just recognition of all deserving participants, than a slanted account that distorts the record.y machine-gunners? He took more risks than the men on point? Interestingly, Winters was never wounded.<br />  The worst aspect of the book is the vicious slander campaign, which is pure Winters. Winters attacks his superiors, starting with MGN Taylor, Commander of the 101st, then COL Sink who was commander of the 506th PIR, then LTC Strayer his battalion commander and CPT Sobel, the first commander of E Company. Taylor, who was one of the best US Army generals of the 20th Century and later Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Kennedy, is viciously attacked for being on \\"Christmas Vacation\\" during the Battle of the Bulge and for ordering an attack that \\"had the flavor of an ego trip.\\" Winters tells Ambrose that \\"I don't want to be fair,\\" about Taylor. Ergo, he doesn't want to be honest. Sink, who commanded the 506th for the entire war is derided as \\"Bourbon Bob.\\" LTC Strayer is virtually omitted from this account, even though he commanded from Normandy to VE Day. Ambrose misleads the reader when he states that Winters became the battalion commander on 8 March 1945 - in fact the switch was only temporary and Strayer returned. Winters reserves special hatred for CPT Sobel, the man who trained E Company stateside and who is labeled a petty tyrant. Winters recounts a chance encounter with Sobel later in the war, when Winters outranked his former commander, and he proceeded to humiliate him in front of enlisted men from E Company. Classy. The slander campaign is also directed at other officers who succeeded Winters as commander of E Company, most of the lieutenants, staff officers, \\"Air Force slobs in England,\\" (who were dying by the hundreds over Germany in burning bombers), the British, etc. It's pretty sickening after awhile. The American paratroopers of the Second World War deserve a far more accurate and honest account of their accomplishments, with just recognition of all deserving participants, than a slanted account that distorts the record.cord.
B000007SPU|5.0|I absolutely love this album. A friend made us a tape of this back in 1986 after he got it for xmas(on vinyl, no less). It's been one of our favorites since. And, more importantly, it introduced us to different kinds of music..different sounds and instruments, and ways of singing that have just taken us to other artists we love that we may never have known about if it were not for This Mortal Coil. I'm not going to rate it next to the other TMC works, which we own also, because they are all different and special.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|I rate this movie highly. I thought the way the film ended was a little stupid, but the movie had enough action to keep just about anyone satisfied. The acting was great and the movie kept up a good pace. I thought the dept charge seqences were filmed extremely well and you got a little of that closed in feeling of being on a actual submarine. The film still cannot hold a candle to &quot; Das Boot &quot; however.
0780020685|2.0|While Seven Samurai contains great acting and brave direction (not many directors would use such long pauses in dialogue and action in a movie, a style used hear to powerful affect) I found over three hours difficult to get through.  The plot is a simple one, and could have been told as completely in a much shorter length film.  If like me, you are a lover of film watching, rather than a lover of film making, don't expect too much from Seven Samurai.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|&quot;Memento&quot; is surely one of the most innovative pictures in recent years. Christopher Nolan's screenplay (based on a short story by his brother Jonathan) is terrific and introduces us to a complete new way of storytelling. The script should be a shoe-in for an Academy Award nomination.<br />Nolan very wisely chose relatively unknown actors to play in his complex thriller, so that the audience can focus on the bewildering story. Pearce, well known for his performance as an honest cop in Curtis Hanson's masterpiece &quot;L.A. Confidential,&quot; does a great job along with &quot;The Matrix&quot; stars Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss.<br />If there is one movie to watch this year, it's definitely &quot;Memento.&quot;
B00005NW02|5.0|The origin of System of a Down was a big hit when it came out, including the smash hit songs spiders, surgar, and war. Now, their new album TOXICITY is gonna be another smash hit. They did alot of changes in their music, including the new smash hit &quot;chop suey!&quot; which is a great song. They done alot of new interesting lyrics and awsome tones in their songs. This album is excellent.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I can't believe that there are some people out there thinking that she wrote the song &quot;(I can't get no) Satisfaction&quot;. This Rolling Stones' masterpiece doesn't deserve this absurd remake. Boring and stupid &quot;album&quot;.
B00003CWL6|5.0|In 1999 the Academy Awards folks finally got things right by giving it's top awards to the film, &quot;American Beauty&quot;. This definitely was the best movie put out that year. A modern classic in the making. In this era of Hollywood blockbusters, where special effects and noise seem to take precedence over well written sripts and acting, it is a true pleasure to find such an articulate, meaningful and well made film. This is the story of an upper middle class family, who's lives are turned upside down, when outsiders seperately come into their world. A father, mother and a teenage daughter all experience emotional awakenings and transformations, that later will have strong repercussions on thier lives.In the end this is a film about finding beauty and happiness in this world. Alan Ball (of HBO's &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;) has written a brilliant script which seems to make you want to laugh and cry at the same time.Director Sam Mendes has pulled off an audacious debut which skillfully brings this story to life.The acting in this film is first rate. Kevin Spacey is fantastic as Lester Birnaum, a man who is just waking up to life. Equaly great is Annettte Bening as his materialistic wife. West Bentley and Thora Birch, who play the teenage lovers, are a real find. I predict both these talented young actors will have very successful careers. As a whole, this is very well packaged and good looking DVD, which is loaded with extras.My favorite of them is the excellent commentary track that director Sam Mendes provides, about the making of the movie.This DVD is well worth your while.
B000021YQV|5.0|This cd really rocks.  SOAD has such a unique and energetic sound.  If you like Tool you'll love this cd.  I also recommend their debut cd.  buy it!
B000003BDJ|5.0|Probably the best compilation album of all time. Jagger/Richard (the s at the end was added after the 1969-Let it bleed). Taking tracks from the best period of the greatest rock band of all time(ok missing songs off-course from the Exile... but this compilation was released immidiately after the Sticky Fingers LP and just before the Exile...). From the early days of &quot;time is on my side&quot; to the garage kinky &quot;drug addicted&quot; riff of Brown Sugar this is the ultimate place for someone to start exploring the magic world of the Rolling stones.<BR>This is were I started having now almost all their LP's and a couple of singles. Don't forget the remarkable collaboration of the one and only Brian Jones. Who do you thing after all transformed Under my thumb from a good song to an all time classic?<BR>A diamond for every music fan!!!!
B00000F14B|5.0|The Music Man is a great inspiration to children who love bands. Shirley Jones is one of the best singers of all, having sung in Carousel as well. And Robert Preston is perfect. To this one I give 5 stars!!!!
B00005NW02|5.0|If their first album wasn't good enough for you... which I don't see how it couldn't be... You should look into getting this album, with the poetic writings of Serj Tankian, and with the melodic Bass and Lead Guitars, mixed with the rythmic drums, this isn't an album to miss!
6305132984|5.0|West Side Story is not just a love story, but an exact duplicate of the famed &quot;Romeo and Juliet!&quot; Natalie Wood is astounding,and the music is beyond compare!

B00000HZTB|3.0|The backing tracks for this album are, for quartet performances, complex and various -- 2 guitars (Reed/Quine), bass (Saunders) and drums engaging in real interplay.  The playing does not sound very spontaneous, but the arrangements are interesting.  Robert Quine deserves a lot of credit for subordinating his considerable talents to Reed's musical style (he played with Reed on one more album, then got the pink slip).  Reed's lyrics are always intelligent; this album has the quality of a slim volume of poems set to appropriate music.  A few of these songs are comical (Average Guy, Underneath the Bottle), and most of them share a distinctly warped character, sounding slapdash and focused all at once.  Reed's singing sometimes sounds like a voice in the shower at a detox center and frankly makes this album less powerful than it might be.  The two classic tracks, &quot;The Blue Mask&quot; and &quot;Waves of Fear,&quot; make this album a keeper anyhow -- Metal Machine-style feedback and guitars in strict stereo separation, Reed bellowing about DTs and castration and incest... jewels in the crown of his long career.
0316776963|5.0|This book is a series of essays about speaking, some of which are laugh out loud funny, and others of which are just pleasant to read. The first few essays are about childhood and the author's speech therapy, and are quite funny and touching. The last few are about the author's attempt to learn French in France. If you have ever tried to learn a foreign language you know the ridiculous, embarassing mistakes you make. I read this book on a plane, and actually had to close the book during these essays because I was convulsing in laughter and the other passengers were starting to look at me funny.<BR>I recommend this book, mainly for the last few essays which I found hysterical. The first few are also good, don't get me wrong!
B00000G09Q|1.0|I remember when i was 8 years old<BR>many fond memories which includes the ninja turtles which in my opinion was the greatest action show for boys and well......<BR>as far as I remember some girls as well.....well the movies at least.<BR>I loved the first and I loved the second movie (actually i liked the second more even though i shouldnt have really)<BR>and the third.......well we can be very cruel and nasty at this movie and give nasty reviews and how it was the cause of the turtles demise but the fact is that turtles had already enjoyed its peak and was already on the way out.<BR>this movie was merely the ninja turtles last breath of air.<BR>however the fact is this movie had a lot less efort put into it than the previous 2 movies which is reflected in the bad use of lip movement by the turtles which mixes badly with the script which obviously was neglected in the making of the movie.<BR>also the costumes had changed slightly for the worst and in one scene if i remember you could see strings on splinters hand as he shuts a window at the start of the movie.<BR>it was little touches like this that bought the movie right down.<BR>then came the hard task for the producers to make a story without shredder involved<BR>and you may say that if the produces had of bought him back for the third movie it would have looked stupid as he clearly died in the 2nd movie but then I have to ask you...would it have mattered really? i mean this movie clearly was just a cheap cash in on the turtles series anyway which was going to be the teams last attemped to make some cash on the dying series so if the movie is ugly anyway would shredders precence have really mattered because in my opinion it would have helped because the movie couldnt have been any worse.<BR>Altough all companys will try to make as much cash as they can on there products its just a shame the turtles series had to go down the same path and was done so badly in the process? just<BR>dont remember the turtles this waybecause i really wish i hadnt<BR>have.<BR>i would like to recommend though on a brighter note that the first and second movies are great and will bring back fond memories of when the ninja turtles were still the greatest.<BR>BUY THEM NOW

B000050FEN|5.0|The most real, gruesome, and outstanding movie I've seen for a while. 2 great Detectives who team up to capture a criminal mastermind, who is trying to make a world wide point of sin, proving that we tolerate sin too much, that people we love are greedy, sowerful, lustful, full to the top sinners. Revolving around the seven deadly sins John Doe [the killer] pins each sin against the sinner forcing them to die by the dreadful sin that they live. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are absolutley great as the detectives, almost complete opposites yet fulfilling eachothers gaps, Freeman as the brains, and Pitt as the eager self centered young one. Kevin Spacey was stand Outish, pulling a great performance as always, and Gweneth Paltrow as the great and loving wife. Directed by David Fincher who also did Fight Club with Brad Pitt, holding the best chase scene I have ever seen in a movie, gripping suspense [especially the end] and spine tingling thrills and a great shot of the killer through the reflection of the puddle coming towards Pitt, the end is very suspensful every time I see it, it doesnt get old, leaving you with a memory you'll never forget, &quot;The Lord Works in Mysterious Ways&quot; so says Doe who believes himself to be doing God's good work. The DVD version is absolutley ausome, for those of you who like behind the scenes stuff, this has alot of it, and the original Theatrical Trailor, I recommend this movie to the ones who can stand those off-setting gruesome shots, but the movie itself is terrific and mind blowing suspense!
B000022TSY|4.0|Dennis Hopper has always struck me as a living relic of the sixties. A counter-culture rebel who never could quite come to terms with the Vietnam era government he so distrusted. Not surprisingly, his portrayal of &quot;Billy&quot;, the frantic companion to Peter Fonda's &quot;Wyatt&quot; is the constantly racing heart of Easy Rider, one of the most important films of the late sixties.<BR>Filmed the year after the summer of love had ended, Rider is one of the few true portraits of the cultural landscape of that turbulent era. The mellow Fonda always represents a generations quest for a simple kind of peace while Hopper, who also directed, is the fatal drive towards a futile end, always pulling away from the obvious path. They ride their custom choppers like two cowboys headed through the wild west. It's an obvious analogy but a meaningful one, their dangers were no less great as we find out. Although a notoriously frazzled production, great performances (notably Jack Nicholson), and a supurb use of some of the great rock road anthems of the day help create something fascinating, if quite dated. Of course, whether you lived the era or not, today the movie stands as a great historical representation of the mood of a country during one of America's strangest periods. Hopper's direction seems subdued by contrast to his performance (outside of a depressing and sureal trip and acid trip through Mardi Gras and a rather blunt ending) although perhaps less so considering his admitted, much longer initial cut, before leveler heads prevailed. There is an obvious fly by night amateurish quality overall but It's still a good film, maybe even great in certain ways. Cultural sign posts like this are rare. Rarer still to be made by the ones who lived it.
0790742780|5.0|The Adventure of An Ordinary Man at War With the Everyday World. Michael Douglas puts in a Stupendous performance as Bill Foster [D-Fense], A man with problems in his life that denied him to have that beautifle home to come to after a long day at work, and to forget about it only at the sight of your little girl's smile. Robert Duvall, oscar winner, is an officer on his last day at retierment, on the other side of the door, dealing with the same things Douglas is but instead of saying &quot;Thats it enough of this crap, all those pretty people in their own worlds tryin to be smart and funney while I get the stiff&quot; like Douglas, Duvall takes it as his wife lost her figure, and a piece of her mind, giving birth to a child only to lose it at 2 years old, and all of his &quot;fellow Officers&quot;, including one cocky son of a gun, that give him junk about his retiering. This became an original, directed by Joel Schumacher, extreme acting here, especially Douglas who won an academy award, and also mixing some very dark humor with all of the rampage he does, noting the drive-by.......slow tempered yet increases with a strikeful ending! The DVD version of this film has one sarcastic Theatrical Trailor, but seeing how its such a great movie its worth it, and those of you who are contemplating on actually seeing the movie, your hearin it here that its a classic.
6305546789|5.0|When Halloween was released back in 1978 few would have imagined it would become one of the most successful independent movies of all time and perhaps the most important horror film since it's release, for good and bad reasons. First the good: Despite an anorexic budget and a group of relative newbies at the helm, Halloween has been crafted as beautifully as anything released by the major studios. John Carpenter has the horror genre in his blood and though he seems to have lost touch over the past twenty years (obvious by pretty much everything after &quot;The Thing&quot;)undoubtedly the inspirations of a youth spent wrapped up in the classics of horror let loose a creative torrent. Besides the often mentioned homages to &quot;Psycho&quot; and the somewhat precognative inclusion of scenes from the original The Thing, Carpenter creates a tapestry of horror that pulls directly from the everyday, late night fears that seep into our subconcious Witness the overwhelmingly creepy sight of Michael Myers carrying one of his victims into the house across the street, as viewed through the window by little Billy, all aurally framed by the harshly disturbing score emanating from the creature feature on t.v. Who hasn't walked by that dark window at night, hearing something and wondering whether you should look outside, afraid you might actually see something. And who hasn't felt that creepy feeling of being alone outside at night, seeing the lights from other houses, knowing that there are people at home, but if something horrible happened no one would know, or want to know. Laurie experiences this first hand, althought she has already met the terror. There are many other moments as well, that transend the cliches that Halloween so deftly created. Smartly written and well acted and stylish in alternately obvious and subtle ways, (a relentlessly sweat popping score, The garish, behind the mask murder by a young Michael contrasted by the decidedly unharsh natural lighting, extremely familiar teens and the quiet suburbia.) The Dr.Loomis character is as much of a contrast to these quiet surroundings as the killer himself. The two seem to have escaped from their own little world in a figurative sense as well. The Loomis aspect of the story is necessary and well done but it's not where the heart of the film lies. That point would be with Laurie, her two best friends and her charges for the night. Shockingly real when compared to the teenager cliches that populate the later flicks of the slasher genre. The three girls speak to each other naturally and without the constraints of being saddled with obvious stereotypes. The true fear generated by this film lies in the fact that we genuinely like these girls and really hate to see anything bad happen to them, probably because we so identify with their lives. The scene that best sums up this feeling and the overall brilliance of the film happens about half way in. Laurie and one of her friends drive to their babysitting jobs, they talk caringly about simple things, getting a date for Laurie and whatnot, Michael follows them but it's in the back of our minds, that beautiful natural lighting comes in as the sun slowly sets, foreboding. The cinematography is elegant and thoughtful, The stop start jolts of the set pieces constantly leaves you on edge, as it does the characters. Undoubtedly the best slasher ever. Now for the Bad: It's nothing about the film itself. Like I've said, it's a masterful work. It has more to do with what the film rought. Not only did it create cliches but it immediately mastered them, leaving little room for brilliant copies. The next decade would see one of the weakest creative periods in horror history. The genre was plentifull but the offspring was genetically weak. Clones of clones of clones of an original. Each new film wallowing in a deeper pile of stagnation and irrelevant gore. Most evident by the constant deevelution of every new franchise. Nightmare on Elm Street, a great film and one of the few high points of the eighties divolved into an increasingly pathetic imatation. And initally poor films got sequels that simply beat the living crap out of a dead horse. The backlash of all this was a near abscence of horror throughout the 90s. Scream redeemed things but only fleetingly as it began to compound the situation. The &quot;wink. wink. nod. nod.&quot; we're in on the joke point of view slipped into the genre and all depth was drained away as the people making the films lost respect for the horror they we're trying to create. As a horror buff I enjoy all of these films, nothings more enjoyable than a lousy horror movie...except maybe a good one. So Halloween is a great film, but it changed the face of horror as we know it. If you want truly revelutionary horror one must go to the seventies, and often even before. It will take another great milestone to set things right. Until then I'll savor the past.at film and one of the few high points of the eighties divolved into an increasingly pathetic imatation.

B00004RJ74|4.0|I'm a big fan of Tarrentino's work, though he gets alot of bad rap I believe him to be one of the most talented writers alive, starting with Resevoir Dogs, he wrote Natural Born Killers, and Four Rooms, Desperado, and finally coming to From Dusk Till Dawn. This movie was a rocker, holding any clues or hints that there would be deradful horror in the last hour. Teaming up with horror man Robert Rodriguez, they put together this very well made horror movie about two criminal crazy boys [George Clooney, Quentin Tarrentino] who are on the run for Mexico, They kidnap a family on road [Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, and the son]and they come to a bar called the T**ty Twisters, they find that the bar is infact an eledged trap for feeding time for the vampires that inhabit it, they have to become a team with their hostages to survive, not to mention a couple other cast members; Fred Williamson, and the Sex Machine. You actually grow to admire the Gecko brothers [Clooney, Tarrentino]and Tarrentino's fine writing, alot of sick and twisted but also real features you'll see, along with bloody vampires nawing on humans, and a sided 4 man battle over a bloody severed body part battle ground, that turns to chaos. The movie was very well put together, starting out with 2 Pulp Fiction guys that run into a bunch of Fright Night vampires, the idea was to act upon the impressionable idea that Stephen King does himself in his novels, that to draw the audience into the story so that they indeed care about the characters and them BAM! vampires come along, you put the characters in this altered world of life and death. This movie is especially good on DVD, the sound is ausome along with the bonus materials, and the wide screen.
B00000DRA9|5.0|The Neverending Story was always one of my favorite movies as a kid, and that love has only deepened as an adult. In part, that's thanks to the movie's amazing soundtrack. It combines the best of 80's synthisizer music with a timeless, emotional score. <br />The first track(the movie's title theme)has an infectious beat and lyrics you just can't help singing along to. The emotions of the different tracks are very clear and very powerful, and track number six(Bastian's Flight)is the perfect music to listen to when you're feeling blah. I found myself grinning and laughing for no real reason after listening to it. The music made me feel *that* good.<br />I'd recommend this to anyone who loved the movie or still loves the 80's techno/pop sound. It's completely worth it!
B000000XB9|5.0|When Rock and Roll music first came out in the mid 1950s with the sounds of Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley, it was a simple, basic, fun, and easy to play music. There was rarely any fancy drumming, no overbearing rythm section, and even the finest guitar players never went overboard and kept their sound rather subdued compared to many artists that broke out in the late 60s. Although many bands and performers who came in the 60s and 70s playing &quot;Rock&quot; and Popular music had talent and were worthy of the fame they achieved, few of them really played down-to-earth, basic roots &quot;Rock and Roll.&quot; Bands like the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Led Zeppelin, and many of the later albums by the Beatles may have had incredible listening power, but few of them played true Rock and Roll music. Perhaps that is why Creedance Clearwater Revival stood out as they did. In a time where the most popular songs were played by long haired hippys with psychodelic overtones or political protests, and many experimenting with the tools the studio had to offer, CCR came out with the sound of basic Rock and Roll music. Like the punk bands of the later 70s, CCR made music fun, easy, and enjoyable. They used bits of county, rockabilly, and cajun influences to spice things up. Although their sound was inspired by the artists of the 1950s, when CCR made it big in 1968 their style was truly unique to them. This album has 20 Classic Rock and Roll tunes from one of the greatest Rock bands in history. Energetic and full of sound, these boys from California wrote some of the most memorable sing-along rock songs in memory. Its hard not to wanna tap your toe and turn up the radio when you hear these songs playing. Even if you've only heard a few of these songs on the radio, this album is a great investment. I can almost garuntee you will be playing this over and over again and fall in love with just about everything you hear. This is Rock and Roll music at its finest.
0804102988|1.0|This book, claiming to be a thorough historical novel, is nothing more than a shallow, boring tale of people who live and die that I couldn't care less about. It was probably written to make the lives of AP European History students hell. First of all, it is too lengthy. The characters never get the chance to develop, and the new characters that are introduced die off in the next 40 or 50 pages anyway. I began to care less and less about each family. Also, for a reason which I have no idea, this novel is FILLED with sex and promiscuity. Why does the author feel the need to include the scene when chief Krona receives Oral Sex? Why does he take the time to include the homosexual encounter between the abbot and the younger disciple, only to have them killed off in the next five pages by Vikings? This book is filled with unnecessary sexual encounters. It was a waste of eight dollars as well a waste of my summer. I would have had more fun researching english history on my own. If you intend to buy this book, you must be an English history buff anyway, so don't waste your time and money with this one. However, if you are interested in fire, the book is quite thick (over 1000 pages)and it would probably burn for a good ten minutes.
0792843584|2.0|If you want to know what's wrong with 'Heaven's Gate', Michael Cimino's notoriously over-ambitious flop Western, look at the opening sequence.  The emphasis is on noise and spectacle, but unlike 'the Deer Hunter', it is not rooted in character.  It is poorly filmed, the camera not staying still long enough to allow us to take it in; the clumsy editing and the refusal of successive camera angles to match breaks up any continuity.  The waltz scene should be magical, but is shot as if by a documentary team recording the making of the film.  John Hurt's smart-alecky, incomprehensible speech is profoundly alienating.  If, after ten minutes in a four-hour film you are lost, than the omens are bad.  <br />Even in its 'full' four hour version, 'Heaven's Gate' seems like it's been badly butchered - the editing is abrupt, the sound is botched.  Whole scenes seem to have been removed, all sense of momentum is repeatedly broken down.  The plot is difficult to follow because the characters keep mumbling, and because the film-making was rarely clear.  Characters are abruptly introduced and abandoned throughout.  There is no attempt to clarify the relationships between characters, place and event.  The action sequences verge on the abstract, dissolving into a senseless fog.  The imagery is similarly fuzzy, and there are too many pointlessly gratuitous camera movements.<br />If 'Heaven's Gate' was supposed to be an epic piece of American storytelling, than it was clearly a failure.  But all the negative things I mentioned above, all no-nos in Hollywood, are virtues in European cinema.  The sense of narrative and generic fracture is pure Godard; the alienation of the individual from narrative, history, society and his environment is very Antonioni.  The attempt to make History and the People the heroes (all those idealising shots of characters against the sky) is familiar from Soviet cinema.  <br />The fact that 'Heaven's Gate' is almost a left-wing picture is another probable reason for its failure.  'The Deer Hunter' took a national trauma (Vietnam) and tried to heal it: hence its success.  'Gate' takes something Americans are proud of - the American way; capitalism - and showed it to be fascist.  this is true, but not what an America who had just voted Reagan wanted to hear.<br />For all its good intentions, there was only one scene I liked, where Christopher Walken hits a bearded colleague: the lightening, dance-like movement was the one moment this lumbering dinosaur threatened to perk up.
B00004SU5J|5.0|this is one of my favorite albums.  The blend of jazz and electronic beats is just perfect.  If you like atmospheric drum&amp;bass like some of LTJ bukem's albums then you will love this album.  I cant get enough of this album.<br />I normally listen to electronica, atmospheric drum&amp;bass, dub, deep house and some jazz.  This album puts them all together into one incredible package.
B000005IRG|5.0|The first couple of listens to 'Marquee Moon' had me fuming at those frauds who compile 'Greatest' or 'Most Important Albums of all time' lists (who are these people anyway?).  I always had Television down as post-punk or New Wave, but the title track was nearly ten minutes of guitar solo self-indulgence, while 'Torn Curtain' was an equally lengthy update of 'Hotel California'.  This was prog-rock in tattier clothes - the singer's pseudonym pinched from a poet revered for exquisite economy seemed like a bad joke. <br />If ever an album, however, rewarded patience, concentration and abandonment, it is 'Marquee Moon'.  What seems over-extended becomes hypnotic, those endless, looping, rhythmic riffs burrowing into your soul.  Length here seizes you, becomes almost spiritual, as in the beautiful 'Guiding Light', whose climactic, hushed rapture is in a different place from its grimy opening; or the haunting and spacious 'Torn Curtain'.  <br />But there is a poppier Television too, closer to contemporaries Blondie, as evidenced on the energetically wistful 'Venus' or the lovely 50s pastiche 'Prove it'.  This Television bequeathed us REM and other powerpop groups, but let's not blame them for that.
0453007902|5.0|This audio production for &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; by Gary Sinise is nothing short of brilliant. Over the years, Mr. Sinise has made John Steinbeck's work a part of his life, being involved with it in various mediums: live plays, a film, and this audio recording. As a result, he seems to have developed a deep connection to this story, and a lively and powerful rendering of the characters is what results. It is the perfect performance of a perfect book.
B00003CXB2|4.0|'Lawrence of Arabia' is more than just a large-scale desert adventure - it's not David Lean's fault he spawned the detritus of modern cinema in the shape of Spielberg, Lucas and their offspring. <br />Like his best epics, it is a thorough, ironic, viciously satiric look at different types of Englisheness, and at the cynical legacy of colonialism. It is a dismantling of the myth of T. E. Lawrence - any heroic successes are either filmed from a distance, minimised by context or not shown at all; triumph is usually quickly followed by bathos or defeat; we see how the myth is created and exploited, how much the man differs from, and fails to live up to, it. <br />It is a film full of classical irony Lawrence himself might have appreciated - a man who nearly kills himself trying to save a man he must later execute; a man who wants to escape one class-ridden society that would dismiss him as 'illegitimate', only to see his dreams destroyed in a land where class differences are murderous. <br />Lawrence, though coming from an opposite viewpoint, is a close relative of Colonel Nicholson in 'Bridge on the River Kwai', a man whose very English faithfulness to a code turns him into a traitor and murderer. <br />The first, longer part of 'Arabia' is especially magnificent, daring the audience to submit to its pace, to feel the monotonous vastness and unknowability of the desert. By focusing on shadows, the swirls of sand bordering the immovable smoothness of dunes, the phantom introduction of Ali, the supernatural power of dust-storms, Lean captures the spiritual sense inherent to Lawrence, and hostile to the narrow-minded bureaucracy of the Army and Empire; these shots, and the many sequences where huge armies become tiny patterns against the awesome desert geometry, seem closer to abstract art than the pomp of the usual historical epic. <br />So rich and detailed is the first half, that Lean seems to have gotten bored, and the second is a mostly dispiriting sequence of noisy,cluttered crowd scenes that is much closer to Lucas and Spielberg, with barely an interesting, never mind beautiful shot. Of course, this could simply be replicating the growing disillusion of Lawrence himself.
B00005NW02|1.0|for whatever reasons, my tastes in music keep changing in ways that i no longer listen to most of the bands i used to.  system would be one of those bands.  i used to like their first effort quite a bit... so i bought this without hesitation.  at first, i guess i liked it a lot.  but now, i realize that it didn't stand the test of time. i saw them live twice, and i concluded that daron malakian just annoys the hell out of me and really needs to shut up and play the solo from 'soil' recognizably.  i'm quite sick of system of a down now.  maybe it's because i keep getting into older, more respectable bands.  maybe it's because as i delve deeper into the world of music i see where the timeless classics are.  system won't be one of those bands.   though they'll probably be up there in the numbers though when VH1 does a top 100 nu metal bands.<br />from what i've gathered, system of a down borrows heavily from dead kennedys and faith no more and uses the 'influence'(or whatever you want to call it), and makes something trendy that lots of little kids are into these days(nu-metal, or 'metal' that the general public can bob their head to).  they do it well.  but the trouble with trendy music is that it's not challenging at all.  when i listen to this album, i don't hear anything 'new' or 'different' or 'thought provoking' or 'wacky/creative', i just hear something i know i've heard before and it's not as good.  it's like pop music, but with more distortion.  lacksidaisical, happy go lucky, 'catchy', danceable/moshable, non threatening in any way.<br />but a couple million teenagers that haven't really lived life because they're so young can't be wrong, can they?  they know what's up, right? they KNOW 'good' music when they hear it... sure....<br />if you would like to hear something a little more provocative and heartfelt check out the Dead Kennedys.  it's not as 'heavy'(cuz it's punk you knave), but it's definately a more enriching listening experience.
B00005NOOH|5.0|Television documentaries are notoriously quick to date - the assumptions and methodologies of one generation are rejected as inadequate by the next.  In any case, the trend has moved from sweeping panoramas, to small-scale, small-focus micro-histories.  <br />So, after 30 years, how does the massive 'World at War' hold up?  Surprsingly well, actually.  There are a number of reasons for this.  Although it is a single documentary with an overall coherence, drive and tone, it is also a series of 26 discrete hour-long documentaries, each written and directed by different talents.  <br />As a whole, these documentaries create a totality, exploring all the connecting elements of the war: the pre-history of all the major countries; detailed accounts, analyses and reminiscnces of the major events, battles, leaders, tactics; memories of 'ordinary' civilians and combatants, as well as the big names (although the former aren't named).  But individually, the leisurely detailed studies of each topic anticipates the methods of the future micro-historians, giving each part requisite dignity within the whole.<br />Another reason for the programme's success is its still astonishing footage, much of it recently released from Germany and Japan, giving fresh visual evidence to old stories.  <br />For me, the programme's continuing validity lies in the fact that it is not really a documentary at all.  'The World at war' is an epic, tragic poem in 26 cantos, narrating the decline of European civilisation, a momento mori for the valiant dead.  The narrative is constructed like a Homeric epic, an account of leaders, enmities, inevitable battles, warriors, desruction, death, aftermath.  <br />Laurence Olivier's narration, possibly the best thing he's ever done, is a remarkable misture of storyteller, poet, witness, disbelieving guide; the scripts ring with metre and poetry rather than grey fact.  Carl Davis' continually inventive score unites and underlines the entire work; the sound-effetsdramatising the footage, unforgivable in a usual context, are perfectly acceptable here.  The image of the destroyed French village, its entire population murdered one afternoon by the Germans, stands as a grimly articulate symbol, not just for the war, but for this documentary, in a genre designed to record and uncover the truth, faced with questions it can never answer - how?  Why?

B000002L99|3.0|Let me just say, I love the Roth era Van Halen.  Eddie is one of my guitar heroes and they have made some classics in their time but I can't really get on with this album. <br />'Good Enough' is (gulp) just a generic rock song, 'Why Can't This Be Love' is probably Hagar's best song with Van Halen, so that's great, a true classic.  'Get Up' however, is just a lot of noise really and nothing much.  'Dreams' as you probably know, is mint.  'Summer Nights,' track 5 starts promising but just ends up being utter cheese, which is a shame.  I mean, you got the 'fun' aspect of songs with Dave Lee Roth and this song tries to recapture it but it justs ends up missing the mark and being something embarrasing to listen to.  It gets better with 'Best of Both Worlds,' a very, very good song that probably rates in one of my fave Van Halen tunes.  'Love Walks In' is another ballad, you either love it or you hate it but whatever you think of it, it doesn't match the writing qualities of Guns N' Roses or Aerosmith.  Track 8, '5150' is amazing.  It really is good. 'Inside' is well weird for Van Halen, a strange track.  Oh well.<br />So, 4 classic songs and others that you can just about tolerate but I'd expect much more from Van Halen.  I suggest you go and buy 'Van Halen 1' and '1984.'  Pick this album up if you see it in a bargain bin.

0385474547|5.0|Having read the book twice, I can defentely say that Things Fall Apart is a book that can give a good account of what happened to native people as they were being colonialized. To often when people look at colonialism they focus on things like the green areas belong to France, the red areas to England and they brown ones to Spain. Things Fall Apart deals with colonialism differently. They tend to emphasis trade and look at the whold process in economic terms. There was a great deal of loss in terms of life, community and culture. This book will help give people a better understanding of the human side to colonialism in terms of what those being conquered went through.

6305081751|5.0|I originally saw this movie back in 1985 and it really moved me.  I just saw it again last night and found it even more touching than the first time.  It really taught me a more profound lesson this time, in that society is guilty of judging people purely by looks rather than who they are inside.  I, myself am guilty of this to an extent.  Mask looks at Rusty Dennis, a seriously disfigured teen, who struggles through life events that most of us take for granted everyday, like going to school without having people stare, or dating.  Upon seeing this movie again the symbolism strikes me on a whole new level.  Not only does Rocky represent society's judgemental side but so do his biker family members.  We all assume that bikers are loser criminals with no emotions but in this film we see just how untrue that can be.  They protected him like any real family with love and respect.  Special credit goes to the actor's portrayal of Dozer, who speaks only a few words in the film but still manages a great performance of heart-felt compassion for Rocky that I found touching.  Cher also put in a great performance for this film, as the mother struggling with her own demons, while still exhibiting a deep, protective love for her son.  Parents could learn a lesson from her great aptitude for instilling confidence in a child faced against much cruelty in the world.  Maybe we'd have less school violence then.  Finally, on Eric Stoltz, I really think he at least deserved an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Rocky, no easy role to pull off.  I worked as an extra on a film set a few years ago and got the chance to meet him.  I really wanted to tell him how much I respected his performance in Mask but he pulled one of those star &quot;ego trips&quot; on the set so I kept my feelings to myself.  I guess we have to remember that the actor really is different from the character we see on screen.  All the same watch this movie, I guarantee you will take away something positive from it.
0792844882|4.0|Interesting movie about a very young lady who wants nothing more than to be a star.  A star of Vegas showroom.  She meets some interesting characters, and is both supported and challenged by her nemesis the star of a large glitz production.  Some very erotic and some very interesting dances by the lead Berkley.  She carries the show as well as she can.  Not the most original story in the world--but worth sitting through for some good dances and interesting array of characters she meets both good and bad.
0783225970|3.0|There is no denying that Brian DePalma's Scarface is well designed.  Consider the pivotal nightclub sequence, where Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is shaken down by a crooked cop, covets his boss's girlfriend, displays an unhealthy jealousy of his sister's flirtations with a flashy lowlife, and then is almost assassinated by a couple of guys with machine guns - all in the space of a few minutes.  Oliver Stone's screenplay tosses all of these elements into the air like brightly colored rubber balls.  DePalma juggles them deftly with his ever-mobile camera.  The actors help make it all gel by turning in solid performances.  Yet, there are things subtly wrong with it - from the nightclub comedian (Richard Belzer) not quite making sense with his monologue, to the extras all looking like they're watching different shows - their reactions wildly differing in tone and timing.<br />If all this seems like nitpicking, check out a scene from any film by Kubrick or Kurosawa.  It will almost certainly hold up to greater scrutiny.<br /><br />Despite these reservations, I like Scarface quite a bit.  It is a good example of slick, modern cinematic storytelling, with a lot of character development happening visually (if, at times, a bit awkwardly - like the \\"jealousy\\" stuff: a tight close up Al Pacino's eyes as he looks at his sister, while Giorgio Moroder makes weird noises on the soundtrack.  Uh, right).<br />The new documentary on the making of Scarface is nicely made, with a lot of revealing interview material with DePalma himself.  If you listen closely, he even obliquely calls himself a \\"great director\\".  That's forgivable - a huge ego is a definite asset for an auteur.<br />Less forgivable is the dismal film transfer, with its milked out blacks, obvious compression artifacts, lack of detail, visible grain, and plain old letterboxed (rather than anamorphic) widescreen.  It seems almost inconceivable that Universal would foot the expense for decent supplemental material, then stick us with what looks like a badly compressed analog telecine transfer from the 80's.<br />Whatever you think of Scarface, it is one of the most influential films of the past 20 years.  It deserved better.with what looks like a badly compressed analog telecine transfer from the 80's.  <br />Whatever you think of Scarface, it is one of the most influential films of the past 20 years.

B00003CX9E|5.0|I think this is 235 or something. That alone should be enough to tell you something about the power that this movie still commands to generate controversy, to offend, to hypnotize, and to shock. And if you don't enjoy films that can do that 60 years after they were made, you should probably be browsing the music section.<br />There are a lot of folks who will tell you this film &quot;sucks&quot; pretty much because of where it finished in some poll of snobs. They don't like snobs. So they trash the film. That's missing the point.<br />Some others try to outsnob the snobs, by making hyperarcane references to camera angles, cuts and lost films of the 1910s and 1920s. They miss the point too.<br />But, if you can get past all the social and personal problems of the many unedited reviewers here, and simply plug in this film with a bowl of popcorn and a beer on a Thursday night -- and somehow manage to watch withut prejudice -- you almost can't help but be entertained. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is still maybe the most watchable movie I've ever seen. Dark, mysterious, glorious and wistful. You don't need a PhD to see what kind of man Kane could be and the kind of man he becomes. However, if you DO happen to have a PhD, there's more intellectual meat the the bone of this film than many smart folks can digest in a lifetime.<br />Bottom line: &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is going to be as close as any film will ever come to being all things to all people. Which is still a long way from actually being that -- thus the controversy -- but getting even this close is an exhilirating trip.
B000021YQV|5.0|Let me start off by saying that SOAD's debut blew my friggin mind. It was the freshest most original release to come out in a good many years and is still one of my favorite albums of all time. Now as most bands seem to disappoint me after their first album (ie. Staind, Incubus, Limp Bizkit....) I was a little hesitant about the new SOAD, but I bought it anyway. BR>This new album surpasses anything they've done. Everything about this album is awesome. Lyrics, music, vocals, production...EVERYTHING! The vocals are some of the best you'll hear. I can't say enough good things about this album. There is one bad thing about it, though..........It's too darn short!
B000002HGD|5.0|Everything is right with this album.  This must be Moby's most eclectic and hence most innovative release, coming as it did in 1995, a year still dominated by alternative music in the post-Cobain era.<br />There's the standard techno &quot;Feeling So Real,&quot; &quot;Everytime You Touch Me,&quot; and &quot;Bring Back My Happiness.&quot; and &quot;Anthem.&quot;  The last two have more BPM's.  After the opening synthesizers of the latter, get ready to jack your body into rave overdrive!  &quot;Anthem&quot; would definitely fit in a car mix-tape, but be careful not to get too carried away with it, because when BPM begins to equal MPH, a B&amp;W will give you a speeding ticket.<br />There are simple piano compositions like the opener, &quot;Hymn,&quot; and the title track.  &quot;What Love&quot;, with Moby's distorted and monstrous vocals, contains an industrial NIN sound.  It's like Pearl Jam's &quot;Spin The Black Circle&quot; being given a Trent Reznor remix job.  This is the hardest track on the album.  &quot;First Cool Hive&quot; and &quot;Into The Blue&quot; fall into Enigma-style ambient.<br />The last two songs constitute another glass from the bottle of pleasant melancholy I constantly drink from.  &quot;God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters&quot; is a 7:20 orchestral instrumental with piano.  The rhythm keeps repeating, along with a single pound of a bass drum, with a cymbal crash added later, slowly gaining in volume until it reaches a majestic crescendo before sinking back down in volume.  Part of this song is played at the end of Heat, after Robert de Niro dies.<br />&quot;When It's Cold I'd Like To Die&quot; is a nominee for a song I'd like to here as I'm drawing my last breath.  The mental image I form in my head is myself floating down the Thames.  London's bright lights are the candles at my vigil, and as the song fades, I slowly sail down the river's mouth and into the ocean.  It's a lovely song of.  I don't want to swim the ocean/I don't want to fight the tide/I don't want to swim forever/When it's cold I'd like to die&quot;.  Mimi Goese's forlorn vocals give it a blissfully heavenly ambience.<br />The essays included in the album sleeve demonstrate how thoughtful, intelligent, and conscientious Moby is.  He promotes a vegetarian diet, priority in caring for the environment, tolerance of race, creed, and individual beliefs, and decries the agenda of the Christian right.  And if the list of facts he's collected in the sleeve doesn't stir you, you must be six feet underground.  Yes, everything is wrong, including not listening to this eclectic masterpiece.ight the tide/I don't want to swim forever/When it's cold I'd like to die&quot;.

6301562178|4.0|&quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; is the movie that REALLY took us into the disaster movie craze. Now, I know that &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; predates this one, and that most people would say that was the first disaster movie. But think about it: &quot;PA&quot; concerned a small knot of people engaged in one coherent effort, climbing up through the bowels of the capsized ship. They had one identifiable leader, were all characters that you cared about,  and they faced all the crucial scenes together--more like &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;. &quot;TL&quot;, however, had the cutting to different actors trapped in different scary scenes, the lack of cohesion in solving the problem that results in things getting worse before they get better, actors who let their stupid love problems get in the way of what they're trying to accompish, and even actors that you're glad die in the fire because they deserve to. Now, THAT's a disaster movie!<br />Yes, &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; is a disaster movie, but I like it. I hated the villains, and I cheered on the &quot;cool&quot; heroes. And there are stars galore from every era and genre up to that time: Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Faye Dunaway, Robert Vaughn, Richard Chamberlain, Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones, Susan Blakely, OJ Simpson, and William Holden spring to mind most quickly. So you feel right at home, seeing old ballroom dancers, former spies,  and reformed motorcycle guys join up with a football star to get the monster blaze under control. What's not to like?
B000002J1I|4.0|I believe I am a loyal Yes fan, having an appreciation for nearly everything they've done. When it comes to Tormato, I am constantly fascinated as much by the ignorance and swift rejection of this album, as I am with its material. Why does this record get so little attention from Yes fans and the media alike - not to mention the band itself? Notwithstanding this, I believe Tormato has a curious blend of creative ideas with some of the best performances ever from the band. <BR>I challenge all naysayers to listen carefully to the brilliance of the arrangements in &quot;FutureTimes/Rejoice&quot;, the memorable melody in &quot;Don't Kill the Whale&quot;, or the splendid performances in &quot;Release, Release&quot;, for example. Perhaps all critics of this album can't help but to compare it with &quot;Fragile&quot;, etc., but I enjoy it in absolute terms - most of the songs are simply beautiful, creative compositions albeit shorter in length. In all fairness, maybe it just never got the promotion it needed from the start. I have only one kick worth mentioning: &quot;Circus of Heaven&quot; and &quot;Onward&quot; should really be on Jon's and Chris' solo albums, respectively. To me, they sound too personal to belong on a Yes record. &quot;On the Silent Wings of Freedom&quot; is a very ambitious track (the longest one) highlighting Chris' bass guitar work. &quot;Madrigal&quot; sounds very classical featuring harpsichord and nylon string guitar, while &quot;Arriving UFO&quot; is just plain fun to listen to with its whimsical parts from each instrument.<BR>All in all, Tormato may lack a central theme like &quot;Tales...&quot;, but it IS a combination of GREAT music in its own right. I appreciate what it has to offer. Why not give it a fair chance?
B00005NW02|5.0|I don't usually give 5 stars for an album but I think I will go against that for this. This is one of those albums that you may need to listen through a few times to truly respect it. What I find to be most amazing about this album is the band's choice of having more musical diversity. It is a pleasure to hear that a band of this nature can still remain musical and not go for a hard core sound only. I definately recommend this album.

B00005A46T|3.0|I was really excited to buy this cd because I have been a hardcore listener for a really long time and I couldn't have been any happier when their first album came out. It was original and didn't sound like the same blur all over the place. This CD on the other hand is very repetitive. It is just Cannibal Corpse with a screamer rather than a growler. Don't get me wrong, I love cannibal corpse but the same speed throughout an album gets boring really quick. It has it's moments of pace change but not even close enough. I have heard the cd at least 4 times and could only tell you that like 2 songs stick out in my head. For me to give a band a 4 or above, there needs to be at least 5 GREAT songs on the album. Like I said, I don't hate this ablum, I just don't think it lives up to the first.
B0000560X3|5.0|This work is the ideal point of balance because stile is in the middle of hard rock and commercial pretension. Compenetration of members of the band is maximun, and achieved plenty maturitty.
B000002LND|5.0|This is how I remember Madonna. You know, back in grade school when your parents didn't want you to listen to her because &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; was so dirty and scandalous. All of her best known and loved songs are on here. From the opening tracks of &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Lucky Star&quot; (which sound a lot like some of her newer tracks) to greats like &quot;Cherish&quot; and &quot;Vogue.&quot; I challenge you to resist the urge to sing along with this CD-it's impossible! The memories just come flooding back whenever I pop this CD into my car stereo, or listen to it at home. Best bets: Borderline, Like A Virgin, Into the Groove (one of the best dance songs EVER), Like A Prayer, and Cherish. The only drawbacks for me are the last two songs, &quot;Justify My Love&quot; (hard to sing along to, but kinda sexy) and &quot;Rescue Me&quot; which are probably two of the weakest songs she's recorded. Also, this CD makes a great companion to her other collection, Something to Remember, which sort of completes her greatest hits collection.

076790382X|1.0|At one point in Bill Bryson's &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself...,&quot; the author's wife proclaims &quot;You're always complaining in that column.&quot;  I couldn't agree more.  While some may be amused by the constant and often unwarranted grumblings of an unappreciative 40-something, I found myself searching hard for traces of humor and wit. Comprised of a series of articles on &quot;life in the US&quot; written for a British newspaper upon his return to the States after 20 years in England, Bryson's book comes off as a whiny oversimplification of situations that are generally not funny and oftentimes barely even mildly amusing.  While the book contains brief moments of truly clever humor, it is largely filled with exaggerated accounts of Bryson's inability to cope with life in general (I have the feeling that he didn't do much better in Merry Old England).  Bryson's articles hint that Americans are over-stimulated, unappreciative, under-educated clods who don't hold a candle to the British.  After several chapters, this becomes increasingly annoying.  Many of the essays deal with situations or sentiments that simply are not true of life in the U.S.  In his rants about the IRS and state and Federal budgets, it is clear that he doesn't have a clue what he is talking about - and the end result is just not funny.  I have lived abroad myself and cannot help but feel that Bryson was shamelessly pandering to his British audience when he wrote these articles.  I skipped many of the essays because they were too whiney, too annoying or too off the mark.  <br />I was truly disappointed by this book, especially since I had heard how funny and witty Bryson is -- perhaps his abilities are not properly highlighted in &quot;I'm a Stranger Her Myself.&quot;  I found this book to be a collection of boring complaints and meaningless commentary on mundane and oft-times wrongly portrayed aspects of supposed life in the United States.  He states at one point in the book that he doesn't &quot;understand most things.&quot;  No kidding.  Maybe if he knew what he was talking about, he could inject some more humor into his writing.  Or maybe his wife should give writing a try...
B00005NW02|5.0|System of a Down is one of the best bands out today. This bands music is so unique and the singer, Serj Tankian, has one of the best voices I have ever heard. It's hard to think that System can make this album any better than the first one because their first album was outstanding but they did. This album is one of the best albums I heard in a long time. They come right at you from the beginning with &quot;Prison Song&quot; and end with the musical song &quot;Arto&quot;. The whole album is good but there are a few songs that really stand out on this album. &quot;Forest&quot; might be their best song ever, &quot;Deer Dance&quot; is one of the hardest songs on the album and the song &quot;Science&quot; is one of their best as well. To anyone looking for a great rock album look no further. This album should put System of a Down on the map with all the other great rock groups. If you are looking for an album that you want to listen to over and over again, buy this album immediately. It gets better everytime you listen to it. This album is a must have in anyones cd collection. You will not regret this one bit.
0684803356|5.0|This is a unique novel in the Hemingway collection, it has a plot. This is the longest of his novels though the easiest to describe. The Hemingway style is not as lean as in earlier works, one might even say it is pleasantly plump in comparison (as Papa himself was at the time of writing). I'll never forget my first reading of this book. One of those books you put down and just hold your breath with the memory of it all. This might best be described as Hemingway fare for non Hemingway fans. Though Hemingway fans like it too, but it will always be number three to them. The Sun Also Rises is perhaps one of the more difficult books to summarize and Hemingway's style is so new in it that the book created a buzz that has still not died down. What was not said in that first book left some feeling a bit famished. Others were intrigued by this new kind of writing that held its cards so close to its chest. In this book you get a more conventional novel of a novel though the events described in it are very powerfully told. (It is fun to see pictures of Hemingway as a reporter at this time. A world famous novelist in the field.) This book along with A Farewell to Arms prove no American knew better how to convey by written words that nasty busines of war better than Hemingway. Robert Jordan is one of the least talked about Hemingway characters ever. Perhaps because he is a character invented to serve a plot. You will love this book of fighting and love in the Spanish mountains. John Donne himself I think would have proudly read and enjoyed this.
B00005NW02|5.0|System of a Down is one of the best bands out today. This bands music is so unique and the singer, Serj Tankian, has one of the best voices I have ever heard. It's hard to think that System can make this album any better than the first one because their first album was outstanding but they did. This album is one of the best albums I heard in a long time. They come right at you from the beginning with &quot;Prison Song&quot; and end with the musical song &quot;Arto&quot;.

B00005NOOH|5.0|The premier WWII documentary has finally made it to DVD. A perfect format considering the detailed insight that it delivers. A High quality production shot in 16 mm film, narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier.<br />A must have for any WWII buff!
B000059MEK|5.0|I absolutely loved this cd.  It's the best I've heard! When I first listened to it, my sister and I agreed we had to get it! The next day we bought it and we've been dancin' to it ever since! I give it one million stars!<BR>Every song is different, and the tunes will have you dancin' before you know it.  A great cd for clubs and dances. (Even though I'd rather keep the cd to myself!) For anyone who doesn't have it, I suggest you buy it right away.
0553288105|4.0|Hugo and Nebula Award winner. The book is divided into 3 sections, each taking its title from a portion of a quote from a play by the German playright Schiller: &quot;Against Stupidity, the Gods Themselves Contend in Vain&quot;. The book is dedicated &quot;To Mankind, and the hope that the war against folly may someday be won, after all&quot;.<br />In the first section, Dr. Peter Lamont is recalling the story of the discovery of the &quot;electron pump&quot; process. Dr. Frederick Hallam had stumbled onto a discovery that a jar formerly<BR>containing Tungsten-186 now contained Plutonium-186 (20 neutrons turned into 20 protons, with a net release of energy). He was assisted by Benjamin Allan Denison, a radiochemist. It turns out that Hallam is neither especially bright nor very well liked by his colleagues, but he ends up becoming a hero to the public at large for his fortuitous discovery.<br />In the course of his research, Dr. Lamont interviews Hallam and suggests that Hallam and other humans had had little to do with the development of the electron pump, since the instructions had been sent from an unknown source (the same as the source of the<BR>chemical change). For this impertinence, Hallam ruins Lamont's career. This causes Lamont to dig deeper into the process and develop a theory that the process will be dangerous to Earth in the near future.<br />The danger lay in the fact that, by pumping electons into the parauniverse, its physical laws were slowly seeping into our universe (and vice versa). This meant that the strong nuclear force was gradually becoming weaker in our universe (stronger in the parauniverse). Since the sun works on nuclear fusion, its rate of fusion would increase until it eventually became unstable and the sun exploded. The other physicists knew of this danger but assumed an even distribution in our universe of the effect of the pumping, which meant that there would no danger for eons. Dr. Lamont, on the other hand, understood that the changes would be localized to the areas near the pumping stations and the dangerous effects much more concentrated.<br />In the course of Dr. Lamont's research, he even has several cryptic communications with the &quot;para-universe&quot;, the presumed source of the conversion process, which his friend and<BR>colleague Dr. Myron Bronowski helps to translate. These messages seem to indicate that someone on the &quot;other side&quot; is also aware of danger. Unfortunately, as the Schiller quote implies, stupidity wins and Lamont's theory is scoffed at due primarilly to his bad standing with the revered Hallam.<br />In the second section, we meet a few of the inhabitants of the para-universe and learn about their society. The common folks are divided into 3 types, rationals, emotionals and parentals. In addition to these are the &quot;Hard Ones&quot;, who seem to be the ones really running things. Events involve one particular triad, whose emotional (Dua) secretly longs to be a rational. She ends up learning about the process and manages to send warning messages to the other side.<br />In the last section, we find ourselves on Luna, with Dr. Denison arriving there as a permanent immigrant (&quot;immi&quot;) from Earth. He has become disillusioned with Earth, since Hallam has managed to stunt his career as he had done to Lamont earlier. With the help<BR>of a new friend, Selene (rhymes with 'sell any'), a tour-guide and friend of a local physicist, Denison manages to actually measure the dangerous effect that Lamont had predicted and<BR>prove his theory to be true. He also proposes a solution; finding another para-universe to pass the extra protons to, making Earth merely a transit station and causing no permanent<BR>change to its natural laws.<br />All ends well, with Hallam getting his comeuppance on Earth and Lamont and Denison being honored as heros. Denison chooses to stay on Luna with his new girlfriend, Selene.<br />This is a great science fiction story, highlightedby interesting characters, realistic scientific explanations, plausible basic proposition and an especially imaginative description of the alien world, its inhabitants and their culture.<br />Asimov observes the foibles of mankind but, being an atheist, is unable to rely upon God to guide world events and eventually make things right (we sense his eco-panic, common among atheists and a familiar theme in current events). In place of God, he therefore proposes human intelligence (i.e. learning, science) as the solution to mans problems, ignoring the fact that this tool can be (and has been) used for both good and evil. Man needs more than knowledge, learning, intelligence or science, as important as these are. He needs forgiveness, moral insight and guidance, and courage to do the right thing. Against God, the demigods themselves contend in vain.

B00000JCB2|4.0|What more can you ask for from Limp Bizkit?  You've got great tunes to crank up and yell with.  Tunes like these, especially &quot;Break Stuff&quot; definitly let you vent frustrations.
B00000DFSK|3.0|An acceptable but not substantial Best Of with a fair multitude of big tracks by a band any dedicated listener however would no doubt expect more from. What should have been included are the half the dozen or so songs that I'm sure U2 and all its band members were aware could better have made this collection complete. What I believe would have made a huge difference had they been selected were the essential tracks `Gloria`, `Seconds`, `Two Hearts Beat As One`, `Bullet The Blue Sky`, `Running To Stand Still` and `In God's Country`. Had the monotonous almost repetitive `Bad` been removed as was the R`N B anti-U2 style formatted `When Love Comes To Town`, all aforementioned songs could have been their replacement still leaving slack for the standard 80 min. single disc limit. Typical however, these big bands always prefer to make available on hit CD's just enough popular songs to make past albums and their tracks I guess not seem insignificant or obsolete...
B00005B4GU|4.0|Sometimes it seems as if the album were made before Kid A, considering that some songs sound like OK Computer, it kind of leads off where OK Computer was and still has the Kid A vibe in songs like &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; and the Kid A B-side &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac.&quot; At the same time, songs like the awesome &quot;Knives Out&quot; have the Kid A sound, and they can move on with songs like &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and my personal favorite (one of them, at least), &quot;I Might Be Wrong.&quot; Even though Thom uses a high note in that song. This is a good thing, because it's been some time since I've heard from them, and if you like Travis' new album, be sure not to forget this.
B00005LMWI|5.0|If you haven't heard Khan's voice you missed out.He's one of the best vocalists out there along with Timo Kotipelto,Joachim Cans and Ralph Scheepers.Amazing guitar work and powerful lyrics.These guys are going be the new power metal gods if they keep this up.I can see it already...&quot;with strong influence by Kamelot&quot;.Get it.Love it.Devour it.
B00005NW02|5.0|This album is beyond genious. System of a Down are one of the few bands today to pull of such amazing work. They are probably one of the most talented bands ever. Every song on here is amazing. I especially like ATWA and Aerials. SOAD mix metal and melody and make it sound absolutely incredible. Buy this album!! You wont be disappointed. Check them out on the Pledge of Allegiance tour with Slipknot. Get slipknot too!!!!! So many cds!!!
0812550706|1.0|I know everyone seems to love this book, but I hated it! It isn't &quot;science&quot; fiction (like A.C. Clark books), but fiction. I could not suspend my belief THAT much to appreciate what the pre-pubescent main character could do. Perhaps I'm too old (30?). I think this book appeals to pre-high school kids, but it did nothing for me.
B00005NW02|5.0|Since System of a Down's premier on the music scene nothing has been the same. System is consistently inventive and wild, and always either in the state of or pushing towards thought provoking. This album is no exception. A varied experience between the insane and the melodic, with a generally less dark feel than the first album. Serj's randomly fluctuating vocals still stud every song and the interesting guitar style presented by Daron is relatively unchanged.<br />The albums starts off on the right foot, with the insanely enjoyable Prison Song. The noted radio hit Chop Suey! is of course a worthwhile song. X and Needles are both excellent, the Russian chant sound in Needles is instantly addictive. The album is loaded with traditional 2 minute or less System songs which pack all the instensity of a normal band's 4 or 5 minute song into a very short period time. <br />The album as a whole is less political than the first, bu that doesn't stop it from having just as many loaded, razor-edged songs. The songs are just as critical of society and modern tendencies as they ever were.<br />In short, anyone looking for another self-titled album is essentially in luck, with the exception of a very minor stylistic difference this album is almost perfectly like the first, and definitely more fun at parts, since it goes into less melodrama.
6303913881|5.0|I actually like this movie.  It's not great and it is not all that bad...  And why are all these people talking about the sleaze and the disgraceful manner in which all these girls are put through.  Okay so all the girls are naked. So what!?  It's not like they were forced to sign on the dotted line when they agreed to do the movie.  Who cares about the bad acting and the bad story line and all the nudity. Get a grip people it is a movie.  A guilty pleasure.  I really hate it when all the femmanazis organizations are talking bad about films when women are naked. Didn't women always use sex for power through the ages.  Didn't Cleopatra use sex to get Ceasar?  And wasn't Crstal a strong character in this movie and didn't she try to help Naomi in the end?  Hello?  Again I have to say this is movie so enjoy and take great pleasure in watching a very funny look at the Vegas showgirl life.
B00005NW02|5.0|Well, I was thouroughly blown away by System of a Down's last album, and this one was even better. Some of the best hard rock I've ever heard, this is the perfect kind of music to jump around and mosh to. The songs fit together on the CD quite well, and it feels more like a whole album than just a collection of songs. If you've heard System of a Down before, this will blow you away. If you haven't, prepare to be shocked; this is the best it gets in hard rock right here. This CD is a dish best served loud. ROCK ON!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Strikingly original and gloriously film-noir, Memento is a rare film that finds the perfect marriage between substance and style without sacrificing the tension, drama, and humor in its well-written script.  The first offering from writer-director Christoper Nolan, and adapted from one of this own short stories, Memento engages audiences of all levels in a murder mystery of the first caliber.<br />Leonard (Guy Pierce) is hot on the trail of the man who murdered and killed his wife.  He, too, was injured in the attack, rendering him unable to record any new memories - everything fades after around 10 minutes.  Although he remembers everything until he blacked out, including his wife lying dead on the floor, he has formed no new memories since that time.  This unusual condition has obviously rendered his search somewhat problematic, and Leonard is forced to rely on scribbled notes, photographs, maps, and tattoos to attempt to piece together his investigation.<br />In what has been described alternately as a pedantic, pretentious film-school choice and a masterful way to tell a story, the story is told in 10-minute segments, starting at the END and working backwards.  Therefore, the audience can piece things together in a way Leonard cannot, and our reality becomes totally different from the main characters'.  In fact, one could make the case that Memento is a meditation on the meaning and reliability of memory in and of itself, but I'll leave that one to the scholars.<br />With its legions of fans, it's a wonder this DVD wasn't released with more extras on it.  In fact, there are FOUR different versions of Memento on the world market, and all four DVDs have their strengths and weaknesses.  The American NTSC-format Region 1 version, seen here, has an interview and the incredible Memento website on it (which, I should note, adds to the story, but only look at it after you've seen the movie, because it might spoil some things).  The Canadian version of the film, also a Region 1 NTSC DVD by Alliance, has no extras but has an option where you can select the film's chapters in chronological order, allowing you to see the movie &quot;backwards&quot; (forwards, really).  The French and Belgian version is Region 2 PAL, and lacks all the extras but has an option where you can actually play the film in chronological order, instead of having to go back to the chapter screen 48 times.  And, last but not least, the planned UK Region 2 PAL release (slated to hit the streets on January 14, 2002) will have a director's commentary, the &quot;play chronologically&quot; feature, but none of the American version's extras.<br />This shouldn't surprise people, as Memento was released first in the UK and did significantly better there at the box office than it did here.  However, unless you want to import a DVD from Europe - which requires a DVD player configured not only to play Region 2 discs, but one that can translate a PAL signal to an NTSC signal - the American version will be just fine.  The picture and sound are great, and the chronological mode is basically, as a friend put it, a gimmick.  And, with a movie as good as this, we can live without a commentary.egion 1 NTSC DVD by Alliance, has no extras but has an option where you can select the film's chapters in chronological order, allowing you to see the movie &quot;backwards&quot; (forwards, really).

B00000AFWW|5.0|When I first bought this CD, I thought that it would be a totally lame album considering that it is a &quot;new side&quot; of Hole.  Well, I listened to it and it's not lame at all!  On tunes like &quot;Awful&quot; and &quot;Use Once And Destroy,&quot; the soul of the early 90's Hole shines through a Pop-rock exterior.  On other tracks like &quot;Malibu&quot; and &quot;Boys on the Radio,&quot; one hears a new side of Hole, a deep and touching pop sound (keep some tissues around).  This album proves that Hole is more than a abrasive punk band -- it has the ability to adapt to almost any style of Rock that one can concieve.
B00005NW02|5.0|Wow is a great word to describe this album. Ive been waiting three months to get it and its finally here. This is definately good for anyone how likes hardcore, death-metal, or punk. SOAD has elements of all three. This is definately worth the buy.
B00004Z459|1.0|This album is the most overproduced, techno drenched, repetitive collection of songs i have heard in this new nu metal revolution.<br />The most grating thing about this album is that, take away the metal guitar and &quot;cool&quot; effects, what you are listening to is bascially another boy band. They are one of the most heavily stage managed and image concious bands out there (apart from the arabian guy, he's just a bit of a rogue in there). Even the melodies and lyrics are boy band-ish and lack any real soul or conviction.<br />And for god's sake they changed their name to be right next to limp bizkit in your record store! If that's not sleeing out to the men in suits then what is?!<br />If all you &quot;cool crazy cats&quot; want to listen to some real rock music, with real emotions, real power and real convictions, then buy Relationship of Command by At The Drive-in.<br />Actually, i change my mind. Don't buy it. That just makes it all the more special for fans of the band (and for fans of real music) to listen to.<br />So yeah, go on, buy Linken Park. Listen. &quot;Love&quot;. Whatever...
B00005A46T|5.0|Don't belive these guys.  I even own MATE FEED KILL REPEAT;The first one of theres,this is there thrid cd.  This is more intense then there old ones.  Don't be surprised if this cd has to remove a song like the last one (purity i found the demo version of the cd.)Buy this cd you will love it if you go in the mind set this is the next cd.  Not this will be the greatest cd ever that always ruins the cd.   This cd is better then the old one it is more musical...well for SLIPKNOT better songs more intense.
B00005NW02|5.0|Wow, I am speechless after hearing this album. This cd has very good lyrics and ausome riffs. it is the best.
